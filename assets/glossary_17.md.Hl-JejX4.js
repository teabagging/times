The title of the anthology, which opens the season at the Whole Theater company, refers to familiar classical music as played by the Boston Pops Orchestra.

In the opening play, ''Can-Can,'' he crosscuts two love stories, one between an American soldier on leave and a young French woman, the other between a prospective bride and an older woman. In each case, for different reasons, the match is impossible, but, for the people concerned, the relationship will prove to be unforgettable. Although the French half of the play could be expanded, the author is content with conveying the essence of a rhapsodic romantic experience, as tenderly evoked by the actors, Sam Tsoutsouvas and Adrienne Thompson.
