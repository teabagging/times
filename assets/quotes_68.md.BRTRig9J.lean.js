Bennett was simply underwhelming. Mr. Bennett did what a wag once suggested we do about the Vietnam War: \\"Declare a victory and go home.\\"   He quit, you write, just when there appear \\"glimmers of hope that the nation's crack epidemic may have peaked.\\" Surely, to say that drug addiction and abuse came to their highest point during William Bennett's watch is nothing for him to brag about.    But, you imply, with more wish fulfillment than credible scientific evidence, after this \\"peak\\" we'll see a decline, for which there are those \\"glimmers of hope.\\"   A more sober evaluation of Mr. Bennett's 19-month reign gives less cause to cheer. Some basic questions are still to be answered:   When he took office, Mr. Bennett was quoted as designating the District of Columbia as \\"the first high-intensity drug-trafficking area\\" in the country, and he proposed a \\"landmark plan\\" (chiefly relying on more prisons). As he leaves, one might ask whatever happened to that plan? Or is Washington still a \\"high-intensity drug-trafficking area\\"?   How much more do we know now, after Mr. Bennett's 19 months, about the cause of drug abuse? What research has been conducted and with what results? How much more do we know about treatment methods? The \\"solid intellectual base\\" you refer to is less than visible.   As to those \\"encouraging statistics,\\" still with us are drug-related crime, violence and turf wars in the inner cities, and overwhelmed and underfunded treatment centers.   Officeholders come and go (and make hay for future careers), but drug despair, drug violence, drug crime and drug misery stay with us, impervious to grandstanding and politics.

Quite apart from anything else, it includes what has to be one of the most haunting pictures painted anywhere in Europe in the year 1901. This is the painting called ''Five Friends'' by a Danish artist called Vilhelm Hammershoi, who was born in 1864 and died in 1916. The canvas is roughly six feet high and 10 feet wide and it was clearly intended to be a definitive statement about both the nature of friendship and the character of the art world in which Hammershoi spent his life.   The five men in question - an architect, an art historian and three painters - were united in their respect for one another and their espousal of the progressive art of their day.

George Wallace barred the door to blacks, repeated her message that it was possible for Iraq to throw off its legacy of violence and oppression to become a viable democracy.

At the same time, each performs her own act of rebellion -- or is it penitence? Because of their disparities, they are heroines to one another.   Ms. Wasserstein's generous group portrait (at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater) is a not only a comedy but also a play of character and shared reflection as the author confronts the question of why the sisters behave as they do.

Such districts lead to increased sales volume and better municipal services.    The June 23 editorial ''To The City: Get Out of People's Way'' accurately depicted a ''turf battle'' between the city administration and the Council over who would have jurisdiction to approve new districts. That jurisdictional stalemate prevented any new business improvement districts from being set up since the expiration of the city law in June 1983.  My legislation, offered as a ''workable compromise,'' finally gained the support of both sides. In essence, it would permit the city administration, through the Board of Estimate, to maintain most of the approval authority while giving the City Council a ''statutory voice'' to veto any specific district's formation.  With urgency, working against the clock, the Council voted a Home Rule Message, Governor Cuomo issued a Message of Necessity, implicitly signaling his support by allowing legislative consideration without the normal three-day aging process, and the State Assembly voted unanimously to bring the BIDS program back to New York City.  But the Senate, without explanation, said no.

Wall Street","excerpt":"Watch Out for the Big Guys"},{"year":"2006","title":"THE BASICS -- There's a new tree in Calgary's forest of big-block, high-rise hotels. Or more precisely, there's an old tree with new leaves. The former Holiday Inn, which is in the process of renovation, reopened last summer as a design-driven boutique hotel called the Hotel Arts.     The 12-story tower has a new coat of white paint, bordered with grayish brown and hung with festive banners. The lobby is home to a pair of white pod chairs and abstract paintings in bright colors. During a mid-September visit, the overall impression was not uniformly hip. The elevators with their cheap metal handrails and linoleum floors were a holdover from the hotel's earlier incarnation, as was harsh fluorescent lighting in the lobby and hallways.    THE LOCATION -- The hotel sits on the edge of the city center, within walking distance of Stephen Avenue, a lively shopping and eating promenade. Calgary's light rail system is also within easy reach. Around the corner is the old Scarth Street, the southern part of what is now First Street, with a string of pubs and clubs of several stripes.    THE ROOMS -- There's a bit of schizophrenia going on here. Until the hotel's renovation is complete next April, some floors may still have the Holiday Inn look: a postmodern mix of pink, green and maroon with traditional furniture and carpeting. Others cleave to the modern aesthetic represented by strict right angles and a palette of deep browns, coffee and indigo. The two whirlpool suites are particularly inviting. One of them, Room 1202, was carpeted in a richly textured brown, its two sides separated by an artificial beam of dark brown oak -- the same material used for most of the room's hard furniture. In the sleeping area, backed dramatically by an indigo velour curtain, sat an enormous king bed piled high with soft brown throws and six pillows of varying firmness. Two big square armchairs in brown velour and a matching sofa in coffee microsuede dominated the sitting area. Pulling back another indigo curtain revealed a floor-to-ceiling window and a bracing view of Calgary's skyline, a worthy competitor for the suite's huge flat-screen television.    THE BATHROOMS -- In the whirlpool suite, the bathroom was as big as some European hotel rooms and completely lined in white marble. Four people could comfortably soak in the tub, which is recessed in a raised platform","excerpt":"watch out for the ceiling, though, while climbing in! The showers lacked sufficient water pressure, and towel racks or hooks were missing.    THE CROWD -- If the Hotel Arts wants to be a trendy destination for young jet-setters, it's not hitting its target audience yet. The clientele is still solidly Holiday Inn, a combination of middle-aged business people and older tourists from North America and Europe.    AMENITIES -- Steam rises invitingly from the heated outdoor pool on the mezzanine level. The modest fitness center holds just four exercise machines and a selection of weights. Broadband access is available, for around 10 Canadian dollars a day, via a cable on the desk.    ROOM SERVICE -- Options were limited to a few sandwiches, salads and other dishes while the restaurants were being remodeled; one is expected to reopen in mid-January. A hot and flavorful stir-fry with noodles (15 Canadian dollars plus service and tax) arrived just a few minutes after the predicted 20 minutes. A couple of online commentaries reported food poisoning from the restaurant and room service, both in the pre- and post-Holiday Inn eras, but the shrimp and chicken in the stir-fry were digested without incident.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- You'll have a hard time finding a better deal in the design hotel category, at least in North America. Look for the crowd to evolve as more people discover it.      Hotel Arts, 119 12th Avenue SW, Calgary, Alberta; 403-266-4611 or on the Web at www.hotelarts.ca. Rates start at 129 Canadian dollars (about $113 at 1.14 Canadian dollars to the United States dollar) on weekends and 169 Canadian dollars during the week.

And then, when you have finished chuckling over the absurdities of this melodramatic museum piece (about 1929), sit back and enjoy the gay antics of its more up-to-date companion piece, \\"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.\\"But don't, by any means, miss \\"Wanted Men.\\" For its self-sacrificing hero is none other than Charles Laughton, and the performance will set you to contemplating the marvels that have been wrought in him in seven subsequent years. And its affrighted swooning heroine is Dorothy Gish, who plays her rôle to the last gasp of horror in the style to which the old silent film audiences were accustomed.The picture was made by British and Dominions when the talkies were indeed in their infancy. It was to have been called \\"The Wolves.\\" After a considerable time its first strident print was played back for the producers, and it promptly went on the shelf, probably because the Arctic wind machine had drowned out most of the dialogue. We couldn't catch more than a stray word here and there until about the second reel, and we are told that several reels had already been eliminated because of sound defects. Just why it was revived at all is somewhat of a mystery.Neither Mr. Laughton (who is at present making \\"Rembrandt\\" for Alexander Korda) nor Miss Gish attended the New York première of their picture. Mr. Osterman, somewhat disheveled and confessedly upset, did. Mr. Osterman was one of Broadway's better known masters-of-ceremonies in boom times, and he is more or less noted nowadays as a comedian and gagster in occasional revues. He was lured to England in 1929 at a fabulous figure to do a revue in the new sound medium for Herbert Wilcox. Due to a slight change in plans, as Mr. Osterman says, he found himself in felt boots and parkah, singing rowdy songs to the music of an eighteen-piece orchestra, harps and all, in the Labrador fishing shack reproduced at Elstree.Mr. Osterman had hoped the whole unpleasantness had been forgotten. When he learned that the World Cinema had unearthed a print, however, he started saving up with the idea of perhaps buying it and making a bonfire of it. But the night before the opening a man stepped out of an alley on Fifty-second Street, grasped Mr. Osterman firmly by the wrists with one massive hand and robbed him of the $50.

Mr. Erice's method is modest, yet his film manages to achieve a mesmerizing intensity. The purity and breadth of this meticulous study are all the more gratifying in view of its unprepossessing style.   For nearly two and a half hours, Mr. Lopez Garcia is seen working patiently on his project, observing and painting a small tree that stands in his Madrid backyard. Mr. Lopez Garcia is most emphatically not in a hurry. Neither is Mr. Erice, whose tranquil pace appears to be set by his subject. So the film watches serenely as Mr. Lopez Garcia arrives home with his canvas, stretches it out and nails it to a frame. He is then seen looking long and hard at the tree itself, which he later dots with a series of unexplained white markings.  A string with a weight attached is tied to the foliage, and a horizontal line is drawn along the backyard wall.

Twenty-one surviving leaders of Nazi Germany were about to enter  a court that had been invented for the purpose of judging them. It was the largest crime in history, and it promised the greatest courtroom spectacle.

With their cheap suits and hungry faces, these undistinguished men did not look like the archcriminals  of the age.         What ensued was an excruciatingly long and complex trial that failed to mesmerize a distracted world. Its mass of evidence created boredom, mixed occasionally with an abject horror before which ordinary justice seemed helpless. Its premises caused endless legal controversy. Its finale, 10 messy hangings and a surreptitious suicide, was less than majestic. Its one legacy seemed to be the celebrity of Albert Speer, Hitler's architect and armaments minister, who escaped death with gestures of ambiguous atonement.

He was let go this Nov. 6 and was then signed as a substitute player by Miami. The other man, though, was once quite an impressive player: Billy Taylor, who in two previous seasons had led the Giants in rushing but who, after longtime personal uneasiness with Coach Ray Perkins, was waived Oct. 6, while the club was struggling.

Early footage of community meetings in northern California's Marin and Sonoma Counties where the fence was temporarily erected, indicates opinion in the area was sharply divided, and tempers ran high.One woman feared that allowing Christo to build the fence—which he planned to remove two weeks later—would open the region up to \\"carnivals, rock concerts, motorcycle races, whatever.\\" One man was heard to mutter, \\"I bet he can't even paint a picture—he's an idiot.\\"A friendly looking older woman compared the project to a well-cooked meal: \\"Sometimes I go to a lot of work to prepare a masterpiece, and what happens? It gets eaten up.\\" Later, in a local cafe, one waitress explained that the completed fence wasn't \\"pretty in the sense of pretty, but it looks different, and it's kinda nifty.\\"Directed by Albert Maysles, David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin, the film records the most intriguing reaction of all, that of a herd of sheep seen running beside the fence on a silent, misty morning. The sheep dash towards the barrier so impetuously that they seem about to collide with it","excerpt":"watching them, one can't help wondering what they make of this unexpected obstruction on familiar terrain.The fence is extravagantly lovely, standing 18 feet high and made of a gleaming white fabric that ripples in the wind, but do sheep really care about such considerations? Who can say? In any case, these particular sheep finally find the opening that has been left for them and blithely pass through, as a rancher looks on with a wonderfully knowing expression.There is a great deal of shouting and arguing in \\"Running Fence,\\" but the hubbub is punctuated by wordless interludes like this one, brief sequences that suggest both the large issues and the tiny ones suggested by Christo's undertaking. Very deliberately, the film never explains either Christo or his intentions. But it demonstrates, wordlessly and at times almost magically, that what he hoped to accomplish was very like what he attained.Christo's Running Fence project, shown here in its planning, construction and completed stages, is about as ideal a subject as any documentary film maker could hope to find.Every participant in the process seems keenly aware of and vastly amused by his or her own role, and the camera becomes a welcome, openly acknowledged witness. The particular artfulness of the Haysles brothers and Miss Zwerin lies in their having taken the film beyond the golden opportunity Christo and his fence provided, and into the realm of keen, unerringly even-handed acuity. \\"Running Fence\\" presents its material clearly and impartially, yet it establishes and sustains a distinct point of view. The directors' influence is palpable, yet never meddlesome.\\"Running Fence,\\" which is being shown at the Whitney Museum, is 58 minutes long—an ideal length, but a commercially unwieldy one, unless the film later turns up on television or on a double bill. In any case, for all the books and posters Christo's exhilarating and audacious project will spawn, this is the next best thing to having been there.

But Ms. Silverstone, who made this film just before her comic breakthrough in \\"Clueless,\\" gives a dramatic performance that goes well beyond her earlier movie work. Used in her first films as a rock-video goddess and stereotypical nymphet, she is much more clever here, playing what effectively is a dual role. Cool and naive on the surface, she comes alive in the other characters' furtive, overheated daydreams.         Previously released on video, \\"The Babysitter\\" has been imaginatively rescued by the Film Forum not only as a star vehicle but also as an impressive debut for Guy Ferland, its writer and director. Mr. Ferland has skillfully coaxed a linear narrative out of a fragmented Robert Coover story, weaving a web of sexual fantasy around the baby sitter's provocative presence. Far from exploiting this  material, Mr. Ferland pares away its more lurid possibilities and instead concentrates on plumbing the depths of character.  The baby sitter winds up having dark, unanticipated effects on everyone around her.    FILM REVIEW","excerpt":"Watching Who's Watching Children"},{"year":"1993","title":"DR. JAMES W.

Gucci, which is better known for its shoes and handbags, made a surprisingly strong case for its ready-to-wear. And there was hardly time to assimilate these well-presented messages before Gianfranco Ferre triumphantly closed the week of fall fashion shows today.   The cool professionalism of a master tailor like Armani is always a pleasure. He did not bother to tinker with proportions or decorations. Jackets just slid over the body in a gently fitted line, accompanied most often with easy, comfortable-looking trousers. Colors were mild, with the emphasis on honey shades and light browns. Traditional patterns like checks and herringbones had a pale subtlety. Occasionally, a short vest with a rounded hem peeped from under a jacket. A massive necklace was sometimes worn on the chest, but there was no other jewelry, not even earrings. It was simply the apotheosis of the pants suit as the basic daytime look for the woman of today.  Doing What Works Well    The designer tried a few long, full skirts with his well-cut jackets, and they seemed to work well. Then he gave the suit a dressier tone by adding a touch of metal to the material and a big printed silk shawl edged with fringe to the shoulders. That was fine, too. So were the suits with a gentle ruffle down the inside of the front closing.
