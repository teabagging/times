The attractive Tokarskaya, as the inamorata of the rather weak-minded, intemperate Prince (A. Ktorof), who was chosen by the chief munition manufacturer (L. M. Leonidof) to become his royal servant, also adds verisimilitude to the fable. S. Martinson, a leading Soviet comedian, is excellent in the rôle of the valet mistaken for the new King and forced to go through with the performance. The acting of the cast is splendid, the ballet scenes are alluring and the photography and sound reproduction are clear.The superimposed titles in English are hardly necessary, in view of the simple nature of the tale, which comes to a rather abrupt end with a cannon shot being fired \\"by accident\\" into Russian territory while the \\"King\\" and his valet are engaged in a slapstick battle.

The film, in Russian with English subtitles, opened yesterday at the Lincoln Plaza Cinema, Broadway and 63d Street in Manhattan.     If ever there was a good argument for family life in close quarters it is \\"Adam's Rib,\\" a wonderfully wry Soviet comedy about three generations of women living in nerve-jangling proximity to one another. Sharing a bathroom, some clothes, some onerous chores and a lot more intimacy than any of them bargained for, the heroines of this story manage to make the best of a desperately claustrophobic situation. Review/Film","excerpt":"A Soviet Family That's Close, Very Close"},{"year":"1930","title":"In \\"A Fragment of an Empire,\\" the Soviet producer, Frederick Ermler, gives a vivid conception of a shell-shocked Russian soldier who regains his mental equilibrium some time alter the ???Bolsheviki dispatched the Romanoffs and turned St. Petersburg into Leningrad.In certain respects this film is a trifle sketchy, but it is nevertheless impressive and imaginative. It is grim, sometimes unnecessarily morbid, for in the initial sequence there are scores of dead bodies being loaded on a train. One of them moves. The man is alive, and he becomes one of the characters in the tale that is unfurled in a heliographic fashion.The fragment of the empire is a harsh, cruel person, who happens to have married the shell-shocked soldier's wife, she thinking she was a widow at the time. The motion picture, a silent one, winds up with a caption setting forth:\\"We have still much work to do, comrades.\\"Judging by the story, a part of this work is the eradicating of such men as the unsavory specimen in this film. Very cleverly has the director solved the way in which Sergeant Filimonov becomes rational. Before going to war he had worked with machines in a factory as a hosier and it is the whirring sound of a sewing machine that gradually mends his mind. This is capitally pictured, as is also a later passage in which the sergeant is told of the new master. These flashes dart from factory to factory, to offices and even to the ships on sea, showing that the worker is the master.When this Sergeant Filimonov reaches Russia's capital, he wonders at the changes. Familiar statues have disappeared. Nothing is the same. He finds his old employer, who explains matters to some extent and tells him to go to the Fabcom, the factory committee. The sergeant, dazed and bewildered, asks for Mr. Fabcom, and even long afterward he imagines that the individual who is considerate and kind to him is Mr. Fabcom. This young man, now highly successful, is, incidentally, the one who was found alive among the dead.The sergeant has an unkempt beard. He needs a bath, and in the brief space allotted to his ablutions, there is reflected the relief of the man. His head and face are a mass of white soap lather. It looks funny, but soon it is anything but comic, for after the preliminary flash, it is real. How he is enjoying the bath!Perhaps the director is a trifle too severe with his \\"fragment,\\" for this man, who is an educational teacher, seems to overstep the mark of truth. He is too hard with his wife, having her attend to him like a valet and then, when he teaches his class, with a microphone before him so that unseen pupils can profit by his knowledge, he refers to the necessity of kindness toward wives. It rather looks as if the producer was taking a poke at Trotsky, for this individual, while heavier, often has an expression similar to the former Bolshevik War Commissioner.Feodor Nikitin gives a remarkable portrayal of the shell-shocked soldier. Yacov Goodkin is capital as the soldier saved from a frightful death. Valery Solovtzey makes the instructor thoroughly disagreeable. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A Soviet Film.

Then they have added pictorial accounts of a day in the Soviet capital, of work on a collective farm and of Winter sports in Leningrad and have brought the whole thing to a stirring climax by showing this year's great May Day demonstration in Moscow, with William C. Bullitt, the American Ambassador, an honored guest. Incidentally, Americans now have a chance to hear their envoy in the Soviet Union make his famous little first speech in the Russian language.There is no preaching in this Soviet screen effort, something which makes it all the more effective from a propaganda standpoint. Regardless of all the undenied hardships still obtaining in the Soviet Union, the spectator is bound to be impressed with the mass pictures of a mighty nation at work and at play, and with the feats of individual prowess. Human interest abounds in this film. The affectionate parting between the daring Kara Kum motorists and their wives hardly could be outdone by Hollywood itself.

Kordium, has evidently been influenced by Sergei Eisenstein's work in that impressive old picture, \\"Potemkin.\\" He begins with flashes of the rolling sea outside Odessa, then later he shows insurrectionists parading the same steps trodden by the Cossacks in the Eisenstein production, but his scenes aboard a French warship are lacking in the drama with which Eisenstein fused his glimpses of the mutiny on the Russian cruiser.This film is concerned with the alleged refusal of sailors aboard the French warship Mirabeau in 1918 to fire on Odessa after a successful Bolshevik uprising. M. Kordium darts from land to the movement aboard the Mirabeau, which is supposed to have been ordered to Odessa to protect French interests during that hectic period.Occasionally the action in this offering is somewhat vague, but one gathers that the Russian workers in the French factories and elsewhere in Odessa rebel against their employers and distribute leaflets among persons on land and also, through the efforts of a sympathetic sailor, to the men of the Mirabeau.M. Kordium undertakes to tell of the French officers discovering one of these revolutionary pamphlets in the hands of a Negro member of the crew. There are scenes devoted to depicting this seaman undergoing torture at orders from the French naval officers with the idea of forcing him to tell where he got the printed matter. The black seaman prefers to die rather than give the desired information and his body is thrown into the sea under cover of darkness. It is presumed to be a secret burial, but one would surmise that the fact would become known, considering that a few of the sailors have to be on hand both during the torturing of the Negro and also when the box contaming his body is slipped over the side of the ship.The mutiny consists of one man coming forward and telling the officers that the crew will not fire on the Odessa revolutionists. One officer whips out a pistol to fire at this seaman but the Captain stays the firing of the weapon. Orders are then given for the Mirabeau to leave for France, which apparently satisfies the mutinous crew.M. Kordium's guidance of his players reveals study, for while they do little but express one thought, often with immobile countenances, one reads in the faces of these participants just the idea the director wished to convey.When the Mirabeau is seen first there is heard from the screen the strains of the French march, \\"Le Sambre et Meuse,\\" and during some of the scenes of Bolshevik throngs the clamor of voices is heard, but the latter sounds are badly recorded.As usual with the showing of such propaganda material there was heard yesterday afternoon spasmodic applause, particularly on the showing of a caption, which read: \\"You cannot kill the revolution!\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A Soviet Silent Film.

The merriment in this film is like the bubbles in champagne, and many a genuine wave of laughter is stirred up from those in the brilliant audience. This production is Mr. Lubitsch at his best after he has had experience with the microphone and now learned to manipulate it as he has done a camera for several years.It is a light musical comedy or operetta based on Hans Mueller's \\"The Blue Coast,\\" and written for the screen by Ernest Vajda. The principals are Jeanette MacDonald and Jack Buchanan, both of whom give a far better account of themselves than they have hitherto in film vehicles. It is an enjoyable, frothy diversion from beginning to end, a sophisticated entertainment in which Ernst Lubitsch's nimble mind is constantly apparent. Surprises come on the heels of every episode and it is evident that in supervising the adaptation, this German director has studied the whims of audiences. Film producers have lately been persuaded that singing pictures are amiss, but they had not witnessed this brilliant piece of work. For here the singing is pleasing and the humor is a combination of satire and sparkling fun.The story is as slender as most musical comedy affairs, but with Mr. Lubitsch at th helm, it turns out to be one of the most satisfying of audible pictures.Soon after a song and a chorus, Mr. Lubitsch shows a bride-to-be who has fled from her husband. She is sitting in the compartment of a train bound for the Riviera. Miss Mac-Donald as Countess Vera von Conti, who was to have been wed to Duke Otto von Seibenhein, sings as the train speeds on its way and the chugging of the locomotive, the sound of the wheels, the whistle and other noises serve as a partial accompaniment to the melody. It is a most effective stretch, one in which there is a true touch of genius.This particular episode is so good that one might presume before seeing the rest of the picture that the director could not live up to it, and that therefore the rest of the production would be rather tame. Such, however, is not the case, for while this singing on the train is the outstanding sequence, the others are so effervescent that they come as the port and liqueurs after a Continental meal.The Countess is down to her last 10,000 francs and she hopes by more or less judicious gambling at Monte Carlo to make a fortune such as a woman of her standing should possess. So soon after reaching her destination on the Riviera she, in most attractive raiment, goes to the Casino, and on the way, Count Rudolph Fallieres, played by Mr. Buchanan, espies her. He suggests to his friend, Armand, that he go up to the dazzling creature and address her. It is the Count's idea that he then enter upon the scene and slap the face of the impudent Armand. This, however, is forestalled by the Countess herself doing the slappling. So the Count is impelled to hasten after the Countess, and while following her he observes that she touches the back of a hunchback, who coolly asks for 50 francs for the good luck he may bring her.Fallieres then speaks to the Countess, who does not deign to turn around. He tells her that if she strokes the back of his head it will bring her good fortune at the tables. The Countess, ignoring him, enters the casino and the door closes in Fallieres's face. But a second later it opens and a little hand issues forth and strokes Fallieres's head.The plot of the story consists of having Fallieres pose as a hairdresser, who goes to the Countess just at the moment she has dismissed her coiffeur, Paul. Fallieres is employed and soon he appears in his hair-dressing garb, an overall on the pocket of which is the tonsorial insignia, an open pair of scissors with a comb between. At the behest of the Countess, Fallieres answers to the name of Paul, chiefly because her fiancé, the Duke, is also named Rudolph. No better servant than Fallieres could have been discovered by the Countess, for a stime goes on he waits on table, dresses her hair and also officiates as her chauffeur.Prior to this arrangement, Fallieres calls up the Countess on the telephone at night and sings to her. She will not listen, but one hears the song pouring out of the telephone. Finally the Countess is tempted to reply in song.There is the inevitable misunderstanding, but Fallieres always shows that he has a sense of humor. Then comes the night when the Countess goes to the opera, and the lines of the musical version of \\"Monsieur Beaucaire,\\" which is seen enacted on a stage, reveal to the Countess that Fallieres is no barber.Zasu Pitts does capital work as the Countess's doleful maid. Claude Allister appears to advantage as the addle-brained and strangely tolerant Duke. John Roche is excellent as the real hairdresser, Paul.Besides the songs in the reproduction of the act from the musical version of \\"Monsieur Beaucaire,\\" there are: \\"Beyond a Blue Horizon,\\" \\"Always in All Ways,\\" \\"Give Me a Moment, Please,\\" \\"She'll Love Me and Like It,\\" \\"Trimmin\\" the Women\\" and \\"A Job With a Future.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A Sparkling Comedy."},{"year":"1970","title":"SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.

She slops the coffee remains from several cups into one, sits at the littered table and sips the coffee while surveying the incredible kitchen mess. She doesn't anticipate the morning's chores with any pleasure, but she still can enjoy the momentary peace. Suddenly this peace is broken by the cry of the family's pet mynah bird who, though it can talk, always gets her name wrong. There's something very funny and touching and revealing about Antonietta's reaction. She's both annoyed with the bird and aware that to be furious with a bird a waste of her energies.

Congress has never granted any agency a blank check to spend taxpayer money in private-sector bailouts","excerpt":"a special law has financed each rescue. But in a strange twist to a reform movement intended to shield taxpayers, the House and Senate Banking Committees would change the rules so that taxpayers henceforth absorb some of the cost of rescuing commercial banks. Softened Senate Bill     The original bills were much tougher on taxpayers than the version that emerged on Friday from the Senate Banking Committee -- a version negotiated by Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, that preserves taxpayers' responsibility in principle, but in practice might drain away little public money. A consensus appears to be emerging in Congress for the mild Senate version. But whatever the actual language, the Fed and the White House have said in recent days that they will go along with a Congressional desire to recognize a taxpayer role.   The goal in Congress is to discipline the Fed, reflecting wide discontent with the Fed's practice of propping up failing banks. By forcing the Fed to draw on public funds when it lends to some weak banks, Congress hopes the central bank will become more reluctant to make loans from its \\"discount window\\" -- especially if they extend the life of a dying bank, adding to a bailout's cost.    \\"The Fed would be forced to think twice about making the no-brainer kinds of loans it is now making,\\" said Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.    The House and Senate panels would alter a practice that has existed since the 1930's: having the banking industry alone bear the cost of bailouts through premiums paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Fed, after lending money to banks that later collapsed, has always gone to the F.D.I.C. for reimbursement.    Now, the House Banking Committee, in a bill approved in June, and the Senate committee's milder provision, adopted on Friday, would require the Federal Reserve to justify lending to some banks in danger of failing and to draw on taxpayer funds if the loans exceeded certain limits set by Congress.    The Fed endorsed the tougher House version before the Senate acted on Friday. The Fed governors have not considered the Senate version, a spokesman said yesterday. A White House official yesterday praised the Senate version, mostly because the Senate dealt more to the White House's liking with the separate issue of rescuing big banks.   \\"We think 'too big to fail' rescues should be done, but only in extraordinary cases of risk to the economy,\\" said Robert R. Glauber, a Treasury under secretary. \\"The Senate bill provides the necessary hurdles.\\"    The American Bankers Association, representing the nation's 12,000 commercial banks, did not pick between House and Senate versions, but is lobbying for the principle that taxpayers, as well as the banking industry, must pay the cost of failures.   The association's support for a taxpayer role is understandable: Its insurance fund is nearly gone and the premiums paid by the nation's banks have tripled in recent years, to 23 cents for each $100 of deposits. Study of Practices     A House Banking Committee study, released in June, spotlighted the Fed's lending practices. The report found that over the last six years, the Fed had made loans to more than 300 banks that ultimately failed. The Fed has not challenged this. The resulting extra losses from extending the lives of dying banks were less than $2 billion over five years, said L. William Seidman, the F.D.I.C. chairman.    If Congress does, in fact, approve legislation that restricts Fed lending, the depositors most likely to be affected are those with uninsured funds -- more than $100,000 a depositor -- in a failing bank.    The Fed, by keeping a weak bank afloat, gives depositors time to transfer uninsured funds to healthy banks. If a weak bank was closed more quickly, people might not have time to do this.    Allowing deposits to migrate can make a bailout more costly. When the bank does fail or is merged, the F.D.I.C. has lost the opportunity to draw on uninsured deposits to help reimburse insured depositors or subsidize the merger.    \\"The principle on which most of the people in Congress are operating is to try to prevent us from covering depositors over $100,000,\\" Mr. Seidman said.  Limits on Lending     The House bill, in a key provison, limits to five days the period of time that the Federal Reserve can make loans to a bank whose capital, or available cash, falls below 2 percent of its outstanding loans. Any lending beyond five days would not be eligible for reimbursement. And the Fed could not collect collateral from the bank to assure F.D.I.C. reimbursement.   Instead, the money would have to come from the Fed's reserves. If it was lost, the Federal Reserve would have less to give the Treasury to help pay Government expenses, in effect putting more of a burden on taxpayers.    The House bill also permits the Treasury to rule whether a given bank's sudden failure would damage the financial system or a regional economy. Such a designation -- known as \\"too big to fail\\" -- would, when reported to Congress, enable the Fed to lend money to the bank to keep it going until a buyer could be found or the bank could be closed in some orderly fashion. The recent bailout of the Bank of New England is this sort of case. But under the House bill, the money would have to come from the Fed's pocket.  Compromise Is Accepted     The original Senate version would have imposed even tougher restrictions, requiring the Fed to lend from its own pocket to any \\"significantly undercapitalized\\" bank, whatever the period of time. But on Friday, the committee accepted a compromise pushed by Senator Gramm.    If a loan of, say, $10 million to an undercapitalized bank goes beyond the five-day limit or some other specified period, and the money is lost in a failure, the Fed would have to pay from its own pocket only the lost interest, say $400,000, but not the principal, as in the House version. The F.D.I.C. would repay the principal.   The Gramm compromise also changed the too-big-to-fail provision, requiring more public debate than the House version. Under the Senate provision, not only the Treasury, but also the President and five of the Fed's seven governors, must decide that a bank is too big to fail. Only then can the Treasury advance to the Fed the money to keep the bank temporarily alive. But the payout would not come from the taxpayers' pocket; the Treasury would eventually recover the outlay through a special assessment on commercial banks.  Champions of Restrictions     The Congressional goal of restricting the Fed is set forth most passionately by Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, and Senator Riegle. This camp argues that the Fed too frequently tries to prolong the lives of banks that are clearly doomed and, as Mr. Gonzalez puts it, is \\"cavalier\\" in failing to report its lending practices to Congress.    Still, Senator Riegle's committee accepted a compromise put forth on Friday by Senator Gramm that assigned most of the bailout expense to the F.D.I.C. while preserving the principle of Fed accountability.    \\"We never intended that the taxpayer should play a role; it is an unfortunate byproduct of an attempt to change the Fed's incentives,\\" said Patrick Lawler, chief economist for the Senate Banking Committee. \\"We think we now have something that deals with incentives, without putting any appreciable burden on the taxpayer.\\"   Although the Fed is not publicly fighting the Congressional effort, the restrictions run counter to the Fed's view of its role as an independent supplier of emergency funds.    \\"I don't know that we are jumping up and down with joy, but we can understand what they are trying to do and we can live with it,\\" John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor, said last week. \\"But my own view is that the lack of any discretionary flexibility is a mistake. One of the principal reasons for the Fed's existence is to provide emergency liquidity.\\" Taxpayer Role Sought In Bailing Out Banks"},{"year":"1972","title":"HARTFORD, Feb. 7 (AP) &#8212","excerpt":"A special legislative commission decided tonight to recommend passage of a modified form of no&#8208;fault auto insurance for personal injury.

This is assuming that you are a layperson (no pun intended -- well, you wouldn't get it anyway)","excerpt":"a specialist (a paleourologist, for example) might have some vague, academic notion. Sexual intercourse was the union of the male and female genitalia resulting (with often stunning rapidity) in the ejaculation of semen from the penis into the female reproductive tract. As a form of reproduction, it was a rudimentary method of achieving genetic variability. The fertilized egg, or zygote, possessing the normal diploid number of 46 chromosomes, represented a recombination of parental characteristics. I know, compared with your advanced life-fabricating technologies, all this must seem like so much Cro-Magnon finger painting. \\n\\n Yet even now as I write this, on the eve of the 21st century, reproductive intercourse is already considered an almost quaint pastime, the province primarily of nostalgia buffs and hobbyists, something akin to, say, needlepoint or canning preserves. Given recent advances in in-vitro fertilization, genetic engineering and cloning, it seems a distinctly primitive, ham-fisted approach to conception. It is, at the very least, a capricious method. We all know that the chances of two skanky teenagers conceiving a child in a random, one-time sexual encounter beneath a boardwalk following a night of correction-fluid huffing are infinitely greater than those of a married couple desperate for a family, who meticulously monitor ovulation and optimal fertilization windows down to the very minute of each cycle.

Morgenthau, for refusing to debate her on television. The commercial, which is running on Time Warner Cable stations, is called ''Don't Hold Your Breath''","excerpt":"a spokesman for her campaign declined to say how much it cost.    PRODUCER -- Jason McNaboe    ON THE SCREEN -- As tango music plays, New Yorkers puff out their cheeks as if holding their breath, in typical ''man on the street'' settings (strolling in front of a bus, driving a taxi, walking a dog, etc.). Ms. Snyder appears, gestures to a lectern with Mr. Morgenthau's name on it, and shakes her head. The ad ends with a shot of a baby with chubby cheeks.    THE SCRIPT -- A narrator with a Hispanic accent says: ''Manhattan is holding its breath, waiting for District Attorney Robert Morgenthau to debate. He's the D.A. who never tried a case in his life, and now he refuses to make his case to the voters. Will the D.A. who's been in office for 30 years debate? How long do we have to wait, Mr. Morgenthau?''      Ms. Snyder says: ''I'm ready to debate, any time, anywhere. But I'm not holding my breath.''     The narrator concludes, ''How long do we have to wait for a debate?''    ACCURACY -- Mr. Morgenthau has not agreed to participate in a televised debate. His spokesmen say that he debated Ms. Snyder twice earlier this year; her staff contends that those appearances were not debates and in any event were not televised. Mr. Morgenthau has never been a courtroom prosecutor, although he did successfully argue a case at the Court of Appeals. He has indeed been in office for three decades.    SCORECARD -- This humorous ad may soften Ms. Snyder's image, although she still seems plenty tough. But it is unclear how much voters care about debates as an issue. A televised debate would probably not show Mr. Morgenthau, who is 86 and hard of hearing, at his best, but incumbents often resist debates when races do not appear close, fearing that debates just lend stature to challengers.

Many of our modern-day sports have their roots in primitive societies' life and death situations of hunting, trapping, fleeing and surviving. Early ''civilized'' man often enjoyed blood and death more than sport (the Romans). The difference we ''civilized'' men claim today is that we have removed the death and maiming in sport, without destroying the struggle or excitement.

That's what this year has been for property insurers. Industry numbers show that through April catastrophe damage from severe spring weather, mainly in the nation's midsection, was $1.35 billion -- compared with just $550 million in the corresponding season last year.   Property-damage claims tend to be paid quickly, said Myron M. Picoult, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company, so this unsilent spring is going to hurt the industry's cash flow at a time when competition is restraining the premiums insurers can charge.

The good news is that the reflection is flattering, as this preview of photographs and drawings of the new spring clothes indicates. In the face of skyrocketing prices and political change, many top designers are producing many beautiful , wearable, feminine clothes that are intended to please - and to sell. While bold experimentation is far from dead, there is a hint of cautiousness - even conservatism - creeping in, leaving no doubt that at least several top designers are moving away from the provocative and sometimes bizarre designs of recent years.

Clarity Use a typewriter, a computer printer or handwritten block letters.  Limit the address to four or five lines.  ZIP Code To be read by the Postal Service's high-speed optical character machines the ZIP code should be on the last line of the address, after the state. An incorrect ZIP code, or the omission of one, will cause a delay.  Apartment Numbers The apartment number should immediately follow the street address on the same line. Absence of numbers is a big reason for nondelivery.

When he walked out to conduct Mahler's sprawling Sixth Symphony with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday night, he looked somber and bowed stiffly. Only once during the final ovations for this remarkable performance, Mr. Gatti's debut with the orchestra, did he break into a disarming smile: when the players, as a token of respect, remained seated and applauded him along with the audience.         The Mahler Sixth -- 90 minutes long and scored for a massive orchestra with a battery of percussion, including hammers, birch brush and offstage cow bells --  is a daunting piece for a Philharmonic debut. But this orchestra has a historic  claim to the work, having given the American premiere in 1947 under Dimitri Mitropoulos, whose 100th anniversary is being honored with these performances. Mr. Gatti, who conducted from memory, elicited radiant, incisive playing from the orchestra.

Dil had to be, among other things, poised, photogenic, black, extremely changeable and able to carry off the sleight-of-hand on which one of the film's secrets depends. In short, Dil had to be an actress with a difference.   Many people, Stanley Kubrick among them, warned Mr. Jordan he would never find the right performer for the part.

We display cartoons that are literary -- New Yorker cartoons, for example, are so witty and urbane and sophisticated.\\n\\n\\"There are also 3-D objects and videos -- we never lost track of the fact that cartooning is a fun, popular art form. But I think what they have in mind for the new museum is something more state of the art, involving robotics and computers, something rather futuristic.\\"\\n\\nThe museum is run by an 18-member board of directors, which includes several cartoonists, and a seven-member staff. The staff has been invited to move with the museum, but no one has yet made a decision.\\n\\nBarbara Hammond, the museum's director, said: \\"At this museum, we demand that you look at a piece of work, think about it, try to get the brain working. There is a trend in museums today, however, for people to get more heavily involved with an exhibit faster.

But the maintenance burden has been considerable since the museum moved in in 1977.\\n\\n\\"You're trying to run a cartoon museum and you're working in the field of historic preservation,\\" she said.\\n\\nMs. Hammond, a former assistant director at Lyndhurst, the National Trust property in Tarrytown, said change was nothing new to the Museum of Cartoon Art. Founded in 1971 by members of the National Cartoonists Society, it opened in 1974 in the Mead mansion in Greenwich.

In 1977, with another grant from the Hearst Foundation and money from the State Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Ward's Castle was bought.\\n\\nAttendance grew and is now 28,000 annually. The permanent exhibitions begin with Daumier prints, include a rare \\"Hogan's Alley\\" panel of art -- which first appeared in 1895 in The New York World and is credited with being the first newspaper comic strip -- and run through the present. Special exhibitions have featured Bugs Bunny, Batman, Dick Tracy and other popular cartoon and comic characters. \\n\\nAs its popularity grew, so did talk of moving to larger quarters. Current capacity is 250 visitors, Ms. Hammond said, a number that is pushed to its limits during certain shows. Several years ago, there were discussions of moving to the old Town Hall in Stamford. Last year, negotiations were undertaken with the Maritime Center in Norwalk, for use of a converted warehouse. Spots in Manhattan, Boston and Washington have also been considered.\\nPalm Beach Calling \\n\\n Those plans fell through, but a cartoon collector in Palm Beach heard about the relocation efforts. \\"Palm Beach County was looking to improve tourism, to attract art and cultural institutions,\\" Ms. Hammond explained. A parcel of land in Palm Beach Gardens was offered. \\"Then the people in Boca Raton heard about that possible deal, and they contacted us with their offer of a free acre in Mizner Park,\\" she said.\\n\\nMr. Walker said, \\"It was such a nice thing for someone to call us and say come on down.\\" The open-air esplanade and mall has \\"six restaurants, an eight-screen movie theater, shops, apartments and is right on Route 1,\\" he added. Ten acres had been set aside for cultural development; an amphitheater will occupy nine of those acres and the World Museum of Cartoon Art, as it is to be known, the other acre.\\n\\nWhat remains to be done is to raise $3 million to $4 million, Mr. Walker said, for the construction of the building. A project director, Daryl Glenney, has been hired in Boca Raton.\\nOne Castle for Sale \\n\\n The museum board of directors, which last month voted 13 to 3 in favor of the move, is planning various fund-raising events and appeals. And Ward's Castle has been put on the market for $1.6 million. \\"If we can get the money, we can have the building in Florida up in 90 days,\\" Mr. Walker said. \\n\\nCounty Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said he was disappointed with the vote. \\"We tried,\\" he said.  \\"We told them we'd love to keep them here. But we never got to the stage of talking about alternatives because they were already pretty well committed to the Florida location.

Prices are current. The American Festival Cafe     20 West 50th Street (212) 246-6699 -- With the rink at Rockefeller Center open, this sparkling, glass-enclosed restaurant right on ice level is a delightful spot for children. Tables are spacious and the Spanish-style leather chairs commodious. The young staff has more patience with children than do most servers in the city.    During the holiday season the cafe offers breakfast with Santa from 7:30 to 9:45 A.M. (reservations are necessary). Santa visits each table, chats with children and gives them little presents. Breakfast is $15.95 for children and adults. It includes a basket of muffins and cookies, a pitcher of freshly squeezed orange juice and a choice of eggs, pancakes, French toast or crepes with blueberry-and-apple sauce. Sausages and bacon is served family style. Desserts include apple pie, fruit salad or stollen.     The price includes a free skating session on the Rockefeller Plaza rink. There are two sessions, from 8:30 to 10 A.M., and from 10:30 to noon. (Skate rental is not included.)

This is an enjoyable place for children, with its action-packed ambiance, friendly and gregarious service, and familiar (though uneven) food. To the average wide-eyed 10-year-old, Mickey Mantle is probably some vague Hall of Fame icon, as remote as Ty Cobb. But that's not important, for the delicious scents of cowhide and freshly mowed outfields clings to this place, and the effect on children is magical.   The contemporary and informal space, with a big bar up front overlooking Central Park South, is filled with sports memorabilia, including uniforms of Mantle, Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio, autographed photos, paintings, posters and even nonstop videos of old World Series film and interviews with Mantle.

Hamburger Harry's     145 West 45th Street (212) 840-0566 and 157 Chambers Street (212) 267-4446 -- This sleek restaurant's two locations, near Times Square and downtown, have violet walls, neon highlights, blond wood tables and open charcoal-mesquite grills. From the main menu, children can attack thick hamburgers made with good semi-lean ground beef and served on sesame seed buns. You can get everything from the \\"naked burger\\" (without a roll) to a caviar and sour cream burger, to the \\"ha ha burger\\" (chili, cheddar cheese, chopped onion, guacamole and hot sauce). The cole slaw is fresh and tasty, although french fries are sometimes soggy.    There is also a children's menu with a foot-long hot dog, pizza English muffins and tuna boat on a roll. For dessert there is a heaping hot fudge sundae served in a plastic baseball hat. Hamburger Harry's also has crayons on the tables and placemats that double as a coloring book.

There is also an appealing little selection of grilled fish, meat and vegetables.    Appetizers range from $3.50 to $7.50; main courses from $6 to $17.50. Sunday hours are 11 A.M. to midnight.

Verdi's libretto by Antonio Somma was based on the assassination of a Swedish king at a masked ball in the Stockholm opera house in 1792. But the censors in Naples in 1857 objected to setting it too close to home in either space or time. So Somma thought of moving it to Pomerania (\\"an independent duchy in the 12th century\\"). Verdi finally settled on Boston, renaming the characters (although in Paris, an early production moved the setting to Italy). So the opera ended up with villains named Samuel and Tom, along with alternative names for the king (Gustav III or Riccardo) and the king's best friend (Captain Anckarstrom or Renato).   In the current production by Piero Faggioni, which was presented for the first time this season on Tuesday night, the setting is nominally Sweden, with all the Swedish names used. But the setting less resembles Sweden than a fictional landscape all the Met's own -- a designed universe of historical spectacle, where the attraction is less the singing and the personalities than the elaborate physical constructions surrounding them.

It could also have been improved if one of the male characters were stronger and more likable. Had this Matt Wilde been less of a comedian and more of a hero, the picture would be far more satisfactory, especially in the ending.Bebe Daniels does fairly well with her part even if she is a little unimaginative and rather artificial in some of the scenes. She impersonates Peggy Lawrence, an extremely lucky telephone operator. The instant opportunity knocks on her door, she is ready to take advantage of it. Matt Wilde, a comedian, knowing that Peggy is very keen to become an actress, gives her a trial at a Bowery amateur night. The audience is by no means enthusiastic over Peggy's talent, but William Laidlaw, a young man of ample means, decides that Peggy shows promise. His prediction comes true, and Peggy eventually makes a hit on Broadway. This brings her in contact with Laidlaw and his pretty wife, played by Helen Lee Worthing.After war is declared there is a scene in which the late President Woodrow Wilson is seen marching along Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. Then there are many other glimpses of the war-torn front, with flammenwerfer, crashing airplanes, fifteen-inch guns and muddy men just relieved from the trenches. All these touches of the fighting as it actually occurred in 1918 fit in nicely with the scenes filmed in Astoria in 1925.The eagerness of some men to get into the army and the eagerness of others to keep out of it is sketched vividly. Laidlaw's young brother Norman is one of the first to go, and William still is a civilian when he reads of Norman's death, which tragic happening prompts him to join up. Grace Laidlaw's insistence on her husband becoming a fighter is misunderstood by Peggy, who believes that Grace only wants to get rid of her husband. In the film there does not seem much reason for this belief.Peggy, of course, goes to France as a \\"Y\\" worker, where, through one of those coincidences which must take place in a motion picture, she encounters Laidlaw. She and others one night entertain a group of fighters, the performance being suddenly interrupted by an air raid, and the soldiers are ordered into cellars of other buildings. Laidlaw volunteers to save a munition dump from falling into the enemy's hands. Peggy, fearful lest Laidlaw be killed, risks her life by going to a signal station, only thinking of Laidlaw. The telephone operator has been wounded. Peggy, an old hand at a switchboard, gets an open wire, after having heard that a battalion of men must be warned of an attack. First she thinks of helping Laidlaw, but in the end she sends a message that saves the thousand men.Peggy is wounded, and the woman who nurses her is Grace Laidlaw. It is while she is suffering from temporary blindness that Peggy becomes convinced that Mrs. Laidlaw really loves her husband.Miss Worthing is charming as Grace Laidlaw. She occasionally displays a little uncertainty of action, and is a trifle too docile in some of the argumentative situations, being apparently afraid to disturb the equanimity of her attractive countenance. T. Roy Barnes is too much the comedian in the rôle of Matt Wilde. As William Laidlaw, Kenneth Harlan is earnest and satisfactory.

African films remain largely untouched by the conventions of international film making, and that purity accounts for much of their magic.         Since African work seldom finds distribution here, this series is especially  valuable for offering a wide array of recent films.

Nevertheless, the impression is conveyed that Louis Neville, the hero artist, played by Conway Tearle, is painting on his canvas what he sees on the little round pedestal.This model, aside from any inquisitiveness, has a beautiful pair of eyes and lips that would pass muster in many a crowd of pretty girls, and the fact is not supposed to go wholly unobserved by Neville in subsequent posings of the fair one. His heart obviously flutters in Valerie West's favor.New York, where the action takes place, is characterized as a modern Babylon and \\"The New Paris.\\" One sees a fully graduated model complaining that she is no mermaid and that the water in which she is posing is no sun-kissed pool. She requests the artist, therefore, to \\"have a heart.\\"When Valerie, hungry and tired, presents herself at Neville's studio, she is asked whether she poses in the draped or undraped figure, and she replies that she expects to do what is required of models. Neville is very business-like about his painting, until one day it dawns on him that Valerie is unusually pretty. And what helps this impression is that Corinne Griffith is pretty. We might have mentioned a perfect little nose when allusion was made to her eyes and her lips.Here and there this production is little coarse, and in a storm scene, in which Valerie is drenched by a motion-picture rain and blown about by a stiff breeze produced by an airplane propeller, it is evident that the director wished the spectators to have a fair idea of the girl's figure.Everybody in this production has his telephone painted a French gray, and the implement is usually carefully concealed behind a tiny screen. Neville, anxious about Valerie because he has not seen her for days and days—she having promised his sister to keep away from the artist—calls up the model, who is asleep. Another girl awakens her and Valerie takes up the receiver and, after a word or two with Neville, yawns delightfully, eliciting a wondering grimace on the artist's countenance and a question. She explains that she is not ill, merely sleepy.Harry Myers has the part of the despicable villain. It is he who is soundly lashed with a whip by Valerie, whom he has attempted, to kiss. Myers happens to be a sympathetic actor, and even in this sequence one feels almost sorry that he was flung into the heavy's part.The settings in this production are pleasing, especially the studio scenes. The photography also is quite artistic in some sequences.Corinne Griffith has a very pleasing personality on the screen, and she sincerely attempts to look as if she were interested in the narrative. Conway Tearle is better in modern attire than he was in \\"Ashes of Vengeance.\\" But he poses too much, and a lifted eyebrow is supposed to denote wonder, surprise, vexation and also disappointment. Elliott Dexter plays José Querida; he is quite capable, but a little more thought given to the situations might have improved matters. This picture has the advantage of being entertaining and is far better than the more pretentious offerings of the same producing concern.

For the melodrama, which began a week's stand at the Palace yesterday, does not resort to common flim-flam, excessive fireworks or hide a fact from the moment its title is flashed on the screen to its climax.What it sets out to prove—the titular thesis that its leading man is a gent doomed to defeat—it does conclusively. But, since it is perfectly lucid, the picture, in the main, is robbed of suspense, leaving little else but a workmanlike story depicted fairly professionally if not with great verve or speed.Producer Jack M. Warner, who obviously has come by his calling naturally as the son of Jack L. Warner of the noted Warner Brothers, herein makes a decent start as an independent film maker. Seton I. Miller and Philip MacDonald have presented him with a respectable yarn about a detective lieutenant, an expert in his line and a citizen with an eye for a lady who accidentally kills her estranged husband and asks her cop-admirer to cover up her deed. Despite his good record and a gnawing conscience, our man erases evidences of the crime but his brother, recently promoted from a beat to the homicide squad, is suspicious enough to keep the case going and finally break it.Although the proceedings are moderately paced, Director Felix E. Feist has gotten some brisk passages into the goings-on, and since he has chosen to shoot his story in San Francisco, the character and charm of the city, the Golden Gate and bridge have been captured on film. Count as the location highlight of the production, the final scene in Fort Point, a windswept, abandoned fortress hard by the bridge, which serves as an unusual locale for the film's climactic chase.As the wily detective who is snared into forsaking his career by a designing female, Lee J. Cobb effects a solid and restrained performance. As his romantic vis-a-vis, Jane Wyatt is slightly improbable and less than restrained, and John Dall is serious but callow as Cobb's brother.

Laurent Hilaire, a guest star from the Paris Opera Ballet, made a role debut in the afternoon as Solor, the noble warrior who loves the temple dancer Nikiya but must marry Gamzatti, the Rajah's beautiful but murderous daughter. Most American ballet dancers could profitably study Mr. Hilaire's bold, clear mime. But this was a slightly remote Solor. Mr. Hilaire's propulsive, stylish jumps and turns, particularly in the Kingdom of the Shades scene, established the character's nobility and the performer's appetite for dancing, though an occasional landing plie would have been welcome.    Christina Fagundes brought compelling technical skills, true and clear, to Gamzatti in the afternoon's other role debut. But this was an almost unrelievedly villainous woman, and without a sense of Gamzatti's softer side the character is less believable and less dramatically useful. Cheryl Yeager, who recently took on the role, offered the same kind of unshaded characterization in the evening, although her Gamzatti seemed at first, imaginatively, a timid child. Ms. Yeager's pulled-up, airy carriage and attack gave Gamzatti a lyrical grandeur, however, in the garden scene.

Tonight an exceptional example can be found, at 10 on ABC , in a \\"Thirtysomething\\" episode written and directed by Richard Kramer, one of the producers.   Created by Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, \\"Thirtysome thing\\" prides itself on being a character show, not a subject show. No disease-of-the-week pontifications for this gang, though considerable mileage was registered on the successful battle by Nancy (Patricia Wettig) against ovarian cancer. Each episode of \\"Thirtysomething\\" is constructed around a theme, usually with one relationship offering a mirror image of another.

The company's architectural trademark is a flat-roofed, single-story structure with bright orange doors, and until now no community besides Beverly Hills has objected. But to gain acceptance in Norwalk, Public Storage had to hire Bruce Beinfeld, a Norwalk architect, and design a red-brick building with pointed towers, much like many other structures in the city.   Approval was granted in December after review by the city's Zoning Commission, Conservation Commission, Redevelopment Authority and Buildings Department. The site of the 100,000-square-foot building, with 200 storage units, will be at Hoyt Street and Route 1, where Public Storage now is demolishing a 70-year-old factory that it bought for $2.3 million from the R.

British police officers investigating the theft of ''Reclining Figure,'' right, a two-ton Henry Moore sculpture valued at $5.2 million, from the artist's estate 30 miles north of London have recovered the flatbed truck and crane believed to have been used in the crime, but they expressed fear that the bronze might be melted for scrap, The Associated Press and the BBC reported. Chief Inspector Richard Harbon of the Hertfordshire police characterized the sculpture as ''a national treasure'' that would be ''very, very difficult to get rid of.'' He said, ''So, obviously, we are looking at all the possibilities, right from scrap metal up to fine arts theft.'' Created in 1969-70, the statue by Moore (1898-1986), one of the pre-eminent sculptors of the 20th century, was stolen on Thursday night from Perry Green, the 70-acre estate and studios that he established, endowed and left to his foundation. The thieves, two vehicles and the crane were seen on closed-circuit television.    Wyeth's 'Helga' Art Is Sold       The 240-piece ''Helga'' collection of art by Andrew Wyeth, which caused a sensation when its existence was revealed in 1986, has been sold and is no longer in the custody of the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford, Pa., The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Created from 1971 to 1985, the paintings, watercolors and pencil studies, some of them nudes, used as a model Helga Testorf, a Wyeth neighbor in Chadds Ford, and were unknown even to Mr. Wyeth's wife, Betsy. In 1986, Wyeth, now 88, sold the art to Leonard E. B. Andrews, a Pennsylvania businessman and art collector, who resold it to an anonymous Japanese collector in 1989 for $40 million to $45 million. The collection was entrusted to the Brandywine River Museum, home to a collection of art by three generations of Wyeths. The latest sale was handled by Ann Richards Nitze, a Washington dealer, who declined to identify the buyer or specify the price, The Inquirer said.

Sting was smart to return to mid-size theaters like the 5,605-seat Paramount for his current tour (although he's also opening some stadium shows for the Grateful Dead), because the music he's making now moves too fast and too subtly for most arena concerts. He writes and sings pop songs, but in concert they're laced with jazzy improvisation, transforming them between the lines of catchy choruses and rolling grooves. For all of Sting's associations with causes, and the earnest moping of many of his lyrics, he has rarely been a preachy performer in concert. And on Tuesday, Sting the musician was triumphant.   While Sting's bands, including the Police, have never been content to play songs by rote, his current group takes on all challenges, from odd meters and harmonic substitutions to the openness and understatement of a ballad. Sting's own bass was both foundation and fulcrum for a nimble four-piece band including Dominic Miller on guitar, David Sancious on keyboards and Vinnie Colaiuta on drums.

Della Femina in East Hampton, a brainchild of Jerry Della Femina, the advertising executive, and Drew Nieporent of Montrachet and the TriBeCa Grill in Manhattan, is a reality. It is also an instant hit.    Della Femina is filled with the famous and near-famous, the summer people and Hamptons perennials. The scene is one of nonstop table hopping, hugs, waves and kisses.    Diners unimpressed by celebrity spotting will find even more substantial rewards in the splendid food, speedy service and handsome surroundings.    Della Femina is a beauty. The pale carpeting, pastel-sponged walls and light wood create a subtle backdrop. Giant sunflowers fill a huge fireplace, mirroring the black-eyed Susans of the outdoor window boxes. Pottery, along with wall sconces that resemble bundles of reeds, are the focal point.    The bar boasts terra cotta floors, a skylight ceiling and walls covered with caricatures of notable Hamptonites. On a slow night for celebrity watching, diners can try their hand at identifying the drawings. Billy Joel, Pierre Franey, Martha Stewart and, of course, Mr. Della Femina and his wife, Judy Licht, are among them.    Assembling a service staff in late August, when most of the summer help heads back to college, was probably no easy task. But the crew, while not perfect, is above average. The delivery of dishes is prompt, and everything from replacing silver to pouring wine is done with style.    There is, however, one service shortfall. Diners are never offered a second roll. It is a shame, because the sturdy beauties taste like more. They were accompanied by a garlicky white-bean spread on one evening, pesto on another.   Four salads grace the menu. The well-dressed arugula is encircled with balls of nicely seasoned mozzarella and topped with an intensely flavored home-dried tomato. The field-greens salad is everything it should be. The Caesar has a plate of whole romaine leaves, slices of Parmesan and large, crunchy croutons. Tastiest is an endive-and-watercress salad sparked with bacon and Roquefort cheese, but red oak leaf lettuce and radicchio outnumbered the advertised greens.    A grilled portobello mushroom atop a bed of frisee is another salad-style starter. The size of the mushroom varies. We received a midget, but saw giants going to other tables. A cooling gazpacho with deep tomato flavor, garnished with a confetti of chopped vegetables and a swirl of flavored oil was another fine opener.    Pastas are available as appetizers in half portions. An earthy penne puttanesca and rigatoni tossed with olive oil, crushed sausage and shards of Savoy cabbage are among the tantalizing possibilities.    There were two strikeouts, though, among the winning lineup of entrees. Barbecued duck was tough with flabby skin, and the vegetable platter was uninspired. Its centerpiece, a red pepper filled with a too-sweet caponata, was surrounded by overly dry grilled vegetables in need of a splash of oil.    In the winning column were soft-shell crabs enlivened with pancetta and capers, perched on a tasty salad","excerpt":"a succulent fork-tender veal chop; flaky grilled swordfish over succotash, a roasted chicken breast zingy with lemon and mated with yummy polenta and rare grilled tuna served warm atop sliced local tomatoes.    Most of the desserts are right on target. A melange of summer fruits under a browned zabaglione led the hits. Other stellar performers were a burnt-sugar almond cake studded with berries and a cold berry soup teamed with a deep-fried ravioli oozing melted chocolate.    But the warm chocolate cake paired with ice cream was served steaming hot, resulting in an instant ice-cream meltdown. A blood-orange-and-blackberry puff-pastry tart sounded appealing, but was slightly burned and nothing special.   About half the 35 table wines at Della Femina are French. Most of the rest are from Italy and the West Coast. There are two Long Island selections. Four bottles are priced less than $20.

It would be a mistake for you to try to brush their worries aside.  It would be far better to acknowledge the real threat to the Western alliance.   Your aim should be to persuade these nations that you are facing up to the gravity of the crisis and intend to work with them to solve it. You should accept the principle of subjecting all national economic policies to greater scrutiny by members of the alliance. You may argue that the United States is not solely to blame, and that the problems are not simply a result of the recession but lie much deeper.

Although \\"Destroy, She Said\\" avoids most of the vulgar conventional ties to place and character, and although it says very little once that it does not also say twice, it gives the impression finally of precision, eloquence and considerable wit.The setting, which might do for a low-budget remake of \\"Last Year at Marienbad,\\" is a building and its grounds — meant to represent a hotel, surrounded by a park, surrounded by a forest. Except for tables and chairs and necessary lights, the building is empty inside and out. You can hear a tennis game being played, but you never see it. The hotel is known for its view, but when one of the men looks for the view he can't find it. The woman are afraid of the forest.We see only four guests at the hotel. Elisabeth Alione is a woman in her thirties presumably recovering from an unsuccessful childbirth. Max Thor, a professor, is attracted to her. His young wife, Alissa, is attracted to Stein, who sleeps on the hotel grounds and watches through an open window while Thor and Alissa make love each night.Thor teaches the history of the future, about which he finds nothing to say, so he says nothing, and his students sleep a lot. Alissa was once his student. Both Thor and Stein are \\"about to become\\" writers, a professional status that the movie accepts without comment.I find that I also accept a good deal, not only in the film's genuinely brilliant scenes (a phony card game in which Elisabeth is entrapped by the others","excerpt":"a superbly poised mirror scene in which Elisabeth and Alissa more or less exchange personalities) but in its many less than brilliantly stylized dialogues and indirect confrontations.The movies made from Miss Duras's novels, even \\"Hiroshima, Mon Amour,\\" have in large measure depended upon an evocation of mood, a sense of dense and strange beauty foreign to the lucidity and simplicity of her own directorial decisions. She apparently means her film to portend revolution, holocaust, and rebirth (thus, the film's title), but she maintains her own sense of order and decorum to the end.It must take a good deal to sustain dialogue composed chiefly of non sequiturs. Miss Duras's cast manages it with style. I have reservations about Michel Lonsdale (the unlovable shoestore owner in Truffaut's \\"Stolen Kisses\\"), who brings too weighty a personality to the abstractions of his role, but the other actors suggest just enough meaning to maintain conversation without overloading it.Both women are called upon generally to act as if in a state of nervous anxiety. Nicole Hiss, as Alissa, varies that expression with one of equally nervous hopeful expectation. So far as I can tell from the part, she seems an actress of considerable skill and presence.\\"Destroy, She Said,\\" which played at the New York Film Festival last night, will be shown again in Alice Tully Hall on Sunday at 1 P.M.

But late last month, Mr. Thomas convened a more public gathering of 35 African-Americans, including some from the black press, for three hours of off-the-record meetings at the Supreme Court. The guests were plucked from the Rolodex of the Washington talk-show host Armstrong Williams, one of Justice Thomas's closest friends.

Ten years ago, Mr. Brady suffered permanent brain damage when John W. Hinckley Jr. tried to assassinate Mr. Reagan. The former President, a member of the National Rifle Association, has endorsed waiting periods before, always insisting, however, that the matter be left to the states. By endorsing the Federal Brady bill, he caused the political ground to shift. \\"It's sort of like Nixon going to China,\\" said Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat.   Opponents of the bill dismissed the impact of Mr. Reagan's blessing. \\"He's no longer a kinetic force in American politics,\\" said John Michael Snyder, public affairs director for The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. The gun lobby continued to hawk an alternative bill that would require the Federal Government to establish within six months of passage a national computerized system to instantaneously check the background of prospective handgun buyers. Brady bill proponents say such a system would take years to implement. Headliners","excerpt":"A Surprise From Reagan for the N.R.A."},{"year":"1964","title":"SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.

Lovers in all their profusion Seek amore, amour or amor, Choose from the standard selection, And fold their hearts in the mail. -- LEWIS GARDNER DEAR Diary:    Receiving mail used to be fun back when people wrote letters. But who writes letters now? Certainly not the folks who send me bills, solicitations and catalogues. Especially catalogues. These arrive with such annoying frequency that last year I determined to keep count. This is how it went in 1990.    The total for the year was 173 catalogues from 55 companies. J. Crew sent the most (15)","excerpt":"a surprise second was Tiffany & Company (10). Eddie Bauer sent 6; L. L. Bean and Land's End were tied with 4 each.    The numerous garden catalogues were pretty, as well as pretty surprising, considering the fact that my Brooklyn garden consists of two 6-by-24-inch window boxes. Food was a popular subject (8 catalogues), the most unusual being Sunny Farms, which is devoted exclusively to pecans. Underwear is also a mail-order favorite.   Both International Male (7) and Undergear (8) advertised exotic underwear for men (leopard thongs) while Victoria's Secret had exotic attire for women (red lacy thongs). And winter silk undies were everywhere.    Brooks Brothers (10) was the most boring, Paul Stuart (2) the handsomest and most difficult to read. (Descriptions and prices were on separate pages in the back.)   My favorite, by far, was the Chicken Boy Catalogue for a Perfect World. My favorite items from it: the \\"environmentally correct\\" toilet paper cozy \\"inspired by Coco Chanel\\" and the combination \\"lava lite and small pet fez.\\" The latter comes with an elastic strap because, the description reads, \\"even though every living thing looks great in a fez, we know that sometimes pets aren't convinced.\\"   That particular catalogue is, naturally, from California. If all catalogues had such insight, going to the mail box might be fun again. -- ED FRANTZ   Overheard on the downtown Seventh Avenue subway one recent Monday evening, one woman to another.   Woman one: Want to go to a movie tonight?   Woman two: Nah. I'm going to watch TV.   Woman one: So what's on that's so good?   Woman two: Mother Theresa at 9, Cher at 10.     The place is an office building elevator, Madison Avenue in the East 50's.    The elevator is heading up to the tower offices of several prestigious law and investment firms. The cast of characters includes a half-dozen or so well-dressed, end-of-the-day-frazzled business types; a woman pushing a large comfortable-looking stroller containing an unseen infant, and Joan Rosenfelt who overhears the ensuing conversation.   First man, sweetly, in little voice to unseen infant: Hello, are we disturbing you? Are we disturbing you?    Business woman: Gee, I wish I could lie in a carriage and be wheeled around all day.    Second man: Me, too.   Third man: Those were the days!   Fourth man, addressing baby: Enjoy it while you can, kid. It doesn't last long.    General laughter and agreement as elevator stops and woman with carriage exits, along with several others.   Last man: Funny how we spend the first half longing to get out and the second half longing to go back, huh?    Last woman, wistfully: So true, so true.   The elevator arrives at the top. Last man and last woman exit, wish each other well, head in opposite carpeted, mahogany-doored, book-lined directions.  Dear Diary:   I recently bought a kitchen table and four chairs from the Door Store. At the time of my purchase I was told that the table would be delivered unassembled, which it was.   It arrived as a table top, 4 table legs, 8 nuts, 8 cut washers and 8 smooth washers. I phoned the store to inquire in which order the washers were to be placed on the screws on the table legs. This was the conversation that followed:    Woman: Hello, Door Store.   Customer: Yes, I need to speak to a salesman.   Woman: SALESPERSON.   Customer: O.K., a salesperson.   Woman: How can I help you?   Customer: Well, I just had a table delivered and I need to know which order the washers go into the screws on the table legs.   Woman: What? Washers? Hold on.   Male voice: Can I help you?   So much for feminist rhetoric. -- LIZ WILSON Dear Diary:   My husband and I, relatively distinguished-looking advertising and publishing executives and Connecticut commuters, were walking across Grand Central Terminal one recent morning when a middle-aged man -- unshaven, sad-looking -- walked determinedly in our direction. We braced ourselves for his expected plea for change, cash, help of some kind.   As he reached us, the man looked in my husband's eyes and in a low matter-of-fact voice uttered four words. \\"You're losing your hair,\\" he said.

Wolpe, a former left-wing activist in Weimar Germany as well as an early devotee of Schoenberg's 12-tone method, told the resolutely apolitical Feldman to compose more for ordinary people. \\"Write for the man in the street!\\" he cried, pointing out the window. The man in the street at that moment was Jackson Pollock.         The moral is that composers who begin writing for the man in the street often end up writing for an elite audience of colleagues and friends. Feldman's malicious little story ran through my mind on Saturday night during a concert by the Continuum ensemble in the Miller Theater at Columbia University. It was a survey of political activism in 20th-century music: \\"A Just New World Is in Creation\\" by Wolpe, along with Ruth Crawford's \\"Sacco, Vanzetti,\\" Aaron Copland's \\"Into the Streets May First,\\" Frederic Rzewski's \\"Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues\\" and many other earnest efforts.

In \\"Lady Tubbs,\\" the new Universal film at the Roxy, she comes through handsomely with a performance that at once justifies the picture's inclusion in any list of the season's best comedies.Homer Croy's story of Mom Tubbs, the cook in the railroad construction camp who inherits a fortune, assumes a title and surges into Long Island's smart set to adjust the romance between her niece and the son of the snobbish Ash-Orcutts, has been screened with a shrewd sense of filmic pace, a bright eye for every comic opportunity and, withal, the pleasant quality of being believable. This last is all the more welcome considering the number of recent photoplays that have begun as comedies, dropped into farce and wound up as sorry burlesque.But Mom Tubbs, as Miss Brady plays her, is authentic. Being a \\"robustious\\" sort of person as camp cook for a hard-drinking crew of construction men, she does not emerge in her \\"Lady\\" Tubbs disguise either as a bona fide to-the-manner-born aristocrat or—and this is the cinema's more common error—as a hopelessly farcical social error.Schooled by the London solicitor, Wembsleigh, who brings her news of her $500,000 inheritance, the Tubbs's descent upon Long Island is deferred until she has done a bit of foreign traveling and has acquired a system of meeting conversational problems. As she explains to her niece (with appropriate eyebrow raising and a flutter of the hands), one merely says of a woman, \\"She's too sweet,\\" of a man, \\"He's too marvelous,\\" of an event, \\"Oh, it's too amazing\\" and, of items beyond these classifications, \\"Too, too divine.\\"The system is flawless until a fox hunt is arranged for the visiting English noblewoman. \\"Too, too divine\\" does not prevent the Tubbs from being mounted on a stallion called Lightning and riding off in a shower of \\"Yoicks!\\" to one of the funniest scenes to reach a Broadway screen in many a moon. Mom Tubbs's eventual conquest of society, her successful match-making for the niece and her own ultimate acquirement of an authentic title are more than mere story embellishments in this case: they are the just due of a grand character.In saluting the cast, one should not overlook Alan Mowbray's splendid performance as Wembsleigh, Hedda Hopper's portrayal of Mrs. Ash-Orcutt and Lumsden Hare's Lord Abernathy. Douglass Montgomery, Anita Louise and June Clayworth are helpful, too.On the stage is a Columbia Broadcasting System \\"all-star revue,\\" featuring Tito Guizar, Mary Eastman, Harry Von Zell, Swor and Lubin, Emery Deutsch and, inevitably, the Roxy's own Gae Foster Girls.

It is based on a story by Ida A. R. Wylie and was directed by the indomitable Frank Lloyd, who, although he has several worthy screen productions to his credit, has often found his productions either cursed by a bewildering profusion of characters or by the banality of the narratives.This new film makes no pretensions concerning action or length, but it moves along with an appealing naturalness, just like a breath of life. It carries with it a tear or two and an occasional smile. It is almost Barriesque in its idea and the mere fact that the producers have not sought to encumber it with glittering cabaret scenes, bright-eyed blondes or artificial villains enhances its value as a rational and pleasing entertainment.It is without a doubt a yarn that is better suited to Mr. Barthelmess than anything in which he has appeared since \\"Tol'able David.\\" And he is ably supported by the winsome Miss Nixon, who delivers her lines with careful thought.At first, when the opening scene strikes the screen, one is impelled to shudder at the thought that it is going to be another crook story, for there is the magistrate and at least one person who is under arrest. But soon one is calmed by a flashback which gives a careful delineation of the character of Albert Whalen, the \\"Young Nowheres\\" of the yarn. He is an elevator operator in the hotel. He is unable to seize an opportunity to improve his position, but he does succeed in attracting the attention of the humble Annie Jackson, who considers herself fortunate in being hired to clean one of the hotel apartments.The charge against Whalen is that of forcing an entrance into Mr. Cleaver's apartment and occupying it. The flashback testimony tells how Annie Jackson and Whalen came to be in Cleaver's apartment. There are no heroics, just a simple tale of love, hardships, and then a few moments of happiness on Christmas Eve.It is no dream, just a plain recital and Mr. Barthelmess and Miss Nixon compel attention every instant. And at the end, when in the average motion picture the villain would have had a chapter to himself, the affair is settled in a sympathetic and plausible manner. It is quite plain that no man would be flint-hearted enough to insist upon pressing the charge against Whalen, and therefore Mr. Cleaver proves himself to be quite human after all.In the course of this picture, Bert Roach gives a capital conception of a good-natured individual who has looked upon the wine when it was red. His uncertain speech and heavy head are certain to arouse laughter whenever this film is shown.

But overall it was a happy and provocative evening.    The company was founded in 1986 by Brenda Bufalino, a veteran tapper. It functions like a symphony orchestra, with the dancers performing as an ensemble. The tone is set with an opening number called \\"Strike Up . . . the A Train,\\" choreographed by Ms. Bufalino. Drawn together in a loose cluster, the dancers eventually peel out into a single long line across the stage to tap as a group to the Billy Strayhorn song of the title, performed by an onstage jazz ensemble.

Every time the Lebanese component of the crisis is resolved, Syria's and Israel's intransigence and intervention plunge the country into chaos. The Israelis will not withdraw from the south, arguing that pro-Syrian Palestinian and Shiite guerrillas strive to attack northern Israel. The Syrians have broader goals in Lebanon, like Saddam Hussein's ambition over Kuwait, and entrench their hold.   So-called reforms are enacted to re-Arabicize Lebanon and force it to re-enter the brotherly world of Arab nationalism. In education, foreign-language instruction is increasingly prohibited.

While the trading volume has soared, along with the stock market, since last August, the Value Line, Standard & Poor's 500 and New York Stock Exchange composite indexes remain ''coin-toss markets'' to most traders.

The signs of battle can elude the untutored eye: an activity sheet here","excerpt":"a table of beans, buttons, geometric blocks and other math manipulatives there. And the lines of battle can deceive: they have shifted with the latest findings on early childhood development and assessments of the quality of American education.    Even the goals have changed as Americans have redefined the role of school: To prepare children for the rites and rigors of academe? To teach them social skills? To Americanize and educate immigrant children quickly and well?    Always at the heart of the dispute, however, is the questions of how children learn best and, knowing that, how best to teach them, says Liliam G. Katz, a professor of early childhood education at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. \\"Debate over the answer,\\" she added, \\"has raged back and forth like a pendulum for the last 100 years.\\"    Where once the various sides squared off over curriculum issues of \\"play\\" or \\"activities\\" versus \\"academics,\\" and \\"open\\" as against \\"structured\\" classrooms, today the debate often pits the \\"child-centered\\" approach against the \\"teacher-centered\\" one.    \\"In its pure form, the child-centered approach says that if you provide the right environment -- different activity areas, concrete objects to manipulate -- and let children loose in it, things will happen,\\" said Professor Katz, who is president of the Washington-based National Association for Education of Young Children, the nation's largest professional association of early childhood educators. The teacher-centered approach, very simply put, has the teacher pouring knowledge into children; youngsters learn skills -- often through drills and practice -- determined by the teacher and the school. A Trend to Commercial Curriculums    The few national studies on the subject show that both approaches can be found in kindergartens throughout the country. But researchers suggest a trend toward using commercially prepared curriculums that focus on narrowly defined academic skills, like letter recognition and counting. And a drumbeat of voices is increasingly warning, sometimes with a religious fervor, that these curriculums are too tough and will lead more and more youngsters to fail.    Now a truce is being forged: Whatever teachers teach and however they teach it, their approach should be developmentally appropriate.    \\"We mean that while we shouldn't teach beyond what a kid is capable of knowing and learning, we shouldn't teach below what he is capable of knowing and learning either,\\" said Bernard Spodek, a professor of early childhood development at the University of Illinois. \\"The idea is to see what a child is capable of and then try to extend and challenge that without frustrating him.\\"    The aim, researchers and educators agree, is to instill in kindergarteners a desire to learn. And they should actually learn something, too; their intellectual abilities and problem-solving skills should be enhanced.    That kindergarten has changed was inevitable, if only because kindergarteners themselves have changed. Most are veterans of day care, nursery school or some other preschool arrangement. They are also full-fledged members of the television generation.    \\"Kindergarten may no longer be where all these children learn their colors or to count,\\" said Rebecca S. New, an associate professor of education and coordinator of the graduate program in early childhood education at the University of New Hampshire in Durham.    Indeed, with television, movies and computers, educational toys and electronic games, knowledge that was once esoteric is now commonplace. As a result, parents and teachers often expect more academically of the kindergarten crowd, although for many youngsters day care may have constituted poor-quality baby-sitting in an uninviting place.    The demand for a more academic, \\"back to basics\\" kingergarten accelerated in the 1980's, especially in the wake of \\"A Nation at Risk,\\" a 1983 Federal commission report suggesting that many children in the United States were failing to achieve in school. In a \\"push-down\\" effect, the pressure was on to give American students an earlier, some thought better start, and teach in kindergarten the math and reading skills once taught in first grade.    Recently, other pro-academic forces have come into play. There are, for example, first-grade teachers who refuse to accept kindergarten graduates ill prepared for the basic-skills tests that elementary-school children are increasingly taking. And there are kindergarten teachers who are certified for grades K though 6, 8 or 9 and teach kindergarten as they would fourth grade.    Professor New noted that society's success norms had risen. \\"It's not enough to graduate from high school,\\" she said. \\"You must attend college. Parents, particularly minority or immigrant parents, acting as advocates for their children thus want schools to put youngsters in a competitive position. Pushing Children Prematurely?    The backlash took its time, but in the late 1980's books such as David Elkind's \\"The Hurried Child\\" appeared, suggesting that children were being pushed prematurely to act like adults in all aspects of life. At the same time, early childhood development experts, who had focused on day care, awoke to the increase in kindergarten attendance. In 1965 only 59.5 percent of 5-year-olds were enrolled in kindergarten, according to the National Center for Education Statistics; by 1992 the figure exceeded 80 percent.    The researchers started pushing their findings into the public's domain. \\"All the literature said that young children learn best when they are interested in something, when it relates to their lives, when it offers a cognitive conflict -- that is, there is no easy answer, so they may need help and must work with others,\\" said Professor New.    The response in some kindergartens has been a rejection of academics in favor of a kindergarten 50's-style, in which socialization skills are emphasized, friendships are made and children are cradled in a nurturing atmosphere.    Such a regimen functions almost as an extension of day care, teaching children to operate in a group, away from home and under the care and authority of someone other than their parents. Youngsters are also socialized to the culture of school: arriving on time, following instructions and being quiet for some small part of a regulated day.    But just as the contemporary, academic kindergarten may set cognitive goals few 5 year-olds can attain, the retro-classic kindergarten may ignore children's cognitive development entirely.    \\"Learning is messy,\\" said Yvonne Smith, a kindergarten teacher at Central Park East Elementary School on East 106th Street in Manhattan. With a master's degree in early childhood education and 20 years of teaching experience, Ms. Smith should know.    \\"Lots of lessons are imbedded in a single subject or activity,\\" she explained. \\"We're looking at animals, for example. There is vocabulary describing the animals, books about animals, the sorting of animals by color and shape, type and size. There are paintings to be made of animals and stories to write and recite about them. There is even measuring, especially since one child wanted to know how long it took a giraffe to swallow with such a long neck.\\" An Impression of Organized Chaos    Organized chaos is what a visitor sees in this class of 25, with small groups of children intently clustered in different activity areas around the room, like the dry sand table, the writing table and the cooking corner. There is a library and a listening area with tapes, and Huggy, the class guinea pig.    The children choose where they will work at the start of the day, their choices written for all to see. Labels abound in this room, indicating with a name, a drawing, a numeral, gingerbread-type figures and a spelled-out number the nature of each activity area and how many children can work there.    \\"Children must assemble and disassemble, interact with other children and adults to figure out how the world works,\\" Ms. Smith explained. \\"They must do it in a setting that takes care of and develops each child, physically, socially, emotionally and cognitively.\\"    But they are not free to roam. Through the pockets of quiet concentration and the hubbub of discovery, there is Ms. Smith, watching and guiding; suggesting to one youngster that she has the makings of the color brown on her palette of many hues; listening to another child spin a tale from single letters on a page. \\"But clearly, she knows that each letter stands for a word,\\" Ms. Smith said.    Is learning going on here? \\"My son, Bryant, entered this class barely speaking English,\\" said Mei Siu, who came to the United States from Hong Kong 10 years ago. \\"Now he speaks it well. Sometimes he reads to me: he can't read the words, but he can tell me the story. More important, he is independent, confident in himself. I know of relatives whose children are in stricter, more traditional classes, but they haven't learned as much as my son.\\"   Across town at Public School 163 on West 97th Street, an airy orderliness characterizes Ilene Golembiovsky's kindergarten class of 24. There are fewer activity areas here, and everything from blocks to books is more neatly stored. But on a dreary day this room is awash with artwork and names on the wall, and alive with children, seated on the floor eagerly counting out a classmate's six years.    It's Joshua's birthday, as the sign he proudly wears around his neck said. \\"I am 6 six years old today.\\"    \\"And one for good luck,\\" Mrs. Golembiovsky said. \\"Six plus one is . . .\\"    \\"Seven,\\" the class shouted.   \\"Good,\\" said the teacher in the first of many encouraging words for the day.    In this class the teacher, with a master's degree in early childhood education and almost 29 years of experience, calls many of the tunes, determining the activities and imparting knowledge. But her nurturing nature is unmistakable -- \\"I make sure to tell them when I make a mistake so they know it's no big deal,\\" she said -- and the children willingly go along.    \\"Socialization is most important here,\\" she said. \\"Working together, sharing. We all have classroom jobs, so that we all learn to be both responsible and independent.\\"    But, she added, \\"many of my parents really care about academics, learning to read, learning to count, pushing ahead, pushing ahead, pushing ahead.\\"   Workbooks are used, as is a phonics-alphabet chant. \\"They are what parents want these days, and surprisingly, the children love it because it's what the big kids do,\\" Mrs. Golembiovsky said, adding that the youngsters proudly point to finished pages as an accomplishment. She considers the materials \\"supplemental, reinforcement for other things we do in class.\\"   On this day there is also a project on shoes, with youngsters deciding who is wearing shoes -- as against boots or sneakers -- and how many there are of each color and what size, as they trace their footwear on paper, which they label with their names and will post for all to see.   Is learning going on here? \\"My son Stephen didn't want to go to school,\\" said his mother, Virginia Adams. \\"Now even when he's sick, he wants to go. He had playtime in day care. Here, he's learned to write his name; he excitedly points to words and spells them out.\\"    The lesson here is clear, said Deborah Stipek, a professor at the Graduate School of Education of the University of California at Los Angeles, who has studied the effects of both kinds of kindergartens on students.   First, most kindergartens offer some combination of child-initiated and teacher-directed, or at least teacher-guided, activities.    Second, people should not judge an activity by whether it is in some category, but rather by whether it is appropriate for particular children in a particular place.    In kindergartens of Spanish-speaking youngsters, for example, Claude Goldenberg, the associate director of the urban education studies center at U.C.L.A.'s Graduate School of Education, found \\"unambiguously academic\\" classes that emphasized drills and workbooks successfully teaching 5-year-olds the basics of reading and literacy development.    \\"To my surprise, these kids were learning,\\" Professor Goldenberg said. \\"And they weren't just testing well. I talked to them and their parents; these kids couldn't wait to show me how they could read; they loved school.\\"   Even Professor Stipek's yet-unpublished research suggests that teacher-directed activities using drill and practice, worksheets and group instruction may teach some children important skills. \\"What is important about any activity or teaching approach is that the child show enthusiasm and interest in what's happening in class,\\" she said, \\"that the child take pride in his or her accomplishment, and that the child learns something from it.\\"  Cautionary Tales of the Extremes    Cautionary tales abound about kindergartens at the extremes. Virtually all the researchers and teachers interviewed said they knew of or had seen \\"sit down, shut up, count to 10\\" classes in which teachers had little time, and no patience, for children who deviated from a curriculum of activity sheets, drill and practice, requiring children to sit at desks or tables for long periods.    Several educators also spoke of observing \\"anything goes\\" classrooms in which teachers rarely intervened. Some youngsters were overwhelmed into inaction by the choices available to them, or bored because no one was guiding and extending their activities. Many simply cruised from activity to activity, turning what should have been a journey of self-discovery into an exercise in self-indulgence.   What can parents do to steer a healthy course for their children?    The answer, educators agree, is to see for yourself. Parents should arrange to visit the kindergarten classroom and observe. Begin by determining if your child enjoys school.   Professor Stipek cautioned, however, that \\"What looks like play to parents can be serious learning to kids. Ask the teacher why the children are making muffins or counting buttons.\\"    A good teacher, she said, should be able to tell you the goal or purpose of an activity. She should be able to assess whether each child is achieving that goal, and should adjust the activity accordingly.   Ms. Smith said that \\"parents have to trust a school and their child's teacher. If they are uncomfortable with the teaching philosophy and approach, then they can never work in partnership with the teacher in their child's interest. Their child will never get the support he or she needs to learn.\\"   Her advice in such cases? \\"Take your child out of that class and find a kindergarten where both you and your youngster are happy.\\" Building a Better Kindergarten"},{"year":"1981","title":"It is not a subtle dish, more a palatable bombardment of garlic and chiles and the flavor of the ocean, to be attacked with exuberance after a morning on a sun-struck coral beach or snorkeling on the reef, when the salt taste lingers and there is a dazzle to everything.

The resulting drama is a warm and compassionate study, though not too new in concept. For this basically simple love story makes no great discoveries but merely reaffirms some universal truths. However, it is by virtue of poignant and artistic performances that this romance about the courageous women who stand and wait at home for their intrepid fighting men avoids the maudlin and banal.In the main this tale concerns itself with Lisa and her aviator husband, Nikolai, and Andrei and his wife, Sonia. When the men are reported missing at the front it is Lisa who, despite her awful burden, is steadfast in her pledge to wait, while Sonia succumbs to her apparent loss in gay forgetfulness. The return of Andrei to his now faithless wife is a tragic commentary on the ravages of war. And, although Nikolai's fate is held in suspense after the crash of his plane and the exciting Nazi man-hunt which ensues, his eventual return is an inspiring fulfillment of his wife's unswerving hope.As Lisa, Valentina Serova's anguished heroine is a real, sometimes pathetic and always restrained person. Boris Blinov, as her husband, and Lev Sverdlin, Nikolai Nazvanov, Nina Zorskaia and Piotr Geraga, as featured players, also turn in excellent portrayals. But, while the Russian cast is avoiding the pitfalls of pat performances, the English dialogue which has been dubbed into the film never quite measures up to their efforts.

In his play \\"Bingo,\\" Mr. Bond considered Shakespeare in retirement as a disgruntled landowner and eventual suicide.         In his probing new play, \\"The Herbal Bed\\" (in the Other Place theater at Stratford), Peter Whelan muses about a sidelong event in the life of Shakespeare's family and creates a finely textured tapestry of love and lies in  early-17th-century Stratford. In contrast to Mr. Bond, Mr. Whelan circumspectly  keeps Shakespeare just offstage. Yet his presence is deeply felt. Through the eyes of his older daughter, Susanna Hall, we have a telling glimpse of the playwright's mortality, and also of his impact on his tightly knit Elizabethan community.

Like most of these young men who are caught in the opening chapter sowing their wild oats, James takes stock of the error of his ways and forthwith banks a ???ere matter of $4,000 and accepts a decent position. Hence for the balance of this tale Mr. O'Connor was making himself as sympathetic as possible. He goes up in an airplane with Jeanne Cavanaugh (Miss Mackaill) and does not appear to be in the least nervous, not even when it becomes known that the under-carriage of the machine has been detached through a brush with the telegraph wires.A most natural scene is that in which scores of persons are beheld running to the spot where the airplane is supposed to have turned turtle in landing. There is the ambulance plunging over the rough ground, the groups of people here and there converging to the one centre, and finally the glimpse of the wreck and an unconscious girl.Scotty does most of the good work in this picture and in the end loses Jeanne. He appears, however, to be quite happy when he embraces Diana O'Sullivan (Miss Brooks).\\"The Girl From Coney Island,\\" or \\"Just Another Blonde,\\" is a well directed picture.

And despite all the skepticism with respect to both, he came out a winner. He managed to reject conservative ideologues' advice with respect to both, and went along with the moderate, understanding, sensitive middle voice which did not turn off the third world.''

It is a film in which the producers reveal an overwhelming fondness for sound in stentorian volume. And most of the players were equipped with lung power sufficient to meet the desires of the director, Frank Strayer. It is true that this film has a certain quality of mirth, but, how welcome would be an occasional whisper or a soft voice!The dialogue is the work of Frederic and Fanny Hatton, and while it is nothing brilliant, nothing sauvc or subtle, it often opens up the way to ludicrous incidents. The characters involved are not called upon to be especially observant or intelligent. In fact it is their stupidity that results in the blacksmithean type of humor.In this picture, Ford Sterling, long a comedian in silent films, makes his début with a voice. And, allowing for the delicate mechanism of the microphone, Mr. Sterling does far better in this offering than he has in most of his latter-day mute parts, for he has at least been curbed of his tendency to act as though all the other characters were deaf. Here he has a chance to use his voice and nobody will be able to say that he can't be heard, except possibly in a fraction of the film when the sound failed. Whether there is any color to his tones is a matter of opinion. He succeeds, however, in talking as if he meant what he was saying. He is aided and abetted a good deal of the time by Jed Prouty, who also sees to it that those in the rear seats of ???e theatre have their money's worth of voice. Every seat is a front seat with both Mr. Sterling and Mr. Prouty, so far as this production is concerned.Patsy Ruth Miller is sometimes quite good, but now and again she lapses in her enunciation. Betty Farrington, an actress of unusual weight, succeeds not only in being heard, but also in imitating a woman who has spent an evening imbibing freely of alcoholic beverages. Gertrude Astor endeavors to give a portrayal of a haughty wife in high dudgeon. One might say that all the voices, with the exception of Miss Miller and Arthur Rankin, seem to have been tested for carrying power rather than for any tonal nuances.The merriment consists of Tom Ford Sr. making arrangements for his prospective customer. Mr. Mack, to go out with him and Eve Grant (Miss Miller). Mrs. Mack (Betty Farrington) insists, however, on accompanying her husband and therefore Eve is introduced as Mrs. Tom Ford. The real Mrs. Tom Ford is spending a week-end—or intended doing so—with friends, but during a bridge rubber she hears over the radio that a certain selection in a night club has been requested by Mr. and Mrs. Tom Ford, which causes her to be more than slightly disturbed. She decides abruptly to return to her home, and while she is on her way Mr. Ford, his son, Tom Ford Jr., and Mr. and Mrs. Mack experience some hectic moments due chiefly to the persistence of Mrs. Mack.One of the more or less laughable situations occurs in the night club, when Tom Ford Jr., who is in love with Eve, enters with the badge of a revenue officer. Mr. Mack at that moment is emptying his flask into a glass, and as soon as he realizes that the eye of the law is upon him he drops the flask under the table and kicks it as far as he can.The real Mrs. Ford, who is expected momentarily by the audience, arrives during a relatively quiet period of the fuss, Mr. Mack, whom she has never seen, has left his noisy wife to forage in the ice-box. Mrs. Ford observes the shadow of the stranger and adds to the boisterousness of this adventure by calling the police. And the man who answers her call is impersonated by Fred Kelsey, who hasn't the least sonorous voice in Hollywood.It ends very much in the way one expects, and after the \\"tumult and the shouting\\" died away the little Embassy Theatre was itself again, for all the voices of the friends of the producers and others did not make anything like the din that came from the screen during the more obstreperous stretches of the picture. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A Talking Farce-Comedy. Peace and War."},{"year":"1941","title":"Yellowstone Natl Pk, Oct-Aug IN YELLOWSTONE PARK","excerpt":"A Talking Kewpie Doll Serves To Drive the Bears Away"},{"year":"1928","title":"Through the painstaking work of Roy J. Pomeroy, the film magician who \\"parted the Red Sea\\" in Cecil B. DeMille's picture, \\"The Ten Commandments,\\" the audible screen adaptation of the play \\"Interference\\" is in many respects so remarkable that it may change the opinion of countless skeptics concerning talking photoplays. The vocal reproductions are extraordinarily fine and the incidental sounds have been registered with consummate intelligence. As a play it would naturally be considered far from perfect, but as a specimen in the strides made by the talking picture it is something to create no little wonderment.Those who might have felt that perhaps Daniel Frohman, whose shadow was heard in an address prior to the showing of the main feature, was perhaps a trifle too enthusiastic about the talking film, after the presentation possibly agreed with him. Mr. Frohman said in part:\\"I speak to you from the screen itself—triumphantly and with utter confidence in the new future that stretches before us. It was only last Winter that this play we are about to see tonight was enacted on the boards of the Lyceum Theatre. It was presented by the company which was founded by my brother, the late Charles Frohman. Tonight, carrying on the Frohman tradition, I once more welcome you on behalf of Mr. Zukor and Mr. Lasky to the inauguration of the greatest era in entertainment—an era made possible through this miraculous invention, the talking picture. No more will our best plays be confined to the few big cities. These plays, with their stirring drama enhanced by the richness of the human voice, will go to the whole world.\\"As the picture with excellent diction was unfurled, it became quite clear that the Paramount officials had learned something by the mistakes of others. There were no muffled sentences and no disturbing explosive utterances. This spoken picture continued its melodramatic route on an even keel, with good expression and without the tinny timbre so often heard in its forerunners. The ringing of a telephone bell was natural and so was the knock on a door. One even heard a pen scratching its way over the paper as Evelyn Brent wrote a missive with her left hand. Yet the auxiliary sounds were not overdone, and those that were heard were not obtrusive, merely interesting. Mr. Pomeroy even gives the voice of an unseen person over the telephone, and one felt intensely thankful that this excellent piece of work was not marred by a love theme song being rendered as Sir John Marlay told his wife how much he adored her.It could, of course, still be improved upon. The uptake of the lines is not always naturally timed. There are pauses that begin to make one uncomfortable, and the wording of the utterances could be strengthened materially in a number of instances.Considering that William Powell had to play the rôole portrayed before the footlights by that brilliant actor, A. E. Matthews, he gave a most creditable characterization, realizing the necessary restraint to get the most out of the part.The story, it may be remembered, is concerned with Lady Marlay's supposedly dead husband turning up under an assumed name and a consequent blackmailing plot conducted by a woman, who discovers that the \\"dead\\" man is in the land of the living. It is a cleverly contrived affair in which Philip Voaze, who was supposed to have met death on the battlefield, admits that he has given poison to Deborah Kane, after the tentacles of suspicion have commenced to entwine themselves around Sir John and Lady Marlay.Clive Brook, who has had experience on the stage, gives a capital account of himself as the eminent surgeon Sir John Marlay. Doris Kenyon is beautiful and impressive as Lady Marlay. Evelyn Brent does fine work as Deborah Kane, the blackmailer. Brandon Hurst also gives a sound and natural impersonation of a Scotland Yard inspector.While there are at times strange pauses between the lines of the players, the story is always clear and the characters are quite well defined. Moreover, when there are opportunities for the silent incidents it results in nicely worked-out suspense. It is a melodrama of the more sophisticated type, without any shouting or screaming.This picture was first produced as a silent effort by Lothar Mendes. Many of the scenes of this current work are undoubtedly based on that version, but Mr. Pomeroy undertook not only to give the characters voices, but also to direct them in their utterances. And here it might be said that only in a few cases is the lisp perceptible. When the Scotland Yard Inspector is searching for a stopper of the bottle containing the poison, it rather sounded like \\"thopper\\" each time he said it. Yet when Mr. Powell produced the stopper and called attention to it the word did not seem to have even a tinge of a lisp. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A Talking Melodrama. JUILLIARD PUPILS PLAY.

The women at agriculture and cooking, the males at hunting, fishing and house building. They have witch doctors and a chieftain, and when they die their bodies are buried under the floors of their own huts.While the film has no story interwoven with the scenic and village sequences and lacks an imaginative treatment, it is nevertheless a sufficiently pleasing one and manages to sustain a fair amount of interest.

It has acres of rundown and abandoned properties, many along the 23 miles of waterfront, and the low land and housing prices are increasingly being viewed as benefits.\\n\\n\\"We're currently working more than $500 million in private development,\\" Ms. Shean said. \\"In downtown alone, we've seen $128 million worth of developer investment -- job-creating investment, tax-creating investment -- in the last three years. And there's more coming.\\" \\n\\nInterest has been spurred by a freeway to the city joining Route I-80, the Bay Area's main route between San Jose and Sacramento, with the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge across San Francisco Bay. A second route through Richmond from the bridge to a more northerly juncture with I-80 is being built.\\n\\nThe first tenant in Point Richmond was Pixar, a graphic imaging and software concern, which is the park's largest occupant. It moved from San Rafael to Richmond to expand. An offshoot of the Lucas Film Company, founded by the filmmaker George Lucas, Pixar has taken 43,000 square feet. \\n\\nIn contrast to Richmond, San Rafael is a generally affluent city in one of California's most affluent areas, Marin County. But Marin has such stringent slow-growth policies that little new commercial space is available, and what is available is dear. \\n\\nRents for fully serviced office space in Marin range from $24 to $36 a square foot, Wareham's president, Rich Robbins, said. In Point Richmond, by comparison, rents range from $12 to $18.60 a square foot, fully serviced.

In it a recording phonograph plays an important part. Through this instrument Frank Fields's little son is first suspected of shooting his stepmother and finally the truth comes out, much to the surprise of Anton Lebau, who had only been released a few weeks before from a Paris prison.At the outset this production promises to be an interesting yarn, but so soon as the father in the case. Mr. Fields, goes to Paris one begins to sigh. It is known by that time that Fields is devoted to his son, Jimmy, 10 years old, and it is thought that Fields is possessed of a good share of common sense. This father, however, discovers an alluring blonde, a Countess of ill repute, in the French capital, and before he can be deterred he marries her. This flaxen-haired creature's partner in crime is sentenced to six months in jail and while he is frowning behind the bars, the Countess, as Mrs. Fields, comes with her husband to America.The new Mrs. Fields is offended by the portrait of the first Mrs. Fields, a painting which, as shown on the screen, would be an eyesore to anybody. So one rather sympathizes with her in having it removed by the butler. Mrs. Fields, née a countess, perceives, as does the audience, that Jimmy is none too pleased with the taking down of the painting of his own mother. But the stepmother promptly informs the boy that she does not like to be reminded of her \\"predecessor.\\"Time flies, and then sometimes it doesn't, in this film. But perhaps one is safe in saying that one day Jimmy is soundly thrashed by his father for insubordination toward the stepmother, and he therefore decides to make himself scarce and goes to live with the charming and sympathic Miss White, whom one knows from the very start Mr. Fields ought to have married.Strange doings occur during those hectic days. Mr. Fields tries to show his wife that there is a silver lining behind every thunder cloud. She pounces upon a letter addressed to her husband and the audience is permitted to read that she is an adventuress, which, of course, poor Mr. Fields doesn't know. Mrs. Fields, almost before her husband's eyes, puts the letter in the fire, and what seems to be a long, long while afterward, Mr. Fields pieces the burned bits of paper together and discovers the horrible truth. The flames in this case appear to have been quite in sympathy with Mr. Fields and his son, Jimmy.The phonograph appears also to be in league with Fields, his son and Miss White, for it looks very much as though it had recorded two statements in the same place on a record. But that matters little, for after all the story is puerile in more ways than one.The dialogue is heard during an opening episode and then the old subtitle turns up boldly. For the purposes of utilizing the phonograph in the closing chapter there is another outburst of sound, and some of the voices are quite good, but others, especially that of Wheeler Oakman, who figures as the conscienceless Lebau, are little more than muffled babbling.Jack Holt, who plays the father, can do better acting, and he is to be sympathized with in this tale of stupidity, tears and bloodshed. Dorothy Revier is attractive and she hardly looks the part of an adventuress. Helene Chadwick, as Miss White, is the personification of all that's sweet. Mickey McBan is quite good as Jimmy.Some entertaining short talking films preface the feature. One in which Jules Bledsoe sings two songs is particularly effective.

The crew was also vexed by a balky lid on another astronomy experiment in the ship's cargo bay","excerpt":"a tempermental medical device used in studies of space sickness; a backup fuel line that got too cold, and a materials processing furnace that malfunctioned when one of the astronauts loaded it incorrectly.   Plans to use a special image-brightening device to observe the comet were scrapped when it was discovered that the instrument had broken down.   But Dr. George D. Nelson, an astronomer and one of Columbia's seven crew members, tried to salvage the day by using a special camera to take long exposures of the celebrated ''dirty snowball,'' the first photos of the comet taken from orbit while it nears the sun on its 76-year roundtrip.

At the end of one concert, the eight punkishly dressed young percussionists who were about to play Christopher Rouse's \\"Bonham\\" bounded onto the stage with their arms raised and their fists clenched in a gesture of rock-and-roll triumphalism. A small but assertive part of the audience shouted, stomped and whistled as if the ensemble were a famous rock band, and when the six-minute piece ended, this claque shouted again and held cigarette lighters aloft.    That this rumpus was clearly premeditated did not matter because, in effect, it was a kind of on- and offstage choreography that grew out of the work's musical substance. And that substance was even stranger than the posturing, for in composing \\"Bonham\\" -- a tribute to Led Zeppelin's drummer, John Bonham, who died in 1980 -- Mr. Rouse reached unabashedly into rock-and-roll's bag of tricks, came up with some useful ideas, and wove them into a cohesive concert piece.

The building will disappoint those who think that a contemporary art museum should be housed within an architectural wild child, a structure as provocative as the  art it displays. But it should gratify those who revere Chicago as the first city of American architecture.         This deeply earnest building offers a stern, impressive rebuttal to the wayward frivolity that has diluted Chicago's architectural heritage in recent years. But its rapt obedience to that heritage raises new problems in turn.
