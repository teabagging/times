Theology students did this, and their Roman Catholic priests sheltered them while arranging for their surrender. Now the fathers are on trial under the harsh National Security Law, and the students are termed Marxists. In May came the worst financial scandal in Korean history. Shady manipulations on the informal money market running into the hundreds of millions of dollars shook an economy that exists on state-controlled credit. Several companies went bankrupt, much of the Cabinet resigned and President Chun drew the wagons around the Blue House, stonewalling amid allegations that the loan sharks had close ties to him and his wife. In early June, women who are electronics workers held two Americans hostage for nine hours, until the American Embassy notified the Korean police and had the workers arrested.

The Americans held a 3-to-1 advantage in offensive rebounds, and repeatedly used second and third shots to help build a lead that grew to its high of 30 points in the final seconds.

COACH From his bushy mustache to his diverse resume, Xabier Azkargorta stands apart from the rest of the World Cup coaching fraternity. A specialist in traumatic medicine, Azkargorta, a 40-year-old Basque, left his practice at the end of 1992 to take over the Bolivian team. The result was spectacular as the Bolivians qualified for the finals on their own for the first time in history. STYLE They often use a 5-4-1 (five defenders, four midfielders and one striker), but that does not mean they are defensive-minded. Their midfielders and outside defenders are very quick to counterattack, which helps explain how the team scored more goals (22) than any other in South America during qualifying. TOP PLAYERS Bolivia's strength is its midfield, which would have been considerably stronger if its star, 24-year-old Marco Etcheverry, weren't hampered by a knee injury. The Bolivians will be forced to rely more heavily on attacking midfielder Erwin (Platini) Sanchez of the Portuguese club Boavista. Sanchez, like his French namesake, is a remarkable passer and has a gift for free kicks. Julio Cesar Baldivieso, another midfielder, also bears watching, as does striker William Ramallo, who led the continent in scoring during qualifying with seven goals. OUTLOOK The bad news for the Bolivians is that Denver is not a World Cup site. They perform best in high altitude and won all four of their matches at home in La Paz, which lies at about 13,000 feet. But hyperventilating opponents do not explain all of Bolivia's success. The real explanation lies in a new generation of players and the inspirational influence of Azkargorta. The presence of Spain in the same group and uncertainty over Etcheverry mean the Bolivians are unlikely to see the second round. Germany CUP APPEARANCES 12 (1934, 1938, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990. East Germany in 1974) LAST CUP Champion in 1990 (beat Argentina, 1-0) BEST SHOWING Champion in 1954, 1974 and 1990 FIRST ROUND Bolivia, June 17 in Chicago; Spain, June 21 in Chicago, and South Korea, June 27 in Dallas. COACH Hubert (Berti) Vogts played in three World Cup finals (1970, 1974, 1978) for the national team and was named German player of the year in 1975 and 1979. He has spent his entire coaching career with the German Football Federation, working with juniors and as an assistant coach before replacing Franz Beckenbauer in 1990. STYLE Precise, relentless and remarkably cohesive. Lothar Matthaus should prove a more versatile sweeper than Thomas Berthold, who started against Argentina four years ago. The continuing brilliance of Thomas Hassler and the rise of Stefan Effenberg, Matthias Sammer and Andreas Moller guarantee that the Germans will remain aggressive in midfield. TOP PLAYERS At 33, Mat thaus is no longer the dominant creative force of 1990, but the captain remains a cut above his peers as he prepares for his fourth cup appearance. Nine of the 11 players who started in the 1990 final are back, including Bodo Illgner, Jurgen Klinsmann, Rudi Voller, Hassler and Andreas Brehme. The best of the new crop: Effenberg, Sammer and Moller. OUTLOOK Germany has played more matches (68) in the cup finals than any other nation; there's no reason to believe it won't get to play 7 more this year. Beckenbauer's inspirational qualities will be missed, but the Germans are poised and talented enough to inspire themselves. South Korea CUP APPEARANCES Three (1954, 1986, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (0-3) BEST SHOWING Never past the first round FIRST ROUND Spain, June 17 in Dallas; Bolivia, June 23 in Foxboro, Mass.; Germany, June 27 in Dallas. COACH Despite seven years as a defender with the South Korean national team, Kim Ho never made it to the World Cup finals as a player. Ho, 49, started his coaching career in 1979 as an assistant with the national under-19 team, where he helped develop many of the players on South Korea's 1986 and 1990 cup teams. He became coach of the national team in September 1992. STYLE South Korea is a dangerous counterattacking team that, against Asian competition, likes to penetrate up the wings, particularly the right side where Noh Jung Yoon is faster and more powerful than most who mark him. TOP PLAYERS The attacking midfielder Kim Joo Sung, the only South Korean playing in Europe, has the biggest reputation. A former Asian player of the year, he started for South Korea in the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals and adopted the nickname Sampson because of his long hair that he said gave him strength and courage. But he was overshadowed during qualifying by another attacking midfielder, Noh Jung Yoon, a compact and swift technician who usually operates on the right wing. The South Koreans also may have the best goalkeeper in Asia in Choi In Young and a midfielder who was sensational in Qatar in Shin Hong Gi. OUTLOOK The first Asian team to play in four World Cup finals does not have an illustrious past from which to draw confidence. In eight previous matches against the globe's best, the South Koreans have managed only one tie and have been outscored, 29-5. Ho's goal is the second round, and such ambition is admirable. Spain CUP APPEARANCES Eight (1934, 1950, 1962, 1966, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (Lost to Yugoslavia, 2-1 in second round) BEST SHOWING Quarterfinals in 1934 and 1986 FIRST ROUND South Korea, June 17 in Dallas; Germany, June 21 in Chicago, and Bolivia, June 27 in Chicago. COACH Outspoken and combative, Javier Clemente has been directing the national team for less than two years and has reshaped it profoundly, phasing out such high-profile World Cup veterans as Michel and Emilio Butragueno and opting for youth and solidarity in the form of nine players from Spain's best club, FC Barcelona.   STYLE The Spaniards are very versatile, with many players capable of doing damage. They are so versatile that Clemente has been criticized for not developing a true playmaker. Unless midfielder Julen Guerrero emerges, the creating will be left largely to Jose Maria Bakero, who plays behind the front line in the 4-4-2 and, like many of the Spaniards, is extremely dangerous with his head. TOP PLAYERS Among the best are striker Julio Salinas, midfielders Josep Guardiola and Bakero, defenders Albert Ferrer and Miguel Angel Nadal and the venerable goaltender Andoni Zubizarreta, one of the rare holdovers from the 1990 cup team. Zubizarreta will have to miss the opening game, however, after being suspended early in the first half of Spain's decisive qualifying match against Denmark.   OUTLOOK With Spain's depth, skill and weak first-round opposition (Germany, of course, excepted), it should be a lock for the second round and just might make it go the semifinal.

In the early Yayoi period, a mounted military aristocracy dominated rice-growing commoners. The shamanic religion of the time was ancestral to Japan's later indigenous religion, Shinto. Yayoi society evolved into the Yamato protostate, c. A.D. 250–500. The Yamato kings were buried in large, elaborate tomb mounds together with haniwa clay sculptures. From the third century A.D., contact with the mainland increased. Korean missionaries introduced Buddhism and Chinese writing in the mid-sixth century. A centralized monarchy developed in the Yamato Plain, central Honshu Island; Prince Shotoku, a great patron of Buddhism, founded the Horyuji and other great temples in the early seventh century. In 710 the Yamato kings established a permanent capital for the first time, at Nara; the city was modeled on the Chinese capital. In 785 the court, split by factionalism and dominated by Nara's large and wealthy Buddhist temples, abandoned the capital; in 794 the new capital at Heian (Kyoto) was completed. The ensuing Heian period was one of the most brilliant in Japanese history. A small civil aristocracy, dominated by the Fujiwara family, drew great wealth from provincial estates and created a metropolitan culture of extreme refinement. From the ninth through the 11th centuries, strong Chinese influences were incorporated into Japanese culture. In the 12th century the power of the Heian court waned as the influence of the provincial military aristocracy (samurai) grew stronger. In 1156 the capital was seized by the Taira family; in 1185 the Taira were overthrown by their rivals, the Minamoto. The Minamoto established a military government under a shogun (generalissimo) at Kamakura; the emperor remained at Kyoto, stripped of all governmental authority. In Kamakura the Minamoto were soon displaced by their former vassals, the Hojo. During the Kamakura period, the Japanese drew away from Chinese influence in art, architecture, literature, and religion in the process of creating a more distinctively Japanese culture. In 1274 and again in 1281, Mongol invasions were repulsed with the aid of timely typhoons ( kamikaze , “divine winds”). In the course of a failed attempt at imperial restoration, the Kamakura shogunate was overthrown, in the 1330's, by the Ashikaga family, which in 1338 established a new shogunal government at Muromachi, a precinct of Kyoto. The Muromachi period saw the flowering of a new warrior culture, marked by such military virtues as bravery, loyalty, personal honor, and skill with weapons and by adherence to Zen Buddhism and its associated arts (tea ceremony, flower arranging, calligraphy, etc.). With the Onin Wars of the mid-15th century, the Muromachi shogunate lost most of its power, and the country fell into a century of civil war. The civil wars were brought to an end during the second half of the 16th century by three successive unifiers, Oda Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu. At the same time, the Jesuit Francis Xavier and his successors established a short-lived Japanese Christian community. Hideyoshi made several attempts (1592–98) to conquer and annex Korea. In 1601 Tokugawa Ieyasu defeated his rivals in the Battle of Sekigahara. He established a shogunal government at Edo (later Tokyo) in 1603; he and his successors formalized the structure of Japanese feudalism, created a rigid class structure, suppressed Christianity, and enforced the isolation of Japan from virtually all outside influence. Some trade with the mainland and a small Dutch trading station at Nagasaki provided Japan's only windows to the outside world for the next 250 years. The Edo period was marked by urbanization and the development of urban culture (Kabuki theater, wood-block prints, etc.) as the merchant class prospered from internal trade. The Tokugawa shogun's inability to repel the 1854 visit of American commodore Matthew Perry and subsequently to avoid establishing commercial and diplomatic relations with Western nations deeply shocked the samurai class. Patriotic young samurai from Choshu, Satsuma, and other outlying feudal domains began to call for the abolition of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial rule in order to confront the threat of contact with the West. Quickly realizing that isolationism was doomed, the young radicals' program changed from “respect the emperor, expel the barbarians” to “enrich the state, strengthen the military.” With the accession of the Meiji emperor in 1868, shogunal government ended. Under direct imperial rule, feudalism was abolished and a wide-ranging program of military, industrial, commercial, and social modernization was implemented. The Meiji Constitution of 1889 created a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system of government. Having avoided domination by Western nations, Japan itself became an imperialist power. Defeating China in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 and Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, Japan gained a dominant position in Manchuria and in Korea, which became a Japanese colony in 1910. Under the ineffectual Taisho emperor (reigned 1912–26), parliamentary government flourished. Japan sided with the Allied Powers in World War I, and the Treaty of Versailles advanced Japan's international interests, particularly in China. The general prosperity of the 1920's was threatened by the Tokyo earthquake of 1923, by labor strife, and by a stagnant agricultural economy. Militant right-wing nationalism began to play an important role in domestic politics. During the international economic depression of the early 1930's, right-wing militants gained the upper hand; they assassinated many moderate political figures. Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931 and established the puppet state of Manchuguo in 1934. An attempted military coup in 1936 failed in its immediate objectives but led to the establishment of martial law, under which the Showa emperor (Hirohito; reigned 1926–89) became a pawn of the ultranationalists. An invasion and military takeover of eastern China in 1937 was seen as the first step in the creation of a “Greater East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere,” designed to unite Asia under Japanese control. In 1940 Japan entered the Tripartite Alliance with Italy and Nazi Germany. Japan occupied French Indochina in June 1941, provoking increased Allied resistance to Japanese imperial ambitions. Gen. Hideki Tojo became prime minister in Oct. 1941 and ordered simultaneous preemptive strikes against Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, and Malaya on Dec. 7–8. By mid 1942, Japan controlled most of Southeast Asia and the western Pacific, but American victories at the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942 and the Battle of Midway in June 1942 halted Japanese expansion. Thereafter, Japanese forces were steadily pushed back in “island-hopping” campaigns in the central Pacific and along the western Pacific rim, and by Allied counterattacks in Burma. Air attacks on Japan itself culminated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Following Japan's formal surrender on Sept. 2, 1945, an American army in Japan under Gen. Douglas MacArthur took control of the country. A new constitution was promulgated, relegating the emperor to purely symbolic status, renouncing the use of military force, and guaranteeing the civil rights of citizens. The industrial combines that had lent strength to Japan's empire were partially dismantled. An international tribunal tried many wartime leaders as war criminals in 1948. In 1949 considerable authority was returned to the conservative government of Premier Shigeru Yoshida. Japan served as a base for American forces during the Korean War, 1950–53, greatly accelerating Japan's postwar economic recovery. On Apr. 28, 1952, a peace treaty between Japan and the United States went into effect, ending the Occupation. On Mar. 8, 1954, the two nations signed a mutual defense assistance pact. Japan was admitted to the United Nations in 1956. The success of Japan's postwar recovery was symbolized by the Tokyo Olympic Games of 1964 and Expo '70 at Osaka. Violent student-protest movements in 1968–69 had no clear political goals and no lasting effect. Politically stable under an unbroken succession of Liberal Democratic party governments, Japan emerged as a major and steadily expanding world industrial power. In general, Japan has been reluctant to play an international political role consistent with its vast economic power. From the mid-1970's onward, the balance of trade between Japan and the U.S. has weighed heavily in Japan's favor, leading to strains in U.S.-Japan relations and American charges that Japan engages in unfair trade practices. Several times during the 1980's and 1990's, especially when the yen was appreciating rapidly against the dollar, Japan pledged to take measures to even the trade balance by improving foreign access to Japan's domestic economy. Domestically, Japan in the 1980's enjoyed a very high standard of living, marred by the extremely high cost and relatively low quality of housing, and by underinvestment in the public infrastructure. A real estate boom led prices of commercial property in downtown Tokyo to increase as much as 200-fold in the span of a decade. This boom extended to the United States, where the rapidly declining dollar made Japanese investment in the United States especially attractive. For most of its postwar history, Japan has been essentially a one-party state, run by political professionals of the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) according to a system of consensus. But by the end of the 1980's, the system started to crumble as the regime's widespread corruption was revealed. Prime Minister Noburu Takeshita was force to resign in May 1989 after a bribery scandal. His successor, Sousuke Uno, lasted only two months before resigning in a scandal over his sexual conduct. Public opinion turned sharply against the LDP, which lost control of the upper house of the Diet in July 1989 elections; the Socialist party, led by Takako Doi, posted significant gains. Uno's successor, Toshiki Kaifu, emerged as an unexpectedly skillful leader who enhanced Japan's international reputation by offering aid to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and by pledging billions of dollars to support the Persian Gulf War. In Oct. 1991, Kaifu was replaced as LDP chairman by Kiichi Miyazawa, who succeeded in passing legislation authorizing the posting abroad of Japanese troops—for the first time since World War II—for peacekeeping missions in noncombat roles. An economic slump and political scandals continued to buffet the LDP throughout 1992 and 1993. LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru and other party officials resigned after admitting ties to gangsters. The LDP was forced from office in 1993 for the first time in 38 years, and formed successive coalition governments with the Socialist Party and other parties. The weak coalition governments paved the way for a LDP return to power in 1994; the years since have brought continued economic stagnation, bank failures, scandals involving government and business ties to organized crime, and general malaise. The city of Kobe was hit by a severe earthquake in January, 1995; the government was criticized for inneffective rescue and relief efforts. The country's confidence was further shaken in March, 1995, by a bizarre attack with poison gas in the Tokyo subway, perpetrated by a religious cult, Aum Shinrikyo. Its leader, Shoko Asahara, was eventually arrested and convicted of murder. Several instances of violent crime involving U.S. servicemen in Okinawa led Pres. Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto to sign an agreement in April, 1996, reducing the number of American bases in Okinawa. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, first elected in Jan. 1996, was re-elected leader of the LDP in Sept., 1997. But the Asian economic crisis took a toll on Japan, still in the midst of a long-term recession. In the spring of 1998 a plunge in the value of the yen doomed the Hashimoto government; he resigned and was replaced by party stalwart, Keizo Obuchi. In 1999 Japan's economy rebounded slightly as the Obuchi government tried desperately to raise the levels of spending throughout the economy. In April 2000, Premier Obuchi suffered a stroke. His successor Yoshiro Mori led the Liberal Democrats to a near majority in parliamentary elections June 25, forming a coalition government with New Komeito and the Conservatives (a new party, composed of former Liberals). With Mori's resignation in April 2001, the Liberal Democrats (operating under new party rules) selected as their leader, and the lower house named as Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, a man outside the old party “factions” and promising modernizing liberal economic reforms. Japan's economy grew worse during 2001 and 2002, but rebounded slightly in 2003.

But whether it's because I've lived in New York City for the past 11 years or simply because I love flavors characteristic of other cuisines -- cilantro, ginger and saffron, for example -- I find I'm always fooling around with the recipes handed down from my mother and grandmothers. I don't think it's so terrible to muck with tradition. Besides, it's difficult to create an authentic regional dish if you aren't actually in that region. (Sure, you can make a good coq au vin in Milwaukee. But it won't taste like the one you made in cooking school in Burgundy.) I can't even    get    self-rising flour here, so my biscuits, for example, are already destined to taste different from those of my forebears. So it doesn't feel so dishonest to spread them with chevre butter before layering on the Smithfield ham.   Biscuits aside, I can't recreate most of the dishes my mother made because I simply don't have the time -- everyone knows that real Southern cooked greens have to simmer for about half a day, long enough to make the kitchen smell really funky. My adaptations include undercooked or raw greens (what my father calls Yankee vegetables), lots of garlic, certain ingredients that I didn't grow up with at all -- like fresh fennel -- and desserts that aren't even half as sweet as the chess pies and pralines of my youth. What results is a meal that is just as satisfying as the genuine Southern article, but which suits my life style and my taste buds better.

Several walking tours with such themes as the romantic revival, the gaslight era and the cotton era will cost $12 a person, and a town-and-country tour that will take visitors to stately homes along the Skidaway River will cost $18 including transportation. Each evening, for $10 a person, wine and hors d'oeuvres will be served in a different square, followed by a visit to one of the city's house museums. On the final night dinner will be served in the Green-Meldrim House. That event, called a 19th-century evening, will cost $25 a person. FAIR WEATHER AHEAD","excerpt":"Southern Tours of Homes and Gardens"},{"year":"1955","title":"HAMILTON BASSO'S novel, \\"The View From Pompey's Head,\\" which had a considerable popularity on its publication a year ago, told a rather extensive story of a New York lawyer's return to the southern town where he was reared and where, he discovered, he still had deep-running roots. But the movie version of it, which Philip Dunne has made for Twentieth Century-Fox and which opened at the Roxy yesterday, is concerned with only the two main complications met by the gentleman in his old home town.The first is the curious resistance he encounters when he tries to investigate a mystery involving the diversion of funds from the royalties of an aging author who lives in the town. And the second is his affecting reunion with an old girl friend who is now richly wed to the community's most successful upstart but is still carrying the torch for him.In a casual and leisurely fashion that is probably intended to convey the mood of torpor and exhaustion prevailing in the town, Mr. Dunne, as the director of his own script, tackles these issues dutifully. And he has his man get them both behind him and off to New York in a couple of days, which is good time, indeed, for the settling of two such imposing affairs.The first is the more intriguing, from the casual observer's point of view, since it does have an element of strange concealment and a surprise dénouément for those who do not know the book. It also permits the presentation of the most interesting character in the tale—that of a proud Southern lady, played by Marjorie Rambeau.This lady, whose sense of class distinction and tradition is so strong that she attempts a barefaced and shameful deception to conceal a surprising truth, represents in the scheme of Mr. Basso—or, at least, of Mr. Dunne—the pathos of ancestor worship that seems to be the cardinal sin in this film. It may be a sin, but the evidence is Weakly assembled here. Miss Rambeau gives a very good performance, and our sympathies went out to her.That may be, too, because Richard Egan, who plays the home-coming man, and Dana Wynter, who plays his old sweetheart, are by contrast provokingly sullen and dull. Mr. Egan walks through the picture with the air of an automaton, and Miss Wynter, who is pretty but that's all, carries her troubles as though they were in a basket on her head.The ultimate expression of their dullness comes when Mr. Egan flatly states — at the point where they realize, though both married, that they are madly in love—\\"We have got a problem.\\" They have, indeed. And so had Mr. Dunne.It is rather a relief when Miss Wynter decides that she would rather continue to live in her old family mansion with her crude husband than have Mr. Egan. Her decision is logical.Others participating in this fable of southern subterfuge are Cameron Mitchell as the whisky-drinking upstart, Sidney Blackmer as the author (made to look like Ernest Hemingway, not William Faulkner) and Dorothy Patrick Davis as Mr. Egan's dull wife.There are some good genuine southern scenes, however, in color and CinemaScope, most of them made at Brunswick, Ga. They'll make a southern exile sick for \\"down home.\\" 'View From Pompey's Head' Has Debut","excerpt":"Southern Town Stars in Film at Roxy"},{"year":"1926","title":"ANOTHER LARGE COTTON CROP THOUGHT POSSIBLE","excerpt":"Southern Trade Discussing the Chance of Repeating Last Year's Experience."},{"year":"1929","title":"NEW ORLEANS, La., Sept. 15.-- The main feature in last week's cotton market was the government's forecast of the cotton yield this season, based on conditions prevailing on Sept. 1.
