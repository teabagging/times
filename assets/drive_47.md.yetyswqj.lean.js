The winner also receives a matching dream doghouse, a new GMC Yukon and $250,000 in cash.    9 P.M. (Starz) BEWITCHED -- (2005). The casting is inspired: Nicole Kidman (above left) as Samantha the reluctant witch","excerpt":"Will Ferrell as her slightly goofy mortal husband, Darren; and Shirley MacLaine as her disapproving mother, Endora. The premise is clever: Hollywood is doing a remake of the television series, but they've accidentally hired a real witch. And this movie still doesn't work.    10 P.M. (Sundance) TREES LOUNGE -- (1996). Sometimes a well-meaning adult isn't just going through a rough patch. Steve Buscemi wrote, directed and stars in this painfully sad film about an unemployed car mechanic whose life really is going downhill fast, with no reversal in sight.    10 P.M. (IFC) THE HENRY ROLLINS SHOW -- Mr. Rollins puts Bill Maher (right), of HBO's ''Real Time With Bill Maher,'' in the talk-show guest's seat. The musical guest is Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the Los Angeles-based band that has been compared to, among others, the Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, early Oasis and Lou Reed.    4:30 A.M. (TCM) DANCING LADY -- (1933). And here we have Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in a musical. She's Janie Barlow, an aspiring dancer reduced to burlesque houses. He's Patch Gallagher, a charming, financially struggling Broadway producer. Franchot Tone is a rich guy who wants Janie and manages to get her a part in Patch's latest show. Guess which guy Janie likes best. Fred Astaire turns up in a very small role and does a big number, ''Let's Go Bavarian.''
