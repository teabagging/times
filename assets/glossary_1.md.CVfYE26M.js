So who does one blame? Why, naturally, the media, by which is mainly meant television.   In the interpretation that Vice President Dan Quayle advanced last Sunday on \\"Face the Nation,\\" as he was ducking Lesley Stahl's questions about Mr. Bush's changeability on the budget, much of the Administration's problem can be traced to the way Washington correspondents have been reporting the story; if only they got it right, the American People would understand that the President is consistency itself with no special solicitude for the rich.   How much of the blame or credit has television earned for the President's slippage? Not, in this viewer's estimate, all that much. Despite the reputation for liberal leanings of journalists in Washington and New York, they have proven themselves willing to pick on all residents of the White House, whatever the party label. (If John F. Kennedy got off easy, he owed it more to his camera-friendly style than to his politics.) Skepticism is in the nature of the job, and the President exists to be the national target for praise and censure. More often than not, however, journalists, like politicians, take their lead from the public. They pick up on inchoate dissatisfactions and then feed them back in a form that both confirms and exacerbates.   In the two issues that are now confounding the nation - the standoff on the budget and the facedown in the Middle East - television news was far from hasty in criticizing the White House. Quite the contrary. In the first days and weeks of the movement of American troops into Saudi Arabia, the emphasis was all on the nastiness of Saddam Hussein and Washington's brilliant success in rallying so many members of the United Nations against him. Mr. Bush was the hero of the hour, although he did not share credit with the media for his good marks in the polls.   The camera's concentration on the young Americans in the desert may have subdued public enthusiasm by bringing home to viewers the realization that these fresh-faced soldiers would be the first to die should war break out. But it was inevitable that as the weeks wore on, support for the exercise would wear down, and questions that went unasked in the first flush of patriotism would be heard. Officials on talk shows, compelled to react to inklings of impatience, as well as to President Hussein's threats of destruction, boasts of defiance, hints of compromise, began to seem vague and wishful.   It was also the President's bad luck that the effects of America's deployment in the Gulf were felt instantly in the form of higher gasoline prices. Here was another story that was made for television. Day after day, the news cameras were directed at the ever-rising figures on the pumps. Could the prices have gone up any faster, some viewers must have begun asking, if Iraq had been left to take over Kuwait? Was Kuwait worth $10 or $20 a week? Soon, the television stories about the misfortunes of Kuwaitis began to be accompanied by stories about the wealth and power of the country's ruling family.   To Mr. Bush's further misfortune, the already worrisome economic outlook, darkened by uncertainty in the Middle East, was brought to the center of attention by the budget fiasco. But here again, the television news programs and talk shows by no means leaped on the President early in the process. The negotiations were so secretive, the politicians so reticent that correspondents had trouble getting a line on what was happening; there was not much disposition to lay blame on anyone.   It was only after the weeks of negotiating came to nothing and the public exploded that network newshounds scented blood and headed yelping toward the White House. These days, anchors and correspondents permit themselves to refer to the President's flipflopping as an accepted fact rather than attributing it to some Democrat. Television started nothing, but it picked up fast on the national mood, just like the Democrats in Congress. That comes naturally to a mass medium, which is nourished by its umbilical link to its audience.   So to get back to those polls, Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle are kidding themselves if they think they have been cooked by the tube. The television tube is a great reflector that catches the nation's passions and sends them back in brighter and hotter hues. Should a deal be struck on the budget or with Iraq, the President's curve will doubtless go up again, and he can count on being treated better on the airwaves.   The criticisms of the budget finaglings now heard on television and the developing sense of unease over Iraq in the nightly reports may have taken away a couple of points from the President's popularity, but for the root of the decline, he will have to look to the real world, to his own actions and to the American People.

How&#8208","excerpt":"to books being popular these days what about a compendium of how to play over 400 sports? Consider it done sports fans. It's called &#8220;Rules of the Game&#8221; and will be published in October as the joint venture of a New York&#8208;based publishing service called Two Continents, a London publisher of books for the American market called Paddington Press and another London editorialdesign firm called The Diagram Group. &#8220;Rules of the Game&#8221; was conceived by The Diagram Group, which had heretofore specialized in book graphics but hankered after doing complete books. A book on how to play all the world's major competitive games was one project they had simmering on the back burner. The hitch was, as it usually is, money, so now enter Paddington Press. This was founded about two years ago by John and Janet Marqusee, two Americans who fled the United States with their seven children for the supposed ampler amenities of London. The Marqusees and The Diagram Group got together and the &#8220;Rules of the Game&#8221; project came alive. A team of editorial people was formed under Ruth Midgley, the 28&#8208;year&#8208;old managing editor, and they began collating the material collected by correspondence with sports committees the world over, representing over 2,000 replies from 21 countries. The task was to compress and simplify (and sometimes translate) pages and pages of tediously detailed rule books. The result will be several pages of simplified explanation of each sport (some sports require one page, some as many as six), accompanied by illustrations of players in action. Asked what was the most complicated sport, Miss Midgley readily replied, &#8220;Ice hockey.&#8221; The only sport that did not have any written rules turned out to be that old pub stand&#8208;by, darts; Miss Midgley's team codified the rules gleaned from oral tradition and received the Imprimatur of the sport's adepts in England. The book includes all those exotic Olympic sports such as whitewater canoeing, as well as dorfball (a Dutch basketball&#8208;type game which requires teams made up of six men awl six women), canoe polo, kendo and sled&#8208;dog, pigeon and kayak racing. The next link in the publishing chain was Two Continents, a publishing service rather than a publisher, which takes a book in any stage from MS. to final book and produces, distributes, publicizes, handles accounts, etc.&#8212;in short what a publisher does, except that the author pays the costs, plus an administrative fee, and receives something like 70 per cent of the monetary returns, plus all subsidiary&#8208;rights money. Two Continents, founded by Leonard Shatzkin, a veteran sales and production man, performs the bulk of its work for foreign publishers who want to publish in the United States or paperback publishers wishing to bring out a hardcover edition of an original title. &#8220;Rules of the Game&#8221; has a 100,000&#8208;copy first printing, 30,000 of which has already been ordered for Australia.

It is a simple statement of purpose, a simple statement of theme. In its simplicity and in the artful simplicity of its production, it is a poetic, stirring and majestic picture. The old words have been too freely used","excerpt":"to call it \\"epic\\" in Hollywood's presence implies an ignorance of laudable superlatives. But we employ the word in the pre-Goldwyn sense, and \\"The River\\" is an epic—an epic of the great brown giant that served man and rose against him when he betrayed it.It is the story of neglect and ignorance and greed, of cotton land milked dry, of ruthless timber cutting, of earth scarred by the miners of coal and iron. It is the story of the river's rebellion, of floods and erosion and the desolate wasting of the land. And it is the story, still in its first chapters, of reforestation, scientific land cultivation, of dams and power plants and model homes. It is the story of the Mississippi as told by a modern realist, not by an Edna Ferber in romantic salute to a romantic past.And Mr. Lorentz has told its story well. His film is more impressive photographically than his \\"Plow That Broke the Plains\\" of last year. Virgil Thomson's score, a symphonic blend of old spirituals, folk ballads and original music, has matched the images perfectly. Mr. Lorentz's narrative, spoken by Thomas Chalmers, has the rhythmic cadence of flowing water. We cannot resist quoting one of its passages:From as far West as Idaho, Down from the glacier peaks of the Rockies;From as far East as Pennsylvania, Down from the turkey ridges of the Alleghanies;Down from Minnesota, twenty-five hundred miles, The Mississippi River runs to the Gulf.Carrying every drop of water that flows down two-thirds of the continent;Carrying every brook and rill, Rivulet and creek—Carrying all the rivers that run down two-thirds of the continent—The Mississippi runs to the Gulf of Mexico.Down the Yellowstone, the Milk, the White and the Cheyenne;The Cannonball, the Musselshell, the James and the Sioux;Down the Judity, the Grand, the Osage and the Platte;The Skunk, the Salt, the Black and Minnesota;Down the Rock, the Illinois and the Kankakee,The Allegheny, the Monongahela, Kanawha and Muskingum;Down the Miami, the Wabash, the Licking and the Green,The Cumberland, the Kentucky and the Tennessee;Down the Ouchita, the Wichita, the Red and Yazoo;Down the Missouri three thousand miles from the Rockies;Down the Ohio a thousand miles from the Alleghenies;Down the Arkansas fifteen hundred miles from the Great Divide;Down the Red, a thousand miles from Texas;Down the great Valley, twenty-five hundred miles from Minnesota;Carrying every rivulet and brook, creek and rill,Carrying all the rivers that run down two-thirds of the continent,The Mississippi runs to the Gulf.Prose like that, accompanied by pictures like those his camera crew have obtained and by Mr. Thomson's eloquent score, places \\"The River\\" at the top of American documentaries; challenges the best the international documentarians have done. Not even a Supreme Court decision could stay us from calling this New Deal venture one of the finest films ever made.The fictional half of the Criterion's bill is filled by a well-wrought B-plus melodrama from Paramount, an entertaining tidbit called \\"Scandal Street,\\" which considers, for the 'steenth time, the cruelty, malice and stupidity of small-town gossips. Here it is Louise Campbell who suffers the tongue-lashing and the guilty-until-proved-innocent attitude of Peach-tree Lane's residents when the married Don Juan in the next-door house is found murdered. Fortunately, she has wee Virginia Weidler on her side, as well as right, and the murder outs conveniently.As small-town profiles go, this is as definitive as the next, with penetrating sidelights on the weekly bridge nights, the children's dancing school, amours and civic pride.

Six letter writers and the editor attributed it to eight of the usual suspects: George S. Kaufman, Dorothy Parker, Alexander Woollcott, Howard Dietz, Robert Benchley, Ilka Chase, Tallulah Bankhead's husband and Goodman Ace. In another letter in the same issue we found the poet Anthony Hecht upbraiding the novelist Alison Lurie for failing to notice a light-fingered borrowing by the novelist Peter Ackroyd from the poet Wordsworth about some sentimental mist glittering over some plashy earth. This is also missing from Bartlett's -- though the new edition has finally caught up with Evelyn Waugh's far more important plashitude: \\"Feather-footed through the plashy fen passes the questing vole.\\"   Pity the editors of any familiar quotations volume. The culture moves so fast these days. Who knows whose bons mots will be borrowed, twisted, misremembered and misattributed in next week's Book Review? John Bartlett himself, having begun in 1855 with the essential smattering of Bible, Shakespeare and mostly English stalwarts, went through nine editions in his lifetime without ever awakening to his contemporaries Whitman, Thoreau or Melville. Today editors have to keep their fingers more tightly on the pulse. Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley have become ancient sages","excerpt":"to capture the words now on our lips and pens, the new edition has felt obliged to canonize less venerable authors like the Doors (\\"Come on, baby, light my fire\\"), \\"Sesame Street\\" (\\"Me want cookie!\\") and Monty Python's Flying Circus (\\"This parrot is no more. It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker. This is a late parrot. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daisies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot\\").

It gets by, but without distinction.Whether this feeling will be shared by those who failed to see the show in its original form is more than we can say, Perhaps they will accept Mr. Ruggles as the very Moonface Martin the authors had in mind. But we were unable—in spite of our most charitable intentions—to avoid making invidious comparisons between Mr. Ruggles's efforts to prove his gunmettle by using \\"dis\\" and \\"dat\\" and Mr. Moore's completely hilarious reliance on a tremendous (and entirely unmenacing) scowl, the wistful note that crept into his voice whenever he spoke of Public Enemy No. 1 and the obvious fact that he really was a harmless little fellow for all his machine gun toting. Mr. Ruggles has caught none of that.Otherwise (but what a huge deficit to overcome!) Paramount has done rather well by \\"Anything Goes.\\" Ethel Merman has been brought over from the original cast to sing \\"I Get a Kick Out of You,\\" just as Mr. Porter meant her to, and Bing Crosby is an acceptable substitute for the show's William Gaxton in almost every subdivision except that in which he joins Miss Merman in \\"You're the Top.\\" It doesn't seem possible, but Mr. Crosby croons it. Other assets notable are the preservation of Mr. Porter's score and the addition of a few new numbers, a Chinese extravaganza and a night club sequence, both presenting Miss Merman, happily.

However, what Mr. Howe terms strikebreaking is in actuality an attempt to continue business in the face of odds that would be far shorter without the acts of violence committed by strikers.    Disruption of the paper's cash flow (primarily stemming from advertising revenues) would raise the possibility that employees would need to make concessions along the lines of those recently accepted by New York Post employees to insure that their jobs continued to exist.

Neither cooking teachers nor cookbook authors seem to suggest that some would-be cooks are temperamentally unsuited for the task or that different personalities may lend themselves to different types of food preparation.   ''We only do well the things we love doing,'' Colette wrote about cooking, and I suspect that though there are some men and women who hate to cook, many who think they dislike the task have simply not found the kind they enjoy.   It is a good idea for beginners to try all types of cooking and baking to determine which dishes and techniques they have a feeling for. But once you have established, for example, that you simply do not have the patience or knack for intricate handwork, it is best to give up trying to produce dishes requiring the ability -let us say a truffled galantine or paupiettes of veal that require pounding, filling, rolling and stitching.

In 1976 Congress, noting that changes now occur more rapidly than in the past, enacted a law to provide an additional census at middecade beginning in 1985 - one not so elaborate as that falling at the beginning of each 10-year period, but one that would supply enough detailed information about population changes and characteristics to tide the census users over until the next full head count.

Mrs. Bragdon implies that the first Adams was a Pilgrim and that he received a   grant of land from Charles I. She associates  the Massachusetts Circular Letter of 1768 with the  Stamp Act.  She confuses Thomas Pinck&#8209; ney, a 1796 Vice Presidential candidate, with the C. C. Pinckney, his brother, who was also a candidate for the   Vice Presi dency in 1796 and 1800, and ran for the Presidency   in 1804 and 1808. She attributes the population growth of 1809-17 to a great influx of immigration, when in fact only about 100,000 immigrants entered the country in that period, some 5 per cent of the total expansion.

As an infant, William S. Burroughs saw tiny men romping among his alphabet blocks. The inventor Nikola Tesla feared women who wore pearl earrings and, like Howard Hughes, was so frightened of germs that he avoided shaking hands. The stories of these and 60 other eccentrics are set out by Carl A. Posey, a novelist and an editor at Time-Life Books, in THE BIG BOOK OF WEIRDOS (Paradox Press/ DC Comics, paper, $12.95) and illustrated, in black and white, by 63 graphic artists. The weirdos in question can be as benign as Stephen Tennant, the languid English professional beauty who spent many of his last years in bed, visited by the rich and famous, or as malign as Hitler. Among lesser-known figures, my personal favorite is Cyrus R. Teed, who, around the turn of the century, founded a religious community on the belief that the earth was actually a gold-plated sphere, and that, to quote his motto, \\"We live inside.\\" Mr. Posey's dialogue is often flippant -- \\"Terrible? Moi?\\" says Ivan -- and frequently funny, in a silly sort of way. The graphics are as various as their subjects, ranging from pastiche (Van Gogh) to near-abstraction (King Farouk).

No conversion is necessary. All bottles - and cans - are returnable.  In Michigan, after five years of mandatory deposits on beverage containers, most imported beers are still available. They arrive in their usual throwaway containers, go through the usual deposit process and are finally sold by the distributor for recycling as scrap aluminum or glass cullet. Indeed, that is what happens to most American beer containers as well.  Therein lies the basic problem with Michigan's ''bottle bill.'' There was little shift from one-way bottles and cans to re-usable (i.e., refillable) bottles, and hence there were few concomitant container-cost savings. All the added retail and wholesale handling costs were, on the other hand, passed on in higher prices. The result has been a tremendous reduction in beverage-container litter but at a tremendous cost to consumers of beer and soft drinks (something like $20 per Michigander per year).","excerpt":"TO CUT BOTTLE LAWS' COST TO CONSUMERS"},{"year":"1935","title":"Divd","excerpt":"to cut capital expenditures P.R.R. to Curb Expenditures This Year; Pittsburgh Line Electrification Shelved"},{"year":"1955","title":"NY County Com sets meeting to revise rules","excerpt":"to cut county com size from 5,000 to 2,500 as required by '54 election laws; plans no change in election of AD leaders REPUBLICANS CALLED TO PARE COUNTY UNIT"},{"year":"1938","title":"Annual meeting","excerpt":"to cut divds NATIONAL POWER TO CUT DIVIDENDS; President Sawyer Says Conditions Call for Reduction"},{"year":"1937","title":"E L James recalls success of monetary moves STABILIZATION OF FRANC RAISES POLITICAL ISSUE","excerpt":"To Cut Down Expenses Premier Blum Must Trim 'New-Deal' Projects Of the Popular Front GOLD FOR PAPER TOMORROW New Loan Proposed Success Not Yet Certain Future of the Franc What M.

The fact is I think he would have left us a punchier quotation without the first five words, but no editor stepped in to make it read ''I am a verb . . . .'' Even so, Grant's self-identification with a verb showed he understood the essence of that part of speech: action. No verb, no plot. You just sit and plan, like Gen. George B. McClellan.  After a short period of decline, while wishy-washy writers in passive voices lolled around in dull, bureaucratic constructions (''the program was implemented''), the verb is back with a vengeance. Sixty-second managers shift to the active voice to snap, ''Implement this,'' and their bosses, two-second managers, bark a gutsier action word: ''Do that!'' The superboss, or split-second manager, says, ''Dotted-line the responsibility to him, and straight-line the reporting to the other guy.''   Huh? A dotted-line denotes a non-hierarchical relationship, as between two executives in the same echelon or on different levels exchanging information rather than direction, but a vogue verb in executive suites is ''to dotted-line it,'' which is a verb meaning ''tell him, but it's not an order.''
