After serving in the Army during World War II and making (only!) one parachute jump that she never tired recounting the horrors of, Helen fled her frigid New England roots for the infinitely more cosmopolitan and romantic surroundings of her beloved New York City. She led a successful and varied career in the media and the fashion world, working as a researcher and interviewer for The New Yorker and NBC's ''Today Show'' and ''The Tex & Jinx Show.'' She later served as director of public relations for Best & Co., Franklin-Simon and Lord & Taylor. For most of the 1960s, she was a principal in her own firm with partner and former supermodel Muriel Maxwell, directing the promotional efforts of such designers and accounts as James Galanos, Arnold Scaasi, Kislav Gloves, London Fog and Marcel Rochas. She also served as Fashion Editor for American Weekly, where she worked extensively with leading fashion photographer (and lifelong friend) J. Frederick Smith. She was married for more than 40 years to renowned Japanologist and Columbia University professor Herbert Passin, who pre-deceased her in 2003. It was from the couple's extraordinary Garment Center penthouse loft in the shadow of the Empire State Building that Helen truly established her credentials as an entertainer, friend and mentor to the famous, would-be famous and not-so-famous. With the ease and dexterity of a bartender at the Ritz, she mixed brilliant academics with sixfoot tall fashion models, and futurologists like Herman Kahn and writers like Leo Rosten with musicians, vagabonds, journalists, visiting professors, earnest young graduate students and even, occasionally, impoverished undergrads. It was always a combination of refined elegance and down-to-earth humor. In the process, Helen took many friends, both young and old, under her wing, dispensing advice, wisdom and -- always -- strong opinions wherever she went. When the Passins later moved their base to a sprawling apartment in Morningside Heights, the views of Manhattan may have suffered, but not the personal and family friendships. A large group of admirers gathered there one last time this past week to toast her extraordinary life. She is survived by a son, Scott Latham","excerpt":"three step-children, John Latham, Katharine Butler and Tom Passin; and five grandchildren, Victoria Latham, and James, Laura and Mark Passin, and Luke Butler.

Many said that the most recent figures pointed to a recession deeper and more prolonged than they had expected. New factory orders for durable goods in November fell 10.5 percent, matching January's record decline. These include the orders for aircraft, automobiles, machinery, metals and computers that nourish the economy for months, or sometimes years. A broader forward-looking index, the leading economic indicators, dropped for the fifth straight month in November, falling 1.2 percent","excerpt":"three straight declines are usually enough to signal a recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of business cycles, confirmed that a recession probably began between June and September. Economists are watching the Middle East, the banks and consumers to see how severe the slump will be. High consumer debt and low confidence are likely to aggravate the slowdown, many say. \\"If Sam Kahan doesn't know whether he's going to have a job in 1991, he's going to tell the kids 'No more Nintendo games,' \\" Mr. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities, said. Middle East peace would give consumers heart, he said, adding that his children remain optimistic that at least one economist will do all right. \\"They figure dad is always good for another buck,\\" he said.  More Taxes on the Toast  The party's over on Dec. 31 as far as the Government and the liquor stores are concerned. A one-time tax, expected to generate $300 million, is being imposed on wholesale and retail liquor inventories held on that date. Higher excise taxes take effect with the New Year. The excise taxes should add only pennies to the price of a bottle or can of beer, wine or spirits; the tax on a bottle of 80-proof whiskey goes from $1.98 to $2.14. But just as every tremor in the Middle East seems to produce an earthquake at the local filling station, the liquor tax hikes might be amplified and redoubled. Many big American brewers and French and Italian winemakers are seizing the chance to raise prices. Wholesalers and retailers will then add their own markups. Some merchants say a $2 tax increase per case could mean $10 more in the store. Less Action At the Stores  For the nation's retailers, it was almost as if the doldrums and discounts of July had arrived in December. A chronically optimistic bunch, they were nevertheless frankly downcast about this year's Christmas results -- the worst season in years, they said. Some retailers reported last week that sales had dropped from the year before; factoring in inflation, most appeared to have suffered real declines. Shoppers neglected to swarm into the stores at the last minute, as they had done in previous years. The stores usually earn about half their annual profits between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Analysts say that price-cutting, continuing slack sales and weak balance sheets might force more chains into bankruptcy court. A few privileged retailers did report higher sales from customers who were rushing to beat the new 10 percent Federal luxury tax. That levy takes effect on New Year's Day, making very expensive cars, boats, jewelry, furs and private planes that much more difficult to afford. Trouble in the California Freeze  When the parade floats for the Tournament of Roses can't get enough flowers, California must really be in trouble. The state's worst winter freeze in more than half a century has wilted the flower crop and also promised to raise fruit and vegetable prices around the nation. A box of California navel oranges at local produce markets shot up to $22 last week from $12 the week before. Considerably higher prices are likely to spread toward the East over the coming days and weeks. COMPANIES   Drexel Still Pays  The patient might be in a terminal coma, at best a vegetative state, but the continuing treatment remains excruciatingly expensive. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection May 29, but it is still paying two officers $1.45 million a year each, and $21.1 million to the 73 officers still on the payroll. Frederick H. Joseph, the firm's former chief executive and now vice chairman, has to make do with $450,000. Drexel executives speak of the need to pay competitive rates to keep talented people with the firm; creditors say Drexel is depleting its estate with no chance of being revived. Icahn Moves In on Pan Am  The letters and news leaks and telephone calls flew thicker than the Northeast's snow between Carl C. Icahn and Pan Am last week.  Mr. Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines, added more tangles and twists to his offer to buy Pan American World Airways. First, he sent a tough letter warning Thomas G. Plaskett, the Pan Am chairman, not to sell his Northeast shuttle. Then, through an anonymous but talkative aide, he demanded Mr. Plaskett's ouster. Mr. Icahn, who proposed buying Pan Am for $375 million in mid-December, is expected to make a formal offer in the next several days. Pan Am is desperately searching for help as the slow winter season arrives and its cash supplies dwindle. Japan's Protective Instincts  Maybe, as the United States Treasury Department insists, the Japanese Government really does give unfair breaks to domestic banks and brokerages. Japan's Finance Ministry has quietly begun investigating whether Japanese investment firms pressured two Japanese companies into dropping their deal for Salomon Brothers to issue bonds. A leading executive at Nomura Securities, Japan's largest broker, compared Salomon's entry to \\"exporting AIDS from Wall Street.\\" INTERNATIONAL   Russia's Latest Split  Gorbachev is veering to the right, Yeltsin is staying on the left and a chasm opened last week in the middle. The Russian republic's Parliament, urged on by its President, Boris N. Yeltsin, voted Wednesday night to reduce its contribution to the central Soviet budget by more than 90 percent. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told his own legislature that the confrontation threatens economic collapse. \\"This would mean the breakup not only of the economy, but of the Soviet Union,\\" he said. Meanwhile, Mr. Gorbachev won the lawmakers' approval of Gennadi I. Yanayev as Vice President only after they initially turned the nomination down. Michael Mandelbaum, director of the Project on East-West relations for the Council on Foreign Relations, called the split inevitable once the republic adopted a free-market plan that Mr. Gorbachev spurned. \\"There is no way to have serious economic reform in the Russian republic without a constitutional confrontation,\\" Dr. Mandelbaum said. \\" What they are saying is, 'We the Russian people are not going to let this corrupt machine take our money anymore.' \\" Vineyards Safe and Sound  As 1990 ends, the French village of Chateauneuf-du-Pape can raise a glass of its earthy red wine to one of the most successful examples of government regulation to encourage commerce. In 1954, the village council passed a law forbidding flying saucers -- flying cigars in French parlance -- from landing, fearing they would crush precious grapes. Any that did arrive were to be immediately impounded. Again this year, no saucers or cigars touched down in Chateauneuf-du-Pape, and the vineyards were safe. No word on whether, come 1992, saucers from within the European Community will be allowed in.

One is Jerry Machlin of Silver Spring, Md., who is not totally retired","excerpt":"three weeks ago he was in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where he directed the Prague Cup. The other is Harry Goldwater, who celebrates his 90th birthday today at his home in Manhattan.   They both have happy recollections of the diagramed deal from a light-hearted rubber-bridge game in which they were partners against two other directors. Goldwater played brilliantly for the declarer and the defense -- and he happened to be dummy at the time.  Suspicious Look From West       Machlin found himself in five diamonds doubled after his opponents had bid to four hearts. West led the heart king and inspected the dummy carefully, considering his lead to the second trick.    As all the players knew very well, the laws of the game require dummy to remain dumb except in some specific situations. Nevertheless, they do not categorically bar the dummy from giving advice to his opponents, and Goldwater took advantage of this oversight.    \\"You'd better play another heart,\\" he urged West, \\"and shorten the dummy's trumps.\\"    West, who had a heart half out of his hand, gave Goldwater a suspicious look and put it back.    \\"A trump would probably be O.K.,\\" added Goldwater, \\"but whatever you do, don't play a spade.\\"    After this advice from dummy, West knew exactly what to do. He led a spade, and East scowled.    Goldwater had already achieved the rare feat of leading someone astray by giving him sensible advice. All that remained was for him to find the winning play for his partner.    South played the spade nine from the dummy and captured East's queen with the ace. He then led the diamond queen, although the jack would have been slightly better for psychological reasons.  Obeying Dummy's Orders     When dummy's ace captured West's king, it was time for Goldwater to resume his \\"I can see through the back of the cards\\" act.    \\"Finesse the nine on the way back,\\" he recommended, and Machlin obeyed orders, thus gathering in East's trumps. On a more serious occasion the opponents would have objected to this gross violation of the law, but they did no more than raise eyebrows.    It was then an easy matter to develop spades and make the doubled contract. This entitled Goldwater to an award as the best dummy player of all time, but his psychic powers would have been tested severely if West had adopted Goldwater's first suggestion, and even more if the original opening lead had been a club.

For Westerners his music may offer the easiest approach to West African rock, with its thumping funk beat, horn riffs and lilting keyboard hooks. And for the appreciative West Africans who shouted, ululated and applauded certain lyrics when Mr. Kante performed at S.O.B.'s on Thursday night, there's still enough of Africa in the music to make it their own. Mr. Kante sings with the strong, sailing tenor voice of a griot, and while the music that surrounds him is Westernized, his vocal lines still have the urgency and off-the-beat phrasing of Mandingo traditional music.      Mr. Kante's 14-piece band -- with members from Guinea, Senegal, Sweden, Paris and Los Angeles -- is a song-and-dance revue","excerpt":"three women in quasi-African clothes were a kind of chorus line, joining Mr. Kante in movements that distantly recalled African dances. Meanwhile the band pumped out two-chord and three-chord vamps that were exuberantly multinational, kin to reggae, soca, funk, Senegalese mbalax and Los Angeles folk-pop, but with African touches. Now and then, Mr. Kante played a tama talking drum or strapped on a kora, the griot's harp-guitar, but he was as likely to play Western-style chords or riffs as to pluck the trickling runs of Mandingo griot music.

Dear Diary:    The other day at lunchtime I popped over to the Jewish Room at the main library at 42d and Fifth where I was researching lists of Middle East peace organizations. I found the book I wanted, and as I sat down I noticed a man kneeling on a prayer mat, roughly facing east. Enveloped in both his midday devotion and his astrakhan-collared overcoat, he alternately salaamed and recited his supplications with outstretched hands.   What an omen, I thought.    I was not prepared, however, for his next activity.    Finishing his prayers, he started to do push-ups on the mat. He then returned to the table facing me.    Before commencing his chanting from the Koran he placed his prayer/ exercise mat in his attache case. I wanted to ask him if he was praying for strength, or peace in the Middle East.

Segue to Monday morning, when I took a call at the rotary phone on my kitchen wall.   \\"This is Nynex calling,\\" said a female voice quickly identifiable as robot voice mail. It was checking on my problem.   \\"If you are speaking from a touch-tone instrument and are no longer experiencing difficulty,\\" the robot instructed, \\"please press 1 now.\\"   I gazed at the rotary dial waiting for the rest of the menu.

Dear Diary:   During winter, for a more immediate reading than weather reports provide, I look out my second-floor window to see how people on the busy sidewalk are dressed.    The elderly are often over-layered, attired more heavily for the cold than I would be. Oddly, well-dressed businessmen are almost always without scarfs and/or hats. Carriage-pushing moms going in and out of grocery stores are, I have found, the most reliable indicators of how seriously one should layer up for the day.    If all else fails, I open the window to discover first hand just how cold it really is. LYNN McGEE                    . . .       Dear Diary:   A cold, dreary day (what else?) and with lowered head, gritted teeth and the need for a good laugh, I am headed for my local post office in Yorkville. Suddenly, from out of the gray mist, I pass a woman who is walking a small, dark something or other.   First I hear a loud uncouth grunt. This is followed by a silly-sounding squeal. Turning around, I run back to her and have my longed-for laugh. I say, \\"But isn't that a pig?\\"   Her eyes on the animal, she nods.   What I want to ask is, \\"So why are you walking a pig?\\" But I don't have the nerve. After a silence, she speaks.   \\"It's not mine.

(HarperPerennial, $13.95.) Erdrich's novel continues the Ojibwa tale she began in ''Tracks'' (1988). The narrative unfolds through parallel stories that are alternately comical and haunting. In one, Nanapush, an elderly Ojibwa, seethes over the man who married his sister and, he believes, killed and ate her. The other story follows Nanapush's adopted daughter, Fleur Pillager, as she plots revenge against the timber baron who bought what once was her land. The book ''finishes in gorgeous incantation and poetry,'' Karen Joy Fowler wrote in the Book Review.    THE RIGHT NATION: Conservative Power in America, by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge.

UNDER A WILD SKY: John James Audubon and the Making of ''The Birds of America,'' by William Souder. (North Point Press, $15.) John James Audubon (1785-1851), a native of St. Domingue (now Haiti), was a self-taught painter with a knack for reinventing himself.

SINCLAIR LEWIS: Rebel From Main Street, by Richard Lingeman. (Borealis Books, $24.95.) America's first Nobel laureate in Literature, Sinclair Lewis (1885-1951) wrote pointed satires of American mores, including ''Main Street'' and ''Elmer Gantry.'' His reputation has declined since his death from advanced alcoholism, but Lingeman's hefty biography captures the full sweep of Lewis's career. ''He was a literary sociologist,'' Lingeman writes, who ''knew his country better than most writers of his generation.''    DECEPTION, by Denise Mina. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.95.) Mina, whose previous novels have shown Glasgow's criminal underbelly, continues her recurring theme -- domestic dysfunction leading to criminal violence -- in this psychological thriller. When a psychiatrist is convicted of the murder of a serial killer, her husband embarks on a frantic search for proof of her innocence.    GREEK GODS, HUMAN LIVES: What We Can Learn from Myths, by Mary Lefkowitz. (Yale University, $19.) Through studies of the ''Iliad,'' the ''Odyssey'' and other classic texts, Lefkowitz reminds us that Greek myths are about religious experience. Modern accounts, she argues, have played down the divine in favor of explorations of human behavior.    ACQUAINTED WITH THE NIGHT: A Parent's Quest to Understand Depression and Bipolar Disorder in His Children, by Paul Raeburn. (Broadway, $14.95.) A decade ago, Raeburn's 11-year-old son was hospitalized for repeated outbreaks of rage","excerpt":"three years later, his 12-year-old daughter attempted suicide. In this harrowing memoir, Raeburn, a former editor at BusinessWeek, confronts his own parenting missteps and describes his family's encounters with a ''splintered, chaotic mental health care system'' that did more harm than good.

Furst's eighth spy novel is a compact World War II thriller about the journeys of a Dutch freighter pressed into service to do some of the work of the British merchant vessels being picked off by Nazi sea power.

It is no accident: Porcelain, that most fragile of artistic creations, is also the most enduring.  Canvases rot, stone crumbles, colors fade but the delicate sheen of a cup, plate or vase endures, unchanged, for millennia.   At first, in the 1730's, there was just a small establishment installed in the royal castle of Vincennes, but it soon became obvious that new, more spacious facilities were needed.

O. neighborhood screens yesterday under the title \\"Sea Wife\\" with rather bony fidelity, minus, it pains us to state, most of the meat. And for three curious reasons, one of them almost inexcusable. Still, what a book! And how the devil did Alfred Hitchcock bypass such a plot?Before considering this British-made adaptation, produced in color by Andre Hakim, and starring Joan Collins, Richard Burton and Basil Sydney, let's brush up a minute on that plot. A series of newspaper personal-column messages gradually links a quartet of peculiar characters. Three jittery correspondents—Sea Wife, Biscuit and Bulldog—obviously are at cross-purposes over a mutual black deed committed years ago against Number Four. Most of England starts wondering who they are and what they did. And, of course, why.The picture almost immediately goes to the heart of the matter, in flashback: one woman and three men are adrift on the Indian Ocean after a Japanese torpedoing. As somewhat casually played by the three stars, and Cy Grant, as their victimized Negro companion, the incidents thereafter shape a fairly familiar account of ocean survival. The color and some location sequences are pictorially sound. More vigorous performing and razor edged directing—Bob McNaught is much too genteel—would have done wonders.For villainy, we have Mr. Sydney's fatal trickery of the Negro he hates. Unfortunately Mr. Grant is relegated to a none too interesting role. (Who could ever forget the novel's majestic, dominating paranoiac, and his astounding revenge from the grave?)As for romance, there is Mr. Burton's gentlemanly pursuit of Miss Collins, who persistently spurns him. Sadly, too, we know why all along. With the cat out of the bag at the very outset, gone is one of the most spine-tingling dénouements in adventure fiction. And incidentally—perhaps for this very reason—the scenarist is uncredited.Nor are we divulging the lady's secret here, in spite of the picture's ads. Mr. Scott's secret still deserves keeping.

Mr. Ferris indicates his true sympathies by his statement that NASA had its \\"glory days, when men flew into orbit and on to the moon.\\" Such a statement suggests that even he can perceive the inspirational power of human space flight.

Throughout the picture suspense adds to the entertainment.Joe Rooker, a reporter, known as a dude, is married. Immediately after the ceremony a double murder is committed by Tony Garotta, a gangland leader. Rooker has evidence of Tony's guilt and writes the incriminating facts for his paper. Tony, sought by the police, takes Rooker and another reporter for an unwilling spin in a limousine and then in his motor launch, intending to kill them both and make his escape. He has also bombed Hooker's home, in which the reporter left his bride and mother-in-law.How Garotta is captured and how the welcome news of the safety of Rooker's relatives is flashed over the telephone is all to the credit of the director, John S. Robertson, and to Mr. Schildkraut. Joe's wedding is also well handled with a tinge of agreeable humor.While the series of events are faintly reminiscent of recent films depicting racketeers, they nevertheless are highly diverting. In Mr. Schildkraut's case less of the Ravenal and more of the Joe Rooker is desirable. Edward G. Robinson is excellent as Tony Garotta.

After a period of brilliant achievement in the late 1930's and early 40's, Ms. Levitt stopped making photographs for 15 years while she worked as a film editor and camera operator. Although she returned briefly to photography in 1959, virtually all the photographs she took in the following two years were stolen, and she did not begin photographing again until the early 1970's. Thus, there is a lacuna of more than 25 years in her photographic work. Moreover, the pictures she made after her return to photography are in general less interesting than her early work.   But those early photographs, made in the brief period between 1938 and roughly 1942, have long been recognized as a singular and wonderful achievement. Working with a 35-millimeter camera and a right-angle attachment that allowed her to photograph people without being noticed, Ms. Levitt produced an astonishing group of photographs of children at play in the streets of New York. Made with a perfectly limpid style, these pictures capture the anarchic energy and exuberant mix of fantasy and reality that the children bring to their enterprise.

Translated by Margaret Sayers Peden. 274 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $17.95.    FEW literary legends can compare to that surrounding ''The House of the Spirits,'' Isabel Allende's family-chronicle-cum-history of her native Chile. Her very first novel, published when she was in her early 40's, rose to best-sellerdom. Reviewers were indulgent. Here was a beautiful, humane, talented woman who happened to be the exiled niece of the martyred Chilean President Salvador Allende. The troublesome secret was that in prose and format the book was mostly imitation Garcia Marquez.   Happily, Ms. Allende is no longer the novice in ''Of Love and Shadows,'' a suspenseful thriller. Set in the terrorized Chile of Gen. Augusto Pinochet (himself an occasional character), it tells of the love that grows between Irene Beltran - feisty, innocent, marginally upper-class and a reporter for a women's magazine - and Francisco Leal, son of impoverished Spanish Republican exiles, an unemployed psychologist and sometime political activist who casually drifts into Irene's office as a freelance photographer. Together they cover a variety of beats, but something clicks when they start investigating Evangelina, a 15-year-old peasant girl and fabled miracle worker. During a brutal army search of her family's house, Evangelina, in a trance, singlehandedly lifts up a cruel lieutenant and hurls him out the door.   Soon thereafter Evangelina ''disappears''","excerpt":"through journalistic tips and footwork the hero and heroine locate the girl's corpse in an abandoned mine shaft, where bodies of dozens of the regime's opponents are also decaying. Francisco takes photos; word spreads; a scandal ensues. Then someone sprays Irene with bullets from a passing car. She survives in the hospital but is obviously marked for Government liquidation. With help from friends she and Francisco assume disguises, quietly flee Santiago and cross the Andes into Argentina, ready to fight the dictatorship from exile. ''We will return,'' they say. LOVE and struggle a la ''Casablanca'' - it's all there. Ms. Allende skillfully evokes both the terrors of daily life under military rule and the subtler forms of resistance in the hidden corners and ''shadows'' of her title, particularly in the churches or in simple unsung acts of solidarity. At the same time the author ably captures the voices of the regime's apologists - the complex lies and cliches of its proud male foot soldiers and the pat false phrases of its rich lady cheerleaders. A journalist herself, Ms. Allende renders with expert detail such offbeat worlds as the professional routines of a hairdresser, the range of types in a private nursing home or the operations of the Santiago city morgue. While her prose at times verges on soap opera, that is also one of its charms. She can just as deftly depict loving tenderness as convey the high fire of eroticism. And when you've successfully mingled sex and politics with a noble cause, how can you go wrong?   While the translation by Margaret Sayers Peden is at times awkward (for example, ''pythoness'' and ''chiromancy'' instead of ''fortune teller'' and ''palmistry'') and could use more colloqualisms and contractions, on the whole it's a supple piece of work."},{"year":"1986","title":"OLD HALL, NEW GALLERY - Despite its name, Temperance Hall, in its 138 years in Bellport, has been a tavern as well as a meeting place for the Sons of Temperance, a church and a sea captain's home.

This powerful exhibition of just five crusty, abstracted and oversize heads cast in bronze is his first in the United States, which comes as a surprise, considering what an impressive sculptor he is. Standing on white pedestals, the almost-five-foot-tall sculptures resemble massive log forms fashioned of mud by members of some prehistoric tribe. The aggressively gnarly and fecal-looking sculptures of William Tucker come immediately to mind. It may take a while to see that each of Mr. Josephsohn's works, made originally in plaster, is actually an enormous head on a thick neck. Relatively small features gather toward the middle of the big, flat faces, which have bulging, Jay Leno-like chins and stumpy ears that look as if they'd been partly bitten off. (Above, his ''Half-Figure'' sculptures, from 1995 to 2003.) In the gallery the sculptures exude a mysterious monumentality like the heads of Easter Island. Well-fed cousins of Giacometti's emaciated figures, Mr. Josephsohn's sculptures have a portentousness redolent of European existentialism in the 1950's. Yet they have a sweet, almost comical aspect, too, and their old-fashioned, determinedly earthbound humanism is reassuring. They look as if they will last a thousand years.

Judging by the full-disclosure press-release and the almost terminally hip catalog, this year's version may break the biennial mold. Self-aware, playful yet adversarial, it is a biennial-about-the-biennial -- an extension of art-about-art and more recently galleries-about-galleries. It teems with collectives -- the BERNADETTE CORPORATION, the CRITICAL ART ENSEMBLE, the CENTER FOR LAND USE INTERPRETATION -- and has a few fictive identities. CHRISSIE ISLES and PHILIPPE VERGNE, the show's organizers, even joined the fray by adding an invented curator named Toni Burlap to their team.    The catalog -- surprisingly user-friendly considering the plethora of fold-out pages -- includes excerpts from BERNARD-HENRI LÉVY's ''American Vertigo,'' a slyly pertinent multiple-choice quiz by the art critic BRUCE HAINLEY and an inspiring defense of art's destabilizing effect by JOHANNA BURTON. In addition to the usual rising stars, éminences grises, new discoveries and an unusually high number of artists who neither live nor work in this country, the show includes a painting that MILES DAVIS made in 1991, just before his death, and ''Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry,'' the documentary by GEORGE BUTLER.    This is the first biennial to be named after a movie by François Truffaut, or for that matter anything except the museum itself. The term is movie-speak for daytime filming with filters to simulate night. It sums up the currently fashionable, and possibly true, attitude that every effect is a form of artifice ready to be laid bare. In any event, expectation runs high. Will this year's biennial improve its art-world standing? Will it lay to rest that clichéd opposition between the political and the aesthetic? We'll have a better idea after Friday.

GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM's Frank Lloyd Wright rotunda is about to be the setting for another innovative architect's work, that of the Iraqi-born, London-based architect ZAHA HADID.    Ms. Hadid, whose buildings are often characterized by their floating lines and sharp angles, has designed the show herself, and it includes 30 years of projects.    The scope of Ms. Hadid's work is particularly large. On view starting Saturday will be some 140 of her Constructivist-inspired paintings, sketchbooks and drawings, which she calls her ''testing fields.'' The building's top three ramps will be lined with 95 architectural models from her projects.    The show will explore many of her recent buildings, including the Phaeno Science Center in Wolfsburg, Germany, and the BMW Central Building in Leipzig, Germany, along with her design for the Vitra Fire Station in Weil am Rhein, Germany, and the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati.    Also on view will be her prototype for the environmentally responsive, three-wheeled urban Z-Car, a commission for Kenny Schachter, a British collector and art dealer, as well as the Z-Kitchen, which was unveiled at the Milan Design Fair last month. The ''sensory responsive,'' science-fiction environment has two islands, one for fire, the other water, as well as a complete multimedia system.    Ms. Hadid, who was the first woman to be awarded the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2004, is well known to the Guggenheim. She has collaborated with the museum on other projects, including the exhibition ''The Great Utopia: The Russian and Soviet Avant-Garde, 1915-1932,'' in 1992.

You would not call Mr. Schoeller's pictures flattering, at least not conventionally so. He borrows from the photorealist painter Chuck Close the close-up, mug-shot-like approach, which drains faces of expressive animation and turns them into awesome landscapes of bulges, folds, cracks, pits, craters and stubble. Unlike Mr. Close, whose subjects are usually people he knows personally, Mr. Schoeller portrays famous people like Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Jack Nicholson. (His pictures frequently appear in The New Yorker.) There are some portraits of the nonfamous, including members of an African tribe and a United States soldier who sustained facial injuries in Iraq, but they are not irresistibly captivating the way the celebrity pictures are. There is something magically gripping about how these beings who exist in our collective imagination like pagan gods are so vividly, physically embodied, stripped of the protective veneer of publicity yet untainted by the salaciousness of the paparazzi shot. You can't help thinking, ''So that is what Mickey Rourke (or Donald H. Rumsfeld or Cindy Sherman) really looks like.'' Yet despite the remorselessly clinical scrutiny, they retain their superhuman auras, which may say as much about us as it does about them. If you have ever suspected the fabulous actor Christopher Walken (above) of being from another planet, Mr. Schoeller's eerie portrait clinches it.

(Jewish Publication Society, $18.95.) Hasidism appears profoundly conservative to modern eyes, but it was once a vibrant, radical, even revolutionary, movement. Breaking from the Judaism of the period, which they regarded as elitist, the Hasidic teachers of the 18th century sought to bring the gift of transcendence to the common man","excerpt":"through singing, dancing and fervent prayer, Hasidim aspired to mystical communion with God. Among the greatest of the Hasidic teachers was Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, famous for the wisdom of his storytelling. In his enchanting, magical third novel, Curt Leviant becomes a modern Nachman and summons up a world suffused with a tangible spirituality, a world where trees or dreams or numbers might speak prophecy, where God is ever immanent behind the thin veil of the printed word. Sensual and intriguing, \\"The Man Who Thought He Was Messiah\\" shows us Reb Nachman in 1800, his incredibly eventful final year. It begins with God's whisper, a hint of Messianic destiny: Nachman might bring salvation to the scattered nation of Israel. Despite the presumption of this notion, Nachman seeks to prove himself worthy, but fails: he falls in love with Lizabeta, a young peasant \\"more beautiful than the alphabet.\\" In fitting punishment, Nachman loses his ability to read; to atone for their liaison, he must leave Bratslav. Thus he travels to Vienna and studies composition with a proud but likable Beethoven; returning home with his new language of music, he finds his literacy partly restored. Setting out again, this time for the Holy Land, Nachman stops in Constantinople and, in a storybook scenario, cures the sultan's daughter of a storybook ailment. In Palestine divine tests await, and Nachman must probe his deepest values. Exquisitely written, Mr. Leviant's engaging exploration of the spirit will seduce and delight readers of any faith -- or lack thereof.

In a perfect world there would always be a play like ''Doubt'' running on Broadway, but after the initial rush of awards and reviews, maintaining a production without a single show tune can be a daunting task. If ''Doubt'' fell short of the blockbuster status of ''Proof,'' which ran for more than two years on Broadway, the reason has more to do with casting than with the play. While the producers of ''Proof'' renewed interest in the show by plugging in talented actresses like Anne Heche and Jennifer Jason Leigh into the role that Mary-Louise Parker originated, ''Doubt'' never recovered from the loss of its stars, Cherry Jones and Brian F. O'Byrne. Ticket sales plummeted almost immediately, and the mixed reviews for Eileen Atkins and Ron Eldard, above -- excellent performers who have had more success in other productions -- didn't help, either. In the end, no matter how acclaimed ''Doubt'' was, it still needed the right actors to make it go, which is just another illustration of how delicate a Broadway hit can be. Ms. Jones, incidentally, will reprise her role on a tour that begins this fall. As for Broadway, next week will be a little less interesting, there's no doubt about it.

I was in an American transit camp, in the midst of an enormous crowd of German prisoners who had all fled west from the collapsed Oder front to avoid falling into Soviet captivity. For five days we had been bivouacking under the open sky on a vast field surrounded by barbed wire. The military units had disintegrated in the chaos of the general flight, so there were hardly any familiar faces. We were hungry and covered with lice, and most of us were sick as a result of drinking undistilled water from the ditch that flowed through the camp, and because we had been lying on the bare ground day and night.\\n\\nI can think of no clearer sign of my own desolate state than the fact that May 8 never registered in my mind as the official end of the war.

The traditional durability of men's clothes, particularly those that are custom-made, supports this tendency.

Flowerhead, from Austin, Tex., wore the long hair and unpretentious clothes of the so-called grunge scene.
