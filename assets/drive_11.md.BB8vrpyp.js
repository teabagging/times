While you note this statistic in \\"Crime Bill Conferees Agree on Death Penalty\\" (news article, June 25), about the Biden-Thurmond compromise, you do not indicate why the public should be concerned about the impact of a Federal death penalty on Indian people.   Most murder cases in the United States are prosecuted in state courts, and the decision to impose the death penalty is left to the states. Fourteen states do not impose the death penalty. Many states that do, impose it only in very narrow circumstances, such as the murder of a police officer.   Although there are Federal laws against assassination and other forms of terrorism, there is no general Federal murder law, because murder is not a crime normally having national importance. Consequently, very few murder cases are prosecuted in Federal courts, and most of them involve murders committed by Indians against Indians on Indian reservations (the result of an 1885 Federal law that gave Federal courts jurisdiction over major crimes occurring on reservations).   For example, in 1988, 39 of 64 cases of first-degree murder prosecuted in Federal court involved Indians committing crime on Indian land. The other murders affected by the crime bill are those taking place on military reservations, Federal parks, and other Federal installations, such as Federal prisons.   If the members of Congress want to make a symbolic point about the death penalty, let them do it, but not by using Indians as their vehicle.   That Senators Daniel K. Inouye and Pete V. Domenici recognized the great need to ameliorate the effect of the Federal death penalty on Indian tribes is to be applauded, not labeled, as it is in your report, an attempt \\"to derail the death penalty compromise.\\"  NELL JESSUP NEWTON  ALEX TALLCHIEF SKIBINE  Washington, June 28, 1991   The writers are, respectively, professor of law at Catholic University and associate professor of law, University of Utah, Salt Lake City.

Bobbie inspired family and friends with her warmth, wit, charity and love. She was a vibrant and passionate woman who frequently devoted her efforts to political and educational campaigns. She loved sports and enjoyed competing and developing her skills. Bobbie was a student in Hanya Holm's first dance class in the United States, and was an early modern dance enthusiast thanks to her avant-garde mother. She danced and performed under the direction of Margaret Dobler at the University of Wisconsin. Bobbie was a fine student and graduated from UW in 1941. May 4th was her 61st wedding anniversary, an anniversary that marked so many years of a rare marriage. From that day in September 1938, when Bobbie and Bob met at the AEPhi Sorority tea, at the University of Wisconsin, it was a continuing love affair. They eloped to Dubuque, Iowa on May 4, 1940. As a new mother during World War II, Bobbie suffered the worry of separation from her husband. Shaped by her happy childhood in the Jewish community in Paterson, NJ, she maintained a lifelong bond to that place and those people. In Hillsdale, NJ, where Bobbie and her family resided for 45 years, she was active in many community activities including drama, fund-raising for many causes, and ardent support for the Bergen YJCC and Temple Emanuel. She regarded the growth and popularity of both these institutions as miraculous. Bobbie and Bob sponsored the immigration of the Raiskin family from Russia. She considered this to be a highlight of her life, & was immensely proud of this addition to her family. Bobbie leaves her husband, Bob, a daughter, Alison and a son, Roger, as well as a sister, Judith Weiner and her sister-in-law, Jane Kantor. She also leaves her three grandchildren, Kate, Daniel, and Sarah, and a host of loving nieces and nephews.

And it is he who gets mixed up with a bandit, whom Walter Brennan plays, and almost jumps out of his britches with fright at the subsequent escapades.But somehow his obvious conniptions are not particularly arch, nor are the travesties of ham acting that the others in the cast perform. The best to be said for this picture is that it has a few bright burlesque spots, is in color and comes to a finish in a reasonable length of time.On the vaudeville bill at the Palace are Billy Gilbert, Nils and Nadynne, Johnny D'Arco and Parker Gee and five other acts.
