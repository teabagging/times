The numbers are staggering. Over the past 20 years, membership in the auto workers' union has shrunk by half, to about 800,000. The steel workers' union has fallen by about 30 percent, the machinists by 40 percent. There are many reasons, mostly beyond the unions' control. Competition from abroad and a 20-year slowdown in productivity have stripped unions of their power to raise wages.
