But before this weekend, there hadn't been a show at the Beacon that this critic has seen, not even those of Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen, at which nearly every person stood through the entire concert, hanging on to the singer's every word and cheering loudly for almost every other lyric and line of dialogue. That was  the case, however, when Ani DiFranco performed on Friday night at the theater, demonstrating the power of music to bring a community together and mobilize it to thought and, perhaps in some cases, action.         Ms. DiFranco is a self-made star. At 18, after three years of performing, she began releasing her own albums (taking care of everything from producing to song publishing herself) and financing her own tours. Now 25, on the verge of releasing her eighth album, Ms. DiFranco has become one of the country's most successful completely independent musicians, strumming folk songs that mix experience and opinion with the energy and vehemence of punk-rock.

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media are hoping to kick off a ''Lord of the Rings''-like franchise with this first in a planned series of films based on the epic fantasy by C.S. Lewis. Andrew Adamson, who directed and wrote the screenplay with Ann Peacock, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, is best known for the computer animated ''Shrek.'' Tilda Swinton plays the White Witch; Liam Neeson lends his booming voice to the Christ-like lion, Aslan.    MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA The 1997 Arthur Golden novel has been in development for what seems like decades; it's now emerging under the direction of Rob Marshall, whose only theatrical film was the Oscar-winning ''Chicago.'' The story, of a poor girl from a fishing village who becomes the most celebrated geisha of the 20th century, may be Japanese in origin, but the cast is full of Chinese stars, including Ziyi Zhang as the central character and Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh as her rivals. Leading man Ken Watanabe, however, is indisputably Japanese. Related articles are on Pages 37 and 45.

According to the story, one day in 1977 when Mr. Bowie had begun the set of albums known as the Berlin trilogy, the producer Brian Eno rushed into the studio with a new record and said, \\"I have heard the sound of the future.\\" Surprisingly, it was not one of the punk-rock bombshells that disrupted pop that year, but a disco song: Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love.\\"\\n\\nSixteen years later, the booming, tightly controlled electronic pulse of \\"I Feel Love\\" resounds in a range of pop genres, from the housequake bass beats of Robin S.'s soulful \\"Show Me Love,\\" to the lustful electro-rap of Duice's \\"Dazzey Duks,\\" to the digital assaults of a dozen techno artists. Like a cannily adaptable virus, disco survived by evolving into stronger mutations. Ever since Mr. Bowie's Berlin trilogy, disco's influence has been pervasive, if subtle, in the electronic music favored by college students. Indeed, much of the music played on modern-rock radio stations is merely disco tormented by gloomy lyrics, pallid singing and inflexible drums.

It's as much of a tourist institution as the Louvre and the Seine. And that's what they tacitly tell you, to the point of becoming quite dull, in the French musical movie of the same title, which came to the Fine Arts yesterday.It goes on and on, this tedious picture, with one after another parade of garishly costumed show girls, carefully and conspicuously draped (as they usually are not in Paris) to suit the American Production Code","excerpt":"with one after another dull dance number, performed by the boyish Jeanmaire, and with a backstage romance running through it that is hackneyed enough to drive you mad.What happens? A. G. I. in Paris goes to the Folies Bergère and is dragged on the stage (by Jeanmaire) to take part in a race-track bit (you know, the girls are dressed as jockeys and the fellows ride hobby-horses across the stage). After a misunderstanding about his wallet, the G. I. goes nuts for Jeanmaire. Soon he is her ever-loving husband and is trying to become somebody on the musical stage.But while he is away on a road tour, Jeanmaire is beheld by a gent who also goes ga-ga about her and tries to win her by giving her lucrative work in advertising films. Unexpectedly (how else?), the touring husband comes home, misunderstands the situation and goes off in a towering rage. Through another doting actress, however, he lands a part in the Folies Bergère and—well, there is only one thing that can happen after this. It does. The husband and wife are brought together for a presumably endless run in the Folies Bergère.Given this dismal plot to play with, it is not much wonder Jeanmaire, who is usually a sparkling little creature, spends most of her time looking sad. Even her several toe-dance numbers lack ingenuity or verve. She does the whole thing as though she figures it's strictly for the tourist trade.In the role of the G. I. who marries her is Eddie Constantine, an American night-club actor who has become quite a star in French films. This is the first of his pictures to reach an American screen and—well, to judge by this one, 50,000,000 Frenchmen can be wrong. To the eyes of one candid beholder, he is a poor man's Dennis O'Keefe, a little shorter, a little stockier and considerably scarred about the face. The French are a funny people; maybe they like him because he can't sing.In the role of the \\"other woman\\" is handsome but sparkless Nadia Gray, and the snake-in-the-grass is performed by a pallid fellow named Jacques Castelot. Henri Decoin was the director, but that's nothing of which to be proud.The color is pretty good, however, particularly in one dance routine wherein Jeanmaire trips across some snowy roof-tops in a scanty costume. She represents, we gathered, the Spirit of Winter Sports.The English subtitles are no better than the witless French dialogue.

The first composer, Katrina Krimsky, presented standard post-hippie compositional ideas -- a little Indian music, a little jazz, a bit of violin -- and kept the normal concert etiquette, asking the audience to sit still and listen. The second, LaMonte Young, brought a minor sort of ideological framework to his piece. By situating his musicians around the hall, Mr. Young asked the audience to participate in a non-traditional way. In fact, everybody just sat there and listened. Given the general revolution in the relationship between audience and performer wrought by African-American and popular American music, the whole thing seemed more than a bit innocent.   Mr. Young's piece, \\"The Melodic Version of the Second Dream of the High-Tension Line Stepdown Transformer,\\" part of a longer composition called \\"The Four Dreams of China,\\" had more to do with the translation of technique into experience than with any sort of musical creativity.

Died of cardio-respiratory failure on July 2nd in Sleepy Hollow, New York, at the age of 84. He graduated magna cum laude from CCNY in 1941 with a degree in accounting. He was with Apfel & Englander from 1941-1969, becoming a senior partner","excerpt":"with Seidman & Seidman from 1970-1986, where he was national director of tax practice; and he served as a senior consultant with BDO Seidman from 1987 to his death. An expert in estate planning, he served as president of the New York State Society of CPAs from 1976-7 and chaired several AICPA task forces on estate taxation, was a frequent speaker and writer on tax law and estate planning, and was a champion of estate tax reforms. He was born October 14, 1920, in New York City, minutes ahead of his twin Stanley. As a youth he sold concessions at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds (on those days when a Mr. Goldstein chose the vendors; on other days the Irish kids got the nod); Bernard was sad to report that many of those Babe Ruth signatures from the Babe's 1938 return to the Polo Grounds as a Brooklyn Dodger coach were actually signed by fellow Dodger coaches Jesse Haines and Andy High. Among his early clients as a CPA were several artists and writers who worked at The New Yorker; without betraying confidences, we can report that A.J. Liebling's remuneration did not keep pace with his gustatory appetites. Bernard twice served in the armed forces. In his first stint, from 1942-1946, he served as a finance officer with the Army, stationed most memorably in England; he rose to the rank of Captain. He served from 1951-1952 as a Major in the Air Force, based in New York City, where he audited military contracts. He was a lifelong traveler; he and his wife visited every continent (including Antarctica); thanks to his accounting nature we know that they took thirty-five cruises on twenty-three different ships (including a dugout canoe) between 1963 and 2000. He beat polio as a teenager and was a three-time cancer survivor, a testament to his determination. He was predeceased by his son, Douglas, in 1960, and his twin, Stanley, in 2004. His survivors--his wife of 53 years, Helen, of Sleepy Hollow; his daughter, Susan, of Roscoe, New York; his brother, Joseph, of Culver City, California, and nieces and nephews all over--will miss his humor and elan.

Maria Excommunikata, a band with an international membership and a penchant for spooky melodrama, bore an uncanny resemblance to the outrageous glam groups that dash madly through Mr. Almodovar's movies. Arrayed in the black costumes of a thousand Halloweens, these women swooped through a repertory of original songs that mixed gothic imagery, hard-rock posturing and cabaret sentimentality into a brew that could have been deliciously clever had it been seasoned with a bit of irreverence.   But Maria Excommunikata's performance was unfortunately marked by more sincerity than wit. The group's musical abilities did not save it from its own pretensions. The operatic vocals of the Romanian-born Anca Marinescu intertwined with the atmospheric guitar work of Elizabeth Morgan and the snaky keyboards of Sina Hjort of Denmark to form intriguing sound patterns recalling early 80's gothic rock, but the songs' lyrics were stuck in typical boy-girl sentimentalism.

It went in silently, without the usual trumpets and banners","excerpt":"with such an unexpected quietude, indeed, as to cause a little wonder. An audience which more than well filled the theatre for the first showing ultimately went away in full possession of the reason. \\"Manslaughter,\\" in brief, appeared to be an excellent example of one of those things.Based on two doctrines—neither unknown to the several arts and sciences of Broadway—the picture gets itself tangled up in the various vicissitudes of life. One of its beliefs is that love is a great disrespecter of persons. This is conceded by all save Dr. Johnson. The other is that there are laws for the rich and laws for the poor. Never the twain shall meet, save under the auspices of a District Attorney who might bear watching by Representative Fish. That way lies communism.At all events, \\"Manslaughter\\" starts out with a rich, careless girl and a young, poor, honest District Attorney. Adopting his thesis that every one should be alike before the bar of justice, he eventually prosecutes his friend to the extent of about a dozen years in prison. Politics steps in, of course, and the woman shows a vindictive nature upon her release. But she comes around at the end, she runs down the street after her young man, and sobs on his tweed shoulder, \\"I love you.\\"So much for that. But there is more to \\"Manslaughter\\" than a prison sentence. There are, first of all, scenes on what is obviously some higher up's conception of a Long Island estate. There are a few moments of aquaplaning. This is presumably to show that Paramount has a neat taste in bathing suits, And then, when the girl arrives at prison, it is during a snowstorm—a dreary moment. And finally there is a spelling bee.This latter, perhaps, deserves a passing word. When Lydia Thorn arrived at the prison she was undoubtedly a bit stand-offish. Her hands, for example, hadn't been used to rough work. During the first day another prisoner shoved them into hot water and that started a riot. But in two years she had changed. The beginning was when she said to her former maid (now also in the jail), \\"Evans, what's your first name?\\" And the climax was when the girls were having a spelling bee in the prison school. Told to choose sides, both at once called \\"Lydia.\\"Of course, there is good in every dreary trial for manslaughter. The court room scenes of the picture are well done and so are some of the incidents scattered along the way. It cannot be denied that Claudette Colbert—given an even chance—is capable of excellent acting. She shows some of it in her part of Lydia, although the film is so busily going on its way that there isn't much time. Frederic March also is capable; he does not, however, need to turn so many curiously built corners.The picture is adapted from the story of the same name by Alice Duer Miller. George Abbott made the adaption and he also directed. THE SCREEN; Wealthy Girl Convicted."},{"year":"1992","title":"Old debts are paid in \\"The Price,\\" the Arthur Miller play given a scrupulous revival by John Tillinger at the Roundabout Theater Company. In this perceptive study of possessiveness and rivalry within family relationships, an estate is settled, legacies are established and antipathetic brothers try to find a common ground. But behind everything is an aura of disunion. \\"The Price\\" is a play of recognizable human dimensions and a definite change of pace for the playwright. It is also an irresolute work, despite the series of revelations that come just before the conclusion.   In the play, the author created one of his most colorful and comic characters, Gregory Solomon, the octogenarian furniture dealer who is as judicious as his biblical name suggests, yet is wily to the core. He has come to buy the Franz family inheritance. That estate is jointly held by two brothers, one a policeman (Hector Elizondo), the other a surgeon (Joe Spano). With his crackling humor, Solomon (Eli Wallach in a flamboyant mode) runs away with the first act, then all but disappears, to be replaced by a fraternal colloquy about success and failure and family loyalty.

While Mr. Priest made formulaic obeisances to Jah, the Rastafarians' version of Jehovah, during his set and sang an impassioned song dedicated to Marcus Garvey, most of his songs offered a crisp update of Jamaican lovers' rock, reggae's romantic branch. Mr. Priest croons come-ons like a British Lionel Richie, some of them barbed (as in \\"Close to You,\\" in which the verses denounce a woman's deviousness while the chorus woos her, and \\"Temptress,\\" with its threatening undertones) but most of them singlemindedly affectionate.    The music was neatly played pop, professionally knocking out its beat and keyboard hooks, and the tunes Mr. Priest chose were carefully restricted to the narrow vocal range where he sounds warmest. As the band chugged along, one mid-tempo song after another, Mr. Priest often sang languorously behind the beat, swinging his hips while women in the audience squealed.

It breaks its stride trying to go the full feature distance and its pedigree is open to suspicion. But the spectator who follows its course down the projection room is reasonably sure of enjoying a few good chuckles and finding himself watching the goat with interest most of the way.Damon Runyon wrote the story, and that should be an inviting beacon to those who saw his \\"Lady for a Day.\\" \\"Little Miss Marker\\" and \\"Million Dollar Ransom.\\" Further, Paramount has peopled it with the volatile and staccato Lee Tracy as the lemon-drop-eating \\"horse medium\\" (such being a man who knows what the horses are going to do before they do)","excerpt":"with William Frawley as The Professor, another horse specialist; with Helen Mack as the yokel girl who makes the Kid good; with Minna Gombell as The Professor's modest orchid, and with Baby LeRoy as the baby, the ever-present minor chord in a Runyon symphony.It is the slangily told tale of a young racing tipster who leaves the track at top speed, with the law at his heels, and loses his heart to the winsome small-town girl. A $15-a-week job in the general store does not provide for a specialist's care when his wife approaches motherhood, so the Lemon Drop Kid (he always carries a pocketful) tries his hand at robbery. The film slogs into heavy tragedy here, much to this corner's regret, because the comedy had been zipping along nicely, but it strives to regain its cheerfulness with a typically Runyonesque ending.As is true of all Runyon yarns, the plot is not as important as its characters and the picture adds a few new portraits to the Runyon film album. Mr. Tracy fits happily into the title rôle and the other players do as little, or as much, as can be expected of them. One of the most noteworthy contributions is Mr. Frawley's, with emphasis particularly upon the scene in which he croons a lullaby to Baby Leroy, and the infant—who is getting rangier every day—squalls back an accompaniment. Nor should one miss the moment when Maizie remarks that he talked her into marrying him.\\"You're right, my proud Caucasian beauty,\\" replies the Professor. \\"I remember saying 'Suppose we get married' and immediately everything went dark. When I woke up my ears were full of rice and I had a 2-year-old baby.\\"It was not the last line in the picture, but it might as well have been.

Mr. Sills is for the first time in many a moon quite restrained in his acting. He impersonates Nifty Miller, the silver-tongued, but occasionally hoarse-throated barker, who is supposed to be able to give his colleagues cards and spades in this line of endeavor. It is a rôle that one would imagine would be well suited to the audible stretches, but, through no fault of Mr. Sills, the sound device did not add one whit to the effect last evening. In fact it was a relief when the scenes were silent, accompanied by the now much despised subtitle.The utterances of the people in this case are muffled—so much so that while the words are distinct one wonders when the explosion is going to come. There was no loud outburst at this initial showing, but it is not a little strange to listen to Titan heads talking in a modulated fashion, in a tone that is about suited to a person some distance away.There is no consistency about the auxiliary sounds, for one moment there is a swish and swush of a steam engine and the next the wheels appear to be rolling along on the clouds. The sudden absence of the sound almost made one expect that the whole train would take off into the air. But what is most important is the picture, and that is there in a valiant and appealing form.It was conceded by the producers to be an unusually clever picture in silent form, but despite the compliments it received from all quarters in Hollywood the producers decided to punch sound holes in it, probably because they were enthusiastic about the Barker's glibness of speech. But while this Nifty is a shining light in his gift of gab, compared to his stuttering and stammering competitor, his flow of alliteratives and use of geography is not to be compared with some of his ilk that can be heard during the Summer months all over the country.Miss Mackaill figures as Lou, the girl who plots to captivate Nifty's son, Chris. Lou discovers after a while, to her amazement, that she has fallen in love with the boy, who is, incidentally, ably played by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Miss Mackaill is excellent in both her make-up and in expressing the words of the far-from-gentle Lou. She reveals a genuine ability as an actress, even in the audible stretches with Nifty. In fact, in justice to the players it should be said that with the exception of one minor performer they were not responsible for the talking weaknesses.Betty Compson, who plays Carrie, Nifty's girl and the Hawaiian dancer with the show, also gives a sterling performance.In an unobtrusive manner Mr. Fitzmaurice steadily depicts the workings of the tent show. The Barker and his dancer are first seen giving their ballyhoo and subsequently one perceives the interior of the show train, with its sleeping berths, its commissary car and the gambling section.The story, while nothing very disturbing in strength, holds the interest chiefly because it has been so well filmed. And Mr. Fitzmaurice does not overdo his ideas. You see the tent show people on the train and soon after an episode or so has been unfurled, Mr. Fitzmaurice, to remind you that these characters are still in transit, turns to the engine and the wheels of the car.The affection and hopes of Nifty for Chris are impressed upon one, but without the invariable hammer. The disappointment of Nifty when he hears that his son has married Lou results in a drinking bout, but even this is accomplished without a drink every second or fourteen bottles of whisky being shown on one table. And the end is quite satisfactory, but it would have been vastly more effective had it been possible to have a really admirable flow of the showman's lingo after Nifty shoes aside the stutterer and goes back to his old job.

The payment, mostly covered by insurance, is \\"an intelligent business decision,\\" said Jon C. Madonna, the firm's chief, and the deal did add up nicely when compared to some other Federal S.& L. settlements by the Big Six. But the Government's figures are pretty nice, too. Federal agencies have collected $2 billion from accountants, lawyers and other professionals from the S.& L. debacle -- half from four big accounting firms. \\"And the program is still young,\\" a Government spokesman said, with hope. The payments are funneled to institutions made insolvent by the S.& L. crisis. At P.& .G, Profit Follows Flub     The lesson may be to stick to soap. Tarnished by a $102 million loss in its third quarter from bad derivatives investments, Procter & Gamble regained some shine last week, announcing net earnings of $406 million in its fourth quarter. At 56 cents a share -- up 12 cents from the comparable quarter last year, excluding adjustments -- the results impressed analysts and spurred P.& G.'s chief, Edwin L. Artzt, to write the tale's epitome. \\"This was a good year,\\" he said, \\"and if not for the derivatives it would have been a great year.\\" Even more notable: P.& G. achieved its results despite sales not much higher than a year ago. Internet: New Way to Spend!      Credit card issuers rejoiced last week when some young, intrepid entrepreneurs successfully conducted the first secure retail transaction on the Internet, the global computer network. \\"Secure\\" is the key word","excerpt":"without a practical way to keep credit card numbers confidential, businesses will balk at turning the Internet into a major marketplace. Using a scrambling technique known as data encryption, though, tiny Net Market Company of Nashua, N.H., has solved the problem. And what was the pioneering purchase? A compact disk, \\"Ten Summoners' Tales,\\" by rock musician Sting. Price: $12.48 plus shipping. Disney Turns Interactive     Built on imagination, the Disney company had nonetheless envisioned little future for itself on the information superhighway. Until last week, that is, when the company announced a venture with three Baby Bells -- Ameritech, BellSouth and Southwestern Bell -- to offer video services to homes. The venture is still vague, with no word on how ownership or profits will be split, but the Bells' reach to 50 million customers in 19 states makes the deal's potential broad. That is, if Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, has really discarded his well-known disdain for the superhighway and believes, as Tinkerbell would surely hope. Valdez Catch: $287 Million     About 10,000 Alaskan fishermen reeled in nearly $287 million in damages from Exxon last week, courtesy of a Federal jury deliberating over the Valdez oil spill of 1989. But the compensatory award was much closer to Exxon's damage estimate of $113 million than to the fishermen's $895 million goal -- and that's how the paid parties saw it. \\"It's not what I wanted,\\" said the plaintiffs' lead lawyer. But it's not over till it's over, and the jury in Anchorage will next consider whether Exxon should pay punitive damages for the mishap. The plaintiffs are asking for a whopper: $15 billion. INTERNATIONAL Rockwell, Russia in Air Plan     Faster and safer are an odd mix in the world of transportation, but that's what Rockwell International and Russia's aviation-research agency expect from their plan to modernize the nation's air-traffic control system. Announced in Moscow last week, the project will eventually trim hours from flights between the United States and the Far East, and enhance safety by enabling planes near or over Russia to rely upon both Russian and American navigational satellites. True, it's yet one more story about the cold war's demise, but there's a kicker. Rockwell is getting $4.7 million in financing -- from the Defense Department. For Kenneth A. Medlin, a Rockwell executive vice president, the deal represents \\"defense conversion at its very best.\\" China Lands a Boeing Deal     When Boeing announced it would invest $100 million in a Chinese plant to make the tail sections of its most popular plane -- the 737 -- the reasons were several and self-evident. One, China is a big Boeing fan, with 52 of the nation's 79 plane purchases last year coming from the Seattle manufacturer. Two, China is looming ever larger on Boeing's ledgers, with 14 percent of the company's 1994 deliveries destined for that fast-emerging market. And three, Boeing competitors Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas are also energetically investing in China and chatting up the Chinese. Uncounted was Wichita, Kan., where the 737 tail sections are currently made. But to union complaints that last week's deal hurts American workers, Boeing just pointed to reasons 1, 2 and 3. THE ECONOMY Greenspan's Secret: Stories    How do Alan Greenspan and his Federal Reserve colleagues divine where inflation is headed? Complex computer models? Reams of statistics? Forecasting formulas? In part, yes, Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week, but there are also . . . stories. The Federal Reserve chairman used a dressed-up phrase, \\"detailed readings of firm behavior,\\" but he essentially meant stories -- stories from companies, trade groups and others about rising prices. Changes in the American economy and statistics' assumptions about economic relationships makes mere data insufficient for decision making, Mr. Greenspan said. Prices Up, Sales Down, Be Wary    Alan Greenspan's reliance on stories (see above) was vindicated last week, when the Government's July figures for producer prices and retail sales were released -- and at once were labeled misleading. Producer or \\"finished goods\\" prices rose half a percentage point, but the rise came mainly from coffee and gasoline prices, not from the prices that make the inflation-wary Federal Reserve snap to. And while retail sales fell one-tenth of a percentage point in July, the drop did not mean consumers wanted to buy less. It just mirrored auto makers' difficulty in restocking car lots that buyers had picked clean last spring. Fittingly, the deceptive data just \\"adds to the ambiguity\\" of whether the Fed will raise interest rates, said one economist. Companies Tapped for Wiretaps     The electronic frontier needs sheriffs like any other, and the F.B.I. says bills introduced in Congress last week will give it the technological draw on cyberspace bandits. Under the proposals, telephone and cable companies must alter their networks to make wiretapping easier, and they will get $500 million in Federal money to pay for the modifications. Company executives were reluctant to be deputies in the deal, however; one testified that $500 million is \\"severely underestimated.\\" The true costs are \\"very, very difficult\\" to come by, agreed the F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh. But, he warned, \\"I certainly know what the cost of not proceeding will be.\\" Info Highway: No Traffic Jam?      It all depends. That's the answer to the commercially pressing question of how many people ride the Internet, the global computer network. Cyberspace demographers often say 20 million to 30 million, but when Network Wizards, of Menlo Park, Calif., counted 3.2 million computers on the Internet in a survey last week, doubts arose. Not over the machines, but over how many people use each of them. About 10 people per machine is a common assumption; it underpins the 20 million to 30 million estimate. But some revisionists now say 3.5 people per machine, and some say 5 to 10. Riding on it all: how many potential buyers pass by the electronic storefronts that businesses are now scrambling to build.
