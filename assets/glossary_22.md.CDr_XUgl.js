A witness to the finished picture may readily figure why.\\"The Iron Petticoat,\\" which encloses Katharine Hepburn and Bob Hope, is about as inflexible and ponderous as the garment its title describes. And everybody connected with it might be forgiven for trying to claim an out.Through some not too subtle inspiration, it shamelessly has to do with a woman captain in the Soviet air force whose communistic enthusiasms collapse under the charm of an, American Air Force officer assigned to give her a whirl in London. In the course of proceedings naturally she abandons her uniform for frilly feminine things, drinks champagne laced with vodka, gets high and falls in love.\\"Ninotchka,\\" you say. It should be half as humorous as that old film! It should be even half as funny as the successive \\"Comrade X.\\" Three or four times around the circuit, even inside its own iron frame, and the jokes about the unfeminine Russian bursting out of her uniform become quite stale.Furthermore, the hopeful off-beat teaming of Miss Hepburn and Mr. Hope as the ideological opposites who get together has resulted in something grotesque. Miss Hepburn's Russian affectations and accent are simply horrible, and Mr. Hope's wistful efforts with feeble gags to hold his franchise as a funny man are downright sad. The notion of these two characters falling rapturously, romantically in love is virtually revolting. If this was meant to be a travesty, it is.Other grotesqueries that show up are James Robertson Justice, that giant Scot, in the role of a Russian espionage agent, Robert Helpmann as a pale Russian swain and Alexander Gauge, a British comedian, as an American Senator from the South.Ralph Thomas was the director. The producer was Betty E. Box. The film is in color and Vista-Vision and is distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. If any of them wish to file a disclaimer the line forms to the right, appropriately.
