They stand two blocks north of Marcus Garvey Park.    The results of the work are 16 large two and three-bedroom apartments for poor and moderate-income renters, a long common basement community center, a large, landscaped common yard in back, and some new offices for the social workers' group, the nonprofit sponsor of the housing project.   The development is called the Cenie J. Williams Jr. Houses after the founder of the Association of Black Social Workers, whose members will use the open basement for counseling their clients.  There are 13 two-bedroom apartments and three with three-bedrooms. Two of the smaller apartments will be reserved, under city law, for the homeless, which includes familes doubled up with others. Leases will be assigned by lottery over the next few months.   Rents for the two homeless-tenant apartments will be set at welfare levels, depending on the number of children in the tenant families. Maximum incomes for the remaining low-income units will be $22,140 for the two-bedroom units renting at no more than $518, and $25,680 for the three-bedrooms, which will have a top rent of $603, according to Mike Rodell, director of housing for the Harlem Urban Development Corporation.   \\"Brownstones are inherently nice places to live, and these have become some of the best ones we have seen,\\" said Mr. Rodell.

The ancient Veddah inhabitants of Sri Lanka were conquered by Sinhalese migrants from northern India in the sixth century B.C. The island's spices and precious stones and its position on the trans-Indian Ocean trade routes made it well known in ancient times. Sri Lanka was known to the Greeks as Tabrobane and to the Arabs as Serendip. From the third century A.D., Sri Lanka became a major center of Buddhist culture. Despite numerous invasions from India, the island was usually ruled by native kingdoms, but the invasions added a Tamil community to the premodern population. The Portuguese conquered the coastal areas after 1505 and also introduced Roman Catholicism. The Dutch displaced the Portugese in 1648; the British expelled the Dutch in 1795. Great Britain was the first foreign power to extend its rule over the entire island, with the defeat of the central kingdom of Kandy in 1833. In that year all of Sri Lanka was incorporated into the British Crown colony of Ceylon. Under British rule, tea and rubber plantations were established in the island's interior, and coconut plantations in coastal areas were consolidated under foreign control. Ceylon became an independent member of the British Commonwealth on Feb. 4, 1948; the Republic of Sri Lanka was proclaimed on May 22, 1972. Prime Minister W.R.D. Bandaranaike was assassinated on Sept. 25, 1959. His widow, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, leader of the Freedom party, was elected as his successor. In 1962 her government expropriated the property of foreign oil companies. The conservative United National party won a majority in Parliament in 1965 and agreed to pay compensation for the expropriated assets. In May 1970 Mrs. Bandaranaike was again elected prime minister. Leftists secured the nationalization of foreign plantations in the mid-1970's. Mrs. Bandaranaike's party was ousted by the United National party in 1977. Constitutional reform in 1978 aimed at increasing stability by establishing a presidential form of government. Pres. J.R. Jayawardene was elected on Feb. 4, 1978. But stability has eluded Sri Lanka because of the long struggle between Tamils and the Sinhalese. The political power acquired by the Tamil (mostly Hindu) middle class under the British was deeply resented by the Sinhalese (Buddhist) majority, which after independence slowly eroded Tamil rights. In 1957 the government proposed a Tamil state in a federal union and gave Tamil the status of a national (but not official) language. The pact was not fully implemented, and in the 1970's extremists began agitating for an independent Tamil state. The Tamils' minority status was reaffirmed in the constitution of 1972, the year the oldest insurgent group, the Liberation Tigers or Tamil Tigers, was founded. In July 1987 Pres. Jayawardene accepted an offer from India's Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to supervise a truce in the Jaffna region under which the government pledged to hold a referendum aimed at granting self-rule to Tamil majority areas in the north. The plan failed, however; Indian troops became bogged down in battling the rebels, while the planned referendum was disrupted by fighting between separatists who demanded total independence for Tamil areas. At the Sri Lankan government's request, India withdrew its forces in March 1989, and the Tamil Tigers agreed to a cease-fire as the government prepared its plan for Tamil-area autonomy. But this cease-fire soon broke down. The assassination of both the opposition political leader in April 1993 and Pres. Ranasinghe Pemadasa a month later left the nation in shock, although peaceful legislative elections were held later in May. In parliamentary elections held in 1994, the People's Alliance ended the United National party's 17-year rule. Prime Minister Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga won a landslide victory in presidential elections, and appointed her 78-year-old mother, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, as prime minister for a third time. Hours after the new president's inauguration, the Tamil Tigers announced a cease-fire. The truce was formalized in Jan. 1995, but when the government offered a peace plan to divide Sri Lanka into autonomous regions, the Tamil rebels renewed the civil war which by 2000 had cost at least 60,000 lives and displaced at least a million people. Pres. Kumaratunga handily won re-election in Dec. 1999 but on the battlefield the Tamils grew more successful in 2000. A series of failed offensives against the Tigers in 2001 brought government to a halt and the loss of its majority. In Oct. 2001, Pres. Kumaratunga dissolved Parliament; resulting elections brought a three-party United Front to power. A Norway-negotiated truce in Feb. 2002 led to renewed peace talks in Thailand between the new government and the Tigers.

Dominica was visited by Columbus on his second American voyage; but though frequented by Spanish ships, it was not settled until French missionaries arrived in the 1630's. Carib resistance was so strong that the French and British agreed to consider the island neutral territory, until it passed under British control in 1763. Later it was administratively joined to the Leeward and then the Windward Islands, and then became part of the West Indies Federation. It entered into political association with the United Kingdom in 1967. In 1978 Dominica gained independence from Britain. Prime Minister Mary Eugenia Charles's Freedom party has held power since 1980 on a program of economic reconstruction. Hurricanes in 1979–80 largely destroyed the island's agriculture. The government of Prime Minister Mary Eugenia Charles's Freedom party implemented a program of economic reconstruction and diversification after the disaster. In 1992 it began a controversial policy of granting citizenship to businessmen, Asians in particular, in exchange for investment in Dominica's economy. In 1995, Charles resigned after 15 years in office. The United Workers party took 11 of 21 seats in parliamentary elections and named its leader, Edison James, the new prime minister. But Jan. 2000 Assembly elections produced a coalition of the Labor and Freedom Parties, as the United Workers went again into opposition. Labor Party leader Roosevelt “Rosie” Douglas was named prime minister, but he died unexpectedly on Oct. 2, leaving former Communications and Works minister Pierre Charles to serve as acting prime minister.

No flavored coffees are served, but beer and wine are available, as are sandwiches, pastries and ice cream. Italian is heard spoken because the consulate is around the corner. The only concession to American taste is the tunafish sandwich. Thick and Tart     Passion fruit is the latest flavor in the line of mellow vinegar-based sauces called Vignettes. It was created by Michael Chiarello of Tra Vigna restaurant in St. Helena, Calif., for his Consorzio line of condiments. Though suitably tart, the thick, pink-gold passion fruit sauce is still sweet enough to splash on a fruit salad. It is excellent as a fat-free sauce for grilled fish or for marinating pork or chicken. The sauce, $8 for 12.5 ounces, is available at Williams-Sonoma stores. Go Fish    Linda Blankenhorn, an owner of La Boulangere, 49 East 21st Street, has started working on Catch 21, a fish and produce market a few doors away at 31 East 21st Street. She is scheduled to open it by the end of March. Tony Castenazzi, a former manager of the fish department at Balducci's, will run the fish counter. \\"Half the store will be a big crisper room where people can select organic and specialty produce,\\" Ms. Blankenhorn said. Food Translation    The first American edition of Gambero Rosso, a popular Italian food magazine, has just been published. The name, which means \\"red shrimp,\\" is a common term for restaurants and pizzerias in Italy.   The first issue, 99 pages, provides information about buying and preparing cabbage in a variety of dishes, instructions for cooking pasta, profiles of restaurateurs and chefs in Italy and the United States, and wine ratings. The magazine, $4.95 a copy, will be published quarterly. Subscriptions, $15.85 for one year, can be ordered by calling (800) 969-1258. Off the Menu Moving an Elephant    An Elephant and Castle has gone from SoHo to NoHo. The original Elephant and Castle on Greenwich Avenue is still going strong after 20 years, but a downtown version, which opened on Prince Street in 1979, closed last summer.    The sibling is expected to reopen this week at 6 Bond Street, near Broadway. It occupies the main floor of a town house. It has an informal elegance, with polished woods, muted tones and a whimsical mural of elephants wandering in a neighborhood cityscape. In the rear is a bar.   The menu includes the restaurant's popular burgers, omelets and sandwiches but also offers a list of substantial main courses, mostly at $11 to $15. The owner, George Schwarz, says he plans to turn the garden-level floor into a takeout shop and cafe. New French Bistros    In a manner of speaking, it's like keeping it in the family. A couple of established French bistros have closed and given way to two new French bistros. Ricochet, which opened at the end of January at 43 East 20th Street, replaced L'Escale, with a French-Mediterranean menu devised by the chef-owner, Bruno Hamon.   Further downtown, Zut! opened earlier this month at 139 Duane Street (near Church Street), with whimsical decor -- including straw-hatted chandeliers, a round bar and wallpaper with prancing animals -- and French cooking by Herb Wilson. Zut! replaced Zinc. Retro Servings     Henry Lambert, who started the Pasta and Cheese chain, has opened Lex, at 133 East 65th Street, once occupied by Old Denmark.    Lex is serving what Mr. Lambert calls American comfort food. Expect no blueberry sauce on the fish or black pepper in the ice cream. Instead, classics like sole meuniere, chicken pot pie and that dinner-party staple of the 1960's, cold lemon souffle, dominate the menu. Main dishes are $17.50 to $24.   Lunch features the kinds of salads and sandwiches, $9.50 to $13, that were served at the Cafe on Five that Mr. Lambert used to run at Bergdorf Goodman. The chef is Jeanne Ramos, who worked in the cafe. Circa Second Avenue    Circa, 103 Second Avenue (at Sixth Street), is due to open next month in the space once occupied by Jerry's 103. The designers, Peter Sibilia and Damien Vizuete, say the space will be \\"retro postmodern.\\" The food, however, will be new American, not retro anything, with brick-oven pizza and low-fat dishes. The chef, Bruce Barnes, was previously at the Harvest, a former Greenwich Village restaurant. B.Y.O.

In 1964, the film blazed a trail for rock video (the film critic Andrew Sarris has called it \\"the 'Citizen Kane' of jukebox movies\\"). The CD-ROM version, released last year, was the first feature film to be squeezed in its entirety onto a compact disk.\\nA MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR The disk, available for Macintosh and for Windows, contains more than just the complete 90-minute film. It also has the full script","excerpt":"166 screens of trivia-filled written commentary about the making of the film and about its principals; the movie's trailer; two shorter, earlier films made by its director, Richard Lester, and a videotaped interview with Mr. Lester. The software on the disk also allows the viewer to search for any word in the film or commentary (\\"lad,\\" for example, appears in the script three times).\\nTELL ME WHY Of all the movies available for conversion to CD-ROM, this one was chosen because it's a musical (people with multimedia computers want multiple media, including music, in their software), because it's the Fab Four (who are still a favorite of collectors, the trivia-obsessed and scholars) and because of the black-and-whiteness. Mr. Lester chose black and white film to lend a documentary quality to the movie's scripted version of two days in the lives of the Beatles. Color video, when digitized, requires at least twice as much computer power and disk storage as black and white. The movie, stored digitally in a computer-video format called Quicktime, plays back on a typical computer screen at 2 by 2.75 inches. The disk's publisher, the Voyager Company in New York, turned this limitation into an advantage, filling the rest of the screen with other elements, like the commentary. The CD sells for $39.95 at computer software stores.\\nBWOOONNNNNNNGGGG! Voyager also exploits what may be the most famous chord in rock history, which opens the title tune: a G major chord over D with a suspended 4th, according to \\"The Beatles Complete Scores\\" (Hal Leonard, 1993; $59.95). George Harrison strummed it on a prototype of the Rickenbacker 360, a 12-string electric guitar. Bruce Eder, a film and rock critic who prepared the commentary that scrolls alongside the video, writes that the slightly dissonant chord \\"sets up the entire movie -- the conflict between old and new, the expectations of the old versus the young, and the sense of a new culture, rock-and-roll culture, defining itself against the grain of post-war society.\\" On disk, the chord chimes every time a user adjusts the volume level.\\nWHEN I'M HOME . . . Can you watch a 90-minute movie on a computer? Not really; the chair isn't comfortable enough. (There is technology that enables a movie recorded on a CD-ROM to fill an entire television screen, letting a viewer sit passively on the couch.) Still, megabytes aside, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is an active reminder that the Beatles were talented comic actors, four cultural superheroes revealed as charming youths. Bosley Crowther, reviewing the film in The New York Times, called it \\"a whale of a comedy.\\" But it helps if one digs mid-60's British humor. (Interviewer: \\"What would you call that hairstyle?\\" George: \\"Arthur.\\")\\nYOU CAN'T DO THAT A marketing opportunity may have been missed.

Although this is its first presentation in a commercial theatre hereabouts, it has been shown non-theatrically for some time and, in that area, has been warmly admired.Cause for admiration is apparent. That such an ambitious screen enterprise as Shakespeare's classic tragedy should have been attempted at all by a group of amateur film-makers is reason for surprise. That it should have been done as smoothly, ingeniously and tastefully as is betokened in this film is a clear demonstration of the intelligence and sincerity of Mr. Bradley and his group.Improvising their Roman settings out of classical architecture to be found in the area of Chicago and using the simplest of Roman costumes, this company of earnest collegians has given a firm pictorial character to the sombre and severe old drama of political intrigue and violence. Settings of marble halls, rotundas and sweeping colonnades have been sparingly used to establish an imperious atmosphere, and clever camera angles on floors and furniture have been devised to suggest oblique moods.Most ingenious in Mr. Bradley's direction, however—and most indicative of his smart economy—is his use of close-ups against dark backgrounds for establishing and studying personalities. His images of action are also vivid—such as blood flowing over cobblestones. And he has got a good sense of bleakness in the Battle of Philippi by staging it amid some gnarled sand dunes.With all due respect, however, it must be said that the performance of the film betrays its amateur origins and its \\"little theatre\\" bounds. The actors, while obviously determined, invariably have a stiff, self-conscious air, and their solemn delivery of the speeches is generally in declamatory style. This includes Mr. Bradley as Brutus, Harold Tasker in the title role and a youthful Charlton Heston as Marc Anthony. (Mr. Heston has since become a Hollywood star.) The consequence is a conventional and unenlightening reading of the play. The one claim of the film to theatrical attention is as a resourceful pictorial exercise.
