The genesis of this special treatment was the 1981 tax law, which authorized most persons receiving new-issue shares from certain electric, gas and water utilities to exclude from gross income as much as $750, or $1,500 on joint returns, when received in lieu of cash through a dividend reinvestment plan.

Until the report appeared in June, Congress had been proceeding with a rather standard strategy: It would advance $70 billion to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to get the nearly broke agency through the current wave of bank failures. The banks, however, would continue their decades-old practice of covering the cost of deposit insurance by paying annual premiums to the F.D.I.C.

Mr. Garnett went abroad a few seasons ago and, having a rough outline of a script, he shot doorways in Japan, barrooms in Indo-China, the race track at Singapore, a pier in Bombay, a fishing village in the Laccadives, a twisting street in pre-war Shanghai. Hollywood bridged the gaps, set up the process screen, placed Fredric March and Joan Bennett before it and tuned the sound-recording apparatus to the frequently humorous frequency of Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell, who ride the kilocycles in tandem.The result of it all is \\"Trade Winds,\\" which blew gently into the Music Hall yesterday and may be remembered by posterity as the process shot that went 'round the world. It is not exactly a travelogue. As a mystery film it's a bit on the porous side. We hesitate to call it a romantic comedy, beginning as it does with a suicide, adding a murder and ending with a third body on the floor. And certainly it's not a straight drama. Maybe a new word is in order—a travestery comiromance, or a dramalogue of travesty. Lewis Carroll could get away with it. Who are we to whiffle an opportunity?The point about it is that it is light, agreeable and extremely interesting technically, including the technical switch from blond to brunette of Miss Bennett. But it doesn't add appreciably to the stature of the San Francisco police department or of its chief investigator, Sam Wye (Mr. March). They chase their suspect most of the way around the globe to accuse her of murdering a bounder by pointing a pistol at his chest, pulling the trigger and killing him with a bullet through the base of the skull. Of course, Mr. Wye eventually gets her off, but his methods are not particularly brilliant. Charlie Chan could have turned out a better denouement without even quoting Confucius.At least, it has been glibly written and has the services of a well-mannered cast. Mr. March has a good line to toss for every toss of the Bennett shoulder. Ann Sothern is surprisingly successful as the leech on the bloodhound. Ralph Bellamy plays Detective Blodgett as you would expect Detective Blodgett to be played, and there is a genial company in the background. Besides, whenever the plot becomes too thick there is always the chance to peer over the players' shoulders and see what is happening on the process screen. Mr. Garnett must have had a grand trip.

Tennessee Williams compared her radiance in the role (which he had based on his mother) to the ''greatest lines of poetry'' and mourned that her reputation would be limited to the ''testimony and inspiration'' of those who saw her. That's mostly true","excerpt":"Taylor appeared in only three films, all silent, and died shortly after leaving the road company of ''Menagerie'' in 1946. But something of what made her Amanda so memorable was captured by Eileen Darby (1916-2004), a photographer who worked Broadway from 1940 to 1964, producing some of the signal theatrical images of the period: Marlon Brando menacing a thrilled but terrified Jessica Tandy in ''A Streetcar Named Desire''; Carol Channing, framed by a halo of hair and feathers, at the top of the Harmonia Gardens stairs in ''Hello, Dolly!''    Some 250 of these images are featured in ''Stars on Stage: Eileen Darby and Broadway's Golden Age,'' to be published by Bulfinch Press this month; many are included in an exhibition of Darby's work that opened Tuesday at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. None is more valuable and unexpected than this series of 12 frames of Taylor in ''Menagerie'' -- a ''key sheet'' from which the show's press agent might choose a publicity shot. It records one of Amanda's efforts to earn extra money by selling renewal subscriptions to a ''magazine for matrons'' called The Home-maker's Companion. The action, caught at about one shot every five seconds, is so legibly written on Taylor's face that it can be matched nearly frame by frame to the Scene 3 monologue. Frame 2: ''Ida Scott? We missed you at the D.A.R. last Monday!'' Frame 4: ''You're a Christian martyr, yes, that's what you are.'' Frame 7: ''That wonderful new serial by Bessie Mae Hopper is getting off to such an exciting start.'' Frame 9: ''Go take a look in the oven and I'll hold the wire!'' Frame 11: ''I think she's hung up!'' And then, in Frame 12, a fleeting look of betrayal and confusion aimed at the telephone itself: a reminder that Amanda's runaway husband was a telephone man who ''fell in love with long-distance.''    After Taylor's own husband (her second) died in 1928, she went on a 10-year bender she later called ''the longest wake in history.'' That's on her face, too, and one of the things Darby's photographs so memorably record is a time when Amanda could be played (indeed, could only be played) by a plain, 61-year-old warhorse whose suffering, far from being a disfigurement requiring erasure, was the essence of the gift she brought to the stage.

Yet when the Philharmonic did get a crack at Carnegie under festival conditions, for the reopening of the hall after renovation in 1986 or the centennial celebration in 1991, the result was Philharmonic business as usual.   Philharmonic business has changed drastically over the last year under Kurt Masur.

WILSON Jazz Generations    John Pizzarelli Trio, Down Beat, 70 Grove Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, (212) 620-4000. The newest jazz club in Greenwich Village opened this week with a group featuring the second generation of Pizzarellis, one of the best known names in jazz of the last 40 years. The guitarist John Pizzarelli follows in the footsteps of his father, Bucky Pizzarelli, who was a big-band guitarist in the 1940's and leader of notable duos and trios since then. John, who plays a custom-made seven-string guitar and also sings, is joined by his brother Martin, who plays bass, and Ray Kennedy on piano. John actually represents the third musical generation in the family -- he was taught by his banjo-playing great-uncles, Peter and Bobby Dominick, who also taught Bucky Pizzarelli. The trio plays tonight through Sunday at 9 and 11 P.M.  There is a music charge of $12 and a one-drink minimum at the tables, or a $7 music charge at the bar. J. S. W. By Request, Scott Hamilton    Scott Hamilton Quintet, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, (212) 533-7900. The tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton has hit on an unusual way to emphasize his international appeal. Although he is usually thought of as a specialist in Swing Era jazz styles, his latest album, \\"East of the Sun,\\" reaches out in two world-splitting directions. It is based on requests by Japanese fans in a poll conducted by the Japanese jazz magazine \\"Swing Journale\\" and it was recorded in England with a group of British musicians. But this weekend he is back with his regular American quintet at Fat Tuesday's: John Bunch, piano; Chris Flory, guitar; John Weber, bass, and Chuck Riggs, drums. Shows tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10 and midnight, and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a $20 music charge and a $10 minimum each night. J. S. W.

In New Hampshire Mr. Rove provided an early peek at a political argument in formation.    Mr. Rove does not deny that the economy is in trouble.

So it was last week when gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia produced a surprisingly large Democratic victory in a Republican state and a razor-thin Republican victory in a Democratic one.   If the race in New Jersey, between Republican Thomas H. Kean and his Democratic opponent, Representative James J. Florio, was too close to call before the voting, it remained officially so after it.  Mr. Kean, who advocated a Reagan-style package of state tax and spending cuts, led by just 1,726 votes over Mr. Florio, who had opposed the reductions. But with 2.28 million ballots, it was hardly the kind of margin out of which victory speeches are fashioned.

As pessimistic as this may sound, I feel that teaching young people moral values is a waste of the school system's time unless this education begins once a child enters kindergarten, or even earlier. By the time a child reaches middle school, any value, if any, that he or she has learned, is already embedded in his or her mind and seldom can moral values in these youths be changed.

Disasters, natural and otherwise, have been hammering the city ever since. The other day a man in a midtown delicatessen complained about being charged $7.50 for a plate of bacon and eggs. He was reminded that this was New York.   \\"It's a tough town and it's gettin' tougher,\\" he was told. \\"Pay the cashier.\\"   In February the World Trade Center was bombed. The idea was to terrorize New Yorkers and it sure did. Six people were killed, other plots were uncovered and local television producers were struck by an uncontrollable and apparently permanent urge to run clips of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman on virtually every newscast.   In the haphazard and radically democratic world of local TV news, the sheik became as familiar a figure as Joey Buttafuoco.   In March came the Blizzard of '93. Winds at La Guardia Airport reached 71 miles per hour. Nearly a foot of snow fell. Once again garbage cans and umbrellas were blown about indiscriminately. The National Weather Service warned, \\"This could be the worst storm of the century.\\"   When it was over, New Yorkers looked up, shook it off and moved on to other terrible occurrences. That is what it's like here. Life in New York is all about combat readiness, the joy of survival. Ordinary storms aren't even noticed. Only storms of the century get our attention.   This is a point of great pride. It sustains us. New Yorkers are the elite corps of urban dwellers. We are masterful at handling crises for that is our normal state of affairs. What's a blizzard to someone faced with a lifetime of alternate side of the street parking?   There was a lull in the spring. The weather was gorgeous. It was a time to relax, recuperate and prepare for the onslaught of July. We weren't disappointed. Temperatures rose into the hundreds and then we were given a state report on Crown Heights that returned us to the familiar terrain of racial strife.   \\"Sometimes,\\" said a video store clerk in Greenwich village, \\"I feel like we're living in an insane asylum.\\"   A customer looked up and said, \\"Most of the time.\\"   Even sports fans have suffered. The city has the worst team in baseball, a team distinguished by a leadoff hitter (soon to be fired) who amused himself by tossing an explosive device at a group of fans, and a pitcher who got his kicks by spraying bleach on a group of reporters.   The other baseball team is threatening to leave town altogether.   There's more. Police corruption hearings have been scheduled, incredibly, for the month before the mayoral election","excerpt":"teachers are threatening to strike; the Board of Education has problems convincing anyone to come run the school system, and we've been told that tests to determine if the schools are safe from asbestos were so unreliable that they are worthless.   This is madness, right?   No doubt. Nevertheless, the madness called New York has its own strange allure. It's a madness millions of us are unwilling to relinquish. Dealing with the problems of New York -- some of them so crazy they can leave you breathless -- is what defines New Yorkers. This is not a town for the faint of heart.   And the compensations -- the night out, the discovery of a good, cheap restaurant, the concert in Central Park, the Knicks game -- are savored all the more because this is a place where nothing comes easy.   True New Yorkers, when out of town, are like warriors on leave. You've got a thousand stories that will amaze your listeners. You assure them that they're all true. They really are. Then it's time to return. And no matter how cynical you may be it's hard not to get a thrill when, flying home after a breather, that skyline rises up again to greet you.
