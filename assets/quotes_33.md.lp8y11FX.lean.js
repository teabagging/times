New Yorkers today know it only by its famous nickname, but when the Fuller Building -- as it was called originally -- was erected in 1903, it was one of the new century's wonders. Many ridiculed the architect Daniel Burnham when its triangular shape began to rise out of the construction site on East 23d Street, but the building quickly began to attract photographers. In FLATIRON: A Photographic History of the World's First Steel Frame Skyscraper, 1901-1990 (American Institute of Architects, $29.95), Peter Gwillim Kreitler, a photographer and collector, has assembled a superb collection of their images. Edward Steichen's moody, rain-soaked portrait is beautifully reproduced, as is Alfred Steiglitz' delicate snowscape. The Photo Secessionists presented the building as a natural phenomenon looming out of the bustle of the city. Later photographers saw it as a triumph of modernism. By shooting it from an oblique angle, the Bauhaus architect Walter Gropius made the building appear to tilt, revealing the avant-garde character lurking beneath its neo-Renaissance friezes. Alongside the familiar images in Mr. Kreitler's collection are little-known finds, like the haunting night view of the Flatiron lit up like a luxury liner, a host of lesser buildings trailing in its wake.

A feline temptress whose trophies of romantic conquest were furs, jewels and Champagne, she was less of a saucy free spirit. Underneath her caricature, one sensed real rage boiling.    At the age of 62, Miss Kitt, who opened a two-week engagement at the Ballroom (253 West 28th Street) on Tuesday evening, is still playing the same role, though the sense of irony in her performance has broadened considerably.

Among these are weak foreign trade","excerpt":"still high interest rates; trouble in the equity markets; growing imbalances between ''goods-producing'' and ''services'' sectors; industries under siege from the strong dollar and intense foreign competition; high unemployment and sluggish expansion abroad; and evolution of the United States into a marketing, service and distribution arm for other countries' products.   Given the Federal Reserve's policy of reducing monetary growth over time, the demand for funds that is created by excessive deficits promotes high interest rates and props up the dollar. The high interest rates dampen domestic spending, and a strong dollar causes bigger trade deficits. Ultimately, the trade deficits offset the stimulus of domestic spending. Once that happens, short-term interest rates fall and the dollar weakens - the latter a potential source of re-inflation. Slower growth, rising inflation, shrinking profits, higher unemployment and even worse budget deficits are a possible consequence.

The amber tonic is innocently in evidence, however, as a comedy prop, for the hero is allergic to brandy. Seems he was in a wine cellar in France when a bomb struck and he was almost drowned in the stuff. Now everytime he gets a whiff of the nectar he has hallucinations and imagines that he hears his dog talking.The gag is good for some laughs the first time around, but Norman Krasna (author-director-producer of this M-G-M picture) overworks it to a point of conscious cuteness. However, \\"The Big Hangover\\" is not all fluff, for Mr. Krasna has developed a leading man with a purposeful slant on life. Van Johnson gives a rather agreeable, if at times somewhat forced, performance as a veteran of moderate means who is an honor law school graduate and has a bright future in a plushy law firm.The boss's lovely daughter, most engagingly represented by Elizabeth Taylor, marks him as her man, thereby assuring his success. But he pushes aside easy progress when he discovers that the firm is party to a discriminatory scheme to oust a Chinese doctor from an apartment house. Mr. Krasna, as you can readily see, has a sharp point on the end of the funny stick and he employs it most of the time through dialogue that is crisp and meaningful.Generally speaking the performances are nicely keyed. Mr. Krasna has done all right as a director, so it is unfortunate that as a writer he just labored the brandy psychosis gag. In addition to the competent work of Van Johnson and Miss Taylor, there are amusing characterizations by Percy Waram, Gene Lockhart and Edgar Buchanan. And, Leon Ames is full of conviction as a city attorney who, in a moment of weakness, toadies to the wealthy lawyers and is pointedly reminded of his responsibility as a public servant by the indignant veteran.\\"The Big Hangover,\\" although it runs an uneven course","excerpt":"still is good for some laughs and is deserving of attention.Woody Herman and his orchestra head the Capitol's stage show with Gene Baylos and Bill Farrell.

It occurs in at least three recent French productions: \\"Bof,\\" \\"Les Mariés de l'An Deux\\" and \\"Le Souffle au Coeur.\\" The last two have been leaders at the box office for weeks, while the first was rewarded with a \\"Succès D'Estime,\\" a phrase that might be freely translated as: financial failure.Arts AbroadLouis Mailé's \\"Le Souffle au Coeur\\"—a French expression designating a slight heart condition that adolescents sometimes experience passingly—describes the sentimental education of a teenager in a middle-class provincial milieu in the fifties, when France was still embroiled in her Indochina war. Adults whom only the magic word \\"career\\" can extract from their apathy, homosexual Jesuit educators, equivocal boy-scout friendships, youngsters playing practical jokes or losing their virginity in brothels—in short Mr. Mallé has conjured up a dinosaur one had thought long since extinct: The Grande Bourgeoisie.The result is that the nature of the subject has contaminated the work: the film is well made, polite, unimaginative, studded with society jokes, dry as an insect and quite boring. Perhaps, it was to jolt the spectator out of his tedium that Mr. Mallé introduced incest. It is committed by the mother, a \\"foreigner\\" with Bohemian inclinations, and her yet unspoiled son. The scene is brief, and it is immediately erased—from incest to palimpsest—by a scene of \\"normal\\" love-making and a hearty family laugh","excerpt":"still, it ought to have alarmed the French censors, and their intervention ought to have made the movie into a scandal, that is, into a success.Unfortunately, they saw nothing wrong. Indeed, \\"Le Souffle au Coeur\\" was selected to represent France at the Cannes Festival. And so the indispensable uproar would never have occurred, had it not been for the help of that dowdiest of institutions, French television.Michel Pollac invited Mr. Mallé, Alberto Moravia and Professor Grassé to discuss incest on his weekly literary television program, \\"Post-Scriptum,\\" one of the few lively shows currently on the TV screen. Mr. Pollac's great discovery had been that while books are always dull, writers can be hilariously funny, when assembled in herds. In fact, he had at last come upon a satisfactory substitute for the wrestling matches on which television networks throughout the world have been relying for years. The show's deficiencies were themselves a reflection of today's cultural scene: It was numerically dominated by representatives of the New Left, who tend to be as stereotyped in their reactions as Mr. Mallé's bourgeoisie. Whenever an independent opinion was voiced, its utterer was hooted down and showered with sarcasms.Something less foreseeable happened: the management of French television, in the name of morality and of the good French public, took a series of measures that eventually amounted to suppressing \\"Post-Scriptum\\" (thereby indirectly but efficiently launching \\"Le Souffle au Coeur\\"—mention of which was forbidden on the air—on the road to popular success). This ill-inspired, dangerous decision—the act of censorship is always more harmful than that which is censored—is in line with the inexorable evolution of French television, once the most creative in the world, toward conformism, an evolution inherent in the systematic, deliberate shift of all responsibilities and powers from creators to civil servants.\\"Les Mariés de L'An Deux\\" (\\"The Spouses of Year Two of the French Revolution\\"), another official entry of France at Cannes, did not need the odor of scandal to become a hit.It had Jean-Paul Belmondo. \\"Les Mariés\\" is a tongue-in-cheek, cloak-and-dagger movie, aimed at family audiences, a genre at which the French are curiously adept and of which \\"Fanfan La Tulipe,\\" starring the late Gérard Philippe, is the classic. Fights, escapes, pursuits against a background of amiable Terror—the episodes flit by so quickly and so weightlessly that the incestuous love of a brother and a sister passes almost unnoticed. But then, we see them no more closely together than riding on the same horse, and there are so many surprising events to take in, not the least of which is the reconstruction, for budgetary reasons, of 18th-century Nantes in 1970 Rumania.It is difficult to imagine a amusing, tender and amoral film than \\"Bof,\\" an exclamation meaning somthing like: \\"So What?,\\" used to express one's smiling indifference to everything from lateness at an appointment to the collapse of values in the Western world.The film illustrates this new paganism. It begins, deceptively enough, at a portrayal of working-class life. A young man become a delivery boy, lugging crate upon crate up steep backstairs. He marries a salesgirl, his mother dies, his father, jobless comes to live with him . . . We begin to realize that the film's maker, Claude Faraldo, has something else in mind than social realism when the father asks his son to let him sleep with his wife, \\"only from time to time, of course.\\" This poses no problem. In fact, nothing does.As every student of surrealism knows, fantasy is effective only when embedded in a context of credibility. Mr. Faraldo intelligently lends both verisimilitude and humor to his anarchist's daydream by putting it in sharply observed proletarian existence and by deriving the most preposterous mischief from the exquisitely drawn affection between father and son. \\"I live off you, I sleep with your wife, I've killed your mother.\\"\\"Bof\\" went almost unnoticed: the censors had neglected to object. If this trend toward increasing liberalism on the part of the Censorship Commission (appointed by the Ministry of Culture) continues, it will soon become necessary to convince the public that talent is the worst of all obscenities.

The first piece is based on a possible real-life model for Dickens's Miss Havisham, the jilted bride who went mad and lived as a recluse in her wedding dress as the marriage breakfast rotted on the table. The poems (by Randolph Snow) are set in a style based on extremes of range, wide leaps, preposterous-looking complexes of fast notes and extensive performance instructions (often calling for ''avant-garde'' vocal techniques of various kinds).   A problem with this is that it very often suggests caricature, and at least stylization, when the musical and dramatic context seem to imply something like naturalism. ''Something like,'' because the shifting tone of the poems does not always suggest the realistic utterance of even a poetic madwoman","excerpt":"still, the notation ties the singer to such an extreme, daffy, weirdo kind of madness that the effect is eventually off-putting rather than poignant or horrifying.

Peter F. Drucker, professor of social science and management at the Claremont Graduate School in California, argues that the world economy is not ''changing,'' but rather that it has already changed in its foundations and structure. Writing in the spring issue of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Drucker stresses three critical changes of the last decade.   First, he says, ''The primary-products economy has come 'uncoupled' from the industrial economy.'' Developing countries once could count on exporting their primary materials - farm and forest products, minerals and metals - to pay for the capital goods of the industrially advanced countries. But the contracting world market for primary materials, in large measure due to changing technology, makes the old premises for economic development highly dubious. Declining world commodity prices have jeopardized the economic development of the third world - and can lead to political as well as economic dangers.
