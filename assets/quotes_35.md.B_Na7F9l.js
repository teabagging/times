There is a seemingly endless list of exhibits, concerts and special events. The city's graceful, tree&#8208;lined canals will be festooned with lights, and Amsterdam is looking forward to a busy year despite predictions that American tourism in Europe will drop sharply in 1975 due to the recession and the declining value of the dollar, which brings slightly under two and one&#8208;half Dutch guilders these days. But the 700th birthday aside, the talk of the town in Amsterdam this year has been about the battle between the city government and a group of long&#8208;haired protesters in the Nieuwmarkt district over the subway under construction. The protesters have been unable to stop the demolition of many old houses in connection with the project, but they seem to have won a major victory, since the city has called off plans that would have extended the subway. The drug problem has worsened since a Chinese&#8208;led heroin ring settled in Amsterdam, bringing gang wars and a rash of bad publicity. Because of the prevalence of drugs, officials have closed the popular Vondel Park for overnight camping this summer. However, there is nothing that could be called a &#8220;crime wave&#8221; gripping the city. All in all, while some observers of the Amsterdam scene maintain the town has lost some of its charisma in the last few years, it still remains the center of the vital, youth&#8208;oriented Dutch cultural life and an extraordinary city where skyscrapers are few and where bicyclists and pedestrians still hold automobile.

In this brief work, 64 pages in the 1980 American edition, an unidentified listener spends sleepless nights ''devising figments to temper his nothingness.''

QUEEN AT HOME\\" MODEST LITTLE PLAY","excerpt":"Amusing Moments in Story of an Actress Whose Relatives Impose Upon Her."},{"year":"1929","title":"The screen translation of Maxwell Anderson's prize play, \\"Saturday's Children,\\" is interspersed with dialogue passages that occasionally boom in a disquieting fashion and others that subside into abashed tones so low that the words of the players cannot always be heard. Although these audible sequences rather detract from the value of parts of the picture, it is a production that is directed with imagination, sympathy and restraint and therefore survives the periodical outbursts of speech.Corinne Griffith, whose beauty has called upon many an adjective in the past, plays the part of \\"Bobby\\" Halvey, which on the stage was acted by Ruth Gordon. Miss Griffith may not shine in the spoken scenes, due to the tempermental microphone, but her work without considering her lines is most commendable. Grant Withers appears as Jim O'Neill, a character which in the original was known as Rims O'Neill, Mr. Withers is capital as the young man who is impelled to propose marriage to \\"Bobby,\\" because he is led to believe that his rival, a mythical Fred, may steal her from him.This pictorial effort was directed by Gregory La Cava, who has not permitted cinematic transmutation to spoil the human quality of the play. Where it is possible. Mr. La Cava has introduced charming touches of gentle comedy. This is especially noticeable in a stretch where \\"Bobby\\" and Jim go to listen to the band in Central Park, a chapter that is really helped by the excellent Vitaphone reproduction of the band music. The two lovers are beheld cheek to cheek, sitting in a chair, Jimmy being sometimes a little bothered by the broad brim of his sweetheart's hat. There is the sudden rush for seats vacated by others, and then Mr. La Cava gives one an amusingly true suggestion of an uncouth individual who has never watched his calories. This adipose person leans across \\"Bobby\\" and asks Jimmy for a light, and soon the smoke from his cigar clouds the girl's pretty face.Albert Conti officiates as Mr. Mengle, who finds himself thinking of \\"Bobby's\\" pretty ankles as he dictates a letter to her. Mengle's thoughts become so confused that he says \\"hosiery\\" when he means \\"overalls.\\" But one understands that this letter taken down by his stenographer is all a blind, for when he passes her desk, after she has gone to lunch, he tears off the sheet of paper on which are the stenographic signs and crumples it up. He is an employer who delights in giving orchids to \\"Bobby.\\"It is at the suggestion of Florrie, an intelligent blonde, that \\"Bobby,\\" somewhat awkwardly, starts the talk about the imaginary Fred. Jimmy was to leave for South America, but so soon as he realizes that somebody else is infatuated with \\"Bobby\\" he decides to abandon the position that would take him away for three years.Mr. La Cava does not invite one to gaze upon a marriage ceremony coupled with the bridal march, but contents himself with depicting the exterior of a church, then a man sweeping away rice and old shoes, and, quite artistically, Mr. La Cava dissolves from the sweeping or the rice to a glimpse of \\"Bobby\\" in her new small apartment sweeping the kitchen floor.The squabbling of the young couple is filmed with restraint and the scenes in which they decide to separate are set forth with a nice vein of humor flashing here and there midst the scowling.Not long afterward, \\"Bobby,\\" back at her old position of stenographer for Mr. Mengle, is perceived dining with her employer. The amount of the restaurant check is $27, which might mean only money to anybody else, but to \\"Bobby\\" it conveys much, for it is the amount of the rent she and Jimmy paid for their humble abode. The $3 that Mr. Mengle hands to the waiter is the same amount that \\"Bobby\\" had returned to Jimmy for the milk bill.Albert Conti is splendid as Mengle and Alma Tell does well in the part of Florrie.Vitaphone short subjects preface \\"Saturday's Children,\\" and one of them, a sketch with Shaw and Lee, causes one to think of the fact that talking comedians can go on their own sweet way whether the audience is entertained or not.

As in other erstwhile monarchies, the duties of his office have been largely reduced to pomp and circumstance. To make matters worse Drottningholm Castle, where he lives with his family, only gets two television channels -- and, this being Sweden, both are noncommercial public stations. A Swedish newspaper reported last week that the King would like to broaden his video horizons by installing a satellite dish antenna to pick up foreign broadcasts. But it seems not even that modest wish is within his circumscribed powers. Swedish cultural authorities decided an antenna would look tacky and detract from the appearance of the 18th-century castle, an important tourist attraction. Installing an underground cable would cost $175,000, too much a strain for the royal treasury to withstand.

We are in the very maw of death and of the opaque mysteries that lie beyond.

Knopf. $24.95.   Many memoirs have been written about the theatrical company that in the 1930's tried to revolutionize American culture. The best known of them are probably \\"The Fervent Years: The Story of the Group Theater and the 30's\\" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich), by Harold Clurman, one of the company's three founding directors, and \\"Elia Kazan: A Life\\" (Knopf), by the Group's most famously successful graduate.   But never before has the whole story been told as meticulously and objectively as Wendy Smith has done in her exhaustive \\"Real Life Drama: The Group Theater and America, 1931-1940.\\" Recognizing in the Group's passionate intensity the sense of political commitment she herself felt in the turbulent 1960's, Ms. Smith has immersed herself in her subject's yearnings and traced its chronicle from start to finish. Unfortunately, her zeal outpaces her ability to breathe life into her story.      The Group Theater's history comprised some two dozen Broadway productions of wildly varying success, annual summer retreats to the country during which the Group members worked at their stage techniques, and endless tergiversation.  Luckily for the content of \\"Real Life Drama,\\" two of the Group's founders, Harold Clurman and Lee Strasberg, stood for important dramaturgical ideals that tended toward opposing poles. (This is in no way meant to slight the third founder, Cheryl Crawford, who somewhat too selflessly took on most of the practical details of sustaining the Group's existence.)   As Ms. Smith summarizes one of Harold Clurman's early \\"rambling, impassioned lectures\\": \\"From his statement of principles, Clurman drew two main conclusions. They had to do with the twin imperatives of art -- form and content -- and it was typical of the sharply contrasting personalities of the two men who pulled their group in often uneasy tandem for seven years that form was Strasberg's bailiwick and content was Clurman's.\\"   Form was essentially acting style, which Strasberg permanently changed in America. Drawing on the techniques developed by Konstantin Stanislavsky in his Moscow Art Theater, Strasberg taught the Group's actors how to build a stage character from their psychic interiors rather than depend on the illusion of physical gesture. Fittingly enough, as Ms. Smith observes, Strasberg's acting revolution came to fruition with the Method style of the self-absorbed 1950's, long after the socially committed 30's. It is a style from which audiences continue to benefit in the best of contemporary cinematic acting.     Content, on the other hand, had to do with the material that the actors performed. Clurman dreamed of turning the Group into a school for content, an institution that would not only embody the political and cultural issues of the day but also develop playwrights to dramatize those issues. Alas for American theater history, all he got for his trouble was Clifford Odets.   True, the passages describing Odets's work with the Group provide the few exciting moments of \\"Real Life Drama.\\" On the night in January 1935 when his famous taxi-strike play, \\"Waiting for Lefty,\\" opened, the playwright, the actors and the audience achieved the \\"near-religious communion\\" of which Clurman dreamed. And subsequent productions of Odets's \\"Awake and Sing!\\" and \\"Paradise Lost\\" must have come as close as anything the Group experienced to what the Moscow Art Theater achieved in its productions of the plays of Chekhov.   But the fact of the matter is that the best of Odets falls far short of Chekhov. Had the Group come up with even a Eugene O'Neill, its history might have been different. Perhaps to have produced a great playwright was impossible, given the stridently political issues of the times.  Whether to go on strike is hardly material for important drama. But in any case the Group didn't, and without a major artist to lead it, it was bound to falter.     Ms. Smith admits \\"that many of the Group's most famous efforts haven't aged well.\\" She adds: \\"It's possible to read 'Lefty' and still be moved by its passion, but it's doubtful that it could be performed today with any credibility. The other Odets plays    can    be done, . . . but too often they're turgid and stagy, with the actors and directors unable to find any living significance in scripts written 50 years ago.\\"   But she neglects to imagine what the nurturing of a great playwright might have meant to the Group, how the birth of a native Sophocles, Shakespeare, Moliere, Ibsen or Brecht might have lifted the company with an innovative, visionary body of drama. Instead she blames the fragility of human relations, and documents their failure endlessly in earnest but drab prose.   Was the Group's work worth all the trouble? On balance, it seems to have been. As Ms. Smith sums up: \\"A distinguished list of productions offered over 10 years","excerpt":"an acting technique that remains enormously influential; a new emphasis on ordinary experience -- these were the Group's specific contributions to the American theater, and they weren't trivial ones.\\"     And as Eunice Stoddard, an original member of the Group, eloquently testifies: \\"Everybody had their frustrations. I stayed because it was more interesting theater than anywhere else. Rehearsals were always so exciting: the whole analysis of the play, of the parts, of what the play was saying in terms of our era, was just so much more stimulating than anything you'd ever get on Broadway. You didn't want to leave that for what you knew you'd be getting outside, which might satisfy your ego as an actress but not necessarily create very interesting theater. It was a very difficult choice.\\"   But \\"Real Life Drama\\" doesn't live up to its author's passion for her subject. Her zealous devotion comes through, but it remains by and large uninspired and uninspiring.

The pieces fall onto a moving conveyor that passes under a magnetized drum, which lifts off the steel and iron. The drum leaves other metals, plastic and miscellaneous materials for hand sorting. The iron and steel chunks are stored in huge piles nearby until they are shipped to steel mills around the world to be made into new products.   This is recycling that works. As governments and industries struggle to establish recycling programs for newspapers, plastics and other household trash, the Prolerized Schiabo Neu Company, a privately held recycling company here, turned 300,000 old cars into high-grade iron ore last year. With scrap at about $90 a long ton, a typical car fetches about $100.

It opened with the group Black Note, a quintet of young musicians from Los Angeles  that takes its inspiration in part from early Wynton Marsalis, meaning its harmonies are modern and a bit acidic. The group set up a changing background for solos, a static chord for one improviser, swinging rhythms for the next. They sounded a bit like a student group, earnest young improvisers moving through their prearranged lines and ideas and never really improvising. The music rarely moved beyond the polite.         The guitarist James (Blood) Ulmer followed. Over the years he has become a self-parodist. He sings on most of his songs now, in a deep, near-Jimi Hendrix growl. Occasionally he played odd and beautiful guitar solos, metallic and compressed. He saved his most ambitious piece for last, a composition that moved from swinging sections to hard rock and never ventured into the banalities of his singing. Mr. Ulmer's sound and his harmonies, pumped through an electric guitar and overdriven amplifier, are sulfuric at times, chilly at others. He's distinct, though his concerts hardly ever let an audience know what he's capable of doing.

But a program of four new and recent pieces, performed by J. Fregalette Jansen Dance on Thursday night at the Whitney Museum of American Art at the Equitable Center, had the feeling of a tour through a country with a language other than one's own. It was clear that something was being said. But the meaning and syntax were largely unintelligible.   Ms. Jansen's \\"Big Bog,\\" a 1989 group work set to music by Bill Ruyle, brimmed with characteristic moodiness and odd buried incident. But her pairing of a new duet called \\"Vinnyettes and Noonyisms\\" with a duet from the 1989 \\"Frankenstein's Smile\\" was puzzling. Each had its own clear tone. Two lovers were locked tight in a reclining, then standing embrace in \\"Frankenstein's Smile,\\" performed by Ms. Jansen and Byron Suber to music by John Zorn. The two lovers in \\"Vinnyettes and Noonyisms,\\" danced to \\"September Song\\" as sung by Jimmy Durante, looked as if they were still getting to know each other, though very happily. Parts of the new duet, danced by Margaret Eginton and Geoffrey Nimmer, alternated with parts of \\"Frankenstein's Smile.\\" It was like mixing eggs and oranges. And why \\"September Song\\"? Its very specific references were not alluded to in the duet.

The group has understandably made many friends among composers, and there were several in its audience on Wednesday evening, when it played an all-American program at the Kathryn Bache Miller Theater at Columbia University.   The works on the program were in a fairly rigorous style, some more than others. But the ensemble proved itself expert at finding the human side of even the most arcane music. The violinist Miwako Watanabe and the cellist Bonnie Hampton played with the warm, rounded tone and thoughtful phrasing one expects to hear in Brahms.

With a simple message -- \\"Gonna dance to the music all night long, getting high, getting happy, getting gone\\" -- the group took over the Ritz on Friday night to play about an hour of live music amid six hours of rave-style dance music and video that looked like reprocessed light shows.   Primal Scream has set out to update both psychedelic rock and the psychedelic impulse, which only partly overlap. Some of Primal Scream's songs are secondhand gospel and secondhand soul, played with sloppy exuberance, just as in 1960's rock. Other songs follow the inclusive psychedelic impulse and embrace later developments, from drum-machine rhythms to disco wah-wah guitar to hip-hop sampling. Vocals are shared by a woman who belts out exhortations like a gospel-trained disco singer and an adenoidal man who provides a bit of earnestness.

A9    7 Killed, 1 Taken in Afghanistan  Two Canadian soldiers in the NATO force were killed and three were wounded in an ambush in southern Afghanistan, an Afghan provincial council member was assassinated on his way to work, two police officers were killed near the border with Pakistan, two civilians were killed by a bomb, and an Italian photojournalist was reported to have been kidnapped by gunmen in southern Afghanistan.

A8    Video Disputes China's Claim  A videotape that appears to show Chinese security forces shooting two Tibetan refugees in the Himalayas contradicts Beijing's claim that the refugees were shot when soldiers acted in self-defense. The New China News Agency said soldiers acted after refugees seeking to cross illegally into Nepal from China attacked border troops. A6    The Chinese police have charged a prominent human rights lawyer with inciting subversion, part of a crackdown on people who have sought to use China's nascent legal system to limit the power of the state.

A16    Coast Guard to Arm Lake Boats  United States Coast Guard officials want to mount machine guns on their cutters and small boats around the Great Lakes as a counterterrorism measure, and plan to hold live fire exercises on the lakes. Some residents of the lakeside towns consider the idea to be potentially dangerous to ordinary boaters and a surprising place to be bracing for terrorists.

Nothing is sacred, much is amusing, and anything goes.   This aspect of American musical life is being celebrated in a six-concert series at the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, that endson Saturday night. The series, organized by Ben Neill, the Kitchen's music curator, doesn't really deserve its Germanic and portentous title, Gruppen II (the subtitle, as for Gruppen I last season, is \\"Chamber Music for the 21st Century\\"). At least on paper, the program promises a mix of jazz, Minimalism, new age, rock, hardware experimentation and art music, which may not produce anything more coherent than an evident determination to avoid too much coherence.

Russian ground officials said they would probably wait for a new crew to arrive before undertaking a space walk to repair the damage.   5    Kenya Arrests 7 for Massacre  Kenyan police arrested seven high-ranking officials in the former Rwandan Government. The officials were accused of being part of a hard-line Hutu elite that planned and carried out genocide against Tutsi civilians in 1994 before the government was overthrown. The arrests were made at the request of the United Nations war crimes tribunal in Tanzania, and suggested warmer relations between Rwanda and President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya.   4    U.S. Pressure Urged on China  The former secretary of Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent political prisoner, said Washington should pressure Beijing to release him or at least to improve his conditions.

(Agence France-Presse)    Canada Laments Overfishing  In a terse missive to Washington, Canada accused the United States of breaching an international treaty by overfishing in Alaska. Alaskan fishermen have caught about 350,000 sockeye salmon bound for Canadian waters so far in 1997, triple the average of previous years, Fisheries Minister David Anderson contended in Ottawa.   (Reuters)    Angry Gorilla Nabs Fugitive  An angry gorilla at the Johannesburg Zoo in South Africa corralled a man who trespassed in his area while trying to flee the police. The suspect shot the 260-pound lowland gorilla, without being able to subdue the animal. The police finally shot the suspect but had to knock the furious gorilla out with a tranquilizer dart during the fracas. The suspect was hospitalized but all other parties escaped serious injury.   (AP)    NATIONAL   6-9    Police Say Murder Spree Began With Cryptic Remark   Just before the killings began, Andrew Cunanan told friends in San Diego that he was flying to Minnesota to ''settle some business'' with an old friend, Jeff Trail. It is perhaps the most tantalizing clue in the mystery of why Mr. Cunanan began what the police call a murderous spree, starting with the killing of Mr. Trail, an engineer, on April 27, and the shooting of another friend, David Madson, a Minneapolis architect, six days later. Mr. Cunanan continues to elude the authorities in the Miami area, where he is wanted in the killing on Tuesday of the fashion designer Gianni Versace.   1     G.O.P. Votes Against Change  Republican Party members endorsed the recommendations of a study group that opposes campaign spending limits, opposing public financing of campaigns, but favors preserving political action committees and continuing to allow parties to raise and spend ''soft money,'' which is often used by the parties to skirt Federal campaign finance regulations.   8     Donor Faces Record Fine  The Federal Election Commission levied a $323,000 fine against a German businessman, the largest penalty ever against an individual for campaign finance violations. In a settlement agreement, Thomas Kramer admitted to making illegal campaign contributions directly, through his businesses and through his secretary to a number of state and Federal party committees and candidates.   8     Bullets Missing in King Case  After a week of searching, prosecutors said they still had not found the bullets fired 29 years ago in F.B.I. tests of the rifle they believe was used by James Earl Ray to assassinate the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Proving that the .30-06 rifle did not fire the shot that killed Dr. King is crucial to Mr. Ray's efforts to win a new trial because his fingerprints were found on the rifle.   7     Gore Defends Balanced Budget  Vice President Al Gore defended the Clinton Administration's drive for a balanced budget against those in his party who say that strict balance is less important than investment and economic growth. While he never mentioned his rival by name, Mr. Gore was clearly answering Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader who is expected to challenge him for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000.   7     New Charges in Army Case  The Army charged its most senior enlisted soldier with sexual misconduct involving a female officer, the fifth woman to come forward since the investigation against him began last February. The woman, a major based in Europe and the first officer to make such accusations, said that in 1994, when she was a captain, Sergeant Major Gene C. McKinney assaulted her on one occasion and asked her to have sex on another, Army officials said.   6     NEW YORK/REGION   21-24     Storms Cause 3 Deaths And Many Power Outages   Severe thunderstorms flashed across the metropolitan region, knocking out power lines and uprooting trees in bursts of rain, wind and lightning that left two people dead in Queens and one in New Jersey. The storms caused power failures from central New Jersey to eastern Long Island.   1     Immigration Law Rejected  A Federal judge ruled that despite a longstanding New York City policy, city workers cannot be forbidden from alerting the authorities if an illegal immigrant is using public hospitals, schools or other city services. The decision marked a setback for Mayor Giuliani, who had sued to restore a city policy that allowed undocumented aliens access to services without fear of being reported to the Federal Government.   21     Successor Sought at CUNY  The chairwoman of the board at the City University of New York, Dr. Anne A. Paolucci, accused the outgoing chancellor of ''virtually lying'' to the trustees, and asserted that the new Chancellor would have to have ''good personal chemistry'' with her. Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds said this week that she had accepted a job as president of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.   23       ARTS   11-17, 20     SPORTS   25-29     Clarke Leads British Open  Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland shot a five-under 66 in the second round of the British Open, putting him at nine under for the tournament: two shots ahead of the American Justin Leonard and three shots ahead of Jesper Parnevik of Sweden.   25     BUSINESS DAY   30-46     Court Reverses F.C.C.

No big political wheels are sent spinning in this musical comedy in color, which turned up at the Cameo Saturday. But it contains more than one hint of good-natured irreverence aimed at minor league functionaries and their strict adherence to party line culture.The story may be as transparent and corny as any low-grade Hollywood song-and-dance melange, but it is performed in a refreshingly modern and gay tempo by young people with tongues in cheeks and hearts in the right places.Their \\"Carnival\\" in one of Moscow's houses of culture is meant to be a cheerfully unrestrained affair. But this prospective New Year's celebration is constantly being threatened by Igor Ilyinsky, the stuffy, unimaginative director who is all for making this a sedate party complete with lectures and staid concertizing. But the young contingent, as may be surmised, manages to keep him at arm's length while their gayer entertainent is put on.There's a romance, of course, involving Lyudmila Gurchenko, a pretty brunette singer, and Yuri Belov, a handsome electrician who is handy at foiling the director but tongue-tied when it comes to professing his love. It's a rudimentary affair that is casually handled.The acts displayed, after all, are the foundation of this offering. There are enough of them to indicate that the Russians are quite aware of the jazz age even if they haven't gotten around to making the most of it as yet. Eddie Rosner and his band belt out a few numbers with vigor and a sprightly beat. The lyrics, as translated in the English subtitles, are of the June, moon genre, but the songs are definitely tuneful.A viewer also might be diverted by the acrobatic ballet professionally turned in by Tamara Kruchova and Igor Lovitak","excerpt":"an American-type buck-and-wing tap dance by a team of brothers, Y. and V.

Everyone seems to be having fun and a fair portion of it is projected.Also on the program is \\"In the Antarctic,\\" a twenty-minute short record filmed by the Central Documentary Studio of Moscow dealing with the Soviet scientific party's arrival at the South Pole base last year in connection with the International Geophysical Year.

Briggs Swift Cunningham II, who was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and lived the majority of his life in Westport, Connecticut, died in Las Vegas, Nevada on July 2, 2003. Mr. Cunningham was the son of a Cincinnati financier and businessman who funded the start-up of Proctor & Gamble. While attending Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut, Briggs developed a love of yacht-racing, which lead him to international recognition when he skippered the Columbia to victory in the 1958 America's Cup yacht race. In the 1930s Mr. Cunningham and two friends formed the Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) to promote racing in the New York area. In 1940 he began designing and building his own cars. After World War II, Briggs founded the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) and competed in his first race at Watkins Glen, New York driving his ''BuMerc''-a hybrid Buick/Mercedes of his own creation. In 1950 Mr. Cunningham began his quest to win the 24 Hours of LeMans race in France. To legitimize the image of American racers, Briggs decided to build his own car","excerpt":"an Americanmade sports car that would be competitive with the best that Europe had to offer. He was the first American to drive an American car in the 24 Hours of LeMans. Teaming first with Cadillac and then with Chrysler and their new ''hemi'' engine, Briggs designed and built the Cunningham car. From the first C-1 to the most successful C4R, the Cunningham cars were marvels of American design and engineering. Briggs Cunningham gained the respect of racers worldwide and created a style of car which served as an inspiration for the Corvettes and Vipers of today. Over the next twenty years, Mr. Cunningham continued to design and build innovative race cars. Through strategic alliances with Jaguar, Maserati and Roger Penske, Briggs continued to enter cars in races worldwide including the 24 Hours of LeMans, the U.S. Grand Prix at Watkins Glen and the Presidents Cup at Virginia International Raceway. Mr. Cunningham was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1997 and into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame this past April. Mr. Cunningham is survived by his former wife, Lucie Bedford Warren, of Westport, Connecticut and their three children, Briggs Swift Cunningham III of Lancaster, Kentucky, Lucie Cunningham McKinney of Westport, Connecticut, and Cythlen Maddock of Palm Beach, Florida, and 16 grandchildren and 29 great-grandchildren.

This journey took more than two hours, traversing the countryside between the capital with its wide boulevards and spacious parklands through small villages where goats wandered free in the streets and into buildings. At the end of this odyssey lay the monastery, preserved in near-perfect condition.

Clara is duller than usual, even though she is given the traditional nutcracker for Christmas and sees him come alive to vanquish the Mouse King. The animation, drawn in storybook pastels, is mediocre, the kind that relies on wide-eyed characters who blink every now and then to show they're alive. Although Tchaikovsky's music weaves in and out of the background, it has little to do with the story.

We defy anybody to cite a cleaner film than this Allied Artists presentation, which has John Derek and Kevin McCarthy engaged in a brotherly tug-of-war over Diana Lynn, one cute dish. Indeed, seldom have so many whole-some, scrubbed-looking young people thronged any picture than they do in this frankly pastel and perfectly legitimate little recruiting poster for our Naval Academy, which bows even lower to puppy love.Filmed partly on location and in color, at least half of the footage gives a picturesque close-up of living quarters, lecture rooms, combat conditioning and the inevitable parades. However, even with its mild, romantic clash, the scenario by Dan Ullman and Geoffrey Homes insists on a suspiciously wide-eyed and optimistic depiction of the regimented trainees. As typified by Messrs. Derek and McCarthy, it's hard to imagine these bounding, entirely harmonious lads ever emerging as realistic defenders of their country in war or peace.The romantic triangle simply threads together the background footage. Losing Miss Lynn to the more gregarious Mr. Derek, Mr. McCarthy sulks (who can blame him?). The two trainees are packed off to Pensacola and finally, in a tacked-on sequence of super-imposed combat flying, to the Korean front, where bravery (it doesn't matter whose) rights the score.Don Siegel directed and Walter Mirisch produced. Alvy Moore, Pat Conway and L. Q. Jones seem hardly less fraternal, in smaller roles, than Messrs. Derek and McCarthy, whose earnestness, as brothers, is underscored by their very appearances.

(Owl/Holt, $10.95.) The book's title derives from a quotation by a 19th-century California horticulturist, who observed that the best zinfandels were similar to angels' visits: \\"few and far between.\\" But this book is about more than the United States' only indigenous fine-wine grape. \\"It weaves history, geography, wine and some of the fascinating people who make it into a downright enthralling tale,\\" Frank J.

A young woman about to be married observes the intricate interweaving of the histories of the participants in her grandmother's quilting circle.
