Four and a half years ago, Mark Haddawy, an owner of the Resurrection vintage boutiques, purchased Pierre Koenig's Case Study House No. 21 (above) in Los Angeles, sight unseen. Now, after essentially curating this 1,320-square-foot steel-and-glass house -- filling it with rare designer furniture, including pieces by Poul Kjaerholm and Craig Ellwood -- Haddawy is moving on. But instead of contacting a real estate agent, he approached Richard Wright, the owner of the auction house, which specializes in 20th-century art and design. ''I thought the house was really better presented as a work of art than as a conventional house,'' Haddawy says. The opening bid for this icon of California Modernism is $2.5 million, almost twice what a similar property by an unknown would fetch in the area. Nearly all of the contents of the house -- the furniture, most of the art, even the 1958 Porsche roadster in the carport -- will be sold as separate lots. ''It's a big step for us,'' Wright says, noting that this is one of the few works of significant modern architecture to be sold by a fine-art auction house (like the Farnsworth House, by Mies van der Rohe, and the Rockefeller Guest House, by Philip Johnson). To honor the event, Wright enlisted Julius Shulman, the Case Study program's original photographer, to shoot a photo essay for the catalog. He also commissioned artists like Catherine Opie and Todd Hido to create a series of images there. ''It's such a nice way to say goodbye,'' Haddawy says. ''It kind of makes it easier.'' Surely the 1956 John Lautner house that he's moving into with his girlfriend, the actress Nora Zehetner, will also help ease the pain.

Fly fishermen - particularly those after trout and Atlantic salmon - are by and large a nostalgic lot, steeped in the history and tradition of their sport, and the forthcoming event, which will take place in Bedford Historical Hall on the village green in Bedford, N.Y., has much to lure them.   Mr. Deren's shop, which was opened on 43d Street around 1940, and later moved to the Chrysler Building, wound up at 141 East 44th Street in 1967, remaining there until his death in 1983. It was a favorite haunt of many of the city's most accomplished fly fishermen. After the highly respected William Mills & Son tackle store - which for more than 70 years had remained in its location at 21 Park Place on the edge of New York city's financial district - closed its doors in the early 1970's, the only places for New Yorkers to seek out first-rate fly fishing gear and fly-tying materials, plus first- rate advice, were the Anglers' Roost and Abercrombie and Fitch. The latter folded in 1977, and between then and the opening of the Orvis Company's Manhattan store in June of last year, the Anglers' Roost, to quote from Austin Francis's book ''Catskill Rivers,'' was ''the only decent tackle shop left in Manhattan'' catering to ''city-based Catskill anglers.''

In the summer of 1976, Mr Herzog read a newspaper article predicting a volcanic eruption on the tropical island of Guadeloupe. A day and a half later he and two cameramen had arrived on the spot all the way from Germany, ready—and peculiarly eager—to photograph the end of the world.What they found were the deserted city of Basse-Terre, packs of starving dogs, snakes that had been frightened out of the mountains and then drowned in the sea, billowing clouds of noxious gas, and an exquisitely unearthly silence.\\"La Soufrière,\\" named for the volcano—which never erupted, although there had been every indication that it would—is Mr. Herzog's brave and unforgettable vision of the wrath of God, informed by the peculiarly ironic logic of catastrophe. At the turn of the century, when a volcano erupted on the nearby island of Martinique, Mr. Herzog explains, the sole survivor was the island's wickedest criminal, because he had been imprisoned underground.Provocative, contemplative and very beautiful, \\"La Soufrière\\" will be shown this weekend and next at the Film Forum, from Thursday through Sunday each time. On the same bill is a later short Herzog film, made for German television, entitled \\"How Much Wood Would a Woodchuck Chuck: Observation on a New Language.\\" The film is a documentary account of the World Championship contest for livestock","excerpt":"auctioneers, conducted in the Amish country of Pennsylvania. The title comes from a tongue-twister that one of the contestants uses to practice.Since the auctioneers' language is unintelligible to anyone save potential cattle buyers, the film becomes a study of gestures, a chance to view the contestants' near-fanatical animation in abstract terms. The auctioneers' absolute dedication to an unfathomable craft has the kind of freakishness that has often fascinated Herzog in the past, and here he once again examines odd behavior with distance and clarity. This is a much slighter film than \\"La Soufrière,\\" but it is still a work of considerable interest. Film: 2 by Werner Herzog:Wrath of God"},{"year":"1958","title":"Bernard P.

This feature, \\"The Showdown,\\" is a tale of the Tampico oil fields, and while George Bancroft and Fred Kohler give praiseworthy performances, the story is frequently open to ridicule. This film was directed by Victor Schertzinger, and it is sadly lacking in an imaginative quality and also true human psychology. Most of the dramatic developments are wrought with little or no suspense and the characters are not given credit for much intelligence.The two principal beings in this production are Carden, a wildcat oil operator, and Winter, Carden's nemesis. Both are men of unusual strength and, while Carden gloats over having knocked out a few of Winter's front teeth in Java, when the big fight comes in this film, Carden is forced to take a good deal of punishment before he knocks out Winter. This tussle is not especially stirring, for, like the other incidents, it has been directed in an unconvincing fashion. Most of this picture is like a rough rehearsal of the intended photoplay and the instructions of the director are noticeable in many of the incidents.There was evidently a good idea in the original story, but it has not been brought out with sufficient force on the screen. Much is made in one episode of a dainty girl coming to that disagreeable section. This young woman, Sibyl Shelton, indulges in whims that are so absurd that they would weaken the story even if the other stretches were filmed more adequately. Sibyl knows that the only other woman in the shack is a gay creature from a dance hall, and yet she appears for her first night meal in this greasy shelter in evening clothes. This idea of living up to the custom of her family is not so unpardonable as what she does subsequently. She has been told that she will get careless about her attire and her appearance, and, therefore Sibyl is seen in negligée, one which she might have worn in her Park Avenue boudoir, just to prove Garden's assertion. Mr. Shertzinger does not improve matters by stressing in close-ups the eyes of the men gazing at Sibyl. One is impelled to think that the ordinary intelligent woman going to such a place would have had sufficient common sense to dress herself more suitably.There are also in the course of this narrative many other points that hinder it from being a worthy achievement. Imagine Neil Hamilton looking threateningly at George Bancroft! Mr. Hamilton appears as if he had dressed for Fifth Avenue only to find that he had by error stepped into pools of mud and oil.The notion of Carden laying down the best hand of cards as a beau geste is not without merit, but even in this scene Mr. Kohler delights in the fact that his shirt is almost torn off his body. Forgiveness is quick in this yarn!Some of the glimpses of the oil machinery are quite good, but others on the same line are unnecessarily artificial.Mr. Hamilton's acting in this film only deserves mention because it is so poor, so utterly wanting in anything approaching natural actions in the circumstances. Evelyn Brent is comely, but either she or Mr. Schertzinger are to blame for her sudden recovery from a frightful struggle, and also for taking silks and laces to this godless spot.Jack Partington's stage offering, \\"Hula Blues,\\" with the intriguing Hawaiian melodies, is ingenious and colorful.

As a documentary study of the Pensacola Naval Air Training station, and its methods of turning raw recruits into seasoned pilots of combat and bombing planes, \\"Wings of the Navy\\" gets off the ground very nimbly, and has a good deal of value, interest and even excitement, of the purely mechanical sort, to offer to the curious.The United States Government, which always cooperates so beautifully witht he Warners in these affairs, most obligingly trots out dozens of the navy's speedy two-seaters and flying dreadnoughts, its ground crews, with their fascinating apparatus for launching and landing seaplanes, together with some very smart exhibitions of the operative technique and discipline of combat flying. All in all, the educational part is so interesting that we return to the romantic part—in which Olivia de Havilland switches her affections from George Brent, the older brother, to John Payne, the younger brother (both stanch flying men) with a feeling almost akin to pain. Frank McHugh does what he can to prove that the Flying Service has a sense of humor, too.At the Teatro Latino\\"Mexico Lindo,\\" the new Mexican visitor at the Teatro Latino, certainly deserves its name. For this celluloid musical revue is \\"lovely\\" in every way and is a credit to Ramon Pereda, who produced and directed it and also played the part of the \\"hero,\\" as well as to the Mexican cinema industry as a whole.Never before has the popular Adriana Lamar looked as charming as in this elaborate, not to say gorgeous, production. From the time she is shown as a simple ranch girl of the better type until her triumphant appearance on a white horse in the final scenes of the revue she is a joy to the eye. Her singing of the theme song is pleasant, although several other members of the huge cast are more efficient in the musical line. The comedy is well taken care of by Chucha Camacho, as Adriana's peasant companion on her trip to Mexico City, and by Antonio R. Frausto and Leopoldo Beristain, the latter in one of the rural characters he made famous on the Mexican stage some years ago.The story is the usual one about the victory of the honest boy and girl over the city slickers, but it serves well as the framework for what is one of the most entertaining and best made, in the technical sense, pictures ever to cross the Rio Grande on the way north.At the 86th Street CasinoJust why the Berna film producing concern should have placed such an army of Teuton stars at Director Veit Harlan's disposal for the turning out of \\"Alles fuer Veronika,\\" the nice little comedy romance now at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre, is not apparent. Perhaps it was so that Veronika could have \\"everything\\" she wanted and then again perhaps it was because good scripts are scarce in the Third Reich.At any rate, the cast of this uncomplicated tale of a department store salesgirl, well acted by the really \\"cute\\" and appealing Thekla Ahrens, a comparative newcomer to the Yorkville screen, who borrows a silver fox neckpiece to impress her boy friend (Willy Eichberger) on a week-end trip to the mountains, contains Walter Jannssen, Gretl Theimer, Hans Moser, Theo Lingen, Grete Weiser, Hubert Meyerink and Hilda Hildebrand, not to mention a few other first-rate players.Needless to say, they make the best of the comic situations and amuse the audiences a great deal.At the 86th St. Garden TheatreMagnificent views of the beauties of the Tyrolean Alps and a not too complicated story of rural love, a city slicker and smuggling are combined by Director Peter Ostermayr to make a fairly entertaining picture of \\"Der Edelweisskoenig,\\" the new UFA production at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre. The film is based on a popular novel by Ludwig Ganghofer and the name is justified by having the heroine (pretty Hansi Knoteck) tell bedtime tales about the King of the Edelweiss to a couple of bright children.The action revolves around the frustrated romance of a mountain girl (the attractive Ingeborg Wittmann) with a visiting count (Rolf Weih) and the sincere but restrained mutual affection of handsome Paul Richter as a talented wood carver, and Hansi in the role of a country maiden. There is no real tragedy in the piece and in the end Ingeborg finds consolation in the honest love of a young forester (Gustl Stark-Gstettenbauer, now too big for the half-grown boy parts he used to play so well). The acting is good all around.

George C. Wolfe is expected to direct the play, about the Louisiana Purchase, as he was scheduled to do at the Public. The Public canceled its production in November 2008.
