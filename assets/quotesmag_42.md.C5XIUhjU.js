For this new venture, he has curated over 2,000 rare and first-edition tomes on 20th-century literature, art, photography and design, with pulp fiction thrown in -- ''my own anti-canon,'' he explains. ''The goal is to show the productions of an elite art culture with their popular counterparts: Jackson Pollock besides James Dean, Frank Stella with Robert Crumb, Robert Frank against Nobuyoshi Araki.'' Cultural ephemera will range from a prototype of the drafting desk that Marcel Breuer gave to Walter Gropius to a porcelain beatnik figurine that declares, ''It's     not my bag, man!'' McWhinnie's art-world connections will also come into play. Exhibits will include one by the Warhol superstar Brigid Berlin, who will show her crime-scene needlepoint, and another by Richard Prince (with whom he's working on a book catalog, ''Hippie Punk 1967-1977''). Coffee-table posing aside, rare books are a good investment.

Though neither one is exactly light beach fare, both volumes make for absorbing reading -- as lucid and compelling as they are provocative.   Mr. Kernan's book takes the broader view of the situation. As he sees it, serious literature today has \\"almost no presence in the world\\" outside the university: literacy rates are declining, libraries are threatened by financial cutbacks, and books have become commercial commodities overshadowed by television and movies. Within academia, he adds, literature faces equally fearsome threats: in the last decade or so, feminists have denounced it as a tool of male domination, Marxists have assailed it as a capitalist institution, and deconstructionists have devalued it as a relativistic collection of signs.

''We do not study Marxism-Leninism because it is pleasing to the eye or because it has some mystical value,'' he said. ''It is only extremely useful.'' The relationship between Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese revolution was the same as the relationship between an arrow and a target: if it makes no sense to shoot arrows carelessly into space, neither does it make sense to ''take an arrow in hand, thrust it back and forth, and say again and again in praise, 'Excellent arrow, excellent arrow,' and never shoot it at all.''

The story, such as it is, gracefully combines elements of ''The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' and ''Charlotte's Web,'' while the airy watercolor illustrations are both beautiful and accurate.

(Ages 5 to 9) There isn't much action in this book, as its title implies -- after all, it's a virtual gallery of speckled, bright yellow, pale blue, perfectly round and all other kinds of eggs. But each page invites close study, just in time for Easter: kids will enjoy learning that ''seabird eggs are pointy at one end, so . . . they roll around in safe little circles, not off the cliff'' and that many reptile eggs are ''soft and rubbery.''

Like most people, I lug along far too many books that will never be cracked open. On tables and on chairs they make a strange new place seem more familiar. Books are inanimate objects with a soul. More than any piece of furniture, they breathe life into empty space.   In the Renaissance, people understood the power of books as potent architectural elements. Walls of books pivoted as doors to secret passages. Hollowed-out volumes hid important documents. If a collection was too sparse, an artist painted in more. Illuminated manuscripts -- the age's equivalent to modern-day coffeetable books -- sat open on thick moldings running around the room: out of the way, beautiful to behold.   Today, books are seldom an integral part of design","excerpt":"bookshelves are tacked on rather than built in. One ingenious exception I've seen is at a family-style summer camp in Maine. In the dining hall, a vast library literally hangs above the tables. Grids of shelving, suspended from the ceiling, are packed with books, forming text-filled coffers, with a light bulb in the center of each square. A guest can stand atop a chair and be surrounded by volumes arranged according to the old Dewey Decimal System. The walls are also lined with books, making for tremendous competitive conviviality during meals, as diners rush to confirm some naggingly elusive fact: How long can beavers stay underwater?

An Armenian-made musical drama called \\"The Heart Sings\\" makes ordinary viewing, while underscored by a splendid sound track and a silvervoiced tenor who could teach Marte Lanza plenty. But it is two young faces, in an Indian-made film called \\"Boot Polish\\" that are really going to haunt American audience.For this drama of two starving urchins in contemporary Bombay is a lovely picture, a sweet picture. There are few from anywhere, let alone the land of the Ganges. Watching the professional unfolding of this saddening little tale, and the acting of two extraordinary children named Rattan Kumar and Baby Naaz, one can only wonder what the Indian studios have been up to the last decade. For \\"Boot Polish\\" marks that country's first English - titled, commercial showing here, at least in the mid-town area, since the unsensational \\"Shakuntala,\\" back in 1947. Movies in India have come a long way.This Hoffberg release has not the harrowing power and honesty of the somewhat similar Italian \\"Shoe Shine,\\" as was heralded. \\"Boot Polish\\" is no such milestone. However, in a subtly effective way, a gifted man named Raj Kapoor, the writer-producer, is sensitively scorning a society that offers despair (charity) instead of hope (work) for two tiny outcasts \\"of tomorrow\\" whose lives are \\"darker than night.\\" And indeed they are.Forced to become beggars for their vicious, prostitute aunt, the orphaned girl and boy secretly become bootblacks, under the encouragement of a friendly vagrant. Denied even this new respectability, as their sponsor is jailed (for bootlegging), the starving tots are circumstantially pried apart and finally reunited in a scene that will have more than one adult stealing a good, long gulp.For the lonely love of the two children for each other and the agony of their separation, beautifully conveyed by the young actors and Prakash Arora, their director, comes across with uncanny exactitude. Glum as it may sound, the picture has welcome humor, especially toward the beginning, with Miss Kumar chirping away like a contented magpie while briskly ruining one pair of shoes after the other. One viewer loved this little lady and does not care who knows it.Technically the import is spic and span, nicely photographed in a teeming metropolis, and shrewdly upholstered, when needed, with exotic, native music, as the incidents flow evenly. The adults are almost as good as the children, including Mr. Kapoor himself, as the vagrant (and his own protesting mouthpiece), and the four other uncredited principals. If this Indian present makes a final, rather illogical lunge toward sentimentality instead of tragedy, it still holds its sweetness and power.

With some, there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason for their sudden burst, and they usually fade as fast as they appear. Slap-bracelets are a recent example.  But cowboy boots are different.   Women have worn cowboy boots for some time, but it's hard to miss their increasing popularity. Everywhere, it seems, young women strut in footwear that has strayed far from the range.    These boots come in a lot of versions and are usually midcalf high or chopped off at the ankle bone. Often they are decorated with insets or perforated designs.    The block heel is thick and cantilevered like a man's. The toe must be long and pointy, and the sole must be thick.   One suspects that the boot's success with women has less to do with its sturdiness than with its origins. It's part and parcel of a romantic American vision. Then there's the subtle charge a woman gets from wearing a bit of men's attire. Ask a wearer and you might get an earnest answer like, \\"They're earthy,\\" or, \\"They do positive things to my posture\\" (though they probably do not).    More to the point would be the comment made by one beautiful young woman as she swiveled past in her blue jeans and boots: \\"You feel taller, stronger and louder. In cowboy boots, you strut and swagger. You are definitely not vulnerable.\\"   In other words, cowboy boots are sexy. Maybe they're just one of today's ways of signaling the ancient, universal message.

The details are so inhuman and so notably based on well-searched facts that the veriest illustration of them cannot help but shake the heart and nerves.Such is the case, beyond question, with this earnest and fiercely sincere film which had its American premiere at the Little Cine Met yesterday. Just by the physical re-enactment and simulation of episodes which did—or even might have occurred in Warsaw during the dark and anguished years of the war—it stirs the imagination and a consequent emotional response. But, in candor, it must be acknowledged that the actual dramatic quality of the film is poor.This is not due to meager details or productive facilities. With both the picture's makers were plentifully supplied. As a matter of fact, so many details and so many threads of plot have been gathered together in the picture that overcrowding is one of its faults. Endeavoring to follow several families that live in one Warsaw block, Jews and Gentiles together, both before and during the terrible strife, the story jumps so often and becomes so voluminously involved that no absorbing interest, let alone sympathy, is sustained.No sooner has a Jewish family been introduced and observed than the camera sweeps in a Gentile family, anti-Semitic in prejudice, then on to a pro-German family, a doctor's household and so on down the street. And each family has its children, which further complicates the plot. The complex of personal disposition is elaborate, to say the least.And the quality of performance, as well as syntax, under the direction of Alexander Ford, is expansive and uncoordinated. Most of the acting is violently inflamed, with very little consistency in any one major role. A young lady named Broniewska comes closest to maintaining restraint as the doctor's well-bred daughter who discovers, as the story evolves, that she's a Jew. But even she goes off the deep end in some of her agonized scenes. The rest in a large cast of actors have alarming degrees of range.However, in isolated moments, the film strikes electrifying sparks, such as the moment of ultimate parting between a condemned father and his son, or a glimpse of Jewish children in the ghetto or a brave defiance by a simple Polish boy. And all of the film stirs speculations which one's own sympathies may variously expand. Those who recently have read John Hersey's eloquent novel, \\"The Wall,\\" will find a particular affinity in the illustrative details of this film.A standard foreword by Quentin Reynolds and English subtitles for the Polish dialogue serve to articulate a great deal of rambling action that bleakly documents one vast crime.

Spiritual descendants of Jean Seberg's American expatriate in Jean-Luc Godard's \\"Breathless,\\" they are driven by wanderlust, along with vague dreams of American-style glory that aren't likely to pan out. When not working at their boring day jobs in video stores and postcard shops, they sit around wondering where to go next and complaining about how claustrophobic they feel in San Francisco. Their romantic couplings seem more perfunctory than enthusiastic.    Early in the film, Christophe (Charlie Homo), a Frenchman who has taken a job parking cars, sullenly confides his fantasy of conquering the American Wild West in a big flashy car. Instead, he complains, here he is, eating croissants for breakfast. The movie's liveliest scene takes place when he is fired from his job, steals a customer's car and takes Stella (Clara Bellino), a Swiss cabaret singer, and her bisexual pal Maria (Diviana Ingravallo) to New Orleans. Although Christophe disappears from the film, it is revealed later that he was arrested and deported to Haiti.

And Kitchen, 218 Eighth Avenue (at 21st Street), is flying in the freshly picked peppers and sells them for $4.95 a pound. Hatch chili peppers, on the mild side, are about four inches long and wide enough to stuff. What's New in Mushrooms    Smoked mushrooms are new on the food scene. They are slightly moist and chewy, like sun-dried tomatoes, and are best moistened before use.    Shiitakes in six flavors are made by Franklin Foods, in North Franklin, Conn. The more sharply seasoned varieties like maple spice, bayou spice, teriyaki and Italian are better than the somewhat acrid-tasting hickory and boubon. Zabar's, at 80th Street and Broadway, has them in four-ounce packages for $6.95.   Durham's Tracklements in Amherst, Mass., has whole portobello mushroom caps three to four inches in diameter with a nice smoky taste. They can be used whole or slivered in various dishes and, without prior soaking, are even good sliced in a salad. The caps are $3 each, with a minimum of three caps, plus $3 shipping. They can be ordered by calling (800)844-7853.  TriBakery Opens    TriBakery, 186 Franklin Street (near Greenwich Street), opens for retail business today. It is something of an ultra-bakery with heavy-hitting backers like Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Bill Murray, Luther Vandross and the peripatetic Drew Nieporent. The actual baking for TriBakery occupies the lower level, with David Norman from Grand Central Bakery in Seattle and David Blom from Montrachet in charge. There is also an informal 125-seat restaurant, retail counters with baked goods, ice cream, prepared foods and sandwiches, plus a coffee and liquor bar. Free Cider, Bargain Ice Cream    Food events this weekend include a free cider festival from noon to 5 P.M. Sunday at Applewood Winery, 82 Four Corners Road, Warwick, N.Y., near Woodbury Commons For information: (914) 986-1684. And ice cream prices will be rolled back to 1950 -- 25 cents a scoop -- on Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. at Vivian's Kitchen, a just-opened but authentically old-fashioned ice-cream parlor at 10 Prospect Street, in Westfield, N.J. Moving Further Downtown    Broadway Panhandler has moved from Broadway and Spring Street to 422 Broome Street (near Wooster Street). The new double loft space is well-stocked with cookware, baking utensils, cake decorating equipment and kitchen machines. Off the Menu 50 Restaurants on the Way    Unlike some past seasons, this fall promises to be a time of feeding frenzy for food groupies who love to be the first in the reservation books. About 50 new restaurants, from Wall Street to Harlem, are likely to open by the end of the year.   Newly open and running are 13 Barrow, 13 Barrow Street (Seventh Avenue South), with John Tesar, formerly of the Inn at Quogue in Quogue, L.I., as chef","excerpt":"Borgo Antico, 22 East 13th Street, rustic Italian; Motown Cafe, 104 West 57th Street, in a former Automat, offering homage to the Supremes, among others, and Bay Leaf, 49 West 56th Street, interpreting Indian cuisine. In the newly renovated Kitano New York, 66 Park Avenue (at 38th Street), is the first American branch of Nadaman Hakubai, specializing in kaiseki tasting dinners. Nadaman Hakubai has a dozen branches in Japan and five elsewhere in Asia.

Chefs on the Move    Jean-Jacques Rachou, gearing up for next month's opening of La Cote Basque, has signed Richard Leach, who has worked at Aureole and Symphony Cafe, as his pastry chef. And at the Mark Hotel, Raymond Bickson, the director, has hired Christophe Barbier as chef for Mark's Restaurant. Mr. Barbier who trained and worked in France, had been the chef at Fiorello's.

That has certainly been the case with Borland International Inc., which has been beset with losses, layoffs and lawsuits as it labored to deliver upgrades of its mainstay products like the Paradox and dBase data-base management programs. Its newest product, Delphi, which ships this week, could be the company's last and best hope for renewed prosperity, if not continued survival.   Delphi is a visual programming tool. That means software developers can create applications to run on Microsoft's Windows operating system by point-and-click and drag-and-drop commands rather than writing thousands of lines of computer code from scratch. Some coding is still necessary, and this is definitely not a product for end-users, but tools like Delphi can speed the programmer's task considerably. A corporate in-house programmer, for example, might use Delphi to create software for tracking purchasing orders.

The stock fell $3.75, to $13.375, in Nasdaq trading of almost 4.1 million shares. Borland, which is based in Scotts Valley, Calif., said sales of its desktop software had  been surprisingly sluggish. To bolster sales, Borland plans to offer a $100 rebate on its Delphi Desktop software in the United States until Sept. 30. Sales of the software have been lower than expected, Borland said.

As resident Recording Angel here, we will tot up the accounts on both sides of the ledger from the standpoint of its publishing history. First the good news. Mr. Colson turned down five&#8208;figure offers from several major publishing houses and instead took his book, for considerably less advance money, to a small firm in Lincoln, Va., called Chosen Books. Since Chosen Books is actually an editorial packaging or manuscript preparation firm, specializing in religious books, &#8220;Born Again&#8221; is distributed by Fleming H. Revell, an old established religious publisher which is far from a devout band of amateurs, having published a whopping best seller called &#8220;The Total Woman.&#8221; Then too, on the commercial side, Mr. Colson is off on a major two&#8208;months, promotion tour. On the other hand, Mr. Colson's tour is being plannedaround his busy schedule of lectures, fees from which he donates to his prison ministry. Of course, with all the publicity the book could make a lot of money; but on still another hand, Mr. Colson says he will also donate part of his book royalties to the Fellowship Foundation, a group of Washington Christians who sponsor prayer breakfasts and other good works.
