The withdrawal is overshadowed by the separation barrier, which has restricted the flow of people and goods to and from Israel. ''The wall is the dominant factor in the revival of the economy of the West Bank,'' said Mr. Shearer.  ARCHIE TSE    A more contiguous area  There will be a decreased need for a significant military presence in the areas around the emptied settlements because there are no settlers to defend, said Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. Civilian and criminal matters are to be handled by Palestinians.    Improved movement  The main routes to the four settlements became barriers between the surrounding Palestinian areas. Getting from one side of the road to the other often required passing through checkpoints that could have unpredictably long delays. Travel has been improving since this spring because Israeli forces have been decreasing the number of checkpoints in the area.    Limited crossings to Israel  The barrier has limited the number of crossing points. Currently most goods are funneled through the Jalama crossing.    A struggling economy  Before the separation barrier was built, much of the area's economy depended on commerce with Israel, with a quarter of West Bank workers employed there. Since the barrier's construction, the economy has become more localized and unemployment has jumped as workers tried to find jobs close to home.    Map of West Bank highlights the following:    UNDER ISRAELI CONTROL  Built-up area  Settlement area  Other Israeli area    Palestinian civilian control, Israeli security control    UNDER PALESTINIAN CONTROL  Other Palestinian area  Built-up area    SEPARATION BARRIER  Built  Under construction or route approved  Needs further approval  Evacuated settlements    (Sources by Map boundaries from B'Tselem","excerpt":"U.N.
