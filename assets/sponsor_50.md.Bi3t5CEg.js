It was near the Union Flag tavern from which Major André set forth to meet Benedict Arnold and where Nathan Hale was brought to trial. In commemoration of these events the auditorium of the Little Picture House is modeled after the room in which the historic events occurred.The motion picture house is said to be the first built for sound pictures, the walls of the auditorium being covered with acoustic plaster to render a perfect reproduction of tone.Christmas Waits Sing Carols.Last night the heating system was not yet in full operation, and large tin urns in which coal fires smoldered were in evidence. Women in ermine wraps sat huddled in their seats, the furs gathered closely about their shoulders. Most of the men kept on their overcoats and scarfs. The audience, however, remained to the end of the program and applauded each feature. Most of them seemed to think it good fun.The program included three Christmas Waits, portrayed by Francis German, Carl Theman and Kurts Bronell, who sang carols. This was followed by a series of short films, two of which were sound cartoons. A travel picture, a cowboy singing film and several others completed the series.The feature photoplay was \\"The Unwritten Law,\\" a British sound film production, which was directed by Sinclair Hill and in which Ion Swinley and Rosalie Fuller were featured. The picture is a drama of the Scottish moors, in which the actors talk in provincial dialect.To Be Opened to Public Tomorrow.The same program will be repeated tonight for the members of the Film Bureau and the stockholders and at 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon the theatre will be opened to the public. A special program for children will be shown at 10:45 on Friday morning.The reception committee for the premiere included Dr. George Reid Andrews, Miss Miriam P. Blagden, Mrs. Ludlow S.

But today it has grown beyond its modest asphalt roots to become one of the borough's major power brokers.   Umma -- the name is derived from the Arabic word for community -- began as an informal group of eight Muslim families who would pray together and then discuss the problems of their North Flatbush community. Those discussions led to the formation of a civilian patrol that, at its inception, was \\"well-intentioned but very green,\\" said Ed Powell, who founded the group along with James Burns.    As the patrol grew, so did its visibility and its reputation as a group able to effect change. As a result, residents and community groups in Midwood and North Flatbush now rely on Umma for services ranging from ousting drug dealers from apartment buildings to helping landlords collect rent from delinquent tenants to running a day care center.    Umma seems to reach into every corner of central Brooklyn -- it trains civilian and tenant patrols, administers a playground on behalf of the Parks Department (which named the playground Umma Park after the group rid it of suspected drug dealers) and sponsors youth leadership and recreation programs. Mr. Powell himself is directly involved in several political or civic groups and is second vice chairman of Community Board 14.   Mr. Powell's political experience has paid off. Umma can call on, and get results from, such sources as the local police precinct commander and political representatives up to former Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, who donated $3,000 in equipment. In return, these sources gain a liaison with Umma's constituency, much of which has been historically distrustful of government and police.   \\"Their credibility is very strong,\\" said Inspector Patrick D. Brennan, commander of the 70th Precinct.   Mr. Powell and Mr. Burns concede that cooperation with government and police officials has cost them support among those who preferred the group's initial militant posture, when they patrolled the streets in military fatigues. But Mr. Powell contended that critics -- like those who denounced the group for trying to mediate a peaceful end to a well-publicized boycott against a Korean grocery store owner in late 1991 -- are \\"not really from the area.\\"   Within the area, residents heap praise on Umma.   \\"They're doing the job most of our political people and the police should do,\\" said Billy Huston, president of the Committee for a Better and Safer Nostrand Avenue, a civilian patrol in Midwood.   \\"Ed and Jim probably have been more responsible for keeping Flatbush together than anyone I know,\\" said Larry Jayson, associate director of the Brooklyn Tenants Council.   But with success have come potential pitfalls. As even its proponents are quick to admit, mounting expectations could force the organization either to cut back to preserve its effectiveness -- potentially alienating already disgruntled citizens -- or to concentrate more of its efforts on building a more structured organization. That, they fear, could destroy the activist, grass-roots spirit that has been at the heart of Umma's strength.    Michael Clark, executive director of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a nonprofit organization that assists and trains neighborhood groups, predicted that organizations like Umma will be called on to do more as the city trims back social services. Even though they know they may not have the resources to take on these responsibilities, Umma and other community groups often find it difficult to say no, said Mr. Clark.    Indeed, Mr. Powell and Mr. Burns relish their roles as guardians of the street. Even though they have discontinued regularly scheduled patrols, they still carry walkie-talkies in order to respond on a moment's notice to a call from one of the many patrols their organization has assisted -- although these days, calls for help tend to be less urgent. .   \\"It could just be one of the seniors needs someone to go to the store,\\" Mr. Powell said.

A1    Millions of Roman Catholics from St. Peter's Square to the pews of Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago interrupted their day to stand vigil and offer prayers for the pope.

A9    Keeping Tabs on Foreign Views  Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg embraced the practice of consulting foreign legal decisions, rejecting the conservative argument that United States law should not consider international thinking.

Here is a Russian film without symbolism, one that is compelling through the intense performances of the participants, who don't seem to be pretending, but actually going through the furies and friendships in this story of the Cossacks driving the Moslem tribe of Tchetchens from their mountain village, across the border into Turkey. In the manner in which this film is photographed and also in some of the action, it recalls the Cooper-Schoedsack production, \\"Grass.\\"Like nearly all the Soviet motion pictures there is here a message of hate, this time directed at the Czar's emissaries and at the Cossacks. The film was photographed in the Caucasian region and was directed by N. Shengelai. The Sovkino thought so well of his work that he was entrusted with the direction of another picture, called \\"The Tragedy of Twenty-six Commissars in the Prairies of Turkestan.\\"The characters in this present offering, whether they be Tchetchens or the men in uniforms, are lifelike, and the director goes so far as to give a fair view of a few of the Cossacks, at least one of whom shows that he has a soft spot in his heart.There is a little exaggeration in the fight that a Christian, Vazhia, has with the General, who is finally forced to sign a paper rescinding the order of the Tchetchens' expulsion from their mountain abode. In the meantime the Cossack billeting master has tricked the tribesmen into signing another document, one virtually pleading permission to leave their village. Most of the Tchetchens can't write, so they rub their thumbs on the smoked bottom of a kitchen pot and then press them below the signatures of the elder and one or two others.In one finely wrought sequence the Cossack chief gives the order to charge the villagers, who are squatting with bowed heads in the road-way, but the horses apparently refuse to obey the spurring and lashing of some of the troops.Many of the \\"shots\\" of the mountain paths with a winding throng of people are tremendously stirring. They cause one to think of the authenticity of the background and how much it means to the picture and also of the long reach of the camera lens in this rarefied air.The melodramatic notion of a girl returning and setting fire to the village is by no means as effective as the more believable sequences.A. Imadashvilli is sincere as the Elder. Possibly the finest performance of this picture is that of the billeting master of the Cossack troop. He is portrayed by K. Guryanov. Kira Andronikashvilli is splendid as the Elder's daughter, who sets the village ablaze. A. Georgeoliany, with an extraordinary fuzzy mustache, gives a thoughtful interpretation of the Cossack General.Another worthy film, a short one, is \\"Paris at Night,\\" in which the producer, has seized upon electric light signs and silhouettes to make a sparkling study after dark in a big city.

But the Spanish-language edition, made in Mexico, which arrived at the Belmont yesterday, fails for general audiences because of its departure from the structure of the original. And, as it is being presented without English titles, non-Spanish-speaking viewers may find the tragic adventures of the hunted Jean Valjean only a fog of Latin dialogue and gestures.Set in the revolutionary Paris of 1831, the story opens and is concerned mainly with the declining years of Valjean's life. Such episodes in his harried career as the pursuit through the sewers of Paris and Javert's ultimate suicide also have been altered slightly to fit the contours of this new adaptation. And Valjean's early history is summarily depicted in a series of flashbacks toward the end of the picture. Domingo Soler, a member of a Mexican acting dynasty, makes the ageing, hunted Valjean a resolute and forceful figure, while Antonio Bravo plays his relentless hunter, Javert, as a man possessed.

It tells of a little old lady, mother of a middle-aged daughter and sons, who slowly and sweetly moves off center after her hard-working husband dies, and enjoys herself to the fullest in the last few months of her life.From the lugubrious aura of the funeral and the dolor of her first weeks alone, she tentatively starts going places—to the movies, to department stores, on rides around the Marseilles harbor in an old-fashioned horse-drawn cab, spending the little money that her worrying children dole out to her and even taking up with certain off-beat people whom her bourgeois sons consider scandalous.It is the story of a gentle, patient woman who, in the late evening of her life, discovers the simple pleasures of the limited modern world in which she lives and the unimagined excitement of nonconformist companionships. And in her discovery of these pleasures— her \\"shameless\\" behavior, as it is thought—is shown the mistake and the selfishness of the attitude her children have toward her.Mr. Allio has presented this story, which he got from Bertolt Brecht, in a limpidly realistic format that fuses its own stark poetry with the glowing interior poetry that flows from the old lady and her friends. And he has the fine French actress, Sylvie, to play the leading role in a manner that should etch it forever on the memories of those who see the film.The sparkle with which her old lady begins to see the world after years of drudgery and sadness have put weariness and dejection in her eyes, the wonder that forms in her expression and the spring that comes into her step as she warms to her new enjoyments are but part of Sylvie's art. She has the great skill of being able to make us sense and comprehend a human soul.And, under Mr. Allio's direction, others are alive and luminous, too—Malka Ribovska as a skinny, young semiprofessional prostitute who becomes the close companion of the granny and the antithesis of her dull sons","excerpt":"Victor Lanoux as a grandson who is sullenly torn between a dutiful life in his father's trucking business and the fun of playing guitar in a band; Jean Bouise as an expansive and humanitarian socialist, and any number of others, including Etienne Bierry and François Maistre as the sons.The humor and compassion in this study of the personal involvements of old age should make it especially attractive to older citizens, and its tenderness and joy should commend it to the feelings of younger people, too. It reminds me very much of \\"Make Way for Tomorrow,\\" a film about the valor and love of an old couple, that was shown some 30 years ago.Happily, Jean Ferrat has given it a spirited and tender musical score, and good subtitles are provided for the colloquial French dialogue.

He is traveling a deeply rutted road in spinning a familiar story of military duty versus the dictates of the heart. But the horsemanship never was better, the Indians more dastardly and the cavalry never answered a bugle call more quickly.To be specific, Mr. Ford herein is dealing with Colonel Yorke, a tough swordsman who finds that soldiering can be pretty frustrating. There are orders from top brass prohibiting the pursuit of marauding Apaches across the Rio Grande into Mexico. Then there is the matter of his son, a stripling he hasn't seen in fifteen years, who is flunked out of West Point, enlists and is assigned to the colonel's regiment. Then again, there is his estranged wife, a Southern lady still bearing a smoldering resentment against her mate for having burned down the family mansion during the unpleasantness between the States, who is on hand to try and wean her offspring away from the Army life.Suffice it to say that the colonel, with an assist from none other than General Sheridan—who happens to be the colonel's pal ever since that march down the Shenandoah Valley—routs the Reds. His son, it might be added, wins his spurs (figuratively speaking) and the colonel's lady begins to see eye to eye with her husband and the Union—beg pardon—United States Army.Despite the fact that this ungallant observer occasionally was roubled during the unfolding of this father-son relationship by strange reminiscences of such films as \\"Lives of a Bengal Lancer,\\" these were random thoughts completely dispelled by actionful sequences set against a background of sweeping mesas and towering buttes. Include among the latter an Apache raid of the outpost to free their imprisoned tribesmen, an attack of a wagon train bearing the fort's women and children and the climactic assault by the regiment on the Indians' hideout.Obviously realizing that he could not employ boys to do men's jobs, Mr. Ford used, for the most part, case-hardened veterans who have aided him in other footnotes to history. John Wayne is fine as the colonel, a taciturn fighting man, who loves his wife and son but one who is ready to state that \\"on the official records you're my son, on this post you're just a trooper.\\" Maureen O'Hara is decorative as his wife and Claude Jarman Jr. does a competent stint as the son determined to make good.

For 64 years, she reigned as monarch, arbiter of taste and symbol of permanence for a country in flux. Britain was experiencing growing pains because of the Industrial Revolution. The expanding middle class, without traditions of its own, looked toward the sovereign as a model of manners and style. Ostentation was universal - in architecture, furniture and uncomfortably exaggerated gowns. At the table, excess reached its pinnacle. Favored by a royal sweet tooth, desserts and tea snacks spiraled to lofty heights as a showcase for talent and new equipment. From biscuits and bombes to trifles and puddings, Victoria relished each sugary creation.\\n\\nThat the Queen loved desserts was not surprising. The Royal Receipt Book she inherited from her Aunt Charlotte was filled with regal sweets dating back to Anne Boleyn. Prince Albert's German ancestors were similarly inclined. Victoria found great pleasure in the wifely arts of cooking and baking. In their private apartments at Windsor Castle, the Queen turned out almond bars and poppy-seed cakes to please her husband, and puddings, jams, candies and pastries for her children. Of the many recipes she added to the royal cookery book, three-quarters were for sweets.
