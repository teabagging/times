From the time of explosion the five survivors, calling themselves the Weather Underground, have eluded the authorities and carried on what they term \\"armed propaganda.\\" This has consisted of a number of bombings—no injuries occurred","excerpt":"the object was to inflict material damage on symbolic targets — and the publication of a book and a news sheet.Early last year Emile de Antonio, a documentary film maker who is himself a radical, though scarcely a violent one, managed to get in touch with the Weather Underground. Mr. de Antonio and two associates, Mary Lampson and Haskell Wexler, spent two days in a Los Angeles house with the five, talked with them and filmed the talk.The result is \\"Underground,\\" which opened yesterday at the Regency Theater. It suffers from the crippling difficulties under which it was made. It is a film in chains. It is a series of failures, but they are not stupid or careless ones. They are intelligent failures, and if Mr. de Antonio's effort is largely a defeat, it is a defeat that he conducts with skill and integrity.His intention was to have the five—Kathy Boudin, Bernardine Dohrn, Cathy Wilkerson, Billy Ayers and Jeff Jones—reveal something of themselves. His sympathetic question is: What is a white, middle - class revolutionary group doing in America in the mid-70's?The answers he gets, despite his efforts, are largely schematic and abstract. The five have schooled themselves to be impersonal. They seem to understand that for a film they must come out a bit, but they rarely manage to.There are a few breakthroughs. Kathy Boudin recalls her dismay in Havana in 1961 when she found herself—a peace marcher—applauding a parade of Cuban tanks. Bernardine Dohrn gives a curious insight into her long journey from a comfortable middle class to armed concealment: \\"I was more afraid growing up than I am now. Then it was paranoid; now it's real fear.\\"There is a hand wielding a coffee pot, and the red ribs of Bernardine Dohrn's sweater. They provide visual life, evidence that in fact we are seeing a film about five people. So do the faces of the three film makers; Mr. de Antonio's eye following that coffee pot has the impact of a cavalry charge.This is not intended to be facetious. The film makers have done marvelously well with these details, but the fact is, they have hardly anything else to film. The five will not allow their faces to be shown. So the camera shows their backs and their elbows.Talking faces, used by a film maker of Mr. de Antonio's skill and sensitivity, would have told us a lot about the five. But without the faces we have only the talk. It is good to have it—Weatherman played a small but significant part in the American radical movement, if only, paradoxically, to weaken it by violence—but the effect is claustrophobic.The film makers use clips of the war in Vietnam, peace marches and police charges to illustrate the talk and vary its pace. There is also a scene in which the five leave the house and interview people anonymously—we still don't see their faces—at an unemployment center. The unemployed are angry—what else would one expect? — and the five draw encouraging conclusions about an American revolution.This is naïve. It is frail. Weatherman got its name from the Bob Dylan line about not having to be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing. Now it has changed its name to Weather Underground. But how do you tell the wind's direction underground?The film doesn't ask this question, but, despite its sympathy, it doesn't try to conceal it either. That is its honesty.

But less significant objects can be almost as exciting, particularly when they pose interesting problems, says Harriet Irgang, a partner in New York Conservation Associates Ltd., which restores and repairs paintings.   Ms. Irgang recently worked on a landscape painted on oilcloth by a client's grandmother. It had been nailed to a wall, and the client wanted it cleaned, repaired and framed. \\"This was a challenge because it was so unusual,\\" said Ms. Irgang, a painting conservator since 1984.   A more common job is repairing enormous contemporary paintings torn and damaged in transit. \\"People who collect contemporary paintings rarely think about conservation problems, but big paintings need special care when they're moved,\\" Ms. Irgang said, standing over a huge, ripped canvas.    The six conservators at the 12-year-old Manhattan conservation studio clean paintings from Old Masters to the present. Discolored varnish can be removed. And structural work, which includes creating linings, stretchers and supports, can be accomplished on a variety of canvases.   Work can be done in phases, starting with efforts to prevent the painting from further disintegration. Cosmetic touches, like removing discolored varnish, can come later, Ms. Irgang said.

Daedalus has three conservators who work on sculpture dating from ancient to modern times, as well as archeological and decorative objects. The charge is $75 an hour.  Daria Keynan    (212) 206-6992      Very often artwork on paper becomes damaged simply because it was framed improperly, says Daria Keynan, a Manhattan-based paper conservator. Mats not made from 100 percent ragboard may contain acid, which destroys paper. And tape can leave stains and tears. \\"Half of the damage I see in works on paper from private collection is avoidable,\\" Ms. Keynan said.   Many paper problems can be solved.

In one case, the new film went directly to the source: of its five songs, four feature lyrics Dahl wrote for his 1964 children's classic (also called ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''). Danny Elfman, who wrote the score, said he ''wouldn't have dreamt'' of writing his own words: ''Dahl already had such great, rhythmic lyrics,'' he said. ''They were just waiting to be put to some form of melody.''    In the new film, the Oompa-Loompas -- who toil inside Mr. Wonka's factory making his confections -- perform elaborate production numbers, each explaining why one of Charlie's bratty companions has met an unpleasant fate. The gluttonous Augustus Goop gets a brassy Bollywood-style number","excerpt":"the obnoxious video-game freak (a conspicuous update), Mike Teavee, gets a theatrical, heavy-metal Queen parody. Dahl's words for Mike -- in 1964, an excoriation of television -- include: ''It clogs and clutters up the mind!/ It makes a child so dull and blind/ He can no longer understand/ A fantasy, a fairyland!'' Just as all of the Oompa-Loompas are played, with the help of computer graphics, by the diminutive actor Deep Roy, all of the voices are sung by Mr. Elfman, who overdubbed himself dozens of times.    For ''Willy Wonka,'' Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse wrote a single Oompa-Loompa theme with separate lyrics for each child, none of which used Dahl's macabre poetry. Of the six Broadway-style songs written for that film, only ''Wondrous Boat Ride,'' sung by Gene Wilder, was drawn largely from Dahl's prose. (Mr. Burton's 1996 ''James and the Giant Peach,'' also based on a Dahl book, featured songs by Randy Newman, only one of which used Dahl's words.) Though Hollywood has rarely turned to literary texts for lyrical inspiration, Mr. Elfman joins a lineage that includes the MGM composer Herbert Stothart, who set poetry by Elizabeth Barrett Browning for Norma Shearer to sing in ''The Barretts of Wimpole Street'' (1934); John Barry, who used Lewis Carroll's words for several songs in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' (1972); and more than a few people who have adapted Shakespeare, including John Williams for the ''Macbeth''-derived Hogwarts school song in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.''    ''We didn't want it to feel like a Broadway musical, where adult characters would begin singing their feelings,'' Mr. Elfman said, explaining the decision to go back to Dahl's words. ''We felt the only characters who should ever sing would be the Oompa-Loompas. They're this weird tribe; their world was very musical.''

Cable has a kinder, gentler sweeps gift: the ''MONK'' holiday special (USA, Friday, 9 p.m.), a typically shaggy and sentimental mystery that introduces Dan Hedaya as Monk's father. On PBS, where the sweeps ratings don't matter, the most interesting show of the week (not counting the much-talked-about-already finale of ''Prime Suspect'') may be one decidedly lacking in comfort and joy: the ''FRONTLINE'' installment ''A Hidden Life,'' which examines the sad, strange case of James West, the former Republican mayor of Spokane, Wash. (Tuesday night on most PBS stations; check local listings). No one comes off very well in this retelling, including the editors and reporters at the local newspaper who outed Mr. West in the process of printing accusations that he had abused young men. In outlining his personal and political implosion, the documentary, almost despite itself, ends up casting its protagonist as his own greatest victim.

Thus the first inroad made by the \\"talkies\\" in Great Britain will not be on the silent film but on the stage. The Piccadilly, thoroughly modern in construction and beautiful in green and gold, was built as a home for musical plays. One musical play was, in fact, shown there, but has since been transferred, and now this advance post of the speaking stage is surrendering to the talking film.Is this a sign of the times, a shadow cast before by coming events? Will the stage, already injured by the silent picture, be practically extinguished by its audible development? Last week I quoted the opinion of Basil Dean, one of the best and best-known English theatrical producers, that something of this sort might happen. Certainly the London stage has been in a bad way of late. Even importations from New York, which London managers seem on the whole to prefer to the native product, have been failing after runs that might be measured in weeks or even days. Talking pictures, should they intrigue and hold the public fancy, might well accelerate this rake's progress.And yet—there is nothing here yet of that whole-hearted belief in the future of all dialogue films that seems to prevail in Hollywood. Not even the talking film concerns themselves seem overly optimistic. This week, for instance, Stewart Sandeman, who besides being a member of Parliament is a director of British Phonofilms, the first talking film company in this country, predicted that for the next few years the real use of the sound film might be classified under the following four heads:\\"(1) News of the day.\\"(2) Effects","excerpt":"the occasional introduction of the human voice and the introduction of 'noises.'\\"(3) Turns, variety and revue sketches, or 'star' turns to offer interludes.\\"(4) Music. The incidental music will become part of film production instead of being left to the mercy of the local cinema orchestra. The perfect synchronization will make possible the production of ballets and excerpts from operas.\\"An English Opinion.So much for the talking film men themselves. One of England's foremost screen critics has gone further and asseverated that \\"America's remarkable stampede over talkies has practically made a present of the film producing industry to Britain. Hollywood, intent on stopping the rot in American cinema box offices, is voluntarily resigning its leadership of the film world, and Hollywood's difficulty is England's opportunity.\\" He advises British producers of the silent film to get together, hire or buy a Broadway theatre and thus sell their films to the thousands of American theatres which may never show talkies. There will be, he argues, a shortage throughout the world of non-talking films, and a demand that British producers can supply.I quote all this without comment, but it is interesting in view of the formation in New York by J. D. Williams of a company designed to give British and foreign silent films an entry into United States markets. John Maxwell, Chairman of British International, whose pictures will be placed in America through its agency, has cooperated in the forming of the new distributing concern. British International, already the largest producing firm in this country, has just completed a deal whereby it has secured control of First National-Pathé. This control was formerly held by the Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Ashfield, Sir William Jury and Will Evans combine. An important result of this transfer is that British International will from now on make the \\"quota pictures\\" required by First National here.Thus, the amalgamation and internationalization of English producing and distributing firms—now recognized as a necessary basis for real growth—goes on. British International, which has increased its capital to $5,000,000 to finance these activities, owns 95 per cent, of the share capital of the Sudfilm A. G., one of the two most important film distributing concerns in Germany. It also has a substantial holding in the Pathé Consortium Société Anonyme, the largest film distributing company in France; control of Sascha Films of Austria, which has subsidiary distributing companies in Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Rumania, and a substantial holding in Cinema-Art Films which will distribute British International products in Australia and New Zealand.British Productions.So much for organization. What of British International films themselves? Quantity production is at least assured since a fortnight ago the company screened No. 1 of five new British films to be shown to the trade in five successive weeks—a British record. Three of these have to date been seen by the critics. The first was \\"Champagne\\" and the second \\"Tesha.\\" \\"Champagne\\" was something of a disappointment, but \\"Tesha\\" was in many ways a highwater mark. \\"Champagne\\" had the advantage of being directed by Alfred Hichcock, one of the best of the English film makers, and its star was Miss Betty Balfour, decidedly England's best box office attraction. But the film lacks coherence. To pursue the metaphor its name suggests, it has sparkle but no body. It even has a cabaret scene which one thought had at last been outmoded. Its story tells how an American millionaire, to teach his giddy and jazzmad daughter a lesson, pretends to go broke. The daughter, making use of the only training circumstances have been allowed to give her, goes to work in a cabaret and there meets a young man who bears all the earmarks of smooth villainy. He rings true to appearances until the very moment when the heroine appears to have been enticed to her destruction. Then her father appears and explains that the whole thing was a joke.\\"Tesha\\" should be a certain box office asset. It has a \\"sexational\\" theme whose delicate situations have been handled with a deftness and yet a certain sincerity that make them censor-proof. It is beautifully acted by Maria Corda, the charming Austrian actress, and Jameson Thomas, who enhances his reputation as one of the finest actors on the British screen. Maria Corda appears as a Russian dancer whose love for her art is eclipsed by only one thing—her desire for motherhood. But when she gives up the stage for matrimony, her husband—his nerves ruined by shell shock—longs for but is denied fatherhood. The wife sacrifices her honor to give him what they both desire, only to discover that the father of the boy who is eventually born is her husband's best friend. Fate reveals the secret, but the husband, pardoning all because he loves so much and understands a little, stoops over the mother and the new-born child and kisses both.The third of the five films was that rare thing, a British comic picture; for the country which has produced Charlie Chaplin seems singularly chary of producing the kind of picture which Chaplin has made famous. \\"Adam's Apple\\" is not a Chaplin or Harold Lloyd success, but it is a very well presented slapstick comedy with a thril in it, and it had a highly successful trade showing. Monty Banks, an Italian recruit from variety—he was an acrobat in a \\"family\\" act—is a bridegroom who finds that he is to be chaperoned on his honeymoon by his mother-in-law. He meets other adventures which necessitate his rescuing his wife from kidnappers by swinging from one high building to another with a rope tied around a chimney.

They fall silent as Paul Zarzyski walks on stage. Zarzyski -- \\"rhymes with whisky,\\" he writes in one of his poems -- has brown eyes, a dark mustache and teeth that are slightly irregular. He hooks his thumbs in the pockets of his jeans, thrusts his hips forward and begins to recite \\"The Bucking Horse Moon\\":\\n\\nA kiss for luck, then we'd let 'er buck --\\n\\nI'd spur electric on adrenaline and lust.\\n\\nShe'd figure-8 those barrels\\n\\non her Crimson Missile sorrel\\n\\nwe'd make the night air swirl with hair and dust. \\n\\nWhen he finishes, people cheer and wave their hats. They have driven through snow and windstorms to attend the Cowboy Poetry Gathering, a yearly festival that takes place during the last week in January in Elko, Nev., an isolated town 250 miles east of Reno. This year, the gathering is expected to draw 10,000 people.\\n\\nFor four days and nights, no one seems to sleep. They troop from poetry readings to workshops and concerts and out to the bars, and then to an all-night party at a cattlemen's hotel. During the day, there are four poetry sessions running simultaneously, on themes like \\"Cowboy Love,\\" \\"Ranch Women\\" and \\"The Cowboy Code.\\" At night, all the performances are sold out, and every guest ranch and fleabag motel is booked a year in advance.\\n\\nAt a time when academic poetry finds its audience shrinking and its relevance in question, cowboy poetry is exploding, partly because it's accessible and light-hearted, but also because it celebrates a way of life that has a mythic hold on the national imagination. \\n\\nI don't believe, for example, that I would have traveled five hours to attend a festival of stockbroker poetry. But \\"cowboy poetry\\" -- the very words are seductive, suggesting the unlikely and irresistible marriage of the macho with the artistic.\\n\\nFrom the first day in Elko, I was charmed. While much of the poetry was simplistic and forgettable, I heard numerous poems that were witty and profound. But it was not the poetry alone that kept me in Elko for four days. I was caught up by the expansive spirit of the gathering, where ranchers come together to share their love of stories and words. I was given, for a brief time, immersion in a culture in which people still spend their day on horseback and feel, as a Montana poet, Wallace McRae, told me, \\"I live in the greatest place and do the greatest work you can do.\\"\\n\\nIN THE LOBBY OF THE ELKO CONVENTION CENTER, WADDIE Mitchell is autographing books for a long line of fans. He is the quintessential cowboy poet: tall and lanky, with lively blue eyes and a handlebar mustache. His laconic manner has endeared him to audiences on the \\"Tonight\\" show, at the Rainbow Room and the Library of Congress, where he has read such poems as \\"What Will I Tell Him?\\":\\n\\nWhat will I tell him, you ask me,\\n\\nWhen my son's trying to make up his mind?\\n\\nTo ride for a living like I have,\\n\\nOr explore what the world has to find?\\n\\nI'll tell him the truth as I know it --\\n\\nOf good years, hard winters and drought . . .\\n\\nThat adrenaline rush when you're bustin' up brush\\n\\nOn a cowpony, agile and stout \\n\\nMitchell first heard cowboy poetry growing up on a ranch near Jiggs, Nev. \\"Jiggs consists of a school that has 11 kids in it, a dance hall and a bar,\\" he says. \\"What more do you need?\\" When Mitchell was 14, he was allowed to start hanging out with cowboys in the bunkhouse. There was no electricity, no radio or television, so at night, they would tell stories and recite poems. \\"I suppose that's where the whole tradition of cowboy poetry began -- around the campfire at lonely outposts,\\" he says. \\"I found that if you tried to tell a story more than once, people would say, 'I've already heard that.' But if you set it to rhyme, people would listen again and again, the way they listen to a favorite song.\\"\\n\\nMitchell quit school at 17 to become a buckaroo.  His father sent him a set of Harvard Classics for Christmas, and \\"out of sheer boredom, I started reading them.\\" He also started writing poems. In 1985, a folklorist friend named Hal Cannon invited Mitchell to the first Poetry Gathering in Elko. The two men were setting out chairs for the first session when Mitchell said, \\"Who're we kidding? We'll never fill 100 chairs.\\" But more than 1,000 showed up.\\n\\nThat first year, only 6 of the 28 featured poets were women. There was simply no tradition of cowgirl poetry, says Teresa Jordan, who has edited a collection of ranch women's verse called \\"Graining the Mare.\\" \\"Women did not recite ballads to each other over coffee, or on the long rides to distant pastures,\\" she says. But in recent years, there has been a surge of poetry written by ranch women. At last year's festival, an all-female performance called \\"Real Women Buck Bales\\" was among the hottest tickets. The women's poems tend to be more raw and intimate, like Linda Hasselstrom's \\"Beef Eater\\" (in box at left).\\n\\nThe Elko Gathering has grown in every respect, sparking a renewal of passion for cowboy poetry, at a time when the number of actual cowboys continues to dwindle.\\n\\nIn 1994, there were more than 150 cowboy poetry festivals around the country, along with an outcrop of magazines, CD's and books featuring cowboy verse. Mitchell stopped working as a buckaroo to go on the poetry circuit full time","excerpt":"the odd twist, of course, is that the popularity of the work has removed him from the experience. As Zarzyski says, \\"You come to Elko to celebrate your way of life, but if somebody gives you the opportunity to dump it and make more money being a cowboy star, you take it.\\"\\n\\nZarzyski rode bareback broncs for 12 years, during which time he also studied poetry at the University of Montana. He resents it when critics label academic poetry as fine art and cowboy poetry as folk art.  \\"There's cowboy poetry that's folk art and there's cowboy poetry that's fine art,\\" he says, \\"and it's every damn bit as fine as the stuff published in The New Yorker.\\"\\n\\nLouis Simpson, who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1964, disagrees. \\"I'm sorry, but I have a high opinion of poetry, and anyone who can rhyme cat with mat is not a poet,\\" he says. \\"Ben Jonson said, 'A rhymer and a poet are two things,' and it's still true. Poetry is a spiritual thing, it has to appeal to the intellect, and it's an art. Guys who get on stage and belt out silly ideas that rhyme -- it's an entertainment, like flagpole sitting. But it's not poetry.\\"\\n\\nRobert Haas, who teaches American poetry at Berkeley, went to a cowboy poetry reading in Wyoming. \\"I was abashed and hugely amused,\\" he says. Haas compares the poems he heard to the popular newspaper poems of the 19th century. \\"I guess you could say that modernism took poetry away from ordinary people, and cowboy poetry is one way of taking it back.\\"\\n\\nZarzyski wonders why there must be a squaring-off between \\"the literati and the lariati.\\" If cowboy poetry is making people fall in love with the sound of words, he says, \\"the jump and kick of poetry lines, then we should all be tipping our hats to it, whether it's a cowboy hat or a fedora or whatever hat they wear in the far, far East. Because poetry is at the bottom of the barrel in this country. It's right down there with mime.\\"\\n\\nON THE LAST DAY OF THE FESTIVAL, THERE ARE 35 poetry readings, two concerts and, topping off the week, like icing on a cake, the Ian Tyson dance.\\n\\nIan Tyson was a well-known folk singer in the 1960's, half of the duo Ian and Sylvia. He eventually returned to western Canada, where he had grown up, to raise cutting horses and write cowboy music. Tyson is 61 now, striking, elegant and lean, with a remarkable voice -- honey-golden, laced with sadness. Backstage, I ask if he's seen a rising interest in cowboy music. \\"It's mostly me,\\" he says. \\"I'm the Charlie Parker of cowboy music.\\" His friends burst out laughing.\\n\\nAt 1 A.M., when the dance ends, everyone meets in an upstairs room at Stockmen's Motor Hotel, where cowboys drink, sing, play guitars, recite poetry and perform rope tricks. At 6 in the morning, a group of us head to the coffee shop for breakfast. Every seat is taken.\\n\\n\\"I'm torn,\\" says one young man at a crowded table. \\"I want to tell my friends back home about this, but I'm afraid everyone will come.\\"\\n\\n\\"It's too late,\\" answers Vess Quinlan, a poet from Colorado. \\"Everyone did come.\\" Git Along, Little Doggerel"},{"year":"1974","title":"As a novelist whose books tend to pivot on classic feminist issues, Gail Godwin will undoubtedly be shelved as yet another women's writer.

Yes, they called for  an unstinting effort to track down and punish the perpetrators, and that's essential. But an equally obvious response didn't seem to occur to them -- that the Western industrial democracies should also reduce their energy consumption and reliance on imported Middle East oil, which would be healthy for their economies, healthy for the environment, and make it so every bomb that goes off in Saudi Arabia doesn't become a world historical event.         The absence of such a recommendation from the Group of Seven economic summit  is all the more striking because the very reason the G-7 was founded was to deal with the economic fallout and currency disruptions set off by the 1973 oil shock.

Conducting is entirely a cumulative art, whose outstanding practitioners reveal their mastery over the long haul, not in virtuosic instants. An episode like Leonard Bernstein's famous overnight success with the New York Philharmonic is a glaring exception. Generally speaking, there are no conducting prodigies, and many talents rise to greatness only in old age. A night of good conducting is, after all, merely the average of a hundred musicians' efforts, and a great conducting career the average of many thousands of such nights.   So it is very difficult to draw conclusions from a single set of performances, as the distinguished jury of the American Symphony Orchestra's Stokowski Conducting Competition had to do at a finals concert on Friday night at Avery Fisher Hall. Yet it was not a futile exercise. One conductor did clearly stand out from two other finalists, although not enough for the jury to award a first prize. Jan Wagner, originally of Austria and now based in Minnesota, won second prize, and Steven Zike and Sebrina Alfonso shared third prize.

This film, which is the principal feature at the Capitol this week, has been fashioned with a heavy hand, with the obvious intention of sending audiences away with wet cheeks and damp handkerchiefs. Perhaps, because everybody loves a mother and babies, it will have a popular appeal. The narrative really deserved more adroit and cunning handling.As this story is unfurled one sees sequences which undoubtedly show flashes of inspiration. There is, for instance, a scene with a happy child splashing its milk on the face of another little chap, who does not appreciate this subtle idea of fun. He forthwith opens his mouth wide and yells his displeasure as the tears stream down his face. The contrast between the expressions on the faces of these two babies is most amusing.Mary Carr, who figured as the mother in William Fox's photoplay \\"Over the Hill,\\" is first seen in this current effort as Drusilla Doane, the inmate of an institution for the aged, and subsequently as the surprised and unsophisticated old lady who inherits a million dollars. In the initial chapters she is abused by the austere matron, because she is the only charity boarder.The matron is cruel and petty and takes pleasure in refusing even to permit Drusilla to enjoy an automobile ride when she gets the chance through the illness of one of the inmates.The matron and the other women are all smiles and kindness when they learn, to their utter dismay, that poor, pathetic Drusilla has inherited $1,000,000 from Elias Arnold, a distant relative, who died disgusted with the skylarking of his scapegrace son. Drusilla, who cannot understand the power of wealth, arrives at the palatial Arnold dwelling and amazes the retinue of servants by bowing to them and shaking their hands.One night a heartsick mother leaves her baby on Drusilla's marble doorstep, and, much against the wishes of the executor of the Arnold estate, Drusilla insists on caring for the child. Through publicity this kindness results in many other mothers emulating the example of the first woman. Eventually Drusilla is attacked by her neighbors, who declare that she is encouraging mothers to get rid of their babies.Young Arnold, following a stormy interview with his father, had married Sally May, the girl who nursed him after an automobile accident. A few months later Daphne Thornton, daughter of old Arnold's lawyer, discovers the whereabouts of Collin Arnold, and she tells his wife that Collin's chances of success are hampered by the bride. So this credulous young woman, without any further discussion of the matter with Collin, decides to run away from him.The director, F. Harmon Weight, hammers at the audience with his suspense. Sally May is working in a restaurant and the heart-broken husband enters the place to get a meal. His wife then is in the kitchen and because of some misadventure she is scolded and discharged.She walks through the aisle of chairs in the restaurant, but a man standing between her and Collin hides the two from each other's gaze. Later, in a court scene—after Sally May has been apprehended by the police for leaving her child on the Arnold doorstep—the instant Sally is called to the stand from an anteroom. Daphne, seeing her, pretends to faint, so as to make Collin leave the court. He does not see his wife, and Daphne keeps him outside as long as she can. This is rubbing in the suspense on the spectators.The cruelty of the \\"home\\" matron reminds one of the days of Dickens's \\"Oliver Twist,\\" except that it is pictured without sufficient reason or adequate characterization. The neighbors who so strnuously object to Drusilla's caring for babies are only movie characters not one betraying a flicker of a smile or a scintilla of maternal feeling.Mrs. Carr delivers, a sane, restrained and beautiful portrayal of Drusilla. It is a pity that the story was not produced with more plausibility, as Mrs. Carr is so sincere and sympathetic. The director has a peculiar conception of the license accorded a lawyer cross-examining a witness, and the proceedings as pictured would never be permitted in any court.Kenneth Harlan is acceptable as the regenerated Collin Arnold. Priscilla Bonner is excellent as the young mother, Mrs. Arnold. Her portrayal of the sorrow of a young mother is most convincing. There is one title in this picture which gives one to understand Sally had breathed her last, but as she is seen soon afterward one can dismiss the caption as an error.

You can, of course, revel at one of those hotel parties with noisemakers, paper hats and hefty tabs, but if you want to be different, the biggest New Year's Eve bash is outdoors &#8212;and free. It's the seventh annual New Year's Eve party in Central Park, at Bethesda Fountain and on the Mall near East 72d Street. The party starts at 10:30 P.M. with a parade, the accent being on the nineteen&#8208;thirties and forties, and continues with movies, dancing to a Latin band and fireworks at midnight. Balloons are free, and you can buy hot chocolate or coffee&#8212;but no wassail bowl. Making the scene at the Metropolitan Opera is something of a tradition on the last night of the old year, but, again, there's an alternative that would provide a nice change of pace. Try the Amato Opera, which at 319 Bowery is in a considerably less glamorous setting than the Met. The Amato is a tiny place that has been presenting opera at low prices for many years, with a piano and one or two other pieces making the music. The New Year's Eve program offers &#8220;La Boheme,&#8221; followed by a home&#8208;cooked buffet supper and, after midnight, much toasting and dancing, for $25 a couple. Reservations are necessary; call 228&#8208;8200. If you want to avoid the crowds, try the top of the Empire State Building (Fifth Avenue and 34th Street). The observation roof closes at 11:30, leaving you enough time to rush off somewhere to get caught up in the brash spirit of the occasion. Or take a Staten Island Ferry ride (round trip: 10 cents) on which you'll hear the ships moored in the harbor tooting away as 1974 is born.x What's Doing in New York City"},{"year":"1963","title":"Reston deplores dissipation of spirit that unified Amers after assassination, awakening them to personal responsibility for nation's ills and need for self-betternent Washington","excerpt":"The Old Year's Heritage to the New The Main Point The Sit-Ins"},{"year":"1936","title":"Article on old-fashioned parlor games GAMES FOR THE PARTY","excerpt":"The Old-Fashioned Brain Teaser Still Enjoys Wide Popularity"},{"year":"1928","title":"A mildly amusing comedy called \\"Don't Marry,\\" in which the young Lothario is either somewhat myopic or dreadfully credulous, is holding forth at the Roxy Theatre. It is nicely photographed, well acted, and there is also the opportunity to gaze frequently upon the wholesome beauty of Lois Moran, who, to carry out the scheme of things in this tale, is sometimes beheld wearing old-fashioned gowns and bathing suits. This feature may not be over-burdened with subtlety, but it at least possesses the virtue of not being tedious.Neil Hamilton fills the rôle of Henry Willoughby, a rather strange specimen, who is an out-and-out conservative in the matter of the conduct and costumes of the fair sex, but in delivering his harangue against this bobbed-hair and short-skirted era he employs 1928 slang. He refers to girls of the modern school as \\"smoke-eaters\\" and \\"gingarglers,\\" and so Louise Bowen, an up-to-the-minute girl, snaps her fingers in Willoughby's face and dubs him a \\"blue nose reformer.\\"The important question is how to make Henry appreciate the senselessness of his cramped notions. General Willoughby, Henry's uncle, offers the solution, which he whispers to Louise. He suggests that Louise bring to life a twin sister, dressed like a girl of the Victorian era. This young woman must be fond of knitting, revel in compositions like \\"Just a Song at Twilight,\\" and, if she must have an exciting evening, she is to play a rubber of whist.This jolly little girl is to be called Priscilla, and she, of course, is to be impersonated by Louise. When Priscilla appears upon the scene in long skirts and a big hat she is accompanied by her Aunt Abigail, the sort of woman who would be shocked at men whistling on the Sabbath. Henry is at first pleased by Priscilla and her modest manners and styles, but when this young lady objects to Henry's smoking cigarettes and goes in bathing in a weird-looking serge contraption, Henry is not so favorably impressed. The mischievous Louise as Priscilla makes life quite dull for Henry, and, as one might imagine, he begins to think that perhaps he made a mistake in his longing for the girls of the mauve decade.In one amusing scene Henry is perceived in swimming. Soon Priscilla, when Henry is far enough away, dives in, and when she comes up she is the neat-looking Louise. On the water is Priscilla's bathing costume, gradually disappearing from view. Louise had worn it over her modern boyish bathing suit and had taken it off under the water. This leaves Henry in a quandary, for subsequently he finds Louise but is worried concerning the whereabouts of Priscilla.Mr. Hamilton gives a fair-enough portrayal of Henry and Miss Moran is delightful as both the modern and the old-fashioned girl. Claire McDowell is capital as Aunt Abigail.Among the interesting Movietone features is one of Ambassador Herrick speaking at the presentation of the Nungesser-Coli memorial, erected at Le Bourget Flying Field, near Paris, on the spot where Lindbergh landed after his triumphant transatlantic flight.Mr. Rothafel's stage contributions include \\"Dance of the Hours,\\" from \\"La Gioconda,\\" and a charming \\"Hawaiian Episode.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Old-Fashioned Impostor."},{"year":"1952","title":"THE Lady apple, used extensively in making up gift packages of fruit, combines a romantic history with modern problems of apple growing and merchandising.

This gesture is answered by gently agitated stirrings in an orchestra freely peppered with percussion instruments.

We decided to add 'A Wedding Album' to complete the package. By adding the photographs we were better able to explore some of the traditions and diversity of the wedding celebration.\\" \\n\\nThe exhibition, spread through three galleries, is arranged chronologically to show the evolution of wedding gowns and make it easy to spot style trends. Gowns worn by mannequins are paraded in groups on elevated platforms in the Red Gallery. \\n\\nTraveling from the Civil War to the present brings home the fact that white was not the traditional color of wedding dresses. \\"White really took off when Queen Victoria married in 1840 and wore white,\\" Ms. Donnelly said. But three dark wedding dresses are shown in the exhibition. Women often wore their best dress, which could be dark and suitable for other occasions as well. Another reason was being in mourning for a loved one. \\"Mourning was very prescribed,\\" Ms. Donnelly said.\\n\\n\\"You had different stages. For a close relative it lasted two years and you wore varying dark colors starting with black, then brown, followed by purple.\\"\\n\\nAnother reason was preference, individual or dictated by fashion. \\"Just prior to the Civil War,\\" Ms. Donnelly said, \\"plaids were extremely popular. Wearing a plaid dress was a sign of affluence because the hoop required a lot of material and matching the plaid took extra fabric. In 1886 blues and browns were popular and Godey's Lady's Book conveyed that to potential brides as the colors of choice for the season. Then there was a period in the 1930's when black dresses were popular. And today vibrant colors are shown as an alternative to the white standard.\\" \\n\\nThough the white wedding gowns on display have taken on a patina with time, they probably were not white but varying shades of cream, which are much more becoming to most women.\\n\\nThe white wedding dress, which is considered to be traditional today, first appeared in the 1820's, though it did not then negate wearing other colors. For those choosing white, bridal literature provided guidelines. In 1894 the Ladies Home Journal advised: \\"When wearing a white gown thought must be given to the becomingness of the shade, for, after all, there are as many tints in white as in other colors","excerpt":"the one that may suit the pale blonde is absolutely unbecoming to the rosy brunette. \\n\\n\\"Dead white, which has a glint of blue about it, is seldom becoming to anyone. It brings out the imperfections of the complexion, tends to deaden the gloss of the hair and dulls the brightness of the eyes. The white that touches on the cream or coffee shade is undoubtedly the most artistic and best suited to the general woman.\\"\\n\\nA stroll through the show reveals gowns were long until the mid-1930's. \\"Wedding dresses reflected day-dress style,\\" Ms. Donnelly said. \\"In the period when women wore hoops to do their marketing, they also used them for their wedding dresses. So if you wore a long day dress, you also wore a long wedding dress. In the 20's during the flapper style, dresses came up to just below the knee. In the mid-30's they started to go long again and remain that way to this day. But since the 1930's wedding dresses no longer represent day-dress style.\\"\\n\\nThe first and oldest gown displayed, circa 1859, a cream silk satin and faille, has a billowing skirt layered with petticoats to give the effect of the hoop skirt. Petticoats were heavy and hoops eventually gave women more freedom.\\n\\nA dark brown and black bustle dress, circa 1880, probably represents a best dress, or a time of mourning. A blue-gray speckled with white reflects the big puffy leg-of-mutton sleeves of the 1890's. One standout, with a highly detailed, shirred and flounced white net and lace bodice, was worn by Grace Carol Ferguson in 1898. \\n\\nWomen were heavily corseted to achieve thin waists. \\"Some went to the extreme of having lower ribs removed,\\" Ms. Donnelly said. \\"They carried smelling salts because they were so tightly corseted they had trouble breathing.\\" \\n\\nAnother focal point is the Trousseau Room, which represents a bride's bedroom, circa 1906. A wedding dress hangs on a mannequin, a going-away outfit is draped over a sleigh bed, and camisoles, corset covers, drawers and other undergarments, ready to be packed, cascade from dresser drawers. \\n\\n\\"A Wedding Album\\" creates a grand finale in its own gallery bedecked with 94 photographs dating from 1860 to the present, covering several generations and historical eras. \\n\\n\\"We solicited wedding photos from the community,\\" Ms. Donnelly said. \\"Ninety percent are on loan, the other 10 percent from the museum's collection. The prerequisites for inclusion were that the wedding took place here in Stamford or, recognizing that Stamford is a transient community, that the couple spent a portion of their life here.\\"\\n\\nSeveral generations of the same family are represented along with changing styles and fashions. Early wedding photography tended to be formal. \\"In the beginning, they were nonsmiling pictures because of the technology,\\" Ms. Donnelly said. \\"The exposure could be a minute or longer and people had to remain still. Also, when photography first came in, it mimicked portraiture, which was formal. It was not until the 1930's that people started smiling, and the 1960's that photographs were consistently colored.\\"\\n\\n\\"Although weddings vary in the way they are celebrated -- formal or informal, with different cultural traditions,\\" Ms. Donnelly said, \\"they all share a common bond representing an important rite of passage.\\" \\n\\n\\nThe Stamford Historical Society, 1508 High Ridge Road, is open Tuesday through Sunday, noon to 4 P.M.

Here is a primer on the benefits and disadvantages:    Q. What is hydrogen, and where does it come from?    A. It is the lightest gas and the simplest, most abundant element in the universe. Because it is present in so many compounds, including water, supplies cannot be exhausted. But hydrogen is not actually a fuel, and can be used in a vehicle only after it is separated from other elements. This process itself consumes energy.    Q. How is hydrogen used to power a car? And what's a fuel cell?    A. A fuel cell uses a chemical process, similar to that in a battery, to produce electricity -- in this case, from hydrogen that flows into the cell from a storage tank. This electricity drives the fuel-cell car's electric motor","excerpt":"the only byproducts are heat and water.    Q. What are the potential advantages?    A. Because hydrogen is found everywhere, supplies are not only infinite, they pose no geographic challenges. It can be produced, albeit expensively, from emission-free sources like solar panels, wind turbines or even nuclear plants. Fuel cells can be easily scaled up or down in size, so they could replace small computer batteries or large power plants. A hydrogen car emits no pollution or global warming gases, aside from what might have resulted from producing the hydrogen itself.    Q. If it's so great, why aren't we driving hydrogen cars right now?    A. Widespread use of fuel-cell cars will have to wait until the cells become cheaper and more efficient, and until storage methods have evolved to give vehicles a travel range of perhaps 300 miles. Hydrogen production will have to be scaled up and standardized, and pumping stations equipped for hydrogen refueling at an affordable price.    Q. I've heard about the Hindenburg -- is hydrogen safe?    A. Hydrogen is very flammable, and poses special challenges: it burns without a visible flame, for instance. But it is arguably no more dangerous than gasoline, and fuel-cell cars are built with leak detectors and very strong crash-resistant tanks. As for the Hindenburg tragedy of 1937, a retired NASA engineer, Addison Bain, theorizes that the dirigible burned not because it contained hydrogen, but because its cloth skin was coated with highly flammable paint. Others disagree with his assessment.    Q. How will a car carry hydrogen?    A. Hydrogen can be stored as a gas, as a liquid or in metal hydrides, which are chemical sponges, but each form has advantages and disadvantages. Still, much of automakers' current research focuses on pressurized hydrogen gas.    Q. When will I have a hydrogen car in my driveway?    A. Joseph Romm, a former Department of Energy official and author of ''The Hype About Hydrogen'' (Island Press, 2004), says, ''I doubt that in the next 20 years an affordable, durable and efficient vehicle will be delivered that will be attractive to the public.'' But a renewable energy advocate, Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute, says the nation's car fleet could be converted to hydrogen in less than a decade, and a network of small hydrogen reformers (devices that produce hydrogen from natural gas or other sources) could be quickly installed in 10 to 20 percent of the nation's 180,000 gas stations for $2 billion to $4 billion.    Q. Is this just a lot of hype?    A. Some overblown claims have already been disproved. But there is also groundbreaking research backed by serious testing programs. Lawrence D. Burns, General Motors' vice president for research and planning, says G.M. aims to have a production-ready fuel-cell vehicle (built on an innovative ''skateboard'' platform that could support a variety of bodies) by 2010. DaimlerChrysler is running 30 fuel-cell buses in Europe and helping to seed a hydrogen infrastructure in Iceland.     Fuel-cell Toyota Highlanders are being tested at two California universities; both the City of Los Angeles and the State of New York are using Honda FCX's. Nissan will reportedly lease a few X-Trail fuel-cell S.U.V.'s to American businesses in 2007.    Q. Will fuel-cell cars be cheap to operate? Where will I fill up?    A. Hydrogen's current price is three to four times that of gasoline. The Department of Energy has issued optimistic cost estimates, but they assume widespread commercial acceptance of hydrogen fuel -- which is at least a decade away. There are only a few hydrogen stations scattered around the country, though California envisions a 170-station ''hydrogen highway'' by 2010; Florida has announced a similar plan.    Q. How long will fuel cells last?    A. The journal of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers says the life of fuel cells may be only a fifth as long as that of a typical gasoline engine -- about 30,000 miles versus 150,000. Ben Knight, vice president for automotive engineering at Honda, agrees that the durability of fuel-cell stacks is ''a work in progress,'' but promises ''a significantly longer life'' from newer designs.    Q. Can you run a regular engine with hydrogen, without fuel cells?    A. Yes. A hydrogen Cadillac was featured at President Jimmy Carter's inauguration in 1977. A Mini with a hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine was displayed at the Frankfurt auto show in 2001, and Ford has shown prototypes. BMW plans to offer a ''dual fuel'' 7 Series sedan, which could run on either gasoline or hydrogen, by 2008. That V-12 car would have a range of 125 miles on hydrogen and 185 on gasoline.

You might think that a clique of privileged, navel-gazing 40-somethings who reunite for a wedding and spend the weekend at an inn drinking cabernet sauvignon and rehashing prep school days would come off as a tad self-involved. And hey, you'd be right. Happily, Shreve's knack for engrossing storytelling mostly makes up for the bourgeois malaise. This post-9/11 novel (the characters think and talk repeatedly about the World Trade Center) explores missed opportunities and second chances. Six of the seven main characters are in, or have been in, relationships that range from deeply dysfunctional to just plain depressing","excerpt":"the only character who seems at all happy is gay. Prep school will traumatize anybody, but this group was especially scarred by the death of a golden-boy classmate just before graduation. The incident is referred to obliquely -- ''the scene at the cottage,'' ''that night,'' ''the night of the party'' -- and Shreve wrings a pleasurable amount of suspense from the setup before the inevitable reveal. There's also a story within the story, a risky narrative maneuver, right up there with the long expository letter (Shreve includes a couple of those too, the daredevil), but she pulls it off, and the tale of historical disaster one of her characters is writing is a page turner. Regrettably, back at the inn, it's only when the characters stop thinking and start interacting that the main narrative finds a similar urgency.

When Maria Jeritza swept onstage - a tall, imperious, yet irresistibly feminine woman with a ravishing figure, exquisite face and shimmering blond hair - audiences knew they were in the presence of a star. And one of the things that made Miss Jeritza a prima donna was that she knew it, too.   Miss Jeritza was one of the great artists of opera's ''golden age,'' or at least the latter part of it, from 1910 to 1930.

All went well for the first five days. However, the morning that I was to return the car to the airport, the vehicle failed to start. I called Europcar at the Reggio airport. No one answered so I called the number listed on my contract, Europcar's central office in Milan. They assured me that a car would be sent to me immediately so I could get to the airport. One-half hour later a service truck appeared with two men to take the car to a nearby town for repairs, but they had no knowledge of a replacement car. At this point there was no way to make it to the airport in time for my flight, since I was in a town that was two hours from Reggio.   For the next six hours I struggled to get a reservation on a flight back to New York. All flights, on all carriers, were sold out for the week. Not until I had made several phone calls to Rome as well as New York and contacted friends at Alitalia was I able to confirm a flight home.   The result was a few hundred dollars in phone calls, a $140 one-day rental charge for a car that would not start and an enormous amount of aggravation. DOMINICK ASPREA Brooklyn Enza Liberatore, customer relations manager, Europcar Italia, replies: We authorized Europassistance to tow Mr. Asprea's car to our office at Reggio Calabria airport (presumably with him going along). At 8:40 A.M. he called back because the tow truck had not arrived and he had to catch a plane at 10 A.M. The tow truck came from Locri (about 12 miles away) and arrived about 9 A.M. Our agent at the airport later recognized the client and asked the whereabouts of our car. Mr. Asprea mentioned the breakdown and added that he had missed the plane. When the car was delivered to the airport, our agent immediately started the car. It had no mechanical fault","excerpt":"the only problem our agent could find was that the car was in third gear and that, having an automatic transmission, it could start only in parking position -- which Mr. Asprea apparently overlooked in his rush to get to the airport.

It is by no means certain that the Justices will use the case as a vehicle for overruling Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. That step is among several options available to the Court, whose support for Roe v. Wade was already paper thin even before President Bush's two Supreme Court appointees replaced two of the Court's strongest supporters of abortion rights. One More Worry for Bush     Leaders of abortion rights groups had sought an early ruling from the Court in the belief that the case could prove a political liability for Mr. Bush. The prospect of a decision this term does provide one more worrisome variable for the President's re-election campaign.  [ News analysis, page A17. ]   \\"The Court has helped us today by intensifying the threat and making the issue real for people,\\" said Kate Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights Action League. \\"There's no question that abortion will be a major issue in the election.\\"   Several Republican strategists agreed privately today that the case handed the Bush Administration a political problem. One said a Supreme Court ruling cutting back on the right to abortion would insure a divisive fight at the Republican National Convention over the party platform, which now has a strong anti-abortion plank. 19th Anniversary of Ruling    Publicly, Republican advisers sought to minimize the impact of the case. Abortion \\"is never going to be a decisive issue in a Presidential campaign,\\" said Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign.   The Court's action came on the eve of the 19th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, and events outside the Court underscored the ferocity of the emotions the decision still engenders. More than 350 anti-abortion protesters were arrested in Washington today for trying to block patients' access to two downtown abortion clinics. On Wednesday, the actual anniversary, abortion opponents will hold their annual march, and advocates of the right to choose abortion will hold a rally.   The Pennsylvania case presents a constitutional challenge to a state law that, while not prohibiting abortion, seeks to limit access to the procedure through a variety of regulations. These include a 24-hour waiting period and a requirement that married women notify their husbands if they are planning to have an abortion.   The Court is likely to uphold some or all of the regulations, several of which are nearly identical to those the Court has struck down in other cases in the last decade. The result of such a ruling would be to leave Roe v. Wade substantially weakened, and would give states increased latitude to regulate abortions in ways that make the procedure difficult to obtain for women lacking in financial or emotional resources.    But the decision, which is expected by late June or early July, will not necessarily indicate how the Court would rule on a law that makes abortion a crime. Legal challenges to abortion prohibitions recently enacted in Louisiana, Utah and the territory of Guam are now in the lower Federal courts, and will probably reach the Supreme Court within the next year.   Because the Pennsylvania case appeared likely to reach the Supreme Court first, it has been closely monitored by all sides in the abortion debate. The state regulations, adopted in 1988 and 1989, were challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America on behalf of several abortion clinics in the state.   Federal District Judge Daniel H. Huyett 3d, who was named to the bench by President Richard M. Nixon in 1970, declared the regulations unconstitutional in a 1990 opinion that was largely overturned last Oct. 21 by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia.    The appellate court upheld most of the regulations, including an \\"informed consent\\" provision that requires doctors to wait 24 hours before performing abortions on women, to whom they must first provide information intended to discourage them from going through with the procedure.   Although the Supreme Court has twice struck down a similar regulation, the appellate court interpreted more recent High Court rulings, specifically the 1989 decision in a Missouri case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, as a substantial retreat from the searching scrutiny to which the Court had previously subjected all abortion regulations. In the Webster case, the Court upheld state regulations that included a ban on abortions in public hospitals.   But the appellate court struck down a provision of the Pennsylvania law requiring married women to notify their husbands of their decision to get an abortion. Under the law, women who falsely certify that they have provided the required notice face a penalty of up to a year in jail. The appeals court ruled that this provision was the type of \\"undue burden\\" on the right to abortion that the Webster decision indicated the Supreme Court would find unacceptable.   Even if the Third Circuit's interpretation of the Webster decision was correct, that decision may no longer reflect the Supreme Court's view.   The Webster ruling was a split decision in which four Justices -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy -- indicated they were prepared to overturn Roe v. Wade. Four others -- Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens and Harry A. Blackmun -- indicated their strong continued support for Roe v. Wade.    In the middle was Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who put forward her own analysis calling for abortion regulations to be scrutinized on a kind of sliding scale, depending on the degree of burden they placed on access to abortion. Only those regulations creating an \\"undue burden\\" would be subject to the strictest constitutional scrutiny, requiring the state to justify them by demonstrating a \\"compelling state interest.\\"  New Faces on the Court    In its decision last October the Third Circuit declared that Justice O'Connor's analysis was \\"the law of the land.\\" Since the Webster decision, however, Justices Brennan and Marshall have retired and the balance may well have shifted. Neither of their replacements, Justices David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas, has yet voted in an abortion case. The vote of either could determine the outcome in this case.   Both sides in the case sought a quick Supreme Court review of the Third Circuit's decision. There was little doubt that the Court would agree to hear the case","excerpt":"the only question was whether they would do so on a schedule that permitted a decision before the Presidential election next November.   That result is highly likely. The case will be argued in April. Only in the event that the Court reaches a deadlock and needs to hear further argument next fall would the Justices not decide the case by the time the current term ends in late June or early July.   Lawyers for the abortion rights groups who appealed the Pennsylvania case to the Supreme Court have sought to use the case as ammunition in a wider political war. Expecting to lose in the Court in any event, the abortion rights groups want to use a defeat to mobilize public support for passage of Federal legislation that would guarantee the right to abortion and prohibit the states from imposing restrictions. Hundreds Cross Police Lines    The Supreme Court's announcement that it would hear the Pennsylvania case came as hundreds of chanting, hymn-singing anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested after crossing police barriers that cordoned off the entrances to the Washington Surgi-Clinic and the nearby Capitol Women's Center in downtown Washington.   At each clinic, hundreds of abortion rights advocates linked arms in a counterprotest, forming a human chain to prevent anti-abortion demonstrators from approaching the building.   Randall A. Terry, who led the Operation Rescue blockades in Wichita, Kan., last summer, said in a telephone interview that he was pleased with today's results. \\"We were able to close down the abortion facilities for several hours,\\" he said, \\"and hopefully, we saved some childrens' lives.\\"   Leaders of the Washington Area Clinic Defense Task Force, which organized the counterprotest, also declared their actions successful. \\"As far as I know, no patients were turned away,\\" said Gina Roccanova, a spokeswoman for the the group.

They have a bowl of porridge, and then they. . . .\\" Tikon gives an abrupt, nasty Bronx cheer that, in Mr. Brooks's elastic vocabulary, may be either an insult or a euphemism—for death and lesser failures.\\"The Twelve Chairs,\\" which opened yesterday at the Loew's Tower East Theater, is otherwise a comedy for Brooks-watchers somewhat more indulgent than I. The screenplay is an adaptation of the Soviet comic novel by Ilf and Petrov, who continued the adventures of Ostap Bender in a second novel, \\"The Little Golden Calf.\\"The film is essentially one long chase across the Soviet Union, to Moscow, Siberia and the Crimea, undertaken by three energetic, irritable and inept treasure hunters—Ostap Bender, the youngest of the trio, Vorobyaninov (Ron Moody), a fallen aristocrat, and Father Fyodor (Dom DeLuise), a fallen priest. Their prize is a dining room chair, one of a set of 12, in which Vorobyaninov's unpleasant mother-in-law hid 50,000 rubles worth of jewels during the Revolution.As able as the three leading actors are, it is Mr. Brooks, who, though he appears only briefly in the film, dominates it from the beginning, which is a death scene, to the end, in which the movie, quite literally, winds up flat on its back, jerking with the spasms of a simulated epileptic fit.Most of the things that happen in between are almost as joyless, and as joyless as the Soviet Union the film purposefully depicts. This is, I think, because Mr. Brooks's sense of humor is expressed almost entirely in varying degrees of rudeness and cruelty, unrelieved by any comic vision of mankind, of the Soviet Union, or even of his characters.There is an innocence about \\"The Twelve Chairs,\\" but it is the kind of innocence in which one character will say to another \\"You aren't worth spitting on.\\" To which the second replies: \\"Well you are!\\" and then spits on the first. For some reason, this sort of comedy of physical insult seemed much funnier to me in the Broadway world of \\"The Producers,\\" which really is aggressive and nasty and cheap, than in a Russia that is not too far removed from the world of Sholem Aleichem.In \\"The Twelve Chairs\\" Mr. Brooks wants to be lovable, and to stomp on your foot at the same time.

This entrancing production was directed by Frank Borsage, who guided the destinies of the pictorial version of \\"Seventh Heaven.\\" In it the leading rôles are finely portrayed by Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell. Never has the camera been used quite so effectively and artistically as it is in this subject, for in the background of the sombre side of Naples there are the compelling shadows, the inspiring old arches, the slender iron railings over the foot-worn steps and, in many of the scenes, there hangs a soft mist through which the characters sometimes fade gradually from view.The excellence of this feature does not depend on trick photography, but upon genuinely expert composition of the scenes and careful atmospheric effects. The scenes actually bring to mind Naples at night and as the camera slides from side to side one seems to have been through an extensive section of the dismal quarter of the old town. There is, however, relief from this sordid district, when the producer depicts a small caravan circus, with its strong man, the girl in tights whom he can hold arm-high and the young artist who discovers inspiration in the dainty creature. In the first episode this girl, to save her mother's life, is willing to sacrifice her purity. Her arrest and unjust conviction follow, but before the police succeed in taking her to the workhouse, she escapes.Gino, the artist, knows nothing of this leaf from Angela's life. Angela's mother died and as time goes on she revels in the love for Gino, who paints her picture so that she looks like a Madonna.The story is admirably worked out with splendid suspense. There is the episode wherein Gino disposes of his painting to an old swindler, who decides to change the painting so that he can pass it off as an old master. Gino, a jolly fellow, forgets in his pleasure at having sold his painting that he and Angela need food. Subsequently he is asked to do the mural decorations of a church, and with the money he receives in advance he returns to the abode (where he and Angela have separate lodgings) armed with a basket packed with fruit, food and wine. In the meantime one of the policemen who arrested Angela remembers where he saw her. Follows then an hour, granted by the minion of the law, which Angela is permitted to spend with Gino before going to prison.The story is told in a peculiarly appealing fashion. It is particularly charming when Gino whistles a few bars from \\"O Sole Mio\\" and hears the answer whistled by Angela. When she is led away to the workhouse, Gino is in his room. He whistles and at first Angela cannot make a sound with her nervous lips, but finally she succeeds in spasmodically whistling the air. All these scenes are so marvelously photographed, that even without considering the story or the acting, they are always a source of admiration. It is indeed a picture which possibly more than any other reveals the strides made in motion picture camera work.Miss Gaynor and Mr. Farrell, who were together in the film conception of \\"Seventh Heaven,\\" are equally clever in this current offering. Miss Gaynor is especially fine in the sequence in which she is having the tearful hour with Gino, who looks upon her tears of sorrow as tears of joy. Mr. Farrell is a fine specimen of manhoood, and he, too, acts as well as he did as that \\"very remarkable fellow\\" in \\"Seventh Heaven.\\" He is swelled with pride as the artist who has earned an enviable commission and when he is left alone he is doleful, morose, wondering what has become of Angela.Mr. Borsage, who evidently knows his Naples, has done everything humanly possible to reflect the atmosphere of that blue-skied city, even to having the police going on their rounds in two and in the selection of his types.Some exceptionally interesting movietone features preface this subject. Among them are the first telephonic communication with Paris","excerpt":"the opening of the new Lloyds home, in London, by the King and Queen; Robert Benchley's amusing sketch, \\"The Treasurer's Report,\\" and a rehearsal of the Moulin Rouge in Paris.

Hialeah that a city's prohibition of ritual animal sacrifice violated the constitutional right to free exercise of religion. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, which was joined in full by Justice John Paul Stevens and in most respects by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Byron R. White. Justice David H. Souter wrote a separate opinion, as did Justice Harry A. Blackmun, whose opinion was joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. BY JUSTICE KENNEDY, For the Court    The principle that government may not enact laws that suppress religious belief or practice is so well understood that few violations are recorded in our opinions. Concerned that this fundamental nonpersecution principle of the First Amendment was implicated here, however, we granted certiorari.    Our review confirms that the laws in question were enacted by officials who did not understand, failed to perceive, or chose to ignore the fact that their official actions violated the nation's essential commitment to religious freedom. The challenged laws had an impermissible object, and in all events the principle of general applicability was violated because the secular ends asserted in defense of the laws were pursued only with respect to conduct motivated by religious beliefs. We invalidate the challenged enactments and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.   This case involves practices of the Santeria religion, which originated in the 19th century. When hundreds of thousands of members of the Yoruba people were brought as slaves from eastern Africa to Cuba, their traditional African religion absorbed significant elements of Roman Catholicism. The resulting syncretion, or fusion, is Santeria, \\"the way of the saints.\\" The Cuban Yoruba express their devotion to spirits, called orishas, through the iconography of Catholic saints. Catholic symbols are often present at Santeria rites, and Santeria devotees attend the Catholic sacraments.    The Santeria faith teaches that every individual has a destiny from God, a destiny fulfilled with the aid and energy of the orishas. The basis of the Santeria religion is the nurture of a personal relation with the orishas, and one of the principal forms of devotion is an animal sacrifice. The sacrifice of animals as part of religious rituals has ancient roots.                    . . .         According to Santeria teaching, the orishas are powerful but not immortal. They depend for survival on the sacrifice. Sacrifices are performed at birth, marriage and death rites, for the cure of the sick, for the initiation of new members and priests, and during an annual celebration. Animals sacrificed in Santeria rituals include chickens, pigeons, doves, ducks, guinea pigs, goats, sheep and turtles. The animals are killed by the cutting of the carotid arteries in the neck. The sacrificed animal is cooked and eaten, except after healing and death rituals.                    . . .         The religion was brought to this nation most often by exiles from the Cuban revolution. The District Court estimated that there are at least 50,000 practitioners in South Florida today.    Petitioner Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye Inc. (Church), is a not-for-profit corporation organized under Florida law in 1973. The Church and its congregants practice the Santeria religion. . . . In April 1987, the Church leased land in the city of Hialeah, Fla., and announced plans to establish a house of worship as well as a school, cultural center, and museum. . . .   The prospect of a Santeria church in their midst was distressing to many members of the Hialeah community.                    . . .         In September 1987, the City Council adopted three substantive ordinances addressing the issue of religious animal sacrifice. Ordinance 87-52 defined \\"sacrifice\\" as \\"to unnecessarily kill, torment, torture or mutilate an animal in a public or private ritual or ceremony not for the primary purpose of food consumption,\\" and prohibited owning or possessing an animal \\"intending to use such animal for food purposes.\\"                     . . .         The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which has been applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .\\" The city does not argue that Santeria is not a \\"religion\\" within the meaning of the First Amendment. Nor could it. Although the practice of animal sacrifice may seem abhorrent to some, \\"religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection.\\" Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div. (1981). Given the historical association between animal sacrifice and religious worship, petitioners' assertion that animal sacrifice is an integral part of their religion \\"cannot be deemed bizarre or incredible.\\" Frazee v. Illinois Dept. of Employment Security (1989). Neither the city nor the courts below, moreover, have questioned the sincerity of petitioners' professed desire to conduct animal sacrifices for religious reasons. We must consider petitioners' First Amendment claim.   In addressing the constitutional protection for free exercise of religion, our cases establish the general proposition that a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice. Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith (1990).                    . . .         Although a law targeting religious beliefs as such is never permissible, if the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation, the law is not neutral (see Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith) and it is invalid unless it is justified by a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to advance that interest. There are, of course, many ways of demonstrating that the object or purpose of a law is the suppression of religion or religious conduct. To determine the object of a law, we must begin with its text, for the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face. A law lacks facial neutrality if it refers to a religious practice without a secular meaning discernable from the language or context. Petitioners contend that three of the ordinances fail this test of facial neutrality because they use the words \\"sacrifice\\" and \\"ritual,\\" words with strong religious connotations. We agree that these words are consistent with the claim of facial discrimination, but the argument is not conclusive. The words \\"sacrifice\\" and \\"ritual\\" have a religious origin, but current use admits also of secular meanings. The ordinances, furthermore, define \\"sacrifice\\" in secular terms, without referring to religious practices.                    . . .         The record in this case compels the conclusion that suppression of the central element of the Santeria worship service was the object of the ordinances. . . . No one suggests, and on this record it cannot be maintained, that city officials had in mind a religion other than Santeria.   It becomes evident that these ordinances target Santeria sacrifice when the ordinances' operation is considered. Apart from the text, the effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence of its object. To be sure, adverse impact will not always lead to a finding of impermissible targeting. For example, a social harm may have been a legitimate concern of government for reasons quite apart from discrimination. The subject at hand does implicate, of course, multiple concerns unrelated to religious animosity, for example, the suffering or mistreatment visited upon the sacrificed animals and health hazards from improper disposal. But the ordinances when considered together disclose an object remote from these legitimate concerns. The design of these laws accomplishes instead a \\"religious gerrymander,\\" Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, an impermissible attempt to target petitioners and their religious practices.                    . . .         In sum, the neutrality inquiry leads to one conclusion: The ordinances had as their object the suppression of religion. The pattern we have recited discloses animosity to Santeria adherents and their religious practices","excerpt":"the ordinances by their own terms target this religious exercise; the texts of the ordinances were gerrymandered with care to proscribe religious killings of animals but to exclude almost all secular killings, and the ordinances suppress much more religious conduct than is necessary in order to achieve the legitimate ends asserted in their defense. These ordinances are not neutral, and the court below committed clear error in failing to reach this conclusion.   We turn next to a second requirement of the Free Exercise Clause, the rule that laws burdening religious practice must be of general applicability. Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U. S., at 879-881. All laws are selective to some extent, but categories of selection are of paramount concern when a law has the incidental effect of burdening religious practice. . . .   The principle that government, in pursuit of legitimate interests, cannot in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief is essential to the protection of the rights guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause. . . . In this case we need not define with precision the standard used to evaluate whether a prohibition is of general application, for these ordinances fall well below the minimum standard necessary to protect First Amendment rights.                    . . .         We conclude, in sum, that each of Hialeah's ordinances pursues the city's governmental interests only against conduct motivated by religious belief. The ordinances \\"ha(ve) every appearance of a prohibition that society is prepared to impose upon  [ Santeria worshippers ]  but not upon itself.\\" The Florida Star v. B. J. F. (1989). This precise evil is what the requirement of general applicability is designed to prevent.   A law burdening religious practice that is not neutral or not of general application must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny. To satisfy the commands of the First Amendment, a law restrictive of religious practice must advance \\"interests of the highest order\\" and must be narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests. . . . A law that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment or advances legitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a religious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare cases. It follows from what we have already said that these ordinances cannot withstand this scrutiny.                    . . .        BY JUSTICE SOUTER, Concurring   This case turns on a principle about which there is no disagreement, that the Free Exercise Clause bars government action aimed at suppressing religious belief or practice. The Court holds that Hialeah's animal-sacrifice laws violate that principle, and I concur in that holding without reservation.   Because prohibiting religious exercise is the object of the laws at hand, this case does not present the more difficult issue addressed in our last free-exercise case, Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith (1990), which announced the rule that a \\"neutral, generally applicable\\" law does not run afoul of the Free Exercise Clause even when it prohibits religious exercise in effect. The Court today refers to that rule in dicta, and despite my general agreement with the Court's opinion I do not join Part II, where the dicta appear, for I have doubts about whether the Smith rule merits adherence. I write separately to explain why the Smith rule is not germane to this case and to express my view that, in a case presenting the issue, the Court should re-examine the rule Smith declared.   According to Smith, if prohibiting the exercise of religion results from enforcing a \\"neutral, generally applicable\\" law, the Free Exercise Clause has not been offended. I call this the Smith rule to distinguish it from the noncontroversial principle, also expressed in Smith, though established long before, that the Free Exercise Clause is offended when prohibiting religious exercise results from a law that is not neutral or generally applicable. It is this noncontroversial principle, that the Free Exercise Clause requires neutrality and general applicability, that is at issue here. But before turning to the relationship of Smith to this case, it will help to get the terms in order, for the significance of the Smith rule is not only in its statement that the Free Exercise Clause requires no more than \\"neutrality\\" and \\"general applicability,\\" but in its adoption of a particular, narrow conception of free-exercise neutrality.                    . . .         While general applicability is, for the most part, self-explanatory, free-exercise neutrality is not self-revealing. A law that is religion neutral on its face or in its purpose may lack neutrality in its effect by forbidding something that religion requires . . . . A secular law, applicable to all, that prohibits consumption of alcohol, for example, will affect members of religions that require the use of wine differently from members of other religions and nonbelievers, disproportionately burdening the practice of, say, Catholicism or Judaism. Without an exemption for sacramental wine, Prohibition may fail the test of religion neutrality.   It does not necessarily follow from that observation, of course, that the First Amendment requires an exemption from Prohibition; that depends on the meaning of neutrality as the Free Exercise Clause embraces it. The point here is the unremarkable one that our common notion of neutrality is broad enough to cover not merely what might be called formal neutrality, which as a free-exercise requirement would only bar laws with an object to discriminate against religion, but also what might be called substantive neutrality, which, in addition to demanding a secular object, would generally require government to accommodate religious differences by exempting religious practices from formally neutral laws. If the Free Exercise Clause secures only protection against deliberate discrimination, a formal requirement will exhaust the Clause's neutrality command; if the Free Exercise Clause, rather, safeguards a right to engage in religious activity free from unnecessary governmental interference, the Clause requires substantive, as well as formal, neutrality.   Though Smith used the term \\"neutrality\\" without a modifier, the rule it announced plainly assumes that free-exercise neutrality is of the formal sort. Distinguishing between laws whose \\"object\\" is to prohibit religious exercise and those that prohibit religious exercise as an \\"incidental effect,\\" Smith placed only the former within the reaches of the Free Exercise Clause; the latter, laws that satisfy formal neutrality, Smith would subject to no free-exercise scrutiny at all, even when they prohibit religious exercise in application. The four Justices who rejected the Smith rule, by contrast, read the Free Exercise Clause as embracing what I have termed substantive neutrality. The enforcement of a law \\"neutral on its face,\\" they said, may \\"nonetheless offend  [ the Clause's ]  requirement for government neutrality if it unduly burdens the free exercise of religion.\\" Id., at 896 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.) The rule these Justices saw as flowing from free-exercise neutrality, in contrast to the Smith rule, \\"requir(es) the government to justify any substantial burden on religiously motivated conduct by a compelling state interest and by means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\\" Id., at 894 . . . .   The proposition for which the Smith rule stands, then, is that formal neutrality, along with general applicability, are sufficient conditions for constitutionality under the Free Exercise Clause. That proposition is not at issue in this case, however, for Hialeah's animal-sacrifice ordinances are not neutral under any definition, any more than they are generally applicable. This case, rather, involves the noncontroversial principle repeated in Smith, that formal neutrality and general applicability are necessary conditions for free-exercise constitutionality. . . .   In being so readily susceptible to resolution by applying the Free Exercise Clause's \\"fundamental nonpersecution principle,\\" this is far from a representative free-exercise case. While, as the Court observes, the Hialeah City Council has provided a rare example of a law actually aimed at suppressing religious exercise, Smith was typical of our free-exercise cases, involving as it did a formally neutral, generally applicable law. The rule Smith announced, however, was decidedly untypical of the cases involving the same type of law. Because Smith left those prior cases standing, we are left with a free-exercise jurisprudence in tension with itself, a tension that should be addressed, and that may legitimately be addressed, by re-examining the Smith rule in the next case that would turn upon its application.

She is everywhere, from the pillows to the showers.    THE LOCATION       Hotel Meninas is on Calle Campomanes, which begins in Plaza Isabel II, in front of Teatro Real and the Opera Metro stop, and is a short walk to Plaza Mayor, Puerto del Sol and several hopping clubs. It should be obscenely loud, but Meninas, thankfully, has been soundproofed. The street is a paean to Madrid's new obsession with neo-lounge style: diagonally across the way is the sleek Hotel Mario. Two hipster restaurants complete the minimalist quartet: La Vuida Blanca, which turns into a bar at night, and the spanking new Chic.    THE SCENE       Despite its location close to late-night Madrid, the clientele is primarily business travelers. The lobby feels like a lounge that hasn't opened yet -- hip but crisp and untried. The gray, black and white theme is accented by golds and turquoise. It is, ostensibly, a bar, but we never actually observed anyone drinking. Staff members were mostly pleasant but somewhat formal. After asking for, and receiving, a half-hour delayed checkout, we were called at 12:20 p.m. ''Checkout time is noon,'' the concierge barked. ''Or am I charging you for a second night?''    THE ROOMS       This was a 19th-century town house","excerpt":"the original home is not completely lost in the minimalism design. The central stairway has a lovingly preserved century-old oak floor, a nice touch in a sea of muted color. The halls are striped black, gray, white; a woven industrial-material floor subtly mimics the walls. The color plan continues in the guestrooms -- light gray walls offset by darker gray velveteen chairs and bed skirts, floors are a faux dark wood. Our room with a double bed was considerably smaller than the one I saw with twin beds, with a love seat stuck forlornly staring at a door. The space was otherwise well used, the bed tucked against a far wall facing a black lacquer wood desk that matched the headboard. (Other rooms had more antique-looking headboards, continuing the old-meets-new theme.) Bedding is European -- crisp, fresh white duvets -- and the mattress is exceptionally comfortable. A throw provides a stroke of color, deep green or fluorescent pink. The effect is a 19th-century Parisian loft stripped to bare details.    THE BATHROOMS       Continued minimalism. Light gray marble floors meet dark gray marble walls. The sink is a raised inverted pyramid. No bathtub, though this seemed an exception. The shower was spacious and smartly designed: the floor slopes ever so gently down to a drain in the corner. No-name bath products were plentiful.    AMENITIES       Rooms have flat-screen TV's and DVD players; there is a library of 150 DVD's. The hotel is equipped with wireless and DSL, though it had run out of cables. There were a few odd touches -- bedside light switches were a mystery: three on each side, controlling one light. The minibar was stocked for cocktails; nourishment came in the form of olives and Kit Kats.    ROOM SERVICE/BREAKFAST       Room service is only for dinner. Breakfast is served in the basement, but for 12 euros (about $15 with the euro valued at $1.26) it is skippable. The buffet was a standard display of moderately tasty pastries, cheeses, meats and juices. Breakfast is advertised as 7 to 11 a.m., but on a Sunday we arrived at 10:45 a.m. to find it all but depleted. Were there eggs? ''There were,'' was the curt reply.

It began as one part of a six-part study of Napoleon, had its premier at the Paris Opera in 1927, but was scarcely seen after that except in mutilated and much diminished versions. Gance himself has accused Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer of buying the film and then virtually suppressing it, so that its expensive wide-screen, three-camera technique (a precursor to Cinerama) should not endanger the profits of an industry that already felt itself threatened by the coming of sound.The other five parts of \\"Napoleon\\" were never made, but in the nineteen-thirties, Gance prepared a sound version, valuable at the very least for preserving the voice of Antonin Artaud, who played Marat. The current film draws upon both versions, though it uses a screen of conventional size, rearranges material, adds some new footage, including a fine introduction by Gance at 82, adds music (Beethoven's 5th Symphony","excerpt":"the original score was by Arthur Honegger) and provides the silent action with some voice-over narration and much dialogue. The post-synchronizing of the dialogue, credited to Claude Pessis, is spectacularly successful, and it may rank with Polyvision and the triptych screen (and color and, on a lost reel, 3-D) among the technical marvels of this all but legendary movie.Gance himself is now part of the legend. He is as old as the art he serves, a master unknown to most audiences, and his romantic study of a personal history has become his own history, wonderfully vindicated in a work that, like the man, could scarcely ever have seemed much younger. For all its four and one-half hours, its multitude of effects, its elaborate visual rhetoric, its willingness to make every point more than once, \\"Bonaparte and the Revolution\\" moves with a vitality that any film made yesterday might envy and that almost none can equal.The movie deals with Napoleon through his young manhood, roughly from the beginnings of his military career through his marriage to Josephine de Beauharnais (Gina Manes) and the Italian campaign of 1796. But considerable attention is given to the Revolution, to the meetings of the Convention and to the Reign of Terror, and the film's most remarkable portraits surely are those of Marat (Artaud), Danton (Alexandre Koubitsky), Saint-Just (Gance himself) and above all an almost expressionless and coldly terrifying Robespierre (Van Daele).The actual relation of Bonaparte to the Revolution is often tenuous, though in making that relation Gance achieves some of his most startling effects. Napoleon is seen on the one hand as destined to spread the spirit of the Revolution over the lands he is to conquer, and on the other, as embodying a principle of disciplined will that seems exactly counter to the actual spirit of the Revolution as the film unflatteringly presents it.But for all his magnificent scope, Gance is more interesting with personal stories than with national destiny, and his Napoleon (Albert Dieudonne) is a figure of subtle and, in context, rather surprising complexity. Thus the great purple passages in \\"Bonaparte and the Revolution\\" — for example, the famous intercutting between Napoleon in an open boat, the tricolor for his sail, tempest-tossed in his 1792 escape from Corsica; and the tempestuous Convention, photographed as if by a wave-borne camera — seem grand, but not as grand as the rich and sophisticated interplay of light and shadow, dream and reality, character and event, in the technically less imposing courtship and marriage of Napoleon and Josephine.However, there is no point at which \\"Bonaparte and the Revolution\\" is less than a wonderful old movie and a marvelous new one. And in this excellently titled version I hope it remains permanently available for American audiences. Abel Gance's Movie on Napoleon"},{"year":"1974","title":"The Rangers rare chasing Philadelphia.

The assumption was that choosing one occupation was sufficient. Some people are finding, however, that life's unexpected challenges create opportunities that keep them from lamenting roads not taken. What's required is guts, resilience and a change of clothes.   GOLF CLOTHES USED TO LOOK pretty bad. But they're getting better: colors are less vivid, patterns are more subtle, fabrics have more texture. These clothes can give you freedom on the course. I want the 1,500 people who work for me to convey that sense of ease as well -- relaxed yet smart. Still, I'm a lot more dressed up than when all I dealt with all day were farmers and dirt. People were surprised when I didn't sell the vineyards and just retire. But retirement is the best prescription for an early death. Human beings need to be active mentally and physically in order to thrive. And I am. I don't even have time for golf. I have a business to run. ELY CALLAWAY, THIS PAGE  Former vintner, now the chairman and C.E.O. of Callaway Golf, creator of Big Bertha Clubs, Carlsbad, Calif.   BOTH MY CAREERS HAVE BEEN people-oriented, but the former was about pleasing the audience on a short- term basis, whereas the present is about dealing with their long-term welfare. In my heart, I'll always be casual, but obviously it's not only about me anymore. Still, it's dressing for another stage, and it's fun picking out the right suits, shoes, the perfect tie that correspond to the development of your personality, just as a sheepskin vest was apt for another time. Though I have to admit, when I compare myself then and now, I duck a little.

The acceptance takes much longer. Still, it's funny how it's no longer as necessary for me to give off this impression of strength. My ears are what count now, so I can give my body a rest. I can wear things that cover myself more and look less intimidating. It may not be as physically impressive, but I feel more grown-up. I'd like to think that's why people now treat me differently. But no matter what, my family will always treat me like I'm 12 years old. DERRICK SMIT, THIS PAGE  Former security guard and gym manager, now independent record producer   I THOUGHT COMPUTERS WOULD BE the industry to be in. I still admire the technology, but not corporate climates and ethics. Running my own company made me realize big business's real problem is lack of communication. My volunteer work led me to the idea of opening Earth General in Brooklyn,where we sell environmentally honest products -- cleaning solutions, health and beauty aids, apparel made from organic and recycled materials -- to help people take better care of themselves. Part of that care is dressing in what is natural, easy to care for and soothing. I'm sure it increases productivity, besides making people feel better about themselves. And a healthier attitude makes a healthier planet. STEFAN DOERING, OPPOSITE PAGE, TOP Former computer systems manager, now president of Earth General   ANYONE WHO HAS A TRAGIC accident has to go through denial and self-pity. But then you have to leave the world of hurt and get on with the rest of your life. I've always loved nature, but as a park ranger, I was content showing people where to buy rubber tomahawks and find the bathroom. Now, thanks to modern technology, I can show other physically challenged people that rock climbing, skiing and kayaking are not beyond their reach. Nor do they have to feel disabled. I move gracefully in that chair, I love sports, I wear whatever I like. When people spend time with me, they stop thinking about the wheelchair and start thinking about Mark Wellman. MARK WELLMAN, RIGHT Former park ranger and professional rock climber, now a motivational speaker and film maker based in Truckee, Calif.   I WANTED SOME TIME OFF AFTER college. Modeling, however, turned out to be a six-year sidetrack, and though I'm grateful for the traveling and the friends I've made, this is what I've always wanted to do. Surgery is disciplined and, accordingly, requires certain restrictions in dress. Patients have expectations. They want to see me in a white coat, surgical greens or a suit. But you can be comfortable while inspiring confidence. I choose suits that are a little bigger, roomier, that let me reach. My detour may be responsible for my being the oldest resident studying plastic surgery, but the way I figure it, by the time I get out, I can work on all my friends. They're not getting any younger either. MARK WARFEL, THIS PAGE Former model, now a second-year resident in surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City   MY WIFE SAYS THAT WHEN I FIRST moved in with her, all I brought with me were 15 uniforms. I never gave a thought to what I wore, just how it looked. So when I started banking, I really did think I was just going from one uniform to another.

But I'm discovering I've been limiting myself. What looks like a uniform doesn't have to feel like a uniform.

The preview audience was made up of specialists from the fields of camping, education, social work, youth guidance and psychiatry.The plight of any child who differs outstandingly from the rest was made clear in a passage that showed white and Negro youngsters at the start of the camping period joining forces to badger an Italian refugee boy whose English was poor and who differed from the others in background, interests and mannerisms.From Two City AreasThe groups of children at the camp came from two districts of Chicago—one a Negro section with very few white residents","excerpt":"the other a racially tense area, predominatly white, into which Negroes were beginning to move.

Each of the 10 selections simply represents either the first or second feature by a promising new director not yet known in this country.On the basis of the quality and intensity (if not always the complete success) of the festival's first five film's, which I saw this week, it's particularly disappointing to learn that the series—ending Monday night—is attracting something less than capacity audiences.The show is the first major collaboration of New York's two most imposing film establishments since the \\"American Voices\\" series, which they presented in conjunction with the 8th New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center in 1970. More importantly, the show is providing some talented young filmmakers with the kind of unhurried presentation not possible at a more or less conventional festival, where the Buñuels, the Bergmans, the Godards and the Olmis occupy the attention (with, I should add, some justification).Following the lead of the selection committee, I won't attempt to impose a theme on my report on the first half of the festival. The order in which the films are discussed is the chronological order in which they were seen:\\"Dear Irene\\" is the first feature by two young Danish film critics, Ch. Braad Thomsen, who directed the film and wrote the screenplay with Mette Knudsen, who plays the title role. Irene pretends to be politically concerned but she's actually bored with everything—her husband, her lover and her job.For a film about boredom, \\"Dear Irene\\" is remarkably humane and unmannered and, finally, very touching as Irene finds herself literally cornered, in a freeze frame, a likely recruit to the ranks of the alienated strangers whom she encounters, talking to themselves, in an anything but gay Copenhagen. Mr. Thomsen's techniques are not new, but the emotions are always genuine.\\"The Role of My Family in the World Revolution,\\" the second feature by Bata Cengic, is another chaotic Marxist political comedy from Yugoslavia, the country that gave us Makavejev's \\"WR—The Mysteries of the Organism\\" for no great gain. The movie utilizes slapstick comedy techniques, songs, sketches (Adolf and Eva Hitler spending an evening at home with TV) and a number of eccentric actors to pass on what seems to me to be an especially mysterious kind of cynicism (perhaps because I'm not Yugoslav).\\"The Truce\\" (French), the first feature to be directed by Claude Guillemot, is a long, gentle gag film about two Parisian con artists, rivals at their trade, who, with their doxies, spend a very funny weekend in the country, which is, of course, alien ground. One of them likes to fish, not with a pole but with hand grenades","excerpt":"the other by electrifying the waters. Nicely acted by Daniel Gelin and Charles Denner, and very very mild.\\"Dot Dot Dot\\" (meaning \\". . .\\" for the ellipses used in writing) is the first feature by Edgardo Cozarinsky, a young Argentine whose program notes for the film are much more eloquent than the film itself. From the notes I learn that the film is about a priest who has been defrocked because his views are too right-wing even for the church. (I wouldn't have known otherwise.) The style of the film is nothing if not elliptical, but its comments on the Argentine church and on the bourgeoisie are sometimes quite funny.\\"The Anxiety of the Goalie at the Penalty Kick\\" is the second feature by Wim Wenders, a young German director. Based on a novel to be published here next month by Peter Handke, the film is the most ambitious and most successful of the museum series so far, a beautifully acted and photographed tale of existential alienation, set in a world that is all the more terrifying because it is so familiar. It will deserve further comment when, as I hope, it finds a commercial release here. Talent Festival"},{"year":"1992","title":"At Mayor David N.

Once understood as prohibiting state actions that endorse, benefit or advance religion, the clause has in recent decades been re-read in ways that permit, among other things, taxpayer financing of evangelical student newspapers and the construction of buildings at sectarian (mostly Christian) schools. This result has been accomplished by shifting the inquiry from the traditional establishment clause question – does this amount to government funding of religious activities? – to a free expression clause question – would denying the religious institution this benefit or subsidy be an unfair instance of viewpoint discrimination? By substituting the requirement of fairness for an investigation of a law’s effects, the courts have moved dramatically away from James Madison’s insistence that not even three pence of public funds should be spent for religious purposes and have rendered the establishment clause nugatory.Some of those who commented on the column attributed the pattern I described to the nefarious forces of organized religion or to the machinations of the Bush administration (always the default villain for Times readers), but a deeper explanation might be found in a religion-clause jurisprudence so fissured that one might even call it schizophrenic. The division is between two views of the assumptions that should be kept in mind when an establishment clause case or a free exercise case is being adjudicated. One view stresses history and cultural traditions","excerpt":"the other embraces the iron logic of principle. The Religion Clause Divided Against Itself"},{"year":"1991","title":"THE REV. WILLIAM A. KOLB of St. Thomas Episcopal Church here says it is a way to fulfill a mission to help people in need. Members of the Mamaroneck Historical Society say they fear that it might violate the integrity of a structure that has been standing since 1865. \\n\\nThe issue is a proposed change in the use of Flandreau Cottage, a French Second Empire-style building on Mount Pleasant Avenue here. For most of its existence, the cottage has been a private residence. Since 1965, it has been the church rectory, home to the rector and his family. In 1978, Mr. Kolb moved into the cottage, where he lives with his wife, Eleanor. \\n\\nNow the church would like Flandreau Cottage to have new occupants: members of the Samaritan House residential program. \\n\\nThe program, in the words of its director, Meg Hammerling, helps \\"people gain skills in independent living.\\" Samaritan House workers and staff members of social service and mental-health agencies conduct classes in parenting, tutor, give vocational training and conduct counseling sessions.\\nThe Samaritan House Program \\n\\n Many Samaritan House participants have been homeless, and many have had drug and alcohol problems. To enter and remain in the program, however, one must be registered in a treatment program and submit to periodic tests to confirm the absence of drugs or alcohol.\\n\\nSince its inception 13 years ago, Samaritan House has operated from the parish house at Grace Episcopal Church in White Plains. But in 1989, the church sold the air rights to that part of its property and construction of an office building is to begin this winter. So Samaritan House must move out for at least 18 months. The hope is that whatever new site Samaritan House occupies will become a permanent second home after the program returns to Grace Church. \\n\\nLast fall, after a house in Rye was rejected because of community opposition, a member of the Samaritan House board contacted Mr. Kolb about possible sites on the Sound shore. The rector convened a meeting of local clergy, but no location emerged. Then in March, a subcommittee of the St. Thomas vestry recommended to the vestry and the congregation that Flandreau Cottage be offered. (The church would find another house for the rector.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the vestry will meet with the two wardens and the rector to vote on establishing the St. Thomas Housing Corporation, a nonprofit group separate from the church that could apply for Federal Housing and Urban Development grants to run Samaritan House. \\n\\nThe plan would also need approval from the Mamaroneck Village Board of Trustees or the zoning board, and early next year would be the earliest possible date of occupancy for Samaritan House. But some in the church feel spiritually ready now. \\n\\n\\"We have decided to live more of our faith rather than just talk about it,\\" said Jeffrey R. Shearman, the church's senior warden. \\"We started to examine what kind of stewards we wanted to be. We looked at our mission and decided we wanted to be better stewards of what we possessed.\\" \\nA Vision of Something Larger \\n\\n Citing their involvement in outreach programs, including taking food and clothing to the homeless in New York City in recent years, Mr. Kolb said: \\"The people of this parish have been becoming more intimately involved with what is their responsibility and duty with regard to their faith. People have gotten a vision of being involved in something larger than themselves, which can change the lives of those reaching out.\\n\\n\\"This sort of activity can help the helper as well as the helpee. When a task causes a person to grow closer to God, and at the same time that task serves God by helping those in need, truly the Holy Spirit is at work at His most powerful.\\" \\n\\nIn meetings on the project, many members of the church appeared to favor it. But others are opposed. \\n\\nAmong the latter is Grace Huntley Pugh, a church member, past president of the Mamaroneck Historical Society and a former Village and Town Historian. \\"I am completely against it,\\" she said recently. \\"I think Samaritan House is a wonderful program, but please -- not in this house. This is a beautiful historic house and I think it should go on being a rectory.\\" \\n\\nMembers of the historical society unaffiliated with the church have also expressed concern. Donald March, president of the society, said the focus was not on what type of tenants Samaritan House would have, but on what would happen to the building, which he said was believed to be the \\"last stately mansion\\" of its era overlooking both Mamaroneck Harbor and Boston Post Road.\\n\\n Paul Segal Associates, the Manhattan-based architectural firm retained to study the cottage, said alterations would be kept to a minimum, complying with safety codes but in strict keeping with the Second Empire style.\\n\\n\\"Imagine the house when it was built,\\" Mr. March said. \\"There it was, perched on that hill, all alone. You wonder how it survived lightning, fires, floods, wars. It has stood as a sentinel all this time. Now, we don't know if it can withstand the patter of 19 pairs of feet.\\" \\n\\nIn a recent letter to parishoners, Mayor Paul J. Noto and the Village Trustees, Gloria Poccia Pritts, the Town and Village Historian, wrote: \\"Yes, we should and must help unfortunates in whatever way we can. But, as Jesus said, 'The poor will be with us always.' On the other hand, we do have an obligation to future citizens of Mamaroneck to maintain our community's memorable historic heritage whenever we can.\\" \\n\\nSt. Thomas was founded in 1814. People worshiped in each other's homes until 1823, when a modest white wood church was built on Mount Pleasant Avenue. In 1886, the Constable family paid for the construction of the current church, an English Gothic-style building of reddish stone. The parish house, in a similar style, was also begun then. \\n\\nFlandreau Cottage, built in 1865 for the John Flandreau family, was originally clapboard and in 1916 it was covered with off-white stucco. The three-story house has a mansard roof, a wraparound porch supported by twin columns, decorative woodwork and arched dormer windows. \\nExpensive to Maintain \\n\\n The house passed through several families before St. Thomas bought it in 1965. The church's five-acre property also includes the church itself, the parish hall with offices and classrooms, and a large frame house where several staff members live. \\n\\nBut the cottage rectory has been expensive to maintain: recent costs have run from $25,000 to $35,000 a year, said Anne Timmerman, the church's finance chairwoman. Several years ago, the vestry rejected the idea of selling the property to a developer, who would have razed it to make way for condominiums. \\n\\nAt a recent meeting of the historical society, the church leadership and Samaritan House, Joan Krevlin of Paul Segal Associates said the change in occupancy would \\"be an opportunity to preserve the house because of Federal funds that would be made available\\" for restoration.\\n\\nDescribing the changes necessary to comply with safety codes, she said that \\"very little\\" would need to be done to the interior but that two staircases would be added outside the house to conform to fire codes. One would be incorporated into a porchlike structure in the rear","excerpt":"the other encased in a three-story tower of matching stucco with mansard roof. \\nSketches of the Changes \\n\\n After seeing sketches of the proposed changes and slides of existing Second Empire buildings with similar towers, some members of the historical society were still not convinced. \\n\\n\\"They're trying to soften the blow, but I think the tower is ugly,\\" Mrs. Pritts said. \\"I have driven past that house for so many, many years. It just hurts to think of change.\\" \\n\\nMrs. Pugh said she believed that the historical society could work toward obtaining landmark status for the building and raise funds that way for repair work.\\n\\nWhen they heard of the Samaritan House proposal last month, several historical society members, including Mrs. Pugh, circulated letters and petitions in opposition. A recent meeting with the church and Samaritan House officials \\"helped open up a dialogue, which we intend to continue,\\" Mr. March said. He added that the society had not decided what it would recommend to village officials.\\n\\nMrs. Hammerling said there was a certain amount of resistance in the village that was based on fear. \\n\\n\\"Someone -- we don't know who -- has circulated erroneous information,\\" she said, citing a letter that stated there had been more than 100 calls placed by Samaritan House staff in White Plains to the police in the last year. Mrs. Hammerling called this \\"totally untrue,\\" because the records reflected calls made by other programs that serve the homeless in the Grace Church area.\\nCandles on a Cake \\n\\n \\"In fact, Samaritan House itself only called the police 17 times last year,\\" she said. \\"And all of those calls involved medical emergencies or minor safety mishaps, such as a fire alarm going off because of candles on a birthday cake.\\"\\n\\nAmong St. Thomas parishoners who favor the Samaritan House plan are Brian Styer, who called it \\"an important part of our church mission,\\" and Connie Ellison, who said \\"it is an opportunity to give a break to those who need it.\\"\\n\\nAlso at the recent meeting was Adrienne Testemark, a 24-year-old graduate of the Samaritan House program. \\"I think people at Samaritan House are going to be extra conscientious,\\" she said. \\"They're not allowed to use drugs or alcohol, even socially. As a result, we have to use our heads.\\" THE VIEW FROM: ST.

Set on the island of Grand Cayman, a British territory and a thriving banking center, the Ritz is all about tasteful opulence, with partnerships with La Prairie spa and Eric Ripert, chef of Le Bernardin in New York, ratcheting up the luxury factor on an island already known for its first-rate diving and snorkeling.    THE LOCATION -- The hotel is set on 144 acres that extend from Seven Mile beach, a stretch of pure white sand along the Caribbean waters, to the North Sound. The Ritz-Carlton is divided into two buildings: one, the Waterway, faces the lagoon and houses the lobby, restaurants, spa and guest rooms","excerpt":"the other faces the ocean. The buildings are connected by a long, furnished corridor that doubles as a gallery of local art (for sale, of course). The Waterway rooms are the least expensive and also look out over a water channel, the hotel's smaller pool and the golf course (to be ready for play in April).    THE LOBBY -- Inside the front door, guests are greeted with a welcome table set with chocolate-chip cookies and fruit punch (there is a bottle of rum for those craving an instant tropical buzz). Just beyond is the Silver Palm Lounge and a smokers' terrace; the entire hotel is nonsmoking except for this terrace and the bar.    THE ROOMS -- The Ocean View double I stayed in was a comfortable size (480 square feet) with two queen beds covered in 600-thread-count linens from Italy, and a balcony with two rattan chairs and a table overlooking the bigger pool and the beach beyond. Among the furnishings were a club chair, a marble-topped table, an armoire with TV and DVD player, and a desk equipped with high-speed Internet access (Wi-Fi Internet service is $10 a day). A rattan ceiling fan circulated the air nicely.    THE BATHROOM -- The bathroom was spacious, light and basically nondescript (save for a missing trash can and a Siamese fighting fish that swam around a vase on the counter). I was hoping for La Prairie products, given the spa's presence on the property, but made do with the soaps, shampoo and conditioner from Lady Primrose.    AMENITIES -- Nick Bollettieri, a former instructor to Andre Agassi and Monica Seles, is the name behind the tennis program (there are three clay courts and, for Wimbledon would-be's, one grass court), and the golf course was designed by Greg Norman. The Silver Rain spa is the first in the Caribbean for La Prairie. Nature lovers of all ages can take part in a program linking ocean life and education by Jean-Michel Cousteau called Ambassadors of the Environment. (I loved both of my experiences -- a kayak trip through nearby mangroves and snorkeling with a school of rays.)    ROOM SERVICE -- An extensive menu is available for 24-hour in-room dining with some limitations between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. -- but still good choices like Caesar salad with sautéed shrimp ($14.40) and a black truffle chicken club sandwich ($12). The children's menu includes a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich with fries for $7 and spaghetti with pomodoro sauce for $6. A morning pot of coffee arrived at my door 11 minutes after it was ordered.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- Luxury doesn't come cheap at the Ritz. During the high season, through May, rates start at $699 for a Waterway room and $929 for an Ocean Front room, and go as high as $5,000 for the 2,400-square-foot Ritz-Carlton suite overlooking the ocean. (Rates dip to $299, Waterway, and $499, Ocean Front, during the lowest season, Sept. 5 through October).

MEN VS. WOMEN"},{"year":"1991","title":"All the World's a Screen   Should it come as any surprise that Peter Weir speaks in screenplay?   \\"Dissolve to two years later,\\" he said.   Mr. Weir, the Australian film maker whose credits include \\"Picnic at Hanging Rock,\\" \\"Witness\\" and \\"Dead Poets Society,\\" was talking about how he came to write and direct \\"Green Card,\\" starring France's ubiquitous Gerard Depardieu in his first major English-speaking role.   \\"It was a story line I had for some time,\\" Mr. Weir said, noting that he knew English people who had married Americans to obtain a green card, which identifies them as permanent residents and which permits them to work in the United States.    That's what Mr. Depardieu does in the romantic comedy when he weds an American horticulturist (Andie MacDowell) who needs to be married to rent the New York apartment of her dreams. Their marriage of convenience then comes under the scrutiny of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.   \\"I thought it was a good subject for a film,\\" Mr. Weir said. \\"I always thought it was a comedy: a marriage being investigated. I know the larger question is a very serious one.\\"   Anyway, the idea lay dormant. Thus the dissolve to two years later. Peter and Wendy Weir are leaving a theater at the end of a film.   \\"My wife and I were walking out of yet another movie starring Gerard Depardieu, and I said, 'God, I'd like to work with that guy.' And she said: 'Well, you've got that green-card story. Why don't you change it from an Englishman to a Frenchman?' \\"   Not long afterward, in fact, Mr. Depardieu went to Sydney, Australia, and the director found himself sorely tempted to approach the actor with his idea. But he said he thought that if Mr. Depardieu had any reservations about working in English for the first time, it might be better to try to tempt him with a fully developed idea.   \\"There was no question from the time I sat down to write that piece that I tailored it for him,\\" Mr. Weir said. \\"I looked at as many films as I could get on video here in Sydney that I hadn't seen, plus some old favorites, so that as I wrote, I would be drawing on everything I had loved about his many, many performances and character: his charm, his humor, the wonderful mystery that clings about this man.   \\"I think I became aware as I wrote that this was a chance to introduce him to English speakers who did not go to foreign movies, and therefore did not know his work. Having completed it, I was really painted well and truly into a corner. There was no way I could recast it.\\"   This was in the middle of 1988.   Mr. Weir failed to reach Mr. Depardieu by telephone. Although Mr. Weir had intended to make the film as an independent production, he went to Walt Disney Studios in Los Angeles, planning to increase the appeal of the project to Mr. Depardieu by having guaranteed distribution. Mr. Weir shook hands on a deal with Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios , who suggested that the director fly to France to talk to the actor.    \\"Gerard and I met the morning after I arrived, and we ended by talking for three days,\\" Mr. Weir said. \\"He didn't speak much English, and I didn't speak much French. We spoke in these two broken languages, put them together and had kind of one language. The point was, we wanted to communicate.\\"   There was only one problem: Mr. Depardieu was unavailable for a year, being committed to four movies, the last being \\"Cyrano de Bergerac.\\"   \\"So I said to him, 'I'll wait, of course.' I was very disappointed.\\"   Mr. Weir went back to Los Angeles. Mr. Katzenberg said he had an idea about the way Mr. Weir could spend his time while waiting for Mr. Depardieu. He handed him a script: \\"Dead Poets Society.\\"   Now that both \\"Dead Poets Society\\" and \\"Green Card\\" are on celluloid, Mr. Weir said, \\"I'm taking a break.\\" He's enjoying summer in Sydney.   \\"I feel deliciously free,\\" he said. \\"I think I always do this.

Assigned to investigate a series of near-perfect bank robberies, Mr. Reeves is called upon to go undercover among the maverick fringe of Southern California surfers, and Mr. Swayze becomes his mentor.    \\"It's two men who become embroiled in a sort of psychological entanglement that ultimately becomes life-threatening,\\" Ms. Bigelow said.

While Lou Reed the musician sings authoritatively about heroin and sadomasochism, Lou Reed the photographer focuses on river, sunsets and abstract cityscapes. At the Kasher gallery on a recent morning, Mr. Reed spoke with Ben Sisario about the island he calls home, the photographs he has taken of it, his forthcoming book of them (''Lou Reed's New York'') and the gallery space they now share with high-end accessories.    Q. So if someone were to say there's a photography show called Lou Reed's ''New York'' --    A. Well, there is.    Q. One might expect images of people. But this is almost nature photography. The city as nature.    A. Exactly. It's water and light. We're an island. You forget we're an island. And I like that. There's this whole other thing to New York. It's very, very beautiful. I keep seeing it and saying, ''My God, look that this.''    Q. It's easy to forget that in this city of buildings there are such beautiful sunsets.    A. They're really there. If you don't believe me, you go down to the Hudson River. Watch what happens. Last week there was one that was so astonishing. The book's done, but I just can't stop doing this. You just go, ''My God, who's doing this light show?''    Q. So  why Hermès?    A. Because the owner of Hermès is a big fine art and photography fan. I went over there, and they had a Ralph Gibson show, on the top floor of Hermès, of all places. So I thought, ''Wow!'' And then they asked me would I like to do it. I mean, you don't get paid or anything. You don't get a free Hermès scarf, either.    Q. Do you like their scarves?    A. No, I don't own one thing from Hermès because I can't afford it. But I don't want to have to make excuses about ''Why are you showing something at a store on the Upper East Side''? That would be really boring to have to go through that. I'm just interested in showing these pictures of this city in a nice setting.    Q. Does it say anything about New York that Lou Reed has a show at Hermès?    A. It's part of the charm of the city that you can be in two places at once. What I was interested in was having more people have the opportunity to see the photographs, and the person who's in charge of Hermès loves photography and loves being able to show photographs and photographers. So I think the impulses are all correct.

Leonard Schiller is an out-of-print novelist in his 70's whose intensely ordered life is shaken by the arrival of a young woman who wants to write a master's thesis on his work. Last year our reviewer, William H. Pritchard, called this a sad novel that nonetheless ''works toward affirming and enhancing life. . . . As a piece of writing, it's nothing less than a triumph.''    Cold New World: Growing Up in a Harder Country   By William Finnegan. Modern Library, $14.95.    These four bleak portraits of young people left behind by America's bustling economy explore how and why they came to be drawn into lives ruled by drugs, crime, gangs and extremism. ''The cumulative effect is to create an unusual kind of sympathy,'' Jack Hitt wrote here last year. ''Finnegan convincingly connects the wayward events in these people's lives to the messages and forces they detect around them.'' A Hope in the Unseen: An American Odyssey From the Inner City to the Ivy League, by Ron Suskind (Broadway, $13), is a more optimistic dispatch, based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning series in The Wall Street Journal, that chronicles the struggle of a poor black teen-ager to lift himself from his blighted Washington high school into Brown University. In 1998 our reviewer, Sara Mosle, called this an ''extraordinary, formula-shattering book.''    Some Tame Gazelle   By Barbara Pym. Moyer Bell, $11.95.    The author's first novel, originally published in Britain in 1950, is about two middle-aged sisters living in an English village: one is hopelessly in love with the local vicar","excerpt":"the other has a thing for young curates. In 1983 Michael Gorra, reviewing the first American edition here, said the story ''has all the quiet skill, the tough, reasonable wit and . . . the calm integrity of Pym's best work.''    Genuine Reality: A Life of William James   By Linda Simon. University of Chicago, $18.    This biography of America's most famous philosopher (and the brother of Henry James) reveals how his ideas were linked to his own experiences, including his troubled relationship with his father, and how he spent a lifetime coping with severe depression. The author ''vivifies William James in such a way that his life and thought come freshly alive for the modern reader,'' David S. Reynolds wrote here in 1998. In Alice James: A Biography, by Jean Strouse (Harvard University, $18.95), the youngest of the James siblings is shown to have been a formidable figure in her own right: even though mysterious illnesses rendered her an invalid for most of her life, she was a gifted, enigmatic woman whose intellectual powers intensified over time. In 1980 our reviewer, Diane Johnson, called this a ''judicious and beautifully written biography.''    Loves That Bind   By Julin Rios. Vintage International, $12.    The narrator of this Spanish novel recounts his amorous exploits in a series of letters addressed to an unnamed lover who has abandoned him in London. Last year in these pages, Abigail Lee Six admired the author's ''virtuoso use of language: multilingual puns, neologisms galore, dazzling networks of extended metaphor.''    Will This Do?  The First Fifty Years of Auberon Waugh: An Autobiography  Carroll & Graf, $13.95.    The son of Evelyn Waugh recalls life with father, who not surprisingly was exasperating and extremely hard to please, as well as the rest of his childhood and his own literary travails. The result is ''a modest but terrifically entertaining book that's funny, acerbic and a little sad,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in The Times in 1998.    The Long Falling   By Keith Ridgway. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.    The murder of an abusive husband by his long-suffering wife in rural Ireland is portrayed as an understandable act that raises a disturbing question: Is the taking of another's life ever justifiable? Last year our reviewer, Rosemary Mahoney, called this first novel skillfully drawn and ''at times excruciatingly suspenseful.''    Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard   By Kiran Desai. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95.    In this opulent Indian novel, a young man climbs a guava tree to escape his fellow humans and finds himself revered as a prophet by both the local villagers and the local monkeys. ''It's a parable, an allegory, a bittersweet reminder of the chaos of India,'' Zia Jaffrey wrote here last year.    About This Life: Journeys on the Threshold of Memory  By Barry Lopez. Vintage, $13.    These essays cover a lot of geographic and imaginative territory, from Hokkaido and Antarctica to the author's childhood and the subject of air freight, but at their core is a fascination with the role of landscape in one's life. ''Lyrical prose is Lopez's trademark,'' Sara Wheeler wrote here in 1998. ''I enjoyed this rich book hugely.''    The Translator  By Ward Just. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.    The hero of this novel is an expatriate German in Paris who can't shake his past -- and his memories of World War II -- when he's called on to help an old friend at the end of the cold war.

To create this intimate yet nonjudgmental portrait, the author spent 10 years with an impoverished, loosely connected family in the Bronx. Her tale centers on two Puerto Rican girls: one has three children before hooking up with a heroin dealer and winding up in prison","excerpt":"the other has two children by the first girl's half-brother and three more by other men but manages to persevere. LeBlanc's ''extraordinary'' work, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2003, is ''a painstaking feat of reporting and of empathy,'' Margaret Talbot wrote here.    GOODNIGHT, NOBODY, by Michael Knight. (Grove, $12.) Veering between Southern Gothicism and snarky postmodernism, these nine stories focus on people like an academic who is tormented by his children after throwing out his back while vacuuming, and an ornithologist who falls in love with a driftwood whittler after trailing a flock of displaced African parrots to Alabama. ''Knight has that rare power . . . to make a setting breathe, to invest it with a vitality that seems as authentic and intense as the pulsebeats of his characters,'' Jonathan Miles said here last year.    READING LOLITA IN TEHRAN: A Memoir in Books, by Azar Nafisi. (Random House, $13.95.) Recalling her life in Iran from the late 1970's to the late 90's, a teacher tells of a group of Iranian women students who gathered weekly to talk freely about Western literature and their own daily hardships. In the process, she provides a ''visceral and often harrowing portrait of the Islamic revolution in that country'' and ''an eloquent brief on the transformative powers of fiction,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in The Times last year.    EMMA'S WAR, by Deborah Scroggins. (Vintage, $15.) This account of the Sudanese civil war is built around the short life of an adventurous, recklessly brave British aid worker whose affair with a rebel commander undermines her mission and alienates her from most of her expatriate friends. ''Scroggins brings Sudan's agony to vivid life; at the same time, she gives us a lyrical, suspenseful, psychologically acute study in idealism and self-delusion,'' George Packer wrote here in 2002.    THE SPIDER'S HOUSE, by Paul Bowles. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $14.95.) Less brooding and soul-searching than ''The Sheltering Sky,'' this 1955 novel explores the conflict between the French and the Arabs in Morocco by focusing on the intertwined lives of an American novelist and a 15-year-old Arab boy. Our reviewer, Charles J. Rolo, found the plot meandering and a bit fuzzy, but said the story ''reads for stretches like a first-class political thriller.''    THE MASTER BUTCHERS SINGING CLUB, by Louise Erdrich. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) Though Erdrich's eighth novel is set on her home turf in the fictional town of Argus, N.D., this time she shifts her focus from the town's Indian population toward its mainly German, Polish and Scandinavian residents. The tale spins out from the experiences of a German World War I sniper who marries his best friend's pregnant widow and moves to America, where he sets up as a master butcher and eventually becomes entangled with the daughter of the town drunk. The book is flawed, Brooke Allen wrote here in 2003, but Erdrich manages ''to bring a little-known part of the country redolently to life.''    OF MOTHS AND MEN: An Evolutionary Tale. The Untold Story of Science and the Peppered Moth, by Judith Hooper. (Norton, $15.95.) The author examines how the most famous example of natural selection in action -- the population explosion of dark moths in England's grimy industrial areas -- became the most infamous. It turns out the researcher who ''proved'' Darwin right may have seen only what he wanted to see. The result is a ''moving and compassionate portrait'' of scientists undone by myopia and cold ambition, Paul Raeburn wrote here in 2002.    THE SPINNING MAN, by George Harrar. (BlueHen, $14.) A mild-mannered philosophy professor finds his comfy world turned upside down when he's arrested in connection with the disappearance of a 16-year-old cheerleader.

The Penner picture, \\"College Rhythm,\\" opened yesterday at the Paramount and proves just how wrong one can be in pre-judging a film. Even an anti-Pennerite must report that the originator of such horrible catchphrases as \\"You nasty man\\" and \\"Don't do that,\\" not to mention \\"Do you wanna buy a duck?\\" is an amiable and likable comedian on the screen. Yesterday's audience seemed to be with him to a man.It is a question, of course, how much of this credit is due to Mr. Penner and how much to the honeyed tenor of Lanny Ross, to the flipness of Jack Oakie, to the accented Lyda Roberti, to the attractive Misses Brian and Mack, to the direction of Norman Taurog, to the words and music of Gordon and Revel. It is a question, but not an especially important one. Let the bows be shared evenly.For \\"College Rhythm\\" is a mad and generally merry concoction, unbelievable, nonsensical and designed solely for eye and ear amusement. To accomplish this end it presents Mr. Penner crooning a love song to his duck, Goo-Goo. It converts a department store into a collegiate variety show. It has a football game in which scores are made by such villainous tricks as firing the half-gun beforehand, turning off the field lights while a play is being run, and having the back field stand three-high to cross the line. It even has a group of chorus girls billed as the All-American Co-eds.Casting all these aside for the moment and concentrating on the plot—not that it requires much concentration—one discovers that the picture is concerned, though not unduly, with the careers of a football star and a piccolo player in the college band. After graduation the tables of fame are turned, one being the son of a department store owner","excerpt":"the other having to apply to his scorned rival for a job at the ribbon counter.

A romance is settled on the playing field and the team's mascots, Mr. Penner and his duck, rise to heights of glory.As may be inferred, the plot hangs by less than a thread and the saving grace of the film is its ability to capitalize on the singing talents of Mr. Ross, the charm of Miss Roberti, the handsomeness of Misses Brian and Mack and Mr. Penner's clowning.

By Peter Hebblethwaite.  Illustrated. 550 pp. New York: Doubleday & Company. $19.95.     PETER HEBBLETHWAITE'S new biography of Pope John XXIII comes close to solving the enigma of the septuagenarian who was elected as a transitional pope and started a revolution. But it does not quite solve that enigma. Unexplained by the author after seven years of research is the phenomenon of this unexpected maverick who, following centuries of conservative pontiffs, turned the Roman Catholic Church inside out. Compounding the paradox is the fact that Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was essentially a traditionalist. He loved the church's sonorous Latin, delighted in its baroque ceremonial, created his cronies cardinals, and dealt with both potentates and peasants in the manner of a simple country priest. From his youth Angelo Roncalli lived on two planes of reality. One is recorded in his book, ''Journal of a Soul,'' where he is in constant dialogue with eternity","excerpt":"the other is a beloved personality's career, climaxing with the papacy.

It's true that archeologists are excavating graves from the fort along present-day Alameda Street, and that the Pima County Courthouse is an amiable example of Spanish Colonial Revival kitsch. But in general, downtown Tucson has papered over its Hispanic origins, with a few exceptions. There are two downtown districts, both within walking distance of El Presidio Park, that bring Hispanic Tucson vividly to life. In one, directly north of the park and also called El Presidio, it's possible to walk Tucson's evolution from a Mexican to an American town in one block","excerpt":"the other is a compact neighborhood of more than 150 plastered adobe houses called the Barrio Historico.\\n\\nThe barrio occupies 13 blocks just south of the very contemporary Tucson Community Center; its main streets are Convent, Meyer and Main.

One woman (played by Estelle Parsons) is the notorious carrier of an infectious disease","excerpt":"the other is a doctor (Harriet Harris) who has been intending to inject her with a lethal overdose of germs.    Even though the scene ends at an impasse, it offers a moment of contact. For the first time, a talky docu-play has become an involving drama.  Until then, Mark St. Germain's mostly shallow, largely uncertain script mixes narration, flashback and choppy scenes in an attempt to rationally represent an irrational character.    The historical Mary Mallon, a cook who stubbornly refused to wash her hands, passed on typhoid fever, which is caused by bacteria in contaminated food and water. Although she never contracted the disease herself, she transmitted it to more than 50 people between 1900 and 1915. Three of them died, but the actual number of her victims was said to be countless.   It was after an epidemic on Long Island in 1904 that an investigation by the New York City Department of Health revealed that she had worked in every household where a typhoid casualty was found. But the elusive Mary could not be tracked down until 1907, when she was forcibly committed to the Riverside Hospital for Communicable Diseases, on North Brother Island in the East River.   The play, which takes place \\"in Mary's memory\\" and in a hospital cottage where she prepares her own food, picks up the story two years later. Maintaining that she is not guilty of a crime, Mary, \\"a walking culture tube\\" in the words of one doctor, has sued the State of New York.    During the play's six-month time span, Mary does not consent to the removal of her gall bladder, where the bacteria were supposedly stored. Yet she eventually submits to experimental treatment with germs -- by injections and pills -- in order to combat the ones inside her.    On the hospital staff, one doctor (Jack Davidson) is determinedly level-headed. He wants Mary out of there; funds and space are limited. Another (Ms. Harris) is single-mindedly full of hate. She wants Mary dead. Father McKuen (a silly part, played with painfully self-conscious purity by Michael Louden) is \\"freshly ordained\\" -- and confused.    By the end of the play, Mary is released after agreeing to give up food handling. In an epilogue, the audience is told that she violated the agreement and was once again apprehended and incarcerated, after further outbreaks of typhoid -- in New Jersey, Manhattan and Westchester. She died at Riverside after suffering a stroke in 1938.   Whether protesting her innocence, trumpeting her rights as a human being or railing against God, Miss Parsons exudes a ferocious intelligence, even when she is having tantrums, throwing dishes, spitting in the young priest's face and insisting that she does not believe in germs. Just how bright Mary was, or is supposed to be here, is guesswork. But make no mistake about it, Miss Parsons is the very picture of a brainy actress.   Mr. St. Germain's writing, however, allows the actress only gratuitous chances for emotional expansion, and then only in spurts, as if suddenly Mary must stir sympathy. At such times, Miss Parsons appears merely uncomfortable. Neither her relentless performance nor Gregory S. Hurst's rigid staging smoothly crosses over into sentiment.    What does emerge, in an almost clinical sense, is a case study of a distressed woman entrapped by inner demons, not just germs. Even when she is finally aware -- she acknowledges her guilt in causing the death of an 8-year-old -- she is helpless. Psychologically, this is valid and provocative; dramatically, it remains arbitrary and undeveloped.    Ultimately, Mr. St. Germain fails to justify the play's existence, except for its implications, which are rife on many levels. One thinks about victims who go on to create their own victims, about the ambiguity of the law when it comes to serial killers of the medical kind and, by extension, the moral and mortal consequences of innocent, or ignorant, spreaders of disease -- from tuberculosis to AIDS. If only the play were as interesting as the issues it raises.   While Mr. St. Germain may fail to arrouse forgiveness, at least his title suggests a lyricism that his blunt, perfunctory writing lacks.   In the end, it is Miss Harris's role as the doctor that is the most fulfilled, because there is less at stake. The actress, icy throughout, is moving in the showdown scene between the two women, where confrontation is tempered with compassion, and in her final monologue, where intolerance gives way to perception. It is only then that the audience feels that someone is reaching out, but unable, to forgive.   \\"Forgiving Typhoid Mary\\" at the George Street Playhouse, 9 Livingston Avenue, New Brunswick, through next Sunday.

In this Civil War novel, Kantor (at right) tells the story of a man who tries to live as a pacifist in, of all places, Gettysburg, Pa., but is inexorably drawn into the fighting. This is ''a very fine book,'' Peter Monro Jack wrote here in 1934, ''a novel that tastes and smells of war.'' The war's Washington front is examined in ABRAHAM LINCOLN: A Press Portrait, edited by Herbert Mitgang (Fordham University, $19.95). The anthology, with a new introduction, draws on more than 100 newspapers and periodicals from the United States and Europe. Lincoln was a devoted reader of newspapers at a time when they had little pretense of objectivity. The passages ''illuminate as only contemporary writings can,'' Gerald Carson said in these pages in 1971.    HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, by Stephen King. (Pocket Books, $7.99.) This sprawling work -- two novellas, two stories and an epilogue -- is permeated by Vietnam and the survivor guilt among those who did not go.

The book is ''a necessary corrective to all this economic triumphalism,'' Jeff Madrick said here in 1998, praising its ''cogent ideas.''

By contrast, if you regard his roguish mantle as a thing of beauty, you are likely to be joyously primitive. I am of the latter persuasion.   In a similar sense, if you blithely go about breaking up the shell of the lobster with your hands, fingers, thumbs and all to get at that succulent meat, you may be marked as even more primitive.

They also say that no Israeli leader can defy what they claim is an ever-growing majority opposed to any territorial concessions on the West Bank and Gaza and that any attempt toward progress would, therefore, be futile. So, the argument goes, why try?  In fact, these Americans are quite wrong. To begin with, the Israeli public is no less prepared now than ever before to accept a compromise leading to peace.

For too long, many kitchens sent hot food out on cold plates, a careless practice that is objectionable in any case, most of all with sauces with high fat content, because it makes them congeal at low temperatures.   But now that the message about warmed plates is out, staffs in many kitchens are overdoing it. Often these days, waiters present plates that are so hot they must be held through several thicknesses of napkins or even with a potholder, and customers are warned against touching those plates. There is even a certain note of pride in many waiters' voices as they say, ''Please do not touch that. It's very hot.''

Predictably, their lists are long on short-order dishes, but short on imaginative ones.

To their families, the prospect is a dismaying one of endless barbecues punctuated by pasta with the same old sauce.   There are only two ways to lighten a hard or unpleasant workload. One is to get someone else to do it","excerpt":"the other is to imbue it with such intrigue and fascination that the labor becomes secondary to the delight attending it. The chances are slim that, for the summer, the customary cook in the house can pass the meal-making job to other family members. So it is that home cooks should resort to the second workload-lightening alternative and resolve that this summer, they will cook only dishes they themselves find alluring.   By following this please-me-first policy, home cooks may please their clientele as well. Take the case of the clam chowder with spinach, basil and corn, which was sprung on a family unacquainted with the dish. The chowder did not exhaust the cook, but its preparation did amuse. At the same time, it was foreign fare to the family and thus an exotic summer delight.

It's not for sale, of course (not in any literal sense, anyway). But Coldwell Banker, feeling fanciful, calculated that if it were, it would bring nearly $64 million. (Monthly mortgage payment: $600,000.) What sent Coldwell Banker on this flight of fancy? Maybe it's that there is a White House lookalike for sale in Hillsborough, Calif. Which is which? Hint: you can have the bottom one for a mere $8.5 million.     THE PRESIDENT    This House Is Your House  Few people, it seems, actually pay capital-gains taxes when they sell their houses. The thought of writing a check for $20,000, $50,000 or whatever is so traumatic that they usually find a way around it, whether by buying a fancier house, waiting till they're 55 and taking the one-time exemption, or perhaps misremembering just how much that new deck cost (thus shrinking their reported profit). So if people avoid the tax anyway, why not scrap it? That was apparently President Clinton's reasoning when he suggested last week that profits up to $500,000 be tax-free for a couple. He also obviously figured that the idea would get him a few votes, even though it is clearly a tax break for the better off (isn't that what Democrats accuse Republicans of promising?). But just think of the American pastime that would vanish: wiggling out of that tax.     THE PRESIDENT AGAIN    That Welfare Albatross  Mr. Clinton has one albatross that liberals can't forget -- that harsh welfare bill -- and he would dearly love to shake free of it. His latest attempt: proposing to give employers who hire welfare recipients a 50 percent tax credit on the first $10,000 paid to each worker. Enterprising American businesses, though, are adept at wriggling through every loophole they can find. Some less scrupulous ones might see this as an opportunity to hire workers, keep them on the payroll till the meter hits $10,000, then dismiss them and hire others. A sad revolving door that would be.    ECONOMIC GROWTH    A Bridge Too Soon?  Bob Dole wants faster economic growth -- though not, presumably, just yet. He'd prefer to turn it into a winning campaign issue first. But the economy rather impolitely ignored Mr. Dole's political calendar, with the latest figures showing faster-than-expected growth -- a 4.8 percent annual rate -- in the latest quarter. Maybe this was fate's little gift to Bill Clinton, who at his crowning moment had to contend with that messy business with Dick Morris. But it was no gift to Wall Street: investors are more afraid of inflation than of invading aliens, and stock prices, which had bounced back nicely from their summer wanderings, went into a two-day funk. You can't please everyone.    TOBACCO WARS    The Al Gore Smoke-Out  If Al Gore ever runs for President, he can forget about tobacco contributions. There's a lot of talk about Democrats flitting from principle to principle, but in his convention speech Mr. Gore was laser-sharp in his attack on smoking. Yes, he once took tobacco money and even grew tobacco, but that seems firmly behind him. But is Philip Morris worried about all the attacks on tobacco? Apparently not, for it raised its dividend the same day -- it has now done so 32 times in 29 years. The Target store chain may be worried, though. Saying it is too costly to make sure minors don't buy cigarettes, it is simply not selling them any more. The car-racing industry is definitely worried. This sport has grown for years with tobacco sponsorship -- perhaps $250 million a year of it -- and if the new marketing rules take effect, it could be devastating.    ENDORSEMENT HEAVEN    Million-Dollar Putts  In his amazing comeback in the United States Amateur golf tournament, Tiger Woods repeatedly came within a few blades of grass of losing. So here's the question: Was he also within a few blades of grass of losing that $40 million that Nike's paying him now that he's turned pro? Talk about pressure! Talk about the turf gods smiling! But enough what-ifs. He did win. He did turn pro. And as a celebrity endorser, he's instantly up there with the big guns. Not bad for a 20-year-old who doesn't come close to being 7 feet tall, and who has nothing more strenuous to do than stroll across some absurdly well-manicured parks and swing a club occasionally.    USED CARS    Recycling (the Dark Side)  In some ways, the information age is a one-way affair. Big Marketing Brother knows all about you -- what you owe, what you buy, probably what you think. It's right there in the computer. But what if you want information on, say, that used car you're buying? How do you know if you're buying someone else's lemon? Often you don't, and you'll have a hard time finding out. Some states make dealers tell you, others don't, and some people are accusing car makers of shuffling cars around to lemon-friendly states. And there's enough for an ocean of lemonade: car makers buy back some 50,000 defective cars and trucks yearly. A reject might pass from driver to driver to driver, with each in turn forced to fight for justice (and borrow a car to get to court?). Now consumer advocates, rejecting the notion that state-by-state justice works, are pushing for uniform Federal disclosure laws. In the meantime, kick those tires.     NUCLEAR DEBRIS    Save the World? Does It Pay?  Those enlightened souls who gave us the cold war have left us quite a mess -- all sorts of stuff lying around that could be turned into devastating bombs. The stuff in the old Soviet Union may pose the biggest hazard, given the turmoil there, so the United States has set up a corporation to buy some of it before it falls into dangerous hands. A noble pursuit, surely, with the Earth's fate in the balance. But has capitalism reared its accountant's head? There are accusations that at the United States Enrichment Corporation, as it's called, thoughts have drifted to enriching itself -- that, its eye on the bottom line, it failed to buy some available uranium. If so, that's a strange way to save the planet.    EXILES    Caught in the Cuba Triangle  Is your enemy's enemy automatically your friend? America certainly thought so throughout the cold war, aiding dictator and rebel alike -- if you were anti-Communist, you qualified. Period. But where does Robert Vesco fit in this neat equation? Facing six Federal indictments on charges of everything from skimming from a mutual fund to making illegal contributions to Richard Nixon, Mr. Vesco is clearly no friend of this country. But now Cuba, also no friend of this country, has turned on him, too. After providing him a comfortable exile for years, Cuba sentenced him last week to 13 years in prison for fraud. That leaves an unbending triangle of enmity. By that original equation, we would provide Mr. Vesco a haven from our common island foe. Don't count on it.    THE T.W.A. CRASH    Enter the Bill Collector    As the search dragged on for bodies and clues and debris from the T.W.A. crash, no one discussed the cost -- though this was clearly a hugely expensive effort. Mentioning money, presumably, would have seemed tasteless; it had to be done, no matter the price. But with the bills piling high, the taboo has been broken. With items like salvage ships at $60,000 a day, the total is nearing $10 million -- by far the most expensive such operation ever -- and people are asking who's going to pay. The National Transportation Safety Board asked T.W.A. for $5 million, but the airline responded, ''We think this is a Government expenditure.''

Scenes upon which the English camera man lingered for long minutes could have been trimmed to a few feet, thereby materially speeding the story and sparing the audience the punishment of hearing the same problem threshed over and over again.Stripped of its involutions, which are many, the story is that of two brothers in love with the same woman. One of them is imprisoned for murder, although he is innocent. The other, already the favored suitor, furthers his romantic conquest by stealing his brother's musical themes and being hailed as a genius. Then the imprisoned brother is freed, but, hearing that the girl has made her choice, enters a monastery. The climactic scene is that in which the music thief goes to the monastery, admits his plagiarism and says he is willing to announce publicly that the credit for the musical compositions belongs to the brother.Whatever of dramatic import the scenario may have had is lost in the meandering treatment it has been accorded.

The organ consists of hundreds of thousands of specialized cells called electroplaques, large, flat cells with special membranes that let potassium ions pass through but keep sodium ions out. This discrimination creates a potential voltage across the membranes, with a negative charge inside the cell and a positive charge outside, each in effect canceling the other out. In this state the eel is a dud. When something shocking happens, though, the eel sends out a nerve impulse to the top side of the electroplaque, which is called the innervated side because it is ''plugged in'' to nerve endings","excerpt":"the other side, the uninnervated side, is not. The innervated side instantly lets the ions flow across the top membrane and the potential voltage vanishes. The voltage on the uninnervated side is no longer canceled out, and for a few thousandths of a second an electric current is generated into the water.

The year was 1939 and the unnamed town a lot like Leicester. Although Hitler was preparing to move on Poland and Joe had published three novels and finished a fourth, his most concentrated energies were devoted to sustaining a blissful love affair without getting married and negotiating the occupancy of a weekend cottage with an accountant friend, Tom, who also wrote fiction. One week Joe got it for trysts with Myrtle","excerpt":"the other week Tom settled in with his boyfriend, Steve. Musical weekends, lots of talk about ambivalence, guilt and the pros and cons of commitment, ''vertiginous developments'' among smart young professionals - so much for the plot of ''Scenes From Provincial Life.'' But the bright pleasures of the book depended less on what Joe did than on his quirky cast of mind and what he had to say.

The Metropolitan Opera scheduled four works for its opening week, and announced the leading tenors as follows: Placido Domingo, Neil Shicoff, Nicolai Gedda, Dano Raffanti.    As it turned out, the four openings were sung by Mr. Domingo, William Lewis and Kenneth Riegel in an improvised collaboration, Vladimir Popov - and Enrico Di Giuseppe, who stepped into the season's first ''Rigoletto'' Saturday night.   Mr. Di Giuseppe gave flavor and point to his words and acted the part of the Duke likably, but it has been several seasons since he has had the tonal freshness that should still be his in his mid-40's, and he made little of the music. He let ''Questa o quella'' go by in the usual modern, clipped, militaristic style; it was charmless. In his big aria he offered neither Verdi's cadenza nor one of his own; in ''La donna e mobile'' he added one that he could not execute with clarity.

I expected to be only mildly diverted by ''Cinderella,'' the sixth in the Matthew Hope series of macabre murder mysteries in the guise of transmogrified fairy tales. On the other hand, I expected to be wowed by ''Another Part of the City,'' a police procedural - the genre Mr. McBain virtually owns - set, unlike his venerable 87th Precinct series, in New York City rather than the mythical metropolis of Isola. But as it turned out, ''Cinderella'' is the gem, ''Another Part of the City'' the minor entertainment.

BEST WORK OF THE YEAR -- By a senior figure, hands down, it was Richard Serra's installation of eight huge sculptures at the Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain, which pushed abstract art to a new level and set a benchmark for the new century.    NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN -- Among the year's sleepers were two shows at the National Gallery in Washington: one brought three monumental Renaissance sculptures from Florence","excerpt":"the other, ''The Origins of European Printmaking,'' was a wonder cabinet of woodcuts, books and other art from the 15th century on.

SECOND WORST ABDICATION BY A MUSEUM -- The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's deal with a for-profit outfit to organize the ''Tut'' show last summer (full ticket price: $30). Naturally, the show was a hit, but at the cost of the museum's good name.    WORST ABDICATION BY A MUSEUM -- The very same Los Angeles County Museum of Art's arrangement with Eli Broad to build a gallery for his collection on museum property (city-owned, tax-free land), which he will oversee and the museum will pay to maintain. The gamble is that he donates the art someday. Meanwhile, he is also on the board of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.    DIGGING UP TROUBLE -- The growing scandal over looted antiquities from abroad, not to mention soiling American museums, fed into a particularly destructive foreign stereotype of the big, bad United States, exploiting other countries.    SADDEST MOVE OF THE YEAR -- The New York Public Library disposed of one of the city's great civic treasures, Asher B. Durand's ''Kindred Spirits,'' in a closed auction for $35 million, which the library's curators didn't even learn about until hours before the public read about it in the newspaper.    BEST MOVE OF THE YEAR -- The Museum of Modern Art, which now has all the charm of the Cherry Hill mall on Black Friday, at least managed to shift Monet's beloved ''Water Lilies'' from the second-floor lobby; there, swallowed up in the unlovely vastness, it had looked, as the critic Peter Schjeldahl so aptly phrased it, like a soiled Band-Aid. Now it resides in a busy room on the fifth floor, jutting from panels that are like giant flapping butterfly wings. For the moment this will have to do. Call it a Band-Aid for a Band-Aid.    LOCATION, LOCATION -- A tribute to the 1970's visionary Gordon Matta-Clark, at the Queens Museum and White Columns, recalled his eccentric acquisition of useless scraps of city property.    PUT OUT MORE FLAGS -- Whether you thought it was ingenious or kitsch, Christo and Jeanne-Claude's ''Gates'' in Central Park was clearly the biggest spectacle in a year full of them. Sidestepping the approval of insiders, it caused countless New Yorkers to debate the meaning of art. As promised, the gates came and went, leaving behind tourist dollars, a pristine park and the memory of a winter happening that refreshed admiration for Olmsted and Vaux's miracle.

In most cases the adjustables, known as ARM's, have caps, usually a maximum of two percentage points a year and six points over the life of the loan.

But half a century ago, the Giants' rival was the Brooklyn Dodgers, a hand-me-down from the baseball adversaries of that era. Earlier that season the Dodgers had defeated the Giants, 16-13, at Ebbets Field. But before each team's finale, the Giants' 8-2 record had clinched the Eastern Division championship.   Now, on the cold, cloudy afternoon of Dec. 7, 1941, they attracted 55,051 to the Polo Grounds where Alphonse (Tuffy) Leemans would be honored.   Before the 2 P.M. kickoff, Leemans, the Giants' single-wing tailback, received $1,500 in United States Defense bonds, a silver tray, a silver trophy and a gold wristwatch. But not long after the game began, the voice of the public-address announcer pierced the 32-degree chill.   \\"Attention, please,\\" the voice blared. \\"Here is an urgent message: will Col. William J. Donovan call Operator 19 in Washington immediately.\\"   Few wondered about the paging of Wild Bill Donovan, a World War I hero with New York City's Fighting 69th Regiment who was the chief of the new Office of Strategic Services (forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency). But anybody there with a new-fangled portable radio soon learned why, as did all those New Yorkers tuned in to their radios at home.   Not long before the kickoff, in Hawaii, Japanese planes had bombed the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor and the air base at Hickham Field. As the game at the Polo Grounds progressed, other announcements instructed military personnel to return to their posts.   \\"I remember our team chaplain, Father Benedict Dudley, coming over to me on the sideline,\\" recalled Wellington Mara, now the Giants' co-owner and then the 25-year-old son of the club's owner, Tim Mara. \\"He told me what happened, but I didn't even know where Pearl Harbor was. I don't think most people knew.\\"   When the two teams clomped up the wooden stairs to their locker rooms beyond the center-field end zone at halftime, the Dodgers were leading, 7-0.   \\"At halftime, our coach, Steve Owen, told us about Pearl Harbor,\\" remembered Jim Poole, a Giants end who now lives in Oxford, Miss. \\"He gave us such a bad account of all the bad things that happened there, it was like we didn't want to go back out on the field.\\"   In the Dodgers' locker room, their traveling secretary, Frank Scott, informed Coach Jock Sutherland of the surprise attack.   \\"Don't mention this to the players, Scotty,\\" said Sutherland, \\"They'll get upset. We've got another half to play.\\"   According to Clarence (Ace) Parker, the Dodgers' star tailback, some of their players did learn about Pearl Harbor at halftime. But it didn't deter the Dodgers, in their red-and-white jerseys, from a 21-7 victory. Their husky fullback, Clarence (Pug) Manders, scored on a 3-yard run, a 65-yard interception return as a linebacker, and a 2-yard run as the Dodgers finished second in the East with 7-4 record.   Before the game ended, Mel Hein, the Giants center and linebacker who had never missed a game in 11 seasons, was hospitalized with a broken nose and a concussion.   Hein, now 82 and living in San Clemente, Calif., recalled getting \\"caught with an elbow\\" after snapping the ball. Hein was one of five eventual Pro Football Hall of Fame members involved in that game","excerpt":"the others were Leemans, Parker and Frank (Bruiser) Kinard, the Dodgers' two-way lineman, along with Steve Owen.   Two weeks later, with Hein's nose protected by a face mask, the Giants lost the N.F.L. championship game to the Bears in Chicago, 37-9.   But the Dodgers' victory was their last hurrah. World War II depleted the team. After an 0-10 record in 1944, the franchise disbanded.   \\"That night of Dec. 7,\\" Parker said, \\"we were supposed to go to a big party with Bob Topping, the brother of Dan Topping, who owned the team. But when Bob heard about Pearl Harbor, he canceled the party. I think he had a home in Honolulu.\\"   In later years Parker, now 79 and still living in his hometown of Portsmouth, Va., scouted for the-now Phoenix Cardinals.   \\"I recommended a running back that the Cardinals drafted and later traded to the Giants,\\" he said. \\"Ottis Anderson.\\" Sports of The Times; The Day Colonel Donovan Was Paged"},{"year":"1993","title":"THEIR eyes wrapped by dark glasses, a group of people watched a television monitor in a dimly lighted room here, absorbed in a three-dimensional picture show.

Under the latter circumstances it is enchanting.   The performance under the direction of Andre Previn is brilliant.

It involves a father and his two sons and a government man Who has arrivied to learn what automation might do to this town.

Unless they choose a field of study in high demand, graduate school is not a simple solution.   Indeed, a graduate degree can lessen the chance of finding a job if one does not have substantial experience beforehand. The experience trap is such that most positions that require a master's degree also require two years of experience. Entry-level positions that would enable one to gain experience require only a bachelor's degree. Thus companies are reluctant to consider applicants with advanced degrees because they are perceived as overqualified.   Times of structural shifts in the economy highlight the deficiency of a market economy in matching employees with employers. From an economic standpoint, unemployment and underemployment reduce the productive potential of the economy. From a human perspective, a spiral of rejection can lead to destruction of self-esteem.    Young people leave college with self-confidence, believing they can help change the world. At the end of the humiliating job search they wonder if they can change a light bulb.   Other than through contacts and unethical insider information, the prime way people look for jobs is through newspaper want ads. Many newspapers have yet to enter the computer age, except for a few like your Fast Track service. It is time consuming for applicants to sift through the want ads and for businesses to go through hundreds of resumes. Computerized searches using new software would greatly increase the efficiency of matching applicants with employers.   Therefore, Congress ought to speed approval of the computerized national jobs bank contained in the Clinton Administration's job retraining plan. Putting jobs on line maximizes both economic efficiency and social justice, which cannot be said of too many things.

It is \\"Mahanagar\\" (\\"The Big City\\"), a comedy-drama of modern Indian life, and it served as a commendable finale for the not-always-commendable program of festival showings in Philharmonic Hall.In contrast to several other of the highly touted festival films, there is nothing obscure or over-stylized about this characteristic work by Mr. Ray. It is another of his beautifully fashioned and emotionally balanced contemplations of change in the thinking, the customs and the manners of the Indian middle-class.This time, his focal family—he usually centers on one family, you know, as he did with such effective continuity in his classic \\"Apu\\" trilogy—is a three-generation group of an older man, a retired school teacher, his son and the latter's small family, living in dignified poverty in a large city that is evidently New Delhi.And the content of his drama is what happens in this little group when the wife of the son, a bank clerk, goes out and gets a job. The old man, a stubborn conservative, is racked with indignation and shame at this hideous violation of custom. The son, a gentle young man, accepts, at first, the practicality of this move to help the family pocketbook, but later becomes nervous and jealous when the wife does well and he loses his job.But most interesting, touching and amusing is the subtle and all too human change that comes over the wife as she discovers her individuality and strength.One of Mr. Ray's most potent skills is his capacity to convey the delicate traits and—their particular mood and sensitivities of his characters fixations, complicated by the customs of their caste, and their powerful emotional responses that are usually subdued with bland restraints.He works this skill most deftly and absorbingly in this film. The young husband, played by Anil Chatterjee, who was the new village postmaster in the first episode of Mr. Ray's \\"Two Daughters,\\" is a tender, sensitive chap, proud but apologetic and blessed with a quiet wit. And the wife, played by Madhabi Mukherjee, is beautiful, with, a soft humility, yet a forceful, vibrant spirit that suggests the new woman in India.Haren Chatterjee as the grumbling father is irritating but clearly pitiable, reflecting the sad condition of the poorly paid schoolteacher class, and Haradhan Banerjee is hearty and efficient as a new mercantile executive.Mr. Ray's conclusion for his drama runs to the Hollywood cliché and is not consistent with the honesty and clarity of the better part of it. But his film, on the whole, is so poignant, so good-humored, sad and serene","excerpt":"the pace is so meaningfully languid, the atmosphere so true, that it leaves one, again, with the feeling of having spent a time in heartwarming emotional contact with a family in India.This film will be released in this country within a few months by Edward Harrison.

Frank Seminara (1-2) picked up his first major league victory in his fourth big league start, going six innings before being ejected for throwing a pitch that hit Robby Thompson opening the seventh inning.   The benches emptied for a second time, but only words were exchanged and the game proceeded after Mike Maddux replaced Seminara, who allowed five hits and four runs in helping send the Giants to their sixth straight loss.   McGriff had stepped in against Wilson after Sheffield hit his first career slam in the fourth to give the Padres an 8-0 lead. Wilson's first pitch hit McGriff in his right leg, and McGriff dropped his bat and charged the mound. Wilson threw his glove at McGriff, and the two tumbled to the ground.   In an instant, the benches cleared and players and coaches from the two sides mixed it up in an all-out fight. It took about 15 minutes for the umpires to restore order and resume play.   At one point, the fight seemed to be dying down. But as Wilson walked away from the mound toward the dugout, McGriff went over to him and the two exchanged punches again. Other players and coaches rejoined the melee before calm was restored.   Both Wilson and McGriff were ejected. Wilson (5-6), whose face appeared red and puffy as he left the game, was pounded for eight hits in three and two-third innings.

Braggs hit the first pitch from reliever Mike Stanton (1-4) over the left-field fence after Hal Morris walked with one out. It was Braggs's first home run of the year.   Scott Bankhead (8-1) picked up the victory with two and one-third innings of relief in the opener of the four-game series between two of baseball's hottest teams. Norm Charlton picked up his 16th save.   It was Cincinnati's seventh victory in a row and 19th in 23 games.

Nabholz (5-5) was working on a two-hitter when he walked the bases full with one out in the sixth, prompting Manager Felipe Alou to bring on Fassero. Fassero promptly got Don Slaught, who was 3 for 4 and has 10 hits in his last 15 at-bats, to ground into an inning-ending double play. Fassero pitched three and two-third innings of one-hit relief for his first save.

Chuck McElroy relieved and gave up the two-out, game-winning double to Dykstra on a 3-2 pitch. Tigers 14, Blue Jays 10    TORONTO (AP) -- Travis Fryman drove in a career-high five runs with a double and a triple, and Cecil Fielder broke a 10-10 tie in the eighth inning with a sacrifice fly as Detroit beat Toronto in a game that lasted 4 hours 1 minute.   Detroit chased Blue Jays starter Dave Stieb with six runs in the second. Stieb lasted only one and two-third innings, his shortest start of the season, and allowed six runs on four hits while walking three and striking out one.

The Mariners were the only major league team that had not played an extra-inning game this season. Brewers 4, Indians 1    MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Bill Wegman pitched the first three-hitter of his career as Milwaukee defeated Cleveland. Wegman (7-5), whose previous best effort was a four-hitter in 1986, was perfect through four innings before Albert Belle hit his 15th homer on Wegman's first pitch of the fifth. Cleveland's only other hits were an infield single by Sandy Alomar Jr. in the sixth and a single by Belle in the seventh.

By relying on a pager for incoming messages, cellular-phone owners can avoid interruptions from unwanted calls, which they would have to pay for if answered. They also do not need to leave the phone on to get calls, saving their batteries. \\"There are many people who have their pagers Velcroed to their phone,\\" said Herschel Shosteck, a cellular phone industry consultant in Silver Spring, Md. Universal Cellular hopes to eliminate the need for Velcro by combining the two devices into one unit that weighs less than a pound.

There is no arguing with the legions of buffs who revere Mr. Charles as a titan of the rhythm and blues section of popular music. But the sound he and his groups generates tends to drown out the simple, but too obvious drama with which they are involved.As the film's Ray Charles, who befriends and guides a recently blinded British boy and his widowed young mother through their travails, he is refreshingly natural and subdued.

They call it bikutsi rock, and it's one more gift that renewed regionalism has brought to the world's music. In recent decades, Cameroon, like other parts of French-speaking Africa, has been blanketed with one of Africa's most popular styles, the Zairean pop called soukous, which has amalgamated in Paris with its Antillean cousin, zouk. Cameroon's own pop, makossa, also looks to an international market. When the band got started in 1986, the Tetes Brulees (roughly translated as the Hot Heads) wanted something with roots closer to home, and were drawn to music from the rain forests of western Cameroon, where the Beti tribe has music called bikutsi.

But it was largely the music-loving Vienna that created the waltz, the operetta, that they drew from. Not so Willi Forst, who wrote and directed the Tobis-Sascha film \\"Maskerade,\\" which just had its première at the Gloria Palast. He took the story from life, from a big society scandal that actually happened in Vienna around 1900.A fashionable painter of women gets the wife of a well-known surgeon, whom he meets at the carnival ball, to sit for him. Accidentally, the painting is used for a magazine cover, and, as the masked model is scantily clothed, a scandal is imminent. For the clothing she wears had been worn at the ball by the surgeon's sister. She must be the model, then. Her fiancé demands from the painter the model's name. But the random one that he gives draws into this mêlée an inexperienced young girl, companion to an elderly countess. Between her and the painter deep interest springs up. But the jealousy of another woman almost brings tragedy","excerpt":"the painter is shot at but not killed. He will recover. It is in this finish that one wishes Forst might have deviated from actual history.But there remains little else for critical disapproval. For the popular leading man, Willi Forst, has with one leap firmly ensconced himself on the other side of the camera and achieved one of the most beautiful and effective films of the year. He has conjured up the well-bred affability of the urbane Viennese of that period, his grace and charm, with delicacy and unusual re-creative skill. It is the romantic pyschology of Arthur Schnitzler, of Herrmann Bahr, put into a fascinating screen life. Adolf Wohlbrück as the handsome painter might have been somewhat less reticent. But the artlessness of Peter Petersen as the surgeon, and, above all, the natural directness and spontaneity of Paula Wessely as the plain companion, deserve a star in the Baedeker of film acting. And both these actors are new to the screen. Berlin saw Paula Wessely two Winters ago on the stage in a vivid performance of Hauptmann's \\"Rose Bernd,\\" after which she returned to her native Vienna, from where reports of uncontested stardom came. That Willi Forst chose her for his film showed courage. For hers is not a film face. She has one great asset—she can act. It only needed this one picture to place her at the top. Berlin film enthusiasts have their sensation.A film without a cast and story, a silent film with hardly an explanatory title, is Wilfried Basse's \\"Germany Between Yesterday and Today.\\" With a Journalistic eye for the unusual contrasts that make up this strange land where the medieval and modern lie so close to each other, Basse set out with an amateur camera equipment in his Ford determined to draw into his lens this Germany of past and present: the peasant who still furrows his ground with the plow of his forefathers; the oxcart that rumbles stodgily over the cobblestones of a picturesquely gabled town with its iron-wrought signboards; the woman baking her daily bread by the wayside in the ashes of a clay oven; the rope spinner at work beside the brook, walking backward like a crab; the North German towns so different in their severe architecture of sixteenth-century brick Gothic from the graceful lines of the South German baroque; the small university town with its traditional pomp of costumed processions; the tailor sitting cross-legged on his table; the glass-blower, street musician, tinker.And then the familiar scenes of today: the beer garden, Turnverein, the industrial centres, the metropolis, its supply, its work, its rest. At all this Herr Basse has tilted his camera at a most personal angle. He sees the Fatherland with a satirical glint in his critical eye. His actors knew nothing of the parts they were playing. No scene was set. For eight months he wandered and watched a Germany intent on its work, unconsciously dramatic, inadvertently humorous.

The scene in the gallery's big front room is dramatic: four impeccably made, perfectly lined up billiard tables -- all green felt, gleaming mahogany and shiny balls (three to each pocketless surface, as the game dictates). The unusual flared legs of these tables have been copied from a famous Surrealist painting by Man Ray.    After the men's club, the men's room: in the second gallery are three bronze renditions of Marcel Duchamp's urinal. The show's finale is a room of monochrome paintings on wood whose colors (blue, orange, pink, gold) have been copied exactly from the monochrome canvases of the French postwar artist Yves Klein. The final point is not hard to miss: painting in particular, and traditional modernism in general, may be the most exclusive male ritual of all.    One problem here is conspicuous consumption in the line of artistic duty, but Ms. Levine is not the first artist to exhibit work that makes you wonder how much it cost to fabricate.

A hefty five-foot-long Gothic Revival table from 1805 is one of the most important offerings at the auction of English furniture to be held on Feb. 2 at Christie's in Manhattan.    Probably designed by the architect James Wyatt for a neo-Gothic library that was added about 1805 to a Jacobean house in West Dean Park, Chichester, in West Sussex, the oak table on cluster column legs is embellished with quatrefoils and Gothic arches. Its green marble top is framed with pierced brass trim. The presale estimate is $50,000 to $70,000.   Asked about the estimate, which was lower than recent prices on comparable Gothic Revival furniture at New York galleries, William J. Iselin, who heads European furniture sales at Christie's in New York, said: \\"The current owner paid $66,000 for this table when we auctioned it in New York in 1986. Given the general sentiment against hiking an estimate over a price paid recently, we kept the estimate close to what he paid. It should be a good test of the market for this style of furniture.\\"  George III Armchairs     At a Sotheby's sale of English furniture to be held at 2 P.M. on Jan. 26 in Manhattan, a pair of George III armchairs from about 1755 is the most important offering. Elaborately carved with scrolls, foliage and ribbons and finished in pale blue paint and gilding, the chairs are from the estate of Henry Ford 2d. The presale estimate is $200,000 to $250,000.    George Read, an English-furniture specialist at Sotheby's, said, \\"Good big pairs of chairs have been bringing around $200,000.\\" An example he mentioned was a George II pair of walnut chairs that sold for $220,000 in 1988.   \\"The other ones are more commercial: less ornate and the type of chairs you can put anywhere,\\" Mr. Read said. \\"I think it's going to be a serious collector who will be interested in these chairs.\\" Old Masters     The Old Masters auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's last week in Manhattan attracted art dealers, collectors and celebrity-conscious auctiongoers. Those who came to view art collected by the rich and famous headed for Christie's to see the Old Master collection formed by Imelda and Ferdinand E. Marcos, when Mr. Marcos was President of the Philippines. When these paintings were auctioned last Friday morning, all 99 were sold for a total of $15.4 million, surpassing Christie's most optimistic expectations of $10 million at most.    Among the most important paintings was Raphael's \\"St. Catherine of Alexandria,\\" which was bought for $1.65 million by the Italian Government to hang at the Uffizi in Florence. El Greco's \\"Coronation of the Virgin\\" brought $2.1 million in a sale to Stanley Moss, a New York City dealer in Old Master works.   The Marcos sale was the most successful of these auctions, all of which fared better at the New York houses than did the Impressionist, modern and postwar art sales in November.    \\"Unlike Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, the Old Master field never exploded,\\" said Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in the United States. \\"It has always been very steady.\\"   At Christie's second sale last Friday afternoon, Old Master paintings from different owners were auctioned. In that sale, 68 of the 84 offerings were sold for a total of $11.9 million, just above the house estimate of $7.9 million to $11.4 million. All the 10 most important works were sold, and 9 of these realized prices surpassing Christie's expectations.    Did the weak dollar contribute to the success of this sale?    \\"The Italian and European presence at the sale was a bit stronger than usual because of the dollar,\\" Ian Kennedy, who heads Christie's Old Masters sales, said. \\"They bought many works.\\"    The painting that brought the highest price was Pieter Bruegel the Younger's \\"Wedding Dance,\\" from about 1600, selling for $1.05 million. The presale estimate was $400,000 to $600,000. A pair of mid-18th-century paintings by Giuseppe Bonito, \\"The Musical Party\\" and \\"The Poet,\\" was expected to bring at most $600,000","excerpt":"the pair sold for $748,000.    At Sotheby's, there were major disappointments at its Old Masters sale on Jan. 10. At that sale, only 66 of the 107 offerings were sold for a total of $9.8 million, against an estimate of $13.8 million to $19.5 million. One of the biggest problems for the auction house was the group of eight Old Master paintings owned by Saul P. Steinberg, the New York financier. Six of the paintings failed to sell.   Asked why, George Wachter, who heads Old Master sales at Sotheby's in New York, said this week in a telephone interview from Tampa, Fla., that all were purchased recently. \\"All the Steinberg paintings were bought within the last 10 years from dealers, at prices close to the low estimates that we published,\\" Mr. Wachter said.   The Steinberg paintings were offered with some of the sale's highest presale estimates. Those that did not sell included works by Lucas Cranach the Elder, Hendrick Gerritsz Pot, Theodor Rombouts, Karel Dujardin, Jan van Goyen and Rubens.

Part of this theatre was at one time Roger Wolfe Kahn's Le Perroquet Club de Paris. It has since been enlarged, and the entrance instead of being on Fifty-sixth Street is now on Fifty-seventh.This elegant small theatre can boast of almost as much lobby as it has auditorium. Its capacity is 409 silver and black seats and the other decorations are also most modern. It believes in satisfying people who come there, for if they are not partial to the screen offerings they can go into one of the small rooms giving off the lobby and there engage in dancing, a game of bridge, a mah-jong contest or even ping-pong. In addition there are cigarettes and coffee. This theatre's carpets are thick, soft and new and the place has quite a Parisian air.Those who went there last night gathered in the game rooms and in the lobby until past 9 o'clock, when that first old feature picture, \\"Queen Elizabeth,\\" with Sarah Bernhardt, was screened after a nonsensicality in which Maurice Cass officiated as the \\"Voice of Bernard Shaw,\\" while Shaw was perceived on the screen in an old film. But the main offering is the Soviet film, \\"Ten Days That Shook the World,\\" produced by S. M. Eisenstein, director of \\"Potemkin.\\"And so to the film. It is clever, but a bore. It is kaleidoscopic, so much so that when months seem to have passed since one saw a man with a flag of truce, you find he is still sitting in the same position awaiting an answer. Mr. Eisenstein is too fond of picking out statues and then giving you the mental activities of a crude-visaged fighting man. He has the wonderful advantage of being able to use hordes of people","excerpt":"the palaces of Petrograd, Moscow or other cities. He need have no fear of the cost. In fact it may be that he has such an abundance of material that he needs almost us much time to picture that with which he is dealing as the events took. He gives one day and it seems a week, even though it may not be actually more than ten minutes.His masters, the Soviet, being ever wishful of seeing the Bolsheviks get their due in a picture, Mr. Eisenstein does not neglect to show the fight of Right against the Mailed Fist even in the clash with Kerensky. He makes Kerensky a frightfully nervous individual. In fact, he looks more nervous than ill. Mr. Eisenstein gives far too many details in the sweep of events, for in addition to covering an enormous amount of detail he thinks up cinematic angles that add to the mêlée. It comes to one, therefore, like a superb nightmare. A little of it would be wonderfully interesting, a little more becomes quite enough. But, as it is shown, there is a great deal too much.Yet it must be admitted that in the course of the wanderings from queer-looking faces, fixed eyes, women in uniforms, brass heads on great gates, statues with and without harps, one is every now and again confronted with a flash that is fired with imagination, and then on other occasions a bit of photography that is as soft and seductive as a Turner study.There is crammed into this film enough for half a dozen productions, but most of the episodes are unfinished. Mr. Eisenstein revels in showing the pillaging of Bolshevik troops as they found their hobnailed boots for the first time on the waxed floors of a palace. He gives some striking scenes in a wine cellar, first showing the joy of a woman and some men at finding the bottles, and later the soldiers battering the bottles with the butts of their rifles until they are knee deep in Burgundy, claret, champagne, sauterne and, mayhap, brandy. The search of the soldiers reveals a photograph of the late Czar, forks, spoons—a heap of silverware.A few crates of St. George's Crosses come in for rough treatment, as they are scattered about a room. And then there is a title setting forth:\\"And this is what we fought for.\\"Some of the action is a little muddled, but where Eisenstein does masterful work is in those scenes with hundreds and hundreds of people. It really seems as if they were part of the Revolution, as if the scenes belonged to a news reel. The faces look scared and others are grim. There are \\"shots\\" looking down upon the Winter Palace that are remarkable in their pace. Eisenstein appears to have a General at his elbow to give orders that the men know must be obeyed.This film was originally released abroad under the title of \\"October.\\" THE SCREEN; New Little Cinema Opens."},{"year":"1959","title":"Two conspicuous symbols of government in the West German capital of Bonn are the Villa Hammerschmidt and the Palais Schaumburg.

Its ancestry can be traced back to the Greek phantazein, \\"to make visible, present to the mind,\\" which is derived from phaos, the Greek word for light, and akin to the Sanskrit bhati, \\"it shines.\\" Sadly, most books marketed today under the label of fantasy do a disservice to this proud etymology. Instead of fresh wonders made visible, fantasy as a commercial genre has come to mean endlessly recycled adventures of sword-wielding heroes and spell-casting wizards, recounted in a pseudopoetic prose as dreary and predictable as the characters and settings. This makes the achievement of Peter S. Beagle in THE INNKEEPER'S SONG (Roc/Penguin, $20) all the more remarkable. In his capable hands even the most timeworn material shines again.   Mr. Beagle, whose 1968 novel, \\"The Last Unicorn,\\" is something of a classic in the field, sets his story of love and loss in familiar territory -- a preindustrial world in which the levers of power are manipulated, for good or ill, by people known as wizards or magicians.

Unfortunately, they permitted the Plaza's owner, Rose Associates, to be portrayed as part of the solution instead of as part of the problem.   In 1989, Rose joined with the city and the community in agreeing to rehabilitate the Plaza -- saying, in writing, that it would \\"pay the full cost of extensive rehabilitation of the plaza\\" in exchange for permission to close it at night. A design was prepared, and then Rose announced its intention to pass along the burden of the plaza's maintenance and rehabilitation through a condominium conversion plan.    If this wasn't bold enough, Rose Associates has now announced that it would like government and other property owners to share in the rehabilitation cost of the Sheffield Plaza. These parties received no part of the original zoning bonus which resulted in a building whose residential portion is now estimated by Rose Associates to be worth $162 million.    We vehemently disagree with the statement attributed to Rose stating that Rose \\"balked at a city requirement that any redesign . . . be submitted to lengthy review.\\" The Uniform Land Use Review Process was agreed to by    all    parties to the 1989 agreement.    Lastly, if the plaza was properly cleaned up every day, as Rose asserted, the issue would not have united so many of us. We believe that Rose should stand by its commitment. We stand ready to work with Rose and our elected officials to implement the agreement.

By gathering together a band of zanies on an appropriately festive occasion, Mr. Tacchella can tickle his audiences with a disjointed, determinedly fluffy-headed brand of comedy. He can also, by allocating one or two piquant remarks to each character and never allowing anyone to conduct a sustained conversation, create the impression that this is merriment with a message.Mr. Tacchella's messages, upon close inspection, don't amount to much: He offers endless variations on the notions that people must do what makes them happiest, that they don't always live up to their dreams and that they must be forgiven their foibles. But the thematic banality of his films in no way compromises Mr. Tacchella's most useful talent, which is for sleight-of-hand. In \\"Blue Country,\\" he once again manages to suggest that the lightweight mood of his films bespeaks an inner seriousness. Mr. Tacchella's peculiarly circular gift is for lending ephemeralness and insubstantiality the appearance of virtues.In \\"Blue Country,\\" the obligatory zanies meet in a rural setting, a breath-takingly beautiful French valley populated by a happy mixture of peasants and ex-Parisians. The peasants have more children than they can keep track of, and long for the luxuries of city living","excerpt":"the Parisians like to bake bread, speak knowingly of their newly acquired goats and talk of the landscape in terms of Corot or Cézanne (\\"No wonder peasants don't buy paintings!\\" one unreconstructed bourgeoise exclaims).The valley's populace meets gaily and often for communal dinners so appetizing that viewers headed for the 68th Street Playhouse, where the film has opened, would be well advised to arm themselves with bread and paté. At least half of \\"Blue Country's\\" appeal is based on its sheer pastoral pleasantness, and on the gusto with which its principals indulge their appetites.As in \\"Cousin, Cousine,\\" there is a romantic subplot that seems strangely tangential to the film's predominant hustle and bustle. Louise (Brigitte Fossey), an ex-Parisian, meets Mathias (Jacques Serres), a country bachelor, and both are so fiercely independent that they vow not to fall in love. Fall in love they do, though, very picturesquely, and each makes a few sacrifices to accommodate the other. But they never move in together, even after 10 years of courtship, which is the film's rather lumbering way of reminding us that they have retained that fierce independence.Here, as before, Mr. Tacchella seems unable to integrate the romance with all the brouhaha, and it's the romance that suffers. Miss Fossey is unflaggingly radiant and Mr. Series attractively stalwart, yet the director seems unaccountably uneasy when his screenplay leaves him alone with these two very agreeable lovers.\\"Blue Country\\" is less structurally coherent than \\"Cousin, Cousine,\\" and its delightful eccentrics seem a little more contrived in their delightfulness. Both films are likely to appeal to the same audience, though—to viewers who ascribe a certain Gallic cachet to films with the consistency of cotton candy, and who approach with utter fearlessness the prospect of being charmed to death.

French Savoy was ceded to France by the Italian region of Piedmont in 1860. Tucked away between the celebrated Olympic ski resorts of the French Savoie such as Val d'Isere and Tignes to the west and Italy's popular Gran Paradiso national park to the east, it is often overlooked, attracting the few hikers and cross-country skiers in the winter who know its quiet old villages, profusion of Alpine wildflowers, pure air and good trails.

Few choreographers today are as versatile as Michel Fokine, Leonide Massine, Bronislava Nijinska or George Balanchine. While those dance pioneers were geniuses, and genius cannot be wished into existence, we are not without talented ballet makers today. However, too many choreographers are stuck in ruts. For instance, there's an inordinate emphasis nowadays upon music as choreography's primary source. Of course, music can inspire. But ballet-making involves more than setting steps to concertos or symphonies. A ballet must have a distinctive theatrical personality apart from its accompaniment.

His low-key exhibition is of 10 12-inch dolls, all displayed in one case. His detailed dolls are gentle reminders of how elaborate, how beautifully lush and ornamental the Sioux and Crow tribal dress could be. He says it takes him, working in his home on a Sioux reservation in South Dakota, two to five weeks to make one doll. As he grew up, he developed his own style of doll making, using extremely small beads, tanned buckskin and other animal skins, feathers for miniature fans and dance bustles on the female dolls. One doll in 19th-century dress is decorated with dentalium seashells and heavily beaded leggings and moccasins. Two other dolls have bushy mink puffs at the ends of their braids","excerpt":"the parts in their hair are painted vermillion. As a touch of whimsy, he created his idea of a Sioux calvary officer's jacket, a lovely juxtaposition of feathers with a navy blue military officer's coat. In the long-ago past, he said, the Sioux would often have military jackets on hand as spoils of war, and they would wear them at powwows with feathers in the breast pockets or on the lapels.

Bernstein was browsing through the racks of an East Side greeting card store. Passing the In Sympathy-Bereavement selections she spotted a colorful cutout of Snoopy, which seemed a bit out of place considering the category. What's more, Snoopy was carrying a sign reading, \\"Goodbye from all of us, but if you gotta go, you gotta go.\\"   Shaking her head, Ms. Bernstein pondered the macabre state of humor today. Just then a salesclerk passed by. He reached out for the Snoopy card. \\"Oh dear,\\" he said. \\"This should be in the On Your Retirement display.\\" Dear Diary:   Some time ago on East 86th Street I was on my way home from Bloomingdale's, wearing at just the right angle -- straight over the eyes -- the black velvet jockey cap I had just bought at the hat counter. As I bounced along, feeling quite pleased with myself, two young women passed, and as they glanced in my direction I heard one say, \\"She thinks she's cool, but she ain't.\\" I realized they were talking about me and I laughed.   When I got home I headed straight for a mirror. I looked at myself and knew instantly that they were right. I took off that hat and never wore it again. If it hadn't been for those sensible young women I probably would have paraded all over New York in that stupid hat. -- HELEN MAGEE Dear Diary:   After living in Manhattan for 10 years, my family and I moved to Portland, Ore. I haven't been back to New York for two and a half years; for the past eight months I've been having a dream. This is how it goes.   I'm in New York; I'm seeing lots of friends. Suddenly it's time to leave and I realize I haven't been to Zabar's. I try, but I'm unable to get there. I get stuck in traffic, sometimes crosstown, sometimes uptown, sometimes downtown. One time I come close. I get off a stalled bus and start running up Columbus. I make it to the Silver Palate, but before I can get to Zabar's I wake up.   I recently had a baby: the dream started during my pregnancy. It's not unusual, of course, for pregnant women to get cravings for food. But a craving for a whole store?   Portland is a lovely town, but perhaps I've been there too long. -- JANE UNGER   The place is the Major Deegan Expressway. The players: Lois Weiss and her 8-year-old daughter, Bonnie, heading into Manhattan from Scarsdale for a dental appointment. The action: Mrs. Weiss spots the license plate on the car ahead. It says FLOSSDDS. Our players smile. And they smile again, more broadly, when they notice that the driver of FLOSSDDS has one hand on the wheel. With the other, he is happily picking his teeth.     The scene is a pre-auction exhibit at Sotheby's, where Rosalie Tokar of Floral Park, Queens, overhears two women of uncertain age discussing an acquaintance.   First woman to second woman: \\"When she got married she was a Modigliani. Now she's a Renoir.\\"  Dear Diary:   There are advantages to living in the city and working in New Jersey, the most satisfying being the reverse commute. What joy to drive unimpeded up the Henry Hudson Parkway each morning while the Jersey commuters clog the southbound lanes, and the other way round in the evening!   In winter and early spring, there is additional pleasure to be found long about 6 P.M. as you swing off the George Washington Bridge and turn south. The air is crisp and clear -- unlike the air in summer, when the skies turn heavy and gray -- and the sunset over the Palisades is stunning.   Recently there has been an additional pleasure. Halfway down the highway, high in the still-bare trees lining the river, one can see the hunched silhouettes of red-tailed hawks, outlined against the dusky sky.   I first spotted a few of them three years ago. This winter they have been more visible than ever.  Perhaps they have got used to noise and traffic. Wildlife is common enough in the suburbs. But birds of prey along the Henry Hudson Parkway? -- DAVID LILLY   Mark N. Klein, striding along lower Broadway on a touched-with-spring morning, spots a man wearing a very white sweatshirt. The fellow is holding a paper cup. Mr. Klein, determined to share his cheer with others, reaches into his pocket, pulls out a quarter and walks over to the man.   The instant Mr. Klein tosses coin in cup, he realizes his mistake. There is coffee in the cup. A lot of it. The coin causes the liquid to splash-stain the front of the no-longer-white sweatshirt.   Mr. Klein mumbles an embarrassed apology. The man smiles and says not to worry. Grateful for the man's sense of humor, Mr. Klein walks away quickly, though with less bounce than before.

But Luciano Berio has chosen a peculiar relationship to tradition, as could be heard on Friday night, when Dennis Russell Davies led the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in an impressively played concert devoted to Mr. Berio's music. The concert, which was repeated on Saturday night, suggested how much Mr. Berio's avant-garde stance, during more than three decades of composition, has involved wrestling with the past, both in rejecting it and in absorbing it.    Often, the past is something definitely to avoid. Mr. Berio was attracted to the experimental music of the 1950's and was a pioneer of electronic music. Then he produced works like \\"Sinfonia,\\" whose subject was the countercultural politics of the 1960s. He pushed solo instruments to their limits in a series of numbered works, each titled \\"Sequenza,\\" and has combined rigorous musical construction with dramatic textual settings. Mr. Berio, who has taught at Juilliard and has been an influential participant in Ircam, Pierre Boulez's research institute for new music in Paris, has written music that is aggressive, distinctive and difficult to like. He has often gone out of his way to write in a perpetual present rather than a traditional past, his eyes focused on \\"advanced\\" technique.

(The portion of the Soviet Union from the border eastward almost to Leningrad, and stretching northward as well, once known as Karelia, is now called the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.) Perhaps because of this mixed heritage and South Karelia's history as a trading center between east and west, its cooking is so rich with varying influences.

''At the time of the filing we recogized it as a pioneering patent,'' said Harry Knutson, the Tokyo representative of Allied, which is based in Morristown, N.J.    What Allied did not foresee was how difficult it would be to get the patent - its application was opposed by Japanese companies and it was bogged down in procedural delays for 10 years.   Nor was Allied's experience unique. The growing high-technology rivalry between the United States and Japan is being fought not only in the laboratory and factory, but also in the patent office.

Frustration, fear and anger chase one another in the continuous downward spiral.    By the time intelligent conversation has given way to singsong gibberish and limbs have forgotten their function, the opportunity to opt out is long since past. It is only at the onset of the disease that the victim still retains some control over her fate.    Many will choose life for as long as it lasts, whatever the conditions may be. Others may wish to exit before their competence is gone and their image in the memories of others is diminished. This decision belongs to the patient, not the doctor.

In this picture, however, the producers dodge the dangerous ground of real countries and seek refuge in imaginary kingdoms. The cycle of events may not be as neatly sketched as it was done on the stage, but, as the story has not been stripped of the essentials, it affords plenty of laughter.The idea of an Ambassador scolding his military attaché, Baron Valmi, for paying too much attention to his hobby of miniature painting and not enough to the women of the court to which he is assigned possesses possibilities. But the interest is heightened by the knowledge that the supposed student of art is only keeping away from the fair sex because this same Ambassador's wife is in love with him and she is furiously jealous. To complicate matters, Baron Valmi is actually in love with a girl named Greta, and woe betide him if Heléne, as the Ambassador's wife is known, hears of this infatuation!The Ambassador is anxious to have a treaty signed and he thinks that the War Minister's young wife could easily influence her husband in its favor. Valmi is therefore commanded by his chief to engage in a flirtation with Mona, the War Minister's wife, and while this alluring woman is somewhat surprised at the sudden interest betrayed in her by Valmi, soon she becomes quite charmed with the clandestine affair.During one episode the Ambassador visits the military attaché, and Heléne is rushed into another room. On another occasion Heléne telephones Valmi when her husband is talking over diplomatic affaires du coeur with his military attaché. There are scenes when Heléne visits Valmi and Mona is concealed in an adjoining room and the only way the military attaché can get rid of the jealous Heléne is by saying that her husband is in the other room. Even the War Minister, who declares that he always has a premonition when something is wrong, comes to see Valmi, little suspecting that his own wife is behind the door in front of him.Needless to say this boudoir diplomat has a much perturbed existence and it is with no misgivings that he is finally sent as Minister to Peru, with the flaxen-haired Greta as his bride.Ian Keith does moderately well as Valmi, Mary Duncan makes the most of the War Minister's bewitching wife. Betty Compson is quite good as the tempestuous Heléne. Jeanette Loff is pretty. Lawrence Grant and Lionel Belmore contribute to the fun as trusting husbands. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Patriot.

The five-member dance company, founded in 1986 by Brenda Bufalino, blends rapid-fire virtuosity and a wonderfully easygoing amiability. Ms. Bufalino is a tap master known for a big, brassy style that has been compared to the singing of Ethel Merman. Overall, the dancers' style is downward, with feet boring into the floor as they tap out complex beats and rhythmic juxtapositions, and with the dancers' torsos loosely poised above them. This was rigorously choreographed rather than improvised tap, but the mood was wittily playful, and the shifting floor patterns of the dances provided enough visual detail to offer a larger context for those dancing feet.

But if all the balletomanes knew what another first-nighter in their midst knows, they'd be marveling that some of the dancers were dancing at all. For it is to this man, an orthopedic surgeon named William G. Hamilton, that dancers from the New York City Ballet, the American Ballet Theater and many other companies go with their potentially career-ending injuries. He has ministered to the soles of Baryshnikov, Martins and Farrell, among hundreds of others.          Dancers who face acute and chronic injuries, from bad landings to plain overuse, learn to approach their bodies' capabilities with savvy. \\"At any time,  10 to 15 percent of a dance company is out with an injury,\\" says Hamilton, who can distinguish between companies by the injuries they keep. \\"There's a different pattern of injury for each, related to the different choreography, touring schedules, dancing on the Met stage versus the State Theater's and many  other factors.\\"    Sunday April 28, 1996: ON THEIR TOES","excerpt":"The Patter of Aching Feet"},{"year":"1955","title":"pors and illus The Political Pattern of '56 Shapes Up","excerpt":"The Pattern of '56 Shapes Up"},{"year":"1950","title":"Baldwin on air activity JETS' ARCTIC WOES LARGELY SOLVED","excerpt":"The Pattern of Ground Support in Yukon Exercise Follows Closely That Set by War Funnels Back Requests Third Link in Chain"},{"year":"1937","title":"Por, with rev of book, The Incredible Messiah, by R A Parker The Deifying of Father Divine","excerpt":"The Pattern of His Apotheosis Is More Significant Than the Little Man Who Is Its Center, in Robert Allerton Parker's Study THE INCREDIBLE MESSIAH: THE DEIFICATION OF FATHER DIVINE.

The antics of the Paycock are forgotten in the problems of Juno and the forgetfulness is most abrupt. By its failure to blend the two poles of drama the film resolves itself into virtually two plays.The film version of the Abbey Theatre's success has followed the model rather faithfully. It is a talking picture, of course, but the producers—\\"British International\\"—have not allowed themselves to be led into playing with the young device. When a scene is more dramatic silent they refrain from adding the music of a theme song. On the other hand, the recording has not been done too well. Sections of the dialogue were lost to a Saturday audience through something faulty in the synchronization.The two parts of Juno suggest themselves by the two main characters. In the Paycock Mr. O'Casey, and after him Alfred Hitchcock, the director, has built up an amusing figure. Like the bird from which the name is drawn, the Paycock is a professional strutter. He doesn't work, but he likes whisky and stories and philosophy. The author has made the most of that particular trinity. The character is finely done and it is well acted","excerpt":"the Paycock amiably alibis himself through the picture's first sections.Then comes the tragedy—built upon the comedy and without much intermediate foundation. It concerns Juno and her son and daughter, and there is the machine-gun background of the recent Irish history when the Free Staters and the Die Hards fought one another after fighting together. While troubles are descending on the head of Juno, the previous antics of her husband are forgotten. And just as the first part of the picture is good comedy so is the latter good tragedy. But adding the two together has made a film that seems quite a little too long, and one rather vague.Most of the acting in \\"Juno and the Paycock\\" is good. One or two figures appear a little prone to act too much, just as Mr. O'Casey has been prone to overwrite and over-dramatize. Both Edward Chapman as Captain Boyle (the Paycock) and Sara Allgood as Mrs. Boyle (Juno) do well with rôles that must by the nature of things be extremely difficult. Sidney Morgan as Joxer Daly is also good in the part of the Paycock's best friend. And Maire O'Neil—the Mrs. Madigan of the saloon and tenement—pictures her part excellently.Shortly after the story of Juno opens, the Paycock is told a legacy has been left him. He and the family promptly begin putting on such airs as buying new furniture and a gramophone. The Paycock even goes so far as to dismiss Joxer Daly from his sight. Before the legacy became known, Joxer was his best friend; they haunted saloons together and dodged work most successfully. But with the new state, the friends of the past had to go.After various sunny interludes, trouble begins piling up. The legacy turns out to be non-existent, and Juno's daughter confesses that she has been too friendly with the young lawyer who drew up the will. Then the son, Johnny Boyle—already armless from the wars—is accused of being an informer, and is taken out and shot. The last scene of all shows Juno leaving her home, bare rooms from which the furniture had all been removed for the payment of debts. THE SCREEN; A Play of Ireland.

Hendrik Willem Van Loon's \\"The Fight for Peace\\" has looked for its beauties among the expurgated clips of the newsreels, shots too bloody for casual presentation to an unprepared audience. With these for its close-ups, with a concise marshaling of some salient facts of current history for its sets, with a scathing indictment of the war-makers for its script, he has made a sickening and heart-breaking film.You need not be told that this is not an entertaining picture. One of the lobby posters at the Criterion warns persons with weak hearts against entering. The warning might better be extended to those with weak stomachs and to all who have less than a tremendous capacity for suffering. In the prologue, the theatre's management asks that there be no demonstrations during the performance, no outbreak until the film has run its course. It is an unnecessary request. There are bound to be hisses and cheers in a picture showing Hitler, Lenin, Mussolini, Stalin, Roosevelt, Hirohito and Selassie. But what kind of demonstration can be expected at its end? The cumulative effect is too overpowering for that. One leaves quietly and wishes it were possible to feel it had all been make-believe.But this isn't make-believe. The world is on fire again. Bombs have fallen in Madrid, Ethiopia and Shanghai. Babies have been dug, mangled, from the wreckage. Men and women have had their heads blown away. Corpses and fragments of bodies have been tossed in carts. The crosses that mark the graves of those who fought for peace in 1914 are extending their arms to those who are fighting for peace in 1938.

Why is that scaffolding still around the Paramount Building (the old Gulf & Western Building) on Columbus Circle? Is there any hope of its being removed?  A.  First the good news. Donald J. Trump, whose company now manages the building, at 15 Columbus Circle, says the scaffolding will be removed in three weeks.    Now for the bad news. It'll immediately be replaced with what Mr. Trump calls \\"new, improved, more beautiful scaffolding.\\"    The 50-foot-tall scaffolding was initially put up in December 1993 to keep pedestrians from getting hit by falling glass windows. The 44-story building has structural defects: it pops its windows as it twists perceptibly in high winds.    The building is being transformed into the Trump International Hotel and Tower, a combination hotel and luxury apartment rental.   The Trump Organization along with the Galbreath Company manages the building with the General Electric Pension Trust, the current owners.    They are stripping down the building to the metal, reinforcing the structure, and putting up a \\"new skin\\" designed by Philip Johnson: bronze with silver accents and floor-to-ceiling bronzed glass.    Mr. Trump says the new scaffolding will have \\"great signage and lights\\" and will be up at least until the end of the year. And the windows will pop no more, they say.  If the Sticker Lies . . .    Q.  I often find it difficult, if not impossible, to open the back doors on city buses. This despite the sticker on the door that says all you have to do is touch the yellow tape. Why, why, why? A.  Patience, weary passenger. Or strength!   That's actually an either-or proposition: Either you're pushing too hard when the doors want to open in their own good time, or the sensor's not working and you're stuck hefting their true weight.    Charles Seaton, a spokesman for the Transit Authority, says the doors are designed to open on their own. A hard push on the tape to hurry them up will only meet resistance. \\"So touch it lightly,\\" Mr. Seaton says, \\"and be patient.\\"    On the other hand, he admits, the strip could be damaged by vandalism or simple wear and tear, leaving the doors -- extra wide to accommodate wheelchairs, and therefore extra heavy -- susceptible only to brute strength.    There are 3,700 New York City Transit Authority Buses and the majority have electronic sensor technology. Mr. Seaton says that each bus is periodically checked to make sure the sensors are working. Green Arm of the Law   Q.  How much legal authority do park rangers wield? I was recently ticketed at my Manhattan Beach park for having my dog off the leash. When I couldn't produce I.D., the surly ranger threatened to arrest me for vagrancy. How much intimidation must I tolerate? Must I carry I.D. to walk around my own neighborhood? A.  Rangers can indeed arrest you. The 40 Urban Park Rangers in New York City and the 200 officers in the Park Enforcement Patrol (called PEP officers) who patrol the city's 1,560 park properties are authorized to issue summonses, request identification, take someone into custody and bring the person to the police station, i.e., make an arrest.   \\"They are trained, certified peace officers,\\" said Alexander Brash, chief of Urban Park Service, which oversees both units.    The rangers and PEP officers go through eight weeks of training on Randalls Island and carry batons, pepper gas and handcuffs (but no guns). The rangers wear big-brimmed Smokey Bear-type hats","excerpt":"the PEP officers' hats are more like the ones worn by state troopers.    In 1994, the two groups made 170 felony arrests (for crimes like setting a car on fire) and confiscated 116 weapons (mostly knives). And they issued 7,866 environmental summonses, 9,774 parking violations (mainly to people who drove on the grass) and 1,010 criminal court summonses.    And, if they see an offense being committed on park property and they are in uniform, they can even follow the perp out of the park.    But if you think that a park officer is not acting within these constraints, you can complain to the Urban Park Service, (212) 360-2781. MONIQUE P.

In these collages, the hotel interiors, crumbling facades, produce piled high in markets, mysterious alleys inhabited only by pigeons, and shops full of antiques scattered in picturesque jumbles speak volumes about an American traveler's perceptions of the Old World.

Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that she was the perfect person to teach us that there are no perfect victims, that no matter how impressive your person, how detailed your story, how unblemished your past, if you stand up and say, \\"He did this to me,\\" someone will find a way to discredit you.    And so it was with Anita Hill. Intelligent, composed, unflappable, religious and attractive, she testified to her sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas and even to her own inadequacies, agreeing that it had taken her too long to come forward, that it was hard to understand why she had kept in touch. And as soon as she left the room, she was portrayed as nut case, romantic loser, woman scorned, perjurer.    Clarence Thomas thundered about the sexual stereotypes of black men, and the Senate gasped obligingly. Little attention was paid to the stereotypes leveled at Professor Hill. Aloof.  Hard. Tough. Arrogant. This is familiar shorthand to any successful woman. She wanted to date him. She wasn't promoted. She's being used by his enemies. This is familiar shorthand to anyone who has ever tried to take on the men in power.    African-American women are sometimes asked to choose sides, to choose whether to align themselves with their sisters or the brothers. To choose whether to stand against the indignities done them as women, sometimes by men of their own race, or to remember that black men take enough of a beating from the white world and to hold their peace. The race card versus the gender card. Clarence Thomas milked the schism.    With his cynical invocation of lynching, he played masterfully on the fact that the liberal guilt about racism remains greater than guilt about the routine mistreatment of women. We saw more of Judge Thomas's character last weekend than we ever did during his confirmation hearings. What we learned is that he is rigid, histrionic and anxious to portray himself as perfect too, a man who will not even allow that two men watching a football game might talk differently than they would if there were women in the room.    The members of the Senate took to the floor yesterday and congratulated themselves on educating the American people about sexual harassment. Well, here is what they taught me:    That Senator Orrin Hatch needs to spend more time in the taverns of America if he thinks that only psychopaths talk dirty.    That the party of the Willie Horton commercials is alive and well and continuing to wrap itself in the deft smear for the simple reason that it works.    That the Democrats behaved in these hearings the way they have in Presidential elections, hamstrung by their own dirty linen, ineffectual in their pallid punches, weak advocates for the disenfranchised.    I learned that if I ever claim sexual harassment, I will be confronted with every bozo I once dated, every woman I once struck as snotty and superior, and together they will provide a convenient excuse to disbelieve me. The lesson we learned, watching the perfect victim, is that all of us imperfect types, with lies in our past or spotty job histories, without education or the gift of oratory, should just grin and bear it, make nice and try to stay out of the supply closet. \\"This sexual harassment crap,\\" Senator Simpson called it, evidencing his interest in women's issues.    What I learned from Professor Hill was different. When she returned to Oklahoma, where she may well teach all the rest of her days, unmolested by offers of high appointment because of her status as a historical novelty act, she had a kind of radiance. It seemed to me the tranquillity of a person who has done the right thing and who believes that is more important than public perception.    There is only one explanation for her story that seems sensible and logical to me, that does not require conspiracy theories or tortured amateur psychoanalyzing or a member of the United States Senate making himself look foolish by reading aloud from \\"The Exorcist.\\" There is only one explanation that seems based not in the plot of some improbable thriller but in the experiences of real life, which the members of the Senate seem to know powerfully little about.
