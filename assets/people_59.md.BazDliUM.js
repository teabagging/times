The Roman Republic already dominated most of the Mediterranean and western Europe by the time imperial rule was established under Julius Caesar. The empire was divided between Rome and Byzantium in the fourth century A.D. The Roman Empire in the west was severely weakened by Germanic invasions in the fifth century and gradually dissolved, so that Italy became a disunited collection of aristocratic holdings and independent cities. By the 10th century, the city-states, especially in the north, emerged as major powers, rivaling the Papal States of the central peninsula. Venice and Genoa emerged as major maritime powers during the medieval period, while Florence, Siena, and other cities developed into centers of agricultural and commercial wealth, impelling the successive renaissances of the 12th and 15th centuries. With the rise of the Habsburg empire, the monarchical powers of northern Europe vied for power in Italy, and the peninsula's small states became pawns of France, Spain, and Austria. At the turn of the 19th century, Napoleon created the short-lived Kingdom of Italy as a French satellite, but after his fall, there was a general return to the old pattern, with Austria dominating the north. Metternich in 1815 called Italy a “geographic expression.” The 19th century saw a growing sense of nationalism in both politics and culture. The revolutionary military leader, Giuseppe Garibaldi, and the statesman, Conte Camillo di Cavour, brought about the establishment of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. The kingdom wrested Venice away from Austria (1866) and absorbed the Papal States in 1870. Although united territorially, the kingdom was divided by conflict between church and state, north and south, modern urban industry versus semifeudal rural poverty. Parliamentary politics under the constitutional monarchy created a regime that was weak and venal, inspiring little popular support. Italy joined the Allied powers in World War I, but its minor gains in the Peace of Paris scarcely seemed to justify its wartime suffering and one million dead. Postwar economic dislocation, fear of communism, and political disillusionment abetted the rise of fascism. Benito Mussolini took over the Italian government at the invitation of the king in 1922 and soon acquired dictatorial powers. Papal secular authority in Vatican City was reestablished by the Lateran Agreement of 1929. In the late 1920's and early 1930's, Italy appeared to be a major power, defending Austria from Germany, colonizing Ethiopia, supporting Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war, and joining in an “axis” with Hitler's Germany. Mussolini, the senior partner in the fascist axis, soon was eclipsed by Hitler, and Italy was drawn into the disaster of World War II in 1939. Italy annexed Albania and invaded Greece, but that campaign turned into a fiasco from which German troops had to save the Italian army. In 1943 Allied attacks on Italy began; the fascist Grand Council deposed Mussolini, and the king, Victor Emmanuel III, had him arrested. Hitler intervened in September 1943 and began the war in Italy anew, rescuing Mussolini who established another fascist regime in northern Italy, while the legal Italian government in the south switched sides and welcomed Italy's liberation. The head of the first postwar government was a Christian Democrat, Alcide de Gasperi. The monarchy was abolished by plebiscite in 1946, and the Republic of Italy was established. The north supported the republic, while monarchism retained significant support in the south. This division reflected a roughly accurate generalization that sees Italy as a progressive commercial and industrial north and a backward agricultural/pastoral south. Despite such industrial giants as Fiat and Pirelli, however, Italy's manufacturing is primarily carried on by medium-size and small firms, while agriculture is characteristic of the whole country. As late as 1956, there were more Italian workers in agriculture than in industry. In the first elections under the republic, in 1948, the Christian Democrats benefited from American patronage and a split in the ranks of the Left to win a parliamentary majority. Italy accepted Marshall Plan aid and membership in NATO; reintegration into the European mainstream found expression in membership in the Council of Europe and the Coal and Steel Community. Domestically, reconstruction was the major task, with industrial and agricultural output severely hampered by damage from the war; inflation was rampant and basic social services impaired. The Christian Democrats, normally in Center-Right coalitions in the 1950's and Center-Left coalitions in the 1960's, adopted a policy directed at creating a stable currency, a free market, comprehensive social welfare programs, and occasional state intervention in the economy. This created an Italian “economic miracle,” with industrial production doubling between 1953 and 1961 and increasing an additional 40 percent by 1966, led by steel, automobiles, machinery, and electrical equipment. In the 1970's the Christian Democrats gradually declined in political influence, normally gaining less than 40 percent of the popular vote while continuing to provide premiers in often short-lived coalition cabinets. Left-wing terrorism became a major national problem. The Christian Democratic leader and former prime minister Aldo Moro was kidnapped and murdered in 1978, and U.S. Brig. Gen./NATO officer James Dozier was kidnapped (and subsequently rescued) in 1981. The government of Bettino Craxi, Italy's first Socialist premier, was severely shaken after it refused to cooperate with the United States in apprehending and trying the hijackers of the Achille Lauro in 1985. Craxi resigned in 1987. Lacking effective political unity, Italy's coalition governments—there have been more than 60 since the war—tended to muddle along in the face of slow economic growth, inflation, and high unemployment. But awareness of Mafia assassinations and revelations of government corruption led to demands for dramatic changes. In April 1993 the electorate overwhelmingly approved reforms that changed the basic elements of Italian political life. The first elections under the reformed system (March 1994) ended half a century of Christian Democrat-led coalition governments. The Christian Democrats, hastily renamed the Italian Popular Party, won only 11 percent of the vote, while the Socialists, normally the second largest party, fell to 2 percent. What replaced the old guard was the right-wing Alliance for Freedom. In May, wealthy publishing executive Silvio Berlusconi was sworn in as prime minister but his government lasted only into December. Political disputes, union opposition to his austerity budget, and the announcement that magistrates were investigating charges he had bribed tax officials diminished his authority. Rather than call new elections, Italy's president asked Lamberto Dini to form a new “nonparty” cabinet of businessmen, judges, and professors, a cabinet that won the requisite votes of confidence in the two chambers by Feb. 1, 1995. The new government showed surprising staying power, successfully passing its budget and negotiating reform of Italy's bloated pension system with leading trade unions. It even began the politically touchy process of investigating the anticrime magistrates for possible violations of civil rights. As corruption trials continued, the Dini government survived successive votes of confidence, the last on condition that he resign with the new year, which he did. New elections were not held until April 1996. The left-wing “Olive Tree Coalition,” led by the once-Communist “Democratic Party of the Left,” trounced the right-wing “Freedom Alliance.” Its new prime minister was Professor Romano Prodi of the Popular party. Prodi concentrated on bringing the economy into line so Italy would be eligible for participation in the EMU which, with much manevering, including a stringent austerity budget, and a sudden economic upswing, he did—formal endorsement coming in May 1998. Yet, in October, the Prodi government lost a vote of confidence over budget's cuts in social spending, unacceptable to the “Reconstructed Communists”. Prodi endorsed Massimo D'Alema of the Democratic Party of the Left (the old Communist Party). The “Olive Tree” government muddled along until the May 2001 elections, convincingly won by the right-wing House of Freedom coalition, spearheaded by Forza Italia, and bringing back Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister. Berlusconi was under indictment for corruption when in June 2003 the legislature granted him immunity until he was out of office.

Christopher Columbus visited Jamaica in 1494, and the Spanish ruled the island—exterminating the native Arawaks in the process—until it fell to British control in 1655. A haven for buccaneers, by the 18th century Jamaica was a major sugar producer and the site of one of the busiest slave markets in the world. Emancipation of the slaves in 1833 and abolition of tariff protection in 1846 contributed strongly to the subsequent downfall of the plantation economy. In 1962 the island gained its independence. The country has been plagued by racial and class division set within the context of an underdeveloped economy. Michael Manley of the People's National party became prime minister in 1972. He nationalized some industry and established closer ties with Cuba. Edward Seaga's Jamaica Labour party came to power in 1980 and encouraged more private-sector involvement in developing the economy. Though Manley was reelected to office in 1989, he did not reverse this general trend; in 1992 he was succeeded by Percival James Patterson, who led the People's National party to a landslide victory in violence-marred elections in March 1993. He was reelected in 1997 despite continuing economic problems. Jamaica"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: landlocked equatorial country in eastern Africa.

Prior to 1800 Uganda was the site of several important kingdoms, notably Buganda, centered on Kampala on the northern shore of Lake Victoria. After 1830, Arabs from the sultanate of Oman, based in Zanzibar, asserted loose control over the region and dominated its trade. British explorers, seeking the source of the Nile, reached the Lake Victoria region in the mid-19th century. Mission stations were established in 1877; a Muslim rebellion destroyed the missions and occupied Kampala in 1888. Buganda was brought under the control of the British East Africa Company in 1890, and Britain established a protectorate in 1894 that was expanded to include neighboring territories in 1896. In 1902 some of the protectorate's territory was transferred to Kenya. British immigrants extensively developed the agricultural potential of Uganda's fertile and temperate highlands, establishing large and prosperous farms. Lake Victoria was the scene of naval battles between Great Britain and Germany (established in neighboring Tanganyika) during World War I. In 1955 the British administration created a local parliamentary government in which both whites and Africans held ministerial office. Talks on the terms for independence began in 1961 and after some difficulty arrived at a formula for a national structure in which Buganda and other traditional kingdoms would retain local autonomy. Several political parties competed for power; the Uganda People's Congress led by Milton Obote became dominant. Uganda became independent within the British Commonwealth on Oct. 9, 1962. Several constitutional changes in the early 1960's led to an end to the autonomy of the kingdoms and the effective concentration of all power in Obote's presidency. In 1967 a new constitution proclaimed Uganda an independent republic. Obote was overthrown on Jan. 25, 1971, by Idi Amin Dada, commander of Uganda's armed forces. Amin declared himself president, dissolved the Parliament, and assumed absolute powers. In 1972 he expelled Uganda's Asians (primarily people of Indian and Pakistani descent), who controlled most of the country's small-scale commerce. The U.S. broke off diplomatic relations in 1973. In 1976 Amin declared himself president for life. His eight-year reign was marked by extreme violence and persecution of political and tribal opponents; as many as 300,000 may have been killed between 1971 and 1979. The country's prosperous agricultural, mining, and commercial economy was devastated, and its infrastructure, including a good road and rail network and Makerere University, fell into ruins. On July 3, 1976, Israeli airborne troops landed at Entebbe and rescued 103 hostages who had been captured in a skyjacking carried out by Palestinian and German terrorists. In 1978 Amin, with the aid of Libyan troops, invaded Tanzania. In the following year, Tanzanian troops countered by invading Uganda; they captured Kampala on Apr. 11, 1979, and drove Amin into exile. Diplomatic relations with the United States resumed. After a series of interim governments, elections in 1981 returned Obote to power. Obote's new regime was marked by repression of opponents and by rebellion in the northern part of the country by the National Resistance Army (NRA) under Yoweri Museveni. Obote fled into exile in 1985 and was succeeded by Lt. Gen. Basilio Olara-Okello, but the NRA rebellion continued. Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi mediated peace talks between Olara-Okello and the NRA in late 1985; in Jan. 1986 Olara-Okello fled, and Museveni organized a new government. Despite continued insurgencies by rival military factions and a rebellion led by the charismatic religious leader Alice Lakwena, the Museveni government restored order and, with aid from the World Bank and the I.M.F., began to rebuild Uganda's shattered society. A constituent assembly was elected in 1994. In 1995, it enacted a new constitution, which extended for five years a ban on political parties, and scheduled presidential elections for 1996, elections Museveni won with 74 percent of the vote. By 1997 Uganda had the fastest growing economy in Africa and in 1998 Pres. Clinton's visit helped to create interst among foreign investors. In a June 2000 referendum voters extended the “no party” system Museveni advocates. Museveni won re-election as president in March 2001 with 69 percent of the vote and announced in April that although Uganda was withdrawing from the Congo peace accord, its troops were withdrawing also, since they had accomplished their aim of defeating the Hutu extremists who threatened Uganda's borders Uganda"},{"year":"1925","title":"EASIER MONEY IN GERMANY.","excerpt":"9% Rate for Day-to-Day Loans -- Reduction of Rates Proposed."},{"year":"1940","title":"FTC financial repts on: 5 beet sugar mfg corps, 1939 BEET-SUGAR FIELD INCREASES PROFIT","excerpt":"9% Rate of Return in 1939 for Five Concerns, Against Prior 5.2 %, F.T.C.

They just couldn't agree on how much more. And since as a two-year player, Gonzalez wasn't eligible for arbitration until after this season, it was the Rangers who had the ultimate leverage. Yesterday they used it. After failing to win agreement on a multiyear contract or even an interim one-year deal, the team unilaterally renewed Gonzalez's contract for one year at what team officials described as \\"a very substantial raise,\\" presumably closer to the $500,000 the club had offered than the $850,000 Gonzalez had sought. Two other players not eligible for arbitration -- catcher Ivan Rodriguez, the American League Gold Glove winner, and third baseman Dean Palmer -- also rejected multiyear pacts but came to terms on new one-year agreements.   Kansas City Royals   In 10 years in the big leagues he had never had surgery, but yesterday Mike Boddicker underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and was expected to miss two to four weeks. A minor cartilage tear was repaired and cartilage under the knee cap was shaved, the Royals' team physician, Steve Joyce, said. Doctors had not expected to have to shave the cartilage, and Boddicker will be out longer than had been thought. The 35-year-old right-hander, 1-4 with a 4.98 earned run average and three saves in 1992, will be paid $3 million this season, the final year of a three-year contract.   Chicago White Sox   A disgruntled Carlton Fisk reported to camp, still stuck with a minor league contract, albeit one fashioned in an unprecedented way. The 45-year-old catcher, the White Sox's career leader in home runs, signed a contract yesterday that had to be drawn up by management's Player Relations Committee in order to include language that Fisk, a 21-year major leaguer, had insisted upon, including a guarantee barring an assignment to Class AAA Nashville. Fisk will be guaranteed $650,000. If the catcher is cut, he will be paid $800,000. If he should play 50 games, his salary would reach $900,000","excerpt":"90 games would guarantee $1.1 million.   Montreal Expos   Outfielder Moises Alou, who staged a two-hour protest by holding out at the start of spring training, had his 1993 contract renewed yesterday by the Expos, ending an exhausting round of negotiations. Alou, runner-up in National League rookie of the year voting last season, refused to sign for the club's last offer of $210,000, so he was renewed at what he and his agent predicted would be a smaller figure, possibly $200,000.   An impasse centered on the club's belief that Alou receive a split contract, meaning he would be paid a smaller salary if he were sent to the minors. But the club relented and gave him a one-way deal.   Alou followed through on a threat to boycott the start of spring training Feb. 27, holding out for two hours. He then joined workouts after being coaxed by his father, Expos Manager Felipe Alou.

But it is not about victims, victimization or brave survival. The full-evening piece, performed at Dance Theater Workshop's Bessie Schonberg Theater on Thursday evening, tells the story of a close friendship between Toby, a gay dancer who has AIDS, and Rachel, a choreographer and company director with whom he has lived.    Nothing is quite so specific in the piece, which is directed by Karen Azenberg. Bursting with ruefully funny stories about Jewish family life and guilt and the daily life of a dance company, most of them told by Ms. Lampert as she moves through \\"Inventory 1990\\" with nine other performers, the dance alludes to lives lived within the ring of a telephone call announcing another death.

The show's credibility is not helped by the fact that except for two rap numbers written by Bertin Rowser, the music sung by its contemporary teen-age characters belongs mostly to a 1970's genre that suggests a sophisticated hybrid of Burt Bacharach and the score for the movie \\"Fame\\" with a dash of Kurt Weill.   Yet despite its sugarcoating, \\"Bring In the Morning,\\" which opened on Monday at the Variety Arts Theater, frequently crackles with life. Directed by Sheldon Epps, with music by Gary William Friedman and lyrics by Herb Schapiro, the show features an exceptional cast of young performers who portray a cross section of city youths from 16 to their early 20's. About half the time the actors break through the sentimental gloss to express their confusion and defiance, along with a tough humor and an enthusiastic determination to make something of their lives.

PAUL    Created in 1886 to disprove a New York City newspaper reporter's claim that Saint Paul was ''unfit for human habitation,'' the Saint Paul Winter Carnival is the country's oldest and largest winter festival. From Jan. 27 through Feb. 5, the city celebrates winter living with ice carving (below), skating, bonspiels (curling matches), snow sculptures, hockey, the state outdoor broomball championships, art exhibits, a parade, fishing, and even ''softball on ice.''      The carnival is best known for the Ice Palace, which is built each year out of the frozen waters of the nearby lakes. The Ice Palace from the 1992 carnival, in fact, set the world record for height, at 15 stories. See www.winter-carnival.com for a full schedule of events.      As of late December, flights from New York to Minneapolis/St. Paul in time for the festival began at $203 on American Airlines.    BERLIN    The Berlin International Film Festival lays claim to the largest audience of any film festival in the world, selling up to 180,000 tickets for about 800 movie screenings. The festival, known as the Berlinale, (entrance, below) runs this year from Feb. 9 to 19, and will include the main competition, a series of experimental films, and a ''kinderfilmfest'' for children. Most of the films are European or world premieres. The world premieres this year includes an adaptation by Oskar Roehler, the German director, of Michel Houellebecq's novel ''The Elementary Particles'' and the British-Canadian film ''Snow Cake,'' starring Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver. Tickets go on sale three days before each screening (or four days, for repeat showings of films entered in the main competition) at www.berlinale.de.

Passed away peacefully, surrounded by her family, on August 19, 2004. Pat was an incredible woman devoted to her family and friends. Known for her charm, enthusiasm and positive outlook, she exuded warmth to everyone who met her. Supportive and caring, independent and strong, Pat was somebody that you could always count on. Whether bird hunting with her husband Gene, playing bridge with her friend Al, skiing with her children, or camping in Tanzania with her grandchildren, Pat was always a great sport. She was born in South Bend, Indiana, on February 4, 1924, to Marcella and George Donahue. Educated on full scholarships to St. Agnes School in Albany and Barnard College in New York, she married Gene Remmer in 1945. An Old Greenwich resident for over forty years, Pat was tremendously active in community organizations as New York City Outward Bound Director, Columbia College Advisory Board Member, Barnard College Board Vice-Chairwoman, Chair of the Remmer Family Foundation and Trustee of Girls, Inc. of Jacksonville. After Gene's death in 1988 Pat served as Chair of EHR Investments. Pat is survived by her four children, their spouses and ten grandchildren, as well as her dear friend, Albert Lewis. Memorial services will be held at First Congregational Church, Old Greenwich, Connecticut, on Saturday, August 28, at 3 pm.

Set in Soviet Russia, except for a single scene at New York's Polo Grounds, and covering a period of 30 years from 1918 to 1948, the opera focuses on Mikhoels's role as a symbol of Yiddish culture, rather than on his personal life or artistic activity per se.\\n\\nThe approach - weaving a tapestry around the life of a central figure instead of adhering to a narrative - is not new. It was used to good effect in ''Boris Godunov,'' and it works satisfactorily in ''Mikhoels'' as well, even if character and motivation are sketchy and some of the turns in plot seem a bit gratuitous.

In the next five, a half million more will be needed as the student population swells and aging boomers accelerate their march to retirement. In some ways -- by gender, race, idealism -- today's new teachers resemble their graying counterparts. In others, they are quite different.       NEW TEACHERS ARE       FEMALE Teachers are still primarily women -- 75 percent in all. But many talented women now look elsewhere for careers. A new study by the University of Maryland shows that the likelihood that a high-performing female student will become a teacher fell to 11 percent in 2000 from 21 percent in 1964. Today's women and minorities have career options that pay better (average public school salary: $46,752), treat them better and are held in higher social esteem. In 1968, 26 percent of college freshmen indicated an intention to go into teaching. Today, that number is 10 percent.      WHITE Despite a slight uptick, the number of minority teachers is still disproportionately low: 84 percent of all teachers are white, 8 percent black, 6 percent Hispanic and 1.6 percent Asian. At the same time, 40 percent of public school students are minorities.      ALTRUISTIC Like the retiring population, which was trained during the civil rights and Vietnam War years, teachers with five years' experience or less are motivated by a desire to make a difference in society and to influence children positively, according to a 2000 survey by Public Agenda. Only one in 10 fell into teaching by chance","excerpt":"96 percent say teaching is something they love to do.      NOT STICKING WITH THE JOB Fourteen percent of teachers leave the profession in their first year and 46 percent by the fifth year, a 2003 study by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future found.       The problem is partly generational, says Kate Walsh, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality: ''Twenty-somethings are not staying in any profession.'' But also, new teachers often find themselves in the most demanding work environments, ones that teachers with more seniority leave. Unprepared and unrewarded, even highly motivated teachers look elsewhere, says Caroline Hoxby, a professor of economics at Harvard.      BELOW-AVERAGE STUDENTS Teaching attracts a ''disproportionately high number of candidates from the lower end of the distribution of academic ability,'' says a report last year from the National Council on Teacher Quality. In 2004, the average combined SAT score for college-bound seniors was 1,026; the average for those who intended to major in education was 965. (Only home economics, public affairs and technical and vocational scores were lower.)       That measure is controversial: Jane Leibbrand of the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education says it does not take into account students who want to teach secondary education but who major in an academic subject. Those students have among the highest SAT scores. While college-bound seniors going into elementary education -- more than half the teaching force -- typically come from the bottom quartile of their class and have the lowest scores, those who intend to teach and major in language or literature, for example, had an average score of 1,150 last year. And those who have passed licensing tests like the Praxis II, used in 80 percent of states to measure knowledge of the subject area they intend to teach, also scored higher on the SAT -- 1,029 in 1997.      CAREER CHANGERS Post-baccalaureate and midcareer changers are teaching's biggest trend. Some 200,000 of these teachers have entered the profession since 1985 -- about 70,000 of them in the last two years, according to the National Center for Education Information. Their number is expected to grow, especially to fill shortages in math, science, foreign language and special education. Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia have created 122 alternative routes to teacher certification in recent years.       With an average age of 35 and seven to eight years' experience in another profession, this new breed brings marketplace attitudes to teaching and presents a challenge to the status quo, says Susan Moore Johnson, a professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education. Their expectations include a collaborative approach to change, differentiated workplace roles (classroom teacher, curriculum development, outreach duties) and performance-based pay. ''Schools are not organized for this type of individual or for the things they are seeking,'' Ms. Johnson says.       C. Emily Feistritzer, president of the National Center for Education Information, calls the shift to an older teaching population historic -- and an antidote to teaching's ''youth problem.'' ''These teachers are mature, see the value of education, intend to stay longer in the job and think all kids can learn,'' she says.

Beyond the sprawling, oak-lined lawns of the university, alumni Aggies have established vineyards, restaurants, hotels and enough bars and honky-tonks to claim plausibly that College Station and the neighboring town of Bryan have more drinking establishments per capita than anywhere else in the United States. College Station also has the George Bush Presidential Library, extraordinary Texas Deco architecture and the sort of relaxed cowboy atmosphere where, even if you've never uttered a y'all in your life, you'll feel downright natural about putting on a hat and boots for the weekend.   FINN-OLAF JONES    Friday    4 p.m.  1 -- Smile When You Say Hat    Bryan is College Station's twin city and the original town to A&M's gown. And nothing is more Texas cow townie than Catalena Hatters (203 North Main Street, Bryan","excerpt":"979-822-3353; www.catalenahats.com), where real cowpokes get their headgear and the place to start going native for the weekend. The rows of hats include pink felt numbers that would have made Annie Oakley proud and classic 10-gallon models that will have you staggering out on Bryan's renovated Main Street shooting your fingers in the air.    7 p.m.  2 -- Pudding, Please    Get dinner reservations at one of the most popular places in Bryan, Square One Bistro (211 West William Joel Bryan Parkway, 979-361-0264), whose main dining room consists of scarred wooden kitchen tables scattered about in a brightly painted former mortuary. The food is so fresh you'd almost swear the vegetables were growing in the back. Try the cream-of-asparagus soup, made from scratch ($4), and the rosemary roasted pork loin in sherry sauce ($14.95). Complete your meal with the house specialty: bread pudding ($3.95).    10 p.m.  3 -- Two-Stepping Time    The Texas Hall of Fame (649 North Harvey Mitchell Parkway, 979-822-2222; www.texashalloffame.net) is a cavernous honky-tonk on the southern edge of Bryan with live music and a gregarious crowd of students and ranchers (still have that Catalena on?) doing some fancy boot-scooting to live music that covers the spectrum from country all the way to Western. Willie Nelson, Pat Green and other stars of the prairie circuit regularly perform in this vast concrete hall, where $1.50 iced longnecks are liberally doled out along with shots of stronger stuff.    Saturday    9 a.m.  4 -- Hot and Comfy    Roust yourself awake at Mi Cocina (326 George Bush Drive, College Station; 979-695-6666) with huevos rancheros ($4.25) and barbacoa (seasoned beef with eggs, $4.95) near A&M's sports fields. This is where you want to start your day in Texas: murals, flashing lights, slightly divey atmosphere and excellent spicy comfort food.    10 a.m.  5 -- Gig 'em, Aggies!    Get a closer look at the gorgeous campus of Texas A&M, whose central cluster of beige and brown buildings rise out of College Station's rolling fields like a deco vision of Oz. Aggie undergraduates lead hourly tours from the first-floor Aggieland Visitor Center in Rudder Tower (979-845-5851, www.tamu.edu/visit). If you're lucky, there's a game on somewhere (check www.aggieathletics.com for schedule), and if you're really lucky, that game is football. Students filling the vertiginous stands at 82,600-capacity Kyle Field do not sit down, all supposedly ready to rush into the game as the Aggies' ''12th man.'' Throughout, they flash the A&M hand signal, a fist with thumb upturned, and yell ''Gig 'em, Aggies!'' -- a 75-year-old gesture meant to evoke the act of impaling a horned frog, symbol of their archrival, Texas Christian University. Don't miss halftime; you'd have to go to North Korea to match the choreographed pageantry of A&M's band and corps of cadets.    11 a.m.  6 -- Take an Art Break    The jewel-like Forsyth Center Galleries in A&M's Memorial Student Center (979-845-9251, http://forsyth.tamu.edu) is set up like a living room, with wing chairs, sofas and thick carpeting amid its excellent collection of paintings by American masters like Mary Cassatt, Winslow Homer, Thomas Hart Benton, Childe Hassam, Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell.    1 p.m.  7 -- Lone Star Port    Over the last three decades, the sandy soil of the Brazos River Valley has proved to be well suited for grapes, as you'll find at the Mediterranean-style Messina Hof Winery & Resort (4545 Old Reliance Road, Bryan; 800-736-9463; www.messinahof.com). Messina Hof was started in 1977 by the Aggie alumna Merrill Bonarrigo and her husband, Paul, who worked with A&M's viniculture experts to create some of the most-honored wines in Texas. Grab a light lunch in the winery's Vintage House restaurant, stroll the vineyards and sample the wines. Messina Hof's chardonnay is fruity and refreshing, but the biggest surprise is the port, which is almost as smooth as the Brazos River on a summer afternoon ($39.99 for a bottle of 2002 Paulo Port ).    4 p.m.  8 -- Into the Breech    On your way back to town, stop at the humid green meadows and clustered oaks of Tonkaway Ranch (16373 Tonkaway Lake Road, College Station; 979-776-1476; www.tonkaway.com), where Kyle Kacal and his crew will provide you with guns, gear and instruction to shoot your way through his cunning sporting-clays course, set up along 10 stations ($100 to $150 a couple, depending on level of instruction and rentals required). You can also arrange to hunt ducks and quail on the 2,400-acre ranch. Mr. Kacal serves up a delicious dinner after your shotguns have cooled off.    10 p.m.  9 -- Critical Mass of Beer    The Dixie Chicken (307 University Drive, College Station; 979-846-2322; www.dixiechicken.com) in the Northgate neighborhood, the center of A&M's night life, says it serves more beer per square foot than any bar in the country. Get your suds on, shoot some pool and take in the excellent vibe of this tavern revered by several generations of Aggies. The uniformed students you may see here are members of A&M's military corps, and the ones in the handmade leather riding boots are seniors. This is a very friendly crowd, happy to welcome newcomers, so prepare yourself for a lot of ''where y'all from?''    Sunday    11 a.m.  10 -- Presidential Brunch    When former President Bush comes to town to visit his presidential library, his meals are catered by Christopher Lampo, unless Mr. Bush just shows up at Mr. Lampo's restaurant, Christopher's World Grille (5001 Bonnville Road, 979-776-2181; www.christophersworldgrille.com), a 1913 former ranch house on the north edge of town with carved Victorian mirrors and leopard-print rugs. The brunch itself -- specialties like chilaquiles (scrambled eggs on green salsa-tossed tortilla chips, $10.95), chili-crusted crayfish salad ($11.95) and a bananas Foster French toast ($10.95) -- will make you want to yell yeehaw, though you won't want to jeopardize your chance of being served the house's excellent bloody Marys and mimosas, $8.95 each.    1 p.m.  11 -- College Station Via Yale    ''Resolution,'' Mark Balma's 12-by-12-foot painting of President George H. W. Bush and his Gulf War advisers, keeps watch over the lobby rotunda of the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum (1000 George Bush Drive West, College Station; 979-691-4000; http:bushlibrary.tamu.edu; admission $7), above. In a film, the Yale-educated Mr. Bush explains why he chose the A&M campus for his library: because of College Station's unique ''Aggie spirit.'' Wander through a life-size reconstruction of an Air Force One cabin and a room at Camp David, complete with golf clubs, campaign memorabilia, video exhibitions and declassified briefing reports.    THE BASICS    Town and 10-Gallon       American Airlines and Continental fly to College Station's airport, with stopovers in Dallas and Houston. Forget about public transportation; rent a car at the airport.     There are several charming alternatives to the major hotel chains in College Station. The LaSalle Hotel (120 South Main Street, 866-822-2000; www.lasalle-hotel.com), which is on the National Register of Historic Places, is right on Bryan's reviving Main Street. Built in 1928, the hotel was completely renovated in 2000 and features rooms with antique furniture and great views. Accommodations are $90 to $210.     Until now, the best-kept housing secret in College Station was the immaculate, faux-Victorian guest rooms at the Memorial Student Center, right on A&M's main green, the Simpson Drill Field. Anyone can rent these rooms for $65 to $110 a night and be right at the heart of the action.

A more symbolic approach to scenic design is featured in ''Festen'': family drama distilled to a table, a bed and two stairways to nowhere. Great examples of other popular styles can be sampled on and off Broadway, from the picturesque (''The Color Purple'') to the environmental (''Stuff Happens'') to combinations that only a Polonius could parse. (''The Light in the Piazza'': symbolic-realistic-cinematic?)    A style you couldn't find anywhere recently, except perhaps in high schools, is what might be called the illustrative, often characterized by painterly charm and the undisguised two-dimensionality of flats.

HARRIS surveys the work of the husband-and-wife team that produced some of the midcentury landmarks of that once-dominant style, including ''Li'l Abner,'' ''She Loves Me'' and ''Once Upon a Mattress.''

THE THEATER: 'SWEET SUE,' WITH MOORE AND REDGRAVE"},{"year":"2004","title":"THE debates are over, but the great moments endure. The Debatable Honor Roll:    BUSHSPEAK PRIZE: ''I sent up my budget man to the Congress.''    KERRYSPEAK PRIZE: ''I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of a troubled world.''    MOST PROBLEMATIC WORD: Mistake. Asked to name three mistakes he had made, President Bush declined to specify a single one. Senator John Kerry, just seconds after declaring that ''the president made a mistake in invading Iraq,'' was reminded of his famous line about Vietnam and asked if Americans in Iraq ''are now dying for a mistake.'' Without hesitation, he replied, ''No.''    MOST AWKWARD SEGUE: Mr. Bush's response to Mr. Kerry's attack on Republicans for blocking attempts to raise the minimum wage. After timidly uttering one sentence about supporting one Republican proposal to raise the wage, Mr. Bush said: ''But let me talk about what's really important for the worker you're referring to, and that's to make sure the education system works. Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act, when you think about it.''    Actually, when you think about it, that worker is probably a little old to benefit from that law unless he's violating child labor laws.    TOO MUCH INFORMATION PRIZE: Mr. Kerry and his campaign, for indignantly disputing Mr. Bush's assertion that he had passed only five bills in his Senate career. ''Once again, the president is misleading America,'' he said. ''I have passed 56 individual bills that I have personally written.''     His press office followed up with a list of the 56 legislative achievements, none of which brought to mind Daniel Webster. Among the highlights:     A ''joint resolution designating Oct. 22 through 28, 1989, as 'World Population Awareness Week'''","excerpt":"a ''resolution amending the Standing Rules of the Senate to change the name of the Committee on Small Business to the 'Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship'; a ''bill to re-designate the federal building located at 380 Trapelo Road in Waltham, Mass., as the 'Frederick C. Murphy Federal Center,''' and, lest we forget, ''a resolution to recognize the accomplishments of Lewis A. Shattuck.''    DEBATE ISSUE LEAST LIKELY TO DECIDE THE ELECTION EVEN IF ANYONE UNDERSTOOD IT: Sub-chapter S corporations.    ROSE-COLORED GLASSES AWARD (REPUBLICAN DIVISION): Mr. Bush's view of the National Guard members serving in Iraq because of a stop-loss order preventing them from retiring on schedule. ''They didn't view their service as a backdoor draft,'' he said. ''They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country.'' Then why did they have to be forced by law to take this opportunity?    ROSE-COLORED GLASSES AWARD (DEMOCRATIC DIVISION): Mr. Kerry's vision that the ''tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075.'' His math may make sense, but there just might be members of Congress with their own calculations about that money: ''Well, we could either salt it away for a Social Security recipient in 2075 or spend it on a highway in my district in 2006. Hmm. Let me think. Which of those years am I up for re-election?''    MOST EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC LINE: Mr. Kerry's quick response after Mr. Bush justified the Iraq war by saying, ''The enemy attacked us.'' Mr. Kerry called that ''extraordinarily revealing'' and said, ''Saddam Hussein didn't attack us. Osama bin Laden attacked us.'' Mr. Bush just drew more attention to it by peevishly responding, ''Of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us. I know that.''    LEAST EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC LINE: Mr. Kerry's assertion that pre-emptive American military action must pass ''the global test.'' A gift that Mr. Bush promptly seized on and never let go.    MOST EFFECTIVE REPUBLICAN LINE: Vice President Dick Cheney, who discussed Mr. Kerry's and Mr. Edwards's vote against funds for the Iraq war during the primaries by saying, ''Now, if they couldn't stand up to the pressures that Howard Dean represented, how can we expect them to stand up to Al Qaeda?'' The image of Dean the Intimidator worked so well that Mr. Bush borrowed it in the next debate.    LEAST EFFECTIVE REPUBLICAN LINE: Mr. Bush's denial that he had ever said he was not concerned about catching Osama bin Laden. It guaranteed that his original statement would be replayed again and again, leaving viewers to wonder which was stranger: claiming not to care about catching bin Laden, or claiming not to have said it in the first place.    ODDEST VERBAL TIC: Both candidates' penchant for addressing their answers to the moderator. Why, when there were tens of millions of voters watching, did they keep chatting up ''Jim'' and ''Bob''?    MOST SURPRISING LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP: Mr. Bush's analysis of the Dred Scott decision. ''Judges years ago said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights,'' he explained. ''That's a personal opinion; that's not what the Constitution says. The Constitution of the United States says we're all -- you know, it doesn't say that. It doesn't speak to the equality of America.''    SMARTEST DEMOCRATIC CONCESSION: Agreeing to the green-yellow-red-light system. The Bush negotiators, aware of Mr. Kerry's experience in debating, had fought to cramp his style with a tight format. But the strict limits proved awkward for Mr. Bush, who sometimes had trouble filling his time, while the lights were a godsend for Mr. Kerry. They forced him to do what his advisers had been fruitlessly wishing he would do on the campaign trail: come to the point and stop talking.    SMARTEST REPUBLICAN CONCESSION: Agreeing to three debates. The decision seemed questionable at first, since incumbents typically shy from debates and Mr. Bush could have gotten away with doing just two or maybe even one. His advisers explained the strategy by predicting that the more voters saw of Mr. Kerry, the less they would like him. It didn't quite turn out that way. Mr. Kerry turned in consistent performances and was, if anything, more likable in the last debate.

All these programs are being produced with the cooperation of the Kool Jazz Festival. Why is the festival competing with itself? Presumably, there are quite a few jazz fans out there who can't afford the prices at Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall, and it's very public spirited of the festival's producer, George Wein, to have thought of them.

Gimmicky, yes. But Pig Heaven is one of those exuberant places we all need once in a while. And some of the food is good.   The specialty of the house, of course, is pork, everything from Cantonese-style roast suckling pig ($5.95 for a small portion, $10.50 for a large one) to spicy white cooked pork with garlic sauce ($7.50), barbecued pork butt ($5.25 small portion, $9.50 large), minced pork sauteed with corn, bell peppers and pine nuts ($8.95), and much more. One of the better offerings is the suckling pig. The moist, flavorful meat is concealed under a thick slab of crisp fat that would make a cardiologist blanch.

Cardboard is never far below the surface in Lloyd Evans's sets, yet the small scale and drab atmosphere prove appropriate to the humble circumstances of Puccini's bohemians. All that needs to be added to bring the opera to life is plausible action and a good, balanced cast of singers.   City Opera generally does well by this work in those respects, too, and at the first performance of the season, on Saturday afternoon at the New York State Theater, the company supplied both in reasonable measure. Don Yule and William Ledbetter, in their well-traveled portrayals of the comic Benoit and Alcindoro, minced and simpered overmuch, but Beth Greenberg's stage direction was otherwise relatively restrained for this house.

Right on the heels of Thursday's opening, led by Tina LeBlanc and Tom Mossbrucker, the Joffrey offered two other casts of principals. The Sugar Plum Fairy and her Prince on Friday night were Jodie Gates, dancing with exquisite classical style, and Tyler Walters. Saturday afternoon's performance at the City Center (131 West 55th Street), where this \\"Nutcracker\\" is in residence through Dec. 1, was led by Deborah Dawn, in a debut as a glamorous Sugar Plum, partnered by Scott Jovovich.

But in \\"The Nutcracker,\\" this struggle is seen, delightfully, from a child's point of view and is symbolized in the Nutcracker's battle with the mouse monarch.   Details and close-ups would seem inimical to the sweep and grandeur of Balanchine's choreography, with its sophisticated use of pattern and structure.
