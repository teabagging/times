The problem wasn't that the sets -- bare wood scaffolding and walls that looked like rusted metal collages -- weren't serviceable suggestions of the prison of the evil tyrant Don Pizarro. It wasn't even that the concept was untenable: this 1970 production by Otto Schenk is relatively traditional in its treatment of character and plot. The problem was that no one involved seemed to care very much one way or another about anything. The stage directions of a generation ago have by now become formula. It is live tradition hardened into rote ritual. Review/Opera","excerpt":"The First Met 'Fidelio' of the Season"},{"year":"1991","title":"WAR IN THE GULF Why Can't America Make a VCR to Match Its F-117?  Radar-jamming F4-G Wild Weasels carrying antiradiation missiles disrupted Iraqi defenses Wednesday night. As F-117 stealth fighters led the attack, the skies were initially all theirs. The first reports indicated that America's technological superiority was manifest. So why can't the United States make the world's best VCR's? Or subcompact cars? Scholars say the nation's military sophistication at best leaves its economic competitiveness unharmed. \\"Defense needs are not the same as civilian needs in most industries,\\" said Michael E. Porter of Harvard Business School in his recent book. Defense products can sometimes serve other ends","excerpt":"the first military jet transport evolved into the Boeing 707. But sometimes, he said, military contracts merely blunt healthy business competition. Paul Kennedy, a Yale historian, goes further, saying that the nation's military responsibilities are eroding its economic advantages. \\"Rome fell; Babylon fell; Scarsdale's turn will come,\\" he said. Only the week before last, the Pentagon canceled a $57 billion program to build a new Navy attack plane when the ultimate cost appeared far greater than Scarsdale and the rest of the nation can afford. Traders in Battle  American traders were as awesomely prepared as the military for war in the Middle East: all set for a furious aerial battle, the destruction of Saudi oil refineries and panic buying of oil. They had pored over tables showing that when war breaks out, investors dump stocks. And so, when American jets flew virtually unopposed Wednesday night and the Saudis initially escaped with damage to a single storage tank, traders were able to change course faster than F-15's. On Thursday, the Dow climbed 114.60 points on heavy volume, the second-best day ever. Oil futures dropped by more than $10 a barrel in a day, then, on Friday, fell by $2.19, to $19.25. And yet, the euphoria may prove fleeting; William H. Donaldson, the New York Stock Exchange Chairman, warned investors against acting in haste.   Oil Companies React to War  The oil companies responded to the American assault with their own patriotic proclamations. Terrified of seeming to profiteer from a war, they announced wholesale price freezes and restricted deliveries of gasoline. Then oil prices fell. Companies quickly rewrote their press releases to define the frozen price levels as ceilings. CNN's Coup  Gen. Colin L. Powell tuned in to CNN for the latest from Baghdad, and Tom Brokaw interviewed one of its correspondents when NBC's own line to Iraq went dead. On Wednesday night the network scored its highest ratings ever, with 11 million homes tuning in. Gripping accounts of the attack on Baghdad from the only three reporters able to stay on the air throughout the evening gave CNN an audience in a class with the three broadcast networks for the first time. As the networks economize, CNN boasts of its advantage in covering crises abroad. Ted Turner's challenge has been to keep everyone watching once trouble subsides.  Several television advertisers pulled their commercials off the air during war coverage last week. Some said that the upbeat news so far was encouraging them to return. A Damper on Airlines  Nothing is worse for airlines than higher fuel prices and a recession. The AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, lost $215.1 million in the fourth quarter, its worst quarterly loss ever. The UAL Corporation, which runs United Airlines, also expects to report its worst quarter. And the fuel costs contributed to the shutdown of Eastern Airlines. International airlines said the war had caused some cancellations, but domestic lines saw little difference. Airline executives hope that last week's plunge in oil prices will bring them relief. Meanwhile . . . in Lithuania  With the United States and Western Europe preoccupied in the Middle East, the Soviet Army assaulted Lithuanian patriots last week. Tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled through a crowd to seize the republic's broadcasting tower. James H. Giffen, chairman of the Mercator Corporation, said the underlying issues concern control of Soviet property, tax revenues and lawmaking. He spoke of having to negotiate a Soviet oil-drilling agreement with four agencies where, in the old days, one would do. \\"Am I distressed by it as an investor? Yes,\\" he said. He expects business conditions to improve when an All-Union agreement is signed, but few other analysts are as optimistic. COMPANIES   Last Flight at Eastern  Eastern Airlines shut down at midnight Friday, the victim of labor strife, disaffected travelers, fuel costs and leverage. Founded in 1928, the airline was the favorite ticket for millions of pallid Northerners seeking to bask in the Florida or Caribbean sun. Eastern has struggled to turn a profit since filing for bankruptcy protection almost two years ago in the grip of a strike. About 5,000 of 18,000 employees face immediate dismissal. Assets to be sold include 190 planes and some routes that rivals covet. But travelers are bound to emerge happier than unsecured creditors. The court has set aside $50 million to reimburse holders of Eastern tickets. A Difficult Time for Banks  Thomas H. Hanley, a managing director at Salomon Brothers, has analyzed the banking industry for 24 years, but the fourth quarter of 1990 shocked him. \\"I've never seen anything like it,\\" he said. \\"It's probably the most difficult quarter during the entire postwar era.\\" For most banks, the only question was whether earnings and bad loans were as awful as expected, or worse. Citicorp had already predicted large losses, but Manufacturers Hanover had seemed relatively safe from real estate woes. A few of the strongest banks, like J.P. Morgan and BankAmerica, had stronger earnings, and lower interest rates helped many banks improve their margins.  But analysts say there is no end to bank losses in sight.  I.B.M. Beats the Recession  The International Business Machines Corporation defied the recession by reporting higher earnings and revenues in the fourth quarter. Net income rose fourfold to $2.46 billion, from a final quarter a year ago that included heavy charges for cutting the work force. The company's operating income still rose 16.1 percent. I.B.M.'s chairman, John F. Akers, cautioned that global uncertainties lie ahead. Bankruptcy's Yield  Truth in labeling comes to Wall Street: Bear, Stearns & Company announced the creation last week of a new, merged department of bankruptcy and high-yield trading and sales. \\"What can I tell you?\\" said a Bear Stearns representative. \\"Bankruptcy and high yield seem to have something to do with each other.\\" The new department's two leaders have the right experience. Nancy Havens-Hasty made a well-timed move in 1987 from the firm's risk arbitrage department to its bankruptcy group, and Donald Mullen was a managing director at Salomon Brothers in high-yield sales. At Oxy, No Sacred Cattle  Ray R. Irani wants everyone to know that all the changes he plans at the Occidental Petroleum Corporation are no reflection on the Armand Hammer legacy. Circumstances change, Mr. Irania said. And so he christened \\"the new Oxy\\" -- his words -- last week. He intends to concentrate on oil and chemicals, sell $3 billion in assets, take a $2 billion charge against earnings and cut the dividend from $2.50 to $1 a share. It so happens that many of the money-losing businesses up for sale were Dr. Hammer's favorites, among them a Soviet petrochemical project, Chinese coal mining, Arabian horses, Black Angus cattle and the film production company whose perennial star was Dr. Hammer himself. Daily News's Future Dims  The Daily News threatened on Wednesday to close or seek a buyer by early April unless it stems losses that it says are running at $1 million a day. The announcement gave the newspaper's nine striking unions a choice of signing new, cost-cutting contracts or facing the permanent loss of jobs. The Tribune Company, the corporate parent, demands as much as $70 million in labor cuts and the right to make future changes in work rules without having to bargain. Miscalculations may have brought The News to this point. Tribune executives did not sell the newspaper when it still had a circulation of 1.1 million and loyal advertisers; union concessions would make it far more valuable, they figured. Now at least half the readers, most of the advertisers and probably most potential buyers have deserted. Only a pile of unfunded liabilities remains. THE ECONOMY   Few Inflation Fears  Was anyone fretting last week about the highest annual inflation rate since 1981? Certainly not most economists, and probably not the Fed. True, the 6.1 percent increase in consumer prices for 1990, up from 4.6 percent in 1989, could not be attributed entirely to the cost of oil. \\"We still have some problems,\\" said Joseph A. Wahed, senior economist at Wells Fargo. \\"Service costs are high. Medical costs are high.\\" But the raging price increases of a few months ago have quieted, leaving December's index just three-tenths of 1 percent higher than in November. Inflation seems so much less of a threat than continued recession that those close to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said he has wanted to lower interest rates faster all along, but those pesky presidents of the Fed's regional banks would not let him. Mr. Greenspan has made no apologies; he reportedly said last week that lower oil prices and interest rates could help ease the recession.   In Brief  The White House plans to ask Congress for an additional $80 billion to rescue 225 more failing savings and loan institutions. Legislators reacted sceptically. By next month, the Government expects to exhaust the $50 billion bailout fund set aside last year.

Read the British author Patricia Angadi's first novel, THE GOVERNESS (Gollancz/David & Charles, $18.95) and initially you'll be left cold. The novel opens in 1918 in London","excerpt":"the first narrator in this book of many narrators is Eleanor Lane-Baker, a stereotypical weary wife and exasperated mother of six. Eleanor raises questions that by 1918 standards were bold: ''Why should not men, at some time in their lives, be made to suffer as women do? Why should they not have the agony of both menstruation and giving birth?'' The futility of these questions aside, Eleanor does the only thing she believes a woman can do - she hires another woman, Violet Mabel Herring, known as Herry, to be governess in her household. Once Herry becomes part of this family's fabric she is referred to as a saint by Edward, Eleanor's husband, and five of their children, and perceived as an evil force by the not-quite-reliable son, Justus. All the reader knows for certain is that Herry seems quite capable, smiles a lot and is quite tolerant of Eleanor's and Justus's sarcasm. Patricia Angardi supplies the reader with each family member's point of view on Herry between 1918 and 1938; what these alternating narratives make clear is that the book has less to do with Herry's sainthood or evil than with the ubiquitous neuroses of the family. So while the author's intention may have been to create a black tale about the insidious nature of blind benevolence, the family's dissolution - which includes Edward's seduction of Herry, Miles's suicide and Helen's nervous breakdown - seems inevitable regardless of Herry's role as a ''red herring,'' blamed for the problems of the Lane-Bakers.

The American Civil Liberties Union, its officers, Board of Directors and staff deeply mourn the passing of a principled, influential and pioneering leader on civil liberties. Dr. Clark was 90. The US Supreme Court cited his study on the effects of racial discrimination as an influence in its historic 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional. The ACLU was a friend-of-thecourt participant in the case. A towering figure in the struggle to end legally sanctioned racial discrimination, Dr. Clark was instrumental in developing the strategy to dismantle the system of explicit racism and overturn Jim Crow laws across the country. Even with the success of his efforts, he still understood the continuing effects of systemic discrimination. ''This is probably one of the most dangerous things facing manking today: A use and training of intelligence excluding moral sensitivity'', Dr. Clark once said. Throughout his career, he was always committed to integration because of his larger vision for what a diverse democracy ought to be. Where some civil rights leaders later came to question the value of integration, Dr. Clark defended the premise that an integrated American society would be better for everyone. An educational psychologist whose life work encompassed racial integration and improvement in the education of black children, Clark became a part of the ACLU in 1970, serving as a member of the national Board of Directors for one year. He joined the ACLU's National Advisory Council in 1985. He assumed chairmanship of the council in 1991, a post he retained until his death. ''The ACLU has persisted in meeting the most difficult tests of being the moral conscience of our nation'', Clark said in 1980. ''It has protected the fundamental political and human rights of all Americansindeed of all human beings within our jurisdiction''. Clark is survived by his daughter Kate C. Harris, and son Hilton B.

Died November 20, 2003 in Los Altos Hills, California, at the age of 80. He was predeceased by his loving and beloved wife of 54 years, Rose Kleiner (2001). He is survived by his children Robert Kleiner and Lisa Kleiner Chanoff, grandchildren Jake Kleiner and Yael, Talia and Eli Chanoff. Eugene was one of the founding fathers of Silicon Valley, a journey that began with the German occupation of his birthplace Vienna in 1938, forcing his family to escape through France, Belgium and Portugal, and finally find passage to the United States where they settled in New York in 1941. At the end of World War II after serving in the United States Army, Eugene took advantage of the GI Bill and earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Polytechnic University, New York, and a Master's of Industrial Engineering from New York University. In 1947 he was married to Rose Wassertheil, who had escaped the German invasion of Poland in 1939. In 1952 his son Robert was born, and four years later the family moved to California after Nobel Prize winner William Shockley recruited Eugene from Western Electric to join him and seven other scientists and engineers to start Shockley Laboratories in Palo Alto. In 1957, these eight men, who became known as the ''Fairchild Eight'', broke away from Shockley and founded Fairchild Semiconductor","excerpt":"the first successful company to manufacture the silicon based transistor. This effort spawned the industry which would eventually transform Santa Clara Valley into the Silicon Valley and was the basis for all of today's information technology. In 1959 his daughter Lisa was born, and two years later the family moved to a new house that they built in Los Altos Hills, in which Eugene and Rose would live for the rest of their lives. In 1962, he left Fairchild to start ventures of his own including Edex Teaching Machines which was bought by Raytheon. As a limited partner with Davis & Rock, and a first round investor in Intel, Eugene began a new interest in venture capital. In 1972 he joined with Tom Perkins to form the partnership now known as Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers which has spawned over 300 companies including Compaq, Genentech, Tandem Computers, Sun, and Amazon. Since becoming ''Partner Emeritus'' at KPCB, Eugene served on numerous corporate boards, advisory committees, and college boards. In 1989 he received an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from Polytechnic University where he had served as a Trustee. Eugene was inducted into the Silicon Valley Business Hall of Fame, and in 2000 was named Outstanding Mechanical Engineer of the Century by Polytechnic University. Throughout his career he was a respected mentor and advisor to many. He died in his home that he built 42 years ago on a hill overlooking Silicon Valley. Memorial services will be held at Congregation Beth Am, 26790 Arastradero Rd., Los Altos Hills at 1:00PM, Friday, December 5, 2003.

Three years of high inflation that peaked at 10.9 percent late last year have made prices here among the highest in Europe. And thank your stars you didn't visit in January and February, when (because of high interest rates here) the pound soared to about $2. The dollar has made a partial comeback since then, but only to about $1.65, where it hovered last summer. Inflation is still running at about 6 percent, and the value added tax (V.A.T.) that is included in the price of everything from souvenirs to hotel rooms was raised from 15 percent to 17 and a half percent last spring. This means that prices have gone up from 5 to 10 percent since last year.    Over a longer period of time, the cumulative effect of high inflation, plus the dollar's steep decline since its heyday in the mid-1980's, is even more dramatic, particularly in London, where prices are the highest in the British Isles. An average pair of women's shoes at the Manolo Blahnik shop at 49 Old Church Street that cost $100 in 1984 now costs $330, according to the shop. A made-to-measure, king-sized polycotton blanket cover at the Monogrammed Linen Shop, 168 Walton Street, that cost $56 in 1985 now costs about $114, $6.60 more than a year ago. Cashmere twin sets that cost between $95 and $105 in 1985 at Westaway & Westaway, 62-65 Great Russell Street, now cost $327.

Fishermen are warm-blooded, fish are poikilothermal, their body temperatures change with that of the waters in which they swim.   In winter, while most fishermen stay warm indoors, the fish are left out in the cold. Some, like weakfish, mackerel, and shad, migrate offshore and south. Blackfish and flounders move offshore and into deeper waters where they often find warmer currents in which to school. Winter flounder often dig into the bottom muds of inshore bays. The cold slows the cold-blooded down. Fish move less. They feed less. Which all works out for the better, because the diminishing daylight hours since the fall and the cooling season have reduced the amount of food available for them to eat.

Although it has its queer and unconvincing cinematic ideas, it is in many respects a worthy contribution. Its dramatic value is never pulsating, but it succeeds in holding the attention. Whether it will prove as interesting to those who have not read the book is problematical, for in un furling the incidents in the lives of the five persons who went down to their death when the bridge collapsed the producers leap from one to another of the individuals, with the result that the details are at times a trifle vague.It is, however, a film that shows resourcefulness, especially in the opening and the closing chapters. The stage settings are wonderfully realistic, notably the Incan span and an interior of a church in which Brother Juniper, appealingly impersonated by Henry B. Walthall, tells in audible tones from the pulpit the story of the lives of those who were catapulted into the chasm on that fateful July 20, 1714. His voice dies away as the silent story comes to the screen, but in the final sequences he is heard and seen again ending his chronicle before the hundreds in the vast edifice.There are scenes in this film for which Mr. Brabin is obviously not accountable. But there are others which Mr. Brabin might have pictured in a more believable fashion. He betrays a desire to pack too much in the film, and in his direction of Lily Damita he might have obtained more effective work with some slight restraint, even granting that Camila, La Perichole, was no paragon of docility. There is a tendency to make the Marquesa de Montemayor a trifle too hard in the initial stages, but Emily Fitzroy, who plays this part, succeeds splendidly in depicting the bibulous old aristocrat in subsequent sequences.It fell to the lot of a Mexican actress, Raquel Torres, to act the rôle of Pepita. It is nicely portrayed, with a genuine and pleasing conception of the convent girl's loyalty and faith. Ernest Torrence gives an admirable interpretation of Uncle Pio, but his physical appearance rather belies the character. On the other hand, the twin brothers, Manuel and Estában, played respectively by Don Alvarado and Duncan Rinaldo, strike one as being true to the types of Mr. Wilder's story.Motion picture conventionalities demand, or are supposed to demand, even in a narrative such as this, some suggestion of romance, and therefore there is here a gratuitous secret love between Pepita and Estában, which rather weakens than strengthens the picture.Mr. Brabin has, however, taken full advantage of the chances for gentle humor and general interest in the letter writing done by Estában and Manuel. The episodes where the frowsy, wrinkled, wine-sodden Marquesa is dictating epistles to her daughter in Spain are set forth with imagination and appreciation of the author's description. So are the pas sages where La Perichole conducts her correspondence with the bullfighter.One of the lamentable errors Mr. Brabin makes is in dealing with the accident that led to Manuel's death. Instead of Manuel striking his leg against a piece of jagged metal, as in the book, Mr. Brabin shows La Perichole pushing Manuel and he falls down a long flight of stone steps. This is presented so that it looks as though Manuel were intentionally accelerating the impetus of the tumble as he rolls over and over.While Estában was grief-stricken at his brother's death, it is not especially pleasing to see him try to end his life by hanging, even though Captain Alvarado throws open the door in time to cut the young man down.It is a shame that these motion picture notions were permitted to enter this production, for pictorially it is a most impressive piece of work.The stage program is far and away the best thing that the Capitol management has offered for many a moon. It presents a sort of revue known as \\"Steel Blues,\\" wherein the costumes of the figurantes are inspired by various parts of machinery, such as crankshafts, cog-wheels, gears and so forth. It is an offering that is endowed with a wealth of imagination as well as glamour. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Five Who Fell. A Russian Vampire.

The museum was conspicuously short on French Romantic paintings, and that meant short on works by Gericault. But the painter of \\"The Raft of the Medusa\\" and \\"The Wounded Cuirassier,\\" those towering landmarks at the Louvre, has always been considered principally a figure painter, and this was one of his rare landscapes, and an odd one at that -- unusually large for a landscape from that era, and depicting an ambiguous scene, cast in slanting light, of swimmers bathing near a hill town.   Whether this work filled a gap or merely added a curio to the collection was at issue, not least among museum trustees, whose debate over the acquisition was lively. No one argued more strenuously for the painting before those trustees than Gary Tinterow, an associate curator of European paintings. Fortunately, the work's advocates won the argument, as the compact exhibition Mr. Tinterow has organized at the museum called \\"Gericault's Heroic Landscapes: The Times of Day\\" handsomely confirms.   \\"Evening,\\" which was revealed as a more vividly colored and intricately modeled composition after a thorough cleaning by the museum, could be seen during the last several months holding a prominent spot in the Andre Meyer wing. It has been temporarily moved several galleries away to be joined for the show with two companion landscapes by the artist -- one from Munich representing \\"Morning,\\" the other from Paris representing \\"Noon.\\" Related prints, drawings and paintings round out a presentation of about 30 works that serves not only to justify the significance of the Metropolitan's purchase, but also to describe a crucial moment in the evolution of French landscape painting.     Gericault, Mr. Tinterow cogently argues in the show and its accompanying catalogue, strove in making such large-scale landscapes to elevate that genre to a stature accorded at the time only to images of grand historical subjects. He depended not on nature studies but on art-historical sources to piece together these scenes, in the case of \\"Evening\\" borrowing from the works of artists like Claude Joseph Vernet and the little-known Antonio Carracci. The Romanticism of Gericault's image is signaled by its imposing scale and its disorienting disproportion of elements.   \\"Gericault's Heroic Landscapes\\" is the latest and one of the best examples of the focused, small-scale exhibition that -- in light of escalating costs for large-scale shows -- has become increasingly appealing to museums. Like the shows at the Metropolitan within the last few years based on Caravaggio's \\"Lute Player\\" and Andrea Mantegna's \\"Descent Into Limbo,\\" it encourages viewers to look at art in precisely the way blockbusters discourage, closely and slowly and in depth. If that alone were the accomplishment of this show, it would be justification enough.   But Mr. Tinterow has done considerably more than that. Through painstaking archival research and clever detective work he has managed to reconstruct much of the history of this curious painting and its partners from Munich and Paris. The inquiry led him, in one instance, to the conclusion that fraud may have been perpetrated. The prospect of a lost fourth landscape, depicting \\"Night,\\" was proposed last year by a Paris artist and dealer named Nat Leeb, who maintained that he once owned the work and made a sketch of its composition. Mr. Leeb died this year.   Representations of the four times of day -- morning, noon, evening and night -- were a common decorative cycle for 18th-century artists, and Gericault's landscapes depended on 18th-century sources (one such cycle by Vernet is on view in the fine French landscape show at Colnaghi, 21 East 67th Street). Mr. Leeb's claim sounded plausible.    But Mr. Tinterow came to believe that Mr. Leeb invented the sketch by copying a work of Theodore Chasseriau. The fourth landscape was most likely never completed by Gericault, who had become involved with \\"Raft of the Medusa\\" -- the shipwreck image becoming, in a way, substitute for \\"Night.\\"   Of the three landscapes he did complete, the most impressive is \\"Morning,\\" with its large-scale, sculptured figures and simply resolved composition. But \\"Evening\\" has a richness of detail in the rendition of the town and its ruins, and its bathers point toward the Michelangelesque rhetoric that Gericault perfected in \\"Raft.\\"   What the Metropolitan got with this work was a striking image that hints at the grand themes and ambitions of French Romanticism. What the museum provides with Mr. Tinterow's splendid exhibition is an introduction to that period and to one of its dynamic protagonists.   \\"Gericault's Heroic Landscapes: The Times of Day\\" remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through Jan. 13. 'Brancusi: Masterpieces From Romanian Museums' Gagosian Gallery 980 Madison Avenue (at 76th Street) Through Dec. 15   There's one masterpiece in this so-called masterpieces show, although the artist would have been the last to have made such an inflated claim for this intentionally humble work: the first version, from 1907, of \\"The Kiss,\\" a subject to which Constantin Brancusi would return many times in his career. There's also \\"The Prayer,\\" that tough, pathetic image of a kneeling woman, from the same year, which signaled the artist's turn toward abstraction.   The four other sculptures, dating from the years 1905 through 1909, serve mostly to round out a picture of the artist's early development. \\"Pride\\" from 1905 typifies the studies in facial expression that were standard components of every sculptor's academic training at the time. \\"Head of Boy\\" (1906) brings to mind the meltingly impressionistic sculptures of Medardo Rosso while still remaining squarely in a traditional mode.   Against the backdrop of these two works, \\"The Kiss\\" and \\"The Prayer\\" seem all the more daring. With the former, Brancusi took an enormous creative leap. It is not simply the abstracted, glyphic way in which he reduces two embracing figures, faces pressed together, to a few simple marks carved in a block of stone. It's also the subtle variety of those marks -- the gentle swelling of the woman's breast","excerpt":"the flattened, elongated shape of her hands; the suggestion, through a few incised marks, of hair flowing down her back. As with Cycladic or Egyptian sculpture, what looks at first formulaic reveals itself to be richly detailed.    With \\"The Prayer,\\" Brancusi was commissioned to render a female figure not sexually but as a symbol of mourning. He achieves this by a combination of gestures, none more startling than the clublike hand that curls tightly against her chest or the arm cut off abruptly above the elbow. The slightly swelled belly, the sharp cuts around the pelvis, the hulking legs and deep gouge in the back contrive to spell pain.   The considerably less inspired \\"Sleep,\\" from 1908, dates from around the period, long denied by Brancusi, when he apprencticed in Rodin's studio. According to the art historian Anna Chave, who is completing a book about Brancusi, the work announces its Symbolist ties. But it looks as interesting for its connection to the artist's later sculpture, \\"The Sleeping Muse.\\"   \\"Brancusi: Masterpieces From Romanian Museums\\" is a modest, academic display that nonetheless suggests a good amount about the evolution of this foremost modernist.

This Sunday's Mass -- an \\"Earth Mass\\" -- is being celebrated as part of the church's St. Francis Day Festival and will feature the Paul Winter Consort and a sermon by Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee. Some of the stranger pets that children have taken to the blessing are algae and pythons. But if your family's pets are more prosaic -- cats, dogs, rabbits, goldfish, monkeys -- they're more than welcome, too. The 11 A.M. Mass will run about two hours, so be prepared to sit with your animal until the blessing procession begins toward the end. Then the church's own bestiary assemblage -- an elephant, llama, horses, goats -- goes to the altar to receive, along with everyone else's pets, a blessing from the bishop. From 1 to 5 P.M., the outdoor fair takes place, featuring the Ralph Lee Mettawee Theater Company (a puppet and mask ensemble), a marionette theater, animals to adopt, pet contests, a petting zoo, an art exhibition, nature walks and vegetarian foods.

'Fantastic Plastic' New York Hall of Science  47-01 111th Street  Flushing Meadows-Corona Park  Queens  (718) 699-0005  Recommended ages: 8 to 10  Tomorrow and Sunday    To some people, polymers and plastic are mysterious entities that are the purview of bifocaled scientists and secretive conglomerates. Even the word \\"polymer\\" sounds artificial to laymen, as if it were an element beamed down by the starship Enterprise. But a polymer is simply a substance made up of many small, similar molecules that join to make a large molecule, or a polymer. And plastics are made of polymers. This weekend, children can go to one of the 75-minute workshops at the New York Hall of Science and put those definitions to work -- making slime, a fluidlike polymer. A high-school and college teacher will help children make this gooey stuff by mixing a solution of polyvinyl alcohol, sodium borate, guar gum and food coloring. Children will also be able to make their own polyurethane \\"super ball\\" and discuss different types of plastics (including biodegradable ones) and their effect on the environment. Tomorrow's workshop is from 2 to 3:15 P.M.; Sunday's is 1 to 2:15 P.M. The fee for each workshop is $12 per child; $3.50 for an accompanying adult. The museum can be reached from Manhattan by taking the No. 7 train to 111th Street and walking five blocks south. 'Do You Hear What I Hear?'   Little Orchestra Society  Florence Gould Hall  55 East 59th Street  Manhattan  (212) 704-2100  Recommended ages: 3 to 5  Tomorrow and Sunday      The seventh season of the Lolli-Pops concerts begins tomorrow with the theme of listening discerningly to symphonic music. So it's time to dust off the Mary Janes and take the wool knickers out of the cleaners: concertgoing time has arrived for New York's youngest patrons. The Lolli-Pops resident members -- Bow the Panda, Toot the Bird, Buzz the Bee and Bang the Lion -- will, with the help of Dino Anagnost's Little Orchestra Society, instill in the audience the differences between high and low notes, soft and loud notes, slow and fast notes. The children will be taught how to recognize these differences in various pieces of music, like Sousa's \\"Semper Fidelis\\" and Copland's \\"Hoe-Down\\" (from \\"Rodeo\\"). The hourlong concerts take place in an attractive theater with comfortable plush seats, and children receive a gift to take home. It's a good idea to arrive early because the combination of young children and wheel-to-wheel strollers makes for a noisy scene. An elevator is available. Shows are tomorrow at 10:15 and 11:30 A.M. and Sunday at 1:15 and 2:30 P.M. Single tickets are $30; subscriptions for the three concerts in the series (the others are Nov. 2-3 and 3 23-24) are $84. Windmill Day   Alley Pond Environmental Center  228-06 Northern Boulevard  Douglaston, Queens  (718) 229-4000  Recommended ages: 3 and up  Tomorrow      The Alley Pond Environmental Center is a 618-acre woodland and wetland enclave with extensive trails. The center also conducts workshops and classes for children and adults on subjects ranging from gulls to longstitch needlecraft. Tomorrow, visitors will have the chance to see firsthand the inner workings of the center's newly built windmill. The original windmill burned to the ground a few years ago; a close replica was constructed and finished just recently. Its blue-and-white front door and brown shingled facade are a homey touch among the cattails and weeping willows. Inside, visitors will get to see just how a windmill works -- in this case, one that pumps water -- by climbing two steep ladders to the top. The redwood container on the balcony, which offers a verdant vista, looks like a hot tub. The windmill pumps water from below the ground to the surface; the water is then used to replenish the surrounding land and encourage new flora, like wildflowers. After the tour, visitors may wander along the trails, where the dense rustling reeds, marshiness and vociferous birds can make you feel like you've entered the heart of the Everglades. (You might want to take boots.) The windmill tour costs $2 for adults and $1 for children, and is given every half-hour from noon to 4 P.M. 'Look and Look Again: Children's Art  From Armenia'      Children's Museum of Manhattan  212 West 83d Street  (212) 721-1223  Recommended ages: 4 to 12  Through December      Armenia has been in the news quite a lot this year, but many people do not have an extensive knowledge of its civilization, which dates back 5,000 years. One way for children to understand Armenians and their culture might be to explore this art exhibition, a show comprised of about 100 paintings from the State Center for Esthetic Education in Yerevan, Armenia's capital. The exhibition is a sample of work produced by the 6,000 children enrolled every year at the center and its satellites. There are classes in painting, storytelling, dramatic play, woodcarving, embroidery and sculpture. This exhibition's sophistication is intriguing and surprising, and descriptive labels enhance the artworks, which are arranged by theme -- nature, spiritual life, portraits, catastrophe, still life, genre and cultural heritage. Ara Aslanian, a 6-year-old, painted a brooding and expressive portrait of his mother. \\"Earthquake,\\" by an 11-year-old, is a moving painting that depicts toppled church crosses. \\"Occupation,\\" by a 6-year-old, is dominated by a tank but also by an intensely bright, long-lashed sun in a corner. All of the paintings are unexpectedly touching and ruminative. The museum is open from 1 to 5 P.M. on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays; from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Saturdays and Sundays. Admission: $4. A catalogue is available for $2. Keep in Mind   \\"WILLIAM TELL AND OTHER SWISS FOLK TALES,\\" in which the storyteller Vit Horejs will use traditional European marionettes to tell the legend of William Tell, as well as stories influenced by the German, Italian and French presence in Switzerland. Tomorrow at 2 P.M. at the Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 65th Street, Manhattan. Admission: free. Information: (212) 595-9533.   FAMILY GALLERY HOUR, an informal walk in the galleries of the Museum of Modern Art, introducing children and adults to different aspects of various collections. Tomorrow at 10 A.M. at the Edward John Noble Education Center at the museum, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan. Admission: $5 a family, which includes a free return visit.

There is in \\"After Business Hours,\\" the new film at the Colony, a poor young creature who stumbles into pit after pit of misfortune, and when things brighten up in the end it is done as if the scenarist, tired of the volumes of difficulties encountered by the attractive woman, had decided to end the narrative with a hug and a kiss, which is not essentially original.It is surprising that this script was written by Douglas Z. Doty, who took it from a narrative by Ethel Watts Mumford. Mr. Doty knows stories, as when he was editor of The Century Magazine, several years ago, he distinguished himself by accepting Stacey Aumonier's classical short story, \\"The Friends.\\" Yet Mr. Doty paints a most gullible young heroine in Mrs. June King. She is afraid to tell her husband when she is in trouble, which, in the first place, would undoubtedly have been overlooked. This tale could have been worked out in a much more plausible fashion, as it has the nucleus of a sound plot, none too new, but nevertheless interesting.John King, impersonated by Lou Tellegen, has original ideas about wives. He thinks that they should have their husband's love and be able to get anything they wish in the sartorial line on charge accounts, but that they should never receive more than a nominal sum of money. June at the outset loses $150 in a poker game to Mrs. Wentworth, and she is forced to give an I O U for that amount. At first she thinks that she will ask her husband for the money, but he unconsciously stops her from doing so by offering her $10 for tips and incidentals. John is a man of means, and the mention of such an amount is ridiculously petty. One almost expected Mrs. King to fly into a rage and say she wanted $1,000. She, however, takes the $10, and eventually gets out of the difficulty by pawning her bar-pin, the villain, Richard Downing, having an interest in the pawn shop which caters to poor wives of rich men.John gives his wife a string of pearls and then she finds herself in a frightful financial muddle through betting on the races as the results come over the radio. So, of course, she pawns the pearls, getting an imitation string to take their place. All one has to say to June is \\"gamble,\\" and she has the fever for it, when the average child might realize that she has not a ghost of a chance of winning.June develops a real pawning mania, Mrs. Wentworth a garrulous old gambler, who is fortunate at cards, drops a valuable brooch in June's boudoir. At first June is inclined to return the brooch, but as she has been worried by a blackmailing chauffeur, the weak creature decides to pawn it. This nets her more worry and trouble. One could pick holes in almost every situation of this story, but we won't.Elaine Hammerstein appears to have a great deal more character than the women she impersonates. Mr. Tellegen is a little old for the part of such a husband. John Patrick makes a husky villain.There is an element of interest in this picture, as one never knows how foolish Mrs. King is going to be in the next chapter.

The authors of the articles were the club's guests of honor: chroniclers of the performers, artists, designers, fashion addicts and the self-styled ''fabulous'' who populate downtown Manhattan and fill the pages of New York City's newly resurgent alternative press.   Four monthly periodicals are now competing for the attention of downtown readers and of uptowners who want to know what's going on below 14th Street: Details, Paper, New York Talk and The East Village Eye.   Details is primarily a fashion magazine, but it is best known for its extensive coverage of club culture. Paper is a humorous tip sheet that tells where to go, what to buy and what's happening downtown. New York Talk and The East Village Eye are both tabloid-size stapled newspapers","excerpt":"the former is an ad-heavy giveaway, and the latter offers pure-to-the-point-of-insular coverage of the East Village state of mind. THE DOWNTOWN PRESS: 4 IRREVERENT JOURNALS"},{"year":"1947","title":"Within the familiar framework of the Walt Disney story-cartoon, that magical gentleman and his associates have knocked out a gay and colorful show—nothing brave and inspired but just plain happy—which came to the Globe on Saturday. It is lightly and carelessly titled \\"Fun and Fancy Free.\\" And, while the emphasis is more on the first part than on the second part of that compound, it's okay.Again, as in such previous grabbags of animated doodling as they've broached in \\"The Three Caballeros\\" and \\"Make Mine Music,\\" Mr. Disney and his ever-clever boys are offering a variety entertainment, made up of two main episodes. One is a charming little fable about a circus bear named Bongo, and the other is a Disneyesque revision of the \\"Jack in the Beanstalk\\" story—with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and the knuckle-jointed Goofey as familiar intruders in that slightly twisted tale.The latter, in our estimation, is more fanciful","excerpt":"the former is more fun—though there isn't a great deal to choose between them, so far as novelty goes. Cued onto the screen by Jiminy Cricket, who opens the proceedings with the title song, the story of Bongo pops directly into the accustomed and thoroughly genial Disney groove, even though based upon a foolery from Sinclair Lewis' pen.It's the story of a poor little bruin who, battered and yanked around by his unfeeling masters in the circus, yearns—and finally manages—to escape. Once in the wide open forest, he finds life not too easy for a circus bear, until he meets a beguiling she-bruin who inspires him into transports of love. Woolgathering in a blissful love-land populated by bear (not bare) cupids who atomize pink clouds out of flit-guns, he is suddently dashed to earth by a ferocious rival suitor. Need we say it all ends happily?The narration for this episode is supplied by Dinah Shore, who also sings a couple of theme songs which bid fair to be upcoming hits. We'd call it a Mexican stand-off between \\"Lazy Countryside\\" and \\"Too Good to Be True.\\" And \\"Say It With a Slap\\" is an amusing spoof of a barn-dance tune. To this one, the bears of the forest cut—shall we say—a bear-rug.Apparently Mr. Disney thought he had something cute in the use of Edgar Bergen to narrate his second episode. But the live-action cut-ins of Mr. Bergen relating the \\"Beanstalk\\" tale to Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd, his two famed dummies, and a little girl named Luana Patten are not inspired. The humans, as usual, look incongruous. (For that matter, don't we all?) However, the characteristic comments of Charlie on the story are an aid.For it is a frankly mocking fable wherein Mickey, Donald and the Goof, as starving peasants in a barren land, climb up a towering beanstalk and liberate the singing-harp from a mean giant. Only the giant is not a real meanie; he is just a pin-head idiot type, name of Willie, and his glandular behavior burlesqued by Disney, is refreshingly droll.That is the nature of the picture—familiar and fairly obvious. But there is one passage in it which the sophisticates should find much to their taste. That is the passage wherein the beanstalk sprouts and reaches toward the sky, writhing and gliding in the moonlight to the rhythms of a flutey symphony. There is madness and menace in this sequence, a sort of evil fascination for eye and ear, restrained by climactic comic touches. It is such stuff as this in Disney pictures that nourishes faith.

It is with deep regret that we announce the passing of Gregory J. Spevok, of Kenilworth, IL, on Sunday, January 29, 2006 in an auto accident. Beloved husband of Elisabeth (nee Pratt), loving father of Katherine, Eleanor, and Phillip, loved son of Stanley and Catherine. Greg was a Managing Director of the Corporate and Real Estate Capital Markets Groups at LaSalle Bank Corporation. He enjoyed an outstanding reputation at the forefront of the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities business. Not only was Greg a charismatic and compelling leader, but he possessed an impressive technical command of the real estate lending business. In spite of his professional success, Greg was always humble and approachable. Competitors routinely sought his counsel, and, like those who worked with him, considered Greg to be a steadfast friend. His real estate lending career was extensive. Prior to LaSalle, he was the Director of Originations for Bear Stearns' CMBS unit, where he built the firm's nationwide source network as a member of the senior management team that repeatedly set the CMBS industry's record subordination levels. Previously, he established FINOVA Capital's East Coast commercial real estate lending practice. He also created and led the real estate lending program for Dai Ichi Kangyo Bank's Tokyo Leasing (USA). He began his career as an Analyst in the Financial Institutions Group of First National Bank of Chicago, for which he served in both Chicago and New York. His integrity, acumen and reputation, led to LaSalle Bank hiring Greg to head its CMBS operation out of Chicago. Under Greg's leadership, LaSalle Bank's CMBS unit met with great success. Greg oversaw the unit's growth from a nominal regional player to one of the dominant forces in real estate loan securitization. Greg also served as the driving force behind the emergence of the Bank's Multifamily Finance Group as a ''top 3'' provider of capital to the apartment and manufactured housing sectors. In 1992, he was the principal founder of the Real Estate Lender's Association, Inc., the largest lenders-only commercial real estate organization in the U.S. Other involvements include Sustaining Fellow of the Art Institute of Chicago","excerpt":"the Founder's Council of the Field Museum; the Real Estate Roundtable's Capital Advisory Policy committee; and the Board of Directors of the National Multi Housing Council.

EVERY two years, the Venice Architecture Biennale awards a prize for the best urban planning and architecture to a city. New York has never received this award because, apart from a handful of great old buildings, it has had little to show of architectural innovation for the past 50 years. Great architecture has rarely been a goal of our political decision makers, as we have witnessed in recent weeks.

It is a warm-weather entertainment with handsome scenes and both bright and trite lines. In it the comic El Brendel is busy as a romantic butler named Alex Svenson. Marjorie White and Frank Richardson supply vigorous turns and William Collier Jr. appears as Conrad Sterling, who has sown a few wild oats at the wrong time.There is the young woman who refers to having a heavy date with a bricklayer","excerpt":"the French maid, played by Yola D'Avril, who on several occasions threatens Alex, her paramour, with \\"J'arrache le coeur, je coupe la gorge, et je creve les yeux,\\" which is conveniently translated by Alex to a good-looking blonde as meaning, \\"There is a man with heart trouble waiting to see me.\\"A lumber king is called a woodpecker and Vera Fontaine (Miss White) tells George Randall (Mr. Richardson) that the man she wants must have more than a couple of high notes and a pair of wooden shoes. George, a song and dance expert, reminds Vera that she had told him not so long ago that he was the cream in her coffee, to which she retorts, \\"But you've turned sour.\\"An attractive young woman tells Alex that she does not wish to play second fiddle to any one and he reminds her that she does not have to play any music, for there is an orchestra where he is taking her.There are several catchy melodies in this attraction. Miss White sings \\"I'd Love to Be a Talking Picture Queen,\\" and she and Mr. Richardson render \\"Emily Brown.\\" El Brendel and Miss White contribute \\"I'm Bashful\\" and Mr. Brendel and Noel Francis chant \\"I Feel a Certain Feeling Coming On.\\"The story tells of the frightful misunderstanding between Conrad Sterling and Mary Mason, acted by Miriam Seegar. Mr. Sterling has had a fuss in a night club to which are given screeming headlines in a newspaper, and Miss Mason, who happens to be a musical comedy performer, is much disappointed in the man she thought she loved. She refuses to see him again, but Sterling has his wits about him and a fair supply of money. He arranges with the producer of Mary's show to bring the whole production to the home of Sterling's uncle, Marvin Kingsley, who is no better than he ought to be. Kingsley is very proper before his nephew, but to a blonde or two he happens to be known by the sobriquet of Dodo.Mary does not know that Sterling lives in the house, believing the host's name to be Dodo. She is quartered in one of the largest rooms, in which to her astonishment she finds photographs of Sterling on the mirror, on the door, on the telephone receiver and under it; in fact, in every conceivable corner where a photograph could be placed. And finally the original of the picture turns up himself.Mr. Brendel spends some of his time sitting on a bowl of ice, which he is endeavoring to conceal from Gloria de Witt, played by Noel Francis. He does not wish her to know that he is merely a butler. Mr. Brendel also furnishes a moderate amount of fun with a trick necktie.There are many lavish scenes with dancing girls, but, unfortunately, there is little idea of sound perspective; for when a person is at a distance from the camera or close to it the singing is of the same volume.This feature, however, has its merry moments and a certain dash. Miss Francis is quite captivating in her numbers. J. M. Kerrigan affords some mirth. Huntly Gordon is satisfactory as the philandering Kingsley. Mr. Collier is equal to the demands of his role. Yola D'Avrill does well as the maid, and Mr. Brendel invariably is funny.On the surrounding program Mr. Rothafel has staged another of his artistic efforts, with Gilda Gray as a dancing queen. It is known as \\"Aladdin.\\" THE SCREEN; Dash and Fun. Boisterous Fun."},{"year":"1980","title":"NOWADAYS, small neighborhood restaurants run by young people are springing up all over town.

They were laughing at France -- and with good reason. President Jacques Chirac's arrogant decision to defy the world and go ahead with two nuclear bomb tests in Polynesia deserves contempt.

We had rather a drama misbehave than not behave at all. We had rather a dramatist become too excited over his theme, letting his excitement show in it, than present it as though it were something offered for a master's thesis in domestic philosophy. As pictures go, this one is interesting enough, well played and on the adult side, but, hang it, it never explodes.The problem presented—then mulled over, restated, explained and really never resolved—is one of husbandly behavior when a wife is secretly discovered having an affair. Instead of shooting her, as a friend suggests, or even of upbraiding her, M. Papon decides the fault is his. He is middle aged and has become careless in his dress. At least part of that can be corrected. He has not been successful. Well, he can try. Instead of sitting, slippered, by his radio, he can (with success) cut a figure in society, surround his wife with gracious people, make it possible for her to travel.So he does. But the affair goes on and then what is a husband to do? \\"A Man and His Wife\\" gives Harry Baur's M. Papon the patience of Job, the wisdom of Solomon and eventual success. At least the wife decides not to run away and he has the satisfaction of reading a sermon about forgiveness being the nobility of courage. Presumably Mme. Papon never will know that he had found her out. And presumably she has learned her lesson. It may be, but we rather doubt it—all of it. We doubt, too, that the picture would have been half as interesting as it manages to be without Mr. Baur. He is good, even when we don't believe him.At the Teatro HispanoBelated echoes of the conflict between Bolivia and Paraguay, which cost 100,000 lives between July, 1932, and June, 1935, and was only brought to a definitive settlement last Summer, are being heard on the screen of the Teatro Hispano this week. \\"Alas sobre el Chaco\\" (\\"Wings Over the Chaco\\") is the Spanish-language version of Universal's \\"Storm Over the Andes,\\" and it was shown in Harlem once before for a couple of days.While neither masterpiece nor \\"news-reel\\" of the war in South America, this mixture of feats of derring-do in the air and of romance back of the front is smoothly directed by Christy Cabanne, and is technically excellent. Lupita Tovar, one of Hollywood's most charming bilingual players, is good as the slightly flirtatious wife of a Bolivian commander (Antonio Mereno), and José Crespo is efficient as a daredevil mercenary aviator. Taken as mere entertainment, with no pretensions to preaching or truth-telling, \\"Alas sobre el Chaco\\" is fairly amusing.

The number in the state has held fairly constant for years. Thus when a new one appears, fans of Japanese cuisine (and as one-time brief residents of Japan we are among them) are quick to pay a visit. Mannen, just off Route 35 in Ridgefield, is tucked into a small shopping complex in a free-standing building previously occupied by an Italian restaurant. A clue to finding Mannen (its name means 10,000 years, the ultimate) is the large white globe lantern glowing in the entrance window.   The interior decor has echoes of the previous occupant, with dark wainscoting, a long brick wall and wooden booths opposite, and a cast-iron stove in the rear. An attempt has been made to establish a new identity, with oversize gilded paper fans on the walls.    Admirers of sushi and sashimi will be pleased to find both specialties on the menu. But it is disappointing to discover that there is no sushi bar. This means that the pleasure of inspecting the various fish available and watching the sushi chef at work is missing. It requires a giant leap of faith to order raw fish unseen. We took the plunge anyhow, with a deluxe sushi. Although the price was reasonable, the selection was mundane for such a label. There were nine pieces of norimaki-zushi and six nigiri-zushi, or hand rolls, all served on a traditional wooden platter. Included were maguro (tuna), ebi (shrimp), ikura (salmon roe) and flying fish roe. Missing were uni (sea urchin), mirugai (giant clam), anago (sea eel), tako (octopus) or ika (squid), which make a deluxe assortment special. Despite the lack of a visible sushi bar, the individual pieces tasted fresh, and a generous amount of wasabe and gare (pickled ginger slices) accompanied the platter.   Mannen offers a sizable number of appetizers, which were among the menu highpoints. Tako su (sliced octopus in a light vinegar dressing) was tender and flavorful as was hijiki (cooked seaweed). Age tofu (deep-fried tofu) was another success","excerpt":"the fresh bean curd square was light and supple, the batter sheer and minimal, and the shavings of katsuobushi (dried bonito) atop added a briny flavor. Yakitori (broiled pieces of chicken breast on tiny skewers) was piping hot, tender and well-seasoned.   Nasushigi (fried eggplant with sweet miso sauce) might have frightened off the unitiated, it was so lacking in the usual elegant Japanese style of presentation. It was a large, unrecognizable slab covered with a brownish sludge that oozed like a swamp thing over the plate. Despite its looks, the eggplant with its slathering of miso and sprinkle of sesame seeds on top was surprisingly tasty.    Among the entrees, the most intriguing choice was shoga yaki, consisting of several fingers of chicken or pork in a mild ginger sauce. Beef negimaki was also competently prepared: slices of tender beef wrapped around scallions, which provided a sharp taste and textural contrast.   Our biggest disappointment was shrimp tempura (all-vegetable or a vegetable-shrimp mixture were also options). The portion was generous but the flabby, doughy batter surrounding each shrimp bore no resemblance to a traditional wispy, crispy tempura batter, and the tempura sauce lacked the zap of grated ginger.    Desserts are limited. Green tea ice cream was bland but refreshing, while the ginger ice cream needed more of a ginger snap. An unusual dish called kan-ten was described as seaweed jello with apple juice. It was an apple-flavor mixture with the consistency of soupy applesauce, decidedly an acquired taste.   Dinner for two -- three courses each -- was $33 before tax, tip and drinks. There is a full bar, and two brands of Japanese beer (as well as other beers) are available.

Let us pause in the examination of more transcripts of the Wick tapes, some of which need careful authentication before publication, to examine the ethical issue: What's so bad about secretly recording what people say to you on the telephone? Doesn't taping serve the cause of accuracy? Doesn't everybody in government and top business management do it?

Mr. Jackson's previous film, the art-house hit ''Heavenly Creatures,'' was an ugly exploitation of a real-life crime. ''The Frighteners,'' too, takes off from a real crime -- Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate's murderous spree through Nebraska. But here the tone is rambunctious and loose-limbed, something like the 1945 comedy ''Murder He Says,'' in which Fred MacMurray plays a census taker who encounters a clan of killer hillbillies headed by Ma Kettle herself, Marjorie Main.     The focus here is on Michael J. Fox (right), playing a small-town widower cursed after the trauma with the ability to see the spirits of the dead. He uses this skill to make a con man's living as a ''psychic investigator.'' He sends his ghost buddies (the odd-couple team of Jim Fyfe and Chi McBride) to haunt homes, then turns up to solve the problem and reap the rewards. ''The Frighteners'' gets under way when his latest scheme brings him into contact with a young woman, that lovely and undervalued actress Trini Alvarado, whose husband soon joins the town's growing list of the dead.

Actually the weight per square inch of any tire is always equal to the air pressure in the tire. Any tire inflated to 32 pounds per square inch, for example, presses down on the pavement with 32 pounds per square inch. Also, tires of various aspect ratios but with the same inflation pressure and supporting the same weight will have contact patches of different shapes but with the same area.   Narrower tires, better for snow, sink deeper because of their different proportions of length and width of the contact patch's shape. The edges of the patch along the sidewall lead to an almost vertical wall that lets the tire sink into snow","excerpt":"the front and rear edges of the patch at the tread lead to a very gradual slope, following the curvature of the tire, that buoys the tire. A narrow tire's contact patch is long and narrow, maximizing steep and minimizing sloping edges. This minimizes flotation and the tire sinks into the hard packed snow underneath where the tread's lugs can get a bite. In contrast, a low profile tire's contact patch is short and wide, minimizing the steep and maximizing the gently sloping edges.

He seems to have no wish whatsoever to try to show, through the sharp and subtle ways that might be allusively injected out of a contemporary knowledge of psychology, why it is that this whimsical woman is so brutal and/or foolish towards these men—or, indeed, why it is that two of them are so politely submissive to her.Allowing that Mr. Schlesinger and Frederic Raphael, who prepared the script, wished to be faithful to the novel, which is conspicuously opaque and passionless in presenting the slow, tormenting turnings of its heavy, coincidence-ridden plot, it seems most insensitive and wasteful that they should have let their main characters be so flat that a modern-day viewer finds it most difficult to become involved with them.Evidently Mr. Schlesinger was hopeful that a strong and extravagant insistence upon the nature and beauty of the bucolic environment would provide an absorbing surrounding, that would cushion the banality of the plot and counterpoint the conventionality of the characters, as it does in the book. Thus he has given much of his picture and a lot of its almost three-hour running time to a brilliant and handsome detailing of the Wessex country and atmosphere.He has given long stretches of his picture to brilliant color illustration of the lovely countryside—the round, rolling hills and sheep pastures stretching to the sea","excerpt":"the fruitful farms, the sturdy stone buildings, the ancient towns and the winding roads. And he has generously filled it with florid peasants and full-bodied animals.Indeed, the environment is more impressive than the slow, mawkish drama it contains, and the peasants are more assertive and colorful than the main characters. Scenes of sheepherding, farm gatherings, harvest suppers and assemblies at markets and fairs are more energetic and entertaining than the bloodless confrontations of the principals.Some of these do have their vitality, such as the famous scene in which Bathsheba is boldly confronted on the moors by the arrogant Sergeant Troy and is given a fantastic display of dexterity with the saber, or the fateful encounter of Bathsheba and Troy over the coffin of his former mistress and her still-born child.Even the scene with the saber is too abrupt and inadequately prepared. It should be clearly presented to the audience as a sort of spontaneous courtship dance, like that of a woodcock or a gamecock. As it stands, it looks a bit maniacal.Here again it is because the character of Troy, who is darkly and stiffly played by Terence Stamp, is not sufficiently established and developed as the complex eccentric he must be. And the personality of Bathsheba, whom Miss Christie shapes with sullen attitudes, has not been adequately illumined to make us ready for her evident sexual surge.As for Alan Bates's performance of the supine bailiff, Gabriel Oak, it is simply adorned with rustic humors, and Peter Finch's Boldwood is conventionally stout and heavily shaken with bursts of passion that are as arbitrarily inserted as the thrashing storm.Actually, Mr. Schlesinger has committed nothing fresh or even contemporary in the way of cinematic story-telling in this film, except for some rather handsome and slightly self-conscious photographic and editing techniques. He has merely presented us a surface picture of the shapes and shadows of \\"Far From the Madding Crowd.\\"THE credits for \\"Those Fantastic Flying Fools,\\" the period comedy which opened at neighborhood theters here yesterday, say that Peter Welbeck's original story was \\"inspired by the writings of Jules Verne.\\" That, however, is only part of the truth. It seems also to have been inspired by \\"Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines,\\" which, in its turn, had been more than a little inspired by Michael Todd's extravagant version of Verne's \\"Around the World in 80 Days.\\" The inspiration is now running somewhat thin.The producers of this colorful rehash, however, have had the intelligence—if not exactly the originality—to hire Terry-Thomas and Gert Frobe to carry the comic burden in \\"Those Fantastic Flying Fools,\\" a turn-of-the-century farce haying to do with the launching of the world's first moon rocket.It's all been done before, and better, but there are still some smiles left in the sight of Mr. Frobe, the Germanic inventor extraordinary, unwittingly preparing a disastrous new experiment with his rocket explosives. You hardly even think of Wernher von Braun.And Terry-Thomas is always a delightful schemer, especially when—on occasion—the situations are right. There is one very nice moment when he stops his horseless buggy at a street gas lamp. Because the car apparently uses illuminating gas, his friend, Lionel Jeffries exclaims indignantly:\\"The entire principle of this machine is dishonest. It runs on stolen gas!\\"There are few such moments, however, even though the British countrysides are lovely and all the performers attractive, including Daliah Lavi Dennis Price. Hermione Gingold (in what is practically a walk-on) and Burl Ives, who plays Phineas T. Barnum, who is somewhat less famous as a Verne hero than Captain Nemo.

The sorrow is for a dedicated teacher who is upset by her inability to ''reach'' and change her students","excerpt":"the frustration is because teachers and aides are still being sent into classrooms totally unprepared and untrained to work with children who have autism, and the anger is because a teacher, in her total ignorance of how to deal with her class, has managed to cast aspersions on the ability of autistic children to learn, and to substantially denigrate the work of both professionals and parents who have proven again and again that children with autism can and do achieve.   My son is 13 1/2, a similar age to the students in the class described by the anonymous teacher, and is also being taught in a class of six students who are autistic. He is called ''autistic'' not because the label has either positive or negative connotations, but because it describes his etiology and functioning. He is severely impaired in the areas of language and socialization. He is hyperactive as well, and is prone to severe behavioral problems. His I.Q. score, taken one year ago, places him squarely in the severely retarded range.

The term Abstract Expressionist doesn't roll easily off the tongue when applied to Pousette-Dart, but officially he counts as one and, according to Sam Hunter's introduction to the present show, he produced the first of the big canvases characteristic of the movement - the 7 1/2- by 10-foot ''Symphony No. 1,'' of 1942. Younger than Abstract Expressionism's pioneers and older than the artists in its second wave, Pousette-Dart was included in some of the early shows promoting the movement - but not in the climactic ''New American Painting,'' which toured Europe from 1958 to 1959. But by that time, the artist had already signaled his social independence by moving to upstate New York rather than Long Island, which to the Manhattan art world was - and may still be - what the ''hills'' were to Kipling's India.

Less happily, McDonald's is among the most visible and widely criticized symbols of America's throwaway society. Now, however, McDonald's is at last showing some McSense on the environment.    Over the next two months the company will phase out its familiar plastic foam \\"clamshell\\" boxes and switch to paper containers. Since paper is more easily compressed than foamed polystyrene, McDonald's contribution to the nation's scarce and increasingly expensive landfills will be reduced by about 90 percent.   The company's decision, announced last week, is the result of an unusual alliance with one of the country's most aggressive environmental groups, the Environmental Defense Fund. In July 1989 Fred Krupp, the fund's executive director, wrote to Michael Quinlan, McDonald's president, requesting a meeting on environmental issues.    A year of informal talks led to the creation of a joint task force to examine McDonald's production of solid waste and to recommend solutions. The company preferred a recycling program","excerpt":"the fund argued that recycling wouldn't work since 60 percent of the clamshell boxes leave the restaurant and can't easily be recaptured. The company eventually yielded, partly, as one executive admitted, because \\"our customers just don't feel good\\" about foam packaging.   McDonald's alone accounts for 8 percent of the one billion pounds of foam packaging sold in the U.S. But the environmental benefits may be less significant than the process that produced the agreement. Corporate America and America's greens are hardly on the best of terms. Companies tend to dismiss environmentalists as impractical visionaries; environmentalists tend to rely on confrontation, either in the courts or the political arena. McDonald's and the Defense Fund bet heavily on cooperation. And so far, everyone is winning.

Theatrically, the Crossroads Theater Company's new musical, in its world premiere, has a long way to go before reaching cohesiveness.    The story of Bongi -- a nickname for Sibongile, which means \\"We give thanks\\" in Zulu -- is taken from recollections of children going to school in the cold darkness of early morning. The show's collaborators, Thuli Dumakude and Welcome Msomi, who are married, saw such groups \\"running along the highway\\" years ago, as Ms. Dumakude recounts in a program note.    Awaking at 5 A.M. for a two-and-a-half-hour trek to school on the frosty ground, singing all the way, Bongi dreams of being a teacher. Her father, who is not granted a permit for a proper house because of his rural upbringing, dies in a mine explosion in Johannesburg.   \\"All of a sudden my mother found herself responsible for all the decisions in the family,\\" Bongi tells us.   In execution, a familar story theater style mixes narrative, musical and choreographic passages and gives a handful of performers a slew of storytelling and role-playing assignments.    Bongi's mother finds a job on a farm, which is sold to the government. The family is forced to move 400 miles away. Bongi gets through college, becomes a teacher -- and is imprisoned, for in the classroom she is committed to honest revelation, which means exposing, not explaining, the schoolbooks. \\"What you read is not true,\\" she tells her students, referring to the texts' version of how \\"apartheid could not be avoided.\\" But the truth is compromised when an official \\"visitor\\" appears.    \\"How can you teach the truth when every day somebody is watching over you every single minute?\\" Bongi cries out. \\"I was going to be responsible and mold and nourish these minds.\\" Soon, she is imploring the class not to challenge the authorities, while at the same time urging the students to speak out, as they walk out with fists in the air.   Plainly, Bongi's journey isn't just literal. It encompasses education as a mission of life and a metaphor for survival -- and salvation.   While certain passages are poignant and one about ancestry approaches eloquence, the importance and implications of Bongi's tale do not transcend the flatness of the telling. It is when \\"Bongi's Journey\\" bursts into song that the show takes off.   The score is an array of traditional hymns, prayers and warriors' songs and original compositions by Ms. Dumakude and Mr. Msomi,all sung in Zulu. The musical interludes, pulsating and often thrilling, are not smoothly integrated into the spoken parts, however.    Throughout scenes that are meant to be shattering -- and some are -- the audience is are subjected to didacticism and ponderous prose: \\"It's a barren stretch of land with no running water\\" and \\"Oh, life is strange.\\"    Or self-serving dialogue: \\"When will it end?\\" \\"It will end when we rebuild this barren place with our hands.\\"   And homilies on cue: \\"Someday we must take care of ourselves.\\" \\"You are who you are because of other people.\\"   \\"Bongi's Journey\\" is, in its present stage of development, a misalliance of overworked polemics, stirring moments and striking stage pictures. Witness the children's being taught amagendo, a stone game","excerpt":"the fusion of five radiant cast members in a tearful lamentation with a purpose: to free a nation and its children; the haunting image of a displaced people, carrying lanterns, crates, baskets, basins and chairs.   Credited to Mr. Msomi and Ricardo Khan, the Crossroads staging, astonishingly, makes visible in a small space a panorama of emotional turbulence, blending pain and exultation.    \\"Bongi's Journey\\" lacks the potency of such models of South African protest musical theater as \\"Sarafina!,\\" which was seen on Broadway, or last year's Crossroads production, \\"Sheila's Day.\\" But Ms. Dumakude gives a superb acting and singing performance as Bongi. In what may be the most overextended effort of the season, Ms. Dumakude also co-wrote the book, the vocal arrangements and much of the score and choreographed the show.   Clearly, it is the book part that appears most effortful. As it appears, the most urgent message of \\"Bongi's Journey\\" -- the resilience of children and the bonding of a community in response to injustice and dehumanization -- lies in music and movement.      \\"Bongi's Journey,\\" produced by the Crossroads Theater Company, 320 Memorial Parkway, New Brunswick.

Although few expec t that the Congressional hearings will result in abolishing th e agency, many in the commodities industry, as well as state regulat ors, have become concerned about the measures the commission ha s taken, proposes to take and may be forced to agree to in order to a ssure its continued existence.   Last Friday, for example, a group of state officials met with Philip McBride Johnson, the commission chairman, to press for a greater role in regulating commodities trading. The group, the North American Association of Securities Administrators, wants to reverse the agency's exclusive jurisdiction in this field, which Congress granted as part of the original mandate in 1974.

Behind the News -- The redesign eliminates underground galleries where the names of the 9/11 victims would be inscribed. Instead, the names will be found on a plaza above the voids where the towers stood. This and other changes will lower the price tag by $162 million. Still, the project is estimated to cost $510 million.    A COMMITMENT    The News -- Japan announced that it would begin pulling troops out of Iraq.    Behind the News -- About 600 soldiers have been in southern Iraq since 2004, providing reconstruction assistance. The contingent is Japan's most significant military mission since World War II. Despite the withdrawal plans, Japan remains a supporter of the American effort in Iraq. Even as he announced that the troops' mission was fulfilled, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said the air force would increase its support flights for American soldiers.

Worse, though, the team also lost its country: with Montenegro's secession in an independence referendum, Serbia and Montenegro no longer exists.

But Mr. Rather did not hide his displeasure at what he perceived as the network's refusal to give him significant work since he stepped down as anchor of the evening news last year after a reporting scandal.    A FAMILY TREE    The News -- The pool of Genghis Khan's descendants is not quite as big as thought.    Behind the News Although a genetic test had shown that Thomas R. Robinson, an accounting professor in Florida, was descended from the Mongol conqueror, a more complete test showed that the initial result was faulty. The reversal may be a bit of a blow to Mr. Robinson, but it hardly takes the sheen off Genghis's image.

Equal parts surliness and insouciance, it is one of the few visual flashcards (along with baggy jeans and backward baseball caps) shared by such disparate male teen-age tribes as sidewalk-surfing skateboarders, grungy air-guitarists and style-setting hip-hop hordes.\\n\\n COME AGAIN? O.K., maybe the recent ubiquity of post-adolescent chins carpeted with a two-week growth of stubble is less a question of style than inevitability. The previous choice for flaunting youthful manhood was the threadbare mustache","excerpt":"the fuzzy chin is the natural alternative.\\n\\n WHAT IT IS NOT: It is not a soul patch, that tiny tuft of hair that bongo-playing beatniks used to favor directly below the middle of the bottom lip. (The patch tried a comeback about two years ago when Luke Perry, the \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\" heartthrob and sideburn popularizer, wore one in the comedy film \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\\") It is also not quite a goatee, the previous social hair phenom it most resembles. The fuzzy chin lacks the goatee's Faustian air and, more often than not, a mustache, although some scruffy actors like Johnny Depp or Ethan Hawke have sprouted hints of hair above their upper lips. And finally, it definitely is not that full-beard-minus-mustache look favored by Amish gentlemen and Abraham Lincoln. The fuzzy chin is unable to muster anything near that level of maturity or implied earnestness.\\n\\n DRAMATIS PERSONAE (PART I): The fuzzy chin projects a certain nonthreatening fashion shorthand for teen-age alternative culture. Consider its past archetypal wearers. In the late 1950's and early 60's, it was Maynard G. Krebs, the hapless beatnik sidekick of that lovelorn sitcom lead Dobie Gillis. In the 1970's, it was Shaggy, the cowardly hippie sidekick of Scooby-Doo, the animated canine detective. By the 80's, even a mass-marketed pop crooner like Donnie Wahlberg of the New Kids on the Block could appropriate the look for a bit of corporate-approved rebellion. These days, Mr. Wahlberg's kid brother, Marky Mark, the rapper and the former Calvin Klein underwear pitchman, turns up on the June cover of Tell, the new preteen magazine, with a healthy growth on the chin.\\n\\n DRAMATIS PERSONAE (PART II): Of course, there is the darker side. Toss in a shaved head, a body map of tattoos and a testosterone-charged thrash-metal band, and you get the spooky fuzzy-chinned Phil Anselmo, the lead singer of Pantera. Try on a leather jacket, a mop of unwashed hair and a willowy girlfriend, and you get the calculatedly rebellious fuzzy chins of Mr. Depp or Mr. Hawke.\\n\\n NATURAL HABITAT: Those hoping to spot the look might try the cube sculpture at Astor Place in the East Village, where skateboarders spend the better part of the day; downtown comic-book shops like Forbidden Planet or St. Mark's Comics, staffed with slacker salesclerks fluent in the visual language of their generation, or club events like Sugar Babies on the Bowery, a Monday night fixture at which gay twentysomethings have begun co-opting the look.\\n\\n PROGNOSIS: Although the look is still prevalent on the street, Details magazine, the arbiter for those men swimming against the fashion mainstream, featured a fuzzy Mr. Hawke on its cover in March but fuzz-free issues in April, May and June.\\n\\n SO WHAT'S NEXT? Kristen Kish, who finds fresh faces for Stephane Sednaoui, a trendy fashion photographer and a video director, said: \\"The new look will be sleeker, real smooth and clean.

Inhabited since ancient times, Senegal was dominated in the 13th and 14th centuries by the Mandingo and Jolof empires. Portuguese traders and explorers arrived in Senegal in the early 15th century and later competed with the British, Dutch, and French for domination in Senegal. The French established a trading station at Saint-Louis in 1659 and maintained possession thereafter, except for the British enclave along the Gambia River. In the early 19th century, the French began a series of campaigns to bring the entire country under their control; the last independent sultanate surrendered in 1893. Senegal became a French colony in 1920, and Dakar became the capital of French West Africa. Senegal became a major contributor of African troops to the French armed forces. In 1946 a territorial assembly was established, with a limited electorate and advisory powers, which were gradually expanded in subsequent years. With the creation of the French Community of Nations in 1958, Senegal achieved local self-rule within the community. In 1959, with the encouragement of France, Senegal and French Sudan (now Mali) formed the Federation of Mali, which became fully independent on June 20, 1960. Senegal seceded from the federation on Aug. 20 and declared itself the Republic of Senegal. Leopold Sedar Senghor became Senegal's first president. In 1962 Prime Minister Mamdou Dia attempted a coup against the Senghor government; it failed, and Dia was imprisoned. A new constitution was subsequently adopted, strengthening the power of the presidency. Senghor retired from office in 1981 and was succeeded by Adbou Diouf. He encouraged political pluralism and has presided over a generally stable government. Diouf was elected in his own right in 1983 and reelected in 1988. Following the 1988 elections, riots broke out over charges of electoral fraud, and a state of emergency was declared. Diouf, who has taken a lead in African affairs, was reelected for the third time in 1993, but his Socialist party's legislative majority was diminished. At home, Diouf consolidated his power so well that in 1998 Parliament passed a law allowing him to become President for life. His involvement in the civil war in Guinea-Bissau, however, has caused dissension in the army. His January 1999 creation of a Senate as “upper house” to the National Assembly meant little for democracy since, with all opposition parties boycotting the election, his Socialist Party carried all 45 seats up for election. So the March 2000 presidential election was a surprise: Abdoulaye Wade of the Democratic Party (who had run four times since 1978) took 60 percent of the vote to become Senegal's third, and first non-Socialist, president. Senegal remains closely tied to France commercially, culturally, and in foreign affairs. Senegal's economy is primarily agricultural.

By Philip Toynbee. 219 pp. New York: Doubleday & Co. $3."},{"year":"1991","title":"It took Historic Annapolis, a citizen's group, and the Maryland State Legislature 11 years to restore to its original glory the mansion built in 1763 by Gov. William A. Paca, an achievement the more remarkable because the mansion had been engulfed for 69 years by a 200-room hotel and its two-acre formal garden buried beneath a Greyhound terminal. The site, at 186 Prince George Street, is now a National Historic Landmark","excerpt":"the garden was opened to the public in 1972, the house in 1976.\\n\\n The mansion, originally consisting of 37 rooms on three floors, was the first five-part-plan house built in what was then a thriving port city. Similar to Holkham Hall, in Norfolk, England, it consists of a large central block flanked by two passages - called hyphens - and two outlying wings. The keys to its esthetic success, then and now, are the pleasing proportions of the five parts and the symmetry of their disposition.\\n\\n The builders of the hotel, among other acts of desecration, added one story to both wings and one hyphen. They modified or enclosed some of the fireplaces and removed some fine architectural details, but left an encouragingly large number of original features intact, floorboards, doors and windows among them.\\n\\n Most of the documents pertaining to the construction of the house were lost in a fire at Paca's retirement home on Wye Island, on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay, but archeologists and staff members at Historic Annapolis, through study of 19th-century photographs, X-rays and carpenters' saw cuts gradually re-created the mansion.\\n\\n They were less successful with the garden, but are confident that it is mostly true to the original. Enough of the garden wall, even though it had been buried under nine feet of fill, survived to locate and establish the dimensions of the terraces. There are three levels, falling from the house to the wilderness garden. In the original garden soil, footprints of the pond - an unusual feature in gardens of the time - and the trellis bridge were found, details corroborated by a portrait of Paca painted in his garden by Charles Wilson Peale.\\n\\n As it stands today, the house, with furniture authentic to the period, and the garden, alive with 18th-century plants and Maryland natives, provide a warm insight into the life and style of a member of Maryland's 18th-century elite.\\n\\n William Paca (pronounced PAY-kah), born Oct. 31 1740, near what is now Abingdon, MD, was an extraordinary man in extraordinary times. He early on assumed a dominant role in Maryland politics: At age 28, he was elected to the Lower House of the General Assembly and, at 34, to the First Continental Congress. He was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. On Oct. 13, 1799, he died at Wye Island.\\n\\n Paca lived the American dream. He entered the College of Philadelphia, now the University of Pennsylvania, to read law, and then, at age 20, sailed for London to complete his education at the Inns of Court. It is reasonable to assume that there he developed his fondness for things aristocratic; the country house with terraced gardens, Chippendale furniture, and his conservative political philosophy. He would remain a staunch anti-Federalist until late.\\n\\n On his return to the colony, he wooed and won Mary Chew, who The Maryland Gazette said was 'an amiable and most agreeable young lady with a very considerable fortune.\\"\\n\\n Four days after the wedding, Paca bought two adjoining lots overlooking the Severn River, and, perhaps a little too full of himself, sat down immediately to design a fitting home for his distinguished bride. He came very close.\\n\\n There is a lightness when one steps into the passage that runs through the house from the huge front door on Prince George Street to the porch overlooking the garden. Here is breathing room, a wide way with a high ceiling, for a man who, like most colonists in the 1760's, was troubled by the oppression of the mother country. When doors and windows were opened, the breeze off Chesapeake Bay must have sailed through. Today, the house is air-conditioned to protect its museum-quality furniture.\\n\\n The central block is early Georgian, with four large rooms on the first floor, two on either side of the passage, and four chambers, or bedrooms, above them. They are fully furnished with tables and chairs, many of mahogany, with Sheffield silver and Nanking ware, some of it owned by the Pacas. Of special interest are two silver salt shakers dated 1763 and inscribed WMP for William and Mary, and a candelabrum dated 1788.\\n\\n Of the four rooms on the first floor, the parlor is most interesting, in part because it is completely different in character from the others. Paca refurbished the original in 1774, apparently to keep pace with his neighbors who had built five-part-plan houses similar to his. Cornices were extended, the walls painted Prussian blue and an elaborate overmantel of garlands and pineapples installed. It is like finding a pearl in a pea pod.\\n\\n The huge master's bedroom, as it was known then, the chamber above the parlor, is dominated by an oversized four-poster bed, reminding us that Paca was a giant, about 6 feet 2 inches, and tending toward corpulence, at a time when men averaged 5 feet 6.\\n\\n To help defray the cost of maintaining the house, Historic Annapolis leases the chambers on the second and third floors to visiting dignitaries, occasionally the overflow from Blair House. In 1984, when the Duke and Duchess of Kent visited Annapolis for Maryland's 350th anniversity, the Duchess slept in the master's bedroom, the duke in the smaller chamber.\\n\\n Even to the casual eye, the chamber above the dining area appears foreshortened. And it is. Paca, self-taught architect, neglected to install back stairs and had to cut away part of the chamber to include them.\\n\\n At first glance, something also appears to be amiss in the garden. Four parterres fall away from the house, two on either side of a strong main axis that terminates far below in a two-story white pavilion. But the axis is obviously not centered on the main house. It was not until recently that Barbara Paca-Steele, a descendant of William, showed that house and garden fit neatly into a grid based on a series of 3-4-5 triangles, themselves prescribed by the length of Gunter's Chain, a measuring device commonly used in the 18th century.\\n\\n For Paca, the garden was a place for entertaining guests as well as contemplating the perplexities of the crown's policies. One can imagine him in earnest conversation as he paced the walkway from house to wilderness garden, thence, perhaps, to the second floor of the pavilion from which he and his visitor could see sailing ships and fishing boats plying the bay. The parterres were for private pleasure.\\n\\n Each parterre is based on a horticultural theme: roses, flowers, boxwood and holly, the plantings hidden from the axis walk by substantial hedges. By fall, the old-fashioned roses, Rosa eglanteria and Rosa mundi, have faded, but the underplantings of linaria, sweet William and pinks are in bloom. Planting beds are edged with low boxwood.\\n\\n In the flower parterre, consisting of plats of bluegrass edged with annuals and perennials, are blue lobelia, lemon skyrocket, snapdragons, globe amaranth and delphiniums. In the 18th century, says Lucy Coggin, director of the garden, gardeners were not concerned with combining compatible colors in drifts, a technique established much later by Gertrude Jekyll. They enjoyed walking among spontaneous splashes of color.\\n\\n The most strongly geometrical of the four is the boxwood parterre, simple hedges and topiary accented by containers of lantana and jasmine.\\n\\n The holly parterre is patterned on a Persian carpet design. Its centerpiece is a Gov. William A. Paca holly, a scion of a holly planted on Wye Island. It is not known whether Paca planted the Wye Island holly, but it is so old he could have.\\n\\n Below the four parterres is Paca's pride, the wilderness garden, \\"the latest thing from England.\\" Today, it is alive with white wood aster, boneset, turtlehead and bellflowers. In the fish-shaped pond are floating heart, water snowflake and American lotus.\\n\\n As with most formal gardens, the Paca house garden is pleasing year round, the balance and proportion of the terraces and the wealth of plant textures - English holly, Foster Holly, live oak and others - providing interest even in the somber days of winter. By mid-March such flowering shrubs as winter jasmine and Bodnant viburnum begin to appear.\\n\\n The William Paca House is at 186 Prince George Street, Annapolis, MD. 21401; telephone (301) 263-5553. The garden may also be entered from 1 Martin Street. The house is open 10 to 4 Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 4 Sunday and on Monday holidays. (In February, open weekends only.) Fee: $3.50. The garden is open daily except Thanksgiving and Christmas Day 10 to 4 Monday through Saturday, noon to 4 Sunday. Fee: $2. The fee for both house and garden is $5.

Producer","excerpt":"The Garth Group of New York The Script: Ms. Giuliani: Let me tell you about my husband's record on women's rights. In his law practice, Rudy fought for split schedules and extended maternity leave so female lawyers could take care of their families without sacrificing their careers. As U.S. Attorney, he prosecuted an abortion clinic bomber who went to jail for seven years. Rudy helped establish New York City's first on-site childcare center for federal workers and he appointed the first woman in the country to head an Organized Crime Strike Force. And make no mistake about it, Rudy Giuliani is pro-choice. Accuracy: Lawyers who would know whether Mr. Giuliani fought for split schedules as a lawyer in private practice at Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler from 1977 through 1981 could not be reached for comment over the past few days. But in all other respects the commercial is accurate, though perhaps making Mr. Giuliani more central to events than he was. When he was United States Attorney, his office did prosecute the case of Dennis J. Malvasi, an abortion clinic bomber who turned himself in after John Cardinal O'Connor made a televised appeal for him to surrender. He was sentenced in 1987 to seven years in prison. His office was also one of about 10 Federal agencies that provided operating funds for Fedkids, a child care center run by a not-for-profit corporation, that opened in 1988 in 26 Federal Plaza.   And Mr. Giuliani appointed Barbara S. Jones as the first woman in the country to head a federal Organized Crime Strike Force.   Ms. Giuliani winds up her remarks affirming that her husband believes in abortion rights. In 1989, he gave several accounts of his position, before saying that while he opposed aboriton personally as a Roman Catholic, he would support and uphold abortion rights as public policy. Scorecard: The commercial is designed to rebut a commercial by Mayor David N. Dinkins that revives Mr. Giuliani's 1989 hesitations about abortion. It presents his wife, known to New Yorkers as an former anchorwoman for WPIX, to make the case that Mr. Giuliani is a progressive on women's issues. The subliminal message is that if she married him, he has to be someone to whom professional, independent women can relate.

Produced by Anatole De Grunwald and directed by Gordon Parry, for United Artists release, this amorphous little import in three episodes wastes Burgess Meredith, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Richard Murdoch and a blond newcomer named Paula Valenska.Blunted and bowdlerized, the picture does have its points. The best one, the story idea, remains uncredited, along with the misguided treatment. As, respectively, an American, a Frenchman and a Briton, traveling from Paris to London, each of the gents above encounters Miss Valenska, another pasenger, and wishfully daydreams a romantic involvement.The frst yarn is harmless, light-hearted and certainly the least woolly of the three. In it, Miss Valenska, as a photographer's model, magnetizes Mr. Aumont, a Riviera bus driver. Next we have a grave but rambling account of how Mr. Meredith, a cynical Army officer, salvages the lady from a sinister post-war bistro in Berlin. The camera work here rates a plaudit for projecting a solid atmosphere of shoddiness and futility. Better still, Miss Valenska turns in a very appealing portrait of a fallen fraulein.The third sequence, which should have been the best, is a giggly, hysterical go at satire, as Miss Valenska, a spoiled movie queen, upsets a household of sedate, middle-class Londoners.

Organized by the Mattachine Society, it was a reaction to the police harassment, random beatings and general insults that homosexuals were commonly subject to at the time. The goals of the new movement were simply safety and respectability.

Why 1840? That was when, Mr. Secord writes, the first single-breed dog shows were held in England. Not that dog painting didn't exist previously: in the 18th century, the painting of sporting dogs flourished among royalty and the landed gentry. With the rise of the middle class, having a purebred dog as a pet became a status symbol. \\"Nobody now who is anybody can afford to be followed about by a mongrel dog,\\" noted Gordon Stables in 1877, the year in which the first kennel club in England was founded. Breeders, eager to have their champions celebrated, commissioned portraits","excerpt":"the genre reached a sort of frenzied peak in the late 19th century under the inspiration and patronage of Queen Victoria. The most outstanding Victorian dog painter was undoubtedly Sir Edwin Landseer, although Mr. Secord includes a good selection of work by other notable artists, among them Charles Burton Barber, Gourlay Steell and the prolific Maud Earl. Anthropomorphism and sentimentality highlight this era, and there is much charm and amusement here.\\n\\nMr. Secord, the president of the William Secord Gallery in New York City and the founding director of the Dog Museum of America, begins with a brief survey of the dog in Continental art, recognizing and tracing the development of separate breeds from the first evidence of the domestication of the dog in the Pleistocene epoch. Mastifflike dogs are found in Assyrian limestone reliefs, Afghans and Salukis in classical Greek artifacts, bloodhounds in manuscripts of the Middle Ages. Mr. Secord then focuses on pre-Victorian England, where he is more within his element, finding examples of mastiffs, greyhounds, King Charles spaniels and foxhounds in painting and engravings. It was in 18th-century England, Mr. Secord notes, that the dog first appeared as the primary subject of a painting; however, the depictions almost always were limited to sporting dogs in performance.

The results, at their most artful and bold, have included the serious popular fiction of Thomas Harris, whose novels \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" are full of a careful measured dread. At its most snobbish and callow, the new horror has led to Bret Easton Ellis's \\"American Psycho\\": class animus as a slaughtering ground. And with the rise of so-called splatterpunk fiction, an aggressively grubby underground movement now seeks to compete with more conventional horror writers like Mr. King, Peter Straub and Dean R. Koontz. Most of this new horror fiction trades in the scariness of the seen, the notion that a reader will be frightened -- and entertained? -- by the explicit depiction of horrific acts, including murder and every sort of mutilation of the body.   The writer commonly credited with coining the term splatterpunk, the novelist David J. Schow, put it this way, \\"It's not enough to see the shadow behind the door -- people want to see what's making the shadow, what it looks like and how it comes apart.\\" In splatterpunk, ghosts have given way to serial killers; \\"boo!\\" has been replaced by \\"yuck!\\"; things don't go bump in the night -- they emit wretched, agonized howls.

Arthur Falek born March 23, 1924 in Brooklyn, NY died on November 7, 2005 from congestive heart failure. Dr. Falek was well loved for his humor and grace and will be missed by family and friends. He completed his Masters Degree in Education and a doctorate in Human Genetics in 1956 from Columbia University. In 1965 he became Director of the Human Genetics Laboratory in the Psychiatry Department of Emory University, which led to his interest in the developing field of behavior genetics. In 1967, Dr. Falek started working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP), which has made major contributions to understanding the incidence and causes of birth defects and is the foundation upon which the current National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at CDC was built. In 1979, he was awarded Georgia Mental Health Institute's Individual of the Year Award for his research into the causes of behavorial differences. At that time, he also became a national board member of the Committee on the Problems of Drug Dependency--a group devoted to understanding and combating drug abuse. Dr. Falek established the Georgia Huntington's Disease registry to track families in which HD occurred and to provide genetic counseling for those families. In the late 60's, Dr. Falek and Marjorie Guthrie, the wife of folksinger Woody Guthrie, co-founded the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease--a support group for HD families and a lobbying agency for HD research. Dr. Falek served on the boards of both the Georgia HDSA chapter and of the national organization as science advisor. For this service he won the HDSA Mason Thompson Award. In the mid-70s, Dr. Falek received the first National Institute on Drug Abuse grant to study how drugs affect the health of AIDS addicts based on their ability to fight disease both from HIV and from other opportunistic infections. This field has expanded greatly over the last two decades and led directly to a dozen international conferences on drugs and AIDS, the formation of a scientific society (Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology) and recently a Journal of NeuroImmune Pharmacology--all of which Dr. Falek was involved in starting. For his work on the effects of illicit drugs on AIDS progression, Arthur Falek received The Medal of the City of Paris, awarded in May 1990 by Mayor Jacques Chirac. In 1980, Dr. Falek initiated the Fetal Alcohol Surveillance project in Georgia. This project was one of the first to identify the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and to describe the behavioral characteristics of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and has contributed to the prevention of this common disorder. While at Emory, Arthur Falek taught several generations of medical students and was mentor to a large number of doctoral students and faculty members who went on to carve out their own distinguished careers in human genetic research, psychiatry and substance abuse. In addition to his academic excellence, Dr. Falek was well known for his community contributions including his service on numerous boards including the Jewish Family and Career Services in Atlanta","excerpt":"the Georgia Fetal Alcohol Task Force; Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies; the Robischer Society, and a myriad of other community service organizations in Atlanta. Dr. Falek was active in many local, national and international Jewish organizations including the Jewish Educational Loan Fund, where he was President and Chairman of the Board; Jewish Family and Career Services of Atlanta; and at Hebrew University where he helped to establish The Sheinfeld Center for Behavior Genetics. Dr. Falek was also an advisor to Hillel on the Emory campus. Dr. Falek is survived by his wife Rhoda, his children Linda and husband Andrew Aymes; James Falek and wife Wendy Tanson; six grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, his sister Nina Epstein and his caregivers Juanita ''Christy'' Bowen and Rosa Parpolov.

In that case it would be a frightful bore.What makes this Warner Brothers film worthy of attention is that, by inadvertence, it is a spoof of all the spy movies of the last 20 years or so. The story line is a classic of scrambled incredibility that surely cannot be meant to be untangled. And the actors, for their part, do not make the slightest pretense of trying.Instead, Christopher Plummer, Yul Brynner, Romy Schneider and Trevor Howard, professionals all, have an immense amount of quiet hilarity with the stereotype roles in which they have been cast. There is the Agent, brighter and slyer than his multiple masters","excerpt":"the German Baron, not so evil as he seems despite his monocle; the seductive (of course she's seductive) Countess; and the Englishman with you know what kind of an upper lip.These actors, of course, are far too experienced to play the movie for outright laughs.

Think of German films, and you think of heavy and often depressing themes, stories of pain, loss and the burdens of being alive. When the director Helmut Dietl offered his marvelous 1991 comedy \\"Schtonk\\" to foreign distributors, he complained that trying to sell a German comedy was like trying to sell Swedish spaghetti: it seemed a contradiction in terms.         Since then, however, the tables have turned. The most widely respected German directors, figures like Wim Wenders and Volker Schlondorff, are still producing  serious feature films that critics, if not large audiences, admire. But now a younger generation of directors have emerged and, at least in terms of mass appeal, left their elders in the dust. They are making a kind of film new to Germany, the relationship comedy -- light, funny, fast-paced, modestly erotic and enormously popular. At least a dozen have been released over the last few years. Nearly all have turned a profit, and several have been big hits.

Yet there are times when the presence of animals in art is strong enough almost to make a trend. It's the thesis of Richard Flood, an art critic and an editor of the magazine Artforum, that such a thing happened in the romantic movement of the early 19th century, when animals frequented the work of such artists as the animalier sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye, the painters Eugene Delacroix and (in the United States) George Catlin. In the romantic movement, with its expressive emphasis on the personal and the rebellious, the beast was viewed sympathetically as a wild, natural force outside the staid confines of civilization, symbolizing the side of the human personality that wants out from society's restrictions.

It is a silent British picturization of Eden Phillpot's novel, \\"Widecombe Fair,\\" and in the course of the tale one sees the fair in action—men throwing wooden balls at stakes topped by cocoanuts and other typically British amusements.After the jazz round-up and the screen musical comedy fever, it is quite refreshing to gaze upon something so ingenuous as this tale, which with all its old-fashioned ideas has sufficient interest to cause one to wish to see the end.Usually country squires are either bullies or snobs, but the squire of Mr. Phillpots's story is a sympathetic person, who, however, is much perturbed about money matters. When young Smerdon, a toiler in the fields, tells the squire he is in love with his daughter and that the girl loves him, too, the squire consents to the marriage of the young persons, and in spite of his straitened financial circumstances he signalizes the event by a banquet that is the talk of the neighborhood. One old farmer declares:\\"'E's been a good squire and us don't want to be 'ard on 'um.\\"With the exception of some hard-faced creditors and bibulous bailiffs, everybody wishes the Squire weil, but charming as he is, his London friends refuse to let him have another penny.A widow, who is not blind to the Squire's prepossessing appearance, solves the problem and, while her method may be somewhat deceitful, one does not begrudge her wedding the Squire in the end.It is a legend of Blackslade, the Squire's heavily mortgaged manor, that one of the ancestors was a miser who buried his treasure. Moreover, it is reported that on more than one occasion the ghost of this fellow stalked the countryside and frightened people. The widow suggests to the Squire's daughter and her husband that they trot out a ghost, bury some treasure, to be supplied by this widow, who is wealthy, and save the homestead. The bridegroom dons a nineteenth century coat with a cape, a tri-corner hat and a beard. The last named \\"prop\\" was cut from the tail of old Dobbin, whom the Squire would not destroy, but as ghosts only appear in the dark it serves the purpose admirably.This Ghost of Widecombe Vale soon causes consternation among those returning in an unsteady fashion from the fair and the ale houses. One red-nosed person has the temerity to throw a cocoanut at the ghost, and the ghost being much more substantial than the frightened man thought, is furious over such treatment from a mere mortal. So the spectre gives chase and aims several cocoanuts at the daring individual, who, when narrating his exciting experience later, says:\\"Aye, I see'd him gashly white and gibbering.\\"Besides the momentous period dealing with the ghost, there are a number of amusing passages devoted to five men riding on one horse to the fair. Subsequently there is a flash-back of a story told by one of the riders, in which the skeleton of a mare with half a dozen human skeletons on her bones is perceived wabbling along.There are some silly comedy ideas, virtually nothing but buffoonery, which might easily be excluded. The director also is often too abrupt in depicting the actions of characters, and there are periods when the camera makes the movements of the players absurdly fast.Wyndham Standing gives a restrained and thoroughly pleasing performance as the Squire. Marguerite Allen, an extraordinarily attractive brunette, is appealing as the daughter. William Freshman is a little too well shaved and too pale to impress one as a farm hand. Violet Hopson is acceptable as the widow. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Ghost of Widecombe Vale.

Perhaps the most serious objections the other tenth will have are that \\"The Docks of New York\\" is a little too long and that it has an anti-climax. The picture as a whole is good, however, with able acting and occasional bits of exceptional directing.The story, briefly, deals with a stoker who has just one night in town before sailing. He saves a girl who tries to commit suicide, then visits a saloon. Later in the evening the girl whom he has rescued and he discuss love, finally deciding that they may as well get married. The next morning he goes away on his ship","excerpt":"the girl is arrested for stealing. However, the stoker has a fight with his chief, and as the ship passes the waterfront he jumps off and swims ashore. He goes to jail; the girl promises to wait for him.Were it not for the preposterous ending, \\"The Docks of New York\\" would take a higher rank. Had its conclusion been the stoker's leaving in the morning it would have been much better than it is. But the desire for a happy ending has survived.Josef von Sternberg has directed the play with tact and with an eye to minute details. There are few spots which do not ring true. When the girl jumps into the water the camera catches it all by reflection. She leaps from the pier and a second or so later the splash ruffles the surface of the water.George Bancroft gives a good performance as a blustering, carefree stoker with but one night on shore. Betty Compson plays the part of Sadie well. Baclanova, of course, is the villainess—or at least as near an approach to it as there is in the picture. Gustav von Seyffertitz has only the small part of Hymn Book Harry.On the stage Paul Ash glorifies \\"Blossoms.\\" There are elaborate springtime sets, and such persons as Arthur Ball, the Foster Girls, Sammy Lewis, Patty Moore and George Dewey Washington take part.
