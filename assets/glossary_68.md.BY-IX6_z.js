Also good are the seafood chili with squid, sausage, shrimp and beans, and the shellfish platter that holds scallops, shrimp, salmon pastrami, smoked trout and more.

JAMAICA  Night of Doo-Wop Recalls Rock's Own Cool Youth    Courage -- five teen-age a cappella singers from the La Guardia High School of Music and the Arts -- will perform at Junior High School 8 on Tuesday.    Ken (Spider) Webb, a KISS-FM deejay, will also be on stage to answer questions from the audience about the music business.   The singers say they chose their group's name because of the courage required to do five-part harmony in a world obsessed by hip-hop. They specialize in doo-wop but also perform rhythm-and-blues and pop as well as their own songs.   While Courage has performed at the Apollo, its members are looking forward to a show at a junior high school. \\"To me, it means giving something back to the community,\\" said Danny Nieves, who at 19 is the group's oldest member. \\"We all grew up in rough neighborhoods, so it's like giving back.\\"   The program is part of a series of events for families sponsored by the Jamaica Arts Center. Future events in the series include workshops on how to make musical instruments out of gourds, a traditional African and Latin craft. Another performance by Courage will take place on Jan. 25 at Public School 15 in Red Hook.   Junior High School 8, 108-35 167th Street; 7 P.M. Wednesday; free; (718) 658-7400.

THREE OPERAS  Three new American operas, still works in progress, are sung by musicians from American Opera Projects, Encompass New Opera Theater and the Manhattan School of Music. The raciest of the three, ''Dream President,'' by Jennifer Griffith, draws on her own erotic reveries about a real-life American leader.  Manhattan School of Music, Broadway at 122nd Street; 2:30 p.m.; $20.    ROCKY BALLET  It's the Colorado Ballet's third trip to the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, and the company is bringing a big program: ''Rachmaninoff Second'' is choreographed by the former Bolshoi dancer Konstantin Uralsky, and ''Dracula'' has the count slinking and skulking. The evening ends on a rowdy note with ''Vital Sensations,'' set to music by Tito Puente, the drum-and-bass producer Roni Size/Reprazent and others.  Whitman Hall, Brooklyn College, Flatbush; 2 p.m.; $35.    IRANIAN CONFAB  Once every year or so, a self-described supergroup of four Iranian musicians swings through New York. While the group's moniker, Masters of Persian Music, may be immodest, they prove their chops on the plucked lute and the spike fiddle on their new CD, ''Faryad'' (World Village/Harmonia Mundi USA).  Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street; 7 p.m.; $30 to $50. (Also next Sunday.)    Monday 3|7    THE RETURN OF DISCO  The New York-based band Ambulance Ltd. has a moody, almost ethereal guitar-pop sound, but its members enjoy messing with standard pop song formulas. Tonight they open for the Louisville, Ky.-based guys of VHS or Beta. As they showed on the 2004 album ''Night on Fire,'' they prefer their songs classically constructed: they explore the most structured pop, drawing from early new wave and its kissing cousin, straight-up disco.  Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side; 8 p.m.; $16. (VHS or Beta also plays on Tuesday.)    POLI-SCI DANCE  ''Dancing on the Battlements,'' a panel discussion led by the Brooklyn Academy of Music's executive producer, Joseph V. Melillo, brings together choreographers like Ibrahim Quraishi from Pakistan and Patricia Hoffbauer from Brazil for a conversation about the impact of the Patriot Act on those who work in a global discipline.  New School for Social Research, 66 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village; 6:30 p.m.; $8.    NEW ON DVD: HEROES AND THE MOLE  ''Unlikely Heroes'' (Koch Vision, $24.98), narrated by Ben Kingsley, tells the stories of seven people from seven countries who, working alone, fought Nazism. ''The Mole: The Complete First Season'' (Red Distribution, $19.98) mixes paranoia with reality-show challenges, and puts the show's host (and current CNN anchor) Anderson Cooper in his most non-newsworthy role to date.    Tuesday 3|8    LUNCH ACCOMPANIMENT  Once a month, Midtown Manhattan gets a lunchtime concert on the Central Synagogue's incredible 4,345-pipe organ. Today's repertory: John Scott, the organist and choirmaster of St. Thomas Church, plays works by Bach, Franck and Liszt.  652 Lexington Avenue, at 55th Street; 12:30 p.m.; free    THE IDES OF MARCH ARE COME  With the disastrous ''Dracula'' a distant memory, the Belasco Theater begins again with a clean slate. Tonight, previews begin for Broadway's ''Julius Caesar,'' starring Denzel Washington as Brutus.  111 West 44th Street; 8 p.m.; $51.25 to $101.25.    JAZZ FOR READING  The Lady Liberty Jazz All-Stars aren't a groovy group of femmes; they are a group of well-known musicians, directed by the saxophonist Vincent Herring, that takes its name from the Lady Liberty Educational Alliance, which provides free reading tutors for students struggling with literacy. At tonight's benefit, the big band, stocked with vibraphone and horn, backs the singer Pamela Luss.  Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall; 8 p.m.; $45.    MAKING SENSE  Bach, Julius Caesar and jazz not enough? If you're still looking for something to do today, check out Nonsense NYC, a weekly e-mail events list run by the Brooklyn resident Jeff Stark. More of an enthusiast than a publicist, he skews toward independent, strange and inexpensive productions. Soon the weekly e-mail service will add a text-messaging based system for delivery via phone.  Sign up at: www.nonsensenyc.com.    Wednesday 3|9    FUNNY PAGES  The Cupcake series of readings by women tonight features two graphic novelists, whose work will be projected while being read. Megan Kelso's mid-90's comic book ''Girlhero'' was a sassy feminist treatise; for the last few years, she's been serializing a long work called ''Artichoke Tales.'' Ariel Bordeaux has a similar story; she now delivers irregular installments of ''Raisin Pie.''  Lolita, 266 Broome Street, Lower East Side; 7:30 p.m.; free.    MORE DOUBT  Tonight's the first preview of ''Doubt,'' the Catholic-school drama that had a limited Off Broadway run and was snapped up for a transfer to Broadway. The highly praised cast of four, including Cherry Jones, has come along to the new address.  Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; 8 p.m.; $26.25 to $90.25.    CRAFTING TO THE DEATH  Going up against tonight's South Park season premiere; a new show, ''Craft Corner Deathmatch.'' In a chain-link cage reminiscent of Comedy Central's ''Battlebots,'' tonight's first challenge pits two craft enthusiasts in a competition to create brooches out of candy. A panel of three judges reviews the on-the-spot creations as the audience screams.  Style Network; 10 p.m.    MOOD MUSIC  This lineup of bands could serve as an introduction to emo music -- it will cheer you up if you're feeling down, although the opposite may be equally true. Rainer Maria's strength has always been its beautiful vocal harmonies; Autodrone sounds like New Order without the techno fascination but with a great singer; Parts & Labor brings a bit of aggressive noise to the scene.  Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side; 7 p.m.; $12.    Thursday 3|10    VINCENT'S EVIL  At random locations around the city, you might catch one of those ubiquitous fire-code-mandated ''Exit'' signs that's been altered so it spells out ''Evil'' instead. If so, you're looking at an older project by Vincent Mazeau (he makes them but does not install them), whose new exhibition of everyday items like picnic tables ''frozen'' under fake icicles and snow has just opened. And his ''Castle'' is a looming 12-foot tower of 25 icy shipping pallets.  Lehmann Maupin, 540 West 26th Street, Chelsea; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; free. (Through April 9.)    SOUTHERN VÉRITÉ  ''Sheriff'' is a new full-length documentary by Daniel Kraus, the director of ''Jefftowne,'' a 1997 portrait of a hard-drinking shoplifting enthusiast with Down's syndrome -- not exactly the ideal spokesman for people with disabilities. ''Sheriff'' follows Ronald E. Hewett, chief lawman of the very rural Brunswick County, N.C., over four years, as he investigates the murder of an elderly lawyer and other crimes, in an area where he's related to perhaps a full third of the population.  Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, East Village; 9 p.m.; $9. (Through March 15.)    NEW ON CD: SARAH LEE GUTHRIE  John Digweed's ''Fabric 20'' (Fabric, $17.98) is a pared-down D.J. set by a number of emerging nightclub artists, including D.J. Rasoul and Angel Alanis. Sarah Lee Guthrie (daughter of Arlo) has a new folk-rock collaboration with Johnny Irion called ''Exploration'' (New West, $17.98) -- sort of like Gillian Welch after therapy. The Kills' highly anticipated new album, ''No Wow'' (Rough Trade/RCA, $13.98), lends itself to lots of anti-hype jokes, but its music is all murky, sexy rock.    Friday 3|11    THREE PIECES  Relache, an eight-member Philadelphia-based new music group, will be performing, for the first time in New York, three commissioned works, including Amy Denio's ''Three Pieces,'' which takes a lighthearted approach to noise, atonality and Indian raga. The other works are by Leslie Burrs and Shafer Mahoney.  The Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street; 8:30 p.m.; $21, $18 for students and 65+.    NEW FILMS: LESS PASSION  The comedy ''Mail Order Wife'' pits a documentary filmmaker against a mail-order bride shopper over the issue of the young woman's future (Dada, at the Angelika). Danny Boyle's ''Millions'' puts a ton of cash in the hands of little Liverpudlians -- and a lot of production budget into special effects(Fox Searchlight, limited). And, just in time for Easter, Mel Gibson has a new version of ''The Passion of the Christ,'' called, in best D.J. style, ''The Passion Recut.'' The cutting, paradoxically, results in less onscreen blood and guts. (Newmarket, national).    MIAMI COLLAGE  Saturday is the last day of an exhibition by Gean Moreno, a Miami painter and collagist having his first solo showing in New York. His work looks like simple (if overwhelming) psychedelia at first, but on closer examination little details make themselves known: a fabric pattern, a bit of an advertisement, a 70's-style iconic product silhouette.  Derek Eller Gallery, 526 West 25th Street, Chelsea; 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; free.    Saturday 3|12    FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT  The New York Underground Film Festival began on Wednesday with the premiere of ''The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things,'' Asia Argento's adaptation of the JT LeRoy book; on Sunday, it'll show the actor Crispin Hellion Glover's incredibly disturbing exploration of race, called ''What Is It?'' But tonight at 10:30 is the world premiere of the New Orleans-based director Ryan Trecartin's ''A Family Finds Entertainment,'' a video which is interrupted by live performers in the audience; it's about friends rescuing a boy from death.  Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, East Village; for a full schedule, www.nyuff.com. (Through March 15.)    JAM QUARTET  Still only in his mid-20's, the saxophonist Marcus Strickland has carved out a reputation for playing tight, gleeful jazz with his quartet. They play two sets tonight, with Mr. Strickland switching between soprano and tenor at will.  Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village; 9 and 10:30 p.m.; $15.    GOOPY WALL ART  Francine Spiegel's assemblages are gruesome and funny; in ''Dark Side of the Wall,'' deflated Mylar balloons are used as a canvas for messy paint and inkjet photos -- of naked women, covered in mud, and wrestling or rocking out. Her specialty is controlled sloppiness, and she stops just short of icky.  Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, off Rivington Street, Lower East Side; noon to 6 p.m.; free.

From ancient times a group of petty principalities in the southern part of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca, maintained extensive ties of maritime commerce throughout Southeast Asia. The early Malay states were Hindu, under Indian influence; with the rise of the Kingdom of Malacca in the 15th century, conversion to Islam was widespread. European influence in the Spice Islands began in the 16th century; the Portuguese, initially dominant, gave way to the Dutch, who seized Malacca in 1641. British influence grew during the 18th century, with the founding of a trading settlement at Penang in 1789. Singapore was founded in 1819, and the Dutch ceded Malacca to Britain in 1824. By a series of treaties in the late 19th century, the various Malay states became British protectorates; Britain controlled the entire southern peninsula after 1909. Under British rule, commercial tin mining and the establishment of extensive rubber plantations led to the importation of many Indian and Chinese laborers; eventually ethnic Chinese dominated Malaya's domestic economy. In the 19th century, Great Britain also gained a dominant position in northern Borneo. (Borneo is divided among Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia.) Japan overran Malaya by February 1942. Following World War II, the various Malay states (except Singapore) organized into a federation, which replaced the confusing prewar regime of federated and unfederated protectorates. A Communist rebellion disrupted the country throughout the early 1950's. Following the suppression of the Communist movement, elections were held in mid-1955 for a home-rule government. The elections brought the Alliance party of Tungku Abdul Rahman to power, and the Federation of Malaya became independent in 1957. The nation expanded on Sept. 16, 1963, with the creation of Malaysia, incorporating the Federation of Malaya as well as Singapore and the former British colonies of North Borneo (thereafter called Sabah) and Sarawak. Singapore seceded from Malaysia in 1965 and became an independent nation. Malaysia has been ruled since 1981 by the coalition government of Mahathir Mohamad, who has transformed the country from an agriculture-based economy to one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia. The country sustained annual growth rates of 8 percent through the 1980's. In 1995 Malaysia received $5.8 bil. in foreign direct investment, the most in East Asia. The Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 hit Malaysia very hard as the currency and stockmarkets declined steeply. Facing Malaysia's first recession in 13 years, Mahathir announced that the free market system had proven a failure and dismissed his finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim in Sept. 1998. Arrested and beaten by police, Anwar faced charges of sodomy and corruption in a nightmare trial. In April 1999 he was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison. His wife, Azizah Ismail announced a new opposition National Justice Party. But when elections were suddenly called in November, her new party took only five of the 193 seats, as Mahathir's National Front carried 148. Mahathir announced in 2002, that after 21 years, he would resign effective Oct. 25; deputy P.M. Abdullah Badawi has been groomed to succeed.

By now, the dramatic personal story of this popular Spanish tenor, who turns 50 this year, looms far larger than his artistry. While his Three Tenors colleague Luciano Pavarotti contends with a weight problem, Mr. Carreras has conquered leukemia. He has turned his struggle into impressive activism as the president of a foundation to combat the disease. That he is performing at all is a personal triumph. This lends his singing, even in a breezy Neapolitan song, a quality of gravitas that audiences respond to. His fans at Carnegie Hall, who last had a chance to hear Mr. Carreras in recital four years ago, were tireless and vociferous in their adulation.         That said, Mr. Carreras's singing is in a sad state, and some of this is self-inflicted from years of pushing his voice beyond its essentially lyrical resources. His program, \\"Songs of Opera Composers,\\" should have been well suited to his current capability, and there were passages where the mellifluous, sweet-toned, ringing tenor voice of his prime seemed intact. But overall the singing was patchy, the legato was rough, the pianissimo passages were breathy,  and the top notes were forced and constricted.

Few individuals have meant so much to an institution as has Vera List to the New School. Her intellectual breadth, wisdom and imagination have touched virtually every aspect of this university-its academic programs and divisions, identification with the arts, faculty support and endowed lectureships, facilities, student fellowships and services, and its commitment to human rights. A woman with rare and unique gifts, Vera List stands out promenitly in the tradition of bold people whose courage, moral fortitude, and commitment have built and sustained this institution, and who has inspired all of us to do better. We have lost a priceless friend. We extend our deepest sympathy to daughter Carol and Eric Schwartz, daughter Olga and George Mack, and daughter Viki Laura List, her grandchildren, and her greatgrandchildren. Philip Scaturro Chairman, Board of Trustees Bob Kerrey, President New School University     LIST - Vera. The Jewish Museum Trustees and staff mourn the passing of Life Trustee Vera Glaser List, who, with her husband Albert, were longtime supporters of the Museum, creating a wing and sculpture court in 1963. Mrs. List held the position of Vice Chair, Chair and Honorary Chair of the Board, and for over 30 years sponsored a yearly graphic commissioning program for contemporary artists who created works relating to the celebration of the Jewish New Year. She was a champion of all efforts to marry contemporary art with Jewish culture, and supported for many years the work of contemporary master craftsman Moshe Zabari and Ludwig Wolpert, whose Judaic silvermaking studios were located in The Jewish Museum. Her creativity, generosity and commitment were a driving force of the Museum for many years, and we extend our heartfelt condolences to her three daughters and their families. Joan Rosenbaum, Director Susan Lytle Lipton, Chairman John Vogelstein, President     LIST-Vera. Hadassah, The Women's Zionest Organization of America, Inc. mourns the passing of Vera Glaser List, beloved wife of Albert List, of Blessed Memory. She was the devoted mother of Olga and George Mack, Carol and Eric Schwartz, Viki Laura List, and JoAnn List Levinson, of Blessed Memory. She was the cherished grandmother of 12 grandchildren and 23 great-grandchildren. As a Guardian of Zion, Vera was a generous benefactor of Hadassah who was devoted to Israel and the Jewish people. Her legacy will live on through divisionary projects she supported at the Hadassah Medical Organization and the many contributions she made to other institutions. She will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved her. May her memory be for a blessing. Bonnie Lipton, President     LIST-Vera Glaser. The Jewish Theological Seminary community mourns the death of Vera Glaser List, who with her late husband, Albert, endowed JTS's undergraduate school, Albert A.

She is survived by her daughters, Viki Laura List, Olga Mack (George) and Carol Schwartz (Eric)","excerpt":"11 grandchildren; and 23 great-grandchildren; and also predeceased by a daughter, Jo List Levinson, and a grandchild.

Briefly, Otto Schenk's production adheres closely to Wagner's stage directions and scenic descriptions, keeping the story in a traditionally conceived world of gods and mortals of various stripes. Gunther Schneider-Siemssen's sets and projections strive to combine naturalism and mythical grandeur. And the company did not stint on either detail (you could probably make a sword after watching this \\"Siegfried\\") or spectacle (the ending of \\"Gotterdammerung\\" is appropriately cataclysmic).   Although Brian Large's video direction captures something of the production's dimension, this \\"Ring\\" is far more magical in the house than on the small screen. Mr. Large's penchant for close-ups, in particular, has drawbacks.

From April 24, when Franco, the Brooklyn-born pitcher, joined the relief corps of the Cincinnati Reds, to July 18, when Pendleton rapped three hits in his first game as the St. Louis Cardinals' third baseman, those young players added luster to the season and left people wondering what they could do over the course of a full season.   Stone, one of 15 children of a Missouri family, batted .362 and stole 27 bases in 51 games with the Philadelphia Phillies and now he is their left fielder. Gladden, hitting .397 for Phoenix in the Pacific Coast League before being recalled when Jack Clark was injured, batted .351 and registered a team-high and team- rookie-record 31 stolen bases in 86 games for the San Francisco Giants.

Even the polka-dotted pigs and the horses as sleek as seals -- plodding and prancing under the circus's heated, intimate tent -- must have been sent from heaven just for this show. But since it does take place in a tent, there are some considerations -- like dressing warmly, to pick up the tickets at the outdoor ticket booth and for standing in the unheated rest-room area (which lacks any changing counters). Also try to arrive early: latecomers will not be seated during the first five minutes of the performance. Once you are inside, strollers can be checked. And when the 15-minute intermission arrives, it's just enough time to buy the $2 hot dogs and $10 neon circus caps. Showtime is 6:30 to about 8:45, and ticket prices range from $20 to $45, with children under two free. All seats offer memorable views.\\nTwo Boots Restaurant \\n37 Avenue A \\n(Between 1st and 2d Streets)\\n212-505-2276\\n514 Second Street, Brooklyn \\n(Park Slope)\\n718-499-3253\\nRecommended ages: Toddlers and up \\n\\n Both Two Boots restaurants take the crayons-and-butcher-paper children's dining experience a few steps farther: crayons are served in tins, coloring books are passed out like menus and young guests are treated like royal highnesses. A good idea is to sit in a booth (at either location), so children can sprawl outm infants can doze and coats have a place to hide. The Creole-Italian menu, offers, among a few kids' entrees, a \\"pizza face\\" for $4.50 decorated with -- hurray -- vegetables. While parents imbibe wine, beer or other beverages, children can spin the stools at the counter, supervise the pizza chef or practice manual dexterity at the jukebox. If all else fails, hop the kids on the coin-operated (quarters) ride outside the front door. For comfort, sassy seats, bumper seats and high chairs are available. No credit cards or reservations are accepted, however. In Manhattan, Two Boots is open Tuesday through Sunday, noon to midnight.

But it's the sentimental-sounding piped-in organ music that sweeps everyone on. Lines do develop, moreso on Sundays, though the wait, promises Sal Napolitano, the operator, is no more than 15 to 20 minutes on excellent-weatherdays. Otherwise, it's short, if not at all. While in line, parents can take turns sitting on the benches outside or running over to the nearby playground with the more restless kids. Strollers are parked inside the carousel once you're on it -- and you can purchase as many of the 75-cent tickets as you want. The 57 vertically-moving horses are saddled with seat belts and the two blazing Roman chariots are cushioned and right for holding babies. Popcorn, sodas and balloons are on sale; rest rooms are close by, and bring the videocam recorder or camera for photo ops. Each ride is three minutes, at 12 miles an hour. The hours are 10:30 to 4:30 every day; after Thanksgiving, weekends only. It is closed when there is rain or it is below freezing.\\nHarold and the Purple Crayon \\nPromenade Theatre\\n2162 Broadway\\n212-677-5959\\nRecommended ages: Five to eight \\nThrough January 10 \\n\\n The spirited songs in this virtually dialogue-free, one-hour show carry along the story of feisty, cranky Harold, his magical crayon and his effervescent purple friends. Presented by Theatreworks/USA, who specialize in children's musicals, it is based on the book of the same name, where Harold creates, with his handy giant-sized crayon, the world the way he'd like it. And if you and the kids don't know too much about Harold, it would be wise to become acquainted with the book beforehand, for Harold is no ordinary bloke. Some children in the audience may indeed grow restive before the performance ends -- there is no intermission -- but most of them do remain respectfully enthralled. No refreshments are sold, and tickets are $13 to $16.\\nCharging Bull \\nBowling Green (Lower Broadway)\\nRecommended ages: Four and up \\n\\n Despite the ferocious look of Arturo di Modica's bronze bull, it is actually tame enough to climb up on for picture-taking and a little fantasy rodeo riding. He'll be there indefinitely -- just be prepared to walk up a long flight of stairs if you take the Number 6 subway line to Bowling Green station.\\nBook Illustrations\\nKimberly Gallery\\n112 Mercer Street\\n(212) 274-1741\\nRecommended ages: 5 and up\\nThrough December\\n\\n This year-old Manhattan gallery exclusively for children's-book illustrations is exhibiting some original watercolors by Diane De Groat for such books as \\"The Little Rabbit's Loose Tooth,\\" and \\"Be Brave Baby Rabbit.\\" Hanging next to the delicate painting are Ms. De Groat's notes on how the artworks came about and how the editors of the books helped shape them, too.

GREENWICH VILLAGE Elongated Canine In Search of Same    As Adrian Milton tells it:    Damon and Pythias were twin dachshunds. They were owned by a wealthy couple. When Pythias died, Damon was distraught. He started urinating over the oriental rugs in the house. The owners could not control him and even locked him in the oven when they went out.    When Mr. Milton, a freelance writer, heard about this, he offered to take Damon home to live with him. And off Damon went.   But every time Damon would go out with Mr. Milton and see another dachshund, he would howl.   Rather than getting another dog, Mr. Milton decided to start the Dachshund Friendship Club to find other people with dachshunds to be playmates for Damon.   Now the club even has an event -- the Dachshund Octoberfest.    Next Saturday, everyone can bring his or her dachshund and meet in Washington Square Park to play with Damon (who is now 8 and happy). More than 500 other dachs hunds are expected to show up.   There will also be applications to adopt a dachshund from the Dachshund Rescue League.

It wanted the course, for which students had been clamoring, to be up and running when Business Week magazine compiled its 1990 graduate business school rankings, says Harry L. Davis, deputy dean of M.B.A. programs. (It worked -- graduates \\"raved\\" about the new program, Business Week says, and Chicago moved from No. 11 in 1988 to No. 4 on the 1990 list, in the magazine's Oct. 29 issue.)   The University of Maryland hired a finance professor with a hefty reputation and an equally hefty salary. \\"If it weren't for the rankings we would have spent that money on two lesser-known scholars rather than one flashy one,\\" said Mercie Hardie Coogan, Maryland's director of public relations -- who admits that she was hired to move Maryland into the rankings. (No luck yet.) Paying $200 More     Last year, the 1,200 M.B.A. candidates at the University of Texas at Austin's business school voted to pay $200 more a year in fees. The resulting $240,000 is now financing four new guidance counselors, a new admissions director, three new staff members and five new computers in the placement office, a career counseling program and an expanded orientation session. It seems the Texas M.B.A. students were horrified when their school, which is almost always considered among the top 20 business schools on any survey, did not make Business Week's in 1988.   \\"There's no question the 1988 rankings were the catalyst for these changes, and that everyone is hoping we fare better in subsequent lists,\\" said Claudia Woody, an assistant dean. (Texas made it -- No. 18 this year.)    All this is a bit bemusing to John A. Byrne, the senior writer who dreamed up the Business Week survey. Themyriad business-school surveys conducted until then had asked professors and deans to evaluate one another's institutions.   \\"What we wanted was a customer satisfaction index for business schools, one that recognized that the customers are the people who pay $20,000 a year for their educations and the companies who hire them, not the deans of other schools,\\" Mr. Byrne said.    So he asked 3,000 graduating business students at 23 schools regularly ranked among the top on traditional surveys, asking them to rate the quality of the teaching, the curriculum, the environment and the placement office: 1,245 M.B.A.'s replied. He also asked some 265 corporate recruiters who had recently visited a third or more of the 23 schools. They were asked to name the schools that provide the graduates with thebest skills in areas ranging from general management to finance and marketing","excerpt":"112 replied. The final list was based on a compilation and tabulation of both sets of responses.    The result was tantamount to heresy in business-school and corporate circles. Northwestern's Kellogg School ranked highest. The Universities of North Carolina and Michigan ranked above Stanford, which came in at an unheard-of No. 9. Columbia, Chicago, New York University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology all placed below the top 10. Yale squeaked in as No. 19, and the University of Pittsburgh's generally well regarded Katz School was not even included in the survey.    The list landed like a bombshell, and low-ranked schools were sent scurrying to discredit the survey. Professors at Columbia and M.I.T. rushedinto print with treatises carving up its methodology. Ms. Coogan wrote a tongue-only-partly-in-cheek letter to her peers at other also-rans to see if they would band together to \\"capitalize on our otherness.\\" When that met with lackluster response, Maryland quickly sponsored a survey ranking schools by quality of research -- one of Maryland's strengths.   Deans tried to explain why students or recruiters downgraded their schools. \\"Our students command really high salaries and recruiters don't like to pay top dollar,\\" said D. John Roberts, who until Sept. 1 was associate dean for academic affairs at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business (which, apparently, has partly overcome that problem -- it's up to No. 5 this year). Richard R. West, dean of N.Y.U.'s Stern School of business (slightly up, from No. 18 to No. 17), suggested that \\"New York schools like N.Y.U. and Columbia suffer because New Yorkers love to trash themselves.\\"    H. J. (Jerry) Zoffer, Katz's dean, even has reasons for why his school, which was included in this year's survey but did not make the top 20, would inevitably have a poor showing. Katz gives an M.B.A. degree in 11 consecutive months, rather than two years, so its students were in the middle of their last term when the questionnaires went out in the spring.   \\"They were facing exam and job pressures, they were still in the placement cycle, they were in a state of disrepair, so their happiness quotient was bound to be low,\\" Dean Zoffer said.   Still, by his own admission, he lobbied intensively to be included in the survey -- if only to prevent the competition from saying his school did not even merit consideration.   Dean Zoffer and a growing number of other deans have finally acknowledged that they can neither kill the Business Week survey nor reduce its effect. Indeed, the Business Week rankings are now entrenched. That November 1988 issue in which the first set was printed was the magazine's best-sellingissue that year. Letters to Mr. Byrne and to Mark Morrison, the assistant managing editor to whom he reports, continued to flood in from students, deans and others -- both condemning the survey and lauding it.    The continuing popularity prompted Business Week to publish \\"Business Week's Guide to the Best Business Schools,\\" which professed to profile the top 40 M.B.A. programs. And, it prompted the magazine to make the survey a biannual event. Stiff Upper Lips     Academia has not been the same since. There are some stiff upper lips to be found, like that of Glen Urban, deputy dean of M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management (15th-ranked in 1988, 11th this year), who said recently, \\"The Business Week survey didn't prompt us to change anything because we didn't believe any of the things it said.\\"   But stoics are far outnumbered by activists who, much as they detest the survey, want to make a decent showing on it.    They know that applications to Cornell's Johnson School jumped 50 percent after its fifth-place ranking in 1988 (this year, it is No. 16 -- will it hurt?); that the University of North Carolina's No. 8 ranking (down to 12 now) resulted in a 30 percent increase in the number of recruiters coming to campus; that Duke University's alumni donations increased when it placed 10th (now down to 13th). In other words, the stakes are just too high to ignore.    The competition has become ugly. Many deans, refusing to be quoted, suggest that other deans are somehow persuading students to give their schools unearned high marks to preserve the value of their degrees. But Mr. Byrne insists that the questionnaires can filter out any such student \\"cheerleading.\\"    He has been less successful in quieting deans of business schools and public relations people. \\"Not a week goes by when I don't receive a packageof videos or a visit,\\" he said. \\"I feel like a politician being lobbied by special-interest groups.\\"    Even those who won't admit to caring are cultivating John Byrne. Professor Roberts of Stanford, for example, could not be more clear: \\"Improving in the rankings is not our objective; improving as a school is.\\" Yet several Stanford people have flown to New York to discuss the rankings with Mr. Byrne, and the school has assigned an associate dean to \\"help Business Week make the survey more useful,\\" Professor Roberts said.    To be fair, Stanford and other schools are doing more than flacking to get their rankings up. Stanford recently rammed through several changes in faculty workloads and teaching methodologies that rival deans insist were prompted by the specter of 1990's questionnaires -- but that will work to the benefit of students nonetheless.    Indeed, a growing number of deans think the Business Week survey may yet have a positive effect on business-school education. \\"John gave the little kids, the students, a chance to talk about the emperor's new clothes -- and when it came to the clothes called education, they recognized when the emperor was naked,\\" said Stern's Dean West.    He should know. Dean West says that for five years he has been trying to persuade his own faculty that they emphasize research at the expense of education. They would not listen, he said, until Stern rated 18th in Business Week.   Since then, faculty members have agreed to make teaching a more important criterion for tenure and merit pay increases, and to make training in pedagogical skills mandatory for inexperienced faculty members. They are also forcing seasoned faculty members to teach introductory courses. \\"It was only after Business Week publicly downgraded us that people got amenable to change,\\" Dean West said.    The University of Chicago had a similar reaction. Within weeks after Business Week ranked it an unheard-of 11th,the school appointed a committee to figure out why it was being \\"bashed by its students,\\" said Dean Davis. The committee has since suggested ways to bring the courses more in line with what the students need. \\"The Business Week survey represents information from the market,\\" he said. \\"To say that is garbage is just not true,\\" Dean Davis said.   Business Week may also, indirectly, catalyze changes at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School. Randi S. N. Yoder, the associate dean for external affairs, concedes she was hired primarily to get Carlson onto the Business Week list (no luck yet). To do that she is cultivating reporters -- including Mr. Byrne -- to enhance the school's reputation. And, she has commissioned her own poll of Carlson students, to see whether there are changes the school should be making in teaching methods or student services. \\"The survey made us more sensitive to students' needs,\\" she said.   At other schools, though, the survey's effect is murkier. William L. Witzel, a 61-year-old Maryland alumnus, recently financed a study to see how his alma mater measured up to schools of similar size. He bridles at the suggestion that he is trying to raise its ranking. \\"I would never fund something that cosmetic,\\" he said.   Ask Ms. Coogan about Mr. Witzel's grant, though, and a different story emerges. She says the school is evaluating a plan that Mr. Witzel and several professors have worked out to raise Maryland's ranking. \\"Bill Witzel said to the school, 'I want to give something back, what can I do?' \\" Ms. Coogan recalled. \\"We said, 'Get us on the list.' \\" The M.B.A. Rate Race"},{"year":"1941","title":"Golden Eagle (packet boat) sinks, Mississippi River","excerpt":"112 saved, 1 dead PACKET SINKS, 112 SAVED; Mississippi Skipper Holds Craft 'Agin Bank' -- Boy Killed"},{"year":"1930","title":"Sectional qualifying rounds GREAT GOLF FIELD FOR U.S. OPEN PLAY","excerpt":"112 Selected in Sectional Qualifying to Supplement Exempted Entries.WALKER AND HANCOCK LOSE New York Provided Notable Failures, Among Them Brady,Cruickshank, Sweetser.

The dining room has a bar on one side, a black-and-white tile floor, a high pressed-tin ceiling and blue-speckled Formica tables. The menu changes often. On the current list of offerings are apple pecan fritters with bourbon creamed corn; grilled eggplant and roasted pepper salad; avocado, jack cheese and blackened chicken tortilla, and a tart of grilled onion, sweet Gorgonzola and pear.   Among the entrees, there are Maryland crab cakes with a caper sour cream sauce, mashed potatoes and greens; seared pork chops with an apricot-jalapeno sauce; vegetable curry with coconut, lime and ginger, and a napoleon of tuna in a pool of savory caramel sauce.

The original dining room is the more charming of the two, with a painted tin ceiling, pale yellow walls, a wall montage of vegetables and vines, and fine old wood serving tables. The larger, newer room, which brings the restaurant's capacity to 140, is more austere and produces echoes.   An antipasto buffet offers a selection of tantalizing appetizers. Among the best are the grilled shrimp with white beans and escarole; terrine of eggplant and roasted peppers; grilled shiitake mushrooms and fennel salad, and Tuscan lentil salad with pancetta and garlic.   Pizzas, have thin, dense crusts. The toppings are fresh and brightly seasoned. The Cucina pizza, for example, has artichoke, grilled eggplant, salty soppressata (a smoked sausage of pork and bacon), fennel, tomato and mozzarella.    Superior entrees include osso buco in a Barolo wine sauce, served with pappardelle; roast rack of lamb with rosemary potatoes and fresh mint sauce; grilled salmon with escarole and plum tomatoes, and linguine nostra, combining lobster, shrimp and mussels in a tomato-basil sauce.

John tends a busy kitchen turning out zesty home-style food, while Camille warmly greets neighborhood patrons in the 25-seat dining room.   Portions are generous indeed, even for the bread, which may be a sesame-seed baguette one evening, a crusty peasant loaf the next. Among the appetizers are grilled mozzarella panini with a pesto of roasted red peppers; cod croquettes with an arugula-and-garlic sauce, and shrimp kebabs with lentil salad and a citrus-and-parsley sauce. Other specialties include fillet of beef served with a white peppercorn and port-wine glaze; deviled crab cakes with a green curry sauce, and a seafood stew with feta cheese and fresh tomato.

The restaurant has a well-worn charm: a long oak bar, elbow-worn to a patina, and dining rooms with exposed wooden beams, brass chandeliers and weathered beer-hall tables. No-nonsense waiters appear to have worked there forever, and if you ask for a menu, one might respond: \\"No menu. How do you like your steak?\\"   Actually, there are a few other options, although steak is king here. You can get a well-broiled porterhouse steak, dry-aged and full of flavor (portions serve one to four); thick double lamb chops, and good broiled fish.

The food, while uneven during recent visits, still can match the setting for thrills.   Among the starters are a roast squab, marinated in soy and honey, with fried lotus root and enoki mushrooms and a towering parfait of tuna and salmon tartars with two kinds of caviar.
