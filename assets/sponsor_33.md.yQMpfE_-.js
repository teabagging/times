The savior of the hour, whose name was being flagrantly painted on every fence and blank wall, was an ex-carnival showman whose old-fashioned sucker-baiting methods, no longer successful in fooling a midway crowd, proved more effective in politics, where people will fall for anything.If you think you recognize this country, through which the ingratiating comedians, Voskovec and Werich, wander with dazed expressions, you are mistaken, for it is non-existent. It seems that when this clownish pair made the film called \\"The World Is Ours\\" (now showing at the World Cinema), the Czecho-Slovakian censors ordered that brown shirts be changed to gray hats, Nazis and gangsters, and—what is more important—Czecho-Slovakia, to \\"some non-existent country.\\" It is a sad and ironical circumstance that even if the locale of \\"The World Is Ours\\" had been admittedly Czecho-Slovakia, the effect today, alas, would be the same: a non-existent country.What has taken place in the world since the negative and all but this one print of \\"The World Is Ours\\" were destroyed may somewhat complicate one's emotional response: may make the comedy seem a little sad, the brave propaganda for freedom, ending on a spectacle of free men trampling gray hats into the pavements, depressing like a bright flag waving over an empty citadel.But that the comedy is still richly comical, in the Chaplinesque tradition of a small clown unwillingly implicated in large events, it is impossible to deny. One owes it as a last melancholy duty to the nonexistent country in which it is laid to see \\"The World Is Ours\\" and to reflect how ghostly, in this mechanical world of ours, is the sound of posthumous laughter.
