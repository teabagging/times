For, in \\"The Final Test,\\" the import that took its turn at bat at the Baronet yesterday, they are swinging away at cricket—if such an uncivilized term may be used here—and having themselves some gay innings with Britain's national pastime.Mr. Rattigan's theme undoubtedly is serious—cricket is revered as a way of life, as any public schoolboy will tell you—but somehow the chuckles and even some abdominal laughter with which this antic is loaded make the proceedings a good deal lighter than, say, Ibsen and Chekhov.The story is, to bare it to its essentials, the saga of a famed cricketer — a London-type Babe Ruth—whose illustrious career is ending with his last test match between England and Australia. He is most anxious to have his 'teen-aged son see him play for the last time, but his son is enthused about poetry and England's most noted poet-playwright, who, it turns out, idolizes both cricket and this famous exponent of the ancient game.There is, of course, a minor love story involving our aging athlete and a winsome barmaid, but that is merely an obbligato to the major fireworks. Credit the Messrs. Rattigan and Asquith with knowing that comedy depends as much on \\"sight gags\\" as it does on funny lines. There are enough of both to satisfy the customers.Include among these a visiting American Senator who is benignly inquiring into English mores and habits The play-by-play description of the game given to him by an unperturbed Britain who is aghast at the idea that this test match will generate \\"excitement\\" is a delicious lampoon.Include also such bits as the playwright's definition of cricket as something \\"which refuses to be exciting. It's like going to see Chekhov in seach of melodrama.\\" And, the spectacle of the crowds cheering the cricketer who has obviously ended his career ingloriously gives the film its tone and wry humor.As the playwright, Robert Morley is an amiable despot, a comic caricature in a siren suit, who goes about insulting people with the best intentions. Mr. Morley, who already has proven his ability to do justice to dialogue, does it again, this time with a flair. He refers to his secretary as \\"an expectant vulture\\" and to himself, on his first meeting with a famous batsman, as \\"completely inarticulate, all I could make was clicking noises.\\"The remainder of the small cast makes the proceedings just as delightful in less flamboyant fashion. Jack Warner is properly restrained and professional as the great cricketer who wants the best for his son","excerpt":"Brenda Bruce is fine as the Cockney barmaid with whom he is decorously in love and Adrianne Allen, as his sister; Ray Jackson, as his artistically inclined son, and Stanley Maxted, as the Senator help make this adventure a frolic.Perhaps the cognoscenti will not call \\"The Final Test\\" cricket, but it definitely adds up to fun.

It was a joy to see the veteran pianist and conductor each so thoroughly in his element, even if they were not always perfectly in tune -- or rather, in time -- with each other.         Mr. Brendel's impetuous manner, with notes dropped along the way -- sometimes by the handful -- proved more thoroughly satisfying in the ebullient Second Concerto, which was actually Beethoven's first, than in the ineffably lyrical Fourth. Especially in the Fourth's finale, the pianist might have given greater  emphasis to those blossoming low G's and D's, with which Claudio Arrau used to plumb such astounding depths. Still, it is hard to think of another pianist today who could give a more persuasive account of either work, let alone both.    MUSIC REVIEW","excerpt":"Brendel and Beethoven, Contd."},{"year":"1994","title":"There was a world of difference between Alfred Brendel's performances of four Beethoven sonatas on Monday evening at Carnegie Hall and his readings of the same works in his classic recordings of the 1970's. Back then, he seemed to be teaching the sonatas, presenting them as gems of crystalized musical imagination, set in velvet and examined in a bright, analytical light. Those accounts were by no means passionless, but their principal appeal was intellectual. Now the excitement Mr. Brendel finds in these works is more visceral, more concerned with the gritty, real-life side of Beethoven's music. The velvet has not entirely been cast aside, but the emphasis has shifted from admiring the music to experiencing it.    The works at hand in this installment of Mr. Brendel's three-year Beethoven cycle were the composer's first three sonatas (Op. 2) and his 23d, the \\"Appassionata\\" (Op. 57). The juxtaposition of the early works, completed in 1795, and the mature \\"Appassionata,\\" composed a decade later, tells an interesting story of shattered conventions and conceptual expansion. What Mr. Brendel showed, however, was that the seeds of explosive emotionalism that drive the \\"Appassionata\\" are to be found in the Opus 2 Sonatas, disguised by a veneer of Haydnesque decorousness.

As the vast collection went on sale, however, artists and intellectuals were ready to protest the dispersal of the principal record of the interwar Surrealist movement. Gathered outside the H&#244;tel Drouot, the main Paris auction house, they distributed pamphlets, chanted slogans and blocked bidders trying to enter the building. Finally, calm was restored as the first of 22 auction sessions through April 18 went ahead with the sale of books from Breton's collection, many of them dedicated to him. Among the 4,100 lots in the auction are 3,500 books, 800 manuscripts, 500 photographs, 400 paintings and drawings and 150 American Indian and Oceanic art objects. The estimated value of the sale is $30 million to $40 million. In France the preferred scapegoat is always the government. Successive governments showed no interest in creating a foundation or museum for the works preserved in Breton's tiny apartment at 42, rue Fontaine in the Pigalle district. In reality, the best of the collection may still stay in France. Over the last three decades, the Breton estate sold a number of paintings to government-owned museums. After the death of Breton's widow, Elisa, ''Breton's Wall'' -- the 250 works of art on the wall behind his desk -- was given to the Georges Pompidou Center in lieu of estate taxes. During the current auction, the government is also expected to exercise its right to buy prized objects at the price they have been sold to a bidder.
