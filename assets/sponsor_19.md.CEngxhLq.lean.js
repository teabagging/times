RECENT PROJECTS: The Cub Room, Kelley & Ping and T, all in SoHo","excerpt":"Spartina in TriBeCa, Rubicon in San Francisco and the Bee Brook Cafe in Washington, Conn. EARLIER PROJECTS: Union Square Cafe and Follonico in the Flatiron district, and Savoy and Kin Khao in SoHo. Q. What's your restaurant design philosophy? A. I still do a decent amount of residential jobs, and I like to keep the domestic scene going because I can see how people like to live and entertain. I take those scenes and extend them in the restaurants, which are hot right now. It's the main way to entertain. Q.  What do you personally want in a restaurant? A. To feel relaxed. Some people want to be titillated, excited. A space should offer some of that. In the 80's, it was the disco restaurants, all that shiny material. Then they closed down.  Q. How do you stay in touch with tastes but at the same time design a setting that will last? A. I try to create a timeless environment, to instill a sense that the restaurant's always been there. Q. What are the fads? A. Homeyness -- a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere. I try to use natural materials, domestic woods like cherry, linoleum versus vinyl. I use a lot of stuff from Environmental Construction Outfitters in SoHo. At the T room, there's no rain-forest wood, no dangerous chemicals, no toxic materials. But it's not a religion for me. Q. What's all this comfort about? A. It's so important now. Modern life is uncomfortable, hurried, noisy. The domestic environment should be comfortable so you can relax, lean back, think. Q. But isn't a restaurant supposed to be a little different from home? A. Yes, people need to be entertained, so you need to make a restaurant a little more flamboyant, use brighter colors on walls, elaborate fabrics and light fixtures, make it more dressed-up. Q. What's artificial? A. Big, loud places in the Flatiron district. I'm doing one there now, and I'm scared. What can I say? I'll try to make it very relaxed. The buzzword in restaurant design is democratic, \\"of the people.\\" I try to be careful with that word. It's something for everyman, universal. Q. How is the new Cub Room democratic? A. It's current to the 90's, and it's not meant to be a supper club. It has a casual cafe with a takeout section, and you can sit down. The barroom is where you can also eat, but it's for the young and beautiful. There's a nook where you can see pastry chefs working -- this is a little anti-reactionary. The dining room is separate, quieter, more comfortable, a tiny bit more formal with a more adult crowd. Off that room is a chef's dining room, the scale of a private dining room at home, with a table for 12. All the rooms are meant to peek into the kitchen without the noise. Q. What are other trends in restaurants? A. Retail, a lot of diversity in one place. The idea is not to exclude anyone, not the rich, the old, etc. I'm doing a place in Burlington, Vt., which has a housewares area, a restaurant, a cafe and a bakery. Bigger spaces are also a trend, and in that some people need their own little corner, a cocoon, while others like to be in the middle of the room. Q. What else is your style? A. I tailor styles to the client, taking the same approach as I do in my residential work. Most of the restaurant owners I work with are individuals, not companies or corporations. Kelley & Ping, for example, reflects my style in the painted wood floor, the easygoing tone. My work also has a sense of rough and soft, like masonry with upholstery. Examples of that are the T room, Savoy, Union Square Cafe. Q. Do you do research for your restaurants? A. I travel and go out to dinner all the time. I also take clients around to restaurants I like and dislike. Or we tour them, picking out lighting, floors. I take notes, pictures. Most restaurants don't mind if you do this. Q. What are some restaurants you're working on now? A. Heights Cafe in Brooklyn Heights. The Lemon in the Flatiron district. Lucky Dog Diner on the Lower East Side. A cafe in Battery Park. Warren Ashworth, my associate, is also working on these. Q. Do you ever think of opening your own restaurant? A. All the time. It would be a peaceful place, but that's all I want to say.

Great powers are not made every day. The list that most would agree on today  -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and China -- would have been nearly the same 100 years ago. (Austria-Hungary is the dropout exception.) China is the new giant on the block. Depending on how you count, China has either the ninth- or the second-largest economy in the world and is growing by about 10 percent annually. Its military budget is the world's fourth-largest and is growing robustly as well. It is home to one of the dominant civilizations of the world, with a diaspora spreading across East Asia  and beyond.

On college campuses, where there should be the freedom to explore and create the best possible type of society, women are not reaching their potential because sexism remains ingrained in society.    As Ms. Kamen notes, some women are afraid to label themselves feminists, though they believe women and men should receive equal pay for equal work and admit that sexism still exists. I agree that women from the mainstream must join those who have been termed \\"radicals\\" to insure that the gains that have been made are not lost.   Women who attend women's colleges have a special obligation. We know the value of having women's voices heard in class and in leadership roles on campus. But even on campuses of women's colleges, feminism is still a dirty word to many, or at least a label from which many shy.   In our daily campus newspaper, we have one female columnist, but it is not because we have a quota, or a quota of one, as Ms. Quindlen points out may exist in other newspapers. Unfortunately, most of the columns we receive are written by men, as if many women on campus have passively accepted their traditional role of not being heard. Many men and women on our \\"progressive\\" campus read our female columnist with snickers and smirks because she writes about women's issues.    Young women of every perspective need to voice their opinions on all issues -- politics, religion, education, business, sports, science -- not just the women's issues on which we are told we have some authority and right to speak.

Foley; George J. Mitchell, Senate majority leader, and Robert H. Michel, the Republican leader in the House:    The current situation in the Persian Gulf, brought about by Iraq's unprovoked invasion and subsequent brutal occupation of Kuwait, threatens vital U.S. interests. The situation also threatens the peace. It would, however, greatly enhance the chances for peace if Congress were now to go on record supporting the position adopted by the U.N. Security Council on 12 separate occasions. Such an action would underline that the United States stands with the international community and on the side of law and decency; it also would help dispel any belief that may exist in the minds of Iraq's leaders that the United States lacks the necessary unity to act decisively in response to Iraq's continued aggression against Kuwait.   Secretary of State Baker is meeting with Iraq's Foreign Minister on Jan. 9. It would have been most constructive if he could have presented the Iraqi Government a Resolution passed by both houses of Congress supporting the U.N. position and in particular Security Council Resolution 678. As you know, I have frequently stated my desire for such a Resolution. Nevertheless, there is still opportunity for Congress to act to strengthen the prospects for peace and safeguard this country's vital interests.   I therefore request that the House of Representatives and the Senate adopt a Resolution stating that Congress supports the use of all necessary means to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 678. Such action would send the clearest possible message to Saddam Hussein that he must withdraw without condition or delay from Kuwait. Anything less would only encourage Iraqi intransigence; anything else would risk detracting from the international coalition arrayed against Iraq's aggression.   I am determined to do whatever is necessary to protect America's security. I ask Congress to join with me in this task. I can think of no better way than for Congress to express its support for the President at this critical time. This truly is the last best chance for peace.
