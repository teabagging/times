At the end of the sold-out concert, on Saturday night at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., flocks of women were finding their way up to kiss the group's charismatic lead singer, Jon Bon Jovi, dance with him a bit, and be photographed not just in his presence, but also all over and around his presence. It was rock celebrity pandemonium, and everybody, fans and band alike, were having a great time.   One of the great myths fueling rock suggests that lower-middle-class people, usually male and white, can both make oodles of money and maintain the rebellious stance so important to rock's adolescent audience. There's a clear contradiction in the myth, and Bon Jovi, as well as any band alive, has learned to play both sides of the problem. In 1986, when the band's record \\"Slippery When Wet\\" (Polygram) began its ascent, eventually selling some 13 million copies, Bon Jovi was the ideal prole band, a group of guys from New Jersey who hit it big. In their clothes, action and lyrics, the band pointed to a blue-collar tradition not so much linked to the urban decay mined by self-conscious prole poets like Bruce Springsteen, but to a suburban reality found in mall glamour and wasted Saturday nights. Mr. Bon Jovi, with his long blond hair, became a rock celebrity who was a hunk, enormously wealthy and who could sing songs like \\"Wild in the Streets.\\" Critics, preferring to celebrate older, more romantic types of working-class rebellion, hated -- and still hate -- the band.

Even during the prosperity of the 1980's, the city lost about 150,000 factory jobs.    But to the surprise of some labor economists, blue-collar workers are not disappearing. In fact, despite the lost factory jobs, the overall number of blue-collar workers increased by 140,000 from 1983 to 1989, bringing the total to 740,000 last year. Blue-collar jobs of all types now account for about a fifth of the city's work force.    Still, in a city that has become increasingly dominated by what Mr. Ehrenhalt of the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls knowledge-based industries, many of these blue-collar jobs require more training and more skills than the usual entry-level, industrial jobs. Workers who once might have worked on carburetors are now expected to care for computers and other sophisticated electronic gear.   This problem is a worrisome one in New York City, where already perhaps half a million working-age people are not looking for work, because they are held back by lack of education or skills. Indeed, only 25 percent of the city's young people have jobs or are looking for them, about half the rate of their counterparts in Houston or Los Angeles.    Construction work has been a quick route to the middle class, especially for many people just starting their work lives. But that industry, which had surged in the 1980's real estate boom, is now experiencing a sharp decline that has idled as many as 25 percent of the workers in some trades.    \\"The more demanding jobs structure and an education system with a 38 percent dropout rate are on a collision course,\\" Mr. Ehrenhalt warned.
