Within just a few days, I discovered that business school would be a far more turbulent and, as they say in California, awesome experience than I had expected. And so I offer these notes, a record of my first year, as a simple act of decency. Like going back to the last calm bend in the river and nailing up a sign saying, \\"Waterfall Ahead.\\"\\n* Two Americas. My favorite item in the school library was a wall map called \\"The Two Americas.\\" I expected the familiar theme that America was divided between rich and poor. Instead, the map was about purchasing patterns for mayonnaise. Apparently, the nation's North and West buy Miracle Whip, while the South and East go with Hellmann's.\\n\\nIn business school, you learn to think much differently.\\n* Gunnar's Plans. One evening, I had dinner with Gunnar Haakonsen. Gunnar was 6 feet 1, lean, muscled, handsome, blond. After majoring in economics at Amherst, he spent three years as an analyst at Bear, Stearns. Over beers and tostadas, he asked why I had come to business school. \\"Because it's a year shorter than law school,\\" I answered, only half jokingly.\\n\\nWhy had he come? He leaned across the table and fixed me with a steely gaze. \\"To position myself for a quantum career leap in financial services,\\" he said.\\n\\nI knew how villagers must have felt when Viking ships appeared.\\n* Tom Wolfe, Reconsidered. The interviewers from Dillon, Read kept asking if I was sure I wanted to go into investment banking after working in the White House. I was baffled. After all, in\\"The Bonfire of the Vanities,\\" Tom Wolfe calls investment bankers \\"masters of the universe.\\" How could they possibly wonder why I wanted to become one of them?\\n\\nI suspect that what took place in that hotel room was a collision of illusions. The Dillon, Read men considered the White House the seat of all earthly glory. I knew better","excerpt":"working at the White House involved a lot of long hours and merely routine toil.\\n\\nAnd I? I believed investment bankers existed on a higher plane of being. But maybe they knew better. Maybe their jobs involved . . . a lot of long hours and merely routine toil.\\n* Romance, Adventure. The usual economic models say entrepreneurs start their ventures just to make money. Professor David Font disagreed.\\n\\n\\"According to Schumpeter,\\" Mr. Font said, \\"the puny motive of profit maximization barely explains anything about entrepreneurs at all. Just listen to this.\\" He picked up a dog-eared book, adjusted his glasses and read aloud.\\n\\n\\"There is the will to conquer, the impulse to fight, to prove oneself superior to others, to succeed for the sake, not of the fruits of success, but of success itself. Finally there is the joy of creating, of getting things done, or simply exercising one's energy and ingenuity.\\"\\n\\nMr. Font set the book down. \\"Capitalism,\\" he said, \\"is not a matter of counting coins. Capitalism is a romance and an adventure.\\"\\n\\nMr. Font's understanding of business rose above technical disciplines to acknowledge the soul. But his classroom was often a third empty.\\n* Worthy Questions. For all its trials, Stanford heightened my appreciation of the brains and talent and sheer creativity required in business. \\n\\nDriving in from the airport on Christmas break, I noticed for the first time that a number of high-tech firms had offices in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs of Washington. When I read the paper the next morning, I only skimmed the politics before reading the business section in detail. Then, at a department store one afternoon, I got impatient at the checkout counter. Shoppers all around were backing up and growing angry.\\n\\n\\"Where's the manager?\\" I wondered, irritably. \\"Doesn't he know he's incurring ill will? Can't he see that hiring more checkout people for the holidays would net him at least $200 an hour?\\"\\n\\nBusiness school analyzes such problems. How does a company account for its costs? How does a factory decide how many cars to produce each week? How does an entrepreneur get backing?\\n\\nAre these the worthiest questions one can ponder? Clearly not. We're not talking about sin and redemption here. Yet business school can tell you a lot about your workplace, your grocery store or your bank, helping you to understand the economic activities that take up the larger part of your life. This is no small claim.

Johnny Depp had already been cast as J.M. Barrie, the author of ''Peter Pan,'' and the studio, Miramax, was hoping for a more marketable name to star opposite him, like Gwyneth Paltrow, perhaps, or Nicole Kidman. The film, directed by Marc Forster, weaves together a tragic family story and the creation of Barrie's greatest artistic triumph. Out in theaters in October, ''Neverland'' is eloquently sentimental, a movie that beautifully depicts the link between art and life, where influences overlap and inspire.    ''I loved the script,'' Winslet recalled, ''but I'm not sure Johnny even knew my work.'' She laughed at the memory. Winslet was calling from her car, which was parked outside her house in London. ''This is the only place I can get any privacy,'' she explained. Just outside the car, her husband, the director Sam Mendes (''American Beauty''), entertained their 6-month-old son, Joe, while Winslet's 3-year-old daughter, Mia, played inside the house. Winslet resists the usual battalion of nannies and housekeepers and managers and assistants (''I couldn't cope with lots of people''), and she projects a mood of happy chaos -- things always seem to be in a half jumble. But even with the hubbub, there's a stunning directness, a kind of passionate belief in life's possibilities, that sets Winslet apart. She has not only consistently voiced her values, as so many other actors know how to do, but she has also lived them: sacrificing a cushy box-office career for art-house films","excerpt":"working in England to support the British film industry; giving up plum parts to be with her family; not becoming twig thin, even for nude scenes, although members of the press have attacked her weight; and fighting for parts that were offered to actresses who have more closely looked after their bankability.

And three of the four new and recent dances she presented on Saturday night at the Merce Cunningham Studio were blessed with that same open spirit.   This was Ms. Sherman's first full evening of her own choreography. She opened it with a charming, boisterous portrait of herself called \\"Me 'n' My Spider,\\" set to a music collage arranged by Markley Boyer. Created with Ruth Ayres, who played a variety of second-banana roles, the new duet took Ms. Sherman from a giddily imaginative childhood through reckless adolescence and into the august world of dance. Ms. Sherman's moments-long take on Ailey and Graham Dance was smart, funny and loving. Then it was back to the child, now happy company in adulthood.

It has been in the process of restoration as a museum for the past decade, and it is used periodically for fund-raising exhibitions, special events, and outdoor fetes in summer.    Opening Friday, and running through April 15, an exhibit called \\"Legrand Lockwood and the Taste for American Art,\\" is focusing on 20 of Lockwood's favorite artists. Several of the paintings and sculptures were part of his private collection, auctioned off by his widow after he died in 1872, having lost most of his fortune in the 1869 crash.    The works are on loan from museums and individuals. Some were not owned by Lockwood but were created by artists whom he favored. Among them are Frederic Church, Albert Bierstadt, William Bradford, and Asher B. Durand.    Lockwood amassed a collection of more than 100 pieces, typical of many wealthy Americans during the post-Civil War period who began buying the work of American artists, rather than following the fashionable trend of purchasing only European artists. The patronage of their own countrymen gave American painters and sculptors an opportunity to develop their talents at home rather than emigrating to Europe in order to earn a living.    Museum hours are Tuesday through Friday from 11 A.M. to 3 P.M., and Sunday from 1 to 4. Admission is $5, students and the elderly $3, children free. Call 838-2434 for more information. SHARED HOUSING     Maggie Kuhn, founder of the Gray Panthers, will speak at a symposium on cooperative intergenerational housing on Saturday from 9 A.M. to noon in the Davies Auditorium at Yale in New Haven. The title of her talk is \\"Shared Dwellings, Shared Lives.\\"    The program was organized by Sage Services of Connecticut, an agency supported by the State Department on Aging to establish a home sharing network. \\"We try to match up people who want to share living arrangements in the 20 towns of greater New Haven,\\" said Virgina Einhorn, the program coordinator. One person in the home must be over 60.    A panel of Yale faculty members will address particular aspects of the program in three workshops. Dr. Paula Milone-Nuzzo, from the School of Nursing, will talk about the economics of aging. Elizabeth Swenson, from the School of Architecture, will discuss design requirements in housing for the elderly, and the Rev. Gaylord Noyce of the Divinity School will talk about the relationships in shared housing.    For more information on the free program, call 777-7401. 'REALLY ROSIE'     The poems and drawings of Maurice Sendak's \\"Really Rosie,\\" set to music by Carole King, will be performed by the Hartford Children's Theater on Thursday through Saturday at 8 P.M., and Saturday and Sunday at 2 P.M. in the Roberts Theater, Kingswood Road, West Hartford.

WALLPAPER IN HISTORY     Catherine Lynn, director of education and development at the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, is a former curator of the wallpaper collection at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in Manhattan and the author of \\"Wallpaper in America: The 17th Century to World War I,\\" published in 1980 by W. W. Norton.     She will give a talk, \\"Wallpaper in the 18th and 19th Centuries: A Connecticut Perspective,\\" today at 3 P.M. in the Connecticut Historical Society auditorium, 1 Elizabeth Street, Hartford. Included in her survey of fashionable homes is the Hatheway House in Suffield, built in 1761, and containing superb late 18th-century French neoclassic wallpapers. The building is one of several maintained by the Antiquarian and Landmarks Society, sponsors of today's program.    Her talk will also cover the substantial number of ordinary people who could not afford French imports but decorated their homes with simple single-color domestic papers. Admission to the talk is free. Call 247-8996 for more information. 'UNCLE TOM'S CABIN'     Ronald Powell and Anthony Watts have drawn elements from a drama by George Aiken and from Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" and reworked them into a play called \\"Uncle Tom: Dead or Alive.\\" It will be presented by the Crescent Players of Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven, Friday through Sunday, and March 6 through 9, at the Lyman Center for the Performing Arts at the university. Sunday performances are at 3 P.M., all the rest are at 8 P.M. in the Jorgensen Auditorium at UConn in Storrs.    The 19th-century melodrama in two acts and several scenes is introduced by commentators in modern dress who interject issues of historic and contemporary racism from the viewpoints of blacks and whites.    Written into the script are the characters of Uncle Tom, Eliza and Topsy, along with Harriet Beecher Stowe, Frederick Douglass and other people who were important to the civil rights movement. Tickets are $6, with discounts available for students and the elderly. The box office number is 397-4435.

When he is depicting a cigarette, which might also be interpreted as a factory smokestack, the use of actual tar is another way of commenting on the subject and giving it life.

On view is a remarkable exhibition of more than two dozen paintings and drawings and five sculptures by Max Beckmann, perhaps the most important German artist of the century. The show has an illuminating intimacy that penetrates the stiff, distancing layers that history and reputation so often give an artist, providing a glimpse of the inner workings of his mind and eye.   Beckmann died in 1950 in New York City at the age of 65, three years after he immigrated to the United States from Amsterdam, where he sat out World War II, and 13 years after he left Nazi Germany. Until 1933 he had been one of his country's most respected artists, with a room devoted to his work at the National Gallery in Berlin, but Hitler's rise to power and campaign against modern art changed that. Almost immediately, Beckmann, though not Jewish, was dismissed from the Stadel Art School in Frankfurt, where he had taught since 1925. Soon his paintings were yanked out of German museums, along with those by other members of the European avant-garde, to be placed in the Nazi's \\"degenerate art\\" exhibition of 1937.

But although there were stylistic gulfs between these works, there was a curious undercurrent common to them all. Each work seemed to be propelled by a set of inner conflicts, by competing impulses pulling against each other.    In the case of Donald Martino's Set for Clarinet (1954), those impulses were the desire to draw on popular forms -- jazz and blues -- but to do so within a language of rigorous atonality, and to shine a spotlight on a clarinetist's virtuosity without losing sight of the work's compositional ingenuity. The thematic and harmonic simplicity of John Cage's Six Melodies for Violin and Piano (1950) disguises subtle complexities and elaboration. Elizabeth Brown's \\"Memory Palace\\" (1990), for flute, cello and piano, uses a tonally freewheeling language (neither strictly rooted nor fully atonal) and an abstract structure to paint a distinct, if fanciful, picture in which thematic relationships come increasingly into focus as the piece unfolds.

The larger-than-life canvases that seem to engulf and all but overwhelm the viewer offer a singular kind of experience - the sheer dominance of their physical presence forces them on our consciousness before we can evaluate the significance of their impact. Those who have studied the murals of the Renaissance and the epic salon paintings and landscape panoramas of the 19th century, and that includes all the pioneer postwar abstractionists of the New York School, well understand this transportation of the senses and the spirit via giant scale.   But that doesn't mean art has to be big to be good. One has only to think of Kurt Schwitters's tiny Dadaist assemblages, those unsavory mementos of esthetic anarchy, to realize that creative energy is no less vital for having imploded upon itself.

It came to hear a concert of Haydn, Barber, Brahms and Menotti.   The promise of the deed and the deed itself are not always the same, and they were not on Thursday. But Mr. Anagnost had some interesting possibilities to dangle in front of his listeners. One was Haydn's overture to \\"Il Ritorno di Tobia,\\" music more talked about by historians than heard today.

Recent attempts to revive a moribund musical world have included several brainy jolts administered with mixed success by the American Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Leon Botstein. But the program Mr. Botstein presented on Friday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, a fascinating juxtaposition of works by Alfred Schnittke and Sofia Gubaidulina, drew impetus from a less likely source, the long-maligned New York Philharmonic.   Virgil Thomson dismissed the Philharmonic as irrelevant to the city's intellectual life in 1940, and listeners in the 80's had reason to wonder whether the orchestra was even a factor in the city's musical life. But Kurt Masur has given a more thoughtful cast to programming and audience-building, and the Philharmonic's recent Composer Week, devoted to Mr. Schnittke, set a broader agenda in and around the city, spawning an informal festival. The American Symphony program was merely the latest in a remarkable outpouring of performances and discussions of Mr. Schnittke's music and that of other former Soviet composers.

During this crucial moment of his career, he was painting both with the current and against it, charting a course that would make him one of postwar American art's more influential outsiders.    There is more than a touch of contrariness in Stout's career and, before the black-and-white paintings that became, in effect, a series of journeys without end, a good deal of movement. Stout was born in Denton, Tex., in 1908, and taught art in Honolulu both during and after the war. In 1949, he -- like his teacher and friend Hans Hofmann -- began dividing his time between New York City and Provincetown, Mass. In 1954, just as New York was establishing itself as    the    artistic center, Stout settled in Provincetown, where he lived until his death in 1987. In his small studio by the water, with the companionship of sun and sand, he painted in black and white.

As it happens, Professor Schickele's current series of Carnegie concerts, which began on Wednesday evening, also marks an anniversary for him, his 25th as an advocate for the unbegotten Bach. If the musical world remains steadfastly unconvinced that so dismal a composer could ever have existed, it is not for any lack of tireless and brilliant effort on the professor's part.

How will the troupe make everyone laugh?

No refreshments are available except for a water fountain. 'Babes in Toyland' Light Opera of Manhattan Symphony Space 2537 Broadway (at 95th Street) (212) 864-5400 Recommended ages: 3 and up Through Monday   This company's rather lighthearted approach toward the gentle Toymaker, his devoted toys, the scheming detective Peter Pinkerton and the Cassidys, a family in crisis, is treated with a slightly ironic hand, thereby reducing the potential gushiness. The musical is indeed a show for parents and children, if only for its moving melodies, lovingly performed, and its range of costumes and characters, the latter including the charming and the not-so-charming (yes, you, Mr. Cassidy). Raymond Allen is particularly suited to his role as the Toymaker: he makes Captain Kangaroo seem churlish. A 15-minute intermission allows enough time for the children to have their pictures taken with Billy Bear, at $5 a shot. They can also visit the toy shop, which is stuffed with bears, and the water fountain. Though Symphony Space has no place to check strollers, it is a comfortable, roomy place to take children. Tickets are and $13.50 and $17.50 for adults, $10 for children. Performance times are tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 P.M., Sunday at 3 P.M. and Monday at 7 P.M. 3-D 'Kiss Me Kate' Film Forum 209 West Houston Street Manhattan (212) 727-8110 Recommended ages: 9 and up Through Thursday  This may not be the first film you'll think of when taking the family to the movies this weekend to relax. But its 3-D format may be something your children have yet to experience. The theater provides the glasses, which will make you feel as if you're sitting in the same room as the actors on the screen. In fact, the characters in the film seem to have an unnerving tendency to throw objects (scarfs, plates, you name it) into the audience, or so it seems. If you don't wear the glasses, the screen looks blurred. The story is about a romance, of sorts, between two actors, Lilli Vanessi (Kathryn Grayson) and Fred Graham (Howard Keel), who, while starring in a live musical production of \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" fight their personal battles on and off the stage. Although the plot borders on the corny and disagreements are resolved instantly with song-and-dance routines, the Cole Porter score and the energetic choreography take the movie into the realm of classics. Besides, the dirtiest word you'll hear is \\"louse.\\" Admission, $7; $4.50 for Film Forum members. The 109-minute movie is broken up with a 10-minute intermission, so you can buy a huge $2.50 bag of popcorn or something sweet from L'Ecluse Foods at the theater's highbrow refreshment counter. Call for daily schedule. 'Lightmobile' Sculpture Shearson Lehman Plaza Shearson Lehman Brothers 388 Greenwich Street (near Hubert Street) Manhattan Through Thursday  In the marble-lined lobby of this financial institution in Manhattan sits a 1966 metallic-blue Volkswagen Beetle with a spit-and-polish shine not many people have time to create nowadays. This may be the time to introduce your children to the olden days, when you might very well have driven just this type of car, before the words station wagon and car seat ventured into your vocabulary. This sculpture, by the artist Eric Staller, who lives in lower Manhattan, is not a sight for sensitive eyes: with 1,659 light bulbs flashing sequentially, you may wonder why all obsolete automobiles, lighted up or not, shouldn't end up in office lobbies so that people can appreciate these cars' virtues long after they've been driven off the road. Children's Films Metropolitan Museum of Art Uris Center Auditorium Fifth Avenue and 82d Street Manhattan (212) 879-5500 Recommended ages: 4 to 10 Tomorrow   As part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Holiday Festival of Films for Children, four engaging short films will be shown beginning at 11 A.M. Three of the films, \\"The Three Robbers,\\" \\"The Tender Tale of Cinderella Penguin\\" and \\"Frog and Toad Are Friends,\\" are animated; the last also has puppets. The fourth film, \\"Harry and the Lady Next Door,\\" features live actors and a black-and-white dog.   \\"The Three Robbers,\\" the shortest at six minutes, is adapted from the book by Tomi Ungerer and tells the story of three robbers who brandish unconventional weapons and at first appear to be ruthlessly audacious. But then they meet an orphan, and they have no choice but to emulate Robin Hood. The second film, from the National Film Board of Canada, depicts the Cinderella-story characters as penguins. Cinderella and her stepsisters live in a fancy Tudor-style house with a pumpkin patch in back, which comes in handy when Cinderella needs a coach to get to the ball. Her high-heeled flippers, perfect for a tango with the prince, end up on the right penguin by the movie's end.   \\"Frog and Toad Are Friends\\" is also based on the book of the same name, which chronicles a pair of unlikely companions: Frog, who is a buoyant and blissful fellow, and Toad, the type of guy who needlessly wears a bathing suit when swimming and never receives any letters. The last film, the longest at 20 minutes, details the misadventures of Harry, a frustrated dog, and his next-door neighbor. The problem is that Harry, an otherwise friendly pooch, can't bear to hear any high-pitched noises, including his neighbor's trilling voice. What's a dog to do?   Tickets to the hourlong show are free with proof of admission to the museum, but you must arrive an hour in advance at the Uris Center information desk. Suggested admission is $6 for adults and $3 for students. Keep in Mind  PROSPECT PARK CAROUSEL.

It's the ubiquitous, ever-adapting instrument, with a place in virtually every genre of music and countless variations of shape and sound: acoustic and electric, played with fingertips and picks and slides, 6-string and 12-string and customized, strung with nylon and steel. The three-week NEW YORK GUITAR FESTIVAL, which starts Saturday, takes place in clubs and concert halls, mixing tribute concerts with 21st-century tunes. It embraces everything from blues to classical guitar to avant-rock to bluegrass to jazz to Brazilian and South African music (a full schedule is at www.newyorkguitarfestival.com).    Opening night is a free concert at the Winter Garden in the World Financial Center and it's one of the tributes. ''The Nebraska Project'' revisits Bruce Springsteen's darkest, most stripped-down album: ''Nebraska,'' 10 bleak songs he recorded on a four-track cassette, could not improve with full-band arrangements, and was released as he first recorded it in 1982. It's an album of stories about characters with no way out -- murderers, working stiffs, prodigal sons -- set to a few guitar chords like old country songs or mountain ballads.    Performing the songs will be more than a dozen musicians, in a lineup that mixes visitors like MICHELLE SHOCKED and MARK EITZEL (from American Music Club) with New York City stalwarts like LENNY KAYE from Patti Smith's band, the rhythm-and-blues songwriter MESHELL NDEGEOCELLO, the fringe-of-jazz guitarist MARC RIBOT, the country songwriter LAURA CANTRELL, the speed-fingered guitarist VERNON REID, the folk-rock songwriter MARTHA WAINWRIGHT, the sly and brooding MARC ANTHONY THOMPSON (alias Chocolate Genius Inc.) and the genre-hopping guitarist GARY LUCAS. They're likely to carry some ''Nebraska'' songs back toward roots and others out toward distant horizons.

All of the works were written for the Kronos players -- David Harrington and John Sherba, violinists, Hank Dutt, violist, and Joan Jeanrenaud, cellist.   Hamza el-Din, for example, a Sudanese virtuoso on the oud (an African lute) was commissioned by Lincoln Center to compose \\"Escalay\\" (1989).

fertility rates are starkest in East European countries, but trend hit Western Europe earlier, and has had more time to produce hand-wringing and soul-searching; among reasons for trend are that people are studying longer and marrying later, that contraception and abortion are readily available, that divorce is more common and that would-be parents' attachments to leisure time, conveniences and indulgences do not easily accommodate multiple children--or sometimes, any children at all;
