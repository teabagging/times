Its fourth evaluation flight, which mission controllers called the ''cleanest'' of the program, had demonstrated the military and commercial hybrid that now characterizes America's presence in space.    Shortly after leaving on time from Cape Canaveral last Sunday, the shuttle experienced the kind of malfunction that raises questions about the system's economic viability, if not its technical perfection. Two booster rockets valued at $25 million each, which were designed for refurbishment as a cost-saving measure, plunged to the bottom of the ocean after their parachutes failed. When added to the approximately $12 million price of the external fuel tank sloughed off at the end of the orbiter's ascent, this meant that the ''reusable'' shuttle expended at least $62 million worth of hardware during launch. NASA officials did not expect the booster accident to delay future missions, but the agency is under heavy pressure to make the shuttle economical.

Musicals have claimed Rasta Thomas, who is touring with ''Movin' Out,'' and Dionne Figgins, who is involved in a pre-Broadway workshop.

Not everyone has found a dance slot. ''Six or seven amazingly talented'' women are working in retail, Mr. Naidu said. ''There are only so many places for African-American women who are classical dancers.'' A few of the men are working in restaurants or resorts, he added. Kellye A. Saunders and Kevin Thomas are resting injuries. Others are marrying (Jarina Carvalho), having a baby (Lenore Pavlakos) or going to school (James Anthony Washington). ''We are optimistic that the company will start up again, and everybody is just waiting for the call,'' Mr. Naidu said, adding, ''I feel sorry for all those little companies when Dance Theater of Harlem comes back.''

The immediate cause was pneumonia, and his wife was with him at his death. $(Page A1.$)    With the death of her husband, Leona Helmsley may quickly lose control of Helmsley-Spear Inc., the real estate management firm that reaps an estimated $60 million a year. $(B1.$)    Legal Limits on Diplomats  The United States Government has registered a protest with the Government of Georgia, the former Soviet republic, after one of its diplomats was involved in a car crash in Washington that killed a teen-ager. The accident came shortly after two diplomats from Russia and Belarus were accused by New York City police officers of physically resisting officers attempting to ticket their car for a parking violation. Both cases underscore the legal difficulties of the international rules governing diplomatic immunity, which says the United States can expel diplomats, but not jail, try or sue them. $(A1.$)    Case Leads to Gun Traffickers  An investigation into four handguns found at the scene of the March slaying of a New York City police officer in the Bronx has sent Federal agents streaming to Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia and Virginia, hot on the trails of gun traffickers.
