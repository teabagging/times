LOUIS AUCHINCLOSS'S ''Diary of a Yuppie'' is the story of Robert Service's quick rise to the top in the world of New York law. Service's father was a permanent associate - that is, as a young attorney he was passed over for promotion to partner but remained with his firm in a lesser role. Service is ashamed of his father's failure and intends to succeed. As the novel opens, he is a specialist in corporate takeovers and about to be made a partner at Hoyt, Welles & Andrew, a law firm with 36 partners and a hundred clerks. But Service worries that it is too pedestrian, aristocratic and moralistic to be competitive in the long term. Sensing that decay has set in, he establishes a rival firm, stealing both business and the best associates away from Hoyt, Welles. As he expands his new firm, he deals harshly with rivals and obsequiously with clients. His ethics disturb his wife, who leaves him. After an infatuation with Sylvia Sands, a beautiful, viperish widow, Service manages to win back his wife, all the while keeping his mind on business and opportunistically picking up clients when he can. ''Diary of a Yuppie'' is more than an ordinary story of ambition because of the moralists Service confronts along his way. There is Branders Blakelock, the aging sage at Hoyt, Welles, ''toting a bag of puritan principles,'' who refuses to sacrifice individuals for the benefit of business gain","excerpt":"Alice Service, Robert's wife, who chides him for ''looking down on poor scrapping mortals'' and forgetting the poet in his soul; and Cy Hawkins, a prep school teacher with an interest in theology who expounds on the ideas that suffering can be an honor and martyrdom a connection with God.

It is made with a calf's head &#8212; and that's no joke. Calves&#8217; heads are available at well&#8208;supplied butcher shops in metropolitan areas &#8212; and the reason for the name is that the meat of a cooked calf's head has much the same texture as that of turtle in real turtle soup. The ingredients for the dish include the classic spices that provide the flavor of real tle soup. After you have made a kettle of mock turtle soup, you can put it to a marvelous second use, as the base of Lady Curzon's soup. This soup is otherwise almost impossible to make in certain areas of America, where the sale of canned turtle soup is forbidden by law because green turtles are among the endangered species of the world. Lady Curzon was a Chicagoan christened Mary Leiter in 1870. She became the wife of Lord Curzon, the British viceroy to India. As the vicereine, she occupied the most powerful position ever held by any American woman in the British empire. Position aside, it would be sufficient unto the day if she were responsible only for the creation of the soup that bears her name. It is irresistible.

The production is undoubtedly a faithful transcription of the play, \\"Heat Lightning,\\" but the stage work did not arouse much enthusiasm and the cinematic offspring is a drab melodrama with occasional flashes of forced comedy.This \\"Heat Lightning,\\" which is now decorating the Rialto screen, does not offer Miss MacMahon the opportunity she deserves, for although she gives a believable performance the rôle is not well suited to her. Aside from Olga, the part played by Miss MacMahon, the other characters seldom ring true. A Sheriff drives up in search of two murderers and on hearing two of Olga's customers talking about oil wells he at once takes it for granted that they are respectable individuals, when they are the men he is hunting. Girl hikers, who are taking advantage of a lift in an elderly man's automobile, do not hesitate to tell one of the gunmen how handsome they think he is. Everybody's friendly in the desert, apparently. But it chances that one of the criminals, George Schaffer, who besides helping to crack a bank's safe has killed one or two men, recognizes Olga as a girl he knew—and knew well—in Tulsa.Glenda Farrell and Ruth Donnelly appear as two ex-wives from Reno. They are driving East in their own car with a chauffeur, who finds his job too arduous, for even when the car is in the garage the two women want him to wait upon them. They, and also the chauffeur, broadcast the fact that they are traveling with a fortune in diamonds and Schaffer decides to rob the safe where he hears that the gems are to be placed. He is, however, a little too eager on this occasion, for Olga overhears Schaffer and his pal and promptly gets a pistol and sends a bullet through the heart of her former lover.Mervyn LeRoy, the director of \\"Heat Lightning,\\" was not in an imaginative mood when he handled his scenes. He does give glimpses of the lightning which give the story its title, but there are scenes wherein the murderers have an extraordinarily easy time deceiving other characters. Often it seems strange that they are not overheard, but there is none so stupid as a director's \\"puppet.\\"Ann Dvorak does well enough as Olga's sister, Myra. Preston Foster gives a glib portrayal as Schaffer. Miss Farrell and Miss Donnelly strive valiantly to be funny, but with little success. Frank McHugh, who plays the chauffeur for the divorcees, is not at his best.

The American Guides series they produced is today a collectible bookshelf of literary Americana and a monument to our small towns and back roads before the emergence of mass culture. So when Matt Weiland and Sean Wilsey decided to create a “road trip in book form” in 2006, they turned to the W.P.A. guides for inspiration. The two friends are heavy hitters on the belles-lettres circuit: Weiland is deputy editor of The Paris Review, and Wilsey is a longtime editor of the quarterly McSweeney’s. But you’ll still wonder how they managed to coerce or cajole so much talent into “State by State” (Ecco, $30).

There no longer remains much to be done with the wife and mother who gives way to a long-cherished desire to become another Duse, with the hapless husband who tries to keep her at home, with the riotous rehearsals of the amateur players or with the devastating opening night when the scenery topples, the actors become entangled with the props and false mustaches fall off.Comedy may be ageless, and it is unquestionably true that there always will be something irresistibly funny in the spectacle of a man falling into a mud puddle or a top hat being knocked from a dignified head by an urchin's snowball. But such laughter comes in spite of oneself, like that produced by the process of having the soles of one's feet tickled with a feather.\\"Doubting Thomas\\" uses the foot-tickling feather from start to finish. From the moment when Billie Burke stands before a mirror and recites, \\"Maybe I'm not what the world would call a good woman, but who are you to judge me?\\" not realizing that her maid is a shocked listener, to that when Mr. Rogers dons a beret, riding breeches and a polo shirt and imitates a \\"mature crooner\\"—the picture forces its laughs. Yesterday's audience responded as the producers must have desired, but the mirth had a hollow sound.Mr. Rogers is too good a humorist and too valuable as a homespun philosopher to be hidden under this type of story. His embarrassment over his wife's stage debut is matched by ours at his willingness to surrender his peculiar comic talents for the entirely unindividual and guaranteed sure-fire laugh-getting stunts that the picture employs.Giving the cast its due, the players without exception draw the fullest measure of comedy out of every stock situation. Miss Burke flutters her way through the rôle of the footlight-bitten Paula Brown","excerpt":"Alison Skipworth is splendid as Mrs. Pampinelli, the dramatic coach, and it may be of some interest to note that she had the same rôle when the play was presented; Sterling Holloway is extremely amusing as Spindler, the Eagle Scout and indispensable prop boy; and Andrew Tombes, Johnny Arthur, Gail Patrick and Fred Wallace help make the Little Theatre's first—and last—night show an occasion for merriment.

It is Bartlett Cormack's \\"The Racket,\\" and in it are Thomas Meighan (a police captain), Louis Wolheim (a high-powered bootlegger), and \\"Skeets\\" Gallagher (a reporter).The picture unfortunately comes at the end of a season somewhat overrun by melodramas and underworld mysteries and for that reason will likely not get the niche in the hall of fame it perhaps deserves. It is a high mark for other melodramatic aspirants to shoot at, however.The story is the ordinary one of the two bootleg kings who fight for supremacy in the territory legally governed by an honest police captain. One gang leader murders the other, then there is one. Finally he is killed as he tries to flee the rapidly approaching payment for his sins.Mr. Wolheim makes a very good rough and ready bootlegger—one who rides in high-powered cars and dresses in gaudy suits and overcoats. His expression of domineering contempt for the minions of the law—and for women—is just right.Mr. Meighan is a trifle young for the hard-boiled police captain it is his lot to follow, but after the picture is under way that fact is not noticeable. When he is transferred to an outlying precinct in return for trying to do his duty, his disgusted attitude is realistic.The error of introducing too much love interest into the picture is not made. To be sure there is a girl, a cabaret entertainer, upon whom the unfolding of the plot eventually hinges, but she walks out alone at the conclusion. Her parting from the young reporter should be the end of the play, not the soliloquy of the captain that he needs sleep but when he is finished work \\"it will be time for mass.\\"There are several excellent touches in the picture. At the very beginning a macabre effect is introduced by the use of half shades—a method which also immediately precedes the street battle between the two gangs. The police stations also, for a change, resemble police stations and not municipal buildings.For those who worried about it when \\"The Racket\\" was still a stage play, the reporter who is personified by Mr. Gallagher retained his American Mercury and bottle of Scotch.On the stage Paul Ash is still leading the Paramount Stage Orchestra the offering being \\"Ocean Blues,\\" which is devised and staged by R.

Thirty more units in 20 houses are either under renovation or awaiting it. \\n\\nMost of the properties have been acquired and renovated in stable neighborhoods for about $49,000 apiece.

Tenants contribute 30 percent of their incomes to cover rent averaging $425 a month. The rest comes from Federal Section 8 funds.\\n\\nThe contract is vigorously enforced, Ms. Christian said. Two families were evicted and several others left voluntarily after failing to meet it, she said. \\n\\nWhen the program began, Dignity anticipated having 215 units finished and 100 under renovation by now, Ms. Christian said. But three City Council members from middle-class neighborhoods exercised their veto power over purchases in their districts, prompting Dignity to file Federal discrimination suits against them. The agency settled the last of the suits out of court last summer.\\n\\nThe suits alleged that the three Council members -- Jack Kelly and James Tayoun and Joan Krajewski -- blocked purchases because they are white, their districts are predominantly white and the people in the program are \\"homeless and/or black.\\"\\n\\nThe Council members contended they were concerned only about Dignity's abilty to maintain the properties.\\n\\nThe settlements authorize Dignity to buy 17 specific houses from a list of 163 presented to the Council members by the redevelopment authority. . But the year delay meant some houses went to other buyers, said Patricia Smith, deputy executive director of the redevelopment authority. Others suffered damage that made them too costly to rehabilitate. \\n\\nOnly nine were acquired and the redevelopment authority must now draw up a new list of houses from which to choose eight more.

During this month, the store-lined halls of Park Avenue Plaza on Saturday afternoons are filled with the live sounds of music from the Swing Era. This year, the music is provided by the band led by Buck Clayton, the trumpet star of the ensemble Count Basie brought to New York from Kansas City in the mid-1930's. In fact, the Basie band had its first major success in New York at the Famous Door club, two blocks west of where Park Avenue Plaza now stands. Mr. Clayton has been concentrating on arranging since he stopped playing trumpet almost 20 years ago, and his band now keeps the Basie tradition fresh with a repertory of his new arrangements and gems from the early Basie repertory. Tea will be served while the Clayton band plays, from 3 to 6 P.M. tomorrow and next Saturday. The tea, the music and, of course, browsing in the shops are free","excerpt":"all are sponsored by the New York Swing Band Society and the shops at Park Avenue Plaza. Lights, Camera, Music     Herman Foster and Jay Leonhart, Village Gate Terrace, Bleecker and Thompson Streets, Manhattan, (212) 475-5120. One link between Herman Foster and Erroll Garner that led Mr. Foster to be considered in the pianistic tradition of Garner is the influence of film scores on both pianists. The lush, sweeping romanticism of sound tracks in the 1930's and 40's colors their treatment of ballads and adds startling exclamations to their swinging uptempo excursions. When Mr. Foster is joined at the Village Gate Terrace this weekend by the bassist Jay Leonhart, another element is added: the sound and sight of Mr. Leonhart refreshing himself. Mr. Leonhart plays so many kinds of music so well that he only occasionally finds himself in a jazz situation. \\"When I get to play with Herman,\\" Mr. Leonhart said, \\"I feel like a jazz musician again.\\" They are to be joined in jazz from 10 P.M. to 3 A.M. today and tomorrow and from 10 P.M. to 2 A.M. on Sunday. There is a $6 minimum but no cover charge.   A Jazzman's Son     John Hammond Jr., Zanzibar and Grill, 550 Third Avenue, at 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 779-0606. The music of John Hammond Jr. should have been jazz, because his father was the record producer John Hammond, who was noted for his development of the careers of such jazz stars as Count Basie, Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman, Charlie Christian and Teddy Wilson. But the son was attracted by another, less publicized interest of his father: the earthy country blues. He started singing them when he had a blues radio program in college, and he has been on the road with the blues for 20 years since. He plans to offer his store of songs by Robert Johnson, Big Bill Broonzy, Sleepy John Estes, Blind Willie McTell and others to the Zanzibar and Grill at 10 and midnight today and tomorrow. Admission is $10, and there is a one-drink minimum at the bar and a one-entree minimum at tables. Week's Jazz Album     Doc Cheatham and Jim Galloway: \\"At the Bern Jazz Festival\\" (Sackville; Sackville Recordings , Box 87, Station J, Toronto, Ontario M4J 4X8, Canada). Doc Cheatham was in the company of a group largely made up of Canadians when he went to the Bern Jazz Festival in Switzerland in 1983. He had a superb rhythm section made up of the bassist Neil Swainson and the drummer Terry Clarke and a lesser-known but volatile pianist, Ian Bargh. In addition, the Scottish-born soprano saxophonist Jim Galloway, who now lives in Canada, and Roy Williams, a broad-toned boisterous English trombonist, were in the lineup. Most of the tunes are from the traditional jazz repertory with a leaning toward Louis Armstrong, but this group plays them with enough sincerity and joy to give them fresh validity. Mr. Galloway is a particularly life-giving soloist, and Mr. Cheatham, in his late 70's at the time, treats the tunes, which were part of his early career, with the respect due old friends.

That's manifestly ridiculous. Weaver is cursed by many problems. He admits as much with almost a straight face, manfully fighting back the merriment that bubbles within him. He has four regular outfielders. Having a fourth may be ac ceptable for bridge, but it becomes awkward in a game that normally calls for three outfielders at a time. How does he shoehorn them all in? It's a pitiful situation. A midwinter trade with San Diego brought Pat Dobson Baltimore and the big right&#8208;handed pitcher has the poten tial to become a 20&#8208;game winner. Since the Orioles already have three 20&#8208;garners in Dave McNally, Mike Cuellar and Jim Palmer, an instant difficulty becomes apparent.
