Full-page advertisements in 13 major newspapers show a chart illustrating the loss of market share of regular Coke.   The association's ads ask for the support of consumers in a campaign to encourage Coca-Cola to use beet or cane sugar, instead of high fructose corn syrup in its products. In addition, the association wants consumers to know that Coca-Cola Classic, which was the reintroduced original Coke formula, really is not the original formula since sugar is not the sweetener.
