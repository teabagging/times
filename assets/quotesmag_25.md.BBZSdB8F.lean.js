The play, “Odchazeni” (“Leaving”), is about a chancellor who must re-adjust to civilian life and the loss of power after being forced out by his former deputy. (Mr. Havel, now 71, whose last presidential term ended in 2003, has said he wrote most of the play before taking office.) It alludes to “King Lear” and “The Cherry Orchard” but has some postmodern touches: the playwright himself appears in a recorded voice-over. The play received mostly positive reviews in the Czech press. But this highly anticipated absurdist comedy was marred by some personal drama when Mr. Havel’s wife, Dagmar Havlova, who he said helped inspire the work, was barred from performing in it.
