Elliott (\\"Sanctions Will Bite -- and Soon,\\" Op-Ed, Jan. 14) drew conclusions about the effect of sanctions on Iraq that go well beyond what their evidence shows. They have looked at 115 cases in which sanctions were used, but as they acknowledge, they are not acquainted with Iraq's economy. I am, as the former desk officer for Iraq at the International Monetary Fund, and I have done a detailed study of the effect of sanctions on Iraq, published by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.   Those of us inside and outside the Government who know Iraq's economy agree almost entirely about the impact of sanctions on it. Iraq is becoming a poorer and militarily weaker country day by day, and the food situation will be critical in May just before the wheat and barley harvest, which will give Iraq enough cereals to last until fall or winter. This, however, does not tell us whether Saddam Hussein cares enough about the growing poverty of his people to leave Kuwait.   I would hate to see us base our policy toward any country on an average of what has happened in the last 115 similar cases. Historical analogies are interesting but not decisive. Furthermore, Mr. Hufbauer and Ms. Elliott have an intriguing idea of how to read the record of the past. Among their 34 percent of successful cases of sanctions are World War I, World War II and the Falkland war. I wonder how many professional historians would agree with their judgment that sanctions made an important contribution to the outcome of those conflicts.
