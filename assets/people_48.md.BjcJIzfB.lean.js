By one count, upwards of 700 different fables can be found in the Aesopic literature, and I think even a casual reader would benefit from a gloss to the text when new editions come out.

Cocteau Twins and Luna performed at a sold-out Roseland on Saturday night. They are two bands that couldn't be farther apart, and they're two bands that, from their recordings, shouldn't have been able to put on a convincing show at all.   Cocteau Twins, from Scotland and a product of the early 1980's, headlined the concert and were the young crowd's favorites. The band is a pure studio creation, and its recordings are all about obscurantism and distance. The band makes recordings drenched in echo. Referents -- like instruments, for instance -- hardly exist. The music has a soft metallic drone to it that floats and is all suggestive and never declarative. The band's singer, Elizabeth Fraser, emotes songs that at times sound completely made up of aimless vowels and consonants, with rhythms that imply words, but never actually form them. The music is all gesture, a great dramatic exhalation.

Jonathan Donahue, the singer and guitarist in Buffalo's Mercury Rev, played in the Flaming Lips, a 10-year-old band from Oklahoma City, for a year and a half.         The two bands also have their differences. At Irving Plaza, the Flaming Lips  made very clear demarcations between their noisy, spiraling jams and their vocals, turning down the intensity and distortion whenever Wayne Coyne began singing in his cracking voice. At the concert by Mercury Rev, Mr. Donahue's voice was used as a background instrument, enabling the band to string multiple  songs together into one long jam with forward motion.

How many people must be in a room before the chances are better than 50-50 that some pair of them have the same birthday?    A.Twenty-three, assuming that an equal number of people are born on every day of the year, and that no one is born on Feb. 29. The answer was supplied by Prof. Daniel Kleitman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose desk computer can handle quickly the rather large numbers required to arrive at the answer. But the principle is this: Consider one person, alone in a room. What is the chance his birthday is different from that of everybody else in the room? That chance is 100 percent. Now a second person enters. One birthday is already occupied, so what is the second person's chance    his    birthday is different from that of everybody already in the room? That probability is given by the fraction 364/365, which is equal to a 99.73 percent chance. Now a third person enters","excerpt":"two birthdays are occupied already, so the chance for the third person that his birthday is different from that of both the others is 363/365, or 99.45 percent. However, the total probability that no two people have the same birthday is the    product    of all the individual probabilities of not having the same birthday as someone else. For three people, that is 364/365 multiplied by 363/365, or 132,132/ 133,225. If a fourth person enters, his individual probability is 362/365; the total probability, 364/365 times 363/ 365 times 362/365, or 47,831,784/ 48,627,125, which is 98.36 percent.

He was 83 years old.    He apparently died of a heart attack, his family said.   In 1935, Mr. Cowan, who had been executive director of the motion picture academy, became production supervisor of John Ford's 1935 film \\"The Whole Town's Talking,\\" which starred Edward G. Robinson and Jean Arthur. Four years later, he produced the first of his own films, the W. C. Fields comedy \\"You Can't Cheat an Honest Man.\\" The next year, he produced \\"My Little Chickadee\\" with Fields and Mae West.  Of Serious Matters    On the dramatic side he produced \\"Ladies in Retirement\\" (1941), directed by Charles Vidor and starring Ida Lupino, Louis Hayward and Elsa Lanchester. His war films included \\"Commandos Strike at Dawn\\" with Paul Muni (1942), \\"Tomorrow the World\\" with Fredric March and Betty Field (1944) and \\"The Story of G.I. Joe\\" with Robert Mitchum and Burgess Meredith (1945).   Mr. Cowan, who was born in Mansfield, Ohio, was a student at Stanford University in the late 1920's when he went to Hollywood for a look at the film industry. He was hired by the motion picture academy in 1928, wrote a book on the advent of talkies and helped to start the annual Academy Awards.   After World War II, Mr. Cowan produced the musical \\"One Touch of Venus\\" (1948) and followed with \\"Love Happy\\" in 1950 and \\"Main Street to Broadway\\" in 1953.  Organizing a Research Council    In 1929, at the behest of the academy, he originated a lecture series for the University of Southern California: it was the first college course in film studies. He also organized the film industry's research council, which developed such technical standards as the size and shape of the screen image and which hired George Gallup to undertake the first audience research.   In 1962, Mr. Cowan went to Moscow to begin the first Soviet-American co-production arrangement. Work was begun on filming \\"Meeting at a Far Mountain,\\" from a novel published simultaneously in the United States and the Soviet Union, but the project foundered.

Mr. Tetzlaff, a 29-year-old German violinist, has an exquisitely focused sound and seemingly limitless agility. He avoids many of the compromises natural to violin playing: he tends to play chords solid rather than broken, and he uses slurs reluctantly, preferring to articulate every note distinctly even in the swiftest passages.

Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in the zarzuela, led by a remarkable group of Spanish operatic singers who grew up on it. Placido Domingo and Victoria de los Angeles, to name two, have been doughty campaigners for this neglected art form.   Now the record companies are starting to catch up.

The first cloud with which Thomson and his librettist, the poet Jack Larson, had to contend was the cult fervor surrounding Thomson's first two operas. Both \\"Four Saints in Three Acts\\" (1934) and \\"The Mother of Us All\\" (1947) had librettos by Gertrude Stein. \\"The Mother of Us All,\\" about the life of the suffragette Susan B.

On May 31, 1963, Pierre Monteux conducted the London Symphony Orchestra and the pianist John Ogdon in an all-Tchaikovsky concert at the Vienna Festival, comprising \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" the First Piano Concerto and the Fifth Symphony. For reasons no one has been able to reconstruct, the American Vanguard label recorded the performance but then filed away the tapes.   Monteux died 13 months later. Ogdon, who in 1962 had shared the Tchaikovsky Competition's gold medal with Vladimir Ashkenazy, made a respectable career as an individualistic interpreter with a huge technique, and died in 1989. Some of the London Symphony's principals -- Barry Tuckwell, for example, who rendered the horn solo in the Andante Cantabile of the Fifth Symphony with velvety smoothness -- went on to greater glory as soloists.

Review/Theater","excerpt":"Two Characters in Search of an Offstage Chekhov"},{"year":"1996","title":"Two men, strangers to each other, identified only as the Dealer and the Client, meet under the cover of urban night. The Dealer (Patrice Chereau) is a stocky fellow in an overcoat that looks to be one size too big. He moves quickly and talks fast, as if he had said everything countless times before. His is a spiel of Jesuitical intensity. He's a hustler who seems ever on the edge of attack, but at the beginning he's satisfied to read the other man's thoughts.         The Client (Pascal Greggory), who's younger and better dressed, his head shaved, appears to be trapped in the glare of the Dealer's logic. Though the Dealer never identifies what he's selling, and the Client refuses to acknowledge that he's buying, sex initially seems to be the unnamed commodity. Yet as the two continue to circle each other, taunting, challenging and insinuating, one thing emerges from the fog of words: they're analyzing virtually all of the emotional bargains a man can strike in a lifetime that must end in a draw, which is death.

In July, the same owners opened a second property, the stripped-down, industrial-chic Hotel Básico, along the town's pedestrian Avenida Quinta, a block from the beach. An open-air, street-level food stall and juice bar doubles as the reception area, where colorful soccer balls, beach towels and snorkeling fins for guest use share shelf space with espresso machines and water glasses. A trawling net filled with spare deck chairs hangs whimsically above the soaring lobby.    THE ROOMS -- The 15 rooms all have female names. Mine, the Paulina, had floor-to-ceiling windows and a sea view, but looked out more immediately at the vacant lot across the street. There is a distinctly modern beach flair: white concrete walls are hung with huge inflatable inner tubes, flat-screen televisions and stacks of towels. Instead of a night table, a wooden toolbox mounted on the wall opens to reveal a remote control, a notepad, matches, an ashtray and Polaroid film for the white camera that is attached to the king-size bed, rather naughtily, by a long silver chain. Cushy pillow-top mattresses, oversized pillows and pristine white cotton sheets are extremely comfortable, but a good night's sleep is best assured with earplugs, as the upstairs bar spins music into the wee hours. There is not a lot of storage space, but luggage racks and hidden drawers slide out from under the bed.    THE BATHROOM  -- In each room, a heavy blond-wood door with a saw handle leads to a small separate toilet, which has a mini disco-ball on a chain as a flushing mechanism. The sink and bathtub share the bedroom space, but manage to do it without feeling too crowded.    THE LOCATION -- Playa's Fifth Avenue, as the street is called, is lined with shops -- including standard souvenir shacks, trendy chains like Diesel, and distinctive local boutiques specializing in cigars and premium-grade tequila -- and an endless parade of tacky restaurants and bars.    AMENITIES -- Free wireless Internet access is available throughout the property, and desktop computers are available in the basement office. A second-floor restaurant specializes in seafood, but the coolest hangout by far is the rooftop lounge, which features a bar","excerpt":"two circular pools 10 feet in diameter (more like deep tubs, since you can't really swim in them); four-poster vinyl beach beds shielded by airy cotton sheets; hammocks; and plenty of deck chairs. Beware of the beds on windy days: on a recent afternoon, a whipping sheet dislodged and broke one of the atmospheric hanging lightbulbs. But a soak in the pool, with piña colada in hand and sublime views of the Caribbean and Cozumel in the distance, is certainly a great way to pass an afternoon. There is no gym on site, but guests can pay $12 for entrance to Area Body Zone, a modern facility down the street. Guests have free access to Mamita's, a tony beach club a 15-minute walk north along the shore (it is the type of place that has Mercedes-Benz-sponsored fashion shows on the beach).    ROOM SERVICE -- Prompt and friendly, but unnecessary, since there is a restaurant, bar and cafe at the hotel, and plenty of choices in the immediate vicinity. And with nowhere to put a tray except the rubber-tire-covered pullout table at the foot of the bed, it is infinitely more pleasant to dine outside.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- Hotel Básico, Avenida Quinta and Calle 10 Norte, www.hotelbasico.com, (52-984) 879-4448, is not right on the beach, but it offers a central location, a friendly staff and an excellent food and bar scene. It is ideal for hipsters and young couples on a romantic getaway looking for something different in tropical-themed rooms with a playful minimalist air.

Mr. O'Donnell, a former reporter, had been the most prominent government press aide in the state  for nearly 30 years. He had been a top aide in 11 statewide campaigns for president, governor and senator and two New York City mayoral campaigns.

The men  and women compete head-to-head in all events, equestrian riders reach their prime in their mid-30's and half of the athletes are horses. But aside from what makes equestrian so different, there are traits it shares with the other sports. Even basketball fans can appreciate the elegance of dressage, the thrills of show jumping and the intestinal fortitude of the three-day event. THE SCORING Olympic competition consists of three disciplines: dressage, show jumping and three-day event. All three have team and individual competitions. In dressage, judges score the competitors on a series of moves, called a test, at designated areas around the ring. The percentage of a perfect score is then calculated. Usually, the medalists score in the 70-80 percent range. The top 24  individuals advance to the Gran Prix Special, of which the top 12 advance to the freestyle. The scores are added to determine the individual medalists.          In the show-jumping event, the competitor with the fewest faults wins. Downing any part of a jump or putting a hoof in water will result in four faults. If a horse refuses a jump, three faults are given, the second refusal, 6 points, and a disqualification is assessed for the third. The scoring of the three-day event (which really takes four days","excerpt":"two days for show jumping and the endurance events, and two days for dressage) would take three days to explain, so here are the basics: Everything is computed in penalty points.
