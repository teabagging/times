For a while, in the late 1980's and early 1990's, that was possible.  ''AMERICAN REVOLUTIONS: THE HIGHWAYMEN,'' Friday night at 8 on CMT, is a one-hour special about the four-man supergroup, including previously unseen film clips from their last recording session, in 1994.    Shakespeare and Company, the English-language bookstore on Rue de la Bücherie in Paris, has almost nothing to do with the shop of the same name that SYLVIA BEACH ran in the 1920's and 30's on Rue de l'Odéon, except that Beach left the rights to the name to its American expatriate owner, GEORGE WHITMAN. But the ''new'' place (1951 to the present) has its own mystique. Anyway, the SUNDANCE CHANNEL's ''PORTRAIT OF A BOOKSTORE AS AN OLD MAN'' (Monday, 9 p.m.) is really about Mr. Whitman, in his 90's now and apparently as irascible as ever.    All the World War II 60th anniversaries recently passed, and the HISTORY CHANNEL still had a five-part documentary mini-series lying around. Maybe that's why it decided to run all of ''HITLER'S MANAGERS'' at once (Saturday, 7 p.m. to midnight). These are the men who ran things in the Third Reich -- Alfred Krupp (arms), Albert Speer (architecture), Ferdinand Porsche (vehicles) and Wernher von Braun (rockets) -- along with Alfred Jodl, the general who signed the surrender.    MTV could be credited with (and blamed for) the reality epidemic, thanks to ''THE REAL WORLD,'' which started back in 1992. The newest series, beginning Thursday (10:00 p.m.), is ''RUN'S HOUSE,'' an ''Osbournes''-like look at the home life of Joey Simmons, aka REVEREND RUN of RUN DMC. He has five children, and a new CD to promote (related article, Page 4).

Stephen Colbert will aim his arched left eyebrow at satirizing Fox News's ''O'Reilly Factor,'' applying the same bullheaded bluster to analyzing current events that he perfected during his years with Jon Stewart on ''The Daily Show.''    Girls compete for a college scholarship, as well as an internship at Seventeen magazine, in a contest adjudicated by ATOOSA RUBENSTEIN, the magazine's youthful and culture-savvy editor. From the teaser clips, ''MISS SEVENTEEN'' (Monday at 10:30 p.m.) looks like MTV's next addictive reality show. Ms. Rubenstein gives them assignments, à la ''The Apprentice,'' but she also gets to spy on the stylish aspirants when they don't know anyone is watching. How evil. ''I don't want to be affiliated with a house of liars,'' one says tearfully in the trailer. How excellent.    In a different kind of costume drama, BBC AMERICA will broadcast the American premiere of  ''BYRON'' (Saturday at 9), a 2003 biopic. JONNY LEE MILLER (Sick Boy from ''Trainspotting'') plays the saucy, sodomizing poet, whose dissolute lifestyle and enduring love for his half-sister (NATASHA LITTLE) are engagingly dramatized here. Also on BBC America is a marathon of the Season 2 episodes of ''LITTLE BRITAIN'' (Sunday, beginning at 2 p.m.), the sketch comedy show that hasn't lived up to the hype -- it's not the next ''Office'' -- but whose broad gross-out humor is funny nonetheless.    In ''A WALK IN YOUR SHOES: KATRINA'S AFTERMATH'' (THE N, Tuesday at 9 p.m.), the serious-minded teenage documentary series abandons its usual format of two kids swapping lives. Instead, it follows a day in the lives of five high schoolers from Metairie, La., 10 days after the hurricane decimated their homes and displaced them.

SIMPSON was found not guilty of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. PBS's ''FRONTLINE: THE O.J. VERDICT'' (Tuesday at 9 p.m.) looks back at the trial, and why its combined elements -- celebrity, race, wealth and murder -- were so enthralling. Talking heads like JEFFREY TOOBIN, who covered the case for The New Yorker, and CHARLES OGLETREE, a Harvard law professor, examine everything from the charisma of Johnnie Cochran to ugly truths the trial uncovered about America's racial divide.    The teenage soap opera ''ONE TREE HILL'' begins its third season in a new time slot (WB, Wednesday at 8 p.m.). In the finale in May, an unknown arsonist tried to kill Dan (PAUL JOHANSSON), Peyton (HILARIE BURTON) met her biological mother and Haley (BETHANY JOY LENZ) appeared at Nathan's (JAMES LAFFERTY) doorstep after having ditched him to go on tour with MICHELLE BRANCH's band, the Wreckers.    Speaking of bands, DIDDY is still trying to put one together on ''MAKING THE BAND 3'' (MTV, Thursday at 10 p.m.) After auditioning a number of young women during the show's spring run, he decided all but three weren't worth his time, and sent the rest home. In the next 10 episodes, he will continue the search.    If you've ever wanted to see an animated bulldog compose a love letter to Tim Robbins, you're in luck. Sundance's jaw-droppingly funny six-part series ''I AM NOT AN ANIMAL'' (Wednesday at 11 p.m.), originally on BBC TWO, introduces a cast of genetically engineered talking animals trying to make their way in the world outside the lab. STEVE COOGAN (''24 Hour Party People'') is an executive producer, as well as the voice of two of the animals: a horse who loves to read while on the toilet, and a sparrow who wants a recording contract with Geffen Records.

This has never been clearer or more disturbing than now, especially when considering the HISTORY CHANNEL's two-part documentary ''THE CRUSADES: CRESCENT AND THE CROSS'' (Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m.). Roughly 900 years ago, some Christians, inspired by POPE URBAN II, got the idea that their religion was superior to everyone else's and set out to conquer the Muslim world. These re-creation-style documentaries have a tendency to concentrate on the details, battle by battle and general by general. Some meaning would be good, too.    Sunday's episode of ''THE WEST WING'' (NBC at 8 p.m.) will be a particular challenge for ALAN ALDA and JIMMY SMITS. Special live episodes don't have a great track record for excitement, but this idea has potential. Mr. Alda, as the Republican candidate for president, and Mr. Smits, as his Democratic opponent, meet for a televised debate. Both characters have intense screen presence, which is a good start.    CBS's two-part superstorm movie ''CATEGORY 7: THE END OF THE WORLD'' (Sunday and Nov. 13 at 9 p.m.) exists for one very good reason. Last year, the first night of ''CATEGORY 6: DAY OF DESTRUCTION'' brought in more than 19.4 million viewers, and the second night grabbed about 16.7 million. Critics were not kind, but since when is sweeps month about art? In the first movie, Chicago bit the dust. In the sequel, the disaster goes global. GINA GERSHON plays the director of FEMA.

ANNE-MARIE DUFF, who played one of the brutalized teenage girls in the 2002 film ''The Magdalene Sisters,'' shows she's up for it in this week's ''MASTERPIECE THEATER'' (PBS, Sunday at 9 p.m.). In ''THE VIRGIN QUEEN,'' a two-part co-production with the BBC, Ms. Duff's Elizabeth is a crafty schemer: she goes from the prison tower to the maze of court politics with a hint of a smirk.    ''LAGUNA BEACH'' provides a weekly examination of a different, but equally cunning queen bee -- following the high-school reign of the charismatic, fear-inducing KRISTIN CAVALLARI. On Monday's Season 2 finale (at 10 p.m.), MTV's chronicling of her senior year will conclude. The channel is milking this last hurrah: a marathon of the whole season begins at 12:30 p.m., and instead of commercials, the finale will interlace live segments of the cast members in front of an audience at MTV's Times Square studios.    ''THE 39TH ANNUAL CMA AWARDS'' (CBS, Tuesday at 8 p.m.) has scheduled ELTON JOHN and DOLLY PARTON to perform two songs together, one of which will be her cover of John Lennon's ''Imagine.'' If that seems weird for country music's biggest award show -- and it sure does, though perhaps intriguingly so -- other acts on the slate are more customary, like BIG & RICH and LEE ANN WOMACK. Last year's entertainer of the year, KENNY CHESNEY, who was married to Renée Zellweger for 10 minutes, is also on the list of performers, and is once again nominated in that category.    HBO has been rerunning ''THE WIRE,'' the highly praised, little watched, crazily confusing crime series, on Tuesday and Thursday nights. This week the Season 2 repeats begin (HBO Zone, Thursday at 11 p.m.), in which the detectives found themselves investigating organized crime, sex trafficking and a corrupt dockworkers' union.

The dashing Mr. Everett takes on the role Sunday in ''SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE CASE OF THE SILK STOCKING'' (PBS, 9 p.m., check local listings), in which a missing debutante turns up dead in a prostitute's clothes.    TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES is serious about its Hitchcock Week, beginning on Monday night. TCM will show 36 ALFRED HITCHCOCK films, from ''BLACKMAIL'' (1929), a British silent-talkie hydrid, to ''FAMILY PLOT'' (1976), his last and one of his worst. All the classics are included, as are the ice-cool blondes (Kelly, Novak, Hedren, even Carole Lombard) for whom Hitch had a slightly creepy fixation. Of special note to Americans should be ''Hitchcock in Britain,'' on Wednesdays, with early films, like ''THE SKIN GAME'' (1931) and ''JAMAICA INN'' (1939), that are less known here.    None of the directors involved in SHOWTIME's ''Masters of Horror'' (beginning Friday at 10 p.m.) are exactly the new Hitchcock, but suspense is their métier. Thirteen men, including TOBE HOOPER (''Poltergeist'') and JOHN CARPENTER (''Halloween''), have made a one-hour film for this series. It begins with ''INCIDENT ON AND OFF A MOUNTAIN ROAD,'' from DON COSCARELLI (''Phantasm'' and the intriguingly named ''Bubba Ho-tep'').    BBC AMERICA likes to compare Blackpool, England, the setting of ''VIVA BLACKPOOL,'' to Atlantic City, because it's a run-down seaside town that one man wants to turn into the next Las Vegas. DAVID MORRISSEY plays the would-be Donald Trump, who has family problems and a little glitch: a corpse turns up the day after his casino's grand opening. Oh, and it's a musical: the first episode (Monday, 10 p.m.) includes ''THESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKING'' and other favorites.

The love-it-or-hate-it HBO series is breathing its last on Sunday (9 p.m.) after five seasons. With the death of Nate (PETER KRAUSE), who was the show's axis, the Fishers and their extended family must find closure, both for their sakes and ours. A two-part retrospective, ''SIX FEET UNDER: 2001-2005,'' began showing last week, but it is on again on Sunday at 8 p.m., preceding the 75-minute finale.    For those who hate being outside, Sunday offers three all-day cable marathons. On USA, eight reruns of ''LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT'' begin at 1 p.m. True-crime fans can watch them while flipping back and forth from the eight-part documentary ''THE STAIRCASE'' (also starting at 1 p.m., on the Sundance Channel). This epic examination of the trial of MICHAEL PETERSON, a novelist who was accused of his wife's 2001 murder, is a character study that doesn't draw conclusions. For a smuttier afternoon, BBC AMERICA rebroadcasts all the episodes of the British soap opera ''FOOTBALLERS' WIVES'' (1 p.m.) that have been shown so far. They are worth watching in their own right, but added incentive is the character named Chardonnay (SUSIE MAY).    This week, PBS's ''P.O.V.'' series presents the broadcast premiere of ''BRIGHT LEAVES'' (Tuesday at 10 p.m.), the documentary by ROSS McELWEE (''Sherman's March'') about the North Carolina tobacco industry. Through the story of his great-grandfather -- who created the brand Bull Durham, only to be overtaken by the Duke family -- Mr. McElwee eviscerates the culture of tobacco. But his flinty wit makes it all good television.    The director KEVIN SMITH appears as himself on three episodes of ''DEGRASSI: THE NEXT GENERATION.'' His run concludes on Friday (N, 8 p.m.), as does the show's fourth season.

Will Melanie (MICHELLE CLUNIE) and Lindsay (THEA GILL) move to Canada because they're so afraid of the Bush administration?

And on cable, Season 3 of ''NIP/TUCK'' starts this week (FX, Tuesday at 10 p.m.). The 90-minute episode is likely to thrill fans: Christian (JULIAN McMAHON) has survived his encounter with the Carver, a serial mutilator and rapist, but is even more of an emotional disaster, and is unable to work. And Sean (DYLAN WALSH) has his own problems. Julia (JOELY RICHARDSON) wants a divorce, and his son Matt (JOHN HENSLEY) is reeling after his affair with his life coach (FAMKE JANSSEN), whom he doesn't even know (yet) is a transsexual.    The conspiracy theorists who cried foul when KELLY MONACO won ''DANCING WITH THE STARS'' over JOHN O'HURLEY will get a second chance during the rematch (ABC, Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. and Thursday at 9 p.m.). ABC Family is rebroadcasting all six episodes of this unlikely ratings smash Sunday (starting at 1 p.m.). As for a personal prediction on the grudge match, to borrow from Howard Cosell: ''Down goes Monaco! Down goes Monaco!''    People don't talk about ''NCIS'' often, even though it's a successful ensemble mystery with a strong lead character (MARK HARMON). Is it simply too confusing that the show's name shares three of the ''CSI'' letters? The military crime series's second season ended with a shock: Kate (SASHA ALEXANDER), a beloved member of the team, was shot in the head. (Apparently, that's what you get when you ask to be released from your contract, as Ms. Alexander had.) Season 3 has its premiere on Tuesday (CBS, 8 p.m.).    ''THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW''  returns Monday (check local listings), beginning its 20th season. Ms. Winfrey's past premieres have been distinguished by her sponsors' lavish gifts to the audience. In addition to surprise riches, they'll also be treated to a heart-to-heart with her first guest of the season, Jennifer Aniston.

One of Mr. Scorsese's many talents is the ability to evoke a past era (in this case, 1961-66) viscerally. So the film, punctuated with long-ago, previously unseen performances, isn't just about Mr. Dylan, now 64. It's about what he meant.    On Sunday at 9 p.m., ABC's ''DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES'' reaches the horrible moment that comes to every hit series: the second-season premiere, after which everything will be compared unfavorably with the past. The show has already gone in a couple of desperate-soap-writer directions, with a hostage situation (JAMES DENTON will surely rescue TERI HATCHER from it), a prison sentence (for RICARDO ANTONIO CHAVIRA) and an accompanying demand (made to EVA LONGORIA) for a paternity test.    If the role fits, you must stick with it. YUL BRYNNER did it as the King of Siam, and CYBILL SHEPHERD is giving it a try as MARTHA STEWART. She played Ms. Stewart in a 2003 television movie. Now, in ''MARTHA: BEHIND BARS'' (CBS, Sunday night at 9), she stars in the story of Ms. Stewart's five months in a federal prison and the events that led her there. Chances are her character will not be shouting at anybody on her staff about merlot.    Have the producers of ''WILL & GRACE'' learned nothing from the live ''E.R.'' episode, from JULIE ANDREWS and CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER in the CBS ''ON GOLDEN POND,'' from GEORGE CLOONEY's ''FAIL SAFE''? Apparently not, because they're doing their season premiere (NBC, Thursday at 8:30 p.m.) live. ERIC STOLTZ guest-stars as a married man who may tempt Grace (DEBRA MESSING) into an affair.

The DISCOVERY CHANNEL is going the dramatic re-creation route with ''THE FLIGHT THAT FOUGHT BACK'' (Sunday at 9 p.m.), the story of United Airlines Flight 93 out of Newark, on which passengers banded together to stop the terrorists who had hijacked the plane. The documentary balances the re-creation scenes (including an attack with a food cart) with interviews. Relatives of the passengers who died while preventing a greater disaster bring the special some dignity.    The HISTORY CHANNEL commemorates the anniversary by honoring a hero on the ground. The subject of ''THE MAN WHO PREDICTED 9/11'' (Sunday at 8 p.m.) is RICK RESCORLA, the British-born director of security at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who had warned authorities in 1993 that there would be another attack. He led hundreds out of the World Trade Center to safety before losing his own life when the South Tower collapsed.    ''THE SIMPSONS,'' the amazing animated series created by MATT GROENING, just keeps going. Its 17th season begins on Sunday (Fox, 8 p.m.) with Marge, possibly the most unappreciated wife and mother on television, leaving Homer after his latest stupid stunt and falling for a handsome marine biologist (the voice of ALEC BALDWIN). The episode title is ''Bonfire of the Manatees.''    Fans of ''GILMORE GIRLS,'' which imagines a beautiful young Connecticut single mother and her beautiful college-age daughter as Noël Coward-clever wits, have been living with a real cliffhanger. In the last moments of the season finale, Lorelai (LAUREN GRAHAM), the mom, proposed to her diner-owner lover, Luke (SCOTT PATTERSON). Faithful viewers don't really believe Luke would say no, but who knew the daughter (ALEXIS BLEDEL) would even think of dropping out of Yale? The season premiere is Tuesday at 8 p.m. on WB.

Maybe this season all the stories won't seem so excruciatingly alike. Mr. Uva is proposing to his girlfriend of 10 years, who has finally had it with his failure to commit. The half-hour also includes sailing lessons, group bouquet-making and a jury duty theme (that's how the couple met). The show's impish fashion expert, CARSON KRESSLEY, makes a dangerous comment: ''Sometimes no is just a slow yes.'' Luckily he's talking about replies to marriage proposals.    JON VOIGHT plays the title character of ''POPE JOHN PAUL II'' (CBS, Sunday at 9 p.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m.), not a role you'd think he was born to play. He makes a thoroughly convincing John Paul in this two-part biography of the first Polish pontiff, whose 26-year papacy brought conservatism back to the Vatican. But after an assassination-attempt prologue, viewers will have to wait a long time to see Mr. Voight. CARY ELWES plays the future pope in most of the first half.    ''SLEEPER CELL,'' a 10-hour SHOWTIME mini-series about Islamic terrorists in Los Angeles, will begin stirring up fears Sunday night at 10. MICHAEL EALY (Ricky in the film ''Barbershop'') plays Darwyn al-Hakim, the cell's newest recruit but really an undercover F.B.I. agent. Between now and the two-hour finale on Dec. 18, the group will plan an anthrax attack on a shopping mall, befriend a pesticide-plant worker, buy explosives from white supremacists and hijack a chemical truck.

STEPHEN FRY stars as the frightening (but secretly thoughtful and well-intentioned) headmaster, who makes strong boys cry. The beautiful blond ALEX PETTYFER plays Tom. JOE BEATTIE plays Flashman, the chief bully, whose father gives a lot of money to the school.    The differences between ''THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE'' then and now? In the 1972 disaster film, the ship capsizes because it comes up against a tidal wave. A brave minister leads the escape attempt. In NBC's new version on Sunday at 8 p.m., with an ensemble cast that includes ADAM BALDWIN, STEVE GUTTENBERG, RUTGER HAUER, BRYAN BROWN and ALEX KINGSTON, the ship capsizes because of a terrorist attack. A priest leads the escape attempt, but a homeland security agent gets into the act too. Maybe it says something positive about age that SHELLEY WINTERS, whose character was basically used as one long fat joke, was a baby of 50 at the time. SYLVIA SYMS, who plays the Winters role this time around, is 71.    The rule about racial humor, as everyone knows, is that only a member of any particular oppressed group is allowed to make jokes about it. ''RACE IS THE PLACE,'' the ''INDEPENDENT LENS'' documentary on PBS stations Tuesday night at 10, puts a variation of that rule to good use. Performers include a Hawaiian writer who talks about being colonized by tourism, a comedian named Akmed who does a routine about his experiences with airport security and a white-haired man who plays the guitar and sings, ''I think that I shall never see/Any Chicanos on TV.''

Years later, he's made more shorts using this format, which will run as a nine-episode series. In one snippet of the first episode, a droll hamster named Fluffy says: ''If you're looking for a disco-dancing spring rabbit, then you would find me a bit boring. But if you are the kind of person who likes to sit around and moan a lot, then you could say I'm a fairly good companion.''    Viewers following DANNY BONADUCE's trip to drug- and alcohol-induced hell on ''BREAKING BONADUCE'' will have to bid him farewell in Sunday night's culmination (a marathon of the entire season begins at 4:30 p.m., leading to the finale at 9:30, on VH1). Mr. Bonaduce, who went into rehab after slashing his wrists during the filming of the series, has been trying to stay sober despite his continued dissatisfaction with his wife. Specifically, Mr. Bonaduce is an admitted sex addict and Mrs. Bonaduce hates sex. It's a problem.    The ''PRISON BREAK'' (FOX, Monday at 9 p.m.) gang isn't doing well, either. On the day before the breakout planned by Michael (WENTWORTH MILLER), Abruzzi (PETER STORMARE) may be dead and Lincoln (DOMINIC PURCELL) has been dragged away by guards.

That leads into ''SUNSET BOULEVARD'' (10:30 a.m.), the 1950 evisceration of Hollywood celebrity that is more relevant than ever. Then you've got a marathon of ''THE PHILADELPHIA STORY'' (12:30 p.m.), ''IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT'' (2:30 p.m.), ''CASABLANCA'' (4:30 p.m.) and the original ''KING KONG'' (6:15 p.m.). There is no reason to leave the couch.    Later that night, ''MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL'' on ABC will come to an end (Monday at 9 p.m.). Next season, ABC's Disney sibling ESPN will broadcast the Monday games. ABC's final program will be the New England Patriots playing the New York Jets.

But competitive shows like ''SURVIVOR,'' ''THE AMAZING RACE'' and ''THE APPRENTICE: DONALD TRUMP'' continue to draw audiences even if, particularly in Mr. Trump's case, they have shrunk. This week, the fall editions of this troika will have their finales. This ''Survivor'' (CBS, Sunday night ) has distinguished itself by bringing back two players from the previous season, STEPHENIE LAGROSSA and BOBBY JON DRINKARD, as well as its apparent attempt to actually kill all of the contestants on their first day, with an 11-mile race through the jungle in 100-degree heat. (Many vomited, though everyone somehow lived.)    ''The Amazing Race'' (CBS, Tuesday night) tried its first family edition, with four-person teams, and no detectable child abuse in pressure-filled situations. After showing viewers the world in previous seasons, this North America-only race has felt claustrophobic: the spring edition will go back to sending contestants to places they cannot pronounce. And ''The Apprentice'' (NBC, Thursday night) once again pitted men against women, after Mr. Trump decided that last season's educational divide (''book smarts versus street smarts'') wasn't as interesting as an old-fashioned gender war.    HBO's documentary ''DARE TO DREAM'' (Sunday night) chronicles the rise of the United States women's soccer team, from its underfinanced, underdog beginnings through its World Cup championship and Olympic gold medal. A more accurate title for this rousing story would have been ''I Dare You Not to Cry.''

TRACEY ULLMAN plays the central character, Princess Winnifred, not the delicate kind of young woman you'd think would have trouble with less than perfectly luxurious sleeping conditions. But in this musical version of ''THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA,'' the cast member that viewers will be watching most is CAROL BURNETT as the controlling Queen Aggravain. Ms. Burnett started her musical-comedy career playing Winnifred in the original 1959 New York stage production. Time flies when you're getting old.    Malcolm Harvey (TIMOTHY SPALL, who plays Wormtail in the latest Harry Potter movie) is one of those mild-mannered, middle-aged teachers who teenagers love to ridicule. The kids have their chance during a class trip to Salisbury Cathedral in ''MR. HARVEY LIGHTS A CANDLE'' (BBC AMERICA, Saturday at 8 p.m.). They also learn that yes, this fuddy-duddy did once have a personal life, a tragic one.    They call each other Redford and Newman. They kid each other like old friends, which they are. They plug the Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut shamelessly. ''ICONOCLASTS: ROBERT REDFORD ON PAUL NEWMAN'' (SUNDANCE CHANNEL, Thursday at 10 p.m.) may be partly a P.R. job for Mr. Newman's pet projects (the playhouse is actually a project of Joanne Woodward, his wife) with some praise thrown in for Mr. Redford's Sundance empire, but this interview is also an example of superstar chemistry. What these men had in their buddy films, ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' and ''The Sting,'' 30-odd years ago still comes across.

Mr. Foster does, in fact, terminate the brothers' account at the expensive Japanese restaurant.    That's only one offering among the continual unscripted summer rollout.

All along, Mr. Newhart's ordinary-man persona has been his genius. As LARRY GELBART says in the special, ''The big thing about Bob is, you think he's there to check the gas meter.''    Seeing BBC AMERICA's new series ''FOOTBALLERS' WIVES'' (which begins tonight at 9), it seems fair to infer that somebody abroad has been watching ''DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.'' But there are notable differences: haughtier men, more subjugated women, sports intrigue and shower scenes with male nudity.    ABC's admirable reality series ''THE SCHOLAR'' comes to an end on Monday (8 p.m.). After making a student film and competing to demonstrate the most pep (aka school spirit), one high school senior will win big. For once, a reality show's grand prize has some meaning. A full scholarship (including room, board and books) at the college of your choice beats the heck out of living like a Hilton for a year.    The intelligentsia do not exactly leap to attention at the announcement that PAULY SHORE has a new series (''Minding the Store,'' tonight at 10). But the first episode, in which Mr. Shore begins trying to save his family business, the Comedy Store, at least shows some imagination. He decides to create a theme night with beautiful women doing stand-up. But the big, ages-old question is, as Mr. Shore puts it, ''Can a hot chick be funny?''   THE WEEK AHEAD: July 17 -- July 23","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2005","title":"O.K., it probably won't be as historically revealing as the British import ''The 1900 House,'' but MTV's reality series ''THE 70'S HOUSE'' (beginning Tuesday night) may turn out to be fun. A dozen young people move in together (this part we've heard before) and live the way Americans did three decades ago. That means no cellphones, e-mail or iPods. But at least they could have cable.    Adrian Monk, the man who made obsessive-compulsive disorder lovable, returns for a fourth season of ''MONK'' on USA. Despite his condition, Adrian (TONY SHALHOUB) is the best clue detector since Sherlock Holmes. At least everyone thinks so until, in the season premiere (Friday night), he runs into another particularly clever detective (JASON ALEXANDER, fresh from his most recent failed sitcom).    They seem symbolic of the age we live in: the shapely young woman with a less than genius I.Q. and the brainy but socially challenged young man. The two teamed up recently on WB's ''BEAUTY AND THE GEEK'' for mutual improvement purposes and became a ratings hit. On the season finale (Wednesday night), the last two mismatched couples compete for the $250,000 prize. Presumably the geek will help the beauty count it.    TCM isn't particularly known as a science-fiction channel, but it's showing a mini-history of the genre, ''WATCH THE SKIES'' (Tuesday night). There are film clips of giant ants and attacking aliens as well as commentary from STEVEN SPIELBERG, GEORGE LUCAS and JAMES CAMERON. This may feel like a long promotion for the new ''War of the Worlds,'' but it's interesting to know that when Mr. Spielberg first saw ''Forbidden Planet,'' he loved Robby the Robot.   THE WEEK AHEAD: July 3 -- July 9","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2005","title":"July 5, 1954, was SAM PHILLIPS's lucky day. A 19-year-old named ELVIS PRESLEY walked into his Memphis storefront, Sun Records. On Wednesday (8 p.m.), the PBS documentary ''GOOD ROCKIN' TONIGHT: THE LEGACY OF SUN RECORDS'' takes a look at Phillips (1923-2003) and his ego and offers up some unbeatable musical performances, including PAUL McCARTNEY doing ''That's All Right'' with Elvis's old musicians, and RUFUS THOMAS singing ''Bearcat.''    Two years and two failed series after walking off ''The West Wing,'' ROB LOWE is still wandering aimlessly, trying to find a new prime-time home. On Sunday at 8 p.m. he wanders into ''BEACH GIRLS,'' which LIFETIME describes as a special five-week event. Mr. Lowe plays Jack Kilvert, a widowed lawyer with a teenage daughter (CHELSEA HOBBS) in a small beach town. JULIA ORMOND, who came painfully close to stardom a few years ago, plays a reclusive author, an old friend of Jack's dead wife.    ''PRIVATE SCREENINGS: LAUREN BACALL'' (Monday, 8 p.m., TCM) is not much more than Ms. Bacall, 80, sitting in a red leather armchair talking, but what's wrong with that? She chats with ROBERT OSBORNE about her adoring mother, about being Jewish, the first time HUMPHREY BOGART kissed her, RONALD REAGAN movies she turned down, working with MARILYN MONROE and finally making it to Broadway. The film clips, thank Heaven, are not the ones viewers have seen a hundred times before.    As if the world didn't have enough gritty law-enforcement series, TNT introduces ''WANTED'' on Sunday at 10 p.m., with GARY COLE as the requisite world-weary cop with a lined face and a less than idyllic personal life. The gimmick is that this particular team goes after the 100 most wanted criminals in Los Angeles. As the prospective love interest, RASHIDA JONES shows a limited range of facial expressions. In the first episode, it's a light scowl.   THE WEEK AHEAD: July 31-Aug. 6","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2005","title":"Haters of light summer television, your antidote has arrived. FX begins broadcasting ''OVER THERE'' this week (Wednesday at 10 p.m.), a scripted grunt's-eye-view of the current Iraq war from the executive producers STEVEN BOCHCO and CHRIS GEROLMO. True to FX's emerging take on contemporary life -- as shaped by its other original shows like ''The Shield,'' ''Nip/Tuck'' and ''Rescue Me'' -- the war scenes on ''Over There'' are bracing and harshly rendered.    Enough of that -- back to airy, late-July programming. Three reality shows make their debuts this week. One is ''R U THE GIRL'' (on UPN, Wednesday at 8 p.m.), in which the two remaining members of the group TLC, T-BOZ and CHILLI, search for a replacement for LISA LEFT EYE LOPES, who died in a car accident three years ago. ''SITUATION: COMEDY'' (on BRAVO, Tuesday at 8 p.m.) attempts a resurrection of a different sort: contestants vie to write a funny sitcom in defiance of the current thinking that there is no such thing. And in NBC'S ''LAW FIRM'' (Thursday at 9 p.m.), 12 lawyers compete for a $250,000 prize by trying real cases. The eight-episode series was created by DAVID E. KELLEY, who formerly condemned reality television.    ''LAGUNA BEACH,''  an unscripted look from MTV at rich teenagers from Orange County, Calif., begins its second season with an hourlong episode (Monday at 10 p.m.). When viewers last saw the sun-kissed crew from Laguna, two-thirds of the show's love triangle, STEPHEN and LC, moved to San Francisco to begin college, leaving the alpha female, KRISTIN,  to rule the school during her senior year. In this season premiere, Christmas break brings the antagonistic trio back together.    LOGO will show all 13 ''WONDER FALLS,'' an idiosyncratic series about a post-collegiate slacker, beginning on Thursday at 9 p.m.. Fox canceled the show after four episodes in 2004.

In the first episode of his new series, ''30 DAYS'' (FX, Wednesday at 10 p.m.), Mr. Spurlock and his fiancée, ALEX JAMIESON, take minimum-wage jobs for a month and try to live on what they make. After a 20-year career in quirky films, KYRA SEDGWICK gives a drama series a try. In ''THE CLOSER'' (TNT, 9 p.m., Monday), her character is a Southern police detective who has just relocated to Los Angeles to handle high-profile murder cases. She is not particularly loved by her colleagues (because she's obnoxious), but in the interrogation room she is unequaled.    ''THE DEAD ZONE'' (USA, 10 p.m., Sunday), which is only vaguely like the STEPHEN KING novel and film of the same title, returns for a fourth season. Its psychic hero, Johnny Smith (ANTHONY MICHAEL HALL), is still worried about Greg Stillson (SEAN PATRICK FLANERY), an evil politician. But proving his guilt in a single murder is pretty ordinary, compared with Johnny's original vision of Stillson, in which his future election to high office leads to nuclear holocaust.    PBS often manages to present reality shows that don't insult viewers' intelligence. ''OPERATUNITY'' (Check local listings, Monday) answers the unlikely question: What if ''American Idol'' moved to London and specialized in operatic talent? The English National Opera searches for two unknown singers to appear in its next production of ''Rigoletto'' and does not ask SIMON COWELL to help judge.

In ''I WANT TO BE A HILTON'' (Tuesday at 9 p.m.), 14 contestants compete for a $200,000 ''trust fund.'' KATHY HILTON, Paris and Nicky's mom, will winnow the eclectic group of aspirants by giving them etiquette-oriented tasks. Like dog grooming.    On ABC Family, ''WILDFIRE'' will have a two-hour series premiere (Monday at 8 p.m.). The show -- about a troubled 18-year-old (GENEVIEVE CORTESE) who gets a job working with horses -- is the channel's first foray into scripted television.    FX's ''RESCUE ME,'' starring DENIS LEARY as an unstable New York City firefighter, returns for a second season (Tuesday at 10 p.m.). By the end of Season 1, Mr. Leary's Tommy Gavin had alienated nearly everyone around him. Now he has to get his old job back and stop drinking.    On the topic of drinking, the 16th season of ''THE REAL WORLD'' kicks off this week (MTV, Tuesday at 10 p.m.). This edition of the reality perennial was filmed in Austin, Tex., a city with more than enough bars to fuel drama among the show's roommates. Always topical in its casting, this ''Real World'' counts a veteran of the war in Iraq among its house of seven strangers.    In reruns, BBC America is showing the first two ''PRIME SUSPECT'' mysteries on Monday nights (9 p.m.). In Part 1 of the 1991 series, Jane Tennison (HELEN MIRREN) investigates a confounding murder, getting little help from her male co-workers. Reaching into the more recent past is a repeat of the March ''SOUTH PARK'' parody of the Terri Schiavo case (Comedy Central, Sunday at 11 p.m.). In it, Cartman appears before the Supreme Court to get Kenny's feeding tube removed, as he wants to inherit Kenny's Sony PlayStation.

SEAN McGINLEY, his brother, made an effort to keep Mark's memory alive by reaching out to other men who had lost brothers that day. ''BROTHERS LOST: STORIES OF 9/11'' (CINEMAX, Monday night at 7), the documentary he made about his experiences, includes interviews with 31 men. But, as Sean McGinley says, ''it was almost like it all added up to one story.''    In the middle of a sea of documentaries and news specials about Sept. 11 comes BRIAN SLOAN's ''WTC VIEW,'' a quirky, low-budget film that has its broadcast premiere on Sunday (LOGO, 10 p.m.). MICHAEL URIE stars as the young gay man who, on Sept. 10, 2001, places an ad looking for a roommate for his apartment, which has a fabulous view of the twin towers. Unlike most mainstream films on the subject, this one concentrates not on the attack itself or the people who died. Instead it focuses on what average New Yorkers were thinking, talking about and absorbing in the days afterward. After the second tower collapsed, the lead character's best female friend kept her appointment at the hairdresser.    If you want to escape the 9/11 coverage, the best route may be to the past. TCM is showing classic episodes of ''THE DICK CAVETT SHOW.'' These are interviews with major stars, starting Thursday night at 8 with a 1971 show devoted entirely to WOODY ALLEN. Promoting his film ''Bananas,'' Mr. Allen was 35 at the time, 13 years into psychoanalysis (''I try not to give him any accurate information about myself'') and divorced from Louise Lasser (''I would marry again''). He plays the clarinet twice.

At 8 p.m. CINEMAX will present JOHN CANEMAKER's half-hour film ''THE MOON AND THE SON: AN IMAGINED CONVERSATION,'' which won the Academy Award for best animated short earlier this year. It's not so much a tribute to Mr. Canemaker's Italian-American father, who died in 1995, as it is a psychodrama, an effort to work out a troubled father-son relationship posthumously. The animated figures include Nazis, 1950's policemen, Mafiosi here and abroad and a few cute sheep. ELI WALLACH and JOHN TURTURRO do the voices.    NBC, wondering how it could imitate Fox's überhit series, ''American Idol,'' but change it just enough to give it another title, has come up with ''AMERICA'S GOT TALENT,'' which has its two-hour premiere on Wednesday night at 9. The difference is that aspiring dancers, comedians and other performers -- not just singers -- will compete. But where are they going with this casting? The host is REGIS PHILBIN. The judges are DAVID HASSELHOFF, the singer BRANDY and, presumably in the Simon Cowell role, PIERS MORGAN, a British newspaper editor and television host.    Sometimes the PBS series ''HISTORY DETECTIVES'' does rattle on a little too much about its subjects. Do we really need to know the entire history of the cowboy profession while experts track down the truth behind a Chisholm Trail historical marker in a small Texas town? But in general, these investigations are highly satisfying emotionally. The fourth-season premiere (Monday at 9 p.m.) also looks into the history of a Houdini poster (the owner ends up with a program from that particular show) and a 45-star American flag that may have draped the coffin of President William McKinley after his assassination in 1901. That search ends up at a grave, but not McKinley's.

Once you've seen Hamlet in a corporate boardroom, you've seen them all. But ''ShakespeaRe-Told,'' BBC America's series of four adaptations, has been winning positive reviews despite its hideous title. Last week the series turned Beatrice and Benedick of ''Much Ado About Nothing'' into rival television news co-anchors. And this week it sets ''MACBETH'' (Sunday at 7 p.m.) in an elegant British restaurant that has just been awarded three Michelin stars. Now that's power. Joe Macbeth (JAMES McAVOY), the gifted chef, and his wife, Ella (KEELEY HAWES), the gracious maître d', do all the work, but the owner, Duncan (VINCENT REGAN), gets all the glory. Therefore Duncan is not long for this world. This production makes it clear why reality series set in restaurant kitchens work so well. And not just because there are so many sharp knives around.    It's hard out there for a suburban marijuana dealer like Nancy Botwin. If the second-season premiere of ''WEEDS'' (Monday at 10 p.m. on Showtime) is any indication, it's going to get harder. Nancy (MARY-LOUISE PARKER), who is just trying to maintain her family's upper-middle-class life now that she's a widow, wakes up in the bed of the new guy in her life (MARTIN DONOVAN) and learns he's a D.E.A. agent. The episode also includes a car crash, a suspicious fire, a family member's decision to become a rabbi and Nancy's business associates' decision to branch out.    Oh, dear. It's another inspiring real-life tale of a noble teacher who gives all to salvage the self-esteem of disadvantaged children. But ''THE RON CLARK STORY'' (TNT, Sunday, 8 p.m.) has two things going for it: MATTHEW PERRY, who has transcended his lovable but lightweight ''Friends'' persona, and a more believable script than the usual television-movie treacle. Some of the time. THE WEEK AHEAD: Aug. 13 - 19","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2006","title":"You know those movies with the lonely man and the lonely woman who are destined to be together but never actually meet until the final scene? BBC AMERICA's new import with the unfortunate title ''LOVE SOUP'' will drag out the process for a whole season, maybe longer. TAMSIN GREIG plays Alice, a perfume saleswoman who worries that a real estate agent is using her apartment during the day. MICHAEL LANDES is Gil, an American television writer who agonizes during every taxi ride about the meter's final click, because he has the tip all figured out. (Hey, that's not so crazy.) Both Alice and Gil are very upset about the asteroid that is going to strike Earth. Strangely, nobody else is. TRUDIE STYLER tries something new, playing Gil's neighbor and confidante, who has just thrown out her cheating husband. And his elderly mother. The series premiere is Tuesday night at 10.    Gal-pal sitcoms come in many flavors, from the perky ''Mary Tyler Moore Show'' to the lusty ''Sex and the City.'' ''THE MINOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF JACKIE WOODMAN,'' which has its premiere on Friday night (IFC, 11 p.m.), looks more like ''Absolutely Fabulous,'' with its over-the-top heroines. LAURA KIGHTLINGER plays Jackie, a film-magazine writer, and NICHOLLE TOM is her sidekick, Tara, who has a lowly job at a production company. Their first outrageous adventure begins when SALLY KELLERMAN, appearing as herself, rear-ends Jackie's car, which leads to Tara's joining Ms. Kellerman's favorite cult.    Apparently IFC, the Independent Film Channel, takes its name very seriously these days. A second new series, ''THE BUSINESS'' (Friday at 11:30 p.m.) is about a sleazy movie producer (ROB DELEEUW) trying to break into the indie scene. His past films include ''Drunk Chicks IV,'' and he's the classy kind of guy who would send a woman a box of wine.

ABC's ''BROTHERS AND SISTERS,'' which has its premiere on Sunday at 10 p.m., has all sorts of movie- and television-star power, including SALLY FIELD, TOM SKERRITT and RACHEL GRIFFITHS (late, so to speak, of ''Six Feet Under''). It is much more exciting that JON ROBIN BAITZ, the wildly talented Off Broadway playwright, is a creator, along with KEN OLIN. This could mean some blend of ''The Substance of Fire'' and ''Thirtysomething.'' It's about an extended California family with its own business, struggles and political differences. Oh, and its series premiere follows the season premiere of ''Desperate Housewives.''    Sydney Pollack has never made a documentary before, so he didn't know any better than to make ''SKETCHES OF FRANK GEHRY'' filmic (Wednesday night on PBS, check local listings). ''Sketches,'' part of the ''American Masters'' series (it also had a theatrical release last spring), takes a close look at the work and working style of Mr. Gehry, the risk-taking Pritzker Prize-winning architect. At one point he looks at a desktop model and announces, ''That is so stupid looking that it's great.''    You can wait until the Sofia Coppola movie opens next month, with Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette. (The idea of Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI is almost irresistible.) Or you can opt for the portraits and dramatizations of documentary reality in David Grubin's ''MARIE ANTOINETTE'' on Monday night (PBS, check local listings). Much of the first hour is devoted to Louis XVI's severe sexual problems, discussed in almost shockingly graphic detail. But 10 minutes or so into the second hour French citizens are storming the Bastille, and the queen's story turns to more public politics.

For the first time on the original ''Law & Order'' (Friday, 10 p.m.), Lieutenant Van Buren and Assistant District Attorney McCoy both start a season with new minions -- Milena Govich as a freshly promoted detective with a lot to prove, Alana De La Garza as McCoy's sixth hottie subordinate -- and little breath is wasted mourning the characters they replace. Dennis Farina's Detective Joe Fontana gets one mention in passing, and Annie Parisse's poor A.D.A. Alex Borgia, stuffed into a trunk in last season's finale, doesn't even rate that. Over at ''Law & Order: Criminal Intent'' (Tuesday, 9 p.m.), Jamey Sheridan's James Deakins gets just as little respect: Eric Bogosian materializes as the new captain, makes a few snide remarks about the eccentric methods of Detective Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) and they're off to the races. But on ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' (Tuesday, 10 p.m.), where the character played by the recently pregnant Mariska Hargitay is only going away for five episodes, the producers are kinder: Detective Olivia Benson gets the central role in the season opener as well as a handy plot twist to explain her imminent absence.    Viewers saddened by the temporary separation of Benson and Christopher Meloni's Detective Stabler on ''S.V.U.'' can turn to PBS's ''MYSTERY'' (Sunday, check local listings), where the latest ''Inspector Lynley'' series is on view. In these well-made BBC thrillers, Nathaniel Parker, as the toffish Lynley, and Sharon Small, as his sergeant, are a sort of British Mulder and Scully, forever separated by class (or maybe not).

Last month NBC gave us Aaron Sorkin's ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,'' a behind-the-scenes drama series about a television show a lot like ''Saturday Night Live.'' Now the same network gives us ''30 ROCK'' (Wednesdays at 8 p.m.), a behind-the-scenes comedy series about a television show a lot like ''Saturday Night Live,'' starring and written by TINA FEY, formerly a real-life star and writer of ''Saturday Night Live.'' This feels a little like (but actually stranger than) the fall of 1994, when two hospital dramas, David E. Kelley's ''Chicago Hope'' and Michael Crichton's ''ER,'' had their premieres. In that case even the perceived loser (''Chicago Hope'') did well, running for six years and winning seven Emmys. This should make Ms. Fey and company feel a little less threatened by the glowing reviews for ''Studio 60.''    That new comedy will be followed by ''TWENTY GOOD YEARS'' (NBC, Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m.), which pairs JEFFREY TAMBOR and JOHN LITHGOW as middle-aged friends who take a joint carpe-diem pledge, realizing that they may have only a couple of decades left before death or assisted living gets them. This is a peculiar premise, since the conventional wisdom is that no network wants viewers over 50. Maybe Mr. Tambor's goofy persona from ''Arrested Development'' and ''The Larry Sanders Show'' and Mr. Lithgow's from ''3rd Rock From the Sun'' can be ridiculous enough to appeal to age-disdaining 20-year-olds.    The stars of the History Channel's ''ENGINEERING AN EMPIRE: EGYPT'' (Monday, 9 p.m.) are much older: well over 4,000, in the case of Old Kingdom pharaohs like Djoser and Snefru. This two-hour series premiere analyzes the less-than-breaking news that the ancient Egyptians really knew what they were doing in tomb and temple building, but the computer graphics are nice.

In ''BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN -- THE SEEGER SESSIONS LIVE,'' a ''Great Performances'' special on PBS stations Wednesday night (check local listings), Mr. Springsteen pays tribute to PETE SEEGER, 87, with a program of songs Mr. Seeger made popular, including ''John Henry,'' ''Jacob's Ladder'' and the civil rights anthem ''We Shall Overcome.'' It's basically an hourlong plug for his new album and tour, but we'll take Springsteen any way we can get him.    STEVE BRIDGES, the Bush impersonator, was a hit working side by side with the president at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner in April. He'll perform for the first family again on ABC's holiday gala ''AN AMERICAN CELEBRATION AT FORD'S THEATER: THE JULY 4TH SPECIAL'' (Tuesday night at 10). Heaven knows shows like these need laughs, so it's good to learn that in addition to the musical acts (including HEATHER HEADLEY and the country group LONESTAR), KEVIN NEALON will perform, and that TOM SELLECK, who can be funny under the right circumstances, is the host. NBC's special ''MACY'S 4TH OF JULY FIREWORKS SPECTACULAR'' is conveniently scheduled for 9 p.m., so viewers can watch both.    The new version of ''Doctor Who,'' the British adventure series about a time traveler who faces aliens and other annoyances, had its premiere on the Sci Fi Channel in March. And on Tuesday ''DOCTOR WHO -- THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON'' will be released on DVD.

SHOWTIME is surely thinking forward to life after ''The Sopranos,'' and as a replacement proposes ''BROTHERHOOD,'' which has its premiere Sunday night at 10. JASON CLARKE stars as the Providence politician and family man, trying to avoid the rampant corruption around him. JASON ISAACS is his gangster brother, who has just come back to town after years on the run. There are suitcases full of money, suspicious construction sites and casual violence (including a severed ear in the first hour).    The last few STEPHEN KING television projects haven't exactly been masterpieces. But the latest, ''NIGHTMARES & DREAMSCAPES: FROM THE STORIES OF STEPHEN KING,'' is at least highly ambitious. It's a four-week extravaganza of eight stories, beginning on Wednesday (TNT, 9 p.m.) with a commercial-free hour and a star turn by WILLIAM HURT. He plays a San Francisco hit man who kills a toy manufacturer, then finds himself under siege by an army of tiny plastic soldiers with surprisingly real weapons. That will be followed by CLAIRE FORLANI and EION BAILEY as newlyweds honeymooning in another dimension.    The first season of the Showtime series ''WEEDS'' comes out on DVD on Tuesday (Lionsgate, $39.98). MARY-LOUISE PARKER, who beat out the ''Desperate Housewives'' stars for a Golden Globe, plays a tasteful suburban widow, soccer mom and marijuana dealer. Hey, how else is she going to keep her fabulous house? ELIZABETH PERKINS is her best friend (in a way), the most deliciously detestable role of her career.    And now that Bruce Springsteen has gone folkie again, the latest ''AMERICAN MASTERS'' documentary, ''WOODY GUTHRIE: AIN'T GOT NO HOME'' (PBS, Wednesday, check local listings), seems timely.

In ''LADETTE TO LADY,'' imported by the SUNDANCE CHANNEL (Thursday, 9 p.m.), some tasteful teachers play Henry Higgins at tasteful Eggleston Hall. They take on 10 proud ladettes, who compete to be transformed into the sorts of girls PRINCE WILLIAM could bring home. The first step is putting them into sweater sets and pearls. Even viewers who think most reality series are drivel may find this one entertaining.    The British do that sort of thing so well. Then, sometimes, American television takes a British series and wrings the social anthropology out of it. Yes, the big one is back. ''SURVIVOR: PANAMA -- EXILE ISLAND'' has its season premiere Thursday night at 8 on CBS. A new batch of attractive people (including a retired astronaut, a performance artist and a social worker) compete for big money by being devious and manipulative.    There is plenty of worthy, culturally significant programming ahead for Black History Month, but one of the most intriguing specials comes from an unlikely source: TV LAND. WAYNE BRADY is a much better stand-up comedian than he is a talk-show host, but he doesn't need to be scintillating on ''THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,'' which begins on Wednesday (10 p.m.). His guests (HARRY BELAFONTE, DIAHANN CARROLL, PAUL MOONEY and TOURÉ on the first of the three one-hour segments) take the ball and run with it, with some promising straight talk about perceptions of race in popular culture.

The new four-hour television version (ABC, Monday and Tuesday nights at 9) stars DOUGRAY SCOTT as Moses, and he is a lot more conflicted than CHARLTON HESTON, who starred in the original, would have ever allowed himself to be. The parting of the Red Sea is considerably more impressive than in the 1956 version, but not quite as much as it should be. The Burning Bush is still a little unconvincing.    The pictures don't simply tell the story in ''HONEY, WE'RE KILLING THE KIDS'' (Monday at 9 p.m. on TLC). The pictures are the story. A concerned nutritionist makes her point about diet and exercise by showing parents before and computer-generated after photographs of their children: what they look like now and what they'll look like at 40 if they continue with their unhealthy high-fat diets and sedentary habits. The horrifying results get one family's attention, but their efforts to switch to healthful dishes like seafood paella seem to strike them all as a terrible punishment. ''Dinner was just disgusting,'' one of the sons says. The father adds, ''It don't have no taste.''    It's doubtful that anyone other than nature-show addicts will turn to ''THE QUEEN OF TREES'' (Sunday at 8 p.m. on Channel 13), a study of the symbiosis between the African sycamore fig and the tiny fig wasp. But the knockout cinematography, with its painterly colors and composition, makes this a sort of Merchant Ivory variation on the genre. So the special may appeal to people who would not otherwise be interested in seeing crocodiles fishing, bats urinating, butterflies getting drunk or giraffes chewing in close-up.

Ms. Proulx coined that bit of ''Winnie-the-Pooh''-inspired sass in an acidic rant in The Guardian after ''CRASH'' beat out her ''BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN'' for the best-picture Oscar. Showtime is offering the television premiere of ''Crash,'' the love-it-or-laugh-at-it examination of race relations in Los Angeles, this Sunday at 8 p.m., and to the delight of cheap heffalumps everywhere, the screening falls during a free preview weekend for the pay channel.    After ''Crash'' is the Season 2 premiere of ''HUFF'' (10 p.m.), the HANK AZARIA series that improved over the course of its first year. When we last saw Huff, a troubled psychiatrist, he had just walked in on a postcoital scene between his mother (BLYTHE DANNER) and his disastrously unhinged best friend (OLIVER PLATT).    In a February episode of ''THE DOG WHISPERER,'' CESAR MILLAN, the miracle-working puppy pacifier, took in three dogs rescued from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. All three had behavioral and health problems related to their ordeals, and Mr. Millan was determined to rehabilitate them. This week's sequel (National Geographic Channel, Friday at 8 p.m.) follows the dogs' progress three months later, and culminates with a sob-inducing reunion for one of them.    Sadly, there will never be an ANNE HECHE television moment as completely nutso as her interview with BARBARA WALTERS in 2001, during which Ms. Heche talked about her other personality -- one named CELESTIA, who spoke to God and was from another planet -- while hyping her memoir, ''Call Me Crazy.'' Those of us who follow Ms. Heche wherever she goes, yearning for a follow-up, will enjoy her turn as a femme fatale in ''FATAL DESIRE'' (Lifetime, Monday at 9 p.m.), a television movie that is exactly what you would imagine from the title.

So ''REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER'' can safely be expected to bring together an interesting mix of people for the fourth-season premiere on Friday (HBO, 11 p.m.). It's a live show, so the writers are still considering topics. Possibilities, says an executive producer, include ''eavesdropping, Abramoff, Alito and 'Brokeback Mountain.' '' The world needs Mr. Maher's views.    Those so-called party-planning experts on the cable channels will be put to shame by ''WINDSOR CASTLE: A ROYAL YEAR,'' a three-part documentary that begins Wednesday (8 p.m.) on PBS stations. Windsor is, they say, the oldest and largest occupied castle on the planet. William the Conqueror built the first part in the 1070's. And in the long shots, it makes Brideshead look like a guest house. Part 1 is all about a state dinner given there by QUEEN ELIZABETH II for President JACQUES CHIRAC of France. The dinner wines are Château Léoville Poyferré and a Chassagne-Montrachet. The after-dinner entertainment is a condensed version of ''LES MISÉRABLES,'' starring the West End cast. The episode spends a lot of time with the chef, the kitchen staff, the footmen and the people who measure the distance between place settings. Very ''UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS.''    But enough of this high-toned entertainment. The real news is that ''COMEDY CENTRAL ROAST OF PAMELA ANDERSON: UNCENSORED!'' is being released on DVD on Tuesday. Roasters range in style from ADAM CAROLLA to BEA ARTHUR. In addition to jokes about breast size, rampant promiscuity, venereal disease and the infamous sex tape (and those are the tasteful topics), the DVD offers bonus material with memorable sights like ANNA NICOLE SMITH fielding tough questions on the red carpet and COURTNEY LOVE being herself at rehearsal.

Last season, this excellent Canadian series dramatized an emotionally dysfunctional Shakespeare festival trying to fight corporate creeps who wanted to turn the town where the festival is held into ''Shakespeareville,'' and put on ''Mamma Mia'' productions on the main stage. Now, coming off a triumphant production of ''Hamlet,'' Geoffrey (PAUL GROSS), the company's mad director, has to find a worthy follow-up. ''Macbeth,'' anyone?    This week, viewers will be treated to the polar opposites of BBC AMERICA's taste spectrum. At one end, the high-minded movie ''FRIENDS AND CROCODILES'' (Saturday at 10 p.m.) looks at the business world from the early 1980's through the beginning of the millennium with the story of a Gatsby-like enigma (DAMIAN LEWIS) and his wide-eyed protégée (JODHI MAY), who becomes increasingly hardened to corruption and dot-com foolishness. The premiere of Season 3 of the beautifully trashy ''FOOTBALLERS' WIVES'' (Sunday at 10 p.m.) has no such pretensions. Revel in its soapy smut.    ''PROJECT JAY,'' which chronicles the doings of JAY McCARROLL, the winner of ''PROJECT RUNWAY,'' is surprisingly poignant. In the one-hour special (BRAVO, Wednesday at 10 p.m.), Mr. McCarroll battles financial problems, health woes and HEIDI KLUM (the host of ''Runway,'' who commissions him to design her Emmy dress and then reneges, humiliating him). And then there's the gifted, hyperactive designer's self-hatred. That, at least, Mr. McCarroll seems used to, at one point singing a tuneful improvisation after glimpsing himself in the mirror: ''Who lives in a blobular vessel?/ I do, I do.''    Kids and stoners, take note: there's a new ''SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS'' prime-time special (NICKELODEON, Monday at 8 p.m.). SPONGEBOB and PATRICK -- in a moment of utter nerdiness -- go to a medieval-theme restaurant and end up traveling back in time to the 13th century.

Erase that from your mind. This stylized BBC production was phenomenally popular during its fall run in Britain, but its sexed-up take on the Charles Dickens novel divided viewers. The six-part series is undeniably gorgeous, though, and GILLIAN ANDERSON's portrayal of the chilly, heartbroken Lady Dedlock -- her first television role since ''The X-Files'' -- is not to be missed.    LIFETIME has made a safe bet that there is a large intersection of people who are both JUDY DAVIS fans and true-crime rubberneckers who enjoyed the lurid exploits of SANTE and KENNETH KIMES, the mother-son murder team. ''A LITTLE THING CALLED MURDER'' (Monday at 9 p.m.) takes a parodic, nearly burlesque approach to Sante and Kenneth (played by JONATHAN JACKSON), the Oedipal pair who conned and killed their way through moneyed society. Ms. Davis's courtroom ravings give this flick camp classic potential.    The fourth season of ''DALLAS'' on DVD (Tuesday release, Warner Home Video, $39.98) is a blast. Episode 1 opens in the aftermath of the most famous cliffhanger in television history, as a gunshot-riddled J. R. (LARRY HAGMAN) is discovered in his office. The stories hold up well enough, but the more surprising part about watching the 1980-81 season is the timelessness of the character acting: 25 years later, BARBARA BEL GEDDES's courageous Miss Ellie and Mr. Hagman's cackling J. R. are still wonderful.    LISA LOEB, the singer famous for ''Stay'' from the ''Reality Bites'' soundtrack, is on a manhunt in ''No. 1 SINGLE'' (E!, Sunday at 10 p.m.). Ms. Loeb enlists friends' matchmaking help, and moves from Los Angeles to New York to increase her luck. The show is easy to watch, but voice-over mantras like ''I want babies, not maybes'' veer into the hellishly cloying.

One Thursday evening last June, the director WALTER BOBBIE rocked the critics with a benefit performance of RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN'S 1949 musical about love, bigotry and change. ''SOUTH PACIFIC IN CONCERT FROM CARNEGIE HALL'' (check local listings) captures it all, with REBA McENTIRE as a not-so-surprisingly perfect Nellie Forbush and the astounding BRIAN STOKES MITCHELL as the French planter with whom she falls in love one enchanted evening.    It's a notable week for PBS. ''MASTERPIECE THEATER,'' which has played around with THOMAS HARDY before (most recently with a striking ''Far From the Madding Crowd'' in 1998), brings one of Hardy's lesser-known 19th-century novels to life. ''UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE'' (check local listings) stars KEELEY HAWES as Fancy Day, a young schoolteacher who moves to a small village in Dorset and finds herself with three ardent suitors. The farmer (STEVE PEMBERTON) has money and the parson (BEN MILES) has worldliness and ambition, but Dick Dewy (JAMES MURRAY) has true love on his side.    BILLIE JEAN KING had a dazzling tennis career, including 20 Wimbledon titles, but she will always be remembered best for playing and trouncing BOBBY RIGGS on Sept. 20, 1973, in front of some 90 million television viewers. She was 29 and he was 55, but Riggs seemed to believe that being male gave him a natural edge that would transcend the age difference. The new HBO documentary ''BILLIE JEAN KING: PORTRAIT OF A PIONEER'' (Wednesday, 10 p.m.) covers it all, from Ms. King's California childhood as a firefighter's daughter through her emergence as a gay icon.

He was embarrassed about being a hick from an anti-intellectual background. A few historians believe he was gay. ''LINCOLN,'' a three-hour HISTORY CHANNEL documentary that begins Monday night at 8, looks more at ABRAHAM LINCOLN's psyche and personal relationships than at his political goals and achievements. Except that he was very depressed about the Civil War. The film goes the KEN BURNS documentary style one better by having the camera substitute for Lincoln's eyes, trying to show the places and events of his life very literally from his point of view. Authors who comment on the man and his life include GORE VIDAL, JOSHUA WOLF SHENK and JAN MORRIS.    If ''THE 63rd ANNUAL GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS'' are on Monday night (NBC at 8), then the show-business awards season is well underway. The increasingly crowded, annoyingly repetitive show-business awards season, that is. Still, with the greatest number of nominations going to ''BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN,'' ''DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES'' and GEORGE CLOONEY, it could be an enjoyably intense evening. ANTHONY HOPKINS receives the lifetime achievement award this year. And here's a first: Miss Golden Globe, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's anachronistic sort of Homecoming Queen concept, is going to the daughter of a former Miss Golden Globe. This year's title holder, whose actual duties beyond being young, pretty and the daughter of a star are minimal, is DAKOTA JOHNSON, 16, whose parents are DON JOHNSON and MELANIE GRIFFITH (whose mother is TIPPI HEDREN).    Even people who don't care for ''AMERICAN IDOL'' sometimes enjoy the season premiere (FOX, Tuesday and Wednesday nights at 8). That's when the show's colorful longtime judges (SIMON COWELL, RANDY JACKSON and PAULA ABDUL) audition so many truly bad singers, which is always entertaining in a cruel way.

No, really: what actually happened on the show over the past five seasons? The most confusing television series of our time returns from a hiatus on Wednesday (ABC, 8 p.m.), beginning a sprint to the story's conclusion in May. Viewers last saw the pregnant Sydney Bristow, played by the pregnant JENNIFER GARNER, on a ship in the middle of the ocean, having survived a torture session overseen by her mother (LENA OLIN). If you've lost track of which characters are good and which are bad, who is alive and who is dead, and what the Rambaldi prophecy is, join the crowd. But with a clear endpoint in sight, here's hoping for a lively and satisfying finish for ''Alias.''    Those of us who are fanatical pet people knew that the funniest thing about CHRISTOPHER GUEST's faux documentary ''BEST IN SHOW'' was its realism, not its exaggerations. Now an actual documentary, ''THE STANDARD OF PERFECTION: SHOW CATS'' (PBS, Wednesday at 8 p.m.), does for felines what ''Best in Show'' did for canines: that is, represent their owners as lovingly devoted, obsessive freaks.    Less lovable pageantry is on display in ''TIARA GIRLS'' (MTV, Wednesday at 10:30 p.m.). This documentary series delves into the subculture of beauty pageants -- and wow. In the first episode, JAIME, who wants to win Miss Florida Teen U.S.A., has the full support of her competitive parents. Meaning, her father tells her she's fat and wants to call her principal to exempt her from schoolwork.    ''MURDER PREVENTION UNIT,'' a jumpy-looking, well-acted six-part series (BBC America, Monday at 10 p.m.), dramatizes the politically controversial method of stopping crimes before they happen.

That same year he released the documentary ''DIRECTED BY JOHN FORD,'' about his idol, the director of ''Stagecoach,'' ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' ''The Searchers'' and a host of other classics. Now Mr. Bogdanovich has updated and reorganized that documentary, adding interviews with Clint Eastwood (who calls Ford ''the essence of classical American cinema''), Walter Hill (who compares him to Dickens), Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, among others. TCM will show the new version Tuesday night at 8. The chatty 1969 interviews with John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda are still there. And Orson Welles is still the narrator.    Whoever chose the interviews and performances that make up the three-disc ''BEST OF CARSON VOLUME 1'' had some strange ideas about what constitutes the best of JOHNNY CARSON's three decades as host of NBC's ''Tonight'' show. But the set, to be released on DVD on Tuesday, does include Ellen DeGeneres's first appearance on the show (including her classic ''phone call to God'' material), from 1986. The highlight has to be an out-of-control ''lost episode'' from 1969 in which Bob Hope and Dean Martin make surprise appearances, and a great deal of cigarette smoking, drinking and revelry ensues. ''CARSON COUNTRY,'' with numerous country-and-western stars as guests, is also being released on DVD.    Showtime is observing Veterans Day, Saturday, with an all-day marathon of war movies and, at 7:30 p.m., the documentary ''HOME FRONT.'' The movie, shown at the Tribeca Film Festival this year, is not overtly pro-war or antiwar.

Showtime's ''MASTERS OF HORROR'' begins its second season on Friday at 10 p.m. with ''THE DAMNED THING,'' starring SEAN PATRICK FLANERY and directed by TOBE HOOPER of ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' fame. The requisite dangling entrails and spewing blood are featured.    So take us away, please, to the genteel world of ''MASTERPIECE THEATER.'' ''TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH'' (beginning tonight at 9 on PBS), based on William Golding's sea trilogy, is described as a story involving ''excitement, chaos and random horror.'' This is, after all, from the same William Golding who wrote ''Lord of the Flies.'' The three-part production, the tale of an 18th-century ocean voyage from England to Australia, stars Jared Harris, Sam Neill and the imposingly named Benedict Cumberbatch.    The DVD release of ''BEWITCHED: THE COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON'' on Tuesday is sort of a Halloween event, too. Season 4 of the best sitcom in history about a mortal advertising executive married to a beautiful witch still had the first Darrin (Dick York). And the great Marion Lorne was still around as the ditsy Aunt Clara. Clara wasn't really up to the task of baby-sitting the family's newest witch, little Tabitha, but she never stopped trying.

This year's (Wednesday at 10 p.m. on ABC) is four days before the Academy Awards. And three of its four interview subjects have never even been nominated for an Oscar. MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY won a People's Choice Award this year as favorite male action star. PATRICK DEMPSEY, basking in his surprise stardom on ABC's ''GREY'S ANATOMY,'' was once nominated for an Emmy. MARIAH CAREY won the uncoveted Razzie as worst actress in her 2001 film ''GLITTER.'' So the theory must be that GEORGE CLOONEY, with three nominations (one for ''SYRIANA'' and two for ''GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK''), makes up for that.    They were going to call DICK WOLF's new series ''Young Prosecutors.'' The plan is to concentrate on the personal travails of the characters -- young assistant district attorneys in New York -- more than their professional lives, which goes against everything that his ''LAW & ORDER'' franchise stands for. But when the series has its premiere on Friday (NBC, 10 p.m.), it will be called ''CONVICTION.'' Alexandra Cabot (STEPHANIE MARCH) moves from ''LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT'' to play the new bureau chief. JORDAN BRIDGES and JULIANNE NICHOLSON are her underlings. In the pilot, a senior D.A. is gunned down.    After that lackluster performance at the Grammy Awards, a certain ex-Beatle needs a comeback. At least ''PAUL McCARTNEY: CHAOS AND CREATION AT ABBEY ROAD,'' a ''GREAT PERFORMANCES'' special (Monday at 10 p.m. on PBS), strives to be low key.

Monday's episode (Fox, 8 p.m.) will pick up that cliffhanger. In the coming episodes, Lincoln (DOMINIC PURCELL), Michael's brother, will be a dead man walking, though presumably without the dead-man part -- otherwise the show would end.    Last season on ''SOUTH PARK,'' MATT STONE and TREY PARKER, its creators, questioned the sexuality of TOM CRUISE, desecrated the VIRGIN MARY and eviscerated the Church of Scientology (which prompted ISAAC HAYES, the Scientologist who gave voice to Chef, to quit the show last week). The profane cartoon's 10th season begins this week (Comedy Central, Wednesday at 10 p.m.).    JONATHAN ANTIN, the hair stylist who is the subject of Bravo's reality series ''BLOW OUT,'' is a narcissist. His Los Angeles salons are named Jonathan, his hair product line is called Jonathan Product and if there were a drinking game for every time he breaks down in tears when talking about how far he has come in life, we would all be wasted. In other words, bring on Season 3 (Tuesday at 9 p.m.).    The third anniversary of the invasion of Iraq is Sunday. Sundance is screening movies related to the war, starting with the short documentary ''BIG STORM: THE LYNNDIE ENGLAND STORY'' (Sunday at 9 p.m.), in which TWAN HUYS, a Dutch filmmaker, examines Ms. England's role in the abuse at Abu Ghraib prison.

The show, which finishes big with the title song from ''CABARET,'' won four Emmys. BOB FOSSE's choreography didn't hurt.    HENRY ROLLINS of BLACK FLAG is pushing one thing above all about ''THE HENRY ROLLINS SHOW'' (IFC, Saturday at 10 p.m.). Nothing will be censored on this talk show, he says, and that goes for musical guests as well as interview subjects. In the premiere show, OLIVER STONE talks a little about his forthcoming movie ''WORLD TRADE CENTER'' and laments the current state of the United States, comparing the current president, vice president, secretary of state and secretary of defense to the GANG OF FOUR.

FRANKIE VALLI is tonight's returning guest star. BEN KINGSLEY will turn up later in the season. And this is not the end: eight more episodes are planned for 2007.    There is absolutely no such thing as a ''Seinfeld'' curse. The majority of all new series flop, so the failure of sitcoms with Michael Richards, Jason Alexander and JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS doesn't mean much. Still, the premiere of ''THE NEW ADVENTURES OF OLD CHRISTINE'' (Monday at 9:30 p.m. on CBS), starring Ms. Louis-Dreyfus, makes some of us nervous. She plays a divorced mom (as if her old character, Elaine, had a maternal bone in her body) and gym owner. The first episode is all about enrolling her 8-year-old son (TREVOR GAGNON) in a private school (''Where are the black people?'' he asks) and establishing her relationship with her ex-husband (CLARK GREGG), who has a new girlfriend (EMILY RUTHERFORD), also named Christine. Thus the title.    SEBASTIAN TELFAIR, a young basketball player from Coney Island, is such a star that on the first day of his senior year in high school he holds a press conference. And no one thinks that's unusual. The documentary ''THROUGH THE FIRE'' (Sunday night at 8 on ESPN), which has a lot in common with Steve James's ''Hoop Dreams'' (1994), sees him through graduation, his choice between going to college and a pro career, and the point of it all: getting himself and his family out of the projects.

For grown-ups it may be even better. This one-hour improv special was to be taped on Wednesday night at a comedy festival in Las Vegas, with BRIAN HENSON among the puppeteers. Past improv performances by this group have resulted in irreverent routines about a French-speaking koala who robs a sperm bank, a chimpanzee professor beating up a little girl because she is a suspected Communist, a group of hot dogs out roller-skating, and a Miss World contestant who makes omelets for visiting space aliens.    ''DESPERATE CROSSING: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE MAYFLOWER'' (History Channel, Sunday, 8 p.m.) goes all the way back to the Reformation to explain who the Pilgrims were and why they traveled to the New World in 1620. One way to look at this three-hour documentary (with dramatizations) is as a particularly thorough pre-Thanksgiving history lesson. Another is to view it as a much-needed examination of what founding a country on the principle of religious freedom (and the subsequent separation of church and state) was really about, and how it translates into political decision-making today.    This is what honesty in television titles has come to. ''MADONNA: THE CONFESSIONS TOUR -- LIVE FROM LONDON'' (NBC, Wednesday, 8 p.m.) is nowhere near live. It was taped at Wembley Arena in August. There will be songs from Madonna's most recent album, ''CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR,'' and there will be some of her greatest hits from years past.

It begins at 8 with ''RUDOLPH, THE RED-NOSED REINDEER,'' first shown in 1964 and narrated by Burl Ives. Four decades later it seems as if an elf who really wants to be a dentist has always been part of Rudolph's story. But the song's original plot is around, too: glowing-nosed outcast, ridiculed and banned from reindeer games, leads Santa's sleigh through a foggy Christmas Eve and saves the holiday.    ''FROSTY THE SNOWMAN'' (1969), narrated by the great Jimmy Durante, follows at 9, with its tale of a magic hat that brings a snowman to life and the little children who set out to save Frosty when he begins to melt. Unfortunately the original ''Frosty'' is only a half-hour long, so CBS has scheduled its highly inferior 1992 sequel, ''FROSTY RETURNS,'' at 9:30. Could be a good time to walk the dog.    And now for something completely unholidaylike: PATRICK STEWART, lauded interpreter of Shakespeare, Dickens and ''Star Trek,'' stars in a new offering from BBC America. In ''THE ELEVENTH HOUR,'' a four-hour, four-part series beginning Monday at 9 p.m., he plays Ian Hood, a government science adviser (and former physics professor) whose raison d'être is preventing mad, evil or simply misguided scientists from misusing technology. Hood's hobby appears to be making his bodyguard (Ashley Jensen) crazy. In the first episode he goes after a mastermind nicknamed Geppetto, who is heading an ambitious human cloning project.

After that are two new series: ''LUCKY LOUIE'' (10:30 p.m.), a sitcom with LOUIS C. K., and ''DANE COOK'S TOURGASM,'' an unscripted show that follows the stand-up comedian on the road.    Two summer hits from basic cable also return this week. On the third season of ''THE 4400'' (USA, Sunday at 9 p.m.), the series resumes in its ''X-Files''-ish/''X-Men''-like way, as the returned abductees unleash their powers on the rest of the world. And on ''THE CLOSER'' (TNT, Monday at 9 p.m.), KYRA SEDGWICK's detective character continues to use her Southern noncharm to bug Los Angeles criminals into confessing.    The dam breaks on the deluge of summer reality programming this week. ABC offers the frothy ''HOW TO GET THE GUY'' (Monday at 10 p.m.), in which four San Francisco women (the Party Girl, the Girl Next Door and so on) are coached in the ways of dating. The two coaches are engaging and practical -- they advise not getting wasted on dates -- and the women are likable (except for the New Age irritant known as the Dreamer).    CBS's newest unscripted entry is ''THE TUESDAY NIGHT BOOK CLUB'' (Tuesday at 10 p.m.), which tries to be a real-life ''Desperate Housewives.'' And ''HELL'S KITCHEN,'' a success for FOX last summer, returns on Monday at 9 p.m. Chefs will try to avoid the wrath of their teacher, the screaming rage-aholic GORDON RAMSAY, and win a cooking competition. THE WEEK AHEAD: June 11 - June 17","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2006","title":"In ''ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: LIFE THROUGH A LENS,'' which has its premiere on ''American Masters'' on Wednesday (PBS, check local listings), Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, calls Ms. Leibovitz ''Barbra Streisand with a camera.'' But this documentary was written and directed by BARBARA LEIBOVITZ, the subject's sister, so the superstar photographer Annie Leibovitz comes off as anything but difficult. The film traces her career from her Rolling Stone cover days and visits a few remarkably elaborate Vanity Fair photo shoots. Lots of famous people (YOKO ONO, MICK JAGGER and HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON among them) praise her abilities.    Speaking of Sir Mick, the ABC sitcom ''THE KNIGHTS OF PROSPERITY,'' which begins Wednesday night at 9, was going to be called ''Robbing Mick Jagger.'' In it a group of blue-collar losers (led by DONAL LOGUE) decide to make their financial dreams come true by breaking into Mr. Jagger's lavish Central Park West apartment. (It has an indoor pool, a ''hat room'' and a dining room big enough for a soccer match.) The challenge will be to stretch that premise into a television season, even a short one. But the writers do manage to devote the entire first episode to the group's efforts to find out their target's apartment number.    COURTENEY COX returns to series television on Tuesday night in ''DIRT'' (FX, 10 p.m.), a soapy drama about the beautiful, ruthless editor of a celebrity magazine. The stories are about sex, drugs, ambition and betrayal. The danger is that the show might be as glib, mean-spirited and self-satisfied as the magazine. At least nobody can accuse it of being a ''Friends'' spinoff. Ms. Cox's character is more like the single-minded television reporter she played in the ''Scream'' movies than the lovably vulnerable Monica Geller.   THE WEEK AHEAD: Dec. 31 - Jan. 6","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2006","title":"''THE O.C.'' may have sunk to the lower depths of the prime-time ratings, but presumably it will stay on the air at least until Thursday at 9 p.m. so that this season's Chrismukkah episode won't go to waste. This time the hybrid holiday is merely a backdrop as the writers, perhaps feeling there are no sharks left to jump, conk George Bailey -- excuse me, Ryan -- on the head and let him see what Newport would have been like without him schlumping around and getting into fights for the last three years. The thing about this show is that it's still got a mostly wonderful cast, and in this episode the actors actually look as if they're having fun.    Fun isn't always what Hunter S. Thompson appears to be having in the photos and snippets of interviews in ''BUY THE TICKET, TAKE THE RIDE: HUNTER S. THOMPSON ON FILM'' (Starz, 10 p.m. Tuesday). He's just as often amused, resigned or ironic about the paths the nation, and his life and reputation, are following. The documentary is a deluxe talking-head embalming: people from Bill Murray and Johnny Depp, who played Thompson on screen, to William F. Buckley, Tom Wolfe and the sheriff of Pitkin County, Colo., weigh in on what an inspiration and boon companion he was. But a sense of the man's honesty and anger leaks through. And it's worth it just to hear George McGovern, telling a Thompson-and-a-waitress story, say: ''I want six beers and four margaritas. You speak English?''    To see how a bit of Thompson's anarchic spirit could, once upon a time, make its way into the mass culture, get your hands on ''SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON, 1975-1976'' (Universal, $69.98). And to see the sort of thing that would have driven him out of the house, gun in hand, to take a few potshots at golf balls or hallucinatory birds, check out ''GEORGE CLOONEY: AN AMERICAN CINEMATHEQUE TRIBUTE'' (AMC, 8 p.m. Wednesday). Those of us with lower standards will find quite a few of the jokes funny and marvel once again at Mr. Clooney's charm. If there's an award out there for aw-shucks-you-don't-mean-me performance -- People's Choice or MTV must include that, right? -- he's a shoo-in. THE WEEK AHEAD: Dec. 10-16","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2006","title":"It just wouldn't be the holiday season without a television movie about someone who discovers the true meaning of love and family at Christmastime. This week's prime example, ''A PERFECT DAY'' (Monday, 8 p.m., TNT), stars ROB LOWE as an author who gets all carried away with himself when his first novel is a megasuccess. PAGET BREWSTER (she was Hank Azaria's wife on ''Huff'') plays his flawlessly supportive, long-suffering wife. FRANCES CONROY (from ''Six Feet Under'') is the flawlessly supportive agent whom most writers would kill to have. Needless to say, the denouement takes place in a churchyard as a light snow falls.    Over on CBS, the focus is on real-life happy endings. On the eighth annual special ''A HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS'' (Friday at 8 p.m.), this one with Rod Stewart's name appended to the title as host, a batch of celebrities (among them VIRGINIA MADSEN and CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER) talk about the joys of foster care and adoption. Real families make appearances to share their happy situations. Mr. Stewart, JOHN LEGEND, KATHARINE McPHEE and other musicians perform.    ''IDENTITY,'' NBC's new prime-time game show, could be much worse. At least when contestants face a dozen total strangers on this series, they're trying to guess more than how much money is in their briefcases. They're trying to match the 12 people with 12 traits (occupation, I.Q., sleeping habits, net worth and the like), and each right answer is one step closer to the $500,000 grand prize. Contestants will be called on to use perception and judgment. What a concept -- and shades of ''To Tell the Truth,'' back in the golden age of game shows! The network is showing ''Identity'' five nights in a row, beginning on Monday at 9. The celebrity host is PENN JILLETTE of the comedy-magic team Penn and Teller. (Yes, Mr. Jillette is the one who talks.)   THE WEEK AHEAD: Dec. 17 - 23","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2006","title":"This season the very idea of repeats seemed more infuriating than ever, perhaps because viewers have grown used to uninterrupted runs of reality series like ''AMERICAN IDOL'' and the unbroken sprints of ''NIP/TUCK,'' ''THE SOPRANOS'' and other scripted offerings. Now the networks' May finales have arrived in one large heap: the density is almost insulting after such long patches of tiresome reruns.    But we must persevere. So among the season finales this week are two of the ''CSI'' franchises (''NEW YORK,'' CBS, Wednesday at 10 p.m., and the Las Vegas flagship, Thursday at 9 p.m.). All three ''LAW & ORDER'' shows also conclude: On ''SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT'' (NBC, Tuesday at 10 p.m.) a famous man's condemnation of prescription drugs will lead a young fan (BRITTANY SNOW) to jettison her meds and go loony. And on the ''Law & Order'' mother ship (Wednesday at 10 p.m.) the audience will see why one of the main characters will not be returning next season.    This year ''GREY'S ANATOMY'' inherited the space in the popular consciousness formerly occupied by ''FRIENDS.'' On Sunday (ABC, 10 p.m.) and Monday (9 p.m. to 11) that hospital soap opera will conclude its second season: the search for a new heart for Denny (JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN) will become critical, and surgeons with awkward relationships -- which is everyone -- will be forced to work closely together.    Meanwhile a slew of veteran series will adjourn forever this week. ''THAT 70'S SHOW'' (Fox, Thursday at 8 p.m.) will finally ring in 1980, after eight seasons, and in a cloud of pot smoke. ASHTON KUTCHER -- and a second fan favorite -- will rejoin the festivities. ''THE WEST WING'' will also end its acclaimed run (Sunday at 8 p.m.) with the inauguration of Matt Santos (JIMMY SMITS) and the retirement of Jed Bartlet (MARTIN SHEEN). THE WEEK AHEAD: May 14 - May 20","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2006","title":"Any appearance by DIANE KEATON, Oscar winner and baby-boomer role model, is an event. Of course, Ms. Keaton has done her share of forgettable television movies, but the source material for ''SURRENDER DOROTHY'' (CBS, tonight at 9), MEG WOLITZER's 1999 novel, is promising. Ms. Keaton plays a grieving mother whose only child, Sara (ALEXA DAVALOS), has been killed in a car accident. She turns to Sara's friends, moving in with them at their summer house and becoming especially close to a young gay playwright (TOM EVERETT SCOTT). The theme -- at least in the book -- is family and friends' competing claims on the dead.    It's far from a guarantee of success, but the creators of the new NBC series ''FOUR KINGS'' (which has its premiere Thursday at 8:30 p.m.) are DAVID KOHAN and MAX MUTCHNICK, who gave the world the over-the-top, largely lovable characters of ''WILL & GRACE.'' At this point, however, the only clear similarities between the two shows are that they're both set in New York and have four main characters. Josh Cooke plays Ben, a young man with three close male friends ) and a grandmother who has died and left him her amazing Manhattan apartment. This being television, Ben doesn't move in alone or with his girlfriend (Kiele Sanchez). He invites his three guy pals to share the place. At least they have an excuse for living in an apartment so far beyond their means.    Inexpensive, often mindless reality series continue to infest prime time, but once in a while the premise is intriguing. MTV's ''X EFFECT,'' which has its premiere on Tuesday night at 10, could be interesting. The show reunites former couples, then watches what happens. This is an emotional dynamic that hasn't been used to death in nonfiction television, unless you count GEORGE and ALANA HAMILTON's talk show.   THE WEEK AHEAD: Jan. 1 - Jan. 7","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2006","title":"In the past year, the scruffily charming JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN has played a dead husband on ''WEEDS,'' a dying heartthrob on ''GREY'S ANATOMY'' and a missing father on ''SUPERNATURAL.'' Of those fitful jobs, ''Supernatural'' -- the WB's heebie-jeebies horror series -- has emerged as Mr. Morgan's best chance at a steady gig. His character has reappeared to help his sons (JARED PADALECKI and JENSEN ACKLES) find the demon that killed their mother. And in the season finale (Thursday at 9 p.m.), they will try to send it back to hell, or whatever one does with demons these days.    ''NASHVILLE STAR'' has less than 10 percent of the audience of ''AMERICAN IDOL,'' but it can be just as entertaining. This season, its fourth, the country music talent competition has showcased the viperlike judge ANASTASIA BROWN, the loopy WYNONNA JUDD as a host and a bunch of male contestants who look exactly alike. The finale is Tuesday (USA Network, 10 p.m.).    Sitcoms rarely age well, and topical ones tend to deteriorate dramatically. In November 1984, TV Guide described ''KATE & ALLIE,'' in which JANE CURTIN and SUSAN SAINT JAMES played divorced best friends who share a New York apartment with their kids, as ''a rare look at friendship between women.'' Female bonding is now a television staple, but luckily the clever ''Kate & Allie'' offers more than a dated view of friendship and divorce. The DVD of its six-episode first season (Tuesday release, Universal Studios, $29.98) is an unexpected delight.    Also on DVD is the gorgeous ''LIFE IN THE UNDERGROWTH'' (Tuesday release, BBC Video, $34.98), DAVID ATTENBOROUGH's latest exploration into the natural world. Using newfangled camera technology, Sir David illuminates the dramatic doings of invertebrates, like the bat-killing ways of centipedes and the mating rituals of hermaphroditic slugs. Animal Planet will also broadcast the program (Part 1, Sunday at 8 p.m.). THE WEEK AHEAD: April 30 - May 6","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2006","title":"PBS is bringing back ''GEORGE GERSHWIN: REMEMBERED'' (check local listings), a satisfying 1987 ''AMERICAN MASTERS'' documentary. In many ways the life of the man who composed ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' ''Porgy and Bess'' and a string of pop hits like ''The Man I Love'' is a classic New York story: growing up poor with immigrant parents, making it big on Tin Pan Alley, going Hollywood, becoming disillusioned, dying young.    The nice thing about ''THE 2006 ALMA AWARDS'' (Monday at 9:30 p.m. on ABC), which honors Latino performers, is that the nominees aren't all the same as those on the other thousand awards telecasts. CLIFTON COLLINS JR. (né Gonzalez-Gonzalez), for instance, is nominated for the film ''Capote'' (he played the killer Perry Smith). And who knew ALEXIS BLEDEL of ''Gilmore Girls'' was Hispanic (Mexican mother, Argentine father)? EVA LONGORIA of ''Desperate Housewives'' is host.    Nothing could sound like a worse programming idea than ''QUEER EYE: LAS VEGAS.'' But in this new batch of episodes, starting this week (Tuesday at 10 p.m. on BRAVO), the Fab Five demonstrate the proper mix of enthusiasm and superiority toward the city's excess. CARSON KRESSLEY wears gold lamé. JAI RODRIGUEZ tries on a showgirl outfit. And the whole gang piles into a white stretch limo to make over some poor heterosexual wretch, in this case a comedian-magician who lives with his artist wife in a house that Mr. Kressley describes as '' 'Golden Girls' on a budget.''    The comedian Kathy Griffin's self-deprecating act is getting a little old, but she does put her heart into it. The most painful moment on the season premiere of ''KATHY GRIFFIN: MY LIFE ON THE D-LIST'' (Tuesday at 9 p.m. on BRAVO) is Kathy Griffin Day in Louisville, Ky. The ceremony is sparsely attended, to say the least. Sometimes this hour feels like HBO's recent series ''The Comeback,'' about a washed-up television actress (played by Lisa Kudrow), which people either loved or hated.   THE WEEK AHEAD: June 4 - June 10","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2006","title":"Sweeps month rolls on. NBC's ''10.5: APOCALYPSE'' (Sunday and Tuesday nights at 9) is a sequel to a 2004 disaster film in which the West Coast was devastated by an earthquake that surely qualified as ''the big one.'' But my oh my, now there's an even worse earthquake coming. One seismologist (FRANK LANGELLA) has predicted that it could create a continental divide right down the middle of the United States. BEAU BRIDGES is the president, KIM DELANEY a determined seismologist, DAVID CUBITT her ex-boyfriend and GARCELLE BEAUVAIS-NILON the FEMA boss.    When Stephen King thinks about the apocalypse, he heads for Nevada (at least Las Vegas was the Antichrist's headquarters in ''The Stand''). The title of ''STEPHEN KING'S DESPERATION'' (ABC, Tuesday night at 8), a three-hour movie, refers to Desperation, Nev., where hapless motorists are stopped by a local lawman (RON PERLMAN), framed for marijuana possession and thrown in jail. The scary part is that dead people are lying all over town, and the cop is possessed by something evil. TOM SKERRITT, ANNABETH GISH, MATT FREWER and CHARLES DURNING are among the inmates. It's highly self-referential. (Yes, that's ''redrum'' written on a wall.)    One more time, it's the ''AMERICAN IDOL'' season finale on Fox. CHRIS DAUGHTRY, who even the notoriously demanding SIMON COWELL predicted would win, is gone. On Tuesday night at 8 the two finalists perform. Then the producers stretch out Wednesday night's show (also at 8), when the winner is announced, to two hours. That includes a reunion of the Top 12, but some people will still watch only the last 10 minutes.    For those not swept up so much by sweeps, ''JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER'' comes out as a two-disc DVD set (Sony Pictures, $19.94) on Tuesday. That means nine fairy tales (including one that asks whether a king will marry his beautiful daughter off to a hedgehog) and four Greek myths with decidedly uncuddly puppets. THE WEEK AHEAD: May 21-27","excerpt":"TELEVISION"},{"year":"2006","title":"''RESCUE ME'' returns this week (FX, Tuesday at 10 p.m.), and viewers who thought that the Season 2 death of Tommy's young son might sink the show into a maudlin morass will be pleased that Tommy (played by DENIS LEARY) is showing surprising resilience. Of course what passes for resilience on ''Rescue Me,'' the firefighter drama, is a character who still drinks and talks to ghosts, and who remains angry to the point of near violence, but at least he's making jokes. SUSAN SARANDON will guest star as a love interest for Franco (DANIEL SUNJATA) beginning in the second episode.    Nerds in prime time! ABC will broadcast ''THE 2006 SCRIPPS NATIONAL SPELLING BEE'' for the first time (Thursday at 8 p.m.). The preliminary rounds will be on ESPN earlier in the day (noon to 3 p.m.) so you can figure out your rooting interest.    Elsewhere in nerd news, NBC's reality franchise ''LAST COMIC STANDING'' has made its way back onto the schedule (Tuesday at 8 p.m.) after flaming out in an ill-conceived, hurried third season in the summer of 2004. JAY MOHR, the irascible former host, has been replaced by ANTHONY CLARK of ''Yes, Dear'' infamy. Can the once breezily enjoyable comedy competition overcome these obstacles?    Members of the ''LAGUNA BEACH'' cult who have wished that every reality series could be stuffed with compelling characters, gorgeously filmed and hypnotically paced can look forward to ''THE HILLS'' (MTV, Wednesday at 10 p.m.). This ''Laguna Beach'' spinoff follows the guileless, possibly simple-minded LAUREN CONRAD, late of Orange County, in her move to Los Angeles, where she gets an internship at Teen Vogue and enrolls in fashion school. From what viewers know of her already, Ms. Conrad seems destined to be surrounded by backstabbers and game players, and escaping Laguna has not changed her fate. Bad news for her, great news for us.

Maybe it has something to do with Bill Clinton and his saxophone. Certainly the Marsalis brothers, especially Wynton and Branford, figure prominently in the renaissance.

Politicians gravely declare themselves against it","excerpt":"television commentators toss the phrase about as if its meaning were transparent; and in this moment of spiritless conservatism there seems to be general agreement that the Republic will be endangered if ''special interests'' aren't curbed.   Lately, the phrase has been put to a     special use. It has become a code word for attacking unions, often by political figures intent upon picking up conservative votes within or near the more-or-less liberal arena of the Democratic Party.  When not sheer demagogy, the talk about ''special interests'' is mostly nonsense. It is also, for a while, politically effective. It conveys the impression of something small-minded, narrow-spirited - say, little groups trying to cover up pollution, or find dubious tax shelters, or keep children from getting needed medicines. But when the term is applied to unions, whose members and families may total 40 million people, then one can detect a malicious intent. For the organized workers of America constitute a large segment of the American people. They are not something apart or ''special'': They are integral to our life.  Hundreds of thousands of these people have suffered badly during the recent recession, and for workers in Detroit, Youngstown and Gary, Ind., that recession is by no means over. Their unions have come under sharper attack than at any time since the late 1920's. If the organized American workers do form a ''special interest,'' it is largely in the sense that they have taken a special beating during the Reagan years.

What seemed a political farce, though, hinted at a deeper shift in Bonn's approach to Eastern Europe.     The imbroglio arose from Mr. Kohl's surprising decision to address a June gathering of an organization of Germans who at the end of World War II fled Silesia, which now lies in Poland. When the German Silesians came up with the motto ''Forty years of banishment - Silesia remains ours,'' the Chancellor got cold feet, fearing that his appearance under such a banner would lend credence to Moscow's strident campaign charging Bonn with irredentist ambitions to restore Germany's 1937 boundaries (which included parts of present-day Poland but not Austria or Czechoslovakia).

Just as TV Guide is one of the United States' top-selling magazines, France's three top-selling magazines are voted to television.          The local movie industry has particular cause for complaint because, while the French still love films, they increasingly watch them on television.

The 10th anniversary of the fall of Saigon was big; the Geneva summit was bigger; the hostage crisis was biggest of all. Was the world a huge sound stage? Television, increasingly supranational, leaped whole continents at a single bound. Where this will end nobody knows, and one missed the Presidential campaign of 1984. We knew where we were then, and so did anchormen and correspondents. The ground rules were firm. In 1985, Nabih Berri metamorphosed into Raisa Gorbachev and somehow they both visited Bitburg. Only occasionally did a journalist restore order.  Thus, while correspondents roamed all over Vietnam last spring, pondering, explaining and trying to come to grips, the clearest picture of what Vietnam meant was presented by Marvin Kalb, who stayed home. Mr. Kalb and his colleagues gave us ''Vietnam: Lessons of a Lost War,'' an NBC ''White Paper.'' Coincidentally, they also gave all three networks a splendid argument for why they should retain documentaries if they are serious about news and public affairs.
