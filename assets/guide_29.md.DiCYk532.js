These days, Mr. Paik's focus has shifted from performance art to multi-screen television installations and global satellite productions. Nonetheless his Dadaist impulses persist, often taking the form of more subtle acts of esthetic subversion, like using magnets to destroy the normal functions of a bank of television monitors, or staging events like \\"The First Accident of the 21st Century,\\" a choreographed collision between a robot and an automobile driven by a friend. NAM JUNE PAIK: Video Time -- Video Space (Abrams, $49.50) is a lavishly illustrated, highly eclectic survey of the artist's career, from his early Fluxus days in Germany to his experiments with video technology and room-sized video environments in the 1970's and 80's. Rather than presenting Mr. Paik's career chronologically, the editors -- Toni Stooss, director of the Kunsthalle Vienna, and Thomas Kellein, director of the Kunsthalle Basel -- have mixed previously published articles by critics and museum curators with new writings and reminiscences by friends, fellow artists and Mr. Paik himself. The results are uneven, though there are memorable surprises, including a sly interview with John Cage, whose music was a major influence on Mr. Paik, and an evocative essay by the feminist writer Kate Millett recalling the near-utopian idealism of the New York art scene in the early 1960's. Other contributors include the architect Arata Isozaki and the poet Allen Ginsberg. This is a provocative book that chronicles not only Mr. Paik's career but also 30 years of changes in the international art world.\\nANDREA BARNET IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"Captain Video"},{"year":"1932","title":"ITHACA, N.Y., Sept. 24. -- Cornell's football team, led by Captain Bart Viviano, who scored three touchdowns and place-kicked a point after touchdown, overwhelmed the University of Buffalo on Schoellkopf Field today, 72 to 0.
