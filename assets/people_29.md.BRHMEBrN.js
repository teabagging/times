But the answer is not so optimistic as it was a few years ago, she said, because what used to be a growth area for jobs has probably reached maturity.    In every fast-growing field, the job mix changes as time goes by, and that is happening now in computer science. At present there appears to be a slightly increasing need for telecommunications specialists and computer repair personnel, but demand has lessened for other types of computer specialists, including most types of programmers.

In fact, the farmer might have a small hand calculator stuffed in a pocket instead of the usual notebook and pencil. After all, the average price of farmland now is $2,000 or so an acre, meaning that a 500-acre Indiana farm growing soybeans or corn is big business.   In the farmhouse, the chances are, a prosperous farmer might have a small desk-sized computer terminal where he can store information pertinent to previous years' crop results - seed, fertilizer, number of acres planted to various crops, weather impact, the amount of fuel used in tractors. Through a telephone call or a trip to the county extension office, programmed information from Purdue University's computer, based on the farmer's individual data, is available.

But reductions in the size of computer keyboards have been somewhat limited, simply because a person's hands and fingers cannot shrink along with the keys.   In an attempt to push beyond those boundaries, two brothers in Salt Lake City have patented a keyboard that expands and contracts like an accordion. The keyboard uses overlapping keys mounted on an expandable framework. The top of each key is at a slight angle, so that each one can slide beneath a portion of the one next to it when the device is being stored. The keys themselves are mounted on a collapsible latticework that stretches and collapses like the gates sometimes used to keep small children away from stairs.   William H. Roylance and Byron D.

Fuzzy logic is a programming method that allows computers to deal with uncertainties or information that is considered partly true. All modern elevator banks are run by complex computer programs that deploy cars with pre-programmed standards -- sending a car to a floor because it is closest, can get there fastest or is already on its way toward that stop.

These traditional bars are the best places to ingest coffee in the city, but they are also great places to pop in for a quick lunch or preshow aperitivo. Here, the coffee is as smooth as silk, and a glass of spumante costs less than a Coca-Cola.  Etiquette Please, no cappuccinos after noon. It’s strictly a breakfast drink. If you take your coffee and brioche standing at the bar, get your receipt first. It will cost you a 1/4 of the table service prices. It’s perfectly acceptable to ask for your coffee da portare via, or “to go.” The barmen will enjoy the novelty.  From 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., stop by for an aperitivo and you’ll be showered in decadent, free food with your drink. Skim milk is for sadists. Canines welcome at all times","excerpt":"computers, less so.

(James H. Silberman/Harvest/Harcourt, $16.) The author's account of the nation's bubble years, which has been updated with a new afterword, illuminates the booming, self-indulgent 1990's by focusing on characters who seemed to embody the age -- including the casts of the O. J. Simpson trial and the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal -- and puncturing some of the reigning myths of the times. The result is ''an earnest, angry, poignant, foreboding book,'' Robin Toner wrote in the Book Review in 2001.    THE SAVAGE GIRL, by Alex Shakar. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) This vaguely futuristic first novel features a heroine who works for a trend-spotting visionary with an uncanny knack for tracking the zeitgeist. Among his brainstorms: savage chic and diet water. ''It's exciting to meet a new novelist who's not afraid of heights,'' Jeff Giles said here last year. '' 'The Savage Girl' is a wild, ambitious, at times crazily overwrought dystopian'' tale.    A SMALL TREATISE ON THE GREAT VIRTUES: The Uses of Philosophy in Everyday Life, by Andr&#233","excerpt":"Comte-Sponville. (Metropolitan/Owl/Holt, $16.) A French philosopher draws on 2,500 years of traditional wisdom to compile a list of 18 essential virtues, encompassing the Platonic (justice, courage, prudence and temperance) and ideals like politeness, fidelity and even humor. ''This is no ordinary work of philosophy,'' Anthony Gottlieb wrote here in 2001. ''In addition to its directness and clarity . . . it is pretty much aimed at moral improvement rather than textual interpretation.''    SAMUEL JOHNSON IS INDIGNANT: Stories, by Lydia Davis. (Picador USA, $13.) Part put-on, part confession and part aesthetic treatise on the nature of fiction and the corrective self-editing of memories, these brief stories apply a rigorous mock logic to the mental stuff of everyday life -- our perceptions, rationalizations and modes of communication. ''With her deadpan delivery and shaggy-dog profundities, Davis might be thought of as an erudite stand-up comedian, one who works philosophers' conferences instead of nightclubs,'' Albert Mobilio wrote here in 2001.    THE LAST CANYON, by John Vernon. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) Two intertwined stories unfold in this fact-based novel: that of John Wesley Powell's harrowing 1869 expedition in four frail boats through the Grand Canyon, and that of a band of Paiute Indians searching the region for a missing child. ''Vernon has written . . . a novel that borrows the exactitude of history, that lets us trust the country in which he sets us down, seeing as if with Paiute eyes or mapping, like Powell, with sextant in hand,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg said here last year. Down the Great Unknown: John Wesley Powell's 1869 Journey of Discovery and Tragedy Through the Grand Canyon, by Edward Dolnick (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95), tells of how Powell, a one-armed Civil War veteran, and his raw crew of nine endured their 99-day voyage to map the Green and Colorado Rivers. ''Dolnick makes effective use of Powell's beautifully written journals,'' Diana Silver wrote here earlier this year.    FIRE, by Sebastian Junger. (Perennial/ HarperCollins, $13.95.) In this collection of magazine essays and news articles, which includes a new essay on the American military campaign in Afghanistan, the author of ''The Perfect Storm'' investigates subjects as varied as wildfire fighting in the American West, whale hunting in the Caribbean and the massacre of civilians in Kosovo. ''The stories in 'Fire' cut straight to the heart of whatever Junger is reporting,'' Paula Friedman said here last year. ''He is especially good on the terrifying realities of life perched near the front line of war.''    WOMEN AND OTHER ANIMALS: Stories, by Bonnie Jo Campbell. (Scribner, $12.) The women stalking this collection of short fiction are desperately hungry for affection or freedom, but are trapped in their run-down farms and cabins, where they tend to booze, eat or smoke too much. It doesn't help that the men in their lives are indifferent or brutal. ''These hard-hitting stories . . . are bitter but sweetened with humor,'' Janet Kaye wrote here in 2000.    HE SLEEPS, by Reginald McKnight. (Picador USA, $13.) An African-American anthropologist collecting folk tales in Senegal finds himself tormented by sexually menacing dreams, even as he is drawn into a dangerous relationship with his adopted family. This novel is ''a sly, deep, perverse study of black middle-class alienation,'' Brigitte Frase said here last year.

Now, he has exchanged the trumpeter for a pianist in his new quintet, which performed on Saturday night at the Equitable Auditorium. The shift in lineup has altered the quintet's style, moving closer to conventional hard-bop than Mr. Holland has been since the 1960's.    It's an expert hard-bop group, cruising with aplomb through the odd meters, modal and extended harmonies, meditative ballads and quick-changing uptempo melodies that are hard-bop staples. Robin Eubanks, on trombone, starts solos with warm, forthright melodies and builds up to headlong rushes. Joe Lovano, on tenor and soprano saxophones, plays lines that snake in and around the harmonies, climbing to controlled squeals. Mr. Holland combines utterly secure intonation and the knowledge of when to bear down on a riff, when to add tuneful counterpoint. And Marvin (Smitty) Smith on drums adds explosive dynamics to the music, thudding out a calm rhythm with mallets or pushing soloists with volleys of crescendoing drumrolls.

It is a terrific show, well paced and handsomely installed, with illuminating quotations from the artist printed directly on the wall. It provides New York with its most extensive look at the achievement of this influential Californian, now 60 years old, a Conceptual artist par excellence whose interweavings of language and appropriated photographs made him a major precursor to the art of the 1980's.    To walk through this exhibition is to see premonitions of the 80's efforts of David Salle and Eric Fischl (both of whom were students of Mr. Baldessari's when he taught at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia), as well as Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holzer and Cindy Sherman. The work on view dates from the late 1960's to the present and covers almost the entirety of Mr. Baldessari's art, which started out strong and has gotten consistently better, more accessible and also more profound. In this regard, the show as a whole has a traditional and eminently satisfying shape, despite Mr. Baldessari's penchant for eccentric materials and processes that some may find unconventional or even \\"anti-art.\\" Review/Art","excerpt":"Conceptualism From California"},{"year":"1944","title":"23 accused of thefts from inter-state shipments, NYC THEFT CASES UP IN COURT","excerpt":"Concern $10,000 in Razor Blades, $100,000 in Cotton Goods"},{"year":"1959","title":"The latest monthly report of the National Association of Purchasing Agents describes business as booming.
