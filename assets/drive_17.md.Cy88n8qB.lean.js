Many generals once believed that it was the large-scale bombing of Germany that ultimately brought about the Nazis' surrender. They were wrong. \\n\\nCasualties among the coalition troops massing for the ground war in the Persian Gulf may well be reduced by the pounding the Iraqis have taken. But air power has not been enough to do the whole job any more than it was during World War II.\\n\\nNazi military productivity was five times higher at the end of the war than at the beginning. And that was in the face of more than 10 million tons of bombs dropped on gun, tank, airplane and oil factories.\\n\\nHitler easily thwarted our 1,000 bomber raids. He built plane and submarine factories deep underground. He divided tank production among a dozen different factories, and assembled the tanks in yet another.\\n\\nInstead of a few huge refineries producing vast amounts of fuel, Hitler constructed hundreds of mini-refineries that were invisible from the air -- in apartment buildings, garages, barns -- that kept producing the same total amount as the giant facilities had, long after the exposed refineries were pulverized.\\n\\nAmerica's bombing effort in Europe generally had no more success against combatants. When the Italian campaign was stalled at Monte Cassino, all the bombers in the Mediterranean theater were launched against this one structure. When the smoke cleared, the abbey stood, German defenders were still alive and the stalemate continued. This failure forced the downgrading of the Air Force's role in Italy.\\n\\nThe decision to land at Salerno, based on the effective range of aircraft rather than sound tactics, also led to disaster. The beachhead, ringed by hills, was suicidal. Yet Salerno was chosen because bombers could reach it more easily than other potential invasion sites. The planes did not annihilate the Germans, and Americans were slaughtered.\\n\\nIn the euphoric first days of Operation Desert Storm, we heard that Baghdad's power, water and telephone lines were destroyed, that most enemy planes were wiped out on the ground and that all airfields had been made inoperable. These definitive statements were partly or entirely retracted soon afterward.\\n\\nOur troops have reason to trust that air power will make their job somewhat easier. But if any have deluded themselves into thinking their suffering will be lighter, they have done themselves a disservice. This war, like most wars, will have to be fought and won hand-to-hand.

The wise passenger will learn where the pitfalls lie and how to deal with them effectively.   Despite persistent price-cutting on competitive routes, most major airlines are in economic difficulty. They are nibbling at amenities that passengers have long taken for granted, and they have been experimenting with penalties for passengers who cancel bargain tickets. Meanwhile, the Civil Aeronautics Board - the Federal agency that oversees airline services - is gradually easing its rules and consumer-protection services as it prepares to go out of business by January 1985, as required by the three-year-old Airline Deregulation Act.   What does all of this mean for the airline passenger?  Among other things, there is substantially less assurance than a year ago that a traveler who abhors smoking will get a seat in a nonsmoking section. If you are denied a seat on a plane because of overbooking, even though you hold a confirmed reservation, your rights to compensation are likely to be less. If you are stranded at an airport because of a storm or other ''act of God,'' the airlines are less likely to provide you with free meals and lodging, or even to help you fend for yourself.

Louise Brooks said she learned to act by watching Graham dance and to dance by watching Charlie Chaplin act. And it's worth remembering that America has made its boldest contributions to theater through musicals and through dance: the spiritual intimacies of modern dance and the social intricacies of vernacular dance.    A play has to depend on the tensions its story and characters incite. Dances and musicals have tension built into them, tension that starts with the pull between a body and the music it moves to, or between words and music: the demands of speech and the strictures of song. It's a contest and a courtship from the start; it spurs our senses and keeps our loyalties shifting in unexpected ways. 'L'Allegro, Il Penseroso Ed Il Moderato'     The choreographer Mark Morris's \\"Allegro, Il Penseroso ed Il Moderato\\" is a wonderful theater piece.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony, one of Japan's top-tier orchestras, has its own financial challenges, and in its recent negotiations it suggested a radical fix: performance-based contracts, under which musicians' raises and promotions -- or, perhaps, their departures -- would be based on ''objective'' evaluations by management. It was a first for Japan (and generally remains unknown in the United States, where even merit pay has been anathema to performers' unions). But the Tokyo Metropolitan's musicians, fearing their employer's demise, agreed to accept the new system on a trial basis this fall.    ''We finally decided to agree to introduce the contract-based system, as we did not have any other choice in order to continue the orchestra,'' said Kaori Minamiyama, a viola player and union leader. The ensemble (pictured below), which is sponsored by the Tokyo metropolitan government, has had its subsidy cut by more than a third over the last five years","excerpt":"Akira Kojima, the orchestra's general secretary, said, ''By introducing this system, we would like to improve the quality of the orchestra as well as to get more support by taxpayers.'' But the musicians still have qualms. ''They say that we will be in a friendly competition and improve our performance more in this new system,'' Ms. Minamiyama said, ''but I think in an opposite way, actually: if we are not guaranteed a stable life, how can we be intent on our performance?''    The criteria for judging the musicians are still being discussed, but in addition to straightforward musical performance, they're likely to include attendance, onstage manners, teamwork and helping to publicize the orchestra. Current members can elect to remain in the traditional lifetime-employment system, but about 70 percent have chosen the new contracts, according to Ms. Minamiyama. That's no surprise: while poor evaluations could lead to a musician's contract's not being renewed, the top salary under the new system is about $72,000 a year versus $62,600 under the old.
