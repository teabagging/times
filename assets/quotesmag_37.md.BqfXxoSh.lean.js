pol implications have been considerable as Goldin's stock has risen and Beame's longtime reputation for fiscal expertise has suffered; Goldin says that his repr Steve Clifford was told by Beame's staff that bank accts, which were generally known to be out of balance for yrs, had been ‘reconciled'; reconciliation was effected by taking final disparity discovered by Beame team, about $6‐million, and simply setting it aside late in ‘73 as separate reserve fund; says Beame assts ‘absolutely’ did not tell Clifford how reconciliation was effected;
