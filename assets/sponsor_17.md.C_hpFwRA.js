Mr. Bush's videotaped message, prepared for broadcast in the Soviet Union on Tuesday, was in some ways the warmest of the greetings in the exchange between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union that began in 1986.    This year's greeting nevertheless struck a more cautious note than Mr. Bush's message of 1989. It dropped the references to his personal relationship with President Gorbachev that marked last year's remarks.   This year Mr. Bush mentioned Mr. Gorbachev, but only to wish him a happy New Year. Instead, he made more general comments about Soviet-American ties.   \\"This year, our two countries, as wellas those around the world, have much to be grateful for -- first and foremost the improved and strengthened relations between the United States and the Soviet Union,\\" Mr. Bush said.   On the Persian Gulf crisis, he said, \\"I applaud, the world applauds, the decisive action of the Soviet Union in strongly opposing Saddam Hussein's brutal aggression in the gulf.\\"    Unlike Mr. Gorbachev, who videotaped a message to the American people for broadcast here, Mr. Bush made no reference to the summit meeting that is to take place in Moscow from Feb. 11 to 13. Administration officials said the omission was not intended to signal a possibility that the meeting would be called off.   Cable News Network planned to show both messages at about 1 P.M. on Tuesday, a spokeswoman said. Officials at the broadcast networks said portions of the tapes were likely to be used as news items on Tuesday's evening broadcasts.    The officials said the shift in emphasis between last year's message and the one Mr. Bush taped this year reflected new uncertainties about the Soviet leadership.   But they said Mr. Bush's comments were not intended to be specifically critical of Mr. Gorbachev, to whom American policy toward the Soviet Union is closely tied.   The officials said Mr. Bush's message had been taped before Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze resigned. While Administration officials have expressed concern about how the resignation might affect Soviet foreign policy, Moscow has emphasized continuity in its ties with Washington.

Gorbachev:  OPENING STATEMENTS    BUSH: Well, may I say that it was a pleasure to have President Gorbachev in this embassy. We've made a good deal of progress and we will -- he might have something to say about how much progress. But from the standpoint of the United States and the economic front and the arms front, we are very pleased with this meeting. . .    GORBACHEV: Mr. President, it was very short and that's because of the circumstances. In fact, we didn't have a lot of time at our disposal, but we used it very well and very productively, and we were able to talk about quite a few things. . .    Now, what I wanted to say was, in view of the fact that we were told that all of the issues are solved on the Start treaty, we, with the President of the United States, have agreed to finalize everything in Geneva, and we will give commensurate instructions so that we could then sign that treaty. . .    Once again, I have invited the President to come to the Soviet Union on a visit at the very end of July. And I hope that everything is clear now about the visit. The visit will take place. The Soviet people, all of us, will be ready to give our hospitality to the President of the United States, and I also hope to Mrs. Bush, and to all those who will accompany him to Moscow. . . .    And the last point -- the President and I have had a discussion within the framework of what is happening in the context of this unique meeting with the G-7. And we are pleased with the kind of discussion that has taken place on those issues. So, I'm through.   BUSH: May I simply say that we accept with pleasure President Gorbachev's invitation. I hope we can get a lot done. And we've already accomplished a lot in treaty negotiations. The goal, of course, is an economic goal. We'd be cooperatively working with President Gorbachev, and I would say the rest of the G-7 and the rest of the world in integrating the Soviet economy into the rest of the world's economies.                    . . .       QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS    Q. Does this mean you have a Start treaty ready to sign now, and you are going to Moscow, and everything is on the line? Who caved? Who gave in?   BUSH: . . . There was compromise on all sides and it's in the best interest of the United States, and I hope that the Soviet people feel it's in the best interest of the Soviet people.   Q. Well, does that mean that you will not build a new missile?   GORBACHEV: Let me say, I share what the President has just said. We will not be able to succeed either today or tomorrow in building new international relations, new international security, in achieving a balance of interest in the world, if we try to achieve advantage and if we try to win. We have to move reciprocally toward each other in the interest of both our peoples.   And I hope very much that the meeting that will take place in Moscow will be in the interest of all mankind, of all those who will be able to now breathe more quietly and to say that we have moved further away from the threat of nuclear war.   Q. What's the date -- pin it down?   BUSH: Well, we're pinning it down, but I'd say the very end of July.   Q. How long will the summit be?

Bill Clinton's credibility on the draft. Bush aides said the 30-second ad would appear for several days in select markets nationwide but would not specify which ones.   ON THE SCREEN -- Extreme close-up of a grainy black-and-white photograph of Bill Clinton slowly enlarges to reveal it is the picture of Mr. Clinton on a recent Time Magazine cover, with the headline, \\"Why Voters Don't Trust Clinton.\\" The camera zeros in on the words in quick succession, and finally shows the entire cover, which is an ominous-looking photo-negative image of the face.

As George Bush got ready to leave Houston yesterday morning and fly back to the capital, he took a call from one of the few senior Administration officials who had remained loyal to the end. Could he have been better served by the people in charge of his campaign? the official asked, in an account of the conversation. Frustration and Anger    \\"Don't get me started on that,\\" the President snapped, his voice raw with anger, frustration and blame. THE 1992 ELECTIONS: DISAPPOINTMENT -- ROAD TO DEFEAT Sifting Strategies: What Went Wrong, and Right","excerpt":"Bush: As the Loss Sinks In, Some Begin Pointing Fingers"},{"year":"1992","title":"The Bush campaign began broadcasting a new 30-second commercial yesterday. The campaign said it would get national exposure but would not be specific.   ON THE SCREEN -- Opens with a black screen that fades into the legend, \\"Here's what Clinton economics could mean to you.\\" The announcer says Mr. Clinton has promised to raise taxes only on the rich but that the real story is different. In a departure for campaign ads, the announcer is a woman. The camera then cuts to quick shots of taxpayers, showing their name, occupation and the amount the Bush campaign says their taxes would go up under Mr. Clinton. The ad ends with the new Bush slogan about a Clinton Presidency: \\"It's wrong for America.\\"   TELEVISION SCRIPT -- Announcer: \\"Bill Clinton says he'll only tax the rich to pay for his campaign promises. But here's what Clinton economics could mean to you. (John Canes, steam fitter) $1,088 more in taxes. (Lori Huntoon, scientist) $2,072 more in taxes.   \\"One-hundred leading economists say his plan means higher taxes . . . and bigger deficits. (Julie and Gary Schwartz, sales representatives) $1,191 more in taxes. (Wyman Winston, housing lender), $2,072 more in taxes.   \\"You can't trust Clinton economics. It's wrong for you. It's wrong for America.\\"   ACCURACY -- Mr. Clinton's promise to tax only the rich is faithfully repeated.   But the estimated tax burdens for the five people mentioned in the commercial are based on economic proposals for which Mr. Clinton has not provided enough information for such detailed analysis or on figures that do not always follow Mr. Clinton's proposals.   The Bush team says Mr. Clinton's estimates of how much he would raise by taxing the richest Americans are wrong. They say that to pay for his programs, people earning somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000 a year will have to pay the higher rate.    But the Bush campaign uses figures that cannot be reconciled with Mr. Clinton's figures. Bush aides acknowledged that they were making a leap of logic: that Mr. Clinton would not have enough money to keep his campaign promises and will therefore tax the middle class rather than revising his plans.    The ad makes no mention of Mr. Clinton's proposal for a $60 billion tax cut for the middle class.   SCORECARD -- As it fine-tunes its attack on Mr. Clinton, the Bush campaign is trying to paint him as a tax-and-spend liberal. The spot also tries to portray Mr. Bush as the protector of the middle class, which the Democrats say has been badly burt by 12 years of Republican leadership in the White House. The use of the steam fitter seems intended to identify Mr. Bush with the concerns of blue-collar workers and the overall tone of the ad fits neatly into the appeal to suburban voters that is central to Mr. Bush's electoral strategy.

ON THE SCREEN  Opens with a white-on-black phrase, \\"Breakfast, St. Louis. After the debate.\\" The buzz of conversation and the clinking of plates and silverware are audible in the background. The screen cuts to quick clips of eight people seated in booths at a restaurant. Each voices a concise opinion of Bill Clinton or Mr. Bush as a hand-held camera zooms in and out and rocks unsteadily. Closes with a small disclaimer, \\"Paid for by Bush-Quayle '92 General Committee Inc.\\" PRODUCER The November Company THE SCRIPT  First Man: \\"I saw the debate last night, and I just got one conclusion, It's all George Bush.\\"  First Woman: \\"I have, I still have a lot of confidence in my President.\\"    Second Woman: \\"I feel we need Bush to keep us from a big-spending Congress.\\"  Second Man: \\"I don't trust Clinton.\\"  Third man: \\"The man says one thing and does another.\\"  Third Woman: \\"First he denies it and then he says, well, maybe it happened. You can't trust him.\\"  Fourth Woman: \\"Clinton gets in, what we're going to see are more taxes.\\"  Fourth Man: \\"One thing that's got me definitely for Bush is, I remember what happened the last time we did things the way Bill Clinton wants to do them.\\" ACCURACY  The Bush campaign says the commercial was filmed at an International House of Pancakes restaurant in St. Louis on Monday morning, the day after the first presidential debate. Campaign officials say none of the eight speakers are actors or paid Bush workers, but that some of the people are known Bush supporters.  SCORECARD  The commercial seeks to promote Mr. Bush as the debate winner, and Mr. Clinton as an untrustworthy rival, while avoiding serious problems that dogged past political attacks. Example: Polls show many voters don't believe charges made by the Bush organization. So this commercial lets average people make them instead. Example: Voters are primed to be suspicious of negative political advertisements. So the jerky camera and the absence of an announcer in this one try to convey unsophisticated believability, not political slickness. Example: Mr. Bush's personal attacks on Mr. Clinton seem to generate a backlash, so Mr. Bush is absent from this commercial.

One in six Boeing airplanes is now bought by China. Bosnia and Somalia don't buy many semiconductors. So the Clinton Administration's focus is shifting southward to Mexico now that the North American Free Trade Agreement is in place and eastward to the Pacific, through a summit meeting of the 15-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. This trend will continue in 1994, pushing the ascendency of trade interests in global diplomacy. What used to be called North-South trade, and might now be better termed inter-developmental symbiosis, has become the crucial issue for growth. The symbiosis is between the cheap labor and fast-growing markets of the \\"South\\" and the technology and new job-creating exports of the \\"North.\\" In foreign policy terms, it means less attention for traditional partners like NATO and more for the developing nations that can create jobs and wealth in America. By Roger Cohen. C3  One World, One Consumer    Alfred M. Zeien, Gilette's chairman, learned a seminal lesson during his years abroad for the company -- shoppers in Caracas or Bangkok want the same merchandise as those in Chicago or Boston. Acting on this insight after he landed Gillette's top job, Mr. Zeien has transformed the company from a multinational corporation into a global one. The difference: While multinationals spend millions to alter products to suit the tastes of different countries, global companies try to sell the same razor or coffee maker to everyone. Global marketing works often enough these days at Gilette and elsewhere to have come of age, changing the criteria for top executives. By Louis Uchitelle. C3  Business Be Nimble","excerpt":"Business Be Quick     Forging a global business strategy isn't easy, as companies large and small are learning. The winners constantly adapt and innovate, both to change internally and to grab new customers. For example, ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Zurich-based industrial giant that operates 1,300 companies in 140 countries, overcame recession in Western Europe by using its global reach to shift into Asia and Eastern Europe. For years Latin American companies hid behind tariff barriers and took consumers for granted. But economic growth and low inflation led Bunge & Born S.A., South America's largest consumer products company, to focus on consumers by selling businesses and concentrating on a handful of industries. The common thread? Be nimble and take nothing for granted. C4&5  At Home, Forecasters' Cheer     Five economists daring enough to climb out on a 1994 limb have assessed the prospects for growth, employment, inflation and interest rates and find themselves huddled together for warmth. Their real gross domestic product forecasts range from 2.8 percent to 3.7 percent; unemployment by year's end from 6.0 percent to 6.5 percent; inflation from 1.9 percent to 3.3 percent; the yearend rate on the 30-year Treasury bond from 5.9 percent to 6.6 percent.

But this breach of the budget is not considered a major problem by Government leaders in Washington because the new GATT agreement will be a bonanza for big business, and that is something favored by Democrats and Republicans alike.   When benefits for working people or the poor are involved, the budget deficit is seen as an insurmountable problem. There is no money for investments in ordinary Americans. But the specter of $42 billion in lost tariff revenues over the next decade is met with a shrug by the movers and shakers in Congress and the White House. As long as it's for business -- well, then, that's all right.

There is no overt violence or melodrama in this laborious day-by-day account of the kidnapping of the film maker's 20-year-old sister, Sylvia, in 1985 by 10 armed men while she was on her way to school.    It took three months of telephone negotiations between Sylvia's father, a banker in Bogota, and the kidnappers to secure Sylvia's release.
