The arrival yesterday, via Vienna, of \\"The Story of Vickie\\" at the Normandie and Eighty-fifth Street Theatres is at least the fourth filmed fictional footnote to that storied monarch's career. Unfortunately, \\"Vickie,\\" who was never lovelier, and her exalted entourage indicate that royal romance ran be charming but unimaginative and that pomp and circumstance are not necessarily moving.Ernst Marischka, who wrote and directed this import from the Queen's own diaries and a comedy by SilVara, takes an awfully long time and many lengthy, stately speeches to spin his story. Originally titled \\"Maedchenjahre einer Koenigin\\" (\\"Girlhood of a Queen\\"), it takes the teen-aged princess through her engagement to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg. Herr Marischka was fortunate in his use of sumptuous sets that appear made to order for the Technicolor cameras. The ballrooms, throne rooms and various apartments of the simulated Kensington Palace are regally glittering, colorful and vast.In his choice of Romy Schneider to portray the nubile princess, he also has struck gold. A teen-ager herself, Fraeulein Schneider nevertheless reflects the experience gained through appearances in about a dozen other European films and the tutelage of her mother. Magda Schneider, the noted German actress, who also is featured as her lady-in-waiting.Fraeulein Schneider professionally reflects the childlike verve and vitality of youth and the confusion of a sheltered youngster suddenly shackled with the awesome responsibilities of sovereignty. The vivacious brunette and photogenic actress also makes the somewhat saccharine encounter with the Prince—an affair reminiscent of an old-style operetta romance – a gay and tender tryst.Adrian Hoven is properly tall, dark, handsome and respectful as her Prince Charming. Karl Ludwig Diehl is a reserved, compassionate instructor as her Prime Minister, as is Magda Schneider in the role of her trusted Baroness Lehzen.Rudolf Vogel, as a valet, and Paul Horbiger, as Prince Albert's mentor, contribute a few light moments to this royal road to romance.

But the producers, who have tackled a pitiable problem, appear to have been uncertain whether to approach it neo-realistically or melodramatically. The combination of the two techniques results in a serious effort that only fitfully leaves a impression.Silvio Siano, who wrote and directed, has not arrived at much of a solution to this poser. He confronts a viewer with his tatterdemalions—some of whom are homeless and others who live in foster homes—caught in the web of dire circumstances. His camera is focused mostly on Peppino, a wan but indefatigable waif who sells lottery tickets for his foster mother","excerpt":"Stellina, his adoring, tiny girl friend; an understanding Police Commissioner; Peppino's stepsister and her hard-working fiancé.It is almost a foregone conclusion that Peppino, hungry, lonely and desperately searching for love, will fall in with older, case-hardened youths and be involved in crime. The fact is, Signer Siano can only come up with a happy ending by having the essentially guiltless Peppino and Stellina end up as the thankful wards of the Commissioner.Signor Siano, it should be pointed out, has discovered genuinely touching performers in the youngsters who go only by the names of Peppino and Stellina. The former, an 8-year-old, is an expressive moppet, as is the 3-year-old Stellina. They are winsome children, whose portrayals are as natural as their sudden smiles and tears. Tecla Scrano does a solid stint as their tough, conniving foster mother. Brunella Bovo and Marco Vicario are briefly effective as the young lovers, who ironically can marry only after a near-fatal accident brings promise of insurance money. Carlo Tamberlani adds a sympathetic job as the Commissioner who is overwhelmed and frustrated by the desperate poor who live in his bailiwick.Aside from the simple and genuine characterizations of the youngsters, most of whom are unbilled, the great assets of \\"Alone in the Streets\\" are to be found in the streets and other authentic locales of Castellmare. By avoiding the sunny side of the streets Signor Siano has shed light on some of the evils of poverty.

He's too canny to take the romantic Sturm und Drang  swirling around him with less than a healthy grain of salt. The actor's deft touch lends the  flighty story of mistaken identities and romantic mix-ups among mostly African-American characters in Los Angeles a saucy bounce. The movie is so determined to cross the finish line in under 90 minutes that it doesn't pause for logic or psychological sense. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Breakin' All the Rules'"},{"year":"2004","title":"This incoherent documentary about the annual Burning Man arts festival in the northern Nevada desert makes the fatal flaw of cinematically imitating the anarchistic spirit of the event it observes. The 10-day festival, which draws over 25,000 people annually to the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, where they create and then disassemble a temporary city, is a kind of modern-day Woodstock festival with a new-age, survivalist, environmentally sensitive aesthetic. There is no narrator, and the structure that exists is clouded by the new-age mumbo-jumbo of eight principal  commentators. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Confessions of a Burning Man'"},{"year":"2003","title":"Rock music doesn't necessarily have to be sexually provocative, politically  challenging or intensely passionate to be good. Some of the best music from the nerd  sector of the rock world is content to be bouncy, witty, catchy and ironically thought-provoking. They Might Be Giants, the New York cult band, profiled in A. J. Schnack's  affectionate documentary, is the brainchild of John Flansburgh and John Linnell, grade-school chums from Lincoln, Mass., who formed the  Brooklyn-based Giants as a duo and expanded it into a quintet.  The movie is not the typical rock-band saga of glorious excess followed by a  chastening fall from grace and then a glimmer of redemption. A kind of do-it-yourself  manual for independent bands, it has the informal tone and structure of an illustrated  scrapbook with excerpts from concert and television performances, interwoven with  lighthearted testimonials by friends, supporters, collaborators and admirers, and witty  animation. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Gigantic' -- '(A Tale of Two Johns)'"},{"year":"2002","title":"Because Henry Jaglom's satire of Hollywood wheeler-dealers foaming at the mouth with dealmaking fever was filmed two years ago at the actual Cannes International Film Festival, its setting initially reinforces the authenticity of its insider's view of that annual shark convention on the French Riviera. A good deal of anger washes through this acerbic portrait of the movie business in histrionically high gear. But so does a lot of sentimentality, and as the sentimentality quotient rises, it erodes the film's credibility. Many of the characters spend the movie baldly lying to one another. Then suddenly, near the end, they pair off and begin hugging and dancing around. The abrupt change from bitter to warm-and-fuzzy just doesn't compute. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Jaws V': A Shark Alert Along the French Riviera"},{"year":"2004","title":"This passionate but crude, unstructured and often articulate documentary eulogizes the multi-cultural, gay-leaning underground dance movement in New York City that coalesced in the early 1970's. It reserves special reverence for the deejays Larry Levan and David Mancuso, who presided  at the Paradise Garage and the Loft: for cultists only. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Maestro'"},{"year":"2003","title":"If this strained, incoherent farce accomplishes anything positive, it will be to drive another nail into the coffin of that exhausted sub-genre, the mob comedy. Danny Aiello is Tony, a New York crime boss who dispatches his incompetent nephew Anthony (Robert Capelli Jr.) to track down and bring back a mail-order bride who cheated several potential husbands (including a pal of Tony's) out  of their money. Once the movie goes to Moscow, it goes from bad to worse. To be avoided. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Mail Order Bride'"},{"year":"2003","title":"A scattershot farce created by members of the comedy  troupe Upright Citizens Brigade, this film touts itself as an example of  Dadaist alternative comedy. What that really means is a jolly but amorphous sequence of  related skits stretched into a feature film. Matt Walsh is Martin Flam, a suicidally inclined  advertising costume designer who places himself in the care of Dr. Orloff (Ian Roberts),  a supremely rude, self-regarding psychiatrist, and they gallivant around New York having zany adventures. The satire of therapy and the advertising business has its amusing moments, but the film lacks a center and the story barely coheres. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Martin and Orloff'"},{"year":"2002","title":"Eric Schaeffer's contemporary sex comedy poses that age-old question: Can a desperately lonely 54-year-old exterminator find happiness with a desperately lonely 54-year-old single mother whom he meets in a gay bar? Yes, yes, yes, the movie gushes, despite the evidence before your eyes that these two people have nothing in common except advanced cases of commitment-phobia and a numerical similarity in age. It's no fault of Jeffrey Tambor, who plays Christopher the exterminator, and Jill Clayburgh, his sweetie pie, Grace, that this relationship appears ludicrous. Comedy, even farce, has to have some grounding in recognizable human behavior if it's to land. But as conceived by Mr. Schaeffer, Christopher and Grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Never Again'"},{"year":"2003","title":"This somber Palestinian film builds suspense as it follows  the quest of Rana (Clara Khoury) a feisty, young Palestinian living in Jerusalem, who must  marry the boyfriend (Khalifa  Natour) whom her father disapproves of by a certain time or  leave Israel.  But on a deeper level, the movie is a meditation on the seething frustrations  of living under a stage of siege. Jerusalem, as seen through the Palestinian filmmaker's  eyes, is a gridlocked power keg where hostile Israeli soldiers aim their guns at the tiniest  hint of trouble and roadblocks and checkpoints make living a normal life almost impossible.  Ms. Khoury offers a deeply sensitive, unsentimental portrait of young woman torn by  doubt in a climate ruled by fear and suspicion. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Rana's Wedding'"},{"year":"2004","title":"Just below the sitcom surface of this smart-talking comedy seethes a bitter critique of the sportive sexual habits of  Southern California's babes-and-hunks culture. Alice (Julianne Nicholson) and Ed (Jay Mohr), an attractive, comfortably monogamous couple about to be married, decide to play around as a premarital treat to themselves before settling down. Alice persuades her reluctant fiancé that having more notches in their respective belts will  fortify their union. Her body count of three encounters simply isn't enough. It all backfires, of course, in jealousy and competition. In real life, the emotions displayed by the characters are much messier and more volatile than the little spats and hissy fits that erupt. But if the movie glosses over uncomfortable realities like jealousy, at least it touches on them. But what does it tell us that the movie's moral grounding wire, Ed's friend, Carl (Andy Richter), is the one younger character who doesn't qualify as a hottie? Plain guys can't play? &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Seeing Other People'"},{"year":"2003","title":"The sardonic, poorly acted rock and roll comedy, about a young musician trying desperately to retrieve a stolen synthesizer, is the cinematic equivalent of a cheesy riff on  a $50 electronic keyboard.

The title takes its name from a classified paper  for musicians buying and selling instruments. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Southlander' -- 'Diary of a Desperate Musician'"},{"year":"2004","title":"It's probably no coincidence that Luke Mably, the skinny English actor playing the crown prince of Denmark, who goes undercover and falls in love with an all-American farm girl, bears a conspicuous resemblance to England's Prince William. With the real prince unavailable, why not create a facsimile from another country and bring him to America? The soggy contemporary fairy tale is a cinematic cream puff with a melted marshmallow inside it. As the temperature rises, the whole gooey thing starts to melt. Julia Stiles's heroine is a model of integrity and decency who seems anachronistic in the age of Britney and Christina, especially when she has to choose between marrying the love of her life and becoming the Queen of Denmark and going to medical school. The lopsided movie doesn't have the backbone to sustain conflict for more than a few minutes&#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'The Prince and Me'"},{"year":"2001","title":"Amiable but conceptually muddled, this animated film loosely based on E. B. White's much-loved 1970 children's book about a mute swan who learns to communicate by reading, writing and playing the trumpet is a bland, well-meaning mishmash that never coheres into a dramatic whole. The movie features the voices of Jason Alexander, Reese Witherspoon, Joe Mantegna and Seth Green. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'The Trumpet of the Swan'"},{"year":"2001","title":"Michael Sergio's urban melodrama suggests the contemporary equivalent of any number of 1930's B movies in which an ex-convict who has cleaned up his act strides manfully through his old neighborhood to face down its roiling dangers and temptations. Here, that neighborhood is Astoria, Queens. Mr. Sergio's shrill screenplay is an ungainly mechanical contraption in which every swatch of dialogue rings with the clank of clichéd oratory. With a ponderous self-consciousness, the story builds to a saloon shootout that parodies a standard western showdown. The performances are correspondingly overblown and the soundtrack inundated with grandiose choral music and mediocre hard rock. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Under Hellgate Bridge'"},{"year":"2003","title":"This admiring, hard-headed documentary focuses on Yvonne Bezarra de Mello, a Brazilian human rights activist,  teacher and mother figure to the street children in the slums of Rio de Janiero.  Unflinchingly fearless in the face of violence, drugs, disease, hunger and despair, Ms. de Mello, who is viewed as a traitor by the Brazilian upper class, founded the Projeto Uere  (Children of Light), a collection of safe houses with educational materials that has  established a small beach-head of hope and compassion in the midst of poverty and  hopelessness &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden 'Warrior of Light'"},{"year":"1999","title":"What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy (Haley Joel Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist (Bruce Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age mush (think ''What Dreams May Come'' and ''Simon Birch''). When you trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story doesn't begin to add up. Mr. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Mr. Osment's intense portrayal of the tormented child. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden A Boy Who Sees the Dead, and a Psychologist Determined Not to Fail Him"},{"year":"1999","title":"When the American guitarist and producer Ry Cooder assembled a group of all-but-forgotten Cuban musicians to record an album, no one expected that the record would become a phenomenon, selling more than a million copies worldwide and revitalizing the Cuban music scene. Wim Wenders's ebullient documentary follows the group on tour from Amsterdam to New York and includes interviews with the group's main members. The music pulsates, and the pictures of Havana compare the city's grand but faded architecture with the musicians' weather-beaten faces. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden A Cuban Band's Testament To the Powers of the Music"},{"year":"2000","title":"If the seamless romantic drama follows Hollywood formulas, it's not often the rules are followed so deftly. The love story of a young widow with two children and the recovering alcoholic ad executive who comes into her life is told in beautifully understated scenes that come at you sideways. Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck outdo themselves to embody the most soulful romantic coupling Hollywood has come up with in quite some time. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden A Deadly Twist of Fate, A Tortured Conscience And Then Love's Dart"},{"year":"2001","title":"This morally repugnant but occasionally exciting action thriller stars a puffy John Travolta as an all-purpose Mr. Big who recruits one of the world's foremost computer hackers (Hugh Jackman) to help him carry off a $90 billion electronic robbery. With the funds he plans to bully anti-American terrorists into submission, wherever they operate. Halle Berry is his possibly duplicitous partner. The plot is so preposterous that it makes even the James Bond movies it imitates seem realistic. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden A Feverish Thriller That Leaves No Car Unturned"},{"year":"2003","title":"This feel-good romantic comedy pits the proud, chaste widow of a New Bedford  fisherman (Sofia Milos) against a penniless English card shark (Jason Isaacs) who falls in love when he  hears her sing Portuguese fado songs in a local restaurant, and seduces her with lies. The  movie wants to portray the formidable widow and the toxic twit as an appealing odd  couple (something like Hugh Grant and the young Anna Magnani) who click, but Mr. Isaacs's gambler is such a louse that no amount of contrition can earn him sympathy &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden A Journey From Mourning to Moonlight"},{"year":"2001","title":"Can a lonely marketing maven (Meg Ryan) in contemporary New York find happiness with a handsome, courtly Victorian duke (Hugh Jackman) transplanted from 1876 to the present? What do you think? The elaborately plotted sci-fi romantic comedy barely touches on reality, and therein lies its wispy charm. Mr. Jackman's time-traveling dreamboat consistently outshines Ms. Ryan's snippy cynical New Yorker. Liev Schreiber is her eccentric ex-boyfriend who sets the machinery in motion. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden A Knight Astride A White Charger"},{"year":"2001","title":"The movie's Greek island setting may be gorgeous, but the screen adaptation of a much-loved novel by Louis de Bernieres is wooden and mechanical. If you imagined that an epic story set in World War II and involving battles, an earthquake and heroic self-sacrifice couldn't be dull, think again. Nicolas Cage is a happy opera-loving Italian army captain, Christian Bale a fisherman  who becomes a fierce Greek partisan and Penélope Cruz the doctor's daughter they both love. Hear the actors struggle with adopted foreign accents and feel their lack of romantic  chemistry. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden A Mandolin Is a Weapon in a Laid-Back War"},{"year":"2000","title":"When a simple Spanish woman (Maria Galiana) makes a rare journey to the city to be with her husband, who is having surgery, she stays with her embittered, alcoholic daughter (Ana Fernandez) who works for a cleaning service. Ms. Galiana's eloquent, utterly unsentimental portrayal of a woman who expects little of life is an extraordinarily moving portrait of unconditional love gradually working its wonders. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden A Mother's Selfless Love and Dignity"},{"year":"2004","title":"It's painfully understandable why the 17-year-old title character of this gripping Colombian film would risk her freedom and even her life to be a drug mule. The movie follows the desperate plunge of Maria (Catalina Sandino  Moreno) from a dead-end job as an assembly-line worker in a Colombian flower factory  into the drug-smuggling underworld. Her dangerous undertaking is her last resort when she finds herself unemployed and pregnant. Before the story zeroes in on the harrowing details of drug running and its dangers, it details Maria's hopelessly circumscribed life in a rural village. If her story is a template for countless others like it, what keeps your heart in your throat is Maria herself. In a performance that feels more lived in than acted, Ms.  Moreno's Maria is an attractive, smart, spirited young woman who faces the challenge of  fending for herself with a fierce determination and ingenuity that compromises but never  undermines her essential decency and morality. The movie sustains a documentary authenticity that is as astonishing as it is off-handed. Even while keeping you on the edge of your seat, it never sacrifices a calm, clear-sighted humanity for the sake of melodrama or cheap moralizing. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden A Mule's Long Trek in Search Of the North American Dream"},{"year":"2001","title":"This likable film about the 1969 Apollo XI mission as experienced in Australia recalls the crucial role played by a  satellite dish outside of the rural town of Parkes, New South Wales, in transmitting live  images of the moon landing. Although much of the story is a race against time to correct a  malfunction, the easygoing movie is really a quirky, affectionate portrait of late-60's rural  Australia waking up from its bucolic innocence to the wonders of the modern world. Sam Neill  is the courtly, widowed operator of the dish. The cloying rah-rah self-congratulation that  usually is affixed to this event is kept to a minimum. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden A Weak Link, But You Still Want to Cheer"},{"year":"2002","title":"For all of us, an unfortunate part of being alive is behavior that we would have to acknowledge, however reluctantly, as sick or dysfunctional (to use the more pretentious and clinical-sounding term that has become fashionable). But exactly where is the line separating everyday emotional instability and neurotic compulsion from serious mental illness? That question haunts Ole Christian Madsen's disturbing, somewhat repellent portrait of a depressed middle-class woman's struggle to live comfortably in the world. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden A Woman Walking the Edge of Madness"},{"year":"2003","title":"This superbly balanced and organized documentary about the politics of electricity in the  former Soviet Republic of Georgia portrays a country teetering on the brink of chaos. Its vision is seen largely through the eyes of Piers Lewis, a good-humored British-born  project director for AES-Telasi, the Arlington, Va.-based company that was created in  late 1990's when AES acquired the Georgian power authority, Telasi. At the time, AES  officials had no idea what they were up against. And the story of the company's struggle  to become efficient and profitable in a country where 90 percent of the citizens refused to pay  electricity bills that amounted to half their monthly income plays like an absurdist  political farce. Among the many factors held accountable are globalization, the  corruption of the country's (now-ex) president, Edward Shevardnadze, and the character  of the Georgians themselves. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden American Know-How Can't Prevail Nohow"},{"year":"1998","title":"If the gothic-romantic special effects in this turgid pop fable set in the afterlife are some of the trippiest ever devised for a serious drama, this sudsy fantasy about married soul mates who meet after death never comes emotionally alive. Robin Williams is at his fake-sincere worst as the world's most devoted husband who dies in a car crash and goes to heaven. Annabella Sciorra is simply blank as the wife who commits suicide and must be rescued from hell. Cuba Gooding Jr., glaringly miscast, plays Mr. Williams's angelic guide. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Apparently, the Afterlife Is Anything but Dead"},{"year":"2002","title":"Sandra Goldbacher's small, psychologically savvy film is the story of a toxic friendship, established in early childhood, whose poisons continue to circulate and infect both partners well into their adult lives. Every close friendship, of course, has its shadow side of lurking jealousy and competition, even if that shadow is just an occasional twinge of resentment. But from the time they are little girls, Marina (Anna Friel) and her best friend and next-door neighbor, Holly (Michelle Williams), find themselves locked in a power struggle that only Marina is fully aware of for much of that time. Under its drab contemporary trappings, the movie is really a Jane Austen-like moral parable in which goodness is rewarded and selfishness punished. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Best Friends Who Are Also Worst Enemies Struggle in a Web of Emotions"},{"year":"2003","title":"Directed  by Samir, a Shiite Muslim born in Iraq and raised in Switzerland, this fascinating but  disorganized exploration of cultural identity weaves interviews with four Iraqi-born Jews  living in Israel into a meditation on how the movies perpetuate negative cultural  stereotypes. Though the individual stories are absorbing, the two ideas don't mesh comfortably. The most entertaining segment is an interview with the outspoken Israeli film scholar Ella Shohat. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Born in Iraq, Living in Israel, Pondering Issues of Identity"},{"year":"2004","title":"The only real touch of class in the rickety little  romantic comedy is Kyle MacLachlan's dead-on impersonation of Cary Grant's ghost.  Lounging around in a paisley dressing gown, dropping pallid witticisms in Grant's  signature staccato style with just the right accent, the actor finds an easy balance between  affectionate imitation and amusing parody. That ghost haunts the movie's troubled young  protagonist Alim (Jimi Mistry), a gay South Asian Muslim leaving with a British lover in  London. The movie is the latest manifestation of an already stale sub-sub genre: the  multicultural romance in which a gay couple of mixed ethnicity tries to conceal their  relationship from visiting tradition-bound relatives who assume the lovers are  heterosexual roommates. Mr. MacLachlan's Grant is Alim's imaginary advisor. The humor fizzles, and except for Mr. MacLachlan the acting is wooden and overstated. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Cary Grant, Keep an Eye on the Gay Guy"},{"year":"2003","title":"This meandering story of a professional hit man who travels  from Brooklyn to Buenos Aires to carry out a political assassination is pretty much a one-man show for Robert Duvall. The actor, who also co-produced, turns in a thoughtful, lived-in portrait of his deeply divided character, John Anderson. Professionally, John has a heart  of stone, but in his private life, he is a vain, sentimental mush pot who dotes on his  girlfriend's 10-year-old daughter. Once in Buenos Aires, John, an amateur ballroom with  Valentino-ish pretensions, he discovers the tango and has a discreet flirtation with a  dancer (Luciana Pedraza). With its perfunctory dance sequences, rambling dialogue and  sketchy plot development, the movie never coheres into a drama that's credible or  gripping. Mr. Duvall's performance is the main event. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Crime Boss Hires a Killer With a Sentimental Side"},{"year":"2000","title":"This snazzily designed, crisply paced sci-fi horror film follows the survivors of a crash-landing on a distant planet as they fight off swarms of bat-type carnivores who streak out of the ground after a solar eclipse plunges the desertlike outpost into total darkness. Although the lighting never gets as pitch dark as the title implies, the movie is scary enough to make you remember when you needed a night light to get to sleep. And Vin Diesel, as a hulking, thuggish convicted murderer who turns out not to be as evil as he first appears, demonstrates major action-hero potential. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Dark and Dismal Doings on a Planet With Three Suns"},{"year":"2000","title":"In the mold of Christopher Guest's earlier cult favorites, ''This Is Spinal Tap'' and ''Waiting for Guffman,'' this semi-deadpan satire spoofs the world of dog shows. A cross section of American eccentrics gather with their prized pets at a Philadelphia competition. The humor in this largely improvised film is barbed and condescending but rarely vicious. Like most skit comedy, the whole is somewhat less than the sum of its parts. Great fun, nonetheless. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Dog Owner Eat Dog Owner Kind of World"},{"year":"2000","title":"''Back to the Future'' meets ''Field of Dreams'' meets ''It's a Wonderful Life'' meets ''The Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly sentimental supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Jim Caviezel is a morose young policeman who contacts his dead father, a heroic firefighter, on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the accident that cost him his life during the 1969 World Series. From here, the two collaborate on changing other aspects of the past and on catching a serial killer. There are enough testosterone tears to soak Shea Stadium. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden During Time Warp in Queens, Dead Dad Returns"},{"year":"2001","title":"Despite Kevin Kline's carefully  understated performance in this high-minded weepie about a dying architect mending his  family fences while dying of cancer, the movie sinks into pretentious kitsch after a  bracing start. Mark Andrus's sappy screenplay relentlessly flogs the metaphor of house  building as life, and the family strife is resolved too easily. Kristin Scott Thomas is the ex-wife the architect still loves and Hayden Christensen the rebellious teenage son who mellows into a  pussycat. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Dyspeptic in Paradise, as Life Falls Apart; Then ..."},{"year":"2000","title":"Alternately hilarious, poignant and gory, this modern fairy tale that follows an aspiring nurse (Renee Zellweger), suffering from traumatic amnesia, to Los Angeles to win the love of her favorite soap-opera character is a contemporary ''Wizard of Oz.'' Hollywood is the Emerald City. Greg Kinnear is the self-centered actor who plays her heart's desire on television. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are a sadly introspective hit man and his hot-headed protege who follow her across the country with intention to do harm. This may be the deepest and funniest American comedy since David O. Russell's ''Flirting With Disaster.'' &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Fragile: Handle With Dreams"},{"year":"2003","title":"Mark Ruffalo's puppyish lost-boy appeal almost makes you empathize with his essentially ratty character, Coles Burroughs, a womanizing maker of animated films who settles for a career in advertising. Divided into two parts, the movie begins in the early 90's at Sarah Lawrence College, where Coles falls in love with Sam (Maya Stange) and has a threesome with her and her bisexual best friend, Thea (Kathleen Roberts). In part two, the movie leaps ahead a decade to track the same characters in New York City, where Coles is living with Claire (Petra Wright). When Sam reappears on the scene, he finds he's still in love with her and can't contain himself. Filmed in digital video, the sour little study of Gen X yuppies and their discontents is reasonably convincing and well-acted but very minor. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden From Carelessness to Comfort, But Unable to Outrun Jealousy"},{"year":"2002","title":"The main reason to see this stately screen adaptation of Chekhov's masterpiece is Charlotte Rampling's extraordinary portrayal of Ranevskaya, the sentimental aristocrat who allows her debt-ridden family estate with its beautiful cherry orchard to slip through her fingers. Ms. Rampling gives a character typically played as a grand, dithering ninny a keen self-awareness that makes her immobility in the looming face of disaster all the more painful. Alan Bates is also wonderful as her ineffectual brother. Although not all of the rest of the casting is as on target, the film still delivers a quiet punch. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Grand but Idle In Old Russia, A State of Denial"},{"year":"2003","title":"This picturesque documentary is an exhilarating group portrait of four self-styled tramps and hobos who follow their bliss by illegally hopping freight trains that traverse some of the country's most beautiful terrain. One goal most have in common is to live as far outside the system as possible and not have to pay rent or work for a boss. Lee is a survivalist and anarchist  who lives in the woods and publishes a rail-riding zine. Switch and Baby Girl are a hippie  couple who must give up the lifestyle when they have a baby. Jessica is a restless college  dropout. Achieving such independence, of course, requires a high degree of self-sufficiency and tolerance for physical discomfort. The movie jumps track near the end  when it makes a cursory attempt to put the lifestyle into a broader historical context. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Hopping Freight Trains in the Pacific Northwest in the Twilight of Hobo Tradition"},{"year":"2004","title":"The real history of pop music over the last half century is as much a story of technological  innovation as it is a star-driven genealogy that connects the usual legends in an elaborate  family tree of styles and influences. To hear the producer and recording engineer Tom  Dowd describe his pioneering role in the evolution of studio recording, from monaural to  stereo to multi-tracking to digital, is to begin to understand the degree to which machines,  as much as performers, have shaped the changing sound of pop. Dowd, who died in 2002,  was an engineer and producer on classic recordings by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, the  Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd, as well as jazz legends. In this documentary, which interweaves snippets of vintage performances, reminiscences and tributes, Dowd comes across as a sophisticated but unpretentious studio wizard whose respect for musicians always took precedence over his mastery of gadgetry. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden In a World of Singers, an Unsung Hero"},{"year":"2000","title":"This powerful but gloomy two-and-a-half-hour reflection on marriage, adultery, parenthood and the casualties of sexual warfare has a screenplay by Ingmar Bergman and is directed by his longtime colleague Liv Ullmann as an explicit homage to the master. Unfolding like a brooding autobiographical epilogue to his stormier 1973 masterpiece, ''Scenes From a Marriage,'' it is a sophisticated ghost story in which a frail director (Erland Josephson) conjures the spirit of an actress he once loved and steps into the shoes of his younger self (Krister Henriksson) to relive their affair. That relationship broke up her marriage to a world-famous conductor (Thomas Hanzon) and devastated the couple's young daughter. The movie suggests that major life decisions with tragic consequences may ultimately come down to whims. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden In an Old Man's Reveries, The Past Lives On as Pain"},{"year":"2001","title":"This devastating anti-war film, set in the Balkans, is a dark comedy with a difference. Two wounded soldiers, one a Bosnian, the other a Serb, are trapped together in a trench (no man's land) between enemy lines. A third soldier (a Bosnian), presumed dead, regains consciousness, but cannot be moved because a deadly mine was slipped under his body. What to do? As the soldiers squabble like schoolyard children, United Nations rescue workers and a global television network, each with its own twisted agenda, become involved. This beautifully written, directed and acted slice of absurdism punches you in the stomach. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden In the End, It's About Who Has The Gun"},{"year":"2004","title":"This remarkable if overlong Korean film strips away much of the sentimentality and goody-two-shoes attitudes that the movies traditionally attach to disabled people. At the same time, it coolly indicts an indifferent world that treats its misfits as inconvenient, half-witted children who are easily exploited and abused. Shortly after Hong Jong-Du (Sol Kyung-gu), the learning-disabled middle brother of three sons  in a bourgeois Korean family, returns home after serving three years in prison, he  meets the more seriously disabled Han Gong-Ju (Moon So-ri), who suffers from cerebral  palsy so severe she can't make herself understood. The passionate bond that develops between them brings them joy but leads to personal disaster. The film's extraordinary lead performances refuse to soft-pedal the severity of their afflictions. By not turning away, softening or adopting a saccharine tone, the film breaks through the couple's  isolation (and through our own prejudice and frustration) so that the sweethearts emerge  as full, achingly human characters. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden In Two Who Aren't Normal, A Normal Need for Love"},{"year":"2003","title":"David Cronenberg's bleak minimalist film, adapted from Patrick McGrath's novel (with a screenplay by the author), crawls into the  mind of Dennis Cleg (Ralph Fiennes), a paranoid-schizophrenic man in his 30's who is discharged from a mental hospital into a grim halfway house near where he grew up in  East London. The desolate urban environment mirrors the mental condition of a man  whose warped memories of a homicide two decades earlier come flooding back as he  revisits childhood landmarks. Mr. Fiennes's mumbling, agitated psychotic is an  uncompromising portrait of a sad, creepy wreck. Miranda Richardson is equally disturbing in  the dual roles of his demure mother and a Cockney tart who personify the mother-whore  dichotomy that obsesses Dennis. The recurrent imagery of spider webs, jigsaw puzzles  and tangled string adds an extra layer of poetic creepiness. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Into Sinister Webs Of a Jumbled Mind"},{"year":"1997","title":"Set in contemporary Los Angeles, the brilliant satirical thriller is a profoundly thoughtful meditation on the interplay of mass communications, violence and paranoia in modern life. It is also a computer- and video-age tribute to Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film ''Blow Up'' that explores the limitations of truth as revealed through pictures. Bill Pullman is bracingly feisty as a producer of action-adventure films whose macho brio is shattered after he is carjacked and nearly killed, and he goes into hiding. Andie MacDowell is his neglected wife who seizes his empire after his disappearance. Gabriel Byrne is the ambivalent mastermind behind an elaborate surveillance system that the Government is secretly testing in Los Angeles. While monitoring that system, he is witness to a crime he doesn't understand. Ry Cooder composed the gorgeous, shivering musical score. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Is It Real, or Just a Bout Of Paralyzing Paranoia?"},{"year":"2002","title":"This romantic comedy about a rich piggy  developer (Hugh Grant) and the left-wing lawyer (Sandra Bullock) he hires as his chief  counsel is so vague and undernourished it makes one of Nora Ephron's low-cal  strawberry sodas seem as tempting as a Philip Barry feast. Beyond being entirely unbelievable, Ms. Bullock's yammering Minnie Mouse and Mr. Grant's stammering Prince Charming have zero romantic chemistry. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Is She an Ugly Duckling? No, She's a (Gasp!) Swan"},{"year":"2000","title":"The sweet, funny wisp of a movie starts out as a parody of ''Big Deal on Madonna Street,'' then turns into a child's-eye ''Bonfire of the Vanities,'' before returning to its original mode as a caper comedy. Woody Allen and Tracey Ullman are Ray and Frenchy Winkler, an inept thief and ex-con and his upwardly mobile wife whose cookie business takes off and allows her to indulge her dream of being a Park Avenue hostess. If the movie suffers severely from attention deficit disorder, the jokes are funny (but mild), the screwball comic tone impeccably sustained and Ms. Ullman (putting on her Fern Rosenthal voice) and Elaine May (as Frenchy's dimwitted cousin) delightfully goofy. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Just Take the Money and Run? Nah, She Wants Class and Culcha"},{"year":"2000","title":"John Waters's comedy portrays the ultimate cult director (Stephen Dorff) as a punk madman, part Charles Manson, part Andy Warhol, leading a band of freaky ''cinema terrorists'' in blows against the Hollywood empire. When they kidnap a spoiled star (Melanie Griffith) and force her, Symbionese Liberation Army style, to commit terrorist acts that become their movie in progress, she gleefully takes to her new role. The targets range from Pauly Shore to ''Patch Adams'' to ''Forrest Gump.'' Although smart and funny, the movie lacks the maniacal edge of Mr. Waters's most memorable work. &#a5a","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Lights! Camera! Artillery! This Is All-Out War!"},{"year":"2004","title":"Isabelle Huppert, an actress incapable of making a mawkish gesture, fights tooth and nail to keep this soft-boiled story of an embittered prostitute and her 14-year-old daughter from turning to mush. Even for an actress of Ms. Huppert's severity, however, it's a losing battle, especially when she has to carry around a teddy bear at the end. Ms. Huppert's character, Sylvia, is an abused streetwalker in Nice whose life takes a desperate turn when her daughter, Laurence (Maud Forget), impulsively stabs to death a pimp who has been beating Sylvia. The two flee Nice for the north where Sylvia once led a  bucolic married life. The farther they go, the gooier it gets. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Mother and Daughter, Out Looking for Hope"},{"year":"2000","title":"Mary Harron's sleekly brilliant screen adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's notorious 1991 novel pares away most of the book's gore to portray the main character's homicidal butchery as a high-gloss fantasy. The movie's chic blend of satire, comedy and horror is anchored in a star-making performance by Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, a fashion-obsessed late-80's Wall Street hotshot who goes on a killing spree. Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, Samantha Mathis and Cara Seymour give dazzling cameo performances as the unfortunate women in his life. The movie's message about a soulless surface-obsessed society still applies. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Murderer! Fiend! (But Well Dressed)"},{"year":"2002","title":"The first feature film by Andrew and Alex Smith, twin brothers who grew up in western Montana, is a bleak, lyrical meditation on the frontier spirit and American machismo and its torments. The story is about an embattled relationship between a football coach (and part-time newspaper vendor) and his golden-boy protégé. At the heart of the film are riveting performances by David Morse as the coach, Gideon Ferguson, and Ryan Gosling as Roy Chutney, the high school quarterback he recruits for a regional six-man football team. This promising but confused first film is best viewed as a touching portrait of thwarted, volatile male passion in a world where you could almost say that geography is destiny. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden On or Off the Field, Rough, Raw and Twangy"},{"year":"1999","title":"An astoundingly vital performance by the British actress Janet McTeer makes this small, beautifully acted slice of contemporary Americana a must-see film. Janet McTeer is Mary Jo Walker, a sexy, free-spirited woman with four marriages behind her who travels across the country with her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Kimberly J. Brown). Like few other films, this one captures an intimately loving (though not conflict-free) relationship between a parent and child without becoming saccharine. The director plays Mary Jo's trucker boyfriend, who is only the latest in a series of romantic disasters. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden On the Road With Mom the Sexpot"},{"year":"2001","title":"Stephanie Black's powerful documentary illustrates with an impressive (and depressing) acuity, globalization can have a devastating impact on third world countries. The movie offers the clearest analysis of globalization and its negative effects that I've ever seen on a movie or television screen. The film focuses on the deeply troubled economy of Jamaica and how that country's long-term indebtedness to international lending organizations have contributed to the erosion of local agriculture and industry. Far from being a dry exegesis crammed with graphs, pie charts and talking heads spewing abstract mumbo-jumbo, the film goes directly to the farmers and factory workers whose livelihoods have been undermined. In basic everyday language, they explain how high interest rates have helped devalue the local currency, raising prices for their produce and permitting wealthier countries to import the same products and sell them more cheaply. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden One Love, One Heart, Or a Sweatshop Economy?"},{"year":"2001","title":"Marzieh Meshkini's stunner of a film delivers three vignettes, all meditations on the near-impossibility of escaping the assigned female role in a fundamentalist  Muslim state. Each story contemplates a woman at a different age. The movie is an astonishing directorial debut because it doesn't include a single loose end or extraneous image. What appears on the screen has a starkness that is almost indelible. &#151","excerpt":"Stephen Holden Outrun Fate?
