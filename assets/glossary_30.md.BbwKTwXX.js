Or maybe all the people who saw the show thought they had already seen the Barnes, which, in fact, they hadn't. Despite the hoopla about putting on view an exceptional collection, the traveling show in a sense didn't hint at  what is really exceptional about the Barnes -- namely its eccentric blend of old and new, good and bad, African, American and European art, along with the equally eccentric way Dr. Albert C.

In spite of a few regrettable lapses in content and editing, it is a first-class report on this year's Olympiad and a fascinating, amusing, thrilling show.Opening with a slightly stagey sequence showing the classic ritual of fetching fire from Mount Olympus and the carrying of it by runners to light the eternal Olympic flame, the real excitement begins with a flashback to the winter sports competitions in St. Moritz last winter. Beautifully photographed in color, which sees the setting as the wonderland it is, this phase of the picture is a pageant of sports-amid-scenery in itself. The breath-taking rush of the bobsleds and the \\"belly-whoppers\\" down Cresta Run, the rhythm and grace of the ice skaters and the perilous jumps and downhill plunges of the skiers are shown not alone for the brilliance of the performers but also for the beauty and drama of the scene.And this attitude of observation is studiously maintained throughout as the picture continues with its summary of the summer-time London Olympic games. Only one hint of chauvinism on the part of the British film-makers is betrayed—and that, excusably, in their attention to the Britisher who took second place in the marathon. For the rest, the whole picture takes an eager and impartially objective interest in the vivid activities of the competitors and the drama of the spectacle.American fans may be resentful that no emphasis is placed upon the overwhelming superiority of our athletes in the track-and-field and swimming-and-diving events. They may find it too, just a bit neglectful that the famous contretemps which occurred in the 400-meter relay, when the United States team was temporarily disqualified for an alleged violation is quickly and diplomatically dismissed. One gets only the briefest glimpse of the disputed passing of the baton. And all we are shown of Bob Mathias, the remarkable American lad who won the decathlon, is a glimpse of him standing on the victor's platform after winning his events.But this is consistent with the emphasis which the film places upon the Olympic creed—which is that winning is not as important as taking part. And certainly there is an abundance of regard for the international nature of the games. From the full and rich opening ceremonies, with all the teams passing in colorful review before the King and Queen of Great Britain, around the track and onto the green carpet of Wembley Stadium, to the final, thrilling running of the marathon, the main concern of the cameras seems to be for the picturesque, dramatic episode.And these episodes are countless: The impressive arrival of the Olympic torch, with all the teams ranked to greet it and overwhelmed by the haunting spectacle","excerpt":"Barney Ewell's leaping dance of victory after the finals of the 100-meter dash—a dance which turned out to be abortive when it was revealed that he had lost by a hair to his teammate, Harrison Dillard; the women shot putters; the amazing triumphs of the Dutch woman, Mrs. Fanny Blankers-Koen; the victory of the California crew at Henley against the idyllic beauty of the River Thames. Glimpses of the divers and the swimmers in the cerulean-blue Empire Pool and of the equestrians in Wembley Stadium are handsome and tingling too.Most dramatic, however, of all the episodes is the finish of the marathon after the camera has followed in detail the grueling highlights of the distance run. No event of the Olympiad appears more thrilling or suspenseful than this, and it makes an excellent climax for a most commendable review.A simple, clear commentary which is spoken in part (and alternately) by the Americans, Bill Stern and Ted Husing, and a suitable musical score cap the capable production of Castleton Knight for J.

The chattering, hand-waving contenders appeal for arbitration to the police, and this takes them to headquarters, where more arguing goes on.Finally, breathless and disorganized, the actress arrives at the music hall, where she goes on and sings a number that says, in essence, \\"What a Day!\\"That is all there is to it, and Signorina Magnani shows much less comic style than she has in her later pictures. But she does look young and vibrant, for those who care.Best of the other three items is one in which Aldo Fabrizi plays a mild professor who rallies a faltering wedding party and herds everybody to the church because he has been made irritable by a tight tuxedo. This item, like Signorina Magnani's, is distinguished only by the actor's singular skill at elaborate comedy performance. He is supported by Walter Chiari and Lucia Bose as the bridegroom and bride.The curtain-raiser is a country-bumpkin number about an old tinker (Turi Pandolfini) who stupidly seals himself in an olive-oil jar, and the remaining item is a bit about an abandoned young mother, played touchingly by Miriam Bru.English subtitles by Herman G.

This was clearly demonstrated in his mystical and austere \\"Diary of a Country Priest.\\" It is evident again in his \\"A Man Escaped,\\" known in France as \\"Un Condamné à mort s'est échappé,\\" which came to the Baronet yesterday.Here concentrating his attention upon the quiet resolve of a French Underground prisoner to escape from a Nazi jail during the wartime Occupation, M. Bresson spends an hour and one-half detailing the prisoner's painful preparations and then his perilous execution of the break.It is a raw, lean, mechanical operation, beginning with the man's unblinking realization that he must get himself out of that prison or certainly be put to death, and continuing with his patient calculation and accumulation of the means to get away.He steals a spoon, makes a tool of it, opens a secret portal out of his cell and then scouts among the other prisoners to learn the best avenues of escape. From an unsuccessful escapee, he hears that there is a moat over which he must pass before gaining freedom. For this, he must make himself a rope.So, with a searching eye to detail, M. Bresson documents the enterprise, looking often at the face of the prisoner to comprehend his deliberate, desperate moods. And so, through a train of tense experience, we are brought to know the fervor of the man—the fervor of a condemned man for freedom—and the grim, suspenseful trial of his escape.The picture is based upon an actual account of a prisoner's break from Fort Montluc in Lyons, where, we are told, much of this film was made. The claim is credibly supported by the severity of the scene. And the appearance and behavior of the prisoners are easy to believe.François Leterrier as the principal character is impressively gaunt and engrossed, giving a sure, integrated performance that makes it hard to accept the report that he is an amateur. If so, an exceptional credit must be given the direction of M. Bresson. Charles Leclainche as a second prisoner who is threaded into the escape also plays with remarkable realism.This is not the sort of picture that one should view without knowing what it is. The strain is hard and the reward is limited. But it is a fine reflection of a cruel experience.

LONDON NOTES"},{"year":"1929","title":"The talking pictorial version of Sir James M. Barrie's playlet \\"Half an Hour\\" is by no means a flawless production, but it is for the most part an intelligent combination of shadow and voice, one that makes a far deeper impression than would a silent picture equally well produced. The reason for this is the spoken word. The characters stand out in a more human fashion, in spite of the fact that Barrie here has a naïve melange of irony, satire and straight drama.There is something more real about the way in which the players act in this film, known as \\"The Doctor's Secret.\\" Not that they all give good performances, but that they at least appear to have their minds on the action of the narrative. The learning of the lines has evidently been a boon to them, for in speaking the players could not very well let their thoughts wander. In a silent picture it often happens that performers leave a scene and snatch a few moments of conversation that has nothing whatever to do with their work, and then they return, thinking themselves capable of taking up love or hate, anger and scorn, on the spur of the moment and without any comprehensive idea of what's going on during the scene.This current effort, now at the Paramount Theatre, was produced by William C. De Mille, and while he has done well, it is wide of being an inspired production. Mr. De Mille might easily have made further use of cinematic ideas and often he brings the screen figures to unnecessary close-ups. There is in one scene the half figure of Richard Garson and part of Mrs. Garson's head, the latter being done to remind you that she is in the room, a fact that could never be forgotten inasmuch as her voice is heard.Mr. De Mille's introduction, a first act which did not come from Barrie's pen, is poorly written and equally poorly produced. The audible device on Saturday afternoon did not help matters, for during these initial proceedings the voices sounded as if they were coming through drainpipes. But this was obviously a projection failing which can be remedied.The best acting in this screen offering is contributed by Ruth Chatterton, for she not only rises to the part of Lillian Garson in the dramatic periods, but she plays it so cleverly as to give to it the author's interpretation. Miss Chatterton is ever alert, with a suggestion of a wink, a side glance, a bit of byplay, and always with the full conception of cultured tones as a contrast to her husband's brusque form of speech.Another player who takes full advantage of his part is Robert Edeson as Dr. Brodie. He was a splendid choice for this role. Mr. Edeson is (as he would be on the stage) always thinking of his role and what's being said by the other players. In other words, he is a living unit of this cleverly turned little drama.While H. B. Warner gives to the part of Richard Garson a satisfactory characterization, he does not go about it with the same subtlety or appreciation of Garson's characteristics as does Miss Chatterton in her impersonation of Mrs. Garson. Mr. Warner could have got under the skin of the character more. He could have given a more graphic idea of the self-made man, both in his manner of speaking and in his gestures. Incidentally, Mr. Warner is much too faultlessly attired for this rather uncouth individual with a fair vocabulary.In the opening act of the playlet (which is the second in the picture) one can't say that the quarrel seems very real, for the wife is much too eager to be clever, and even Garson himself indulges in a smart phrase or two. Garson at first has had his bands on his wife's throat. Then she frees herself, and he threatens her if she \\"tries to play any games on him.\\" The calm Lillian then wants to know what form his punishment would take, and she asks whether it would be \\"the knife or Desdemona's pillow.\\"The exasperating Lillian also tells her husband that she can't make up her mind whether green is really her best color. She then asks Garson which color he prefers to knock her about in.This scene ends with Lillian hastening to visit a paramour. She has decided to run away with this Hugh Paton to Egypt, and it is while he is out for a few moments that a tragedy happens. Through it Lillian meets Dr. Brodie, and a few moments later she encounters this physician as a guest in her own house.The arguments during the last act (so to speak) are taken bodily from Barrie's manuscript. They result in suspense and surprises, a wonderful relief after the stereotyped motion picture, for here the story ends as it does on the stage. How awful it would be if Garson and his wife were beheld in a fast embrace as the scene faded out!

Ms. Bergalis is the woman from Florida who says she contracted the AIDS virus from her dentist, a homosexual. Through her testimony before Congress and her family's interviews in the last few weeks, the Bergalises have made their views clear: that there are innocent and guilty people with AIDS, and that the guilty ones -- promiscuous homosexuals and drug users -- are being punished for their behavior. Gay civil rights groups have labeled statements like these homophobic and their views are echoed in the theater, whose own gay community has been severely hit by AIDS.   A factor that furthers the perception of the Bergalis case as a symbol of discrimination among people with AIDS is the family's alliance with William Dannemeyer, a Congressman from California who has publicly distinguished between homosexuals and \\"decent people who acquired the virus innocently.\\" He is also the author of a book, \\"Shadow on the Land,\\" which terms homosexuality \\"a psychological illness.\\"    Robert Montgomery of West Palm Beach, who is the lawyer for the Bergalis family, says there is more to the story than \\"what you read in the papers\\" and he is confident Mr. Blessing will portray the family situation effectively. In addition to the play, he says, Mr. Blessing has been entrusted with all decisions on future book and television deals about the case. Mr. Montgomery recommended Mr. Blessing after he saw a production of his play \\"Eleemosynary\\" at the Theater Club in Palm Beach, and met him.   Tom Viola, the administrative director of Equity Fights AIDS, says, \\"I don't know Lee Blessing, but perhaps he will bring an overview and compassion to all people with AIDS that the government and the media have missed.\\"   Larry Kramer, a founder of both the Gay Men's Health Crisis and the AIDS protest group Act Up and the author of the play \\"The Normal Heart,\\" says: \\"I find Lee Blessing's decision alarming. If he writes something sympathetic to her, it will be flying in the face of what everyone in the theater stands for. I don't think that play stands a chance of opening.\\"   Mr. Blessing did not return calls to his home in Minneapolis, and his agent, Judy Bowles, says the playwright feels it is premature to comment.   Ben Mordecai, the managing director of the Yale Repertory Theater, who has worked with Mr. Blessing, says: \\"I am confident Lee would be sensitive in dealing with this subject. It's too bad that people are reacting before he has a chance to work on it.\\" A New Double Bill of 'Falsettoes'    The bets are on for who will bring \\"March of the Falsettos\\" and \\"Falsettoland\\" to New York. The double bill of one-act musicals by William Finn and James Lapine has been playing to sold-out houses at the Hartford Stage Company, where it ends its run on Nov. 2. Graciela Daniele directed this production, which joins the two musicals set in New York in 1980 and 1981 about Marvin, who leaves his wife and son for a man. Here are some scenarios for what comes next:   Andre Bishop, who will become artistic director at Lincoln Center on Jan. 1, is the frontrunner to move the show to the Vivian Beaumont Theater after \\"Six Degrees of Separation\\" closes on Jan. 5. Mr. Bishop produced both \\"Falsetto\\" musicals separately at Playwrights Horizons, in 1981 and 1990. He has a long-standing affiliation with both Mr. Finn and Mr. Lapine, not to mention with Ms. Daniele, who directed the musical \\"Once on This Island\\" at Playwrights before it moved to Broadway. Also, the physical configuration of the Beaumont, with its thrust stage and steeply raked audience, is almost identical to the space at the Hartford Stage, so the show could move without any extra work.    Two additional benefits of the Beaumont: \\"Falsettos\\" would be eligible for Tony Awards, and in this very slim season has a real shot at winning. And because \\"Falsettoland\\" deals with AIDS, which is not a commercially enticing subject, Lincoln Center can offer its membership of 46,000 as a built-in audience to generate enough positive word of mouth to bring in others.   More potential players include: The producers Elizabeth I. McCann and Terry Allen Kramer","excerpt":"Barry and Fran Weissler; Bernard B. Jacobs and Philip J. Smith of the Shubert Organization, who will see the show this weekend.   Mr. Finn says he is still undecided about the show's future. Ms. Daniele says, \\"Wherever they point me, I'll go.\\" Four Stars for 'Three Sisters'     All directors start auditions with a dream cast in mind, and when they are done, most of those names are no more than memories. But Emily Mann, the artistic director of the McCarter Theater at Princeton, is getting her wish list and then some for her production of Lanford Wilson's translation of Chekhov's \\"Three Sisters,\\" which is scheduled to run from Jan. 7 through Jan. 26. Linda Hunt will play Olga, Frances McDormand is Masha, Mary Stuart Masterson is Irina and Laura San Giacomo is Natasha.    Josef Summer, Jeffrey DeMunn and Mark Nelson will join them.

It is a gentle comedy, more provocative of chuckles than roars of mirth, but the picture drags a bit in spots.Mr. Summerville has the rôle of John Horner, whose pulse beats for the open sea, but whom fate has made a candy butcher on an Albany night boat. Just as he is about to realize his lifelong dream by purchasing a sea-going sloop, his wife, Mary, invests their savings in a ferryboat.Skipper Horner runs amuck. Defying his wife and his relatives, he exchanges his home for the sloop and sets out to sail the seven seas. Despite his boasted knowledge of navigation, there comes a time when all hands believe they are cruising up the Amazon. This leads to a one-sided battle with a United States destroyer, which they have mistaken for an unknown enemy craft. The result of the encounter convinces Horner that the sea is not what it used to be and he returns to Snag Harbor, to his wife and to his ferry.The story lends itself readily to the talents of the fluttery Miss Pitts and the would-be heroic Mr. Summerville. It has many amusing moments and, with the reservation noted earlier, merits a better-than-average comedy rating. Una Merkel, Warren Hymer and Henry Armetta, in the supporting cast, contribute to the entertainment.The Vaudeville Show.The bulk of the applause (if it comes in bulk) for the performers on the Roxy stage this week went yesterday to Paul Gherritz, Karavieff and the Catchalots.
