It is gratifying to observe that Miss Bankhead, who has been somewhat unfortunate with her previous screen vehicles, at last appears in one that really merits attention. And she is not alone in the matter of good acting, for she is supported by the efficient work of Irving Pichel and Harvey Stephens.George Abbott guided the destinies of this picture, which is now at the Paramount. His scenes are extraordinarily compelling, what with pleasing shadows and high lights and expensive settings. Miss Bankhead is also photographed to better advantage than in her other films. She impersonates Elsa Carlyle, who in the course of this chronicle loses $20,000 at gambling at cards and on the stock exchange, and after being compromised in a savage fashion by Hardy Livingstone, an immensely wealthy collector of Oriental art objects and costumes, she shoots him. He, however, lives to do his worst by false testimony in the trial of Elsa's husband, Jeffrey, who persists in saying that he, and not his wife, shot Livingstone.It is no masterpiece as a drama, but it captivates one's attention. Mr. Pichel gives an excellent conception of the sadistic Livingstone, who delights in branding all that he owns with his crest, even women who, like Elsa, fall victims to his ample funds. The loyal husband, Jeffrey, also is finely played by Mr. Stephens.One of the several dramatic sequences is where, after losing $10,000 at cards, Elsa, who is custodian of money received for charity, decides to peculate $10,000, with the hope of making good her losses, by taking advantage of a tip on copper.There is the joyous moment of the husband when he comes home and announces to Elsa that they are rich, for the deal he has just consummated means that they are worth a million. The malignant Livingstone, who has loaned Elsa the $10,000 to save herself from disgrace, insists on her coming to his abode that evening. She asks her husband for the money she wants without telling him that Livingstone had loaned it to her and Jeffrey gives her a check. Livingstone, however, is so great an admirer of Elsa that he insists that the transaction was not a loan but a gift.It is a well-developed tale of its type, nevertheless another one of those pictorial dramas that will make those who dwell on Long Island wonder where all these things happen.Bing Crosby is to be seen on the stage in a production called \\"Romantic Rhythm.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Tallulah Bankhead in a Drama of Love and Money-- Bert Lahr in a Mixture of Melody and Fun.

Carole Lombard, whose attractive shadow is adorning the Paramount's film, \\"No Man of Her Own,\\" also is the principal feminine player in \\"No More Orchids.\\"The versatile Mr. Connolly supplies to this present offering a very definite personality, that of an agreeable and self-sacrificing father, C. Aubrey Smith, who is seen invariably as a genial old man, here acts an irascible, hard grandfather, who is bent on his granddaughter, Anne Holt (Miss Lombard) becoming the bride of a Prince Carlos. The fact that Anne is in love with Tony Gage infuriates the grandfather, who knowing that Bill Holt, his son-in-law, is in financial difficulties, insists that he will not lift a finger to save Bill Holt from jail, unless Anne is wed to the Prince.There are many improbable scenes in this film, but it is handsomely staged and the title, \\"No More Orchids,\\" applies to the life Anne will have to lead if she marries Tony, who has more common sense than money. There is not the least doubt that Anne is infatuated with Tony. She does not hesitate to tell him so on several occasions and finally, to her great satisfaction, she learns that he loves her.Louise Closser Hale affords a good deal of humor as a grandmother, and a good old soul who believes in Anne marrying the man of her choice. This old woman loves her cocktails and whiskies, but she has the good taste never to be seen on the screen in an intoxicated condition.When Anne discovers that her father's bank is tottering, she decides to please her grandfather by becoming a princess. Old Bill, however, is thoroughly unselfish and appreciating that his father-in-law is adamant, he goes out of the picture as a very gallant gentleman.Although C. Aubrey Smith does wel enough with his part, it cannot be said that it is one that suits him. He looks like a man with too much imagination to believe in titles. On the other hand, the rôle of Bill Holt is a capital one for Mr. Connolly. Never for an instant does he let Anne know of his business worries and in the end he arranges that his daughter and Tony are married before he goes on a long journey. Lyle Talbot is pleasing as Tony.A short film, \\"Chalk Up,\\" with the crack billiard player, Willie Hoppe, is exceedingly interesting and it is helped a great deal by Pete Smith's clever running comment Mr. Hoppe does some really remarkable shots. It is a feature that will please every billiard enthusiast.On the Roxy Stage.One of the numbers on the stage program is an appealing arrangement of \\"Cinderella,\\" presented by Frank Cambria.

Even before Shepard Fairey’s Barack Obama “Hope” poster became the focus of legal and ethical scrutiny — for Fairey’s use of Mannie Garcia’s A.P. news photo as the basis of the now ubiquitous image — some design critics and practitioners had already questioned the street artist’s habit of “sampling” existing imagery. A scolding essay by Mark Vallen, entitled “Obey Plagiarist Fairey,” which was published online in 2007, accused Fairey, who created the “OBEY GIANT” project in 1989, of “expropriating and recontextualizing artworks of others.” The booty in this alleged thievery is primarily propaganda imagery from the 1920s (Russian Constructivism and Bolshevist posters) to the 1960s (Chinese Socialist Realism and counter-culture rock posters). However, Vallen’s harsh indictment seems not to have hurt Fairey’s reputation. If anything, the criticism enhances his subversive agenda, as it fosters debate about the line between influence and theft in art and design.  Fairey’s image-making follows the lead of earlier rogue art and design movements, like Dada in the 1920s or psychedelia in the 1960s, as well as the Situationalists in the 1970s, and even the retro/postmodernists (i.e., designers who borrowed passé commercial art styles) in the 1980s and 1990s. Some guerrilla art is rooted in a romantic Robin Hood notion: steal from the powerful","excerpt":"tamper with sacred cows; and avoid getting caught. Fairey has been caught several times, and was arrested on his way to the Feb. 6 opening of a retrospective exhibition of his work at the Institute of Contemporary Art / Boston.  Comparisons have been made between Fairey and Andy Warhol’s transfiguration of the Brillo Box into an evocation of pop culture; he is also linked to the skateboarder practice of ripping off and then satirically twisting mainstream corporate logos and brands by altering a name or symbol. His sensibility is perhaps even more reminiscent of the old Mad magazine advertising parodies and their derivative, Wacky Packs, which send up mainstream products by co-opting and changing their names.

He was 88. Keeler was born in Cleveland on August 3, 1914, the day Germany declared war on France, invaded Russia, and ignited the First World War. A man of wry humor and acerbic wit, he sometimes described his birth as ''the second calamity of the day.'' Keeler graduated Magna cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Dartmouth in 1936, and earned his LL.B from Yale in 1939. He soon joined the Cincinnati law firm of Taft, Stettinius & Hollister, founded by Robert Alphonso Taft, eldest son of William Howard Taft, 27th President and 10th Chief Justice of the United States. Later a U.S. senator, conservative Republican icon, and contender for the presidency, Robert Taft became a mentor and friend to his brilliant young associate. In 1942, Keeler enlisted in the Navy as an ensign and after 2-1/2 years in the Pacific and the Aleutians was discharged as a lieutenant (j.g.). He was made a partner at T.S.& H. in 1953, and gained renown as a trial and an appellate court lawyer during his 43 years with the firm. A scion of the Temple family of east Texas, Keeler also worked with his first cousin, Arthur Temple, Jr., to build the timber business developed to 7,000 acres by their grandfather, Thomas Louis Latane Temple, into the halfmillion-acre East Texas Pulp & Paper Company, which became a principal supplier to Time Inc. When the media conglomerate merged with Eastex in 1973, Keeler and his cousin joined Time Inc.'s board of directors, resigning ten years later in vehement protest of Time's merger with Warner Brothers. Keeler was married twice, first to Florence Field Mithoefer of Cincinnati in 1940, with whom he had five children. After his divorce in 1975, he wed Margaret Palmer Mithoefer of Dorset, Vermont. In addition to his widow, Keeler is survived by his sister Virginia of Green Lake, WI, his cousin Arthur Temple Jr. of Diboll. TX, and by four children, all of California-David, of Slovang","excerpt":"Tanny Keeler-Hodgetts of Santa Barbara; Alison Keeler Carrillo of Santa Cruz; and Melissa Keeler Morris of Santa Barbara. In 1982 Keeler retired from the Taft firm and concentrated on his interest in travel and the arts. He was elected to the Board of Directors of the Cincinnati Art Museum, and with his wife Margaret, endowed part of the renovation of Cincinnati's historic waterfront, as well as the Mary R. Drury Chair of History at the Seven Hills School; he gave the John Whitman Keeler Memorial Theater to the Cincinnati Country Day School in honor of his younger son who had predeceased him in 1993; and he renovated and endowed the golf course at Dartmouth College. Although he and his wife maintained a river-view condominium in Cincinnati, his ''box seat on the Ohio'', they spent most of his later years at their home in Vermont, where Keeler continued his avid enthusiasm for golf well into his 86th year.

Leslie Tonkonow, who organized the exhibition, has chosen to emphasize work by 20th-century art photographers like Walker Evans, Andre Kertesz, Man Ray and William Wegman. Although many of these photographers look to commercial or amateur photographs for aspects of their own style, only a small selection of these vernacular pictures are included in the exhibition, which was shown earlier this year at the Ezra and Cecile Zilkha Galery at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn.    Even so, more than a few pictures in the exhibition are essentially variations on the family snapshot. Lee Friedlander includes himself in the frame, along with his wife and two daughters, in a black-and-white photograph that has a casually cheerful air. Tina Barney, meanwhile, presents a large, intensely colored print of herself and her sons at a family cookout.

At a glance, his idiosyncratic blending of Tanzanian folk song, American blues and jazz and European art music may seem trendy or calculated, but one must admit that he comes by it honestly: He was born in London in 1957, and after studying classical music as a child, he joined the music-theater troupe directed by his stepfather, Roy Hart. But he also spent some time in Tanzania, learning East African musical traditions from his father. Now he teaches voice at New York University.    Listening to his performance, one hardly dared imagine what Mr. Hart Makwaia puts his voice students through, but if they follow his example they are likely to be unusually versatile. In the course of 12 songs, he alternately whispered, roared, growled, sang in a sweet, gently floating tenor and in a full-throated theatrical style, and produced sustained, airy tones that might be likened to the sound of a boiling tea kettle or a howling wind.
