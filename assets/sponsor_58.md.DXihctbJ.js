E!; 10 p.m.    GLAMOUR THEN AND NOW  ''Glamour, New York Style,'' an exhibition of New York fashion and design, begins with finery worn by politicians' wives in the 1700's, continues through the lavish trappings of mid-20th-century performers (like an empire-style jeweled brocade gown with a train of embroidered black velvet worn by Renata Tebaldi in ''Tosca'') and culminates with the present era, including a white silk charmeuse gown worn by Ivana Trump in 1978.

WEDNESDAY 2|16    THREE FILMS IN ONE  ''Cinevardaphoto'' is the unwieldy title of a compilation of three very different short films by Agnès Varda. ''Salut les Cubains'' (1963) represents Ms. Varda's transition from photographer to filmmaker and includes hundreds of stills of her travels in Cuba. ''Ulysses'' (1982) is yet more abstract, a meditation on a photograph she took in the 50's. And ''Ydessa, the Bears, and Etc.'' (2004) is a miniaturist take, a profile of a collector of pictures of teddy bears.  Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village; 1, 2:50, 4:40, 6:30, 8:20 and 10:10 p.m. (Through March 1.)

(March will see them heading to Los Angeles, with stops along the way in places like Manhattan, Kan.)

THURSDAY 2|17    CARE AND FEEDING OF ROBOTS  Three artist-programmers, each of whom specializes in building robots, show and tell how they make machines that mimic humans and create art.

Linder Theater, American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West and 79th Street; 7 p.m.; $15.    MUSIC OUT OF THE HOUSE  Music from Copland House -- a chamber ensemble in residence at the composer Aaron Copland's landmark home in the Hudson Valley -- comes down the river to perform in a less idyllic setting.

FRIDAY 2|18    AFTER BROYARD  Anatole Broyard, the critic and memoirist, died in 1990. His wife, Sandy Broyard, has now written a memoir of her own, ''Standby.'' It tracks how her careers as a dancer and a therapist informed her experience as she dealt with her husband's death, and her own life after that event.  Knopf, $24.    COFFEE SHOP ROCK  Once a month the Housing Works Used Book Café becomes a rollicking, music-filled coffeehouse.

The event opened a dance series in the Arts at University Settlement program, which offers performances and classes in an inviting new dance center that makes inspired use of a luminous little second-floor studio-theater in the handsome 105-year-old settlement house.    The solos were created by Sara Rudner, an eloquent early Twyla Tharp dancer who now teaches, choreographs and very occasionally performs. Each was inspired by the woman who danced it. Throughout, in mostly continuous soft, looping motion, there was a sense of individual personality, movement quality and contrast among the women. None of the solos would probably stand on their own, but as a quick-flowing suite of pieces, danced without musical accompaniment, they were a kind of exquisite gift, a chance to savor eight distinctive and very good performers.

Because of high rents, the last remaining alleys in this borough have gone under, and what remains, Bowlmor Lanes, is in the heart of Greenwich Village. Teddy Bourins, an owner, said this alley should continue to stay here for at least 10 more years. With 40,000 square feet and 44 lanes on 2 floors, Bowlmor does seem to meet Manhattanites' bowling demands. And what better way is there to burn off the children's Saturday-morning hyperactive energy on damp winter days? Serving New Yorkers from this very building since 1938, the center charges each person $2.75 a game, and 75 cents for shoe rentals. And though the decor may not have changed too much in the last five decades (smoking, however, is no longer allowed near the lanes), who can complain? Saturday and Sunday hours for children 8 and up (because of insurance constraints, no one younger than 8 is permitted to bowl, even if accompanied by an adult) are 10 A.M. to 7 P.M., with peak times on Saturday after 2 P.M. Sunday is usually less busy. No children are allowed to bowl after 7 P.M. Two Workshops Brooklyn Museum 200 Eastern Parkway, at Washington Avenue Crown Heights Section (718) 638-5000 Recommended ages: 4 to 7","excerpt":"8 to 12 Saturdays and Sundays    For the casual visitor with children who happens to go through the Brooklyn Museum, two informal workshops, \\"Arty Facts\\" for those 4 to 7 years old and \\"What's Up\\" for those 8 to 12, are offered free of charge, provided the accompanying adults pay a museum admission fee. \\"Arty Facts\\" meets in the Grand Lobby, first floor, at 11 A.M. on both weekend days. The workshop is led by a museum instructor, and the theme tomorrow and Sunday is waterworks: how water is used as a subject in artwork and how it's used as a material, as in watercolors. During the hour-and-a-half program, parents and children will be treated first to a tour of the American-paintings and contemporary-art galleries, then head on to the education department, where everyone will create their own seascapes: and you won't use just blue. \\"What's Up\\" also meets both days in the Grand Lobby, at 2 P.M., where children (parents are not encouraged to come), led by an instructor, will also be taken on an hourlong tour through the same galleries, with the focus on looking at and talking about the paintings, and involving some participatory sketching. All art materials are furnished by the museum. Suggested admission to the museum is $4 for adults, $2 for students and free to members and children under 12, accompanied by an adult. Berlin Wall East 53d Street (between Fifth and Madison Avenues) Manhattan Recommended ages: 5 and up    If you find yourselves in mid-Manhattan this weekend, take the children to East 53d Street to see a large chunk of history. At a total of 12.5 tons, these 5 sections of the Berlin wall attest to the artistic spirit that expresses itself under even repressive living conditions. The paintings of the stark human faces and the vivid graffiti are counterpoints to the mysterious date, 3-5-89, marked across one swollen egg-shaped head. Purchased from the former East German Government by Jerry Speyer of Tishman Speyer Properties, the owner of the 520 Madison Avenue office building, the sections, 12 feet high and stretching 20 feet long, were shipped across the Atlantic Ocean and recently assembled as a permanent work in the company's art collection. As a brass plaque nearby states, the artists are unknown. Children's Videos Museum of Broadcasting 1 East 53d Street Manhattan (212) 752-4690 Recommended ages: 4 to 10 Tomorrow    As part of \\"Storybook Playhouse\\" at the Museum of Broadcasting, video presentations of classic children's books -- tomorrow's being \\"Ramona's Bad Day,\\" \\"The Fisherman and His Wife\\" and \\"Feelings\\" -- are shown not only to introduce youngsters to stories, but also to present programs no longer on television. The shows run a total of about an hour and a half. In Beverly Cleary's \\"Ramona's Bad Day,\\" actors depict Ramona's very crummy day, when she is forced to eat a pot roast sandwich and act like a dog. \\"The Fisherman and His Wife,\\" a Grimm fable, is handsomely articulated with illustrations by Diana Bryan that resemble woodcuts, and narrated by Jodie Foster. The simple but rather profound fable features an avaricious wife and an ending you just won't expect. \\"Feelings\\" is based on the book by Aliki, and explores -- through actors, animation and other children's books -- how confused emotions can be much simpler to understand than you think. You'll even see that a gorilla can get depressed. The videos are shown in the museum's Videotheque 2 theater, which is carpeted in case you want to sit on the floor. Strollers can be taken into the theater. The screenings are shown at 12:30 and 3:30 P.M. The museum would like those attending the screenings to pay the suggested admission fee of $4.50 for adults, $3.50 for students and $2.50 for children under 13. African Sculpture Center for African Art 54 East 68th Street Manhattan (212) 861-1200 Recommended ages: 5 and up Through March 24    A quiet slice of Africa thrives on the Upper East Side in this handsome brownstone museum, which welcomes families at all times. The setting is as inviting as the current show's expressive sculptures. As an accompanying catalogue explains, these African figures, drawn from two private collections, and made of wood, terra cotta and other natural materials, were not all meant to be displayed. Some were made to be worn as masks or carried. But all of them should give children a sense of how relevant to everyday life African art can be. For example, the Malian \\"Mother With Many Children\\" sculpture, with its chin-jutting mother and her four crawling-all-over-her-children, might give young viewers a better understanding of what it's like to be a mother sometimes, no matter where you live. Suggested admission fees are $2.50 for adults and $1.50 for children. Strollers can be checked in the coatroom; there is no elevator. Hours are Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 5 P.M., and Sundays, noon to 5 P.M. For Children"},{"year":"1953","title":"Stanley E.

Directed by Perry Ogden  6 p.m. today, Walter Reade Theater","excerpt":"8:30 p.m. Friday, Museum of Modern Art       For this fiction film about Irish travelers, the British photographer Perry Ogden weds the visual and rhetorical strategies of the observational documentary to the flimsiest of narrative conceits. With a hand-held digital camera and the cooperation of a real traveler family, the first-time filmmaker paints a grim, doggedly unromantic portrait of a people under siege, both external and internal: young Winnie, her boozer mother and untold number of siblings live in third-world squalor in a single cramped trailer. They yearn for a better life but are supremely ill equipped to achieve it. The children draw the family's drinking water from a roadside spigot and dig through a goodwill bin for clothes; every so often the law comes knocking, as does a social-services worker offering generally useless advice. Mr. Ogden makes the case that the larger world wants nothing to do with these nomadic outsiders, but intentionally or not, he also makes the case that the reverse is equally true.

It soon emerges that the two are strangers who, having just met at a party, have retreated to a motel for some zipless entertainment. In between the orchestrated ohs and ahs and regularly timed cigarette breaks, the woman (Blanca Lewin) and man (Gonzalo Valenzuela) discreetly show off their pretty bodies, pleasure each other like practiced lovers (or porn stars) and slowly bare their uninteresting souls. The director Matías Bize clearly means for this soft-core encounter to open into something more substantial and not long after Round 1, alas, the newly acquainted bedmates start sounding and behaving a lot like a couple. The idea that strangers can engage in sex for pleasure without guilt, anguish and veritable laundry lists of complaints remains out of bounds, which gives this Chilean-German co-production a curiously old-fashioned, decidedly unsexy vibe.

At the time of Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1492, Cuba was home to Arawak, Ciboney, and Guanahatabey Indian people. Cuba served as a launching point for Spanish conquests in the Americas, and the early- 19th-century wars of independence that swept the rest of Spanish America did not overthrow the imposing Spanish garrison there. Slavery was abolished in 1886, but Spanish colonialism lingered until the 1890's. Spanish control of the island began to deteriorate in the late 1860's with the beginning of the “Ten Years War” (1868–78). Under the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Cuban-U.S.-Spanish War, Cuba became a U.S. protectorate. The U.S.-sponsored Platt Amendment (1901) to the new Cuban constitution gave the United States the right to intervene in Cuban affairs. Corruption and political repression plagued Cuban politics during the first half of the 20th century. Gerardo Machado won election to the presidency in 1925, but quickly turned his administration into a dictatorship that lasted until his ouster by a progressive coalition of students and labor in 1933. The “revolution” of 1933 installed Ramón Grau San Martín as the new head of the government, but the U.S. supported Grau's ouster, and army sergeant Fulgencio Batista replaced him. Batista ruled the country either directly or indirectly for the next quarter century. In 1953 Fidel Castro Ruz led a failed attack on the Moncada army barracks in Santiago. In Dec. 1956 Fidel and Raúl Castro, Argentine physician Ernesto “Che” Guevara, and 79 others returned to Cuba and waged a guerrilla campaign against the government. Batista's military failed to defeat the guerrillas, and in the wake of increasing demonstrations of public antipathy for his government, the dictator fled the country. The Communist Fidelistas took control Jan. 1, 1959. By mid-1959, revolutionary tribunals had tried and executed more than 500 political “enemies.” The leaders announced an agrarian reform, and by 1960 the nationalization of the economy was in full swing. In 1961 U.S.-Cuban diplomatic relations were severed, and the U.S.-sponsored Bay of Pigs invasion by Cuban exiles failed. In 1962 the Cuban missile crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear war when U.S. spy planes uncovered Soviet intentions to place nuclear weapons on the island. The Soviets agreed to the withdrawal of missiles in exchange for a U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba. In its active foreign policy, Cuba provided assistance to a number of left-wing regimes in Africa and Latin America, most notably its military presence in Angola from 1975 to 1991. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Cuba lost huge subsidies, forcing its economy into a downward spiral. In 1994, the worsening economy and a growing dissatisfaction with the Castro govenment fueled migration of Cubans to U.S. shores. With thousands of refugees arriving in Florida each day—aboard boats, homemade rafts, ferries—the U.S. and Cuba negotiated an agreement in which the United States would increase annual acceptance levels of Cuban immigrants to 20,000 in return for Cuba's promise to curb illegal migration. Tensions flared between the U.S. and Cuba on Feb. 24, 1996, when Cuban MiGs shot down two private jets operating out of Miami. The U.S. responded by tightening economic sanctions, with penalties for foreigners investing in Cuba. Castro called for a renewed commitment to Marxism and met with Pope John Paul II who visited Cuba in 1999 and publicly confronted Castro on issues of freedom and religious liberty. But the regime remains changeless. In January 2003 “elections,” 609 candidates ran unopposed for 609 National Assembly seats. In March, 78 dissidents and independent journalists were arrested; in April all 78 were found guilty in closed trials and given sentences of 6 to 28 years.
