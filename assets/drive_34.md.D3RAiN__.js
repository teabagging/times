Princeton's director of admissions proposes to persuade more women to matriculate by preparing brochures that stress his school's strong programs in the humanities, which he evidently considers a traditional ''women's'' subject, and he concedes that Princeton's acknowledged strengths in subjects ''that traditionally draw men in disproportionate numbers'' like physics, mathematics, astrophysics and engineering do not attract women students.   But Princeton's problem - and its misperception of how to solve it - reveals why so much admissions advertising from our finest schools discourages women from matriculating there. The attempt to persuade women high-school seniors that their best career choices are in the humanities not only threatens to turn those disciplines into female ghettoes, but it also ignores the growing numbers of women undergraduates who are turning to careers in the sciences and engineering.

This smug lamentation is interrupted by the arrival of two women, one of whom (Deborah Laufer) happens to have had a long, disastrous affair with Mr. Lutes. What follows this accidental encounter in Theresa Rebeck's \\"Big Mistake\\" is an abrasive and humorous look at a sexist battleground.   The dialogue in this one-act play (by the author of \\"Spike Heels\\") has the rudeness of David Mamet but with a decidedly feminist sound. Ms. Rebeck's comedy, the first of five short plays written by women in an anthology entitled \\"I'm Sorry . . . Was That Your World?,\\" is rough on the male characters while not forgetting that the women also bear responsibility. Ms. Laufer's character seems to have a serious case of masochism, and her friend (Kathryn Langwell) is burdened with a heavy career chip on her shoulder. One comes out of this play feeling a certain sympathy for the quietly efficient bartender (Jessica Hecht) who has to put up with conversations like this every night.

As anyone knows who periodically has a good denial-driven laugh at how much should be set aside for retirement -- to make up for all those profligate years of paying rent, clothing the kids and buying food with stagnating wages -- pensions are a trouble spot.    It may not seem so on the surface. Women working full time are more likely than ever before to have pension coverage, according to a survey released on Thursday by the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, a Labor Department agency. The percentage of women in full-time, private-sector jobs with pension coverage grew to 48 percent last year from 38 percent in 1972. Coverage for men in the same category and period seesawed, ending at 51 percent in 1993, down 4 percentage points from the peak year of 1979.

However, even those who immediately recognize this disturbing transformation of the familiar as a quintessential Surrealist statement may not know that it was made by a woman, or that she was only one of several female artists active in the movement almost from its inception.\\n\\nSurveys of Surrealism have tended to play down women's esthetic contributions, usually casting them in the role of the Freudian muse whose erotic and generative energies fueled the creative fires of the male vanguard. ''Women Artists of the Surrealist Movement,'' the current exhibition at the Fine Arts Center Gallery of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, attempts to redress this imbalance by focusing on the achievements of Surrealism's distaff side. It includes works by 16 painters and collagists, some well known and others obscure, who deserve wider recognition for their important contributions, if not to the formulation of Surrealist doctrine then certainly to its translation into visual form.
