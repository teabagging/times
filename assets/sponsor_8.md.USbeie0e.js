The occasion is a benefit to help pay for a statue of Joseph Cinque, leader of the Amistad revolt in the mid-1800's. The statue, to stand in front of City Hall facing the New Haven Green, commemorates the experiences of a group of kidnapped Africans aboard a Portuguese slave ship. En route to America they rose up against their captors, and after a trial in United States courts they were freed and sent home.    In \\"Paul Robeson,\\" Mr. Brooks, who is best known for his work as Hawk on the television series \\"Spencer for Hire,\\" is alone on stage except for an accompanist. The author, Philip Hayes Dean, has written a dramatic biography rather than a play, providing for the exposition of Robeson's talents as singer, actor, athlete, intellectual and political activist.    Curtain times are 8 P.M. on Saturday and 2 P.M. next Sunday at the Shubert Theater on College Street. Ticket prices are $12.50, $22.50, $32.50 and $50. The box office phone number is 562-5666. VICTORIANA AT MYSTIC     A group of distinguished horticultural experts will lecture at Mystic Seaport during the museum's ninth annual Victorian Yankee program scheduled from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. on Saturday at the Seamen's Inne. Each year some aspect of Victorian life is explored in the series, and this year's theme is \\"Unearthing the Victorian Garden.\\"    One of the speakers is Rudy Favretti, the landscape architect for Monticello, Old Salem, Strawbery Banke and Old Sturbridge Village. Mr. Favretti, the author of several books on gardens, noted that the Victorian era was a golden age for horticulture, when exotic plants, flowers and shrubs sprang up in suburban gardens, and greenhouses, which had been unknown a few decades earlier, became almost common. As society turned from agriculture to industry, gardening became a pastime.    Other speakers are James Buckler, founder of the office of horticulture at the Smithsonian Institution","excerpt":"Virginia Chisolm, consultant for Celia Thaxter's Garden at Appledore Island, Isle of Shoals; Lucinda Brockway, former landscape director at Strawbery Banke in Portsmouth, N.H., and Nancy Spinner, Mystic Seaport horticulturist.   Tickets cost $42 and include morning coffee and pastry as well as lunch. For reservations and more information call 572-0711, extension 323. ARTISTRY IN WOOD     Tommy Thomas's wood constructions draw from a tradition that has evolved in this century: artists take bits of this and pieces of that and build them into something that is acknowledged to be art. Unlike much of the genre, her work is representational, cheerful, colorful and sometimes funny.   She collects much of her material from construction sites, condemned houses, beaches and marinas near her home on Long Island. She glues the bits together, finishes them with airplane paint, nail polish and markers, and a little country shed or a seven-foot Art Deco apartment house emerges. Tiny diners, movie houses, churches, even whole neighborhoods, some of them as familiar as Central Park West, are reproduced out of the unlikeliest detritis, to perfect scale.   The exhibition is on view at the Northridge Gallery, 418 Main Street in Ridgefield, through March 24. Gallery hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday and noon to 5 P.M. on Sunday. The phone number is 438-1485. SCORES AND SOUNDTRACKS     Bill Conti is the guest conductor and the composer of most of the music to be played by the New Haven Symphony Orchestra on Saturday at 8 P.M. in the Palace Theater. The program, \\"A Night at the Movies,\\" includes excerpts from scores of other composers for movies and television, including Burt Bacharach and John Williams.    Mr. Conti will present his own works, including the Oscar-winning theme from \\"The Right Stuff\\"; movie music from \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" \\"Flashdance,\\" \\"Chariots of Fire\\" and the four \\"Rocky\\" films, as well as his themes from the television shows \\"Dynasty,\\" \\"Cagney and Lacey\\" and \\"Falcon Crest.\\"     In 1990, Mr. Conti won two Emmy awards for his concept and score for the television showing of the New York City Marathon. He conducted the Juilliard Symphony Orchestra at Lincoln Center during a live simulcast of the race.    Tickets for Saturday's concert, priced at $20, $24 and $28, may be reserved by calling 776-1444. CHILDREN'S FARE     The stories of Shel Silverstein have been adapted by the Peanut Butter Touring Theater of Westport into a children's entertainment called \\"Apples and Kisses and Shoes.\\" It will be performed Saturday at 11 A.M. at the Old Academy Nursery School, Route 136 and Center Road in Easton.    The hourlong show, which is recommended for preschool- and elementary school-age children, includes segments about a boy who turns into a television set and a girl who refuses to take out the garbage.    Tickets at $2.75 will be sold only at the door beginning at 10:30 A.M., and seating is limited to 175 people. For more information call 452-1373. 9 HOURS OF MOZART     The Greenwich Choral Society will give its annual concert in Theater C of the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York in Purchase on Saturday, but with a decidedly different twist. Calling it a Mozart Marathon in honor of the composer's bicentennial, the event begins at noon with a lecture by Richard Westenburg, accompanied by soloists, and ends with the Choral Society's performance of the Requiem at 9 P.M.    In between, there will be a song recital at 1:30, a 3 P.M. concert of orchestral works with piano and violin solos, and the choral society performing the Coronation Mass. Organ music and string quartets are scheduled at 4:30, and a concert begining at 6 features music for the church and excerpts from \\"The Magic Flute,\\" \\"Idomeneo\\" and \\"The Marriage of Figaro.\\" Four-handed piano works and a piano trio will be heard from 7:30 to 8:20.    Richard Vogt will conduct the major concerts, and among more than a dozen soloists are Beverly Myers, soprano; Stephan Kirchgraber, bass; Paul Fleckenstein, organist; Dwight Oarr, pianist; Dorothy Happel, violinist, and Daniel Miller, cellist.    Throughout the day, a variety of Viennese pastries, hot and cold food, beverages and wine (after 5 P.M.) will be available in the lobby. There will also be a selection of Mozart memorabilia for sale. Tickets for the entire day cost $37.50, tickets for individual recitals and concerts range from $2 to $15. For reservations and more information, call 622-5136.

The Vols took charge on their second possession of the third quarter, running 7:44 off the clock during a 68-yard march. Kelly completed two passes to start the drive before Thompson took over, moving the Vols to the Mississippi 3-yard line on runs of 8 and 5 yards.

In a kind of epistolary eucharist, they have laid hands on the lifeless graphs and inert numbers often used to describe the American economy and have transformed them into a song of hope. In their ''Pastoral Letter on Catholic Social Teaching and the U.S. Economy,'' they beckon entrepreneurs, government officials, labor leaders and ordinary citizens toward a wider and more humane view of what an economy, guided by the values of dignity and participation, can and should do. \\n\\nThe bishops wholeheartedly salute the prodigious achievements of the American economy, but at the same time raise some troubling questions about how the engine is being used, or misused.

It's no wonder that the 70's seemed a bit quiet in comparison, or that the livelier 80's were constantly measured against their glittering grandparent.   The heady atmosphere of the 1960's is captured in an unusual exhibition at the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, L.I., one of the best shows held at this institution. Spread throughout three of the museum's galleries, the show includes 39 artworks, paintings, drawings and sculptures that range from the proto-Pop efforts of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg to the sly Conceptual sorties of Joseph Kosuth and John Baldessari. Together, they offer a fast-moving outline of the 60's that is unusually high in quality. This may be because the art on display belongs to two of the era's most eminent art dealers. The exhibition, which has been organized by the art historian Sam Hunter, is titled \\"A View From the 60's: Selections From the Leo Castelli Collection and the Michael and Ileana Sonnabend Collection.\\" Review/Art","excerpt":"Vision of the 60's, From 2 Dealers Who Shaped It"},{"year":"1960","title":"In delineating yesterday an ideal for the Coming Church, the president of the American Unitarian Association quoted the Rev.
