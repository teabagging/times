Olympics Notebook","excerpt":"BIATHELETE, 39, TO CARRY AMERICAN FLAG"},{"year":"1992","title":"HOW IT'S DONE: This sport combines two functions of a mountain soldier: cross-country skiing and shooting. What makes it difficullt is the contrast in demands. When the biathlete is skiing, he must move quickly. Then he must stop and remain steady as he shoots.\\n\\nFor the first time, women will compete in Olympic biathlon. They will have two individual races (7.5 and 15 kilometers) and a relay, the men two individual races (10 and 20 kilometers) and a relay.\\n\\nThe Olympic course has two basic tracks 2 1/2 miles around. All shooting is done from a rifle range near the spectator stands so everyone can watch. The skiing method is freestyle, which means the biathletes can move the way speed skaters do rather than use the slower style of keeping the skis parallel.\\nHOW IT'S SCORED: In each race, there are two to four shooting stops, half prone and half standing. At each stop, the biathlete loads a .22-caliber rifle and takes five shots from 50 meters. Then he races, stops and shoots again.\\n\\nThe targets are only 1.7 inches in diameter for prone and 4.3 inches for standing. The targets swivel automatically when hit, so everyone knows the results immediately. In the longer individual races, one minute is added to the race time for each missed shot. In the shorter races and the relays, the biathlete must ski a 150-meter penalty circuit for each miss. The fastest adjusted race time wins.\\nWHAT TO LOOK FOR: Watch the biathlete race to the shooting station, quickly load the rifle, then try to freeze before shooting. If he does not rush, he will probably be steadier and thus shoot more accurately. But if he does not rush, he will lose time, so the goal is to find a middle ground. Ever tried to rush slowly?\\n\\nThe best biathletes are cross-country skiers who learn to shoot. Eventually, all shoot fairly well and, at this level of competition, many do not miss a shot. Anyone who misses more than one shot is unlikely to finish high.\\nWHO TO WATCH: The favorites include Mark Kirchner of Germany and Eirik Kvalfoss of Norway among the men and Grete Ingeborg Nykkelmo of Norway and Petra Schaacf of Germany among the women. All have won world or Olympic titles.\\n\\nAnna Sonnerup of Hanover, N.H., a World Cup silver medalist, would have been a women's favorite, except that she finished eighth in the United States trials. The first seven made the team.\\n\\nJosh Thompson of Gunnison, Colo., the best American biathlete ever, has done well on this winter's World Cup circuit. On a good day, he could win a medal, but he must beat biathletes from Norway, Germany, France and the United Team.

To begin with, both Netanyahu and Zyuganov head ideological parties that have been out of power since the early 1990's, and during their absence their respective countries have gone through sweeping revolutions. Since the Communists last ruled, the Soviet Union has collapsed and its authoritarian, central planning regime replaced with a flawed, but free-market democracy.

But before you came in here today you met with my sworn political enemies [the Christian far right] who have put out tapes accusing me of having people murdered. So, Prime Minister, we're even.''    The two pols then had a laugh over their mutual attempts to stick it to each other, and it broke the ice. More important, Mr. Clinton followed it up with the first concrete U.S. blueprint for breaking the Mideast deadlock. It was probably Mr. Clinton's last laugh, though, because the latest sordid White House scandal hit a few hours later. By week's end, when Yasir Arafat arrived, that all-too-rare, blunt, put-your-cards-on-the-table approach to foreign policy evinced by the President earlier in the week seemed to peter out.

WILLIAMS'S ''Cherries and Cherry Pits'' is something quite unusual for a children's book: the portrait of an artist. The artist, a little girl named Bidemmi, left-handed, with pigtails and big appraising eyes, is herself a portraitist. She makes visual notes for her work on the subway. There is, for example, a man with a thick neck and big strong muscles who has a ''fat wrinkle'' on his forehead. He could probably ''carry a piano on his head,'' yet his only burden is a small white bag. Bidemmi surmises that this bag contains cherries, and that he is bringing them home to his four children, whose names all begin with the letter ''D'' ('' 'Dee Dee, Dennis, Duane, Dorrie,' he calls'').

After all it had only shown it to a handful of its own members and a few newspaper men, persons who presumably knew all that it was supposed to teach. So it approached the Paramount authorities and asked for a showing, with audience reaction cards to tell the tale.Paramount agreed, put it on in New York and scheduled it for Phoenix, Tucson, San Francisco, Salt Lake, Buffalo and Des Moines. Agreement was the readier because the short contains no selling message. It is almost purely educational.The only noticeable propaganda lines are an emphasis on the implied statement that the Stock Exchange is pretty careful about what stocks it admits to listing and a caution to the viewer to be careful about his investments.Out of 146 audience-reaction cards returned only six bore negative votes. These seemed to come from persons who didn't like capitalistic machinery or from those who resented having what they termed propaganda thrown at them in the middle of a program of entertainment. \\"Propaganda,\\" said one.\\"When I go to a movie,\\" said another, \\"I go to be entertained, not to see an ad for soap, coke, cigars or Wall Street.\\"\\"I think this sort of thing is too commercial,\\" said a Flushing man, \\"I want to be able to choose what I see, and not have it foisted on me unsuspectingly.\\"\\"Gives a very wrong impression to the average viewer,\\" said a fourth.A Brooklynite came up with the following mixed verdict, a kind of one-man hung jury: \\"I think that it was a good bit of propaganda because the American public is not buying stock. They have wised up.\\"In reply to the criticism that the film should not be \\"foisted\\" on the unsuspecting, Stock Exchange officials explain that showings in commercial houses have never been part of their plan. The Paramount experiment is simply a test.Almost all the reactions, however, were enthusiastically favorable. Dozens of audience members asked for \\"more of the same,\\" some even suggesting subjects to be covered, such as \\"why strikes happen between labor and management. Also tell about bonds and preferred stocks, how market prices go down, as well as up.\\" Another wrote: \\"What happened to preferred stock and special bond issues? Let's have the whole story the next time.\\"But this one, counted on the plus side, came from a Manhattan man: \\"My honest impression was that it had a cunning type of humor. You forgot the loopholes: nevertheless, it serves its purpose, whatever it may be. Good.\\"Perhaps the most wholehearted and unexpected praise came from a Brooklyn woman. \\"Very good,\\" she wrote. \\"Best one out of all three.\\" The other two films of the bill that night were the feature pictures, \\"Bend of the River\\" and \\"Macao.\\"Here are some other favorable replies:\\"Very, very explanative. Even a moron could understand it. (P. S. I'm not a moron.\\"\\"Very educational. It smartens the people not to invest in phony stocks.\\"\\"Very good. More pictures of this type should be shown to help the public to invest money in a more reliable way.\\"\\"I've always wondered as to the 'goings on' of the Stock Exchange. This amusing short has done a great deal for me in a better understanding of the working of money.\\"More than once Stock Exchange officials have emphasized that their new film doesn't try to sell anything. The responses found one Toledo, Ohio, man well sold on the film but not on the stock market: \\"I found it very interesting,\\" he wrote. \\"Quite clear and simple, but I still wouldn't invest in other than United States bonds!\\" Stock Exchange Film 'What Makes Us Tick' Is Well Received in Theatre Preview Here","excerpt":"BIG BOARD'S MOVIE IS WELL RECEIVED"},{"year":"1967","title":"One of the knottiest problems likely to be faced by Robert W.

This competition was evident earlier this week when the New York Stock Exchange entered the stock index fray by offering one of the richest creations to come along in a while, a so-called Beta Index option.   It may sound like a new kind of high-tech radio, but the name comes from a concept out of modern portfolio theory, known as beta, that is used by professional stock fund managers to fine-tune the risk in their portfolios.
