As chairman of the House Budget Committee task force on defense, foreign policy and space, I held a hearing last week on the budgetary consequences of \\"big science\\" projects like the space station and the superconducting supercollider. The hearing made it clear that financing these projects may very well come at the expense of other compelling science needs that provide a far stronger contribution to the maintenance of America's scientific base and our international economic competitiveness.   Under President Bush's budget proposal, spending on large research and development projects increased by 29 percent over fiscal year 1991 levels, and would consume an increasing share of the domestic discretionary spending during the first half of the 1990's.   The President's proposed increases for the space station and supercollider represent 50 percent of all his proposed increases for domestic discretionary spending in fiscal year 1994. If we include NASA's earth-observing system, these three largest projects represent 90 percent of the President's request for domestic discretionary spending growth in fiscal year 1994. These increases stand in sharp contrast to the $3.6 billion in Federal spending reductions in fiscal year 1994 that were imposed by last year's budget agreement.   My task force will hold another hearing to examine our investment in \\"small science\\" projects and the contributions which basic and applied research make to United States competitiveness and the maintenance of America's scientific base. In these times of severe budgetary constraints, Congress must invest scarce Federal research and development dollars wisely and in a way that will insure that the United States gets the greatest possible return for these dollars.

The study demonstrates that upon quitting, a smoker's weight returns to the level of a subject who has never smoked because of the artificial and temporary weight loss induced by smoking. Because subjects were followed for a long period and age-related weight gain was evidenced, the gains following cessation were artificially inflated. Women gained more than men because smoking first depressed their weight more than men. Also, the vast majority of subjects gained trivial amounts of weight.   Weight control is one of the most important reasons girls begin smoking and the biggest deterrent preventing women from quitting. Advertisements for women's cigarette brands are filled with slender women who smoke light, long, thin, slim or superslim cigarettes. The underlying message is clear: smoke and be thin.   A survey of high school seniors sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse documents that high school senior girls have smoked at higher rates than high school senior boys since 1977.

Five theaters -- the Rond Point Theatre Renaud-Barrault, MC 93 Bobigny, the Odeon-Theatre de l'Europe, Nanterre-Amandiers and the Conservatoire National Superieur d'Art Dramatique -- have turned themselves over to Russians: to Russian companies or French troupes directed by Russians or French troupes with their regular directors doing Russian works.   The links between France and Russia go back a long way. French was the language of the Russian aristocracy in the 18th and 19th centuries. There was a wave of upper-crust Russian immigration to Paris after the Russian Revolution.

Pro-Government troops appeared to have restored order in Kinshasa, but by all accounts the situation in the interior was far more confused.   A1    NATO Approves Kosovo Plan  The United States said NATO had approved plans for the use of force in Kosovo, where Serbian forces are carrying out an offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists. The announcement was intended to push Serbia to end the attacks. But no NATO official would discuss what actions in particular would prompt a response.   A3    Fears grew about the fate of the tens of thousands of refugees in Kosovo who have been fleeing the Serbian attacks. Long columns of terrified civilians emerged from combat zones, where foreign monitors say homes are being burned and tens of thousands have been displaced.   A3    Exile Says He Misled Times  A Cuban exile who conducted violent operations against the Cuban Government has asserted that he deliberately misinformed The New York Times when he said in a series of interviews that leaders of the most influential exile organization in the United States, the Cuban-American National Foundation, had provided him with financial support.   A7    Leftists Challenge Results  A day after elections in the southern state of Oaxaca, Mexico, the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution challenged preliminary returns that showed its candidate for governor had come in second, saying the balloting was marred by fraud.   A8    U.N.-Iraq Talks Breakdown  Crucial talks in Baghdad on the remaining issues blocking the lifting of sanctions on Iraq collapsed in rancor, United Nations officials said. The Iraqis rejected a plan proposed by the United Nations chief arms inspector for Iraq, Richard Butler, saying he was using ''old tricks.''   A6    Israel to Release Palestinians  Israel was reported to be preparing to free dozens of Palestinian prisoners whose release had been urged by Palestinian negotiators, apparently in an effort to rescue imperiled peace talks.   A7    Muslims Attack in India  Indian officials said Muslim rebels contesting Indian rule in Kashmir had crossed into a neighboring Indian state and shot to death 34 workers sleeping in two remote construction camps.   A6    U.S. Remains Top Arms Dealer  The United States remains the world's biggest arms merchant, filling the developing world's arsenals with billions of dollars of weapons, but Russia and France are poised to overtake the United States, a new Government report says.   A5    NATIONAL   A9-11    Calls for Clinton To Confess Are Rebuffed  White House officials said President Clinton, who is to testify on Aug. 17, would continue to say that he had no sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky and was appealing a court decision ordering a top aide, Bruce R. Lindsey, to testify in the case. Several Clinton aides dismissed pleas from Republicans and some former officials that Mr. Clinton acknowledge an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, to blunt or even end the inquiry by the Whitewater independent counsel.   A1    House Endorses Campaign Bill  A House majority that included 51 Republicans defied the G.O.P. leadership and endorsed a bipartisan measure to overhaul the way the nation's political campaigns are financed, by effectively banning unlimited, unregulated donations to political parties. The 237-to-186 vote made it likely that the measure would prevail against several competing proposals.   A1    Plan to Expand Medicaid  President Clinton will announce new policies today making it easier for states to provide Medicaid to adults in two-parent families who work at low-wage jobs for more than 100 hours a month. Officials said the changes would help 135,000 to 200,000 people in 20 states.   A11    Baby Mix-Up Takes Grim Turn  The recent discovery that two baby girls were switched at a hospital maternity ward three years ago took a grim and even more complicated turn with the disclosure that the presumed parents of one baby died on July 4 in a car wreck.   A9    MCI Agrees to a Refund  An agreement between MCI Communications and the F.C.C. will provide credits to customers who used MCI's discounted ''dialaround'' service, known as 10-10-321, but who got billed at the company's highest rate. The 10-10-321 service is operated through TelecomUSA, an MCI subsidiary. The credits will be provided regardless of whether a person noticed the mistake or complained, the agency said. The commission did not estimate how much money was at stake. Under the agreement, MCI will work with Bell Atlantic to identify which customers were affected, the commission said. A glitch in new switching equipment was blamed for the errors.   (Associated Press)    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Remodeled Sex Business Gets Reprieve From Judge  A judge in Manhattan blocked the city's plan to close the sex emporium Show World, saying renovations that its management recently undertook had sufficiently complicated the matter of its compliance with the city's new sex-shop zoning law to require a hearing on Thursday.   A1    Slain Officer Is Mourned  Dignitaries, friends and relatives gathered at the First Central Baptist Church on Staten Island for the funeral of Police Officer Gerard Carter, who died of his wounds on Friday.   B1    Apollo Contract Inquiry  The private foundation that controls the financially troubled Apollo Theater decided that a company owned by Percy E. Sutton could retain the syndication rights to a television show broadcast from the Harlem landmark. But another company complained that Mr. Sutton's company changed its bid at the last minute, and the State Attorney General's office said it would subpoena records of the contract meeting.   B1    A Theater's Revival  The officials behind Times Square's redevelopment have agreed to lease 42d Street's last unclaimed historic theater, the Times Square Theater, to Livent, the Canadian company that produces ''Ragtime,'' rejecting a bid for a theme restaurant run by the World Wrestling Federation.

Augusto Pinochet, 85, is mentally unfit to stand trial on charges that he covered up the killings of political opponents by a death squad shortly after he seized power in Chile in 1973. Human rights lawyers plan to appeal.   A1    Colombian Rebels Criticized  Human Rights Watch said the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the largest rebel group, regularly violated noncombatants' rights by attacking civilians, kidnapping for ransom and recruiting children.   A4    Mexico Pressed on Torture  Amnesty International, in a report to be published today, will urge President Vicente Fox to fulfill his promises to end the use of torture and the concocting of confessions by the police, and it will ask him to review cases it cites as prominent victims of trumped-up political charges.   A4    Japan Firm on Textbooks  The government said it would order no further revisions of textbooks that many critics say whitewash Japan's record of imperial-era atrocities in East Asia. There were immediate protests in China and South Korea.   A3    Indonesian Leader's Threat  President Abdurrahman Wahid said he would declare a state of emergency and call new elections unless Parliament dropped plans to begin proceedings to remove him from office.   A8    Palestinian Homes Destroyed  Israeli crews demolished 14 homes at the edge of a Palestinian refugee camp in East Jerusalem. Mayor Ehud Olmert said the structures had been built without permits.   A8    U.S. Rebuff on Small-Arms Pact  The Bush administration warned that it would not join a pact to curtail the international flow of illegal small arms if it infringed on the American right to own guns.   A8    World Briefing   A6    NATIONAL   A10-16    Pentagon to Seek Funds To Test Missile Defense  The Pentagon is preparing to ask Congress for money to build a missile defense test site in Alaska that could also become the command center for a working antimissile system as early as 2004, military officials said. If it became operational, the site would violate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.   A1    Caution on Soft-Money Bill  Sponsors of legislation to rewrite campaign finance laws said they were uncertain that they could hold together a House coalition to pass a ban on unlimited, unregulated political donations. Debate begins today.   A1    Bush Appeal on Patients' Bill  President Bush urged Congress to pass a patients' rights bill that addressed his concern for limiting lawsuits, portraying himself as a proponent of -- not an obstacle to -- legislation most Americans support.   A14    California Power Talks Fail  A federal mediator ended two weeks of negotiations about California's demands for electricity refunds, with the state and power suppliers seemingly no closer to a settlement than when the talks began. The talks' failure shifts the burden of resolving the yearlong dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.   A14    Urban Economic Engines  The vast majority of jobs and economic wealth created in the United States in the past decade were generated within metropolitan areas, an analysis for the nation's mayors shows. Were the New York metropolitan area a country, its $437.8 billion economy would rank 14th in the world, just behind South Korea, but ahead of Australia and Taiwan.   A10    Hearing for Ex-Klansman  A judge in Birmingham, Ala., confronted with conflicting psychiatric evaluations, began hearing evidence on whether Bobby Frank Cherry, 71, a former Ku Klux Klansman, is competent to stand trial as the final defendant in the 1963 church bombing that killed four black girls.   A14    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Staten Island Power Plant Can Operate, Judge Rules  A state judge in Staten Island refused to halt operation of a new minipower plant in the borough, ensuring that the generator and nine others central to a Pataki administration plan to avoid summer blackouts in New York City would be used, at least for now. A state appeals court is still to rule on whether the New York Power Authority skirted its own requirements in building the plants.   B1    Medical License Regained  Dr. Steven J. Bier, the owner of a Bronx radiology clinic who was accused of failing to diagnose breast cancer because of faulty tests, regained his license in a settlement of state charges, but he must undergo retraining before practicing mammography again. Retesting has found cancer in 25 of his patients.   B3    ARTS   E1-10    SCIENCE TIMES   F1-12    Genome Effort Gets a Customer  Celera Genomics said it had signed an agreement with the National Cancer Institute that would give the institute's researchers access to Celera's genome database. The institute is part of the publicly financed consortium that is Celera's rival in the race to decode the human genome.   A13    Health & Fitness   F7    FASHION   B7    OBITUARIES   A17    SPORTS   D1-8    Ivanisevic Prevails  Goran Ivanisevic, the wild-card entry from Croatia, beat Patrick Rafter of Australia, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 2-6,  9-7, in the men's Wimbledon final.   D1    BUSINESS DAY   C1-16    Online Grocer Shuts Down  Webvan, which epitomized the buoyant optimism that the Internet could revolutionize even the most entrenched industries, closed after spending nearly all the $1.2 billion put up by investors, saying it would seek bankruptcy protection.   A1    Time Executive to Lead CNN  Walter Isaacson, 49, the editorial director of Time Inc. and a former managing editor of Time magazine, was named to succeed Tom Johnson, who resigned two weeks ago as chairman and chief executive of CNN, which is battling Fox News Channel, MSNBC and CNBC.   C1    Assessing Proposed Cable Deal  AT&T cable subscribers would probably see a more efficient operation if Comcast acquired AT&T's cable operation, analysts said, though that efficiency might not translate into lower prices or better programming.   C1    Comcast shares dropped 7 percent, to $39.30, as investors absorbed the company's unsolicited $44.5 billion offer for AT&T's cable business.

But his creation, Dawn Wiener, the movie's 11-year-old protagonist, is no Brooke Shields pretty baby. Dawn, played by a young actress named Heather Matarazzo, is \\"Wiener dog,\\" the supergeek of Benjamin Franklin Junior High. Her plodding search for love in a New Jersey suburb is handicapped by her babyish Danskin pants, her smiley-face earrings and the fact that she hasn't yet discovered contact lenses.         The cheerleaders call her \\"lesbo,\\" her teacher calls her a \\"grade grubber,\\" and even her own mother takes away her dessert. As if making a leading lady of Dawn weren't perverse enough, Mr. Solondz sets his antiheroine in an antiplot that flouts every Hollywood formula. Dawn never gets an Alicia Silverstone makeover. Nor does she figure out a way to get the attention of Steve (played by Eric Mabius), the high school student on whom she has a life-threatening crush.
