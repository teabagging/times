There was the young nun, initiated into the pleasures of her order by a priest with something more than spiritual ecstasy on his mind. There was the rich merchant who jealously guarded his wife while his own eye wandered widely. Fools all -- victims of lust and greed who got their just deserts in the end, taken by the hand by Death himself, his skull frozen in a perpetual grin. But in the meantime, their bawdy adventures were part of a stunningly directed, musically refined sea journey, a model of historical re-creation and invention.   This production by the Mannes Camerata was described as a \\"16th-century morality play with music,\\" but orthodox devotees of historical form might be put off. \\"The Ship of Fools\\" never existed as it was performed. During the last decade, Paul C. Echols, who directs the early music program at Mannes, has been widely praised for his work in staging medieval and early Baroque music dramas. But there are no extant musical scores for morality plays, those medieval dramas that had it both ways, entertaining crowds with dramatizations of the most entertaining sins and then revealing punishments awaiting any who might be tempted to practice what they watch.

He is drawn to the fete ''by a sense of a small mystery,'' which is surely the idlest speculation ever indulged in even by a retired English policeman.

Parker's latest Spenser thriller is spare, fast-paced and exciting. But \\"Double Deuce\\" is about relations between the sexes as much as anything else. So one might as well describe its plot in terms of three significant developments.   In the first, someone shoots and kills a 14-year-old girl and her 3-month-old daughter in front of a Boston housing project whose address is 22 Hobart Street (hence the title). In the second, a television reporter named Jackie Raines joins Spenser and his sidekick, the imperturbable Hawk, in their search for the suspected killers among the youth gangs that terrorize the project.

Together with a nearby commercial development that could be as large as a million square  feet, the activity illustrates the continuing production of market-rate housing  on the island, activity that the chief city planning official for the area says  has increased in the last year.         For the first nine months of 1995, building permits were granted for 838 buildings or 1,234 dwelling units on the island, mostly single-family and two-family houses, according to Douglas Brooks, chief of the Staten Island office of the Department of City Planning. For all of 1994, permits were given for 964 buildings or 1,265 units and in 1993, 985 buildings or 1,185 units received permits. \\"You can see an upswing in building permits,\\" said Mr. Brooks. \\"If the growth shown for 1995 stayed at the same rate for the last three months, you'd see a considerable jump, to 1,645 building permits.\\"    Postings: Housing Activity Is Growing, City Official Says","excerpt":"2 Developments Planned for S.I."},{"year":"1950","title":"Contracts totaling $186,361,400 for the building of ten low-rent housing projects in New York that will provide apartments for 14,386 families have been signed during the last year by the Public Housing Administration.

It lives up to its subtitle, \\"Fairy Tales for Dancers,\\" by taking its mostly young cast through brief dances in which each plays a fairy-tale character on a stage decorated with familiar props, backdrops and elements of sets from other ballets in the company's repertory. Ravel's music, from \\"Ma Mere l'Oye,\\" is delicately melodic. And the end effect has the elusiveness of a faint lingering scent of perfume.    The opening, in which a woman reads to dancers sprawling about her on the floor, has a leaden, obligatory tone. But then the stories begin, as the Good Fairy saves Princess Florine (Sleeping Beauty) from death and arranges for a series of fairy-tale dreams to entertain her while she slumbers. The tales of Beauty and the Beast, Hop o' My Thumb and Laideronnette, Empress of the Pagodas, unfold in abbreviated fashion, then Prince Charming arrives and kisses her into wakefulness and marriage.
