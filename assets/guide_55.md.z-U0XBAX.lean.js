She has been totally subservient in marriage and remains dutiful during their separation. The laundry becomes the central symbol of a wife's self-subjugation and the hesitancy with which she assumes a life of independence. For the Matsumotos, the Japanese-American couple at the heart of the play, habit is indeed a great deadener.   The two are trapped not only by that long, lingering marriage but also by the memory of their confinement in an internment camp during World War II. That experience casts a continuing shadow over their lives and over the play itself.
