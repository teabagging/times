The producers, determined, apparently, not to be outdone by Mr. Ziegfeld, go him one better and sentimentalize, if not exactly glorify, the American show girl.Even from the most charitable viewpoint one could hardly say that the present offering is convincing either in its plot or the manner in which it has been handled. It is a slight, clumsy effort in which most of the time-worn stock situations have been resurrected and which results in highly inadequate entertainment.The heroine of \\"The Heart of a Follies Girl\\" is one Teddy O'Day, the \\"chief attraction\\" at the Follies. On her birthday an ardent admirer, the wealthy but aging Roger Winthrop, meets with a slight accident and sends his young secretary, Derek Calhoun, to take her out to supper.They fall in love and when Derek, who has misinterpreted his position, explains that he is poor, Teddy frowns upon the idea of marriage, as she has known poverty before becoming a star. Later she relents and accepts the ring Derek has purchased with a forged check.Subsequently Winthrop humiliates Derek when he learns of the engagement and then has him jailed for forgery. In some manner that the director has seen fit not to disclose Derek escapes and returns to his wife—he and Teddy during all this have, presumably, just slipped out and got married—at a time when a parole is not far off. Teddy persuades Derek to give himself up, explaining that, true happiness results only from suffering, and the picture ends with Derek telephoning to police headquarters.Billie Dove as Teddy, Larry Kent in the rôle of Derek and Lowell Sherman playing the part of Winthrop are serious and determined but hardly inspired.

Danny Jackson, who pitched for the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series, was the only member of the Cincinnati Reds in this year's Series with previous Series experience. When did a team last play in a Series without any of its performers having been in one before?      A. It doesn't happen often and it hasn't happened in 29 years, since another team from Cincinnati made it to the World Series. Among the members of the 1961 Reds, National League pennant winners under Fred Hutchinson, every participant was a Series rookie.   It showed. The mighty Yankees of Mantle, Maris and Ford -- whose participants included only three players without Series experience (Jack Reed, an outfielder","excerpt":"Billy Gardner, an infielder, and Bud Daley, a pitcher) -- won in five games. Those Yankees were part of a run of 14 Series appearances in 16 years from 1949-64. Those Reds had won the first Cincinnati pennant in 22 years.   Excluding the first dozen World Series, where many participants were first-timers, only one other team in the last 50 years used players in the Series who had never played in one. That team, the 1944 St. Louis Browns, also lost the Series, in six games, to the intracity-rival Cardinals, who had been there the two previous seasons. For the Browns, relocated in Baltimore since 1954, it was the only time they took part in post-season play. Origin of Battery     Q.    Why are the pitcher and catcher in baseball referred to as \\"the battery?\\"      A. The term appears to have military roots, though there is also speculation, as noted in \\"The Dickson Baseball Dictionary,\\" that the baseball \\"battery\\" was derived from telegraphy, with the pitcher being the transmitter and the catcher the receiver and the two working on the same wave length in order to be successful. That sure would fit those pitchers who sometimes throw closely to batters in order to \\"send a message\\" to the opposition.   But the military metaphor of a battery resembling the heavy artillery of an army seems to reflect more suitably the role of the pitcher and catcher as the crux of a team's attack. After all, the pitcher's duty is to \\"fire\\" the ball from a mound, frequently with \\"smoke\\" on it, to a catcher hopefully equipped with an arm like a \\"cannon\\" who could \\"gun down\\" the enemy on the bases. And these days, there's even a \\"radar gun\\" to measure the speed of the \\"bullets\\" being thrown at the batter.   Sometimes, though, things can backfire for the battery, and if too many pitches are \\"powdered\\" by hitters, the pitcher will be \\"shelled\\" from the mound, prompting the field manager to call up a reserve pitcher to put out the fire. Conversion Runback     Q.    In the college football game last month between Syracuse and Pittsburgh, Pitt scored 2 points when one of its players blocked Syracuse's attempt to kick an extra point after touchdown and another Pitt player picked up the ball and ran it downfield into the Syracuse end zone. If Syracuse had been attempting a 2-point conversion and had passed the ball into the Pitt end zone, only to see a Pitt player pick it off, could the interceptor have returned the ball downfield?      A. He sure could have, and such a runback of an interception also would have fetched Pitt 2 points. The rule on turnovers during conversion attempts is the same regarding kicking, running or passing, but in this example, the net effect would have been different because instead of creating a 3-point swing (preventing 1 point by blocking the kick and scoring 2 points by running the ball downfield), Pitt would have achieved a 4-point swing (2 saved on the interception and 2 earned on the runback). Grounding the Ball     Q.    In the closing seconds of the game between the Giants and the Phoenix Cardinals last week, Jeff Hostetler, the Giants' quarterback, took the snap and immediately spiked the ball, stopping the clock with three seconds to play and setting up the game-winning field goal. Since there was no potential receiver in the area to which Hostetler \\"threw\\" the ball, why weren't the Giants penalized for intentionally grounding the ball?      A. This deliberate downing demanded no deliberation by the officials, since the play has been part of the National Football League rules since 1987. Before that, a quarterback in the same pickle would intentionally throw the ball out of bounds to stop the clock. Extra time was needed to retrieve the ball and realign the teams, so to save time, the rulesmakers gave quarterbacks the time-saving device of merely throwing the ball down immediately after the snap, while under no pressure from the defense.   The rule on intentional grounding of a forward pass applies to throws made under duress to an area with no eligible receiver around. That thrown ball would draw a penalty. Hostetler's did not, and the difference in the rulings underlines the fundamental distinction between the two types of deliberate groundings: one seeks to prevent a loss of yardage and the other seeks to prevent a loss of time.

Last spring, the singer, pianist and protege of Liza Minnelli played a successful engagement at the Greenwich Village club Eighty-Eight's that revealed him as a sort of swinging answer to another Minnelli protege, Michael Feinstein. And on Thursday evening he moved a significant rung up the ladder by opening a four-week engagement at Rainbow and Stars (30 Rockefeller Plaza, 65th floor). The date coincides with the release of his first solo album on DRG Records.   Like Mr. Feinstein and Harry Connick Jr., Mr. Stritch, who is 29 years old, has built a musical style that is a personal composite of 1940's and 50's influences. In Mr. Stritch's case, they include the breathy crooning of Dick Haymes and the scat style of Mel Torme. If Mr. Stritch's voice lacks the physical power of his models, his more intimate singing is beguiling in its warmth, delicacy and clarity of diction. He is also one of a handful of singing pianists whose keyboard proficiency, skills in arranging and charm work together to make one forget that he is tied to a piano, even when executing technically demanding flourishes. At Rainbow and Stars, he is joined by David Finck on bass and Dave Ratajczak on drums, whose support enhances the rhythmic strength of singing that even in the quietest moments conveys a steady current of swing.

Schoedsack film which came to the Rivoli last evening, tells a human story in terms so strong and so simple that it seems this tale must have its page in the Bible. Its theme, the struggle of man and his brother ape against the manifold terrors of the jungle, is so close to nature, so free from guile in the telling, that by watching it the spectators may not notice the guiding intelligence behind the film and the care with which the story has been molded from materials of nature. The merit of \\"Rango\\" is that of \\"Chang\\" and \\"Grass\\" before it, two films in which Mr. Schoedsack served as co-producer.The current film was made by Mr. Schoedsack, his wife and a cameraman in the Achin jungles of Sumatra, in the Malay Archipelago. Its characters are four: Ali, an old Sumatran hunter","excerpt":"Bin, his son; Tua, an old orang-utan and Rango, his son. The film is silent, with a talking prologue and a synchronized musical score.In the prologue a little boy in an American home is shooting down his pasteboard tiger beside the hearth with his pop-gun. His uncle from India watches the game and then begins drawing on his experiences in the East for the story of the tiger.The camera moves swiftly across plains and mountains, further and further into the deep green of the upper jungles, to the little spot where Ali and his little bright-eyed boy, Bin, spend their days laying traps for the tiger, the most feared enemy of the huddled tribes further down the mountain, whom the man and boy are fighting to protect.The forest is a rustic idyll during the day until the roar of the tiger reverberates through the trees and the chattering monkeys rush in hordes up ropes and vines to the tops of the trees, where they huddle like the most fear-stricken of humans. Babies are clutched to matronly bosoms and the elders stare in pop-eyed fascination down into the green where the tiger walks.Ali goes into the jungle, leaving Bin alone in the hut. The tiger goes abroad and Rango sleeps huddled in Bin's arms. The lad drives the beast away by discharging his father's gun. At the climax the boy and his pet are pursued through the jungle by a tiger, which stops long enough to kill Rango, giving Bin a moment's grace. The boy runs and frees the tethered water buffalo, and the faithful beast of burden defends his little master in a fight to the death, finally spearing the life from the thrashing tiger. The boy rushes to the arms of his father, but the bereft Tua sits in a high tree top, inconsolable.Mr. Schoedsack has endowed the entire film with a wonderfully intimate feeling of authenticity, the result of skillful editing and expert photography. \\"Rango\\" differs from recent jungle films in the universal nature of\\" its theme and the quiet intelligence and deceptive force of its development.

Like dozens of its predecessors, \\"Paris Honeymoon\\" is practically an improvisation in theatrical nonchalance and by as nonchalant a company of script-kidders as you'd ever hope to meet.It may be that the old radio trick of \\"kidding the script\\" isn't so constructive as improving it beforehand would be, but it makes for agreeable relations between the players and the audience, subtly identifying both parties to the transaction as reciprocal sufferers. Bing, for instance, never bothers to pretend that he is really a millionaire cowboy, really in love with Shirley Ross, the heiress divorcée. Later, when the script keeps Miss Ross in Paris, awaiting her final decree, and sends Bing on to get involved with a peasant girl in a Ruritanian castle he has rented for the season, he doesn't even pretend that he has fallen in love with Franciska Gaal and her Gaalic piquancy, easy as that should have been. One thing about Bing, you never catch him acting. He is always himself.Or take Miss Ross, who isn't hard to take, either. Has she any desire to convince you that she is a genuine heiress-divorcée? In the circumstances it would be foolish to try. Could Akim Tamiroff as the tavern keeper be mistaken for anybody save himself, clowning? Is Edward Everett Horton like anybody in the world except a movie actor named Edward Everett Horton, master of the double and triple take, tireless trotter-out of a varied yet pleasantly predictable assortment of grimaces, shudders, smirks, exaggerated deadpans? And regarding Miss Gaal: would even Mr. LeBaron, Paramount's head of production, have the gall to maintain that her behavior suggests that of any possible peasant girl? Don't be absurd! Only one member of the cast gives pause to our little thesis, and that is Ben Blue. He really acts like the village idiot.

Now, helped in large measure by digitally remastered recordings of his early work, Crosby is riding a richly deserved revival.    Two television biographies help explain why. Currently on the Disney Channel, getting its next play tomorrow night at 10:30, is \\"Bing! His Legendary Years,\\" narrated with unabashed hero worship by the comedian Dennis Miller, his usual scattershot irony discarded for the occasion.
