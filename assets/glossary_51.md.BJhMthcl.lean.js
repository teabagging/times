That was the pattern after other recessions. The problem is that capital spending lately has failed to perform according to script.   During the recession, it declined only mildly, avoiding the steep plunges of previous recessions. The concern is that the mild decline in capital spending will be followed, in the recovery, by an equally mild rebound in capital spending. But even if capital spending rebounds sharply, will it create thousands of new jobs, as it has in the past? The answer appears to be no, which means the recovery will be harder to sustain.

That should herald the approach of a strong recovery, after nearly four years of stagnation. And maybe it does. But capital spending has surged without yet creating new jobs. And the economy needs many new jobs to boom.   Capital spending has risen not because companies are expanding and adding workers, but because they are replacing old equipment. Roughly 25 percent of the $20 billion jump in capital spending since last spring, for example, has been used to replace old tractor-trailer trucks. Most of the rest has gone for new computers, communications gear and other office devices. Advances in technology have made the new equipment faster, smaller, and more efficient than that which it replaced. And, above all, it is labor saving.

The obelisk would be built on U Thant Island, a small, rocky outcropping in the East River near the United Nations. It would consist of nine slabs of granite and metal, fastened together by metal wires. The wires would extend down into the river. Over the centuries, the salt water would gradually corrode the wires, at a predetermined rate. That would cause the panels to molt -- to fall away, one at a time. By the year 3000, when the last of the granite panels falls away, the glass core, containing the time capsule and its data, would stand revealed.

He got an education. He got a job, and provided a home for his family. He was, in short, like millions of his fellow immigrants -- lucky in his parents' choice of a new country. In 40 years of film making, he never stopped celebrating that luck and that country.   It was, perhaps, an America that never was: this place where the little guy was the truly big guy, and where good -- in the form of honesty and innocence and self-sacrifice -- invariably triumphed over evil. Mr. Smith went to Washington, and showed the Senate what a patriot really was. Mr. Deeds went to town from the country, and shamed the city slickers. George Bailey, who thought he was a failure, realized (thanks to an angel named Clarence) that he had a wonderful life.
