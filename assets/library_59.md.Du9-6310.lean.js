The Hopalong Cassidy series is its name and we have been hearing for months about the wide swath it has been cutting on juvenile row. Not knowing Hopalong is just about as bad as not knowing Terry and the Pirates or Buck Rogers or Jimmy Allen. It unfits you for association with your juniors. They regard you with mingled scorn and pity if you admit that you have never heard of him or it, or whatever this Hopalong represents.Arthur Mayer, the Harvard-bred but otherwise astute managing director of the Rialto, has come belatedly to the rescue of the unlettered. He has brought Hopalong to Broadway—it's his first visit in five starts, the others detouring into the neighborhood Saturday matinees—in \\"Three on the Trail.\\" It is a mighty nice title, covering as it does the same story Clarence Mulford has been writing for years, and it proves what we have been suspecting right along—that this Hopalong Cassidy is a Caruso of the horse opera.As Pecos Kane tells his assembled rustlers in the Bloody Gulch saloon, \\"Lay off! That's Cassidy. He's bad medicine!\\" But Cassidy, he just grims, eases his unerring .45's in their sagging holsters and makes life as difficult as possible for Pecos and his gang. He foils the villains when they try to hold up the stage, he outsmarts Pecos when he tries to work his deviltry on the blond young school marm and he tosses a can of gunpowder into the good old Bloody Gulch where the rustlers are making their last stand.We seem to have seen Hopalong Cassidy before. There, for a while, he looked like Bill Hart, and then he served under the tall sombrero of Tom Mix. Hoot Gibson played him for years and so did Tim McCoy, Ken Maynard and Buck Jones.

Mr. Benson, in what must have been intended as a combination thriller-comedy-love story-musical, manages to make himself seem ill-suited to any of these genres, let alone a messy mélange of them all.\\"Die Laughing,\\" which opens today at Loews State and other theaters, features Mr. Benson as a taxi driver whose dream is to sing. He is a terrible taxi driver","excerpt":"we know that because his cab has a dangling fender and because his first taxi-driving sequence shows him pulling up onto a curb, in a gesture too broadly dopey for most television sit-coms. He is also not much of a singer, although the film's point is otherwise. It features a number of his songs, including one that wins him a talent competition, though the punk band that plays before him sounds considerably better.Mr. Benson's cabby falls into a furiously frivolous story involving murder, intrigue and the kidnapping of a monkey that has memorized a scientific formula that can wreck the world. The archvillain of the piece is Bud Cort, dismally overplaying an effete meanie, and among Mr. Cort's cohorts are a lineup of unappealing bit players specially chosen for their nasty faces. This is perhaps meant to contrast unfavorably with Mr. Benson and his romantic co-star (Linda Grovenor), since they both have pert profiles and the fluffiest of hair. But Mr. Benson's adorableness becomes such a weight upon the film that the heavies begin to seem a welcome relief.\\"Die Laughing\\" has been directed at a hysterical pitch by Jeff Werner so that Mr. Benson's most feverishly dramatic scenes almost look like silent-movie comedy. The soundtrack is full of loud, shocking noises.

Loren Hawn, police chief of the small New Mexico city of Atocha in the early years of the next century, prides himself on knowing where all the bodies are buried in his jurisdiction. He is handy with his fists, a sure shot, a good ol' boy and team player who does his best to keep this little corner of the world safe for nice people like his wife and their two daughters.   Before introducing us to the puzzle of the body that won't stay buried, Mr. Williams takes time to show us Loren's world. We meet the cops and the drug smugglers, the politicos and the prostitutes, the cowboys and the drunks and the hangers-on at the local bars and diners. We learn about the closing of the nearby copper mine, Atocha's biggest employer, and the arrival of Advanced Technology Laboratories, a tight-lipped outfit doing some kind of classified research out in the desert. We learn that Loren drives his old car one-handed while drinking a can of grape soda that his wife packs with his brown-bag supper","excerpt":"we learn that Atocha is a city of many churches, including the Church of the Apostles of Elohim and the Nazarene (a Mormon offshoot), which Loren attends; we learn that Loren wears a necktie with \\"velcro tabs in back so that it would come free if someone grabbed it in a fight.\\" Above all we learn that Loren is a kind of Southwestern Columbo: he is a lot smarter than he looks.   When a dead man staggers into his office and dies (for the second time in 20 years) right in front of him, Loren seeks answers from the scientists who work at the laboratory outside of town; this leads him to a confrontation with the security forces who zealously guard the scientists' privacy. As the story unfolds, we are not surprised to learn that Loren will do anything to bring a murderer to justice, even if means poking into the mysteries of high-energy physics or taking the law into his own hands.    Mr. Williams is as much in command of his territory as Loren is of his. The scientific content and the world view that it engenders are essential to the story, making this true science fiction. Except for a tendency to calibrate Loren's emotional state to the frequency of his heartbeats, the writing throughout is taut, clean and as revealing to the discerning eye as the erosion pattern that Loren observes on the flat bottom of Wahoo Wash, \\"its sandy soil covered with salt deposits in the shape of ancient, long-evaporated ripples.\\"   Brian W. Aldiss, the British writer whose ambitious \\"Helliconia\\" trilogy is a landmark of modern science fiction, offers up a structural and stylistic hodgepodge in DRACULA UNBOUND (Harper Collins, $18.95). On the serious side, he takes a close look at Bram Stoker's 1897 novel about the bloodsucking count and speculates that its unspoken theme was syphilis, a disease common in late Victorian England and the cause of Stoker's death in 1912. At the same time Mr. Aldiss advances the notion that vampires are, in reality, long-lived creatures descended from coldblooded relatives of the dinosaurs. Either premise alone might have formed the basis of a successful story; jumbled together, they make for a confusing and inexcusably sloppy time-travel narrative that shuttles between Victorian England, present-day America, the future and the far past.   While the chapters that feature Stoker himself as a character are both convincing and poignant, Mr. Aldiss's ear for contemporary American diction is, to say the least, unreliable: \\"Buster . . . if you leave this hotel, you leave it on your own, and our marriage is a dead duck.\\" For every memorable phrase like \\"You come from a time when all blood was cool and thick and slow and lizard-flavored,\\" we get a slack string of words like \\"This was a different hedonism from the aerial plunge from the womb of the speeding plane.\\" Much of the time Mr. Aldiss seems to be making up the plot as he goes along; the result is a book that must have been a lot more satisfying to write than it is to read.   ARMAGEDDON: The Musical (Dell, Paper, $8.95) by Robert Rankin makes the mistake of inviting comparison to one of the classics of science fiction humor, Douglas Adams's \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" Where Mr. Adams employed the cliches of science fiction to poke fun at familiar human foibles like arrogance and vanity, Mr. Rankin takes aim at a more parochial target: television.    In a singularly nasty postnuclear future, survivors must watch their television screens in order to earn food and housing credits. Indeed, the surviving governments and the surviving broadcast networks are indistinguishable, as are the remaining food-synthesizing conglomerates and the Big Three religions: the Buddhists, the Fundamentalists and the Jesuits. The most popular show of all features on-air executions of heretics by the Living God himself, the latest reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. When inhabitants of this hellish world take leave of one another, their cheery valediction is \\"Have another day.\\"   As if all this weren't hilarious enough, it turns out that human history has been manipulated from afar by inhabitants of the planet Phnaargos, for whom our suffering is the stuff of a popular local series entitled \\"The Earthers.\\" The clash between two media-mad cultures allows Mr. Rankin to satirize rapacious television executives from so many different angles that the weary reader may actually begin to sympathize with this otherwise un appealing breed. The appearance (via time travel) of Elvis Presley does little to enliven matters, and by the time Jesus Christ and his sister, Christeen, make the scene, not even a miracle could rescue the book from an elephantiasis of expectations, a disease that strikes humorists who assume that if a particular gag is mildly amusing, the laughs will increase exponentially with each repetition. Disputing the cosmologists who say the universe began with a big bang, Mr. Rankin reveals that it actually started with \\"the sound of a duck call, followed by a whistle and an enormous cosmic wind-break.\\" Just in case you missed it, the next paragraph refers to a \\"burst of celestial flatulence.\\" And so it goes.   Michael Swanwick's enigmatic STATIONS OF THE TIDE (Morrow, $19.95) opens with this sentence: \\"The bureaucrat fell from the sky.\\" It ends with this sentence: \\"Changing, the bureaucrat fell to the sea.\\" In between, the bureaucrat, who is actually a kind of spy, attempts to recover from the planet Miranda some proscribed technology stolen by a local magician named Gregorian. The bureaucrat's almost impossible task is made even more difficult by violent changes on the planet's surface. When the \\"jubilee tides\\" of Miranda's oceans begin to roll, entire continents that were dry for decades will be submerged. Evolution has taught the native life forms to adapt to the change, but humans who have settled the planet must move to higher ground. The onrushing sea will cover many secrets, among them the fate of the planet's aboriginal sentient species, known as \\"the haunts.\\"   Miranda, a world of tale-spinners, witches, conjurers and other shape-changers, is but a mirror image of the galactic civilization for which the bureaucrat toils. What makes Mr. Swanwick's story so engrossing, and at the same time so hard to follow, is the way he conflates the mysteries of the body, the mysteries of machines and the mysteries of ecology.   Among his trials, the bureaucrat undergoes a sexual initiation at the hands of a witch named Undine; although these scenes deal with what might be called the mechanics of sex, they are also playful, erotic and disturbing. At his best, Mr. Swanwick challenges the routine ways we divide up the world. He pursues elusive truths that resist pigeonholing.

Widely regarded as the father of industrial film making, Handy in 1911 founded the Jam Handy Organization \\"to harness the arts and equipment of the theater for sales conventions.\\" Early in his career, he pioneered the use of still images in strip films (later known as filmstrips) and even invented a small projector called the Explainer, which could be carried in a salesman's pocket for presentations in stores, factories and private homes. By the 1930's, the Jam Handy Organization was producing advertising and motivational films for major American corporations -- filmstrips like \\"The Inside Story of Bread\\" and \\"If the Shoe Pinches\\" -- and packaging the American Dream for all to enjoy. \\n\\nThe images here are the spores of Handy's philosophy. Culled from such midcentury filmstrips as \\"The Man Who Sells\\" and \\"Let's Help Them Buy!,\\" they trained a generation of American salesmen how to look good, be liked and, most important, make the sale. Sadly, the particular pedagogic moral of each image has been lost over time","excerpt":"we may never know what gem of wisdom Mr. Salesman is expected to glean from the \\"prospect box,\\" above right. Still, it's hard not to imbue them with more than was intended. Mr. Salesman's faceless stare reminds me of the utopian promise Southern California held out to those of us who grew up in the 1950's, watching treeless streets of identical houses shoot up as thousands of acres of orange groves were simultaneously mowed down.

Although the movie appears to have been photographed almost entirely on Florida location and although its cast includes some good actors, David Carradine, Kate Jackson, and Sterling Holloway. \\"Thunder and Lightning\\" is less like a live-action movie than a 95-minute Bugs Bunny cartoon—which is one of the nicest things about it.Mr. Carradine plays an independent-minded young bootlegger, a fellow who wears an earring in his left ear and who swaggers with just a little more self-assurance than his charm allows. Miss Jackson, one of the better comedians to come out of television, is his friend, the daughter of the syndicate-backed bootlegger who is Mr. Carradine's nemesis.The movie begins with a chase involving swamp buggies, and later shifts in various makes and models of automobiles. There's hardly a moment in the movie when someone's not being pursued by, or in pursuit of someone else. It's painless, sometimes funny, good-natured, as well as extremely prolife. As in a Bugs Bunny work, no one is permanently damaged by the non-stop mayhem. This is no big deal, I suppose, though as soon as one realizes this is its method, watching the movie becomes a benignly peaceful experience.Roger Corman, sometimes known as the King of the Bees—B-pictures—who has given early employment to such directors as Francis Ford Coppola, Peter Bogdanovich and Jonathan Demme, produced \\"Thunder and Lightning.\\" It was directed by Corey Allen and written by William Hjortsberg","excerpt":"we may well be hearing from them again. \\"Thunder and Lightning,\\" which has been rated PG (\\"Parental Guidance Suggested\\"), contains some vulgar language and a lot of action but no real violence.

Mitchell’swas a time of social upheaval, when America and its children werequesting for a new identity and an opportunity to improve the world;it was indeed the liberal hour during which the faith thatintellectual idealism and political progressivism held the key to thefuture of humanity ran rampant. Colleges at the time were, of course,intimately linked to this phenomenon, and served as incubators forbudding intellectuals and safe-havens for political theorizing anddebate. Today, we live in a very different social climate, one inwhich faith in the government has greatly dwindled, and dwindlesstill, and a certain mixture of fear and paranoia have cast aparalyzing shadow over the sunny progressivism of days now gone by.Disillusionment with the two-party system, or at least with the twoparties themselves, widely publicized government fiascos and scandal,floundering support for the president, and fear of disturbing worldrealities like terrorism have created a situation where people haveinsulated themselves from the realm of external world affairs,“Politics” and all it entails.

Within the limited space afforded by the Soviet polity, the two leaders differed profoundly in the ways they addressed a number of fundamental problems faced by the country's political, economic and cultural institutions. It is far from clear whether Andropov's approach was more preferable to the Soviet people, as Mr. Medvedev seems to think.  In the absence of a free press and effective legislative supervision of the executive power, how does one control political and economic elites? Whatever other means were tried by Brezhnev, often unsuccessfully, the Stalinist methods were a taboo. Andropov's answer was mass demotions, dismissals, secret trials and executions.  In the absence of viable material incentives, how does one increase productivity? The essence of the state-labor relations in the Soviet Union is nicely captured by a popular adage: ''They pretend thay pay us","excerpt":"we pretend we work.'' While the Brezhnev period actually saw a dramatic increase in real payments, which resulted in an unprecedented rise in the standard of living, the leader abided by this unwritten social contract and, again, decidedly refused to rely on terror. Andropov responded with pogrom-like raids on bath houses, stores, cinemas and restaurants in search of ''shirkers,'' with severe penalties for those late for work and, to crown it all, with his own innovation - the infamous ''black boxes'' for anonymous denunciations.

This newcomer has already captured a clientele enthusiastic not only for nicely prepared pasta dishes but also for the many splendidly fresh fish offerings in which this dining spot specializes. Thus it is of little surprise that, in delicious compatibility, a partner in this new enterprise is also the owner of the fish shop next door. Our conservative rating reflects the kitchen's occasional tendency to oversalt","excerpt":"we recommend that when placing an order one reminds the kitchen to use a light hand with that seasoning. \\n\\nThe menu is loaded with fish and shellfish items, with more recited from a list of daily specials. To know what to expect, check the window of the Highridge Fishery next door before entering the restaurant. While fresh fish often is not enough, the offerings at Stella di Mare are; and, in addition, they are timed carefully and embellished suitably, if not lavishly, with luscious strips of shiitake mushrooms appearing with welcome frequency.\\n\\nOne might begin a meal with a plate of tasty shellfish -- green-shelled New Zealand mussels, baby little necks and the elusive razor clams. Or have shrimp cocktail; these pink and white jumbos don't come better. \\n\\n Piscators can move happily to entrees starring the clear-tasting sea creatures. A hefty steak, not a thin fillet, fullfilled our order for grilled salmon, and a thick slab of moist, ivory-fleshed swordfish arrived in Champagne sauce, festooned with capers (an ingredient the chef seems to favor sometimes too enthusiastically) and minced shallots.  Perfectly cooked sea scallops were somewhat overwhelmed by a rich sauce of pure heavy cream flavored with a dash of Cognac and saffron. Prepared in any way the diner pleases, remarkably tender calamari is always on hand. Ordering from the menu, we enjoyed this sea mollusk stuffed and, on another visit, in the daunting Lucifero style, that is, cooked in its ink and served whole -- tentacles and all. Prepare to find ingenuous presentations.\\n\\n And consider ordering one of the daily specials.  We were more than pleased with sweet, delicate orange roughi and pompano, well-matched with Jamaican rum sauce but unceremoniously heaped with shellfish. \\n\\n Entrees other than fish received proper treatment as well. Our request for dark instead of white meat honored, chicken Portofino turned out to be a sumptuous concoction, with shiitake mushrooms, bits of prosciutto and minced shallots bound by a sauce of cream, and port and Cognac moistening the butterflied, pounded collops of chicken. Sliced filet mignon in red wine arrived with perfect rareness, as ordered.\\n\\n In large or small portions, pasta items also deserve attention. A generous dollop of black caviar garnished a dish of penne under a glistening sauce of tomato-pinked cream thinned with a shot of vodka. And chunks of tomato and mildly spicy chili pepper showered rigatoni in the style arrabbiata, a substantial, satisfying dish, as was fusilli alla Siciliana, with eggplant, olives and tomatoes. Diners who can take the richness should look for the special spaghetti with lobster and tomato sauce. \\n\\n Fresh strawberries ended the meal nicely. Otherwise, a frothy, freshly made-to-order zabaglione was once perfectly balanced but on another occasion clobbered with the almondy flavor of Marsala. Those with a taste for the dry variety of homemade cheesecake might like Stella di Mare's. \\n\\n A three-course dinner averages $29 without drinks, tax and tip.\\nStella di Mare \\n\\nGood \\n\\n 1791A Central Park Avenue (Highridge Plaza), Yonkers. 337-0491.\\n\\n Atmosphere: Small, neat and cheery storefront dining room with glittery sconces and mirrors, flame-stitched chair seats, silk flowers and crisp napery; but needing the depth another mirror could give to one dead wall.

On such a day it was easy to understand why the back country tempts downhill skiers from their lift lines, and why flat-track cross-country skiers strap on heavy packs and venture off groomed courses into the mountains. But even without perfect conditions, a wilderness trek on skis can provide a memorable and challenging outdoor adventure. It is also excellent exercise, as sore muscles reminded me. \\n\\n\\nShrine Mountain lies on a segment of the 10th Mountain Trail Association's 300-mile web of trails through the area loosely bounded by Vail, Aspen and Leadville. Like its inspiration, the European Haute Route linking Zermatt, Switzerland, with Chamonix, France, the 10th Mountain system includes a series of huts spaced about a day apart. As in Europe, expert guide services are available, making the back country accessible to cross-country skiers with average skills and to better skiers without the time, equipment or expertise to organize a wilderness ski tour on their own. \\n\\nWhile once essentially the province of winter mountaineers who spent their nights in tents set up on the snow, the remote valleys and ridges along the 10th Mountain routes offer surprising comforts. Who minds melting snow for water or chopping a bit of communal wood when there are solar-powered lights, a big, warm living room, a well-equipped kitchen and comfortable beds waiting? \\n\\nNamed for the 10th Mountain Division of the United States Army, which trained in the area during World War II, the system owes its existence to a group of early supporters and volunteers who donated time, talent and money. The 10th Mountain Trail Association was formed in 1980 by wilderness recreation enthusiasts such as the former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and 10th Mountain veterans including the Aspen architect Fritz Benedict. Working with an initially skeptical United States Forest Service, the group developed environmentally sound plans for trails. If the plan proved unworkable after five years, the huts would be torn down, an option that happily has proved unnecessary. One more hut was added west of Leadville this summer, narrowing the gap to Aspen. With the completion of a 10th hut next year, the trails will form the bottom half of a loop linking Vail, Aspen and Leadville.\\n\\nThe first structures, Margy's and McNamara huts, designed by Fritz Benedict, opened on trails north of Aspen in 1982. Eight years, seven huts and hundreds of miles of trails later, the 10th Mountain system offers a taste of spectacular Colorado wilderness and comfortable back country lodging to thousands of skiers. \\n\\nTrue to the original intent, prices are affordable: $20 a person for a night's stay in one of the association's huts (most privately owned huts along the trails are $14 to $27 a night). Reservations for overnight stays have grown from 2,252 in the winter of 1983-84 to nearly six times that last winter. \\n\\nAt least 85 percent of the overnight guests ski in on their own, the association says, a feat that should be attempted only by intermediate or better back-country skiers with special outdoor skills and experience. Others come with guided parties.\\n\\nThe system's official guidebook describes qualified intermediates as cross-country skiers who can use a strong snowplow for downhill control, can change direction with a parallel or telemark turn, have done long tours with at least 2,000 feet of elevation gain at altitudes of over 8,000 feet and can read a topographic map, compass and altimeter.  \\n\\nMy attempts at telemarking, even without a backpack, have often ended in mighty struggles to get out of seemingly bottomless powder after a fall, but I have a steady snowplow and can perform kick turns on a steep slope even in floppy cross-country skis. My husband and skiing companion, Bill, is an experienced mountaineer who once spent a month in the snows of Mount Logan in the Yukon.  Together we survived weekend ski tours, complete with nights in a cold tent, a decade ago. Our abilities seemed equal to an intermediate stretch of the 10th Mountain trails, and two comfortable huts. \\n\\n About noon on a Sunday we parked the car at a parking area at Vail Pass, hoisted our gear onto our shoulders, and set out on the 2.7-mile \\"beginners\\" trail into Shrine Mountain Inn for the first night. It was snowing slightly from a leaden sky and the light was disorientingly flat. The 10th Mountain philosophy is to mark trails sparsely , so in the unpeopled whiteness, we watched the topographical map and even practiced with the compass. We had heard snowmobile drivers used this track to the village of Red Cliff, but the stormy weather seemed to have deterred them. \\n\\nABOUT halfway in we met a Vail Associates guide, Anne Dalvera, with five skiers from the Midwest who had spent two nights at our destination. One stopped to catch his breath and tell us that he was having the time of his life but planned to take up a fitness program at home. \\n\\nAt the two log cabins of the privately owned Shrine Mountain Inn, each accommodating 12, we found unexpected comfort. Luxuries included hot showers, towels, a sauna (fueled by wood we chopped ourselves), indoor plumbing, well-appointed kitchens and rough-hewn but sophisticated decor featuring colorful walls and quilt-covered beds. The huts are heated by wood and gas stoves.\\n\\nWe ended up in a cabin where we had our own double room with conventional beds onto which we spread our sleeping bags","excerpt":"we shared a kitchen, living-dining room and bath with another couple. There were also dormitory-style rooms sleeping larger groups. The nightly cost: $27 a person. Thanks to the caterer for a group that was staying at the inn, we also enjoyed the aroma of freshly baked bread as we consumed our freeze-dried dinner. \\n\\nAnother treat was spotting a furry white ermine near the path to the sauna. He looked back at us, twitched his elegant tail, and simply faded into the bluish snow of twilight. \\n\\n The next morning dawned partly clear. Below the porch's large carved woodchuck mascot we said goodbye to our cabin mates, a Denver couple setting out for the Commando Run, a 16-mile, experts-only trail down to Vail. Our ambitions were more modest. Even so, bad weather can turn any route into a challenge. \\n\\nOn the trail, the morning mist thickened and a flew flurries swirled. Soon we were in a near whiteout and the only tracks were our own, fast filling with snow. Compass, map and altimeter seemed inadequate for navigating in a world where even up and down weren't always clear. We knew that the ridge somewhere just above us lay above timberline and could be dangerous in bad weather. The Fowler-Hilliard Hut, where our next two nights were reserved, was 6.8 miles away, along the ridge, down and back up again -- if we could find it. We stopped for a drink of waterand considered backtracking. Too bad about those nonrefundable two-night reservations at the next hut. \\n\\nMoments later luck found us. The air brightened and a hard alpine sun broke through. The ridge line and a 10th Mountain blue diamond tacked on a stake at the 11,740-foot saddle confirmed we were on the right path.  On top with a view of the Mount of the Holy Cross (and if you look closely, the very small Fowler-Hilliard Hut on Resolution Mountain), we used the compass and map to find our way down the sparkling slope to Wearyman Creek. Crows, mountain jays and a lone hawk accompanied us, and we saw fresh tracks of rabbits and what we thought was a bobcat \\n\\nOn the other side of the creek we found a blue diamond at the trail, and a pack of engine-revving snowmobilers who also use this relatively flat summer jeep trail. On nearby Ptarmigan Hill we could see Snowcat loads of \\"powderhounds,\\" downhill skiers brought in for the day, making linked S-curves down the facing slope. \\n\\nOur trail veered up into Engelmann spruce and fir to a series of seemingly endless switchbacks to the hut. That evening, a glass of wine in hand, we lounged by the stove with the pleasantly mingled aroma of simmering dinners, drying clothes and burning wood. The hut had definite advantages over a tent. Several other parties shared the place, which is owned by the 10th Mountain Association and comfortably holds 16. Accommodations here were more typical of the breed. A large room downstairs was divided into communal kitchen, dining and living areas. Wood-fueled stoves provided heat. (There are tasks guests are expected to perform, and chopping wood is one of them; another is collecting snow to melt in the communal pot.)\\n\\nUpstairs were three dormitory-style rooms for sleeping, two with platform beds and one with a continuous U-shaped bench. Foam mats and pillows were supplied, but no linens. There was only an outhouse; washing up was done in the kitchen.\\n\\nOur dinner was simply a matter of adding boiling water to a freeze-dried pack, but other guests cooked spaghetti, stew and the like on the hut's gas stove; the hut provides utensils. Skiers had come in on different routes, and we all had tales to tell. One New England party had broken through the ice of a foot-chilling stream. A group from Boulder, Colo., had donned their ski boots at home that morning for the drive to Vail Pass, and with feet damp from sweating in a heated car, they got impressive blisters on the hike up Wilder Gulch. Fortunately, Scott Messina, the 10th Mountain trail marker and an Aspen Alpine guide, was at the hut to suggest duct tape to protect their feet on their trip back. \\n\\nWHEN word got out that my back was bothering me, several hutmates volunteered soothing massages. The day ended well, and sleep came early. Our layover day at the hut was breezy and clear. Over breakfast of granola and coffee I read the hut logbook. Several parties had spent the night on the trail or had arrived exhausted. One wrote that the most beautiful sight of the day was not the mountains, but the hut at long last. \\n\\nYesterday's light powder had turned to a wet, crusty cement. Some skiable powder remained among the trees below the hut, but expert telemarkers could manage only jerky turns on the open slope. A snow slide down Resolution Mountain reminded us to be wary on the trip out.  Though 10th Mountain trails are selected to avoid avalanche-prone paths, we were aware that any treeless slope of 25 degrees or more bears watching. \\n\\nThe next day we altered our route out to skirt a known slide zone on Ptarmigan Hill above Wilder Creek. Despite the other skiers and snowmobiles we met, for most of the return trek we were alone in a silent white world. The noise of the highway intruded on the silence long before it came into view, prompting us to make plans for next year's trip before we reached the car. \\nSKIING THE BACK COUNTRY\\nLodging\\n\\n The 10th Mountain Trail Association (1280 Ute Avenue, Aspen, Colo. 81611; 303-925-5775) handles reservations for its 9 huts and for 12 private huts along 300 miles of trails in the backcountry out of Vail, Aspen and Leadville. All nine are between 10,360 feet and 11,660feet. Many are very attractive, but they are rustic: most water is provided by melting snow, sleeping is generally on a continuous bench or ledge covered by foam pads, and there are outhouses adjacent to the huts. A night's stay costs $20 at all 10th Mountain Huts. Reservations for holiday weekends and vacation periods are often filled weeks or months in advance. \\n\\nPrivately owned huts include the Shrine Mountain Inn (one of the most luxurious), Vance's Cabin, Polar Star Inn, Janet's Cabin of the Summit County Huts and Trails Association, the six Alfred A. Braun huts near Aspen, the Toklat Chalet and Friends Hut. Prices range from $14 to $27 a night; afternoon tea, dinner, breakfast and a sleeping bag are included in the $60-a-person fee at the Toklat Chalet. \\n\\nThe association, a nonprofit group, also takes reservations for the privately owned Frying Pan River Ranch (also at 303-927-3570), where the cost is $75 a person a night, with all meals; $105 a night for Friday and Saturday.  Two other privately owned lodges along the trails take their own reservations: The Diamond J Guest Ranch (303-927-3222), $24 a person a night ($28 with linens supplied), or $100 for a cabin sleeping six; and Pilgrim's Inn (303-827-5333), $70 to $85 a person a night with breakfast.\\nTours\\n\\nIn the area there are four guide services.\\n\\nParagon Guides (Post Office Box 130, Vail, Colo. 81658; 303-949-4272) is the largest, and offers group and custom tours on all 10th Mountain routes. A three-day Rocky Mountain Weekender tour covers 8 to 16 miles a day, stops at two huts and costs $420 a person, all meals provided. Paragon will provide skis, double boots, poles and climbing skins for $22 a day. The longest trips are eight days, staying at six huts and covering 55 miles, for $1,200 a person. \\n\\nVail Associates Ski School (Post Office Box 7, Vail, Colo. 81658 303-476-5601, extension 4390) runs guided tours that feature the Shrine Mountain and Fowler-Hilliard huts. A three-day guided tour costs $395, a two day tour is $270. Elk Mountain Guides (Post Office Box 10327, Aspen, Colo. 81612,; 303-927-9377) and Aspen Alpine Guides (Post Office Box 7937, Aspen, Colo. 81612; 303-920-8525) specialize in custom tours.\\nEquipment\\n\\nHelpful items available from the 10th Mountain office are a guidebook on the trail system ($15) and topographical maps indicating trails and hut locations ($5 each). There is a single $3 fee for mailing any number of items. \\n\\nThe association sends to those who make reservations a list of gear recommendations.  These include skis, boots and poles designed for the back country, a wax kit and climbing skins, a shovel (for emergency shelter or avalanche rescue), topographical maps, compass and, perhaps an altimeter, sunglasses, sunscreen, a first-aid kit that includes moleskin, and a good backpack. Clothing should be wool, or certain synthetics, not cotton. -- J. P. F.

Wagner, writing about the German Imperial Opera House, noted the same problems, referring to the ''piebald medley'' on stage, with virtuoso singers treating the rest of the opera as a ''superfluous adjunct.''

Freely adapted from \\"Job,\\" the novel by Joseph Roth, \\"Sins of Man\\" is a thoroughly sentimental, painstakingly somber and devastatingly complete portrait of a man in sorrow. While it is uncompromisingly tearful, it happens also to have been splendidly performed, honestly directed and handsomely produced. In sum, a well-planned conspiracy against the lachrymal duct which has been so perfectly organized that it is impervious to any resentful cry of \\"You harrow me!\\"Our preference, frankly, is for a more \\"contrasty\\" negative. \\"Sins of Man\\" has blocked in its tragic shadows solidly, courageously ignoring any romantic sub-plot and only in a few penultimate episodes seeking to bring its heavy theme into clearer relief through recourse to a \\"funny man.\\" Although this is a more mature approach to tragedy than the screen generally employs, and must be encouraged in principle if not in this specific instance, still there is danger in overdoing it.Sophocles himself could not have driven the fates more cruelly against the picture's central figure, Christopher Freyman, sexton and bell-ringer of a small church in the Tyrolean village of Zanebruck. From 1900, when the tale begins, to the current year when it reaches a moist-eyed happy ending, old Freyman is the trembling target for all the slings and arrows of ill-fortune. His wife dies giving birth to their second son, who is found to be a deaf mute. Their elder boy, Karl, refusing to follow his father's bell-ringing career and preferring such barbarities as aeronautics, runs off to America.Reconciled after several years, Freyman goes to America to arrange for a great specialist to restore the deaf Gabriel's hearing. But a plane crash kills Karl, war breaks out, Zanebruck is destroyed and from the casualty lists Freyman learns that Gabriel was among the dead or missing. So it goes, with the twentieth century Job patiently enduring his trials, living in Bowery lodging houses, scrubbing floors, carrying sandwich signs, washing dishes, living in the hope that some day he might find some one who could tell him of Zanebruck and of his missing son. That day comes at last and Job is comforted.The rôle of Freyman, with its chronological and emotional development and its tragic qualities, is one of those of which actors must dream at night, and Mr. Hersholt has handled it with a sure and tender understanding of its values. Although it is a Jannings rôle, there is no reason to praise Mr. Hersholt for a Jannings characterization","excerpt":"we still have some recollection of his work in \\"Greed,\\" filmed twenty years ago. With a performance of that excellence in his background, he becomes his own standard of comparison and this new rôle must take its place in his private gallery of \\"distinguished portrayals.The picture provides, too, a pleasant screen début for Don Ameche, previously identified with the radio. As the Freyman sons when, in turn, they have reached manhood, Mr. Ameche gives a likable and straightforward performance which amply justifies Darryl Zanuck's announced intention of featuring him in several of the new Twentieth Century-Fox films this season. Note, too, on the credit list Allen Jenkins as a Bowery protector of Freyman, J. Edward Bromberg and Ann Shoemaker as a Zanebruck couple, Fritz Leiber as a priest and Mickey Rentschler as the mute Gabriel.

Q. I want to take you back one year ago","excerpt":"we want try to get your thoughts about Sept. 11 in Mexico. A little more than a year ago you were in Washington and you challenged the U.S. to adopt new immigration laws, and doing so you also challenged the U.S. to look at Mexico as more than a poor neighbor; as an equal partner. Some analysts in Mexico have said that after the United States and Afghanistan, Mexico has been the country most affected economically and politically by Sept. 11. How do you see the scope of the impact? A. The first thing, I would confirm that, yes, there was an unprecedented effect on Sept 11. It was unexpected, surprising but at the same time of the highest impact. This impact was felt in the United States, in Mexico and in the whole world. It was a shock for the whole world. And in Mexico's case it hit us at a summit in our relationship. At that moment we were in Congress, where we had won favorable reaction to our proposals. We were at the closest possible point to an agreement with the government of President Bush both on immigration and on a deepening of integration under NAFTA. That is why for us the impact is stronger; to go from the summit of optimism, of positive results, to the unprecedented shock of the terrorist attack. And this effectively forced the United States to concentrate its attention on the issue of security. By dedicating so much concentration to the issue of security, bilateral matters pass to a secondary level. Those matters continue to have enormous importance to us. I ask myself if it is necessary to choose between the two issues. I believe that work can be done on security, in combating terrorism in Mexico we have done our part in this area. But at the same time, the world must continue working. The world must continue advancing, and even more our bilateral relations with the United States. So beginning from Sept. 11, we did introduce in our agenda the issue of security and commitment to fighting terrorism. It's a commitment that we not only made to the U.S. government but also particularly with United Nations Resolution 1373. But at the same time we're working on putting our bilateral agenda back into discussion and the truth is that we haven't managed to reach the levels we had before Sept. 11. So what are we doing? As a consequence we are working on issues that have to do with migration but they are only partial [steps] such as issuing the identification card, the consular identification card, as a security measure in that it fully identifies our compatriots. On the other hand, it also advances the recognition of the rights of illegal immigrants who work in the U.S., who work with U.S. companies, who work with U.S. families, who work with U.S. citizens, and who merit the greatest respect and the greatest acknowledgment for what they do. Q. After Sept. 11, political costs of your support for the United States began to mount. People began to criticize you as having a subservient attitude toward the United States, that you were giving so much and getting nothing in return. You canceled trips to the United States. Congress denied permission for you to travel there. There have been disputes with the United States over the death penalty, water, trade. How do you feel? A: My first clear and resounding answer is that the relationship continues, just as strong, just as friendly. Our partnership is increasingly more committed to the U.S., our partnership for prosperity _ the document signed in Monterrey (inaudible). Regarding your comment, we would have to separate the response into various baskets. One: the reasons for which I did not go on two trips to the United States. The first because effectively the Congress denied me permission to leave. And on this matter I take the opportunity to comment that in Mexico, I find contradicting reactions in regards to relations with the United States. On one side, citizens have great respect for the United States, they have a great feeling of friendship. That is solid. But in the opposition and in the political arena I often find criticism of the closeness of relations with the United States. That is a reality. And it is a reality that flares up every time a new issue arises. And the issue comes up every day. The death penalty, the execution of Javier [Suarez Medina], the Mexican citizen executed in Texas, for us the defense of human rights is a very important issue. It's a priority and we express it each time that a situation that has to do with human rights comes up as in the case of this execution. We had to let the governor of Texas know that we do not share support the death penalty. At the same time we had to let the justice system of Texas know that some elemental rights of this Mexican were violated, as in not having advised the Mexican Consulate of his arrest and of the charges against him. This is a commitment that both Mexico and the U.S. have signed in the Convention of Vienna and which requires us to advise the consulate when this situation arises. And thirdly, well, I could not make a visit to Texas eight days after this Mexican was executed. I let the governor of Texas know. I asked for clemency or that Javier's sentence be changed. I asked that the execution be postponed so that documents could be presented showing the violation of Javier's rights. I asked that the time-frame be extended to make the visit and I did not receive a response. So I saw myself obligated to cancel the trip. As far as the dispute over water is concerned, I think that it was on very good terms. It's an issue where a resolution was pending. The conditions of the Rio Grande River Basin have changed. The level of rainfall that we receive each year has changed and so we have to change the the responses we give. Fortunately, as always happens, we found the response through dialogue with United States authorities and now the the issue of the Rio Grande River Basin is resolved for the next five years. Conflicts like this are constantly arising, problems that we deal with and resolve in a relationship as intense as the one between Mexico and the U.S.. Q. But are you frustrated that your efforts to embark on a new relationship with the United States has not been reciprocated? A. There are feelings on my part that I would not describe as frustration or resentment. But I feel strongly that we need to deal with bilateral issues. I constantly make it known to the American government that we need the same kind of attention for Latin America. Things aren't going well in Latin America and we have to work very hard so that things improve in Latin America. The U.S., Canada and Mexico right now enjoy better conditions of stability and economic development and so we are the most obligated to pay attention to Latin America. In the case of the U.S. and Canada, they should pay attention to Mexico. So, without it being a complaint, without it being a product of frustration, I do constantly call on the administration of President Bush to dedicate more time to bilateral and Latin America issues. Q. Your foreign minister said in an interview recently that Mexico would embark on a new strategy to get the immigration back on the U.S. agenda. Talk to me about that. A. It isn't anything spectacular or terribly innovative. We simply realize that at this moment while the U.S. elections process is going on it won't be possible to raise the migration agenda. In the same way it wasn't possible immediately after Sept. 11. So we are waiting for an important window of opportunity after the U.S. elections. I think that it is the right time to push this theme strongly. And there we would expect reciprocity. We would expect fulfillment of goals. President Bush himself expressed that he would really be an ally in the cause of migration, that we would work together to return the issue to the highest priority, [that we would] work with U.S. legislators as well so that they would look favorably upon this development. This window of opportunity next year [will occur] because the U.S. economy will surely begin growing again and it will require more and more workers [to fill] more and more jobs. So the strategy is to take advantage of this window of opportunity. We will have a very active migration policy next year. Q. Will you work directly with (political) parties and Congress? A. With everybody, legislators, local levels where there is a strong Mexican presence, where the presence of Mexicans is appreciated and valued such as Texas, California, Chicago, and in other parts of the U.S. At the local government level, with the governors, with the state congresses we will have a very active policy on this issue so that hopefully we can fulfill our intention of reaching a result by the end of 2003. Q. Will those plans be successful if there is an attack on Iraq? A. The consequences of an attack on Iraq are not predictable. It appears to me that it would have very broad effects at the global level on many things and it would have very broad effects on bilateral issues and issues on the Latin American agenda. I believe that the issue of Iraq must be the product of deep reflection. It seems to us that this is a matter that should be channeled through the United Nations Security Council; that there should be an opportunity for a visit by United Nations inspectors to Iraq. We, as a country, will be pushing strongly in that direction; in that it will be the U.N. that makes the visit, that it's the U.N. which certifies what conditions are there. But first [we need] objective information to be able to then reflect on the best decisions to take. I think the Iraq situation would have an impact that would affect the whole world. Q. Would you support President Bush? Last night on Televisia, a poll showed that 70 percent of Mexicans are opposed to an attack against Iraq. How does your government feel. A. At this moment we can't take a position, nor make a decision precisely because information is lacking. It would be very important to really know what are Iraq's activities regarding terrorism, what are Iraq's activities regarding weapons of mass destruction, what are its activities in terms of its ability to deliver these weapons. The debate which must take place in the United Nations and in the U.N. Security Council, where we are present, is also important. So for me and for Mexico first we need a lot of information, a lot of objectivity, deep reflection and then we will be able to give an opinion. Q. Last question., you call yourself the president the 123 million Mexicans, including 23 million who live in the United States. Since Sept. 11 deportations have increased, arrests on the border have declined but the number of Mexicans dying on the border has not. How have Mexicans in the United States been affected by Sept. 11. Are their rights in danger? A. Well, as long as we do not reach a solution on immigration, which is the intention, these painful circumstances will occur. We are trying to avoid these painful deaths. We're there on the border, we're in the mountains, we're there with the army. We're there with our border agents dedicated to migration issues. We're working intensely to try to stop these deaths from happening. In the same way, we continue to be very committed to Mexicans in the U.S. We have managed to get the consular identification card accepted throughout the U.S. banking and financial system. With this, migrants can now open checking accounts. We have managed to get this accepted as a full identification card by city, country and state authorities. We have managed to get the card accepted so that Mexicans, even if they are in the United States illegally, can apply for driver's licenses in various cities and counties. We have managed to remove discrimination against them regarding their entry into state universities. In sum, we are working through the consulates to be close to our compatriots and to help them as much as possible. But in the end the best solution is a migration accord.

She still sends out thank-you notes. In her garage is stored furniture from deceased relatives.\\n\\n\\nC. H.: So. You didn't really stay too long in L.A.\\n\\nT. G.: No. My mother was actually chasing my father all over the country. She would drop us off places. We stayed in my aunt's house in New Jersey for a year. Then in my grandfather's house in Lakewood, Ohio. We lived in the attic. I refer to those as my Anne Frank years. \\n\\nC. H.: How long did that last?\\n\\nT. G.: I don't remember. A couple of years. We'd rent out this little house we had in the Valley and go back East. We were always driving across the country in a station wagon -- my mother and my brothers and I -- reading Burma Shave signs. It became a way of life.\\n\\nC. H.: What is that line in \\"Good and Evil\\" about your character being left out in the yard?\\n\\nT. G.: Oh, yeah. \\"You got a terrible rash and nobody wanted to touch you, so we left you out in the yard for a couple of years. After that you became bitter.\\"\\n\\nC. H.: When she took you back East did she always leave?\\n\\nT. G.: Sometimes she would stay with us. One time she left us alone in the house in the Valley, and the neighbors took care of us. I don't remember who fed us.\\n\\nC. H.: How old were you?\\n\\nT. G.: I don't know, maybe 7. My mother would say to us, \\"Whatever you do, don't go on the roof.\\" She'd drive out of the driveway and we'd go right up on that roof. Climb up the little trellis, and there we were.\\n\\nMaybe my brother took care of us. He's a doctor now. It was good to be independent, we learned to take care of ourselves. Also, whatever we wanted to do, play bassoon or take guitar lessons, we had to wangle some kind of scholarship. Rake leaves. I took piano lessons from a woman who ate Sen Sen. I had my first recital.\\n\\nC. H.: I bet you liked that.\\n\\nT. G.: I got a little taste.\\n\\n\\nThen she took dancing lessons and became an actual ballerina, but one day she was throwing water balloons out her window and decided she was not a ballerina after all, she was a prankster. Then she was on the chorus line, behind people like Ann-Margret. Then she decided she could \\n\\nbe \\n\\nAnn-Margret if she took acting lessons. She did some bit parts on TV. Her first film was \\"The Conversation\\" with Gene Hackman, then \\"Young Frankenstein.\\" Other big movies are \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\\" and \\"Tootsie,\\" for which she deserved an Academy Award.\\n\\n\\nC. H.: And now the White House. Bush has invited you to dinner twice. Tell me, Teri, what do you think of his politics?\\n\\nT. G.: Oh no, don't do this to me, it's not fair. I was very impressed with the silver and the china and the finger bowls. Somebody told Bush I was going to have a TV show. He said, \\"Our Teri?\\" I said \\"Yes, Mr. President, I made a touchdown.\\"\\n\\nC. H.: And what does that mean?\\n\\nT. G.: Nothing. I had no idea what I was saying. But I do know that I was at Bush's table and Stallone was at Quayle's. Do you think I should say anything about my relationships with men?\\n\\nC. H.: It's entirely up to you.\\n\\nT. G.: Maybe we shouldn't talk about men.\\n\\nC. H.: O.K., let's not.\\n\\nT. G.: O.K. then, we won't.\\n\\nC. H.: Fine.\\n\\nT. G.: I could tell a story though about when I was a little girl. My mom was working in the costume department at NBC and I would be with her at work. Her friend Wes, who did the same job, got a raise. I asked, \\"Why don't you get a raise, Mom?\\" She said, \\"Wes has a wife and child.\\" I said, \\"Mom, you have three children and no husband.\\" It was a big turning point for me. I remember thinking, I'm never in my life depending on men, no way.\\n\\n\\nAnd she hasn't.

Mr. Ambrose mentions in passing that German prisoners of war \\"were beaten, denied water, forced to live . . . without shelter, given inadequate food rations and inadequate medical care. Their mail was withheld.\\" But then he focuses only on the alleged food shortage. He doesn't address the other deprivations: were there also tent, blanket, clothing, medical and mailman shortages? There was certainly no water shortage","excerpt":"we were right on the Rhine, yet we denied the prisoners sufficient water. Maddened with thirst, some of them crawled under the wires and ran toward the river in open fields in broad daylight while American guards machine-gunned them.

When I threw some of my surplus rations over the wires to them, I was threatened with imprisonment.

The Walt Disney Company surprised everybody by announcing on Monday that it would buy Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion, in what would be the second-largest takeover ever. Then on Tuesday, in a deal that surprised almost no one, Westinghouse said it would buy CBS for $5.4 billion. Of course, all eyes then turned to NBC, like, \\"Isn't it your turn on Wednesday?\\" NBC's president, Robert C. Wright, jokingly said, \\"We're the small guy just trying to make it in the business,\\" but then acknowledged that he received \\"a lot of phone calls this week\\" from interested companies. As they say in the television business, stay tuned. Technology Is This Goodbye to OS/2? There is MS-DOS, there is Microsoft Windows. There is even the Apple Macintosh operating system. But of the software that runs personal computers, there had barely been I.B.M.'s OS/2. While Microsoft's operating system software controlled about 76 percent of the market in 1994 and the Macintosh 12 percent, I.B.M.'s OS/2 had 5 percent. Analysts have been predicting that I.B.M. would stop development of the software in January. Louis V. Gerstner, I.B.M.'s chief executive, didn't confirm that last week, but appeared to concede the battle to Microsoft. Obsessing about operating systems, he told a meeting of analysts, is \\"fighting the last war,\\" adding later, that it is \\"too late to go after the desktop.\\" A fact that was probably obvious to most of the analysts in the audience years ago. Trade O.K., Stop All This 'Nice' Talk Sometimes speaking sensibly doesn't pay. Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, learned that last week after he made a speech in Tokyo calling for the United States and Japan to basically be nicer to each other in trade negotiations. \\"A relationship between the world's two biggest trading nations that is characterized by one trade confrontation after another seems as anachronistic as the old gunboat diplomacy,\\" he said. The Japanese reacted cautiously, saying, \\"I don't think this is official U.S. policy.\\" Good call. The next day, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said his aide was not speaking for the Administration. \\"All of us at the Commerce Department, Jeff included,\\" Mr. Brown said, \\"ought to have absolutely unassailable credibility on the Japan issue","excerpt":"we were the tough guys.\\" Sounds like the days of \\"Speak softly and carry a big stick\\" are over. Currency A Boost for the Dollar At least the Americans and the Japanese are doing something together. On Wednesday, they jointly sold about $1 billion worth of yen in an attempt to strengthen the dollar. The Japanese also moved to change the rules on overseas investments that will make it easier for institutions to invest abroad. All this action sent the dollar up 3.3 percent, pushing it above 90 yen for the first time in more than four months. And Administration officials did nothing to discourage traders from speculating that the United States would intervene again. As Mr. Garten was trying to say, a little cooperation goes a long way. Airlines F.A.A. Grounds an Airline You don't have to sit around a campfire at midnight to hear scary stories. The F.A.A. last week grounded Markair, a small airline in Denver that serves such cities as Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. It carries about 4,000 passengers a day. At least it used to. The F.A.A. claims that the airline left several key positions vacant, including its manager of maintenance control, manager of maintenance and chief inspector. The company's vice president of operations is also serving as vice president of maintenance, \\"a split of duties which does not permit him to devote adequate attention to the responsibilities of the latter position.\\" The F.A.A. also said the company \\"failed to track and act upon information pertaining to the mechanical performance of its aircraft, engines and aircraft components.\\" Scared yet? The F.A.A. obviously was.  Telecommunications Earnings Up, Employees Down Your company has just reported that its quarterly earnings jumped 21 percent. The growth in sales of its main product outpaced any of its rivals. Life is good. Not at MCI, where they want life to get much better. Along with all that good news, the long-distance telephone company on Wednesday also announced a major restructuring. It will dismiss 2,500 to 3,000 employees by the end of the year, write off obsolete assets and possibly issue special classes of stock tied to parts of its business. Analysts said MCI wanted to make its stock more attractive. It rose 62.5 cents on Wednesday, but then fell 50 cents on Thursday and barely moved on Friday. Wonder what the company has up its sleeve next? Corporations Why Not White Plains? Prodigy Services was all set to move its headquarters from relatively quiet White Plains to hip Manhattan. Then on Wednesday, the on-line computer services company said it would remain in White Plains, but would open a 50-person office in Manhattan. Why? The company says the larger move would have been disruptive. Analysts had a more intriguing reason. They said there was a struggle between longtime executives who are wary of radical change and newer executives who see a Manhattan move as a way to help the company appeal to a younger crowd. The New York office was seen as a compromise. Prodigy is owned by Sears and I.B.M. Sears moved most of its employees out of bustling downtown Chicago a few years ago and set them up in a nearby suburb out on the prairie. I.B.M. is headquartered in Armonk. Looks like those youngsters at Prodigy better get used to White Plains. Appliances If I Only Had a Brain Just what we need, a refrigerator that's smarter than we are. Refrigerators have had a reputation for being dumb. Electronically, even a doorbell is considered smarter, which in the world of appliances must be the ultimate put-down. The Whirlpool Corporation and Amana Refrigeration are now making refrigerators equipped with microprocessors that tell these former dumb boxes when to defrost. Another company is also coming out with a computerized timer that will shift the defrosting to nighttime when electric rates are cheaper. It'll almost be as if they had brains. Maybe now they'll be able to answer the puzzling refrigerator question: \\"Is it cold in here or is it just me?\\" DIARY"},{"year":"1994","title":"To the Editor: After reading about Kurt Strauss's experience with American Express dual-signature traveler's checks (Letters on Travel, May 15), I wanted to tell you about my experience in Italy in September 1992.

That was difficult to achieve, turning Hamlet's soliloquy into a Grouchoian shtick, but they did it. It took all the Senate's self-adoration and pomposity, all its arthritic 18th-century regulations and the talent to switch between treating them as biblical pronouncements and discarding them as garbage, all its loose-jointed ability to kneel before political pressure, all its tradition of talking bipartisanship while practicing gang warfare. There were brave senators, but as a body they marched to nowhere with a practiced rhythm not seen since the glory days of the Rockettes.    But of course they could not put together all by themselves this demonstration of simultaneously ducking, weaving and blabbering into the oblivion of evasion.     Performance and artistes were organized and put on stage by the majestic theatrical skills, by which he governs, of the man senators harrumph as William Jefferson Clinton.     You see, the whole Senate song-and-dance was a plot created by Bill William Jefferson after the House sent its act of indictment to the Senate for verdict.     Now, I have no reliable sources for this. I do not even have the spokesman sources tax-paid to pass on information to the public. (Now we in the press routinely allow spokesmen the anonymity that would have driven me into paroxysms of snarls when I was an editor.)    But I have something better -- my own brain.    Brain tells me that surely the senators could not have learned all those neat tricks themselves. Republican leaders must have been taught the idiocy of preventing some of the most important witnesses from testifying, even on tape -- like the Presidential secretary who could have cleared up the question as to how much he coached her about how he and Monica were never alone. Surely members of both parties could not have learned at their mamas' knees how to demand privacy of voting but rush to the corridor microphones to announce what they said and how they voted.     Certainly it was not Democratic genetics to renounce the ethical meaning of everything they had said about no man being above the law and all that jazz. Brain says only one man in the country had the theatrical genius to do all that, Bill W. J.    The man had similar hits before. In his Playbill listing are the bland baby-faced demonstrations of double-crossing the victims of human rights in China and Tibet and Africa, crossing the high wire between saying he would never send American troops into Bosnia and now keeping them there indefinitely, and the cool gall to give a long State of the Union barely mentioning Iraq or anything but a few cliches about other matters of foreign affairs. And then there is the Oscar of fighting legislation against religious persecution abroad while marching into church with his very own Bible every week. This man is good.     So for some weeks the Senate conducted what was neither a trial nor a hearing nor ''Entertainment Tonight.'' Oh, poor Chief Justice Rehnquist, how his stomach must have churned the while.    Then, hear ye, they became ready to decide that a President who risked the Presidency to scratch his itches on a junior employee, who lied and lied, who commanded a cover-up in what is generally known as obstruction of justice, was guilty of nothing.    But however Congress failed, it was President Clinton who did what he did and lied as he lied. It was he who put America through hell, not Congress.  Just as a Presidential kleptomaniac out of control, or a practicing drug addict, he risked the honor and stability of the Presidency.     But, no escape from it, the American majority did not want him punished, and goodness, the Senate cannot offend the majority, can it?    I do not think America would collapse, whatever the verdict. Mr. Clinton may break his promises about religious and secular human rights, and the fate of U.S. troops and security, but in the past couple of years my life and belief in America have been enriched by the number of Americans I hear from who will not forget.

Actually, he divides his attention between buffalo, who are going to be shot, and a group of six right-minded misfit rich kids who set out to save them. The kids, you see, are really like buffalo—a trapped and endangered species—and if they save the beasts they save themselves. I don't think I am being too subtle in making this point. The film makes it perhaps three dozen times, and the film is never too subtle.The kids all attend a Western riding camp (\\"Send Us a Boy","excerpt":"We'll Send You a Cowboy\\") where they share the misfits' bunk with an incredibly Yahoo counselor (Ken Swofford) who one day takes them to watch him help destroy a corral-full of superfluous buffalo. The kids are horrified. More buffalo will be killed in the future, and so the kids set out by horse, on foot, by stolen truck—to perform their defiant act of mercy. Throughout their mission of mercy they experience many crises, and for each crisis somebody has a flashback that explains him.One kid isn't loved by his mother; another is loved too much; a pair of brothers suffer from sibling rivalry; one boy's father pays him no attention, while another boy's father pays him so much attention that he gets flustered and messes up his bar mitzvah. Everybody's character is thus an open book, a text book, and this raises a problem that the film doesn't face—as opposed to all the Problems it is so eager to face.What would have happened if the kids weren't disturbed? Would they still have freed buffalo if their parents had loved them — and/or kept their proper distance? Or would they have adopted the monstrous callousness that the film sees as \\"normal\\"—without, however, doubting its normality? It seems reasonable to question the thesis of a thesis movie as feeble as this one. And although there is nothing else in Stanley Kramer's work to admire, I think it is worth pointing out that this time he also fails to deliver his standard humanitarian message.\\"Bless the Beasts & Children\\" misuses a number at Western settings, several stock items of adventure and suspense, and all of its actors. It is difficult to discuss performance in a film such as this, in which most resources remain basically untapped. But before the movie ended I came to dislike Barry Robins who played his role as the maniacal master sergeant of the group with more hoked-up emotion than seemed necessary. And I came to admire Bill Mumy, the long-haired laconic leader, who managed to suggest a certain subversive independence and a depth of personality the movie could never begin to fathom.

The foundation, which occupies houses and house trailers in the Bucks County countryside, places some of its patients in residence with families who provide continual supervision as a background for the specialized, and, I believe, controversial therapy practiced by the foundation's director, Dr. Albert Honig. The filmmaker, David Sawyer, and his photographer and co-director. Robert Elfstrom, spent a year and a half visiting the foundation, photographing five patients during a major part of their residence.Dr. Honig calls his approach \\"direct confrontation.\\" The doctor forces himself upon his patient's attention — arguing, yelling, bullying, embracing, wrestling. While the treatment pays full attention to psychological causes (everybody seems to have some kind of mother problem), direct assault is made upon the behavioral symptoms of the illness. Dr. Honig doesn't mind telling his patients what messes they are, and they respond in kind.Therapeutic sessions are highly dramatic, emotional, and sometimes violent. Dr. Honig is a large man who looks a little like Walter Matthau and sounds like a cross between Selma Diamond and Jackie Gleasonvangry. I assume he has a sense of humor. At least, when he sits—literally—on the stomach of a frail looking young woman and compassionately asks, \\"What can I do to help you, you poor thing?\\" the answer, if he's not kidding, is painfully self-evident.One effect of Dr. Honig's approach is that the patient finds himself forced into a kind of dialogue, a posture as if he were being interviewed by a very bright, insistent and none-too-friendly journalist. As a result, and in spite of all the mauling, there seems to exist between patient and therapist (Dr. Honig and his assistants) a sense of real equality. \\"We're not attacking the patient","excerpt":"we're attacking the irrationality,\\" Dr. Honig explains—and the method of attack and the rhetoric call to mind certain aspects of old-time religion.Most of the patients seem very intelligent (all of them must be backed by plenty of money), but one is retarded, and he also is given no quarter. Over the year and a half the patients change physically. One young man apparently achieves a superb recovery; another—equally promising—only succeeds with the suicide he had desired since the beginning.The intrusion of the camera and the filmmakers seem to disturb nobody (though it is never ignored). Few of the therapeutic sessions are private anyway. Obviously, Sawyer and Elfstrom were out to make a movie, and not just to record treatment. I think they have succeeded, but the movie is tactfully, perhaps necessarily, less interesting than its material. For the purposes of art, truth is always less real than fiction.

In the process of turning it into a film, the director, Irvin Willat, seems to have neglected to put a little drama into the various chapters of his work. In fact its sole claim to anything akin to distinction is the presence of Renée Adorée, who portrays a much-worried daughter of a trapper.In this offering villainy has the upper hand for a long while, for after the summary dismissal of one rogue another turns up to pester Jean DeBois and his daughter, Renée.Soon after the introduction of Renée, one realizes that she is inviting trouble by her pretty face. She shows Captain Blake, who owns a lugger, one of the pelts and he says that he will buy it at her price provided she gives him a kiss. Renée appears to be much more willing that the majority of screen heroines, for she agrees, and this gives Mr. Willat a chance to show a closeup of Renée's lips. And it looks as though Mr. Willat thought that this idea was brilliant, for he emphasizes it in other scenes of his film.Jean does a good job when he cracks the neck of Jacques Corbeau. But one gathers that Captain Blake does even a better job when he, with much difficulty or craftiness, forces Jean to admit that he killed Corbeau.Of course, all Captain Blake wants is to take Renée aboard the lugger. He says that he intends to marry her, but everybody knows she will never become Mrs. Blake.

In the New York region, he has competitors in Westchester County and Long Island, he said.\\n\\n Contracts are awarded by bids, ranging from lavish New York productions like \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" to a high school show. While noting that Broadway shows often budget 15 percent of their start-up costs for lighting, Mr. Stern said that even though most of his profit comes from such extravaganzas, it is important not to ignore the small jobs, because the youngster who rents one light may someday be the biggest lighting designer in the country.\\n\\n In competing for business, Mr. Stern said, \\"Believe me, we're walking a tightrope\\" among managers, who want to get the job done inexpensively; lighting designers, who want creativity but at a low price, and a show's stage electricians who look for equipment that is easy to operate.\\n\\n After a contract is awarded, the company is sent a blueprint with the total amount of equipment, like lamps, cable, dimmers and control consoles that will be needed. After Bash cleans and focuses the equipment and sometimes designs special effects, the show sends its own electricians to label each part for positioning in the theater.\\n\\n Bash's building houses thousands of lights and miles of cable, said Mr. Stern, noting that today's productions use about five times as much equipment as was needed 30 years ago, and it is much more sophisticated. Now, a three-foot computer board can operate hundreds of lights all over the theater.\\n\\n Despite the sophistication of today's equipment, the company's tasks require flexibility, too, Mr. Stern said. \\"You have to be prepared to change at a moment's notice,\\" he said, recalling the time that his company had set up lights for a news conference by President Ronald Reagan. But the President \\"came down another way,\\" had the equipment had to be moved hastily.\\n\\n \\"And you'd better have a backup generator standing by if the lights go down or if the place isn't equipped for enough power,\\" Mr. Stern said. \\"You might be doing an outdoor pageant like the Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the promoters want to know why you have to have all these units. Well, suppose it starts to rain, then what?\\"\\n\\n Mr. Stern, who is 55, has been running Bash for 19 years. He has a partner, Bobby Cannon, who manages operations. Mr. Stern says he sleeps no more than three hours a night and gets to the office by 6:30 every morning and stays late. He manages to squeeze in racquetball three nights a week, he said, and spends some weekends showing off his four vintage 1957 to 1959 Chevys in local car shows.\\n\\n Mr. Stern has a background as a stage electrician.\\n\\n \\"I was just starting college, majoring in accounting, when my father died,\\" he said. \\"He had been a stagehand, and my mother called the union and got me work as a journeyman electrician. I got $35 on my first day, which was a lot back then. It was a Burt Reynolds movie, and I remember him breaking something on his body that day while doing a stunt.\\"\\n\\n Mr. Stern promptly quit college and began a career backstage. Work was exciting, he said, and he got to travel all over the country. Every day brought something different, but eventually, working days, nights and holidays took a toll.\\n\\n \\"In 1975, I bought into Bash as a partner,\\" Mr. Stern said. \\"The original guys were ready to get out, and I wanted to settle down. After I was here, though, I found that a lot of inventory I thought I had in stock was just empty boxes. I went to everyone I knew to try to get business from them. I told them: 'I want an opportunity. Give me a shot.\\"'\\n\\n His perseverance paid off. Bash was hired to illuminate three Broadway shows, including \\"Oh! Calcutta!\\" The assignments took almost all the company's inventory, 600 lights. Yet that initial venture as almost the end of Bash lighting.\\n\\n \\"I'd severely underpriced the shows, now we had no products to rent out to anyone else, there was very little revenue, coming in, and I felt so bad I didn't sleep for three weeks,\\" Mr. Stern said. \\"It's not very nice to hope and pray that a show closes, but that's what I had to do. Luckily, two of them did. What a lesson to learn.\\"\\n\\n After that, Mr. Stern said, the company began to do well, growing 20 to 30 percent a year ever since. Bash employs a staff of 65 and will soon open a new branch in Chicago. But, Mr. Stern said, he will never depend entirely on the company's reputation in the industry.\\n\\n \\"My peers are on a top level, but the wheel keeps turning,\\" he said. \\"We have seminars here for designers and their young assistants and college kids from Bergen Community College and Montclair State College who want to learn about the business. We show them as much as they want, so we can make a difference with the next generation who will be running backstages. They say, 'Donny, how can I make this work?,' and I'm happy to tell them all I know.\\"\\n\\n Mr. Stern says he is not stagestruck at all, although he goes to all the openings.\\n\\n \\"I look to see how a show is lit,\\" Mr. Stern said. \\"In 'Sunset Boulvevard,' there is the two spin, giving the impression of a ripple effect in the water scene. That's what turns me on. I'm a gimmick man.\\" Across the River With Bright Lights"},{"year":"1969","title":"PORT WASHINGTON, L.

Secondly, impose a pre-existing-condition exclusion so they can say, Well, look, if you have that pre-existing condition, we can exclude you for that existing condition. Limit your lifetime benefits so that your protection runs out when you need it the most. They can cancel it and cancel your coverage when you get sick.   We've had several examples in the very recent weeks of employers for good companies that had their health care canceled for all of their employees because of the incidence of illness among just a few of their employees and just effectively canceled out within a two- or three-month period.   There's also the exclusion of any service from coverage, even a service that might turn out to be most important to you if someone in your family becomes seriously ill.   And no American is guaranteed choice.   And I think these following points are worthwhile to keep in mind:   If your employer doesn't offer a plan you like, you can be out of luck. And 84 percent of employers offer only one plan. Of the employers that make available health insurance to their employees, they provide one plan. Effectively, out of luck if you wanted an alternative choice. You take it or leave it.   Secondly, if your employer doesn't offer a plan that allows you to keep your family doctor, you're also out of luck. . . .   And the Dole plan is better than the status quo alternative, but it's still I don't believe good enough. The insurance companies can still impose pre-existing-condition limitations, they can sell you a policy that doesn't cover the service you may need the most . . . because policies aren't required to provide comprehensive coverage. STATEMENT BY SENATOR SMITH     My office has received thousands of phone calls and letters, more phone calls and letters, I think, than anything since I've been in the Congress, on the issue of health care reform. Both sides.    I hosted a statewide health care conference earlier this year, in April, that featured leading policy experts from every facet of the health care delivery system. There were doctors, and there were providers and nurses and patients and everyone who had in some way had an impact, or were impacted by any change in legislation in the health care industry. . . .    In addition to that, I have 10 counties in my state and I have held a town meeting in each of those counties. . . . We were there to directly hear from constituents regarding the issue of health care reform. And they spoke out. There were hundreds of them, in all of those town meetings, more than any ever attended any of my citizen forums on any issue. . . .   In short, I guess the fairest thing to say is I've heard New Hampshire speak to me, with me, on this issue. And overwhelmingly what they're saying is that they don't want the Government any more involved in health care than it is already involved now. In other words, less Government involvement.   I think there's a concern, unfortunately, that comes through as I listen to these constituents and providers, and all of those who are in any way affected by this pending legislation. There's a concern that the Government is going to do something to me on this issue.   I think that's coming through loud and clear, and it's a very valid concern: Rather than helping us, they're going to do something to me that may cost me my good quality health care.   And the polls, the national polls, which have changed dramatically from overwhelming support to what President Clinton had proposed to the opposite now, . . . show that Americans share the same feelings as those people in New Hampshire. So I don't think there's a great difference between the states, no matter what state you represent on this issue.    I believe that based on what I have heard, people that I've talked with, that most Americans would oppose not only the underlying finance bill, which is technically on the floor, but also the Clinton-Mitchell-Gephardt, or Clinton-Mitchell bill, as we have here. Fifty-three percent, according to the polls, worry that Congress will pass a plan that gives the Federal Government too much control. And that's a very valid concern. They're suspicious because Government has proven again and again that it's not efficient, it's not compassionate, it's not thrifty and therefore shouldn't be trying to provide for the health care needs of people, least of all health care.    If a mistake is made by a Government official in, perhaps, the administration of the I.R.S., or some other program -- post office, perhaps, late delivering the mail -- it's a problem, maybe, but it's a minor problem compared to some slip-up in the treatment of your health. STATEMENT BY SENATOR HATFIELD     What we're trying to do in Oregon is to provide everybody with standard, primary health care. We're not going to separate every Siamese twin born in Oregon","excerpt":"we're not going to guarantee, in essence, that everybody has the right to any medical procedure -- over 9,000 of them under Medicare alone. We have prioritized them.   People say, Oh, that's rationing health care. Well, we're rationing health care, yes, but we're doing that today under an economic face which is certainly discriminatory, far more discriminatory than saying to a person 80 years old, If you have a life expectancy added to your life by one year, are we going to engage in a very costly medical procedure as against covering 100 women with prenatal care? No. We can't afford to do it.   Now that gets down to where the real rubber hits the road in terms of having to make the tough decisions that somehow we're going to offer anyone any medical procedure or access to any medical procedure. That's the implication, because we've not addressed those thousands of medical procedures and we . . . have the attitude that any one of them -- and it's very, very clear -- any one of them would be open for anyone.   What Oregon has done is it focuses on the provision of preventive health care services and assesses an access to primary health care before serious health problems develop. Now, it looks at the effectiveness of treatment, it draws lines, as I say, to exclude payment of services that are not effective nor add to the individual's quality of life.   I think we have to face this reality in the national picture as well. STATEMENT BY SENATOR MITCHELL     I hope the American people will not be fooled by the rhetoric they're hearing here today. And I hope the American people will also think about the irony of these Republican senators getting up here day after day after day and denouncing Government health insurance and Government health care as bad for their constituents even as they benefit from it themselves as individuals and their families.    Every member of this Senate participates in the Government-run health insurance system that's available to all Federal employees. And the Government pays 72 percent of the cost of that health insurance for these Republican senators who are standing here telling their constituents that it's bad for the constituents even as they participate in it for themselves and their families.   You American taxpayers are paying through the Government, 72 percent of the cost of health insurance in a Government-organized health insurance system for the very Republican senators who are now telling you that you shouldn't want Government-run health insurance.    And you are entitled to ask yourselves if it is so bad for you, why is it so good for them and their families.   Has one of them stood up and said, \\"My constituents, Government health insurance is bad for you, and to prove how much I believe that statement, I'm going to voluntarily drop out of the Government insurance system. And I'm going to put my family in the same place where your family is.\\"   Have you heard one say that yet? No. And you're not likely to.    Now that's just the insurance. Now let's talk about direct care.   If one of these Republican senators doesn't feel well, if he gets a headache, or his stomach aches, he walks a few feet down the Capitol and he goes to the office of the Capitol physician, a Government employee. He is greeted by a clerk who is a Government employee, checked by a nurse who is a Government employee and then goes in to see the doctor, who is a Government employee.    If Government health care is so bad, why do these Republican senators insist on having it for themselves? And then if they get sick, if the doctor says, You've got to go to the hospital, they go to the Bethesda Naval Hospital, or the Walter Reed Army Hospital, Government hospitals. Well, my gosh, ask yourselves, Mr. and Mrs. America, If these Government facilities are so bad, why do these Republican senators want to go there themselves?   And it's not just senators. President Reagan and President Bush were in their capacities as President the most powerful men in the world. And they were independently wealthy, and they could have gone anywhere in the world when they got sick.   And where did they go? Why they went to these Government hospitals. And who can forget the photographs taken of them waving out the window to the public and the press in those Government hospitals?    Why, are you telling us that it's good enough for Presidents, but it's not good enough for ordinary Americans? STATEMENT BY SENATOR BRADLEY     The Senate's effort to reform the American system of health care has important consequences for all Americans. It will determine the availability and the extent of health care for each of us. It will determine in part how long our parents will live and how healthy our children will be.   As we debate this issue, let's remember what brought us here in the first place. We are not debating this issue by chance. There's a reason why we all speak of this effort as health care reform. In dozens of living rooms and conference halls, in emergency rooms of hospitals and on street corners, the message that I hear from the people of New Jersey is that we need reform.   Our current system is not working as it should; those who have health coverage are paying too much for it, and those without health coverage deserve it. . . .   What people want most is some control of escalating health care costs. What people fear the most is losing their health care if they change jobs or get laid off or lose a job because of a corporate bankruptcy.   What perplexes them as well, when they're confronted with all these escalating costs of health care, is the power of the insurance industry. Want coverage for your heart problem? The insurance company says no because it's a pre-existing condition. In other words, the insurance company will insure you for everything but the heart condition that is most likely to generate the health costs for your family.   In confronting skyrocketing health care costs, small business is left to the mercy of insurance companies. Small businesses have no leverage to negotiate with insurance companies. Too often they're presented with a take-it or leave-it choice that only offers exorbitant costs for health care coverage.   Each of us can enumerate countless occasions in our states when we've had interactions with small-business people who've simply said they can't afford to cover the workers in their particular small business, they can't afford to cover because they were told by the insurance company that it's $6,000 or $7,000 a person and they have no leverage to negotiate with the insurance company.   If you get open-heart surgery, the tab is $49,000. A Caesarean section birth, $7,500.   Remarkably, women of higher incomes have more Caesarean section births. I don't think that's related to a differential in the size of the birth canal; it's related to the ability to afford to pay.   And a visit to an orthopedist, $300 for the first visit, $175 for each visit after that.   Most people have become accustomed to good health care, even with these costs. The health care simply costs too much, more than it should cost.    When President Clinton proposed health care reform last year, none of us thought he was imagining the problem. There was consensus that we should act, we should do something. The political noise of the last 12 months aside, health care reform is as needed today as it was then. The families who need it are still here, in New Jersey and all of our states. The families that don't have the health care need it as much today as they did a year ago. All those of us who were paying health costs today are paying too much today, just as we were paying too much a year ago. . . .   It is the job of Government to protect the public health and welfare in the short and long term of its citizens.   How to do this in the area of health care is the essence of what this debate is all about. Our fundamental goal should be to enable a competitive health care marketplace to keep people healthy but take care of them when it does not.   By and large, America's health care system is an excellent system, but it does have a few glaring faults. We should block or undermine those elements that work in our current system. We should fix those areas that don't work, and in so doing, improve the overall system.   Recent trends suggest the health care markets are becoming more competitive and efficient. We can spur that process by insuring that insurance companies compete on price and quality, not on their ability to omit high-risk patients. Managed competition is beginning to bring better health care at lower prices to many Americans.

Eugene Melnyk, the chairman of Biovail Pharmaceuticals in Toronto, shares Mr. Sands's ambivalence. ''Owning a big boat,'' he groused, ''is like owning a second business.''    But help for both, and for others who can  live neither with their yachts nor without them, may be on the way. And it is coming from an unlikely source: Irwin L. Jacobs, the 1980's corporate raider known as ''Irv the Liquidator'' for his habit of acquiring ailing companies and playing musical chairs with the assets.    Well, perhaps it is not so unlikely. When the game ended, Mr. Jacobs's portfolio included a dozen boat manufacturers, including Hatteras, the high-end yacht maker in New Bern, N.C. With fewer opportunities for slicing and dicing corporations, he put his restless mind to marketing their products -- notably, the million-dollar-plus behemoths turned out by Hatteras.    ''When I asked people at boat shows why they didn't own yachts,'' Mr. Jacobs explained, ''price was an issue, but so was the hassle factor.''    Never one to run with the crowd -- he once installed a delicatessen in a boat showroom in Minnesota to increase foot traffic -- Mr. Jacobs went looking for an unconventional solution to both problems.    Hardly anybody wants to spend more than a few months a year aboard a yacht, he reasoned. And hardly anybody with realistic aspirations of owning an ocean-going trophy has the time or inclination to tend to the details of keeping it provisioned and shipshape.    The solution, perhaps inspired by the latest fashion in sales of private jets: Yachtscape, a partial-ownership program in which access to a super-luxe, fully equipped Hatteras yacht is divided into thirds, while a management company handles everything from providing the crews to catering the cocktail parties to finding the perfect beach for sunbathing in the buff.     Indeed, the managers' job is part mundane maintenance, part European-style concierge service in which no client's wish is beyond reach. ''We're not just selling a boat","excerpt":"we're selling a life style,'' said Mr. Jacobs, testing his sales pitch.    Yachtscape's first two fiberglass beauties from Hatteras, the 74-foot Courageous with five bedrooms and the 65-foot Vigilant with four, are now on the block. Each of the three shares in the Courageous costs $1 million, or a third of what a single owner would pay for the boat. For this, plus an annual fee of $259,000, each part-owner is entitled to six 14-day cruises annually, which would keep the boat in use a total of 36 weeks a year.    The remaining 113 days are reserved for maintenance, weather-related down time and the scheduling convenience of the owners. With this many days of slack, potential conflicts over the use of the yacht at holidays should be minimized, Mr. Jacobs says.    Paying operating fees that are more than $3,000 a day, the owners of Courageous will presumably expect a lot, and Yachtscape aims to exceed their expectations. Everything needed to operate the boat -- a crew of two and back-up personnel, insurance, dockage fees and full maintenance -- is included. ''If a critical part breaks while the boat is cruising the coast of Siberia, we'll have a replacement there within 24 hours,'' Mr. Jacobs said.    A tour of Courageous, docked recently at Manhattan's Chelsea Piers, confirmed that clients needn't fear for their comfort, either. The yacht is exceptionally well appointed, with glitzy bathrooms attached to every bedroom, satellite TV's and telephones scattered about the living quarters like coasters.     The decor is Beverly Hills contemporary, with surfaces covered in natural fibers, mirrors, Hatteras's signature blonde-maple paneling -- or, in the case of the galley counters, granite. An inflatable outboard runabout and a Sea-Doo personal watercraft grace the rear deck.    ''In short, everything is included except food and fuel,'' said Ralph Vick, the managing director of Yachtscape, who earned his spurs indulging the whims of the well-heeled while working for the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain.     Of course, the three owners of Courageous will be masters of their domain only for discrete periods of the year. But management will swim the last lap to minimize the sense of sharing. Each owner will have separate sets of bed and bath linens. Each owner's clothes and accessories will be stored between cruises. Yachtscape is even prepared to juggle crews among boats if a particular owner finds that the chemistry with the help is wrong.    Kenneth Cancellara, the general counsel of Biovail, is ''98 percent sure'' he will buy a share of Courageous and expects to use the boat with friends and family. Mr. Melnyk, who is close to signing on for his own piece of the yacht, will probably mix business with pleasure.     But Mr. Sands, the investment banker,  sees the boat primarily as a capitalist tool. ''We're constantly entertaining, bringing together securities issuers and institutional buyers,'' he said.    Indeed, Mr. Jacobs envisions a big corporate market for share ownership, with buyers using cruises to reward star employees and stroke clients. ''A yacht cruise is the ultimate perk,'' he said.    And what if the partial ownership experience sours -- or if an owner decides to renounce his wealth and enter a monastery? Yachtscape stands ready to buy back shares for half the purchase price after 35 months. Probably more relevant, it will serve as a broker, finding buyers for orphaned shares for a predetermined commission.    Mr. Jacobs does not expect it to come to that very often. Indeed, he is projecting sales of an extra 50 yachts a year -- Hatteras now builds about 100 -- to satisfy the new market. Some may be specially equipped for fishing, while others may tap into the lavish fantasies of latter-day King Farouks.    What is the biggest boat he is prepared to sell in pieces? If the demand is there, Mr. Jacobs said, Hatteras can provide 130-footers. The tentative price is $3 million for each of three shares, plus $455,000 annual maintenance. The line forms to the right.   A Yacht, All Yours, Part Time"},{"year":"1990","title":"Mike Tyson used a nonstop assault to knock out Alex Stewart in 2 minutes 27 seconds of the first round of a scheduled 10-round bout at the Convention Center here tonight.   Seconds into the match, Tyson knocked Stewart down with two right hands to the head. Stewart got to his feet at the count of 4 and took the mandatory 8 count from the referee, Frank Cappuccino.   Stewart's trainer, Edwin Viruet, shouted, \\"Hold him, hold him.\\" But Stewart couldn't restrain the raging Tyson.   Tyson then hit Stewart with a right to his head and Stewart was down again. This time, Stewart's right arm was on the ropes. Again he arose, up by the count of 5.   Tyson knocked him down a third time, with a left hook to the head. As the ringside physician climbed up the ring steps, Cappuccino called a halt to Tyson's brutal show of power. 'We're Back","excerpt":"We're Smoking'     \\"We're back; we're back,\\" shouted Don King, Tyson's promoter. \\"We're smoking.\\"   In winning, Tyson earned a reported $5 million. Stewart earned $500,000.   \\"I knew he's a dangerous fighter once he becomes warmed up, so I had to come out strong,\\" said Tyson, who added that he looked forward to fighting Donovan (Razor) Ruddock next \\"to show he isn't the baddest person in the world.\\"   \\"I didn't get off,\\" Stewart said. \\"He caught me early; that's all. I was missing a lot.\\"   Tyson, who weighed 217 3/4 pounds, is 39-1 with 35 knockouts. Stewart dropped to 26-2 with 26 knockouts.   Before the Tyson-Stweart bout, Julio Cesar Chavez retained his International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Council junior-welterweight titles when he stopped Kyung Duk Ahn of Jinjoo City, South Korea, at 2:14 of the third round of a scheduled 12-round title bout.   Chavez, who is from Culiacan, Mexico, knocked Ahn down three times in a bout whose outcome never was in doubt. After the first round, in which the champion appeared to be gauging his distance, Chavez went to work. He knocked Ahn down in the second round with a straight right hand to the head.   Ahn fell onto the seat of his trunks and rose by the count of eight. He took the mandatory eight count from the referee, Tony Perez, then held as Chavez sought to finish him off.   Chavez broke away and began raking Ahn's body with left hooks and then let the punches go to the other man's head. Ahn slumped to the canvas, more in escape, it seemed, than from the pain of a single blow. He got to his feet by the count of three and again took the mandatory eight.   As Chavez tracked him about the ring, Ahn fought back, throwing looping lefts and rights without doing any damage. In fact, a trace of a smile showed on Chavez's lips, apparent amusement at this show of courage from the challenger. Devastating Right     In the third round, Chavez floored Ahn again with a right hand. Ahn was up by the count of three, with a beaten expression on his face. He took a few steps toward his corner as Perez gave him the mandatory eight. Perez asked Ahn if he wanted to continue. Ahn shook his head, as if to say enough is enough. The referee then waved an end to the bout.   Chavez remained undefeated in 73 fights, 60 of which he has won by knockout. Ahn, who fought for the first time in the United States, now has a record of 29-2 with 13 knockouts. Each fought at a weight of 139 pounds. Ruddock Wins     Earlier in the evening, Ruddock, a heavyweight contender from Toronto, knocked out Mike Rouse at 2:37 of the first round of a scheduled 10-round bout.   Ruddock, expected to be the next opponent for Tyson, had no trouble disposing of Rouse, who is from Portsmouth, Va.   Rouse was knocked down for the first time with a left hook. He fell face forward, got up by the count of six and took the mandatory eight from the referee, Tony Orlando. Ruddock moved in to finish his opponent, who grabbed and clinched. Then Ruddock unloaded a short right hook against the side of Rouse's jaw. Again, Rouse fell face forward, and this time, he did not beat the count.   With his victory, Ruddock, who weighed 228 pounds, improved his record to 25-1-1 with 18 knockouts. Rouse, who also weighed 228 pounds, is now 14-6-1 with 6 knockouts. Brown Knocks Out O'Neal     In another bout, Simon Brown, the International Boxing Federation welterweight champion from Germantown, Md., knocked out Ozzie O'Neal in 1:53 of the first round of a nontitle 10-round bout.   O'Neal, who is from Youngstown, Ohio, was clearly outclassed. Brown knocked him down with a left hook early into the bout. O'Neal was up by the count of four and took the mandatory eight count from the referee, Frank Cappuccino. But Brown was relentless, pummeling his opponent until Cappuccino took mercy and stopped the bout with O'Neal slumped against the ropes.   Tyrell Biggs, a 1984 Olympic gold medalist from Philadelphia, won a lopsided unanimous 10-round decision over previously undefeated Rodolfo Marin of Puerto Rico. Biggs outboxed Marin, scoring repeatedly with a left jab that he turned into a hook often enough to leave Marin's right cheek discolored and swollen. Biggs bled from his nose for most of the bout, but he was never hurt by Marin. There were no knockdowns.   Lonnie Smith, a former World Boxing Council super-lightweight champion from Denver, knocked out Eduardo Valdez of Colombia at 2:36 of the second round of a scheduled 10-round bout.

Bush's news conference from the White House, as provided by CQ Transcriptions, Inc.BUSH: Before I take your questions, I'd like to discuss a couple subjects. First, I want to briefly mention that today we've released the actual budget numbers for the fiscal year that ended on September the 30th. These numbers show that we have now achieved our goal of cutting the federal budget deficit in half, and we've done it three years ahead of schedule. The budget numbers are proof that pro-growth economic policies work. By restraining spending in Washington and allowing Americans to keep more of what they earn, economy's creating jobs and reducing the deficit and making our nation a more prosperous nation for all our citizens. I'm going to talk about the pro-growth economic policies that helped bring about the dramatic reduction in the deficit this afternoon. And I'm going to remind our fellow citizens that good tax policy has a lot to do with keeping the economy strong, and therefore we'll continue to urge the Congress to make the tax cuts permanent. I also want to talk about the unfolding situation in North Korea. Earlier this week, the government of North Korea proclaimed to the world that it had conducted a successful nuclear test. The United States is working to confirm North Korea's claim, but this claim itself constitutes a threat to international peace and stability. In response to North Korea's actions, we're working with our partners in the region and the United Nations Security Council to ensure there are serious repercussions for the regime in Pyongyang. I've spoken with other world leaders, including Japan, China, South Korea and Russia. We all agree that there must be a strong Security Council resolution that will require North Korea to abide by its international commitments to dismantle its nuclear programs. This resolution should also specify a series of measures to prevent North Korea from exporting nuclear or missile technologies and prevent financial transactions or asset transfers that would help North Korea develop its nuclear missile capabilities. Last year, North Korea agreed to a path to a better future for its people in the six-party talks. September of last year, we had an agreement with North Korea. It came about in the form of what we call the six-party joint statement. It offered the prospect for normalized relations with both Japan and the United States. It talked about economic cooperation and energy trade and investment. In that joint statement, North Korea committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and to adhering to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to IAEA safeguards. They agreed. The United States affirmed that we have no nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. We affirmed that we have no intention of attacking North Korea. With its actions this week, North Korea has once again chosen to reject the prospect for a better future offered by the six-party joint statement. Instead, it has opted to raise tensions in the region. I'm pleased that the nations in the region are making clear to North Korea what is at stake. I thank China, South Korea, Japan and Russia for their strong statements of condemnation of North Korea's actions. Peace on the Korean Peninsula requires that these nations send a clear message to Pyongyang that its actions will not be tolerated. And I appreciate their leadership. The United States remains committed to diplomacy. The United States also reserves all options to defend our friends and our interests in the region against the threats from North Korea. So in response to North Korea's provocation, we will increase defense cooperation with our allies, including cooperation on ballistic missile defense to protect against North Korean aggression, and cooperation to prevent North Korea from exporting nuclear and missile technologies. Our goals remain clear: peace and security in Northeast Asia and a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. We will take the necessary actions to achieve these goals. We will work with the United Nations. We'll support our allies in the region. And together we will ensure that North Korea understands the consequences if it continues down its current path. I'd like to discus the latest developments in Iraq. This morning I just had a meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld and General George Casey, who's in town today. General Casey, as you know, is the top commander on the ground in Iraq. The brutality of Iraq's enemies has been on full display in recent days. Earlier this week, Deputy President Tariq al-Hashimi lost his brother, Major General Hashimi, when gunmen dressed in police uniforms broke into his house and shot him in the head. Only a few months ago, his sister and another brother were assassinated. On behalf of the United States, I express my heartfelt condolences to the al-Hashimi family. And we express our condolences to all those who have suffered at the hands of these brutal killers. The situation is difficult in Iraq, no question about it. The violence is being caused by a combination of terrorists, elements of former regime criminals and sectarian militias. Attacks and casualties has risen during the Ramadan period. A rise in violence has occurred every Ramadan period in the last three years. Attacks and casualties have also increased recently because our forces are confronting the enemy in Baghdad and in other parts of Iraq. The past weekend, U.S. and Iraqi forces engaged militias, or members of an illegal militia, during a mission to capture a high- value target. The reason I bring this up is that we're on the move","excerpt":"we're taking action; we're helping this young democracy succeed. The reasons we went after the illegal militia was to capture a man responsible for killing many innocent Iraqis, and we accomplished that mission. Our troops have increased their presence on the streets of Baghdad. Together with Iraqi forces, they're working to ensure that terrorists and death squads cannot intimidate the local population and operate murder rings. Amid the violence, important political developments are also taking place. The Iraqi legislature reached a compromise and set up a process for addressing the difficult issues of federalism and constitutional reform. In addition, the government of Prime Minister Maliki has taken three important steps to build confidence in his government and in the Iraqi security forces. First, Prime Minister Maliki announced a plan to bring together Sunni and Shia parties and stop sectarian violence. The prime minister's plan has received support from every major political group in Iraq, including some hard-line Sunni elements that chose not to join the unity government. Among the steps the prime minister announced is a new system of local and neighborhood committees, made up of both Sunni and Shia members, that will work directly with Iraqi security forces to resolve tensions and stop sectarian strife. Second, this past weekend Prime Minister Maliki met with tribal leaders from the Anbar Province. These tribal leaders told him they've had enough of the terrorists seeking to control the Sunni heartland, and they're ready to stand up and fight Al Qaida. The prime minister told them that he welcomed their support and would help them. Third, Prime Minister Maliki's government suspended the 8th Brigade, 2nd Division of the National Police after learning that this unit was not intervening to stop sectarian violence in and around Baghdad. This police brigade has been de-certified by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior. It's been removed from service. It's now being reviewed and re-trained. With this action, the Iraqi government's made clear it's not going to tolerate the infiltration of the Iraqi security forces by militias and sectarians interests. The reason I bring this up -- these examples up is that there's a political process that's going forward. And it's the combination of security and a political process that will enable the United States to achieve our objective, which is an Iraq that can govern itself, sustain itself, defend itself and be an ally in this war on terror. Iraq's government -- Iraq's democratic government is just four months old. Yet in the face of terrorist threats and sectarian violence, Iraq's new leaders are beginning to make tough choices. And as they make these tough decisions, we'll stand with them. We'll help them. It's in our interests that Iraq succeed. Look, I fully understand the American people are seeing unspeakable violence on their TV screens. These are tough times in Iraq. The enemy's doing everything within its power to destroy the government and to drive us out of the Middle East, starting with driving us out of Iraq before the mission is done. The stakes are high. As a matter of fact, they couldn't be higher. If we were to abandon that country before the Iraqis can defend their young democracy, the terrorists would take control of Iraq and establish a new safe haven from which to launch new attacks on America. How do I know that would happen? Because that's what the enemy has told us would happen. That's what they have said. And as commander in chief of the United States military, and as a person working to secure this country, I take the words of the enemy very seriously, and so should the American people. We can't tolerate a new terrorist state in the heart of the Middle East with large oil reserves that could be used to fund its radical ambitions or used to inflict economic damage on the West. By helping the Iraqis build a democracy -- an Iraqi-style democracy -- we will deal a major blow to terrorist and extremists, we'll bring hope to a troubled region, and we'll make this country more secure. With that, I'll take some questions, starting with Terry Hunt. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Democrats say that North Korea's reported test shows that your policy has been a failure; that you got bogged down in Iraq where there were no weapons of mass destruction while North Korea was moving ahead with the bomb. Is your administration to blame for letting North Korea get this far? BUSH: North Korea has been trying to acquire bombs and weapons for a long period of time -- long before I came into office. And it's a threat that we've got to take seriously. And we do, of course. In 1994, the government -- our government entered into a bilateral arrangement with the North Koreans that worked to make sure that they don't have the capacity to develop a bomb. And North Korea agreed that there would be no program whatsoever toward the development of a weapon. And yet we came into office and discovered that they were developing a program, unbeknownst to the folks with whom they signed the agreement, the United States government. And we confronted them with that evidence, and they admitted it was true, and then left the agreement that they had signed with the U.S. government. And my point -- and then, as I mentioned in my opening statement, we once again had North Korea at the table, this time with other parties at the table. And they agreed once again through this statement, as a result of the six-party talks, to verifiably show that they weren't advancing a nuclear weapons program. And they chose again to leave. And my point to you is that it's the intransigence of the North Korean leader that speaks volumes about the process. It is his unwillingness to choose a way forward for this country -- a better way forward for his country. It is his decisions. And what's changed since then is that we now have other parties at the table who have made it clear to North Korea that they share the same goals of the United States, which is a nuclear-weapons-free peninsula. The -- you know, I -- obviously I'm listening very carefully to this debate. I can remember the time when it was said that, The Bush administration goes it alone too often in the world, which I always thought was a bogus claim to begin with. And now all of a sudden, people are saying, you know, The Bush administration ought to be going it alone with North Korea. But it didn't work in the past, is my point. The strategy did not work. I learned a lesson from that and decided that the best way to convince Kim Jong Il to change his mind on a nuclear weapons program is to have others send the same message. And so in my phone calls that I recently made right after the test I lamented the fact that he had tested to Hu Jintao and also lamented the fact that Hu Jintao had publicly asked him not to test. I talked to the South Korean president, and I said, It ought to be clear to us now that we must continue to work together to make it abundantly clear to the leader in North Korea that there's a better way forward; when he walks away from agreement he's not just walking away from the table with the United States as the only participant. He's walking away from a table that others are sitting at. And my point to you is: In order to solve this diplomatically, the United States and our partners must have a strong diplomatic hand. And you have a better diplomatic hand with others, sending the message, than you do when you're alone. And so, obviously, I made the decision that the bilateral negotiations wouldn't work. And the reason I made that decision is because they didn't. And we'll continue to work to come up with a diplomatic solution to North Korea. This is a serious issue. But I want to remind our fellow citizens that the North Korea issue was serious for years. And I'll also remind our citizens that we want to make sure that we solve this problem diplomatically. We've got to give every effort to do so. But in my discussions with our partners, I reassured them that the security agreements we have with them will be enforced, if need be. And that's in particular to South Korea and Japan. Senator Warner says Iraq appears to be drifting sideways. And James Baker says a change in strategy may be needed. QUESTION: Are you willing to acknowledge that a change may be needed? BUSH: We're constantly changing tactics to achieve a strategic goal. Our strategic goal is a country which can defend itself, sustain itself and govern itself. The strategic goal is to help this young democracy succeed in a world in which extremists are trying to intimidate rational people in order to topple moderate governments and to extend the caliphate. The stakes couldn't be any higher, as I said earlier, in the world in which we live. There are extreme elements that use religion to achieve objectives. And they want us to leave. And they want to topple government. They want to extend an ideological caliphate that has no concept of liberty inherent in their beliefs. They want to control oil resources and they want to plot and plan and attack us again. That's their objectives. And so -- and our strategic objective is to prevent them from doing that. And we're constantly changing tactics to achieve that objective. And I appreciate Senator Warner going over there and taking a look. I want you to notice what he did say is: If the plan is now not working, the plan that's in place isn't working, America needs to adjust. I completely agree. That's what I talked to General Casey about. I said: General, the Baghdad security plan is in its early implementation. I support you strongly but, if you come into this office and say we need to do something differently, I support you. If you need more troops, I support you. If you're going to devise a new strategy, we're with you. Because I trust General Casey to make the judgments necessary to put the tactics in place to help us achieve an objective. And I appreciate Jimmy Baker's willingness to -- he and Lee Hamilton are putting this -- they got a group they put together that -- I think it was Congressman Wolf's suggestion -- or passed into law. We supported the idea. I think it's good to have some of our elder statesmen -- I hate to call Baker an elder statesman -- but to go over there and take a look and to come back and make recommendations. Somebody said he said, Well, you know, cut-and-run isn't working. That's not our policy. Our policy is to help this country succeed, because I understand the stakes. And I'm going to repeat them one more time. As a matter of fact, I'm going to spend a lot of time repeating the stakes about what life is like in the Middle East. It is conceivable that there will be a world in which radical forms -- extreme forms of religion fight each other for influence in the Middle East; in which they've got the capacity to use oil as an economic weapon. And when you throw into that mix a nuclear weapon in the hands of a sworn enemy of the United States, you begin to see an environment that would cause some later on in history to look back and say, How come they couldn't see the problem? What happened to them in the year 2006? Why weren't they able to see the problems now and deal with them before it came too late? And so Iraq is an important part of dealing with this problem. And my vow to the American people is I understand the stakes, and I understand what it would mean for us to leave before the job is done. And I look forward to listening to how -- what Jimmy Baker and Lee Hamilton say about how to get the job done. I appreciate them working on this issue, because I think they understand what I know: The stakes are high. And the stakes are high when it comes to developing a Palestinian state so that Israel can live at peace. And the stakes are high when it comes to making sure the young democracy of Lebanon is able to fend off the extremists and radicals that want to crater that democracy. This is a real challenge of the 21st century. I like to tell people we're in an ideological struggle. And it's a struggle between extremists and radicals and people of moderation who want to simply live a peaceful life. And the calling of this country and in this century is whether or not we will help the forces of moderation prevail. That's the fundamental question facing the United States of America beyond my presidency. And you can tell I've made my choice. And I made my choice because the most solemn duty of the American president, in government, is to protect this country from harm. Martha -- I'm sure with a profound follow-up. QUESTION: Can we go back to North Korea, Mr. President? BUSH: Please. QUESTION: You talk about failures of the past administration with the policy toward North Korea. Again, how can you say your policy is more successful, given that North Korea has apparently tested a nuclear weapon? And also, if you wouldn't mind, what is the red line for North Korea, given what has happened over the past few months? BUSH: My point was: Bilateral negotiations didn't work. You know, I appreciate the efforts of previous administrations. It just didn't work. And, therefore, I thought it was important to change how we approached the problem so that we could solve it diplomatically. And I firmly believe that with North Korea -- and with Iran -- that it is best to deal with these regimes with more than one voice. Because I understand how it works. What ends up happening is that, you know, we say to a country such as North Korea, Here's a reasonable way forward. They try to extract more at the negotiating table or they've got a different objective. And then they go and say, Wait a minute; the United States is being unreasonable. They make a threat. They could -- you know, they say the world is about to fall apart because of the United States's problem. And, all of a sudden, we become the issue. But the United States' message to North Korea and Iran and the people in both countries is that we have -- we want to solve the issues peacefully. We said: There's a better way forward for you. Here's a chance, for example, to help your country economically. And all you got to do is verifiably show that you're -- in Iran's cases, that you've suspended your weapons program; in North Korea's case, that you've got international safeguards on your program. Which they agreed to, by the way. And so my point is that, to the American people, I say: Look, we want to solve this diplomatically. It's important for the president to say to the American people: Diplomacy was what is our first choice. And I've now outlined a strategy. And I think it is a hopeful sign that China is now an integral partner in helping North Korea understand that it's just not the United States speaking to them. And it's an important sign to North Korea that South Korea -- a country which obviously is deeply concerned about North Korean activities -- South Korea is a partner. If North Korea decides that, you know, they don't like what's being said, they're not just stiffing the United States -- I don't know if that's a diplomatic word or not -- but they're sending a message to countries in the neighborhood that they really don't care what other countries think, which leads to further isolation. And when we get a U.N. Security Council resolution, it will help us deal with issues like proliferation and his ability -- he, being Kim Jong Il's ability to attract money to continue to develop his program. QUESTION: What about the red line, sir? BUSH: Well, the world has made it clear that these tests caused us to come together and work in the United Nations to send a clear message to the North Korean regime. We're bound up together with a common strategy to solve this issue peacefully, through diplomatic means. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. BUSH: If I might say, that is a beautiful suit. QUESTION: Thank you, sir. My tailor appreciates that. BUSH: And I can't see anybody else who even comes close. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: Thank you very much. I'll be happy to pass along my tailor's number... (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ... if you'd like that, sir. BUSH: I'll take that back. I will recognize that -- please? QUESTION: On May 23rd, 2003, sir, you said -- you effectively drew a line in the sand. You said, We will not tolerate a nuclear North Korea. And, yet, now it appears that they have crossed that line. And I'm wondering what now, sir, do you say to both the American people and the international community vis-a-vis what has happened over the last 48 hours? BUSH: No, I appreciate that. And I think it's very important for the American people and North Korea to understand that that statement still stands. And one way to make sure that we're able to achieve our objective is to have other people join us in making it clear to North Korea that they share that objective. And that's what's changed. That's what changed over a relatively quick period of time. It used to be that the United States would say that, and that would be kind of a stand-alone statement. Now, when that statement is said, there are other nations in the neighborhood saying it. And so we'll give diplomacy a chance to work. It is very important for us to solve these problems diplomatically. And I thank the leaders of -- listen, when I call them on the phone, we're strategizing. This isn't, you know: Oh, please stand up and say something. This is: How can we continue to work together to solve this problem? And that is a substantial change from the previous times. Suzanne, the second -- the first best-dressed person here. Sorry. QUESTION: Kevin and I coordinated. BUSH: Yes. No, actually it looks -- yeah. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. QUESTION: Back on Iraq, a group of American and Iraqi health officials today released a report saying that 655,000 Iraqis have died since the Iraq war. That figure is 20 times the figure that you cited in December at 30,000. Do you care to amend or update your figure? And do you consider this a credible report? BUSH: No, I don't consider it a credible report. Neither does General Casey and neither do Iraqi officials. I do -- I do know that a lot of innocent people have died, and that troubles me. And it grieves me. And I applaud the Iraqis for their courage in the face of violence. I am, you know, amazed that this is a society which so wants to be free that they're willing to -- you know, that there's a level of violence that they tolerate. And it's now time for the Iraqi government to work hard to bring security in neighborhoods so people can feel -- can feel, you know, at peace. No question it's violent. But this report is one -- they put it out before. It was pretty well -- the methodology is pretty well discredited. But I, you know, talk to people like General Casey. And, of course, the Iraqi government put out a statement talking about the report. QUESTION: So the figure's 30,000, Mr. President? Do you stand by your figure, 30,000? BUSH: I, you know, I stand by the figure a lot of innocent people have lost their life. 600,000 or whatever they guessed at is just, it's not credible. Thank you. QUESTION: Since you last held a news conference here in the Rose Garden about a month ago, Republicans across the country have seen races that were once safe tighten, with the tide turning, according to several polls, toward the Democrats. Understanding that you don't lead by looking at polls... BUSH: Thank you, sir. Thank you kindly. QUESTION: ... as you've said many times, are you still confident Republicans will hold the House and Senate? BUSH: Yes. I am. QUESTION: If so, why? And do you believe that the biggest drag on the Republican Party is the situation in Iraq? BUSH: I believe that the situation in Iraq is, no question, tough on the American psych -- like I said, I think, at this very spot, last time I faced the press corps. And it's serious business. Look, the American people want to know: Can we win? That's what they want to know. And we do we have a plan to win? There are some who say: Get out; it's not worth it. And those are some of the voices, by the way, in the Democrat Party. Certainly not all Democrats, but some of the loud voices in the party say: Get out. And so, no question, this is an issue. But so is the economy. And I believe there will be -- I still stand by my prediction we'll have a Republican speaker and Republican leader of the Senate. And the reason I say that is because I believe the two biggest issues in this campaign are, one, the economy -- and the economy is growing. The national unemployment rate is 4.6 percent.' We've just discovered, as the result of analyzing new data, that we added 6.6 million new jobs since August of 2003. Gas prices are down. Tax cuts are working. And there's a difference of opinion in the campaign about taxes. And we will keep them low. As a matter of fact, I would like to keep -- make the tax cuts we passed permanent. And the Democrats will raise taxes. Now, I know they say, Only on rich people, but that's, in my judgment, having been around here long enough to know, it's just codeword. They're going to raise them on whoever they can raise them on. And then, on security: The American people know that our biggest job is to protect this country from further attack. And -- because they know there's an enemy that still plots and plans, and there is. There is. Recently we learned that when British intelligence and U.S. intelligence, with our help, broke up a plot to get on airplanes and blow them up; the planes that were going to fly from Great Britain to here. And they want to know -- they, the people, want to know: What are we doing to protect them? There had been some votes on the floor of the Senate and the House that make it abundantly clear we just have a different view of the world. The vast majority of Democrats voted against a program that will enable us to interrogate high-valued detainees. That was the vote. It was wide open for everybody to see: Should a CIA program go forward or not go forward? A vast majority of Democrats in the House voted against a program that would have institutionalized the capacity for this government to listen to Al Qaida phone calls or Al Qaida affiliate phone calls coming from outside the country to inside the country. It's very important for our fellow citizens to recognize that I don't question anybody's patriotism. But I do question a strategy that says we can't give those on the front line of fighting terror the tools necessary to fight terror. I believe that in order to defend America we must take a threat seriously and defeat an enemy overseas so we don't have to face them here. I don't believe we can wait to respond after attack has occurred. And so I think these are the two biggest issues. And Iraq is a part of the war on terror. Now, I recognize Democrats say that's not the case. And what I say to the American people when I'm out there is all you got to do is listen to what Osama bin Laden says. Don't believe me that it's a part of the war on terror. Listen to the enemy, or listen to Mr. Zawahiri, the number two of Al Qaida; both of whom made it clear that Iraq is central in their plans. And I firmly believe that the American people understand that this is different from other war because in this war if we were to leave early, before the job is done, then the enemy will follow us here. And so I believe that we'll maintain control because we're on the right side of the economic issue and the security issue. Let's see. Yes, sir (inaudible). Welcome to the front row. QUESTION: Thank you. It's good to be here. Appreciate it. Following up on that answer, one of the things Democrats complain about is the way you portray their position... BUSH: Oh, really? QUESTION: ... in wanting to fight the war on terror. They would say you portray is as either they support exactly what you want to do or they want to do nothing. We hear it in some of your speeches. Is it fair to portray it to the American people that way? Well, I think it's fair to use the words of people in Congress or their votes. The vote was, on the Hamdan legislation: Do you want to continue a program that enabled us to interrogate folks or not? And all I was doing was reciting the votes. I would cite my opponent in the 2004 campaign, when he said there needs to be a date certain from which to withdraw from Iraq. I characterize that as cut and run, because I believe it is cut and run. In other words, I've been using either their votes or their words to characterize their positions. QUESTION: But they don't say, Cut and run. BUSH: Well, they may not use, Cut and run, but they say, Date certain, as to when to get out before the job is done; that is cut and run. You know, nobody's accused me of having a real sophisticated vocabulary; I understand that. And maybe their words are more sophisticated than mine. But when you pull out before the job is done, that's cut and run, as far as I'm concerned. And that's cut and run as far as most Americans are concerned. And so, yes, I'm going to continue reminding them of their words and their votes. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. My best suit's in the cleaners. BUSH: That's not even a suit. QUESTION: I know. (LAUGHTER) You got to give me more time in the morning with the news conference. BUSH: Yes, I know. You like to wake up about 8:30... (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: I want to ask you... BUSH: High-price news guys... QUESTION: Yes... (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: I want to ask you a little bit about -- I want to follow on the criticism that you have received, or the suggestions from Senator Warner and from James Baker... BUSH: Yes. QUESTION: ... and now Olympia Snowe. This is not exactly the board of directors for moveon.org. BUSH: That's true. QUESTION: Do you feel in some way that there is some shift going on in terms of the general support for the war in Iraq and your strategy, specifically? QUESTION: And do you ever feel like the walls are closing in on you, in terms of support for this? BUSH: I understand how hard it is. And I also understand the stakes. And let me go back to Senator Warner. Senator Warner said: If the plan isn't working, adjust. I agree completely. You know, I haven't seen Baker's report yet. But one of the things I'd remind you of is that I don't hear those people saying: Get out before the job is done. They're saying: Be flexible. And we are. I believe that, you know, you empower your generals to make the decisions -- the recommendations on what we do to win. You can't fight a war from Washington. In other words, you can't make the tactical decisions necessary to win. It just won't work. And I trust General Casey. I find him to be one of the really competent, decent guys. Let me finish, please, for a second. Plus, I couldn't hear you, but I saw you talking, anyway. I value his judgment. I value his -- I know he wants to succeed. And I value his objectivity. And he -- what's important for the president is when I open up that door in there and General Casey walks in, he feels confident to tell me what's on his mind. Here's what's going right and here's what's going wrong and here's what we're doing about it. And so for those folks saying make sure there's flexibility, I couldn't agree more with you. And I think the characterization of, you know, Stay the course, is about a quarter right. Stay the course means keep doing what you're doing. My attitude is, don't do what you're doing if it's not working; change. Stay the course also means don't leave before the job is done. We're going to get the job done in Iraq. And it's important that we do get the job done in Iraq. Defeat in Iraq will embolden an enemy. And I want to repeat to you the reality of the world in which we live. If we were to leave before the job is done, the enemy's coming after us. And most Americans -- back to your question -- understand we've got to defeat them there so we don't face them here. It's a different kind of war but, nevertheless, it is a war. And -- go ahead. QUESTION: I'm just wondering: Two months ago, Prime Minister Maliki was here and you talked about how we had to be nimble and facile in our approach. And my question is... BUSH: Yes. QUESTION: ... are we being nimble and facile in the right way? Is what General Casey telling you the most effective advice? Because it would seem that, in the two months since Prime Minister Maliki was here, things have only gotten more bloody in Iraq? BUSH: No question, Ramadan's here. No question, we're engaging the enemy more than we were before. And by the way, when you engage the enemy, it causes there to be more action and more kinetic action. And the fundamental question is: Do I get good advice from Casey? And the answer is: I believe I do. I believe I do. Yes? QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) Ramadan, sir? BUSH: Please. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke very passionately before about acting before it was too late on major issues. You faced one of those moments in early 2003. This was when the North Koreans had thrown out the international inspectors, said they were going to go ahead and turn their fuel into weapons. QUESTION: And you had a moment to tell them that they would face serious consequences if they were going to do that. You also had what may have been the last moment for any American president to destroy their fuel supplies while they were all in one place. BUSH: You mean bombing them? QUESTION: Whatever action you might have needed to take, including military action against the site, the one site at the time, where they were getting ready... BUSH: I just wanted to clarify. I'm sorry to interrupt you. QUESTION: Yes. And you chose not to. And I was wondering whether in retrospect you regret that decision at all, whether or not you think that because of the long history of deception that you pointed out before you should have acted differently. BUSH: I used the moment to continue my desire to convince others to become equity partners in the Korean issue -- North Korean issue -- because I obviously look at all options, all the time. And I felt like the best way to solve this problem would be through a diplomacy effort that was renewed and reinvigorated by having China and South Korea and Japan and Russia joining us in convincing Kim Jong Il there's a better way forward. And frankly, I was quite optimistic that we had succeeded last September when we had this joint statement, which you adequately covered. And -- and yet he walked away from it. He decided, well, maybe his word doesn't mean anything. And so we will continue to work diplomatically to solve the problem. That's what I owe the American people, to come up with a diplomatic solution. I also made it clear, and I will repeat, that we have security obligations in the region that I reconfirmed to our partners. Sir? Washington Post man. QUESTION: Good morning, Mr. President. BUSH: That would be Mike. QUESTION: Right. I'd like to follow up on a(n) earlier question about your rhetoric on Iran and North Korea. BUSH: OK. QUESTION: You said yesterday, in your statement, that the North Korean nuclear test was unacceptable. Your chief negotiator for the six-party talks said last week that North Korea has a choice, of either having weapons or having a future. When you spoke, a month or so ago, to the American Legion, you talked about Iran and said: There must be consequences for Iran's defiance and we must not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. I'm wondering, sir -- your administration has issued these kinds of warning pretty regularly over the last five years. And yet these countries have pursued their nuclear programs. I'm wondering: What is different about the current set of warnings? And do you think the administration -- our government runs the risk of looking feckless to world by issuing these kinds of warnings regularly without response from the countries? BUSH: That's a fair question. First of all, I am making it clear our policy hadn't changed. It's important for the folks to understand that we don't continually shift our goals based upon, you know, polls or whatever. See, I think clarity of purpose is very important to rally a diplomatic effort to solve the problem. And so I try to speak as clearly as I can and make sure there's no ambiguity in our position. I also found that's a pretty good way to help rally a diplomatic effort that I believe will more likely work. I know this sounds just saying it over and over again, but it's -- rhetoric and actions are all aimed at convincing others that they have an equal stake in whether or not these nations have a nuclear weapon, because I firmly believe that that is the best strategy to solve the problem. I mean, one has a stronger hand when there's more people playing your same cards. It is much easier for a nation to hear what I believe are legitimate demands if there's more than one voice speaking. And that's why we're doing what we're doing. And to answer your question as to whether or not the words will be empty, I would suggest that, quite the contrary, that we not only have spoken about the goals, but as a result of working together, our friends, Iran and North Korea are looking at a different diplomatic scenario. I thought you were going to ask the question, following up on Sanger: How come you don't use military action now? You kind of hinted it. You didn't say it. Now, and some wonder that. As a matter of fact, I'm asked questions around the country: Just go ahead and use the military. And my answer is is that I believe the commander in chief must try all diplomatic measures before we commit our military. And I believe the diplomacy is, you know, we're making progress when we've got others at the table, you know? I will ask myself a follow-up: If that's the case, why did you use military action in Iraq? (LAUGHTER) And the reason why is because we tried the diplomacy. Remember it? We tried resolution after resolution after resolution. All these, these -- these situations are, each of them, different and require a different response, a different effort to try to resolve this peacefully. And we'll continue to do so. The inability to convince people to move forward speaks volumes about them. It ought to say to all the world that we're dealing with people that maybe don't want peace -- which, in my judgment, in order for there to be peace requires an international response. It says volumes about a person who signs an agreement with one administration and signs an agreement or speaks about an agreement with another administration and it doesn't honor the agreement. It points up the fact that these are dangerous regimes and requires an international effort to work in concert. QUESTION: Thank you. I'd like to turn back to North Korea for a bit. You've said that bilateral talks didn't work. Secretary Baker has said that maybe they should be considered maybe at some point and under certain conditions. Are you prepared now to just take the possibility of one-on-one talks with North Korea off the table? BUSH: I'm saying as loud as I can and as clear as I can that there is a better way forward for North Korea and that we will work within the context of the six-party talks. People say: You don't talk to North Korea. Look, we had a representative -- a United States representative -- at the table in the six-party talks. The North Korean leader knows our position. It's easy to understand our position. There is a better way forward for his government. And people need to review the September '05 document. It's a joint statement that talked about economics and that, you know, we won't attack North Korea. We agreed that we shouldn't have nuclear weapons on the peninsula. I mean, there is a way forward for the leader of North Korea to choose. We've made our choice. And so has China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. And that's what's changed. I also am deeply concerned about the lives of the citizens in that country. I mean, there's -- and that's why I named an envoy, Jay Lefkowitz, to talk about the human condition inside of North Korea. And the reason we do that is we care about how people live, we care about people starving, we care about the fact that there are large concentration camps. You know, one of the most meaningful moments of my presidency came when a Japanese mother came to the Oval Office to talk about what it was like to have her daughter kidnapped by North Korea. You can imagine what that was like. It broke my heart. And it should break everybody's heart. But it speaks to the nature of the regime. And therefore we -- I am convinced that, to solve this diplomatically requires more than just America's voice. QUESTION: Mr. President, with growing numbers of House members and staffers saying that they knew of and told others about a problem with Mark Foley some years ago, has House Speaker Hastert lost touch within his own ranks? And has the scandal damaged Hastert's credibility and effectiveness in maintaining party control in the midterm elections? BUSH: No, I think the speaker's strong statements have made it clear to not only the party members, but to the country, that he wants to find out the facts. All of us want to find out the facts. I mean, this is disgusting behavior when a member of Congress betrays the trust of the Congress and a family that sent a young page up to serve in the Congress. I appreciated Speaker Hastert's strong declaration of his desire to get to the bottom of it. You know, we want to make sure what we understand what Republicans knew and what Democrats knew in order to find the facts. And I hope that happens sooner rather than later. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) BUSH: Oh, Denny's very credible as far as I'm concerned. And he's done a fine job as speaker, when he stands up and says: I want to know the truth. And I believe yesterday he said that if somebody on his staff, you know, didn't tell him the truth, they're gone. I respect that and appreciate that and believe him. I think the elections will be decided by security and the economy. I really do. I know this is -- this Foley issue bothers a lot of people, including me. But I think when they get in that booth, they're going to be thinking about, you know, how best to secure the country from attack, and, you know, how best to keep the economy growing. I think the last time I was out here with you I reminded you that I understand that the economy is always a salient issue in campaigns. We've had some experience with that in my family I think I said. I still believe the economy's an important issue, and I believe on this issue there is a huge difference of opinion. The other day, by the way, Don, I did bring up the words of the leader of the House when she said, \\"I love tax cuts,\\" and then, I reminded everybody that if she loved them so much, how come she voted against a lot of tax cuts. In other words -- again, back to your question about whether it's fair to use people's words -- I think to say, \\"I love tax cuts,\\" and then vote against tax cuts it's just -- it's worthy. It's worthy of people's consideration in the political process. I believe taxes are a big issue in the campaign. And I know how -- I know that how best to protect the country is a big issue, a really big issue. And, you know, there's just a kind of law enforcement mentality that says: Well, we'll respond after attack. It's not going to work. It's just not going to work. We've got to deal with these problems before they come to -- before they come to our territory. I understand that some are saying, Well, he's just trying to scare us. My job is to look at the intelligence and to -- and I'm going to tell you that there's an enemy out there that would like to do harm again to the United States, because we're in a war. And they have objectives. They want to -- they want to drive us out of parts of the world to establish a caliphate. It's what they have told us. And it's essential that we listen to the words of the enemy if we want to protect the American people. And in this debate about which party can handle it better, I will -- I think it's very important that no one question the patriotism or, you know, the loyalty to the country. There is a different mindset, however, that is worth discussing in the course of a campaign, and I'm going to continue to do it. And I believe those two issues will be the issue that drive the election. QUESTION: Thank you, sir. Mr. President, some in the national security community are wondering if, indeed, you are ready to live with a nuclear North Korea. BUSH: No. QUESTION: Well, they're saying that that is a possibility. BUSH: Well, they're wrong. QUESTION: Well, can I give you... BUSH: Well, it's a short question -- a short answer. I mean... QUESTION: One, China is not ready to put teeth behind sanctions, enough teeth to really threaten the regime, and also, economic sanctions have limited effect on North Korea. BUSH: Hmm. Yeah. We got to try it diplomatically first, April. And, you know, this is -- this is back to old Michael's question about am I serious about saying what I mean? And it's -- well, I say what I say because some people are beginning to wonder whether or not it's the goal. The goal is no nuclear weapon. And again, I think I've shared with you my views of diplomacy. Diplomacy is -- it's a -- it's a difficult process because everybody's interests aren't exactly the same. We share the same goal, but sometimes the internal issues, you know, are different from ours, and therefore it takes a while to get people on the same page, and it takes a while for people to get used to consequences. And so I wouldn't necessarily characterize these countries' positions as, you know, locked-in positions. We're constantly dialoguing with them to make sure that there is a common effort to send a clear message. And the other part of your question was? QUESTION: And the follow-up, yes. Military options -- there are a menu of options. The White House is saying once diplomacy has run its course and you've run through your timetable, what about military options against North Korea? BUSH: Well, diplomacy hasn't run its course, that's what I'm trying to explain to you -- a la the Sanger question. And we'll continue working to make sure we give diplomacy a full opportunity to succeed. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke of the troubles in Iraq. And as you know, we have Woodward and we have a shelf full of books about Iraq, and many of them claim that administration policies contributed to the difficulties there. So I'm wondering: Is there anything you wish you would have done different with regard to Iraq? BUSH: You know, speaking about books, somebody ought to add up the number of pages that have been written about my administration. There's a lot of books out there -- a lot. I don't know if I set the record or not, but I guess it means that I made some hard decisions and will continue to make hard decisions. And this is the -- this is about the fifth time I've been asked this type of question and, as you know, there are some things that I wish had happened differently. Abu Ghraib: I believe that really hurt us. It hurt us internationally. It kind of eased us off the moral high ground; we weren't a country that was capable of, one the one hand, promoting democracy and then treating people decently. Now the world is seeing that we've held those to account who did this. It's just a lot of look-backs. Presidents don't get to look back but, I will tell you, the decision to remove Saddam was the right decision. And I would look forward to the debate where people debate whether or not Saddam should still be in power. As you know, the leader in the Senate Intel Committee on -- I think it was CBS News, Axelrod; I'm not sure; you follow your news closely; you can verify this -- said that the world would be better if Saddam were in power. I strongly disagree. When it comes to that decision, which is the decision that caused a lot of people to write books, it's the right decision. And now the fundamental question is: Will this country help this young democracy succeed? And the answer is: We will. We'll change tactics when we need to change tactics to help this young democracy succeed. But the stakes are high if we were to leave. It means that we would hand over a part of the region to extremists and radicals who would glorify a victory over the United States and use it to become -- use it to recruit. It would give these people a chance to plot and plan and attack. It would give them resources from which to continue their efforts to spread their caliphate. The stakes are really high. QUESTION: On a different topic, you have said you will sign the border fence bill to build 700 miles of fence along the U.S. border, but DHS has said it prefers a virtual fence of sensors and cameras, rather than an actual wall. Will you -- are you committed to building the 700 miles of fence -- actual fencing? BUSH: Yeah, we're going to do both. We're just going to make sure that we build it in a spot where it works. I don't -- I don't -- DHS said they want a virtual wall. I don't believe that's the only thing they said. I think you might have truncated their statement, because we're actually building fence, and we're building double fence in particular areas where there is a high vulnerability for people being able to sneak in. You can't fence the entire border, but what you can do is you can use a combination of fencing and technology to make it easier for the Border Patrol to enforce our border. I happen to believe, however, that in order to make sure the border is fully secure, we need a guest worker program so people aren't sneaking in in the first place. And so I look forward to not only implementing that which Congress has funded in a way that says to folks, to the American people: We'll enforce our border. But I'm going to continue to campaign and work for a comprehensive bill so that whatever we do in terms of equipment and manpower works better. If somebody's not trying to sneak in to work -- in other words, coming through in a way where they're showing a temporary worker, you know, pass, where they're not using coyotes to smuggle across, where they're not, you know, going through tunnels -- it's going to make it much easier for us to do our job. And that's enforce the border. So I'm comfortable -- my judgment is people want this country secure. And we've got to do -- have a smart border, which we're in the process of developing now. It's a combination of fencing and technologies, UAVs, sensors. I don't know if you've ever been down there. But it's a pretty vast part of the country down there. It's hard to enforce that border. You got some rugged country. You've got stretches of territory where you don't even know where the border is. And you've got urban areas like El Paso or, you know, Southern California where people have been able to sneak in and -- by use of urban corridors. And so, therefore, fencing makes sense there. I went down to Arizona, the Arizona sector, and saw a place where there's literally neighbors abutting the border, and people would come -- you know, a hundred of them would rush across the border into a little subdivision and the Border Patrol would catch two or three and 97 would get in. And they're asking: What are you going to provide to help us do our job? And in this case, those who are in charge of coming up with the proper strategy to enforce the borders say we need double fencing with space so that the Border Patrol can use that fencing as leverage against people rushing into the country. And my only point to you is that the strategy to develop this border requires different assets based upon the conditions, based upon what the terrain looks like. And that's what we're doing. But I repeat to you: When you've got a situation where people are sneaking in to do jobs Americans aren't doing, it's also going to keep a strain on the border. And so therefore, a temporary worker plan, to me, makes sense. and it's a much more humane program -- approach, by the way. It will certainly help stamp out all these illegal characters that are exploiting human beings; you know, these coyotes that stuff people in the back of 18-wheelers for money. That's not in character with how this nation works. And I think we ought to -- I think a good program that helps us enforce our border also will see to it that people are treated more humanely. Thank you for your interest.

And one theory has it that advance orders of the Guns 'n' Roses albums are high because retail chains, which are buying on credit, see the album as a quick way to generate cash to pay off old debts.   \\"Business-wise it's been a tough year","excerpt":"we've had to really scrap for every sale,\\" said Mr. Garrett. \\"We think we have the potential to sell more than we've ever sold of anything. It will provide a ray of sunshine for everyone.\\"    Part of the pre-release excitement can be traced to a series of shrewd marketing ploys. The group has waited four years to release a new album; its last, \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" sold 14 million copies. The two \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums were originally scheduled for a May release, but Guns 'n' Roses refused to let them be issued then because, the company said, the band was not artistically satisfied with them. The delay fueled both publicity and anticipation. Also, a single from the album, \\"You Could Be Mine,\\" has been a big hit, thanks in large part to its being from the summer's biggest movie, \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\\"   \\"We just got out of the way,\\" said Robert Smith, head of marketing at Geffen. \\"When the record was delayed for a few months, the situation just grew in terms of consumer and retail interest. The band began gigging in May, and the marriage of the biggest movie of the summer and the biggest rock band built up incredible demand. When 800,000 cassette singles of 'You Could Be Mine,' went out the door, without any campaign, we realized that they're bigger than we ever thought.\\"    The record company has planned the release cleverly. Betting that teen-agers couldn't afford a double album that might have a list price near $30, they instead voted to split the release in two, with one album having 16 tracks and the other 14; the total amount of music comes out to nearly two and a half hours and the list price of each is $15.99. The first single, \\"Don't Cry,\\" can be found on both albums, but in different versions. And the company plans to push singles from alternating albums.    \\"You can't underestimate the label,\\" Mr. Garrett said of Geffen.  \\"They know how to make something big.\\"   But as much as any label tries, it is impossible to sell a dud. Guns 'n' Roses has clearly built a large constituency that is ready and waiting to buy its music.  Out of Africa    The pianist and composer Randy Weston, who is performing on Friday at Alice Tully Hall as part of Lincoln Center's jazz program and on Sunday in a free concert at the band shell in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, is one of the most imposing improvisers working in jazz. One of the New York-based be-bop musicians who came to prominence in the 1950's, he learned the lessons of Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, turning them into an amalgam of ringing chords, giant open spaces, percussive dissonances and skittering runs.    In 1961 Mr. Weston went to Africa, and his musical life changed. Since then, he has traveled through Africa extensively, living in Morocco and studying all sorts of different musical practices. Friday's show is partly a byproduct of his first trip. Mr. Weston and his orchestra will be re-creating the original music for his orchestral work and album, \\"Highlife,\\" which came out in 1963.    \\"A lot of African countries were just getting independence,\\" Mr. Weston said. \\"I wanted to do an album celebrating the events. I had spent a lot of time in Nigeria in a club owned by Bobby Benson, a drummer, and Fela and other African musicians would come and sit in and play. It was a great experience, so some of the tunes are about that scene. And I'll be doing some material off of a big band album I just recorded for Antilles.    \\"My interest in Africa had started even earlier, though,\\" said Mr. Weston. \\"It came out of my wonderful father. When I was a very little boy he had books about Africa, and he loved Marcus Garvey. He always said to me that Africa was the beginning of civilization. He instilled Africa in me, that we had a glorious history, that we were a global people. Since then I've tried to meet my brothers and sisters around the world. And he made me take piano lessons!\\"    Though Mr. Weston works with larger groups, he rarely performs with a big orchestra. The show will feature the arrangements and writing of Melba Liston, one of the best arrangers to come up in the 1950's. Ms. Liston and Mr. Weston have collaborated over the years -- they've just completed a new big band project -- and they work wonderfully together.    \\"I love working with a big band because you get all those extra colors and sounds,\\" said Mr. Weston. \\"And Melba is so so skillful she knows what I'm going to do before I do it. She can take my compositions and get the sounds that the pieces call for. I'm ceally thankful to her, and the incredible musicians who are playing this music.\\" The Pop Life; Just When You Thought Rock 'n' Roll Was Dead"},{"year":"1994","title":"Some calm reflection is needed about the baseball situation.

STATEMENT BY SENATOR ROCKEFELLER    We're all here to confront problems, not to pretend that they don't exist. We're all here to represent the people of our states as part of the same union, bound together as a nation. And now we have reached this moment when we confront a problem called health care in America. In our wake are years and years of speeches about the crisis of rising health care costs and diminishing health care coverage.                    . . .         We've reached out in terms of making alliances not mandatory but voluntary","excerpt":"we've stretched out the time line. If there is ever to be a mandate, it will never happen until the next century, and only then under certain circumstances, only if the Congress doesn't follow the orders of the commission.   We have reached out. But . . . this does have to be a two-way process. We cannot constantly be reaching out and out and more and more, and then nothing comes back. So it's very hard to reach agreement that way.    So here we are with our years of speeches about this crisis. This debate begins after, as you go over the years, I would say virtually thousands of hearings here in Congress, certainly tens of thousands of hearings. There've been public meetings at our homes and visits that all of us have had with people of our states, hundreds of reports, hundreds of studies and commissions, mountains. They fill cabinets in everyone's offices and in distant chambers somewhere in this complex, telling us some of the grim facts about health care in America. Emphasis on Realism    We have to be realistic. The Senator from Minnesota spoke about the fact that we let the market work. That's one of the compromises that Senator Mitchell has made in his bill, is to give more time for the market to work.   But I have to point out to my friends on the other side that the Department of Labor has recently indicated that workers who are insured, who have insurance through their jobs, that their number dropped from 66 percent to 61 percent over the last 10 years, and that the trend is downward under the voluntary system.   That means, Mr. President, that 5.5 million more working insured Americans are now uninsured. The market system works in different sectors in different ways. Does it work perfectly in health care? I'm afraid not.   At some point we have to draw on everything that we have learned from the experts, from our own constituents and from our own souls, and decide on the actual steps that will solve as much of the problem as we possibly can this year.    With the health care plan submitted by the majority leader, we now have that opportunity. This is a bill that tries to achieve the major goals of health care reform in ways that will work and that we can afford and that are fair.   The majority leader can only offer the rest of us the opportunity to act; he has no powers further than that. Then it's up to us.                    . . .         If too many senators treat this debate upcoming as only a chance to score points one against the other, one party against the other, their win is the American people's loss. If too many senators also stay stuck on the idea that we should hold off one more time, until next month or next year or the next election, their delay dashes the hopes of millions of Americans, many in my state, that are now thinking maybe, just maybe, something will soon happen here to help them with their health care nightmares. STATEMENT BY SENATOR KERREY    The question before us is whether or not we have the capacity to bridge the differences between Republicans and Democrats and pass a bill that is urgently needed by the people, urgently needed.                    . . .         There truly are people in America watching now, hoping that this debate gets interesting, and hoping that the debate, as a consequence of getting interesting, leads to a finished product, the enactment of legislation. The question before us is, Can we bridge the differences? . . .   It is true that we are dealing with a seventh of the U.S. economy. It is true that we are dealing with something that's life and death for the American people, and so we need to give it our full and serious consideration. We're prepared to do that. Demand for Care    Many of us, indeed I would say most of us, have spent a great deal of time studying this issue, a great deal of time at home looking at the problems that are there. It is, as the President said, bankrupting this country. There will be a $38 billion increase from last year to this year just in Federal spending for health care -- $38 billion. . . .   It is a tremendous amount of money, and the President of the U.S., when he started this thing, said it's bankrupting America, and it is bankrupting businesses and, increasingly, it's bankrupting families.   Why? Well, in part we're demanding expensive health care. Not very many of us walk in and say, \\"Could you give me the cheapest thing you've got.\\"                    . . .         We've gone from a point in 1950 where 80 percent of the bills were paid with cash; today, 80 percent is either socialized through the Government or it's socialized through insurance. Eighty percent have our health care bills paid for by someone else. And it's a consequence that most of us don't even know what the price is. And most of us in this body need to be reminded that, for tens of millions of Americans, even having a baby can be a financial catastrophe.   Mr. President, it costs $12,000 to have a baby in this city. Imagine that, $12,000. That's two-day normal vaginal delivery. Now the insurance companies only pay for a day. Two-day normal delivery, $12,000.   Mr. President, my babies were born 19 and 17 years ago, and I paid cash. I didn't have to be insured 20 years ago. Why? Because having a baby wasn't a financial catastrophe if you weren't insured.   We have driven increased demand into the system. In order to provide coverage for individuals, in order to reach out and help individuals pay the bills, we've driven increased demand into the system. The price goes up, the requirement for increased subsidies occurs as a consequence.                    . . .         There are tens of millions of Americans out there who do not have the capacity to pay the bills, who are forced to ingratiate themselves, to remain on welfare before they are told that they're eligible. All of us feel that there's a problem in America. We can see the gaps and differentials that separate Republicans and Democrats, and my sincere hope and prayer is that the momentum that seems to have stopped, that seems to have caused lots of us to say, \\"Well, I'm not sure we're going to get a bill\\" ----   I hope that we are able in a quiet moment to acquire the humility necessary to see that the American people are counting on us to set aside our differences and enact legislation this year. It is urgently needed. And we ought to do the best we can and get a bill to the President of the United States so that he can sign it on behalf of millions of Americans who are hoping and praying that we are able to get the job done.  STATEMENT BY SENATOR DOMENICI    I want to talk a little bit about health care reform and the Federal budget.   Now, why would I do that? Because essentially, whether we like it or not, we are going to be voting on legislation that has a big effect on our children and grandchildren in terms of the budget of the United States, whether we are still in enormous deficit position, whether we are still unable to pay our bills as a nation.   And thus, in a very real sense, the effect on the Federal budget of this plan -- and any major plan -- is of extreme importance, and we ought to try our best up front to understand.   It not so easy because we are sending new things to those who make the estimates all the time. Evidence of that today when every section in this bill has been changed, and yet we had some estimated costs in here the day before yesterday. . . . So we must be careful not to saddle our young people and to burden future generations with today's health care costs.                    . . .         There is no more compelling case for controlling health care costs than their current and projected impact on the Federal budget. Indeed, one of the most critical issues facing the country is continued growth of open-ended mandatory spending in the Federal budget. That is, you create a situation where a citizen is entitled as a matter of law to benefits and if you don't pay them, they can enforce it in a court of law. That's the definition of an entitlement. And this is led today by Medicare and Medicaid and the resulting growth in budget deficits. . . .   New Entitlements    These new entitlements will bring millions of Americans onto the Federal Government's subsidy program, and let me give you the best estimates I can there.   An estimated 100 million Americans will be eligible for Senator Mitchell's premium subsidies alone, not counting the long-term care, which is a new program with new beneficiaries, and other entitlements in this bill. I am not counting them; I am only counting the recipients of subsidies in whole or in part from insurance premiums.   And what's most alarming to me is the growth rate of these new entitlement programs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the new premium subsidy program will grow over 10 percent a year even after it is phased in.   So if we thought we had things under control and we're getting them there with new health care reform admittedly, right up front the Congressional Budget Office warns us that these subsidy programs will grow at a rate of 10 percent a year even after they are phased in. The Medicare drug benefit, a brand new one, grows at 10.5 percent a year even after phased in. The long-term-care program grows 44 percent a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office once it's in full effect.   So I don't think there can be any mistake about it: The Mitchell-Clinton bill, under the guise of health care reform, will create several new open-ended, runaway entitlement programs. STATEMENT BY SENATOR CHAFEE    I want to say I'm delighted we're moving into this health reform legislation this week. It's very complicated, but I think it's time for us to do the best we can do struggle for constructive changes that are going to help our citizens lead healthier lives. . . .   No American's going to remain untouched. It's going to affect how we're born, how we live, how we die. And this is far-reaching.   I think I just saw in the paper a note of a little child born in Pawtucket, Diana Rebello, Pawtucket, R.I., born on Sunday night, Aug. 7, in Women and Infants Hospital in Providence. Think of her life and what it means.   And then I think of Theresa Nigrelli of Westerly -- 100 years old, still stringing pearls every day at Nigrelli Jewelers. And she doesn't even need glasses. So we think of her, too.    And the financial aspects of this are mind-boggling. They've been touched on before, but I'd like to repeat: one-seventh of our economy in the United States of America is devoted to health care, one-fifth of the Federal budget. Of the five biggest items in the Federal budget -- Social Security, defense, interest on the debt, Medicare and Medicaid -- it's the last two that are going right off the chart, Medicare and Medicaid. Defense, banging along, going down. Social Security, fairly stable. Interest on the debt going up but not such a substantial amount. But it's the last two that are causing us our principal problem.    Now, the 1,410-page bill before us was only released a couple of days ago, and as I understand -- I'm not sure it's accurate -- I understand that changes are still being made to it. So it's up to us during this debate to air thoroughly for the American people what's in this proposed legislation and to insure that our actions don't make the situation any worse. Clearly we don't want to go backwards.                    . . .         Now we all know from study and vast experience and listening to witnesses much that's right and much that's wrong with our health care system. And we acknowledge that in many respects it's exemplary: in technology and innovation, the skill of our professionals and the range of choices.    But we also know there are several things that demand reform. And it seems to me very important to keep in mind, What are we trying to do? What's the endgame here? Goal of Security    And I think our objectives are three:   First, we must give Americans health security. We want to insure to hard-working people like Christopher North of North Smithfield, R.I., that he doesn't live in fear of losing his coverage. He, his wife and two sons were covered by his wife's policy through her employer. She lost her job. They applied for a new policy. They were turned down. Why? Because their son had a pre-existing condition. Minor though it might have been, it was enough for the insurance company to turn him down and thus their family's insurance down. . . .   But what about job lock? In other words, staying in a job you want to leave but you can't because if you go to the new place you won't be able to get insurance. Donald Bolster, Bristol, R.I., 13 years with Blue Cross. His wife suffers now from Parkinson's. No other insurance people, plan, will take them on because of a pre-existing condition. They can't shop for insurance coverage. They can't get an alternative plan. They don't have portability. They can't move to another job. That's what's known as job lock. Covering the Uninsured    The second objective: We must extend health insurance to those -- as many as we can -- who are not now covered. We want to make sure that the first group can keep their insurance; the second group we want to extend it to them. We know the statistics: 15 percent of Americans, 37 million Americans, at any one time without health insurance. In my state, it's 92,000 of our citizens -- 15,000 of them are, regrettably, children. Can't get, or don't have, health insurance.    Now who are these uninsured?    Many people have the impression that the uninsured are the poor or the elderly. That's no so. . . . The very poor have Medicaid; the elderly have Medicare.   Ironically, in our system, single-parent families are better-off in terms of health insurance than two-parent families. Single parent families are frequently on Medicaid. But two-family parents aren't. One of them's working and works for a company that doesn't provide it; the other, the wife, is at home or she's working in a firm where they don't provide the insurance likewise. Earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.   The vast majority of people without health insurance live in families in which the head of household is employed for at least some portion of the year. These aren't people who are the unemployed -- never getting a job. They're employed for at least some portion of the year.   In my state, 76 percent of the uninsured are in families in which the head of household works full time; 85 percent have incomes above the poverty level.   Now we all know it's very costly for society when individuals like these don't have health insurance. They're the ones that go into the emergency rooms of hospitals for treatments, for procedures that the hospital emergency room is not the right place. It's far too expensive for these individuals to be. Or else they don't go anywhere. And then the child or the individual, the parent, comes down with a devastating illness, that in the end costs our society far more. Controlling Costs    Now the third objective is to do something about controlling costs. Cost containment is the buzzword that's used.   The cost of health care in our society is getting tremendously expensive for the individual, for the companies, for states -- particularly through Medicaid -- and for our Federal Government.   In the United States as a whole we spend 14 percent of our gross domestic product on health care, more than any other industrial nation. The Federal Government spends 19 percent of its budget, nearly 20 percent, nearly one-fifth of all our expenditures on health care. And that's projected to go up to 25 percent by the end of the century. And local and state governments, particularly through the cost of Medicaid for state government, spend about 15 percent.   Now the country just cannot sustain these costs. You talk about what it's doing to businesses. The statistic is well known that there's a greater cost for health care involved in every automobile that's built by Chrysler and Ford, General Motors, more for health care than there is for the steel in the automobile. Twice as much we spend for health care in the United States per automobile worker per car than is spent in Japan.                    . . .         There should be a minimal level of Government intervention. Let's not replicate Medicare, which has been fine for the beneficiaries but a disaster in terms of cost containment. That's the ultimate of the micromanagement program. It's cumbersome; it's top-heavy with regulation. It produces a 12 percent annual growth in costs, which is more than double what the private sector's going up in.                    . . .         Now it seems to be we can begin to debate in earnest, taking up the bill produced by the distinguished majority leader, Senator Mitchell. He's worked hard to fuse the two bills in the Finance Committee and the Labor and Human Resources, which is a herculean effort. And I think we're indebted to Senator Mitchell for the effort he's made. Seeking a Consensus    Now there are a number of provisions in this that cause me great concern. And the Senator from Massachusetts says, Well, Dick, list them. But just don't attack the measure. Tell us specifically what you're talking about. . . .   Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe I don't read the legislation right. Maybe it's changed in the subsequent rewrite. I don't know. But the President and Senator Mitchell and others have indicated they're willing to give voluntary market solutions a try before imposing Government controls. In this bill in many areas in my judgment, that voluntary market solution effort has not been given the chance it deserves.                    . . .         The Mitchell bill, but for the employer mandate, appears to reflect few of the principles that those of us in the mainstream have: those of us erring on the side of less government intervention, more marketplace competition and effective cost containment. . . .   Does it mean we can't unite?    I believe we can unite.    Does it make sense for us to try for a bipartisan measure that keeps in mind the two objectives we all say we're for?   I think if you ask people out here what are they for, they'd all say two things: We want to increase the number of Americans who have health insurance with our goal of eventually covering everyone. Everybody would agree with that, I think, very few not.    And secondly, our objective is to get costs lower for individuals for companies for state governments and for the Federal Government. Cost containment.    Nearly all of us pay tribute to the effectiveness of the marketplace. We all seem to subscribe to the notion of competition. There'd be very few people get up on the floor of this Senate and say, \\"I don't believe in competition. I don't believe in the effectiveness of the marketplace.\\"   We subscribe to the notion of competition, those of us in the mainstream. We're for the most part extremely skeptical of government intervention. So why can't we unite behind a bill that incorporates those beliefs? . . . 'What an Opportunity'    I and all the other members of the mainstream group want to see good health care reform enacted this year. We'll do all we can to be helpful. We believe it's extremely important to have a bill with broad support.   What am I talking about? 75 or 80 votes in favor. That's not an impossibility. Rather than a measure that sneaks through, 51 or 52.    Time is getting short, but there still remains time to produce a product that will be of great benefit to millions of Americans.    What an opportunity! What a wonderful opportunity!    So let's not let it slip through our grasp.

His understudy, Morgan Spector, who has been standing in since Jan. 7, will take over the role. Rodolpho is an Italian immigrant who has entered the United States illegally and draws the ire of Eddie Carbone (played by Liev Schrieber) for courting his niece (Scarlett Johansson). While Mr. Fontana initially was believed to have been injured in a boxing scene between Rodolpho and Eddie, people involved with the production now say that he suffered the injury in another scene over New Year’s weekend. In the statement, Mr. Fontana said, “Knowing that I would not be fully recovered and able to return until after opening, I’ve chosen to withdraw with great respect to my fellow actors and to my own health.” Gregory Mosher, the director, said in the statement: “Santino is a wonderful actor","excerpt":"we’ll miss him, and we are tremendously grateful for his selflessness in this difficult situation.

It has an oddly woven plot, which begins innocently enough with grapefruits and strawberries and closes with the inevitable embrace. In between runs a nightmare, lasting 58 minutes, which has a jerky theme and is illogical and uninteresting.The mystery of two murders, with the same victim doomed twice, for no apparent reason, creates little of the promised thrills and leaves none in its wake. Contrary to detective story traditions, the characters look innocent but insist upon pleading guilty.In the middle the fragile plot-balloon collapses just to be blown up again, this time producing conspirators, infernal mechanism and a dread assignment for the hero to kill or die. As anticipated, however, he escapes with the heroine, but only to find, as did the audience, that the game wasn't worth the candle.Poor photography further detracted from the picture. The lifeless, unconvincing acting of the cast may be due partly to the unplausible situations they had to portray. \\"SECOND STORY MURDER.\\"","excerpt":"Weak Mystery Film Carricature Is Flat and Uninteresting."},{"year":"1951","title":"Controlled Materials Plan discussed CONTROIS ARE SLOWLY TIGHTENING ON ECONOMY","excerpt":"Weak Now, They Are Being Prepared To Meet Next Inflationary Phase PRICES WAGES FISCAL AND MONETARY ALLOCATIONS THE OUTLOOK"},{"year":"1945","title":"Topics of The Times","excerpt":"Weak of Faith Surprise Is Not Surprising Monopoly of Virtue Glad to Learn Ins Are Outs Leaders Borrow Programs"},{"year":"1926","title":"Vs Carroll IOWA BEATS CARROLL, 21-0.","excerpt":"Weak Offense in First Period Is Improved -- Collegians' Passes Fail."},{"year":"1995","title":"Just a week ago, Penn State had scored so effortlessly and frequently against Rutgers as to be accused of deliberate excess.

But summer in the city offers its own special joys and pains. So, although there are many things that most people know about surviving the summer, here are a few creative and practical tips and tidbits to tuck away for the sultry season. \\n\\n PITY the dog or cat left in a New York apartment with no air conditioning. Here's help for keeping them cool. The A.S.P.C.A. suggests freezing a bowl of water overnight and leaving it out for the pet to lick all day. Also, keep drapes drawn and place a fan where the pet can't knock it over or chew on the wire.\\nBEING A COOL CONSUMER \\n\\n NOT everyone can afford even a low-priced, new air-conditioner. But before you buy a used one, Jim Nanni, a spokesman for Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports, suggests some simple checks. Listen to it; weird sounds spell trouble. Check visible coils for corrosion, dirt or damage. Look for the manufacturer's label (sometimes inside the front plastic cover) for a manufacturing date and power capabilities. Use a thermometer to check the air-flow temperature; adding freon can be expensive. And a professional once-over is a good idea.\\nTHE THRILL OF GRILLING \\n\\n WITHOUT a backyard, barbecuing in the city can be tricky. Tar roofs and open barbecue flames do not mix, says Firefighter Francis J. McCabe, a Fire Department spokesman. Terrace barbecuing should be done at least 10 feet from the entrance to a room. Keep a fire extinguisher handy. Using hibachis inside apartments is not wise, he says, because the flame is not as controllable as that on a gas stove. As for wide-open spaces, forget Central Park. The city parks that do allow barbecuing are: Fort Washington Park and Randall's Island in Manhattan; Alley Pond Park, Cunningham Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Forest Park and Rockaway Beach in Queens; Prospect Park and Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn; Crotona Park, the Alan Shandler Recreation Area of Van Cortlandt Park, and sections of Orchard Beach, which is the southern section of Pelham Bay Park, in the Bronx, and Clove Lakes and Willow Brook Park on Staten Island.\\nEYE-SAVING DEVICES \\n\\n SUNGLASSES alert: \\"Darker sunglasses can actually be harmful, because the pupil is fooled into dilating by the dim light, and this allows U.V. rays to enter freely,\\" warns Dr. Jack Jeffers, a spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Radiation from those rays, as everyone has often been warned, can cause melanomas (of the skin and eye), heighten cataract development and increase chances of vision loss with age. Dr. Jeffers suggests having ultraviolet protection built into clear eyeglass lenses and to buy only those dark sunglasses that are labeled as offering 99 to 100 percent protection. \\nGETTING THE STAR TREATMENT \\n\\n ADMIT it. Tourists aren't the only ones who yearn to see the inside of some of the city's toniest restaurants. So for John and Jane Q. Citizen who have considered haute cuisine when takeout Chinese was not enough, a few guidelines. Balmy Friday nights can be a great time to try dining at a celebrity-hot place. \\"If it's nice out,\\" says Bill Gilroy, owner of Match in SoHo, the trendsetters \\"leave town and forget to cancel.\\" If it rains, though, forget it. To avoid summer tourists at hot spots, consider an early dinner. European tourists, especially, tend to eat later. Best time: 7:30 P.M. The best day to recline at a power-lunch table in summer? \\"Monday,\\" says Sirio Maccione, owner of Le Cirque, on the East Side. \\"Many customers who go away for weekends stay until Monday.\\"\\nOUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR \\n\\n FOR anyone who imagines that those trips to the refrigerator for something cold will also help cool off the kitchen, a warning: \\"Each time the door opens, the motor has to generate a termendous amount of energy, which actually heats up your kitchen,\\" says Jim Samuels, a spokesman for Sears. And anyway, it is hot drinks, like tea, that actually help make the drinker feel cooler, says Sabine Cassel, a New York-based food writer. For sunburn sufferers, the refrigerator can be a summer medicine cabinet. \\"Take a bath with two quarts of milk or with orange sections, apply compresses of vinegar on your face and body, and try facial masks of sour cream and mashed strawberries or egg white,\\" advises Lia Schorr, a local skin-care salon owner and author. \\"Plain yogurt,\\" advises Dorit Baxter, another skin-care salon owner.\\nBUGS, BITES AND STUFF \\n\\n SOME good news about Lyme disease. \\"The Department of Health annually conducts surveys of tick-breeding areas, and we have never found a Lyme-infected tick in New York,\\" says Steven Matthews, spokesman for the department. Also, in the bug vein, there is now a trend toward natural bug-repellent products. Aveda, for instance, offers a body spray and patio candle called Attracts People Not Insects. For a homemade bug-bite treatment: Try compresses of equal parts skim milk and ice water, suggests Dr. Patricia Wexler, a New York dermatologist. \\nDIVERSION: See and Spray\\n\\n One toy already is beginning to look like a candidate for the summer's most-wanted list. Shout 'N' Shoot is a battery-operated, voce-activated water gun that is worn on the head and shoots water when the wearer speaks into an attached microphone. Some local toy stores say they are already sold out. Distributed by CAP Toys, of Bedford Heights, Ohio, Shoot 'N' Shout sells for an average retail price of $19.99. The company says it has sold close to a million just a few months.

Frequent precipitation made it difficult to obtain effective control with chemicals.

The spreading agent serves to break up the surface tension of the water, allowing the spray to spread uniformly over the plant surface rather than breaking up into drops. The sticker causes the spray chemicals to adhere to the plant as they dry, rendering them less likely to wash off should it rain, and thereby prolonging their effectiveness.
