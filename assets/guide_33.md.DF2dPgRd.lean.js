After George Bush succeeded Mr. Reagan, Mr. Morris aimed his guns at the harder-to-skewer 41st President. And in his new show at the Ballroom (253 West 28th Street, Chelsea, through July 25), he has widened his targets to include Gov. Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.    What distinguishes Mr. Morris's impersonations from those of previous Presidential parodists is the seriousness with which he approaches his task. In the age of sound bites and handlers, Mr. Morris's parodies are much more than personal demolition jobs. They are surreal exposes of the emptiness and equivocation of contemporary political rhetoric that makes candidates of every ideological stripe appear ridiculous and untrustworthy.

Last week's news that the Consumer Price Index had risen 0.2 percent in August, down from 0.4 percent in July, looked to some economists like validation that inflation was slowing, a trend that would not tempt the Fed to raise rates. But the Producer Price Index for August also comes out this week, helping to inform any decision (Tuesday). Other reports this week will include the second-quarter current-account deficit (Monday), August housing starts (Tuesday) and leading economic indicators (Thursday).    STORM CLOUD WARNING -- Directors of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will meet in Singapore to discuss, among other things, economic imbalances brought about by the United States' trade deficit with China (through Wednesday). The managing director of the I.M.F., Rodrigo de Rato, said in a speech this month that there were ''more clouds on the horizon than there were a year ago.'' In its semiannual World Economic Outlook last week, the I.M.F. said that the cooling housing market in the United States would probably slow domestic economic growth and suggested that further interest rate increases might be a good idea.    STRONG WORDS FOR CHINA -- Days after delivering a tough warning to China about its economic policies, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the United States Treasury secretary, visits Beijing this week, his first trip there since taking office this summer. Last week Mr. Paulson spoke out against China's policy of keeping its currency, the yuan, at an artificially low value in relation to the dollar, a policy that has led to record trade surpluses for China. He said that China's currency exchange rate was increasingly being viewed by its critics ''as a symbol of unfair competition.''

To insure that there will be four original episodes remaining for May -- the last of the three crucial \\"sweeps\\" months (after November and February), when ratings are used to set advertising fees -- the networks are forced to play a gambler's game.

Geoffrey Beene did that yesterday morning. He reverted to the custom of his early years as a designer by putting on a small-scale fall show in his showroom  on West 39th Street. Nothing was lost in the process, perhaps because his fans have had years to study his intricate cuts and creative uses of fabric. Or perhaps because it was one of the simplest collections he has ever done. Except  for a few -- very few -- touches of gleaming silver, the clothes were quiet and  sober. That didn't mean boring.

The key, it seems, is to think of the programs not as thematic, in the normal sense, but as parodies of thematic programs. That would explain Mr. Zukerman's program, which on the surface accommodated the week's Beethoven and Mozart theme but which actually emphasized distinctions rather than connections.    The opening work, in fact, tore through any presumed bond between the composers. Even on its own terms, Beethoven's brooding, introspective String Quartet in F minor (Op. 95) inhabits a world alien to Mozart at his darkest, and is certainly worlds removed from the program's sole Mozart offering, the Piano Concerto No. 21 in C (K. 467). But on Tuesday, the Beethoven was presented in Mahler's arrangement for string orchestra, a version that tears away the work's last links to Classicism and emphasizes its tendencies toward Romantic high drama.

So, when the house in which the composer first saw the light of day in December 1770 reopened in March after a year's closure for renovation, it revived one more attraction in a city that has never escaped John Le Carre's epithet: a small town in Germany.         Last year, fund-raisers for the $1.9 million restoration of the Beethoven house produced a slew of concerts culminating in the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter playing a selection of works by Claude Debussy, Wolfgang Rihm, Cesar Franck and, of course, Beethoven.

The stepson, \\"little Allen,\\" so called to distinguish him from his biological father, must have taken Frank Hajdys's stories to heart because in 1988, at the age of 18, he signed up and shipped out. \\"I thought I was the most proudest mother in the nation,\\" Dorothy has said.   \\"I THOUGHT I WAS THE MOST PROUDEST MOTHER IN the nation,\\" Dorothy was shouting into a microphone set up in front of the Capitol last April. A sad curiosity to the general public, which might have caught her on the evening news, Dorothy Hajdys (pronounced HAY-jiss) was a hero to the hundreds of thousands of people gathered before her at the gay-rights march on Washington. Earlier in the day they had cheered her wildly, this 47-year-old grandmother with the door-hinge voice and battleship proportions, marching at the head of a contingent of veterans and clutching a photograph of her son like a shield.

Mr. Skarmeta, a novelist who lives in exile in West Germany, obviously sympathizes with Mr. Neruda's politics, but he does not write with a heavy left hand. The poet's brief run as the Communist candidate for president of Chile takes up a few minutes, but otherwise, even at the play's end - when we are reminded of the assassination of President Salvador Allende and the imposition of the military dictatorship - politics is largely unspoken. Silence may be prudent in this case","excerpt":"before he died Mr. Neruda was bitterly attacked by Chilean student radicals who accused him of lapsing from the left.

As founder, playwright and star, Mr. Ludlam seemed irreplaceable. Since then, while respecting the theatrical legacy of his mentor and longtime companion, Mr. Quinton has given the company his own irreverent signature: Ludlamania has been Quintonized.   He has reconceived Ludlam comedies like \\"Bluebeard\\" and \\"Camille\\" in his own image, offered his own adaptations of classics (including his quasi-modish variation on \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\") and also presented plays by other Ridiculous hands (Georg Osterman's \\"Brother Truckers\\"). The season begins tomorrow night with \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\\" a first for the Ridiculous and, of course, a first for Shakespeare. In so doing, Mr. Quinton is fulfilling one of Mr. Ludlam's own dreams.

Five Americans were killed and some 30 wounded in the incident. It was the most devastating terrorist attack on Americans in the Middle East since the Beirut Marine bombing 12 years ago. If such an attack  were to happen in Bosnia, it could jeopardize the whole U.S. operation. So why is it shrugged off in Saudi Arabia?         In part, it's because no one knows who did it -- although a number of shadowy Islamic groups have claimed responsibility and Saudi officials have put out a police sketch of one of the suspected car-bomb drivers. In part, though, the silence is because U.S. officials fear drawing attention to anything unusual going on in Saudi Arabia. U.S. interests there are so vital that officials don't want to say anything that might rattle the ruling family or the U.S.-Saudi relationship. The U.S. has even withdrawn diplomats from Riyadh whom the Saudis  felt became too knowledgeable and frank about problems in the kingdom.

(Scribner, $14.) Set in the cloistered world of Bangladeshi immigrants in London's East End, this acclaimed first novel tells of an 18-year-old woman ''from the village'' who enters into an arranged marriage with a 40-year-old man who yearns to return home as a success. When his prospects sour, she becomes a garment worker and discovers her own desire: she falls in love with the man who delivers the clothes she works on. In her ''deeply rewarding'' tale, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2003, Ali displays a ''technical assurance and an inborn generosity that cannot be learned,'' Michael Gorra wrote in these pages.    The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn, by Diane Ravitch. (Vintage, $13.) In her study of bias and sensitivity panels set up to advise on textbooks and curriculums, the author argues that what began as an ''entirely reasonable'' effort in the 1960's to bring fairness to educational materials has evolved into a ''broad and increasingly bizarre policy of censorship.'' Last year our reviewer, Daniel J. Kevles, called this a ''revealing and important'' book.    Vernon God Little, by DBC Pierre. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) Talk about audacious territory for tragicomedy: Vernon Gregory Little, at the tender age of 15, becomes the center of his town's lust for retribution after his best friend comes to school with a rifle and murders 16 classmates. Though innocent, he stumbles though his ordeal, harassed, victimized, abused and eventually jailed. ''Pierre renders adolescence brilliantly'' in this ''dangerous, smart, ridiculous and very funny first novel,'' Sam Sifton wrote here in 2003.    Byron: Life and Legend, by Fiona MacCarthy. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $18.) Do we really need another biography of the 19th-century pop icon who spawned so many cultural clichés? This one breaks new ground by theorizing that Lord Byron was essentially gay and used women to distract him from his true desires at a time when homosexuality was a crime. Whether or not her premise holds up, MacCarthy's ''detailed chronicle of Byron's complicated romantic history'' brings us ''a little closer to the awe in which he was held by his contemporaries,'' Judith Shulevitz said here last year.    Parting the Desert: The Creation of the Suez Canal, by Zachary Karabell. (Vintage, $15.) In 1869, a French dreamer named Ferdinand de Lesseps succeeded in building one of the most heralded and contentious artifacts in history, replacing a wide sand track with a waterway that allowed the Red Sea to mingle with the Mediterranean for the first time. In his ''entirely splendid'' book, ''Karabell writes with the authority and power of a gifted and fascinated Arabist,'' Simon Winchester wrote here in 2003.    Evidence of Things Unseen, by Marianne Wiggins. (Simon & Schuster, $13.) This novel, which runs from World War I to the development of the atomic bomb, follows the lives of two American spirits: a practical small-town woman and her soulmate, a scientist and celestial idealist with a passion for all forms of natural light. The result is ''one of the most suggestively original love stories in our current fiction,'' Richard Eder said in these pages last year. ''Wiggins has written something approaching an epic.''    Scout's Honor: A Father's Unlikely Foray Into the Woods, by Peter Applebome. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) At the age of 49, Applebome, who writes the Our Towns column for The Times, joined a Boy Scout troop in Chappaqua, N.Y., with his son","excerpt":"before long he found himself hiking, camping and impaling his canoe on a rock. In his account of the scouting life, ''he accomplishes everything except tying knots and conveys his experiences with a delightfully self-deprecating humor,'' Diane Scharper wrote here in 2003.    Heart, You Bully, You Punk, by Leah Hager Cohen. (Penguin, $13.) In this novel about the mysterious, unpredictable ways people's hearts interfere with their lives, a Brooklyn math teacher volunteers to tutor an injured teenage student and winds up falling for her middle-aged father. As it exposes the three characters' very different attitudes toward love, the book becomes ''a lively, thoughtful pleasure,'' Benjamin Swett said here last year.

(MacAdam/Cage, $23.) A first novel that turns on Indian captivity (as other novels have done, notably works by Fenimore Cooper and Thomas Berger, so well the subject fits ''modern'' themes of isolation and identity loss). Its heroine, Abigail Buwell, is ''redeemed'' from a life she infinitely prefers to 19th-century Western civ.    OUR KIND, by Kate Walbert. (Scribner, $23.) A novel in stories, collectively narrated by women who came of age before 1960, the last educated generation to miss out on feminism, to know that the natural order made career and family incompatible, to choose, almost exclusively, motherhood. Now they are about to die off in a novel that zealously grapples with the passage of time.    RATS: Observations on the History and Habitat of the City's Most Unwanted Inhabitants, by Robert Sullivan. (Bloomsbury, $23.95.) An urban Thoreau spends his nights in a Manhattan streetlet, gathering the lore of Rattus norvegicus and studying its ways, which if not showy are very successful.    REMEMBER ME, by Trezza Azzopardi. (Grove, $23.) A suitably memorable British novel whose focus is Lillian, a vagrant old woman upstairs in an empty room. Nearly all she ever had has been taken from her, starting before World War II, and as her story is slowly unearthed from the bogs of East Anglia, loss itself becomes the subject of meditation.    CITY BOY, by Jean Thompson. (Simon & Schuster, $24.)

LINKS, by Nuruddin Farah. (Riverhead, $24.95.) Farah, a Somali novelist living in South Africa, explores his homeland's disintegration by sending his protagonist, Jeebleh, back to Somaliland, where he tries to find his mother's grave and rescue a kidnapped girl; menace succeeds menace so densely Jeebleh is soon possessed by a spirit of violent vengeance.    THE ISLAND AT THE CENTER OF THE WORLD: The Epic Story of Dutch Manhattan and the Forgotten Colony That Shaped America, by Russell Shorto. (Doubleday, $27.50.) A history of the first multiethnic, upwardly mobile society in America, tolerant (for 17th-century Dutch political reasons) of religious dissenters, embryo capitalists and hard drinkers; from it arose the fantastic metropolis that drove Boston into the second rank.    QUEEN OF SCOTS: The True Life of Mary Stuart, by John Guy. (Houghton Mifflin, $28.) A biography, by a Cambridge historian, of a woman whose privileged existence (queen of Scots in infancy, wife of the French dauphin at 15, notably good-looking) went all agley through a series of unwise decisions and later marriages until her head was cut off to fortify the title of Elizabeth I of England.

A novel in stories, collectively narrated by women who came of age before 1960, the last educated generation to miss out on feminism, to know that the natural order made career and family incompatible, to choose, almost exclusively, motherhood. Now they are about to die off in a novel that zealously and successfully grapples with the passage of time.    THE MADONNA OF EXCELSIOR, by Zakes Mda. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) The author, a South African playwright as well as novelist, conducts his story, which concerns forbidden sexual relations and their consequences, in a voice that is humorous, wry and generous, never softening the brutality visited on blacks but never denying the humanity of the oppressors as well as of the oppressed.    FREEDOM JUST AROUND THE CORNER: A New American History, 1585-1828, by Walter A. McDougall. (HarperCollins, $29.95.) In the first of a three-volume work, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian discerns a special American talent for making it, supplied by living where constraints on conduct were few.    RATS: Observations on the History and Habitat of the City's Most Unwanted Inhabitants, by Robert Sullivan. (Bloomsbury, $23.95.)

THE ISLAND AT THE CENTER OF THE WORLD: The Epic Story of Dutch Manhattan and the Forgotten Colony That Shaped America, by Russell Shorto. (Doubleday, $27.50.)

LIFE ON THE OUTSIDE: The Prison Odyssey of Elaine Bartlett, by Jennifer Gonnerman. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) The hard life and times of a young mother of four who drew 20 to life for her first offense -- selling cocaine to an undercover police officer -- against New York's drug laws. She saw her children, who were 10, 6, 3 and 1, in prison visiting rooms for the next 16 years until she was pardoned.    THE ACCIDENTAL CONNOISSEUR: An Irreverent Journey Through the Wine World, by Lawrence Osborne. (North Point/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.)
