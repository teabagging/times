Without Colette, no Metro kiosk would be complete, no sidewalk stall devoted to the flimsier and frankly less permanent merchandise of the Muses could hope to attract a following. And of all the characters who owe their existence to this popular author, none has achieved more commercial prestige than \\"Claudine,\\" whose unacademic board-school adventures are now under cinematic discussion at the Little Carnegie. As one of her local press agents has well observed, Claudine is the Scarlett O'Hara of France.In addition to her popularity, Claudine has one thing more in common with Scarlett: she is a period piece (circa 1908) and so is the ostensibly strait-laced school for misses in which she, the enchanting, hoydenish daughter of decayed provincial gentry, is the most brilliant and most troublesome pupil. But there is nothing period about the morals of certain of the school's faculty, as the author and M. Serge de Poligny, the director, take extremely unsubtle pains to emphasize. In that respect, the institution is by no means what you would call a Normal School. As the little errand-boy, Mouloud, exclaims (we follow the official translation in the superimposed English title): \\"Say, your school is a funny place!\\" This rather conspicuous peculiarity appears to center about the cold, hatchet-faced person of the directress, who first befriends Claudine herself with uncalled-for fervor, then suddenly switches her ambiguous interest to a new teacher from Paris.The story is primarily concerned with Claudine's innocent, yet likewise not-so-innocent, bewilderment among the vaguely indelicate interplay of feminine jealousies (for Claudine, too, acquires a crush on the Paris teacher), complicated by the arrival of a lone eligible male, a new doctor, into the community. To quote a friendly programmatic foreword by Colette herself: \\"Claudine, you are standing at the Threshold of Life—of Love. Your steps now are the most important in your life, for sometimes there are devious, perilous and forbidden bypaths for the unknowing traveler. In your eagerness, you must 'Watch Your Step!'\\"To connoisseurs of the French cinema, standing with perhaps equally dubious feet at the threshold of \\"Claudine,\\" we also should be inclined to advise caution. Aside from the moral issue, which is always controversial in these semi-esthetic matters, and the issue of good taste, which is a delicate thing to define, we must label \\"Claudine\\" a film of doubtful value, on its own cinematic face. Crudely literal where it should have been elusive, and vice versa, it does not repay the earnest efforts of Blanchette Brunoy and others in its cast to retrieve it from the curse of bald allusion alternating with low comedy. In fact, it is more than doubtful whether this Claudine is really a credit to her popular parent, Colette of the French Academy.

The instructions are attributed to a Mrs. Millet-Robinet's '' 'Maison Rustique des Dames,' a book that was extremely popular in the mid-19th century and that, judging from the manner of its arrangement and content, may well have had some influence on Mrs. Beeton,'' the British cooking authority. Here is the recipe:   ''The first essential is to leave the snails to starve for at least one month, enclosed in some kind of vessel, left in a cool but not damp place. There are cases of accidents having occurred when this precaution has not been taken: the snails, having fed on noxious plants, have caused food poisoning. At the end of this time, the snails are thrown into a caldron filled with boiling water (to which some add wood ash) and they are cooked for 20 minutes.

However, VICTORIAN FAIRY PAINTING (Merrell Holberton/University of Washington, $40), a collection of essays on fairies in Victorian music, literature, ballet, theater and book illustration, is as powerful an inducement to fancy as the opium that inspired a number of the paintings. Victorians were haunted by the fairies of Shakespeare's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' and of European folklore (rediscovered by the Romantics) largely because fairyland offered a warped mirror in which their era's concerns could be reflected. Rural superstitions about an uninhibited tiny people, over whom flowers towered and gravity's laws held no sway, provided a charming antidote to unsettling advances in scientific understanding and industrialization. For artists and writers, the imagination's powers were vindicated by the notion of a kingdom that only the inner eye could see (though misguided attempts were made to verify fairyland through the new eye of photography). Nearly every British painter of the period attempted descriptions of this fantastic landscape and its inhabitants. Some, like J. M. W. Turner, were merely dabbling (a fairy band appears almost as an afterthought near the bottom of his ''Queen Mab's Cave''). Others, like Richard Dadd, a schizophrenic institutionalized after killing his father, found a subject matter well suited to psychedelic extremes of proportion and detail. Dadd's dark, closely observed masterpieces realize the potential of a genre that was for some artists merely an excuse to drape nymphs in gossamer. The best of these paintings belie the insipidity of later, more familiar renderings of fairyland. Like the Victorian era itself, they are far more complicated and ambiguous than is commonly remembered.

Here in the Dominican Republic, nap capital of the Caribbean, people take their siesta seriously. Or rather, their lunch-and-siesta. The sleepy, steamy, three-hour calm between coffee-hopping Dominican mornings and rum-infested Dominican nights is excellent proof of the symbiotic relationship between food and human biological rhythms. Take away the plates heaped with glistening white rice, the bowls of burgundy-red habichuelas rojas, the golden Creole soups chunky with white yams and cassava, and hammock-swinging Santo Domingo afternoons would suddenly begin to bustle with appointments, marketing strategy sessions, three-way phone calls. To put it more simply, in this part of the world, beans become dreams.   And what dreams! There is an exquisite, almost hallucinogenic state that starts to take over toward the end of these Caribbean lunches -- an earthy nirvana of languor and garlic, inner peace and crispy fried plantains. Dominicans, I found out, have a word for this digestive ecstasy:    pavito    -- the little turkey (because you're stuffed). The causes and origins of pavito are a subject of much debate. One skeptical lunch companion of mine dismisses it as borderline drunkenness, the result of too much cerveza with the meal. Others take a more scientific approach. \\"When you eat so much good food, all the blood rushes to your stomach,\\" explains my friend Pedro. \\"It has to come from somewhere, so it runs down from your brain.\\" Hence the visions, the disorientation, the slow slip from reality into spicy, garlicky fantasies.

Review/Film; Mixture of Kitsch and Camp"},{"year":"1974","title":"When you play with clichés, you have to be very careful that they don't backfire","excerpt":"the little things have a way of maiming almost everything around them.Daniel Schmid's \\"La Paloma\\" — which was shown last night and to be repeated tonight at the New York Film Festival — is intentionally crammed with cultural chestnuts, and also makes a heavy pass at the plots of \\"Camille\\" and \\"La Traviata.\\" Kitsch and camp collide in this storm of pity and terror and wonder, which seethes with boundless love, burning glances, and unfathomable revenge. Nestling within this Swiss movie are some humorous intentions gone astray; it's also what they call dreamlike, although the dreams I've been watching lately have been funnier.A glum nightclub singer—Ingrid Caven, who's tricked out like a caricature of Dietrich — is ailing with some nameless rot. She permits a wealthy young admirer (Peter Kern) to cosset her, cure her, and finally marry her. It's repeated that she doesn't love him, but she cherishes his passion for her. Then she falls for his best friend and wants to decamp with him; her husband selfishly refuses to finance the expedition. Therefore, she dies slowly and even more tidily than Ali McGraw in \\"Lovy Story.\\"Her deathbed wish forces her husband to exhume and dismember her three years later; the corpse chuckles as he moans while converting it into cutlets. By then, since I was into the swing of the movie, I expected poisonous fumes to rise from the coffin and wipe out the suffering spouse—and was rather embarrassed when they didn't.Some obligatory decadence trickles through the nightclub scenes—but mercifully, the movie is set in 1952, so there aren't any Nazis around. The soundtrack endows the actors with theme-tunes; occasionally, they even flower into song, and the incidental music ranges from an opera by Erich Korngold to \\"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree.\\" Just after the couple are married, there's a soaring duet on a mountaintop. Suddenly, a transparent apparition floats over their heads: the thing grins jovially while its draperies flap in a breeze that doesn't even ruffle their coiffures.You can't really discuss \\"La Paloma\\" in terms of acting; the performers stalk rigidly about, exchanging long, brooding stares or significant smirks, and the result is a failed parody of the grand manner. (It was probably meant to be some sort of pantomime.) They also speak their lines very, very slowly — as though one another's reflexes were impaired.The ultimate astonishment is the appearance of Bulle Ogier as the husband's mother. Looking younger than her offspring, she doesn't seem to be on good terms with her cane. If only Elaine May had directed \\"La Paloma\\" — the brisk deadpan delivery that she can draw out of actors might have been marvelous for this material.

And \\"Nixon,\\" with Hopkins as the President who just couldn't stop disgracing and rehabilitating himself, is already the year's most talked-about movie, three days before it opens.         But while \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Nixon\\" face off against each other --  and against \\"Heat,\\" with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, \\"Jumanji,\\" with Robin Williams, and other high-powered movies -- smaller pictures are sneaking into town. (Many are finally turning up in theaters after being presented at the New  York Film Festival earlier this year.) These are risky films, sometimes unglamorous, sometimes sad, sometimes not even in the English language. They might have had to battle for attention at any time but are even more likely to be overshadowed in December, when the heavy-hitting Hollywood movies are hauled  out to qualify for awards.

Film scores are usually meant to be heard but not listened to, but this one is somewhere in between, seeming almost post-modern, commenting slyly on the action, even coaxing the audience to recall the words to once-familiar melodies. It was rediscovered in 1992, when the conductor and historian Gillian Anderson found it in the Chaplin archives in Vevey, Switzerland, along with the original scores to \\"The Gold Rush\\" and \\"A Woman of Paris.\\" It was heard for the first time in New York on Friday night at the Metropolitan Museum of Art with Ms. Anderson leading 10 members of the Manhattan School of Music Chamber Sinfonia, accompanying a sterling print of the 90-minute silent film.

This was the sense I had listening to performances of Northern Indian music at Symphony Space on Saturday night, presented by the World Music Institute. Although this concert, titled \\"Masters of Indian Music,\\" was supposed to last four hours, when I left after four and a half, the play was still proceeding.   At that time, Sultan Khan was coaxing extraordinary sounds out of his sarangi, one of India's oldest bowed instruments, carved out of a solid block of teak, with goatskin stretched over its resonating chamber. Mr. Khan, a member of one of India's musical families, has a worldwide reputation (he was heard on the soundtrack of \\"Gandhi\\"), but there was no sense of commercialism in his playing. Using fingernails to change pitches of the instrument's gut and metal strings (not the pads of the fingers as in Western string instruments), sliding into and out of notes, he made the ancient instrument (held like a cello by a cross-legged player) sound like a supple human voice. Its slightly nasal whine, produced with a thick bow, was shaped into wiry, sinuous phrases. Mr. Khan created miniature arabesques, toying with the ear in exquisite, ornamented melodies of a Karnatic, South Indian raga.

And if that weren't enough, the city often seems to add to all the frustrations with its own intractable conditions: dangerous subways, random violence, filthy streets, roving bands of nut cases, rip-off artists and con men. What Thomas Glynn has done in his first novel, ''The Building,'' is take all the grotesqueries of life in New York and reflect them through a fun-house mirror that distorts and magnifies all that is ugly and perverse. The result is a particularly nasty novel that strives to be taken as a hallucinatory epic about modern civilization - a novel that reads like a tabloid newspaper written by an assiduous student of Swift, Kafka and Marquez.

With Mr. Bush the acknowledged favorite for his party's nomination, some of his political adversaries have begun trying to shape the expectations by which they hope reporters and politicians will measure the Bush campaign. They are asking:   Will Mr. Bush distance himself from President Reagan to establish his own political identity? Is the Bush front-runner campaign going to parallel Walter F. Mondale's Democratic Presidential drive of 1984, which almost collapsed after his first primary loss? Are conservatives lin-ing up with Mr. Bush because they think he is an ideological convert or because they see his political organization as a vehicle for electing Republicans in 1986?   The Vice President told an audience in Detroit on Monday that ''it's a crying shame'' the 1988 Presidential campaign is starting so early in Michigan, a state that will begin its delegate-selecting process next August.

Nothing could be further removed from such rollicking competition as \\"Top Banana\\" and \\"New Faces\\" than this English-language version of Jean Cocteau's play, \\"Les Parents Terribles.\\"According to Carroll Pictures, the distributors, it ran in Paris for no less than five years. Whether out of deference to such whopping longevity or to a proven artist, there is small evidence of tampering, as the camera gingerly trails five lost souls around two interior sets for a rhetorical, frenzied Freudian charade. Directed by Charles Frank and produced by David Dent, it bears the bold thumbprint of a man who has done better.Once again, M. Cocteau's favored glass bell clamps down precisely on a family circle in torment, sparked by the diabolically ironic discovery that both son and father share the same mistress. Unfortunately, M. Cocteau's literate daring runs away with him, and a group of provocative people, aside from the focal psychopath, go careening toward a clanging, hysterical dénouement. Worse still, M. Cocteau knows better.The unsuspecting youth, for instance, played by Russell Enoch, is a sensitive but spunky specimen, proudly intent on installing his first conquest as a new bride. The others are not without their own persuasive points, as they endeavor, collectively and at cross-purposes, to spare him the awful truth. These include the stricken girl, quietly interpreted by Elsy Albiin","excerpt":"the lonely, gentle old philanderer, whom Harold Warrender plays with smooth understanding, and his smitten sister-in-law. In this role, Ruth Dunning trots about briskly as M. Cocteau's pithy, kibitzing mouthpiece. Then, from first to last, there is Mama, and at the top of her lungs.M. Cocteau remains naggingly magnetized by this nagging caricature of womanhood, not to say humanity, at the expense of the entire enterprise. Given full leeway and, whenever feasible, interminable close-ups, Marian Spencer yowls, pops her eyes and chews the scenery right down to the bedclothes after each hypochondriacal swan dive. The maternal thunder barely subsides for the film's highlight, one superbly conceived and well-performed scene with the father and girl at loggerheads over the boy.As we contend, the author does know better. He has perceptively hammerlocked youth and age, and until the half-way mark, the above-mentioned encounter, the quandary is genuinely intriguing. But M. Cocteau's triumphant rattling of the Oedipus legend tilts the apple cart, and some of his own dialogue provides the best summary.\\"What a nightmare!\\" moans Miss Spencer at one point.

Both groups offer a mix of old and new music, and the quintet will even give a master class in brass chamber music, featuring local student ensembles, at 2 P.M.    Film Festival Finale      The Hamptons International Film Festival ends today with a full slate of entries, including world premieres of the documentaries ''The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg'' at 10 A.M., ''Red, White and Yellow,'' at 11 A.M., and ''There's No Fish Food in Heaven,'' with Tea Leoni, at 10:30 A.M., and the United States premiere of ''Little Voice,'' with Jane Horrocks and Michael Caine, at 3:30 P.M. The closing-night screening features Isabelle Huppert in ''School of Flesh,'' 5:30 or 5:45 P.M. All these screenings take place at the UA Theaters in East Hampton. Student films will be shown at 10 A.M. and 12:30 P.M., with awards at 3 P.M., at Guild Hall in East Hampton. The world premiere of ''Three Businessmen,'' by Alex Cox, is at 4 P.M. at the Sag Harbor Movie. In Westhampton Beach at the Performing Arts Center, ''With Friends Like These,'' with Adam Arkin, at 2 P.M., and Jonathan Demme's ''Storefront Hitchcock'' at 5 P.M. complete the lineup  (324-4600).    Tea and History      If having tea with historical figures, reincarnated and transplanted to onetime Long Island estates, is, well, your cup of tea, then this should be a great time. In Centerport, chatting about their lives and times that on the surface could not be more dissimilar, reasonable facsimiles of Rosamond Vanderbilt, the lady of the mansion, and Mae West, the earthy actress, take ''Afternoon Tea'' at noon weekends and Tuesdays and Wednesdays through Oct. 28 at the Vanderbilt Museum on Little Neck Road (854-5511). In St. James, at Deepwells Farm on Moriches Road, ''Mrs. Gaynor Welcomes Harry Houdini,'' with the original owner of the mansion entertaining the legendary magician, who will entertain her in turn. The performances are Thursdays through Saturdays at noon and Sundays at 4 P.M. through Oct. 31 (862-6080).    'Cara's Cara-Van'      After Cara Manzella of East Moriches, a veteran actress, singer and dancer, won the Miss Senior America 1996 title, she decided to organize a troupe of performers who, like herself, were ''older,'' she said. ''But not necessarily professionals like me,'' added Ms. Manzella, whose film credits include ''Moonstruck'' and who knew Frank Sinatra during her nightclub-performing days. ''I wanted to get them out of the house and give them a purpose in life, give back some of what I had been given.''    Ms. Manzella, who says she is in her 60's, auditioned scores of would-be amateur performers and chose 25 Long Island singers, dancers, comedians and musicians from 60 to 89 who, under her concerted tutelage, now make up Cara's Cara-Van, a traveling variety show. The Cara-Van makes two stops this week: today at 3 P.M. at the Hampton Bays Library on Ponquogue Avenue (728-6241) and Saturday at 2 P.M. at the Museums at Stony Brook on Route 25A (751-0066).    'Poets and Artists'      When writers and artists get together on projects, which comes first, the poem or the painting?  There are no steadfast rules, says Barbara Johnston, the director of the Post Library Association, who, with Cynthia Jay, organized ''Poets and Artists: Collaborations and Connections,'' opening Thursday at the Hutchins Gallery on the C. W. Post campus in Brookville.    The exhibition of words and images hung side by side includes original artworks inspired by poems or created for published volumes or, in some cases, poems that came after the art. For example, the collages that John Digby did for ''Arches,'' a coming volume by the Welsh poet Tony Curtis, accompany the poems, and Don Resnick's watercolor that served as the cover art for the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Louis Simpson's volume ''There You Are,'' is shown, along with an essay the poet wrote about the artist's paintings on display. The exhibition, which runs through Dec. 5, opens with a reception on Thursday at 1:30 P.M., and at 2 P.M., Mr. Curtis is read from his works (299-2892).

As early as the 12th century, the memoirs of an Arab-Syrian warrior recount a women's race in Tiberias during the era of the Frankish crusaders.   ''I found myself in Tabarayyah at the time the Franks were celebrating one of their feasts,'' Usamah Ibn- Munqidh wrote in a work published by Columbia University in 1929. ''The cavaliers went out to exercise with lances. With them went out two decrepit, aged women whom they stationed at one end of the race course. At the other end of the field, they left a pig which they had scalded and laid on a rock. They then made the two aged women run a race while each one of them was accompanied by a detachment of horsemen urging her on. At every step they took, the women would fall down and rise again, while the spectators would laugh. Finally, one of them got ahead of the other and won that pig for a prize.'' Women's races were also held in Europe between the 13th and 15th centuries. In Vienna, the races became known as ''scarlet races'' because the most expensive prize in the event was a piece of scarlet cloth. Most of the participants, according to Austrian researchers, were prostitutes who ran half-naked, bedecked with flowers.

An aid worker in Nairobi had demonstrated the flush toilet to them -- also the seat belt, the shoelace, the fork. And now they found themselves alone in Minneapolis, three bone-thin African boys confronted by a swirling river of white faces and rolling suitcases, blinking television screens and telephones that rang, inexplicably, from the inside of people's pockets. Here they were, uncertain of even the rug beneath their feet, looking for this place called Gate C31.    Finally, a traveling businessman recognized their uncertainty. ''Where are you flying to?'' he asked kindly, and they told him. The eldest brother, his eyes deeply bloodshot, explained the situation in halting, bookish English. A few days ago, they had left a small mud hut in a blistering hot Kenyan refugee camp, where after walking for hundreds of miles across Sudan they had lived as orphans for the past nine years. They were now headed, with what Peter called ''great wishes,'' to a new home in the U.S.A. ''Where?'' the man asked when Peter Dut said the city's name. ''Fargo? North Dakota?

The styles that command the most attention are not the ones that rate high in shock appeal but those that make a smooth transition to fresh, new looks. It is, at any rate, the fabrics of fashion that offer the most news. They are mostly thin and fluid, with no hard edges. Many are crushed, crumpled and slashed.   Fluidity is a key to the Emporio Armani collection. This is something of a tour de force considering that Giorgio Armani's forte is tailoring. The jackets skim over the body as if they are tunics, and they are paired with trousers with legs wide enough to continue the feeling of ease. Sometimes there's a lace band at the wrists of a jacket where a cuff might be. Sometimes there's a line of embroidery down the outside of the trouser legs, where a satin ribbon could be placed if they were dinner pants.

Chevalier could not have meant this modest film to be anything but a genial trifle in a grimly disordered world, nor could he have meant his contribution to be anything more than a lark. In playing a happy-go-lucky vagrant who accepts an immense inheritance only to secure equal fortunes for three contingent inheritors and then tosses up the whole business when he finds it brings the others naught but ill, he probably assumed that he was showing a cheerful disregard for mere wealth and a wholesomely inspiring disposition to count life's blessings in other ways.But somehow the shocking appearance of the old bon vivant in shabby rags, more happily disposed toward gutters and wheelbarrows than comfortable beds","excerpt":"the look of him, wearily dragging his heavy frame hither and yon or drearily croaking a bleak song called \\"The Hobo's Serenade,\\" offers a melancholy prospect—to this reviewer, at least. There is not, in this dismal apparition, very much of the old Chevalier.Neither is there, in this picture, very much in the way of humor, whimsey, invention or support for the one-time dazzling star. The script by Marc-Gilbert Sauvajon, who also directed, is a hackneyed, lifeless thing, and the rest of the cast is so routine that none of its members are worthy of mention by name.For a man who has made so many happy and has yet a mellowed talent to expend, there must be something more vigorous, more optimistic than this.

A new work by Ariel Dorfman (''Death and the Maiden'') about a couple living in a war-torn country waiting for their 15-year-old son to return home. Rosemary Harris and John Cullum star (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212.    Broadway    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'IN MY LIFE'  Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prize winner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone, who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, but not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BACH AT LEIPZIG' Itamar Moses's comedy is an ardent but hollow literary homage to Tom Stoppard stuffed with arcana about religious and musical squabbles in 18th-century Germany and knowingly feeble jokes. Despite the nimble gifts of a first-rate cast, the play never works up the farcical energy to lift us over the puddles of book-learning (2:15). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'BROKEN JOURNEY' A gripping production of a modern-day rendering of ''Rashomon'' by a British poet and playwright who employs clever wordplay to define the characters and delve into their psyche. A solid cast manages to hold the tension taut for most of the 110 minutes. Theater Three, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FIVE COURSE LOVE'  This musical is pleasantly fluffy, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way, but lots of laughs (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100.(Genzlinger)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE GENTLEMAN DANCING-MASTER'  The Pearl Theater Company is having way more fun than a company specializing in classics ought to have with this 17th-century comedy by William Wycherley. Marsha Stephanie Blake is terrific as a young woman betrothed to her cousin but hot for someone else","excerpt":"the loons who surround her are great, too (2:50). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)    'HAMLET' Michael Cumpsty gives a forceful, intelligent reading of the title role in the Classic Stage Company's likably intimate production of Shakespeare's tale of doom-struck Danes. Brian Kulick's production is heavy on the directorial gimmickry (smell the spray paint! watch the set be shredded!), leaving psychology and philosophy to fend for themselves (2:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'HILDA' Marie Ndiaye's play is a psychodrama from which most of the psychology seems to have mysteriously evaporated, taking a lot of the drama with it. Ellen Karas stars as a bourgeois housewife whose obsession with her maid eventually unhinges her (1:20). Part of the Act French Festival. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'MISS WITHERSPOON' This poignant, funny mess of a comedy by Christopher Durang, set in an antechamber of the afterlife, cheerfully suggests that there are worse fates than death for sensitive souls in this self-destructive world. The play meanders but has the good fortune to star the priceless Kristine Nielsen as a dead woman who intends to stay that way (1:20). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4-year-old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but all others will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'ON SECOND AVENUE' This genial show by the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, celebrating Second Avenue's theatrical heyday, somehow manages to be both a perfect ensemble production and a star vehicle for Mike Burstyn. The production, first seen last March and April, is in its second go-round (2:00). J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' It remains prime entertainment (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas, Manhattan, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    'RFK'  This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)    'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easygoing to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'DOÑA ROSITA LA SOLTERA (DOÑA ROSITA THE SPINSTER)' Watching Repertorio Español's ''Doña Rosita the Spinster'' is a bit like finding a dried flower pressed in a book: charming, archaic and just a bit musty, even though the lead is played by Denise Quiñones -- Miss Universe, 2001. Federico García Lorca's poetic play has a predictable premise: a beautiful young woman waits in vain for the handsome cousin to whom she is engaged. Luckily, the tragicomedy has some laughs (2:00). In Spanish with live simultaneous translation via headsets. Repertorio Español, at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Phoebe Hoban)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100.

(Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' An uninspired revival of Alan Ayckbourn's classic farce of marital misery and Christmas cheerlessness, directed by John Tillinger. The largely merely serviceable cast includes Paxton Whitehead, Mireille Enos and the wonderful Deborah Rush, who sidesteps the usual clichés of playing drunk in splendid comic style (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Brantley).    'JUNIE B. JONES'  A spirited entertainment (1:30). Theaterworks/NYC, at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Van Gelder)    'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY'  Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'THE RUBY SUNRISE' Rinne Groff's period drama explores the country's growing pains during the early years of television. Directed by the new Public Theater chief, Oskar Eustis, the play casts glancing looks at a large subject, namely the country's failure to harness advances in technology to socially progressive ends. But it is essentially a deftly structured but heavy-treading drama about the dashed dreams and tarnished ideals of two generations of spirited Midwestern women (2:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'SEE WHAT I WANNA SEE' A hot-and-cold chamber musical by Michael John LaChiusa, based on stories by Ryuonsuke Akutagawa, that considers the nature of truth and belief. The show's film-noir-style first half is more chilly than chilling. But its second act, set in the shadow of 9/11, throbs affectingly with a hunger for faith. With Idina Menzel and Marc Kudisch (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'BEE SEASON' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A genuinely felt, finely made adaptation of the Myla Goldberg novel about an 11-year-old girl with an ineffable gift for summoning up perfectly strung-together words. With Richard Gere, Juliette Binoche, Max Minghella and the wonderful newcomer Flora Cross as the family nearly undone by that gift. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden)     * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)      'DERAILED' (R, 110 minutes) A glossy and often risible bit of trash about an adulterous affair gone bad, bad, bad, starring the invaluable Clive Owen and an uncomfortable-looking Jennifer Aniston. (Dargis)    * 'DOWN TO THE BONE' (No rating, 105 minutes) ''Down to the Bone,'' which won the Special Jury Prize at last year's Sundance Festival, is the kind of movie most independent films strive in vain to be: a small, beautifully faceted gem. Vera Farmiga gives a pitch-perfect performance as Irene, a mother of two whose life is precariously built around a cocaine addiction. (Dana Stevens)    * 'THE DYING GAUL' (R, 105 minutes) Craig Lucas's screen adaptation of his bitter Off Broadway revenge tragedy, is a sublimely acted film and a high point in the careers of its three stars, Campbell Scott, Patricia Clarkson and Peter Sarsgaard, who play a bisexual Hollywood studio executive, his wife and a young screenwriter. (Holden)    'GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' ' (R, 134 minutes) This lumbering vehicle for the rap star 50 Cent blends gangster intrigue with follow-your-dream striving. The story is a mess, and the star is no actor, but a fine supporting cast and Jim Sheridan's warm-hearted direction make it watchable. (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)    'IN THE MIX' (PG-13, 97 minutes) This predictable, one-dimensional romantic comedy is all about its star, Usher, who plays a New York D.J. beloved by one and all. Beautiful women lust after him, but when a Mafia princess (Emmanuelle Chriqui) joins their number, her mobster father (Chazz Palminteri) disapproves. Even though Darrell (Usher) once took a bullet for him. (Anita Gates)     'JARHEAD' (R, 123 minutes) Sam Mendes's film about marines waiting for action in the 1991 Persian Gulf war is often vivid and profane, like the Anthony Swofford memoir on which it is based, and some of the performances crackle with energy. But the film as a whole feels strangely detached and -- even more strangely, given its topical resonance -- irrelevant. (Scott)    'JUST FRIENDS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) In this crude, clobbering comedy, a former geek who has reinvented himself as a Hollywood smoothie (Ryan Reynolds) returns to his New Jersey hometown to win his high school dream girl (Amy Smart). (Holden)     'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)      * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'PRIME' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Actually, pretty mediocre. A thin romantic comedy that nonetheless has its charms, most of them provided by Uma Thurman as a divorced 37-year-old who falls for a 23-year-old who happens to be her therapist's son. (Scott)     'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)    'SEAMLESS' (No rating, 75 minutes) Four upstart fashion designers toil with fabrics and finances as they compete for a career-making award in this genial documentary from Douglas Keeve, the maker of ''Unzipped.'' (Nathan Lee)    * 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)     * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    '39 POUNDS OF LOVE'  (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Hebrew) Afflicted by a rare disease that keeps his weight at 39 pounds and allows him to move only one finger, the 34-year-old animator Ami Ankilewitz still dreams of riding a Harley-Davidson. In this lighthearted yet forthright documentary, the director Dani Menkin presents a bracingly honest portrait of a man refusing to be defined by the limitations of his body. (Jeannette Catsoulis)       'USHPIZIN' (PG-13, 91 minutes, in Hebrew) In this groundbreaking collaboration between secular and Orthodox Israelis, two roustabouts barge into the home of a Hasid and his wife and make comic trouble. (Holden)    'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)     'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)     'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden)    Film Series    BRIGHT STARS, BIG CITY: CHINESE CINEMA'S FIRST GOLDEN ERA, 1922-1937 (Through Dec. 22). The Museum of Modern Art begins its celebration of Chinese film and Shanghai's movie stars tonight.

(Gates)    FOREVER GARBO: A RETROSPECTIVE (Through Dec. 17) The American-Scandinavian Foundation's program honoring Greta Garbo's centennial continues tomorrow with ''Mata Hari'' (1931), in which Garbo plays the World War I spy, and on Wednesday with ''Anna Karenina'' (1935), in which she stars as Tolstoy's doomed adulterer opposite Fredric March as Vronsky. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates)     HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: THE MOVING IMAGE OF MODERN ART (Through Dec. 11) Japan Society continues its series of films selected by Mr. Sugimoto, the visual artist, for their emphasis on artifice and their influence on Japanese modernism.

This weekend's features include ''Gimme Shelter'' (1970), about the Rolling Stones and Hell's Angels at the tragic Altamont concert; ''Showman'' (1963), about the Hollywood producer Joseph E.

The program begins Monday with ''Rio 40 Graus'' (1955), a political comic drama about poor street children in Rio de Janeiro. Tuesday's feature is ''Rio Zona Norte'' (1957), a sequel of sorts, about a dying samba musician. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * AGAINST ME (Tonight) These folk-punkers from Gainesville, Fla., up the ante by including left-wing politics in their energized mix. 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $15. (Laura Sinagra)    BETTY (Thursday) With increased notoriety thanks to Showtime's ''L Word,'' the anything-goes activist cabaret pop band Betty plays holiday fare, joined by J. D. Samson of Le Tigre and Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; $20. (Sinagra)    BLOOD ON THE WALL (Tonight) This shaggy Brooklyn trio fronted by the guitarist and vocalist Brad Shanks and his sister, the bassist and vocalist Courtney Shanks, make hip-shaking rock with a touch of Midwestern-gothic twang. Psychic Ills opens. 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $8. (Sinagra)    DEAD MEADOW, WITCH (Thursday) Dead Meadow plays hard rock that evokes rolling expanse the way that the blues-metal this group loves once evoked misty Gothic castles. Witch is the folk-metal project of the Dinosaur Jr. guitarist J Mascis. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    KARL DENSON'S TINY UNIVERSE (Tonight) Karl Denson, who played saxophone in Lenny Kravitz's band, is eager to push jazz back onto the dance floor. He has his heart in 1950's hard-bop and 1970's funk: music that takes liberties but never lets go of the beat. 8, B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25. (Jon Pareles)    DEPECHE MODE, THE BRAVERY (Wednesday and Thursday) In the 1980's and 90's, Depeche Mode's danceable synthesizer darkness, fetish melodies and mall-ready maladjustment made the group the industrial electro-pop band to beat. After some solo-project detours, the band is back, in this goth-friendly time, to its reliable formula. A less downcast version of neo-new-wave, the Bravery is tougher than its contemporaries like the Killers, if not always as much fun. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $40 to $85. (Sinagra)    DINOSAUR JR. (Tonight and tomorrow night) Dinosaur Jr., the seminal band that melded the apathetic cool of American punk with the guitar blare of classic rock, reunites its contentious original lineup. Love As Laughter opens. 8, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, East Village, (212) 777-6800; $30. (Sinagra)    DONOVAN (Wednesday) The singer-songwriter responsible for both ''Season of the Witch'' and the best scene in the Bob Dylan documentary ''Don't Look Back'' continues his hurdy-gurdy grooviness. 8 p.m., Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, www.concertstonight.com, (212) 307-7171; $40 and $45. (Sinagra)    GOLDFRAPP (Monday) Allison Goldfrapp and his partner, Will Gregory, make electronic music that harkens back to the glam side of disco. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $28 (sold out). (Sinagra)    JULIANNA HATFIELD (Wednesday) Ms. Hatfield's voice, that of a weary but urgent ingénue, added sharp charm to the music of the Blake Babies in the 1980's and her solo projects in the 90's. This singer-songwriter continues to release albums with a low-key, confessional spark. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; $14. (Sinagra)    * IRON & WINE AND CALEXICO (Sunday, Monday and Tuesday) The modern rustic Sam Beam takes a whispery, almost Chet Baker-like approach to folk vocals. Sung atop delicately plucked guitar, his lyrics speak to the sensitive male's concerns about intimacy and mortality. Calexico plays desert rock bathed in pedal-steel mystery and orchestral ambience. Their collaboration hauls the quiescent Mr. Beam out on a colorful road trip. This show is billed as a mix and match affair, with guests, patterned on Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $25. (Sinagra)    * BETTYE LAVETTE (Sunday) Bettye LaVette of Detroit released her first recording when she was 16, and soldiered on through a career that carried her through 15 labels, minor rhythm-and-blues hits like ''He Made a Woman Out of Me'' and years in Europe. But her tough, knowing voice and sense of drama could rival Tina Turner's, and she recently released a hand-tooled set of songs by women -- ''I've Got My Own Hell to Raise'' (Anti) -- that's the soul album of the year. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $20. (Pareles)    TED LEO & THE PHARMICISTS (Tomorrow) The Irish-American indie rocker Ted Leo plays soulful punk, nearly popping a neck vein for political justice. But his melodic sensibility and falsetto also recall the 70's arena rock of bands like Thin Lizzy. Also on the bill are the Exit and the Black Hollies. 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 E 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $17. (Sinagra)    YASMIN LEVY (Tomorrow) This Israeli singer draws on the Sephardic musical traditions of 15th-century Andalusia, Morocco and Turkey.

(Sinagra)    MENDOZA LINE (Tonight) The local band Mendoza Line writes lilting songs with cutting lyrics about betrayal, jealousy and disappointment. Its best choruses turn on phrases like ''We're all in this alone.'' The band plays here with Meredith Bragg & The Terminals, who favor distractedly emotive pop reminiscent of the Shins. 10:30, Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10. (Sinagra)    * NELLIE McKAY (Monday and Tuesday) A couple of years ago, this young cabaret-pop wiseacre had critics grinning at her perky piano bar confessionals and cutesy Eminem-style rap screeds. She's a commanding talent, if often overbearing, and she's got new songs that should keep her marketing people confused. Monday at 7 p.m., Makor, Steinhardt Building, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 601-1000; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. Tuesday at 6 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $18 in advance, $20 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)    BOB MOULD (Tomorrow) The barky baritone who provided the punk dissonance in Husker Dü and went on to alt pop success with the muscularly melodic Sugar has spent the last decade experimenting with more intimate forms of expression. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    MYSTIC VOICE OF CROATIA (Tonight) Croatia's Dalmatian coast is home to the polyphonic vocal tradition known as klapa, an all-male style influenced by Italian harmonics.

(Sinagra)    LEONA NAESS (Thursday) This English-born singer-songwriter has a voice that can slide from sharp to smoky during songs parsing both love's loll and its sting. She has cast about for a reliable style, opting most recently for an elemental approach. 9 p.m., The Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; $10. (Sinagra)    BRAD PAISLEY (Wednesday) Taking another lap through town after the recent Country Music Awards, this regular-guy superstar singer-guitarist brings his well-modulated lovin', drinkin' and fishin' songs back to the big city. Sara Evans opens. 7:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171;$39.50 (sold out). (Sinagra)    PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES, THE DOUBLE (Monday and Tuesday) The Seattle group Pretty Girls Make Graves recalls that mid-90's moment when punk holler met modern rock sheen, and lots of bands with girl singers got airtime. The Double uses all the tools at its lo-fi disposal in service of arty pop undercut with burbles, dark surges and twinges. Tangiers opens. Monday at 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $12. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $13. (Sinagra)    ROGUE WAVE (Tonight) Yet another meditative band to be rolled in with the Shins, Rogue Wave plays that kind of wishing-well rock that, when done right, washes over you while adding gravitas to your flakiest concerns. Mazarin and Shelby open. 8:30, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15.

(Sinagra)    TOSCA (Wednesday) Richard Dorfmeister, of the late 90's electronic music duo Kruder & Dorfmeister, here teams up with the pianist and composer Rupert Huber for a still-mellow, but funk-informed pastiche , sometimes involving vocalists. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza,17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sinagra)    YOUNG JEEZY AND T. I. (Tonight) Two of the hottest current exponents of Atlanta's hip-hop sound unite for the Georgia Power Tour. ''Snowman'' Young Jeezy raps ''I'm a product of my environment/ so I move products of my environment'' with a pushy swagger that distinguishes his brand of Southern style from Houston's slow-mo. He joins here with T. I., whose ''Bring Em Out,'' turned a chorus-line piano vamp into a beatdown threat. 8, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000; $19.75 to $37.50.

(Dunning)    * 'THE NUTCRACKER' (Tonight through Thursday) The New York City Ballet in George Balanchine's perennial holiday favorite (through Dec. 30).

(Dunning)    * SASHA WALTZ (Through Dec. 10) The most noted of the German choreographers of the generation after Pina Bausch, Ms. Waltz returns to the Brooklyn Academy of Music from her home base in Berlin with ''Impromptus,'' set to Schubert and replete with what the Next Wave Festival brochure calls ''strong formal elements.'' Tuesday, and Thursday through Dec. 10 at 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100 or www.bam.org; $20 to $55. (Rockwell)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    ASIA SOCIETY: 'VIETNAM: DESTINATION FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM -- THE ART OF DINH Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the Space Age. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'EDWARD BURTYNSKY: MANUFACTURED LANDSCAPES,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early Northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show will figure on any shortlist of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the 1939 New York World's Fair. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Grace Glueck)     * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * MET: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT,' through Dec. 31. Hands down, the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, séance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. (See above.)(Michael Kimmelman)     * MET: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well-known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. (See above.) (Kimmelman)      * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: BEYOND THE VISIBLE: 'THE ART OF ODILON REDON,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-siècle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)      * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART : 'ELIZABETH MURRAY,'  through Jan. 9. Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    * THE MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'LASTING FOUNDATIONS: THE ART OF ARCHITECTURE IN AFRICA,' through Jan. 9. Like most architectural shows, this one uses lots of photographs and texts, and more than many, it also incorporates objects: Dogon door locks from Mali; carved Igbo doors from Nigeria; Swahili window frames, rich with Indian and Islamic motifs, from Kenya. An evocative film of the annual replastering of the great Mosque of Djenne, the largest adobe building in the world, is an inspired bonus: a vision of an architectural monument as love object. World Financial Center Courtyard Gallery, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (718) 784-7700. (Cotter)    * NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY: 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS,' through Feb. 12. Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069. (Smith)        * P.S. 1: 'THE PAINTED WORLD,' through Jan. 30. Though this 23-artist exhibition of mostly contemporary abstractionists lacks bite as a whole, every individual painter in it is worthy of attention. In addition to ancestral figures like Myron Stout and Moira Dryer, the show includes Philip Taaffe, Mary Heilmann and Chris Martin. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084. (Johnson)     * RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART : 'WHAT IS HIMALAYAN ART?,' This museum, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, is a oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Cotter)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and mid-size New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)      * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. (Kimmelman)    Galleries: 57th Street    GLENN KAINO An installation by this West Coast conceptualist features a big chessboard made of wooden squares taken from gun ammunition boxes and bronze playing pieces made from casts of the artist's hand signaling friendly and unfriendly intentions. On the walls hang grisaille portraits of famous chess players, each painted in one hour. Projectile, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 688-1585, through Dec. 22. (Johnson)    TOM WESSELMANN: 'WORKS ON PAPER, RETROSPECTIVE'  Typed as a Pop artist early on for his portrayals of commercial foodstuffs as well as of stylized women's bodies (or parts thereof) that mingled classic odalisque and sexy pinup, Tom Wesselmann (1931-2004) had other strings to his bow, among them an interest in landscape and, later in his career, large abstract cutouts in metal. His provocative nude icons are here in abundance, but also evident is his interest in Matisse, Picasso and Mondrian. Maxwell Davidson Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 759-7555, through Dec. 23. (Glueck)    * 'THE WOMEN OF GIACOMETTI' This museum-quality show of paintings and sculptures focuses on Alberto Giacometti's curiously asexual representations of his mother, sister, wife and other women in his life. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, through Dec. 17. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea     POLLY APFELBAUM: 'CARTOON GARDEN' Give Ms. Apfelbaum credit for trying one of her signature fabric floors without color. Still, though the wide rectangular plot of cartoon blossoms drawn with black dye on pieces of white velvet is graphically lively, the aesthetic payoff as a whole is not worth the sacrifice of color. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through Dec. 23.(Johnson)    * JEREMY COMINS While neither especially original nor current, Mr. Comins's small carved wood sculptures evoke the history of the medium with assured sophistication, impeccable craft and that unmarketable commodity called integrity. Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through Dec. 10. (Smith)    * 'DANUDO: RECENT SCULPTURES OF EL ANATSUI' In this truly stunning two-gallery show of recent work by an artist who lives and works in Nigera, each sculpture is made from thousands of crushed aluminum liquor-bottle caps and seals, stitched together with copper wire. The results are supple, fabriclike hangings that look like a cross between Kente cloth, abstract paintings and magic carpets. At Skoto Gallery in Chelsea, the work glows like gold on plain white walls; at Contemporary African Art on the Upper West Side, which is open only on Saturdays from noon to 6 p.m., it generates its heat with a more intimate kind of magic in an apartmentlike space. Skoto Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, fifth floor, (212) 352-8058, through Jan. 21, and Contemporary African Art Gallery, 330 West 108th Street, (212) 749-8848, through April 30. (Cotter)    MONA HATOUM: 'MOBILE HOME' The playful side of this often politically motivated sculptor prevails. The centerpiece, ''Mobile Home,'' is an arrangement of domestic objects strung on fine cables between metal traffic barriers; it takes a moment to realize that the toys, chairs, suitcases and other items are slowly rolling back and forth on tiny wheels. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 367-7474, through Dec. 22. (Johnson)  Julie Langsam: 'From Here to Modernity' and Gary Petersen: 'Colossal Youth' In Ms. Langsam's landscape paintings -- which mourn the demise of Modernism -- Breuer's Whitney Museum and Wright's Guggenheim and other monuments of 20th-century architecture are isolated far away on empty plains under gloomy, toxically colored skies. On the other hand, while Mr. Petersen's jauntily suave, geometric paintings are hardly revolutionary, they still exude an infectious optimism about the aesthetic and spiritual delights that Modernism still makes possible. Michael Steinberg, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 924-5770, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)    * 'MFENGU' The power of female creativity courses through this exquisite show of South African garments at Axis Gallery. All but one of the skirts and capes was made for, and by, women of the Mfengu cultural group. In every case, the surfaces are ornamented with lines of beadwork, as fine and taut as compass needles. Agnes Martin would have adored the elegant probity of this work, and its message of strength in restraint. Axis Gallery, 453 West 17th Street, fourth floor, (212) 741-2582, through Dec. 22. (Cotter)    Other Galleries    ELSA MORA: 'BIRTH' A Cuban-born New Yorker, Ms. Mora creates paintings, drawings, collages and sculptures of lyrical and seemingly antique surrealism. One series consists of 50 small bottles, each containing a photographic transparency and sporting a colorful sculptured bird head and a pair of baby-doll legs. Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 925-1200, through December. (Johnson)    RICHARD TUTTLE: 'CONSTRUCTED RELIEF PAINTINGS' Among the most appealing works in Mr. Tuttle's current retrospective at the Whitney are the eccentrically shaped, single-color paintings from the 1960's. This show presents more of those playfully Minimalist pieces, which, with their wavering outlines and thick sides, look as if they were cut from slabs of colored rubber. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, through Jan. 28.(Johnson)    Last Chance    * JEREMY BLAKE: 'SODIUM FOX' The best animated video of this innovative artist's career is a dense, briskly based fusion of formalism and underbelly, both indubitably American, propelled by the words and voice of the poet David Berman. Feigen Contemporary, 535 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-0500, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    * OPEN WALLS In the main gallery, six emerging artists each make impressive and quite different use of one wall for displays of painting, photography, video or installation; the exemplary ancillary shows and debuts include ''The Early Show,'' a survey of childhood and teenage efforts by 40 contemporary artists. The total confirms White Columns as the liveliest of Manhattan's revitalized veteran alternative spaces. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street (entrance on Horatio Street) ,West Village (212) 924-4212, closing tomorrow. (Smith).     * NANCY SPERO: 'CRI DU COEUR' Mixing paint and silkscreened images on paper, a low-lying friezelike work follows a procession of female mourners borrowed from an Egyptian tomb into inky obscurity, suggesting a world declining into violence, chaos and bottomless grief. Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 315-0470, closing tomorrow. (Smith).    * JOHN WESLEY: 'DON'T EAT MY EAGLE' A beautiful show of comical and erotic paintings from the 1960's by an American Surrealist who has been mistaken for a Pop artist. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6555, closing tomorrow.

The star of ''Chicago'' and ''West Side Story'' relives many of her (and Broadway's) greatest moments, with the help of a book by Terrence McNally (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'HAYMARKET' Opens Monday. Using research from newspaper accounts and trial transcripts, Zayd Dohrn's play tells the story of the leaders of Chicago's Haymarket Square riots of 1886 (2:05). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.    'THE OTHER SIDE' Opens Tuesday. A new work by Ariel Dorfman (''Death and the Maiden'') about a couple living in a war-torn country waiting for their 15-year-old son to return home. Rosemary Harris and John Cullum star (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212.    'A CHRISTMAS CAROL' Previews start Saturday. Opens Thursday. The family-friendly company Theaterworks/NYC brings back that beloved revival of Christmases past. (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200.    'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' Opens Thursday. The ''Peanuts'' gang finally grows up in this parody of Charles M. Schulz's comic strip. Eddie Kaye Thomas (''American Pie'') plays the hapless Charlie Brown (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200.    'ALMOST, MAINE' Previews start Thursday. Opens Jan. 12. A comedy featuring 11 episodes, which all take place at 9 p.m. on a Friday, about love and heartbreak in a cold town in Maine (2:00) . Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200.    'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' Previews start Thursday. Opens Jan. 10. The New York premiere of a new play by Nilo Cruz (''Anna in the Tropics'') about a young woman who travels to Spain to reconcile with her father (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212.    'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Jan.10. If you're pining away for the television series ''Entourage,'' currently on hiatus, you might want to try Douglas Carter Beane's new comedy, which covers similar territory: Hollywood agent, cute movie star, tabloid gossip (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' Previews start today. Opens Dec. 18. Dana Ivey stars in what might be the best play about hookers ever written, courtesy of George Bernard Shaw, who deftly exposes double standards in Victorian society (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737.    Broadway    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prizewinner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone, who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble case as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, but not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BACH AT LEIPZIG' Itamar Moses's comedy is an ardent but hollow literary homage to Tom Stoppard stuffed with arcana about religious and musical squabbles in 18th-century Germany and knowingly feeble jokes. Despite the nimble gifts of a first-rate cast, the play never works up the farcical energy to lift us over the puddles of book-learning (2:15). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM'  The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE GENTLEMAN DANCING-MASTER'  The Pearl Theater Company is having way more fun than a company specializing in classics ought to have with this 17th-century comedy by William Wycherley. Marsha Stephanie Blake is terrific as a young woman betrothed to her cousin but hot for someone else","excerpt":"the loons who surround her are great, too (2:50). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)    'MISS WITHERSPOON' This poignant, funny mess of a comedy by Christopher Durang, set in an antechamber of the afterlife, cheerfully suggests that there are worse fates than death for sensitive souls in this self-destructive world. The play meanders but has the good fortune to star the priceless Kristine Nielsen as a dead woman who intends to stay that way (1:20). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4-year-old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but all others will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'ON SECOND AVENUE' This genial show by the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, celebrating Second Avenue's theatrical heyday, somehow manages to be both a perfect ensemble production and a star vehicle for Mike Burstyn. The production, first seen last March and April, is in its second go-round (2:00). J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' It remains prime entertainment (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas, Manhattan, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easygoing to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL'  Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (2:15). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100.

(Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'BROKEN JOURNEY' A gripping production of a modern-day rendering of ''Rashomon'' by a British poet and playwright who employs clever wordplay to define the characters and delve into their psyche. A solid cast manages to hold the tension taut for most of the 110 minutes. Theater Three, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, closing tomorrow. (Wilborn Hampton)    'HAMLET' Michael Cumpsty gives a forceful, intelligent reading of the title role in the Classic Stage Company's likably intimate production of Shakespeare's tale of doom-struck Danes. Brian Kulick's production is heavy on the directorial gimmickry (Smell the spray paint! Watch the set be shredded!), leaving psychology and philosophy to fend for themselves (2:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'IN MY LIFE'  Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100, closing Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'AEON FLUX' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Adapted from MTV animated shorts from a decade ago, this glossy, incoherent movie sends Charlize Theron 400 years into the future, where she runs around and does somersaults in a spandex body suit. (A. O. Scott)    'BE HERE TO LOVE ME' (No rating, 99 minutes) Margaret Brown's documentary biography of the brilliant, deeply troubled Texan singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt is a tender, impressionistic labor of love. (Stephen Holden)    * 'BEE SEASON' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A genuinely felt, finely made adaptation of the Myla Goldberg novel about an 11-year-old girl with an ineffable gift for summoning up perfectly strung-together words. With Richard Gere, Juliette Binoche, Max Minghella and the wonderful newcomer Flora Cross as the family nearly undone by that gift. (Manohla Dargis)    'THE BOYS OF BARAKA' (No rating, 84 minutes) If you take the boy out of the inner city, you stand a good chance of taking the despair and hopelessness of the inner city out of the boy: that's the message sent by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's documentary about a group of boys from the slums of Baltimore who spend a year studying at a school in rural Kenya. (Holden)    * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Holden)    'DÍAS DE SANTIAGO' (No rating, 83 minutes, in Spanish) Pietro Sibille captivates as a frustrated Peruvian veteran in this promising debut by Josué Méndez. (Nathan Lee)    * 'DOWN TO THE BONE' (No rating, 105 minutes) ''Down to the Bone,'' which won the Special Jury Prize at last year's Sundance Festival, is the kind of movie most independent films strive in vain to be: a small, beautifully faceted gem. Vera Farmiga gives a pitch-perfect performance as Irene, a mother of two whose life is precariously built around a cocaine addiction. (Dana Stevens)    * 'THE DYING GAUL' (R, 105 minutes) Craig Lucas's screen adaptation of his bitter Off Broadway revenge tragedy, is a sublimely acted film and a high point in the careers of its three stars, Campbell Scott, Patricia Clarkson and Peter Sarsgaard, who play a bisexual Hollywood studio executive, his wife and a young screenwriter. (Holden)    'FAR SIDE OF THE MOON' (No rating, 105 minutes, in French) An alternating rewarding and frustrating drama about two brothers who find themselves in each other's gravitational pull after the death of their mother. From the noted Québécois stage director Robert Lepage. (Dargis)    'FIRST DESCENT' (PG-13, 110 minutes) This nostalgic, hyperbolic, intermittently spectacular look at the history of snowboarding makes for middling documentary but excellent sport porn. (Lee)    'GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' ' (R, 134 minutes) This lumbering vehicle for the rap star 50 Cent blends gangster intrigue with follow-your-dream striving. The story is a mess, and the star is no actor, but a fine supporting cast and Jim Sheridan's warm-hearted direction make it watchable. (Scott)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)    * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)    'IN THE MIX' (PG-13, 97 minutes) This predictable, one-dimensional romantic comedy is all about its star, Usher, who plays a New York D.J. beloved by one and all. Beautiful women lust after him, but when a Mafia princess (Emmanuelle Chriqui) joins their number, her mobster father (Chazz Palminteri) disapproves. Even though Darrell (Usher) once took a bullet for him. (Anita Gates)    'JARHEAD' (R, 123 minutes) Sam Mendes's film about marines waiting for action in the 1991 Persian Gulf war is often vivid and profane, like the Anthony Swofford memoir on which it is based, and some of the performances crackle with energy. But the film as a whole feels strangely detached and -- even more strangely, given its topical resonance -- irrelevant. (Scott)    'JUST FRIENDS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) In this crude, clobbering comedy, a former geek who has reinvented himself as a Hollywood smoothie (Ryan Reynolds) returns to his New Jersey hometown to win his high school dream girl (Amy Smart). (Holden)    'KISS KISS, BANG BANG' (R, 103 minutes) Clever and dumb at the same time, this hectic pastiche of Los Angeles noir conventions offers opportunities for Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan to have a good time with hard-boiled dialogue, and the audience to have a few laughs watching them. The picture's self-conscious manipulations of tone and chronology might have seemed fresh and witty 10 years ago, but probably not even then. (Scott)    'THE LEGEND OF ZORRO' (PG, 126 minutes) Like most sequels, this successor to ''The Mask of Zorro'' feels obliged to outperform its forerunner by being bigger, faster and more spectacular. That translates into busier, sloppier, less coherent and more frantic. (Holden)    'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)    * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)    'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott)    'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)    'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)    'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden)    Film Series    BRIGHT STARS, BIG CITY: CHINESE CINEMA'S FIRST GOLDEN ERA, 1922-1937 (Through Dec. 22). The Museum of Modern Art continues its celebration of early Chinese film and Shanghai's movie stars. This weekend's silent classics include ''Coming Home'' (1934), a psychological drama about a man with two wives; ''The Goddess'' (1934), starring Ruan Lingyu, sometimes called the Chinese Garbo, as a mother driven to murder; and ''The Pearl Necklace'' (1926), based on a Guy de Maupassant story about theft and embezzlement.

(Gates)    ESSENTIAL HITCHCOCK (Through Jan. 12) Film Forum's five-week retrospective of Hitchcock's films begins today with the 1954 classic ''Rear Window,'' in which a bored photojournalist (James Stewart) with a broken leg suspects a neighbor has committed murder. Monday's double feature is ''The Lodger,'' a 1926 silent about a serial killer who goes for blondes, and ''Blackmail'' (1929), the story of a shopkeeper's daughter who commits murder and her Scotland Yard boyfriend. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10.

The series will also include the original ''Trapped by the Mormons''; John Ford's ''Wagon Master'' (1950); and ''New York Doll'' (2005), a documentary about Arthur Kane, rock star turned Mormon convert. 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village, (212) 591-0434; $9.

Tuesday's feature is ''The Amulet of Ogum'' (1974), about a young man made invulnerable to bullets by the Candomblé gods. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    RECENT FILMS OF LAURA MORANTE (Through tomorrow). The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of four films starring the Italian actress Laura Morante concludes this weekend with four films, including Michele Placido's ''Journey Called Love'' (2002), in which Ms. Morante plays the Italian novelist Sibilla Aleramo, and ''The Dancer Upstairs'' (2002), a political thriller directed by John Malkovich. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)    HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: THE MOVING IMAGE OF MODERN ART (Through Sunday) Japan Society's series of films selected by Mr. Sugimoto, the visual artist, concludes on Sunday with Kon Ichikawa's ''Ten Dark Women'' (1961), about harried employees at a television station. The films have been chosen for their emphasis on artifice and their influence on Japanese modernism. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 752-3015; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

(Laura Sinagra)    FIONA APPLE (Tonight) As a teenage singer-songwriter, Ms. Apple made provocative therapy pop, combining a bad girl's desire with the sad damage of a violence victim. Her recent batch of moody, wordy, at times thrilling declarations of identity and lover's recriminations languished until rough mixes produced by Jon Brion surfaced and her label finally released an album of retooled versions. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $40.

(Sinagra)    THE COMAS, SAM CHAMPION (Wednesday) Like a lot of indie-rock bands, the Comas seem tentative about really trying. But when they do, as on the best cuts from last year's dreamy ''Conductor'' (Yep Roc), their portrayals of wage slavery and lolling slacker lust exude an intriguing passive-aggression. The ambling 90's slacker-rock nostalgists Sam Champion open. 9 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $10. (Sinagra)    CORMEGA, KILLAH PRIEST (Tomorrow) The raw, observant Cormega is part of the Queensbridge rap crew that spawned lots of other acts, but he's never gained more than cult and critical fame. Killah Priest is a Wu Tang Clan member who has divided his time between music and cultural edification.

(Sinagra)    THE DONNAS (Thursday) The brash charm of these rockers has always teetered between fabulous and prefabricated. But any feisty put-ons fall away when the guitarist Donna R.

(Sinagra)    DWELE (Sunday) This Detroit neo-soul singer harks back to the R & B of the 70's, but unlike those artists for whom that aesthetic means keeping a distance from hip-hop, he's also working in that arena, recording with rappers like his hometown's Slum Village. Abby Dobson opens. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)    EXPLOSIONS IN THE SKY (Sunday, Monday and Wednesday) This Midland, Tex., band makes melancholy instrumental music in the vein of Godspeed You Black Emperor, but perhaps a little more contemplative.

(Sinagra)    MITCHELL FROOM (Wednesday) This producer of career-shaping albums by the likes of Los Lobos and his ex-wife Suzanne Vega makes his own music, which jumps genres.

(Sinagra)    MARK MALLMAN (Monday) The Minneapolis keyboardist Mark Mallman would mythologize himself into relevance if he could: his day-and-a-half ''marathon'' shows in his hometown have set Guinness world records for ''longest song.'' But this high-voltage showman has some glam-pop chops too. 8:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $7.

(Sinagra)    DAVE MATTHEWS BAND (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Matthews, a superstar on the jam-band circuit, embodies the bliss and torment of a regular guy whose everyday joys are at times tainted by dark moods and unruly desires.

(Sinagra)    GWEN STEFANI, CIARA (Thursday) Ms. Stefani, the lead singer of the pop-ska band No Doubt, was always destined for savvier collaborators. Her girl-next-door-meets-plastic-fashionista vibe is enhanced with top producers' hip-hop beats. The R & B singer Ciara tries to fill the shoes of Aaliyah, a singer who could ride hip-hop beats with a conspiratorial, low-key urgency. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $75.00. (Sinagra)    LAURA VEIRS, JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Sunday) Seattle's versatile-voiced Seattle singer-songwriter Laura Veirs sets her smart, introspective pop musings apart from other singer-songwriter fare with atmospheric full-band instrumental work that weaves in violas and acoustic bass without sounding precious.

(Sinagra)    X, JULIANA HATFIELD (Tonight) The L.A. band X chiseled out its own niche -- trashy rockabilly marriage-punk. This is the original lineup: the vocalist Exene Cervenka, the vocalist and bassist John Doe, the guitarist Billy Zoom and the drummer D. J. Bonebrake. Ms. Hatfield's voice, that of a weary but urgent ingénue, added sharp charm to the music of the Blake Babies in the 80's and her own opinionated, confessional solo projects after that. 6:45 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $29.50 in advance, $34 at the door.

(Holden)    STEVE TYRELL (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Tyrell has one of those where-have-I-heard-it-before growls that sounds great on a movie soundtrack but loses its charm in a club, as he rolls standards off the assembly line as if they were all the same song. 8:45, with additional shows at 10:45 tonight, tomorrow and Thursday nights, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100 tonight and tomorrow; $90 Tuesday through Thursday.

Opera    'AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY' (Monday) Tobias Picker's much anticipated opera, based on Theodore Dreiser's landmark 1925 novel, a rare Metropolitan Opera commission, breaks no new ground for musical originality and dramatic inventiveness. This is an unabashedly conventional melodrama. Whole stretches of Mr. Picker's Neo-Romantic score would not be out of place on Broadway. Still, with an effective libretto by Gene Scheer that reduces the 900-page novel to its essential narrative strands, ''An American Tragedy'' has its own kind of sweep and passion. And every time Mr. Picker summons his modernist vein, the music becomes more challenging and consequently more involving. The production by Francesca Zambello, with its three-tiered set, is impressive to see and flows deftly. And the cast could not be better, with the dashing baritone Nathan Gunn as Clyde Griffiths, the ambitious social climber; the soprano Patricia Racette as the wistful factory worker Roberta; and the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham as the moneyed and dazzling Sondra. James Conlon conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini)    'LA BOHÈME' (Tonight and Thursday night) The Metropolitan Opera's production receives its last two performances of the season.

(Jeremy Eichler)    'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) ''Carmen'' will sell tickets no matter who is in it. Denyce Graves has now resumed one of her signature roles, while Ruth Ann Swenson appears as Micaëla, a role that seems something of a departure for her. Don José tomorrow is Marcello Giordani, who should excel in the role; on Wednesday, it's Marco Berti, who has a very loud voice and no particular grace. Erwin Schrott is Escamillo, and Philippe Jordan remains the crisp and able conductor. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; remaining tickets, $26 to $220. (Anne Midgette)    'RIGOLETTO' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Make way for the new love couple: this weekend is New York's chance to see whether Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón can live up to all their hype. Certainly they're talented young singers with that increasingly rare quality, box-office power. The title role is cast less prominently, with Carlo Guelfi; Eric Halfvarson is Sparafucile, and Asher Fisch conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out, but returned tickets may be available at the box office.

(Holland)    JUILLIARD CENTENARY (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) The celebrations move to Carnegie Hall this weekend, with performances by Juilliard faculty and students. Tonight in Zankel Hall, the pianists Joseph Kalichstein and Brian Zeger are joined by vocal and instrumental students in works by Brahms, Ravel, Rossini and Wolf. Tomorrow, again in Zankel, the Juilliard String Quartet performs Ezequiel Viñao's Quartet No. 2, commissioned by the school, and then joins forces with students for the Mendelssohn Octet. And on Sunday in Isaac Stern Auditorium, James Conlon leads some combined forces in Mahler's colossal Symphony No. 3. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $10 to $25. (Eichler)    JUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) In the spirit of its idiosyncratic founder, Jens Nygaard, this feisty ensemble offers programs that combine oddities and either familiar works or lesser-known scores by well-known composers. This week the fare includes Rachmaninoff's rich-hued ''Trio Élégiaque,'' as well as Josef Suk's ''Elegy'' and a Wind Quintet by Josef Bohuslav Foerster. 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 799-1259; $10 to $25.

(Holland)    BEJUN MEHTA (Tonight) Mr. Mehta is one of the sweetest and more mellifluous singers in the countertenor vocal category; he appears in concert at the Temple of Dendur in a wide-ranging program of German and English songs. 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $60. (Midgette)    NEW AMSTERDAM SINGERS (Tonight and Sunday) Clara Longstreth, the music director of the New Amsterdam Singers, has a gift for putting together rewarding programs of the old and the new. Even for this weekend's holiday program, Ms. Longstreth and her choristers are presenting an unusual program of ''gentle carols and syncopated songs,'' as the news release puts it, alongside the mellow music of Vaughan Williams and Randall Thompson. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Immanuel Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 88th Street, (212) 842-1511; $20; $15 for 65+; $10 for students. (Tommasini)    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) Taking a leaf from the Vienna Philharmonic's book, the orchestra splits itself in two so that it can be two places at once. While some of its musicians are on their home stage playing works by Haydn and Mozart under the baton of Christian Zacharias -- who will also be the piano soloist in Mozart's B-flat Concerto (K. 456) -- the rest will be uptown at Riverside Church performing Handel's ''Messiah'' with Richard Hickox conducting, and the Westminster Symphonic Choir providing choral heft for an attractive solo roster that includes Christine Brandes, soprano; Sara Mingardo, contralto; Mark Tucker, tenor; and John Relyea, bass-baritone. The Haydn and Mozart program is at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, $26 to $94; the ''Messiah'' performances are at 7:30 p.m. at Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 120th Street, Morningside Heights, $27 to $70; (212) 721-6500. (Kozinn)    CHRISTOPH PRÉGARDIEN (Sunday) The German tenor Christoph Prégardien has won acclaim for his elegantly lyrical and penetrating performances of the art song repertory. Here with the pianist Dennis Helmrich, he performs Schubert's ''Winterreise,'' and it should be interesting to hear how he adapts his refined singing style to this bleakly affecting and, by the end, shattering song cycle. 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $48. (Tommasini)    ST. THOMAS CHOIR (Tuesday and Thursday) Of all the ''Messiah'' performances that blossom around New York in the weeks before Christmas, this one -- sung by a choir of men and boys and accompanied by period instruments -- is the one that shouldn't be missed. John Scott, the new choral director at St. Thomas, leads the performance by the church's choir and Concert Royal. The soloists are Ellen Hargis, soprano; James Bowman, countertenor; Marc Molomot, tenor; and Thomas Meglioranza, bass. 7:30 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360; $30 to $80; $25 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)    TACTUS (Monday) This adventuresome student ensemble serves up an all-Elliott-Carter program, with works culled from the last five decades of his career, from the Cello Sonata (1948) to ''Of Challenges and of Love'' (1994). 8 p.m., Manhattan School of Music, 122nd Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (917) 493-4428; free. (Eichler)    TALLIS SCHOLARS (Tomorrow) This magnificent early-music choir honors its namesake, Thomas Tallis, in the second installment of a 500th-birthday tribute. Included on the program are some of Tallis's most sublime sacred works -- the Missa Puer Natus Est Nobis and the Lamentations I -- as well as works by John Taverner and William Byrd. 8 p.m., Church of St. Paul the Apostle, Columbus Avenue at 60th Street, (212) 854-7799; $35. (Kozinn)    TRINITY CHOIR (Sunday) In the cornucopia of holiday ''Messiahs,'' this is a reliable standout, as well as the one with the longest tradition: ''Messiah'' received its American premiere at Trinity Church in 1770. It also has a special claim to authenticity, not only because of the Rebel Baroque Orchestra but also because the conductor, Owen Burdick, follows Handel's own conducting cues. 3 p.m., Trinity Church, Broadway at Wall Street, (212) 279-4200; $25 to $45. (Midgette)    TRIO MEDIAEVAL (Tomorrow) Lest anyone be misled by the name of a group that specializes in music new and old, this excellent a cappella group, fresh from a fine performance in the recent Bang on a Can opus ''Shelter'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, is now offering a more conventional concert with, as usual, a focus on contemporary composers to balance out the 14th-century fare. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38. (Midgette)    WAVERLY CONSORT (Tomorrow and Sunday) ''A Christmas Story'' is one of this venerable group's oldest traditions, combining music from around Europe with narrative in the manner of a medieval church play. 1 and 3 p.m., the Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 650-2290; $45. (Midgette)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

(Dunning)    MONICA BILL BARNES (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) Ms. Barnes likes to burrow into pop culture in her sometimes comical dances.

(Dunning)    DANIEL CHARON (Thursday) The company will perform five duets described as tranquil, theatrical and evocative. Sounds good to us. 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479 or www.joyce.org; $15; $12 for students and 65+.

(Anderson)    JOHN JASPERSE (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday through Thursday) Be warned: for Mr. Jasperse's new ''Prone,'' the audience will watch not only from chairs but also while lying on the floor among the dancers. Given the delicacy and imagination of his choreography, it might be worth it. (Through Dec. 17.) Tonight and Thursday night at 7 and 9; Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m.; The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793 or www/thekitchen.org; $15.

(Dunning)    * SASHA WALTZ (Tonight and tomorrow) The most noted of the German choreographers of the generation after Pina Bausch, Ms. Waltz returns to the Brooklyn Academy of Music from her home base in Berlin with ''Impromptus,'' set to Schubert and replete with what the Next Wave Festival brochure calls ''strong formal elements.'' 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100 or www.bam.org; $20 to $55. (Rockwell)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    Asia society: 'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the Space Age. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early Northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show will figure on any shortlist of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the 1939 New York World's Fair. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Grace Glueck)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20, the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT,' through Dec. 31. Hands down, the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, séance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Michael Kimmelman)    * Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    * Museum of Modern Art: Beyond the Visible: 'The Art of Odilon Redon,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-siècle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)    * The Museum for African Art: 'Lasting Foundations: The Art oF Architecture in Africa,' through Jan. 6. Like most architectural shows, this one uses lots of photographs and texts, and more than many, it also incorporates objects: Dogon door locks from Mali; carved Igbo doors from Nigeria; Swahili window frames, rich with Indian and Islamic motifs, from Kenya. An evocative film of the annual replastering of the great Mosque of Djenne, the largest adobe building in the world, is an inspired bonus: a vision of an architectural monument as love object. World Financial Center Courtyard Gallery, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (718) 784-7700. (Cotter)    * P.S. 1: 'The Painted World,' through Jan. 30. Though this 23-artist exhibition of mostly contemporary abstractionists lacks bite as a whole, every individual painter in it is worthy of attention. In addition to ancestral figures like Myron Stout and Moira Dryer, the show includes Philip Taaffe, Mary Heilmann and Chris Martin. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084. (Johnson)    * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' This museum, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, is a oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Cotter)    The Noguchi Museum: 'The Imagery of Chess Revisited,' through March 5. In 1944, the artists Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp and the gallery director Julien Levy organized an attention-getting New York exhibition devoted to chess, once a chic pastime for members of the artistic intelligentsia. Organizers of this historically intriguing show managed to find most of the works that were in the original exhibition, including chess sets designed by the artists Isamu Noguchi, Alexander Calder and Man Ray and artworks in various media relating to chess by Dorothea Tanning, Alberto Giacometti and John Cage, whose chessboard incorporates musical notation for a piano composition that you can hear on headphones. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    * Claes Oldenburg This excellent show of works from the 60's by this seminal Pop artist includes paint-splattered objects like oversize sneakers and a slice of pie à la mode and soft, stuffed objects like a toilet and a giant house key. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, through Dec. 23.(Johnson)    * 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. Goya gets things officially started. The show takes in contemporaries or near-contemporaries like Eva Hesse, Basquiat and Matthew Ritchie. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman)    CY TWOMBLY: 'BACCHUS' Eight paintings deliver a red-hot visual tsunami via the artist's characteristic spiraling scribbles writ large across amazing, angry, joyful enveloping surfaces that are in the grand tradition of the aging painter letting it rip. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street, (212) 744-2313, through Dec. 24. (Smith).    Galleries: 57th Street    Glenn Kaino An installation by this West Coast Conceptualist features a big chessboard made of wooden squares taken from gun ammunition boxes and bronze playing pieces made from casts of the artist's hand signaling friendly and unfriendly intentions. On the walls hang grisaille portraits of famous chess players, each painted in one hour. Projectile, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 688-1585, through Dec. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    Carolina Raquel Antich: 'All of a Sudden' An Argentinian who lives in Venice, where she was included in last summer's Biennale, Ms. Antich makes extremely spare paintings and drawings of children that exude moods of such sweet innocence that you can't help suspecting something malevolent lurking just beyond the outer edges of her imagery. Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)    Dave Cooper: 'pictorial ruminations on the volume and density of mostly pillowy girls' Comically weird illustration is enjoying great popularity among artists under 40. The Ottawa-based Mr. Cooper is a master of the genre. His manically surrealistic paintings and drawings of toothy, pop-eyed women in hectic situations mix attraction and repulsion with infectious verve. Jonathan Levine, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 243-3822, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)    * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort-of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith).    * 'Mfengu' The power of female creativity courses through this exquisite show of South African garments at Axis Gallery. All but one of the skirts and capes were made for, and by, women of the Mfengu cultural group. In every case, the surfaces are ornamented with lines of beadwork, as fine and taut as compass needles. Agnes Martin would have adored the elegant probity of this work, and its message of strength in restraint. Axis Gallery, 453 West 17th Street, fourth floor, (212) 741-2582, through Dec. 22. (Cotter)    David Salle: 'The Vortex Paintings' Each of Mr. Salle's new, disappointingly bland paintings features the image of a woman distorted into an almost illegible spiral, with neatly painted objects like hats and seashells floating in front, and, in some cases, comic book panels copied from a pornographic version of Disney's ''Snow White'' in the background. Mary Boone, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929, through Dec. 17. (Johnson)    * Zarina Zarina Hashmi was a nomad long before a peripatetic way of life became art-world fashion. Now in her 60's, she was born in India, has spent long stretches of time in other parts of Asia, and in Europe and Latin America. Even after making New York City her base in the 1970's, she kept on the move, and the semiabstract, minimalist art in this beautiful show is about self-location, past and present, in the face of constant change.

(Cotter)    Galleries: SoHo    * JIM DRAIN and ARA PETERSON: 'HYPNOGOOGIA' With a kaleidoscopic, mirrored DVD installation and multifaceted sculptures that resemble gaudy 12-foot-high soccer balls, two of contemporary art's most interesting collaborators have masterminded a kind of wonderland of digital and analog psychedelia. The best piece is best experienced by descending into a kind of rabbit hole on a ladder. The total effect is amazing, if a little vacant.

On each, the chief image is a review of a previous exhibition at the gallery. Although not small, they are presented in a stack leaning against the wall that the viewer can browse through, as through a file of clippings, or arrange as desired. Reena Spaulings, 371 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006, through Dec. 18. (Smith)    Last Chance    ROBERT HENRI: 'THE PAINTED SPIRIT' This large survey of portraits by the early, early Modernist painter and teacher who alerted many of his fellow Americans to the gestural and tactile possibilities of paint (Stuart Davis, for example), spans much of his career, from commissioned portraits to nudes to his sympathetic renderings of Irish children, American Indians and Spaniards of many persuasions. A certain academicism sometimes intercedes, but his vigorous love of paint as paint, absorbed from Velásquez, Goya and Manet and conveyed to these shores just when it was needed, still astounds.

Bitter and angry about that, Israeli tourists, the hotel's only natural clientele, stopped coming.

There is a ban on canine pets, and the police are seen enforcing it with typical dutifulness. Taking notes at their headquarters on each new Government slogan or dictum, they function as petty bureaucrats more than serious crime-stoppers. Dogcatching is about the heaviest  responsibility they are asked to shoulder.         These bicycle-riding policemen look like gentle souls, and Miss Ying observes them with bemused curiosity. With an entirely nonprofessional cast and all police roles played by real Chinese policemen, her film has effortless authenticity and a quiet, watchful style. It empathizes with the police in finding their jobs hard and their role confusing. They live in a society that demands utmost obedience to the law, yet many of the laws are of little real consequence. The police put in long, grueling hours just meddling in people's lives.

Also reminiscent of the hand of one or another of his peers is M. Vadim's use of a roof-top chase with the exotic foreign city dazzling us from below and the machanical men beating clocks among the spires.Unfortunately, he has extended this same act of borrowing to the basic ingredients of his story, the banality of which no visual excitement can camouflage.

Vadim was apparently banking for comic relief, which, by the way, never comes.Furthermore, the plot is centered within the baron's palace fronting on a canal. This affords the writer-director added occasion for lush décor and for handsome illustrations of vivid-hued gondolas and spiffy-looking motorcraft plying and purring through the gilt-edged waterways. Once you peel away these pretty pictures, however, you will find a rather square and hollow drama.The most up-to-date effect of the film is a shuffling and bubbling sound-track by the Modern Jazz Quartet. As for the rest of M. Vadim's extravagantly produced melodrama, it has more oldish schmaltz than modern jazz.

The explanation can be summarized in two words: affordability and accessibility.\\n\\nThe average eastern-panhandle home costs about $75,500, while average prices in neighboring counties of Maryland and Virginia, the beneficiaries of the growth in the greater Baltimore and Washington regions, are about double that.\\n\\n\\"We can afford exactly what we want here,\\" said Joan Capell, who bought a vacation home with her husband, John, a few years ago at a resort community in Hedgesville, which is on the outskirts of Martinsburg in Berkeley County. They now plan to build a year-round house nearby.\\n\\nVacationers and retirees, as well as a growing number of workers willing to endure a 90-mile commute to the Washington area in exchange for lower housing costs in peaceful rural communities, are heading to the eastern panhandle. It embraces the three counties of the easternmost strip of land in West Virginia, somewhat like the handle of the bowl-shaped bulk that is the rest of the state. \\n\\nDespite the distance, commuting to Washington is relatively easy because of the trains that leave twice in the morning rush from Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry, just minutes from here. \\n\\nThose who drive can take Interstate 81, which goes through Martinsburg, or Interstate 270, through Frederick and Montgomery Counties in Maryland.\\n\\nThe population of the panhandle rose by about 22 percent in the 80's, the 1990 census shows. In Berkeley County, which had 46,775 people in 1980 and 59,253 in 1990, 4,152 residential building permits were issued from July 1, 1985, to last June 30. In neighboring Jefferson County, where the population rose from 30,302 in 1980 to 35,926 in 1990, 1,837 new residential units were built between July 1, 1985, and June 30, 1990.\\n\\nBy contrast, the state as a whole lost 7.6 percent of its population in the last decade, the third of the last four decades in which its population dwindled.\\n\\nThe natural beauty of the eastern panhanhandle, which is attracting new residents, has lured visitors for years. The panhandle is hilly and heavily wooded, and the rivers skirting its borders have long been popular with outdoor enthusiasts. \\n\\nVisitors also come for history, which can be found in places like Harpers Ferry. In 1859, the village overlooking the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers was the site of the ill-fated attempt by the abolitionist John Brown to seize the Federal arsenal and begin a slave insurrection.\\n\\nOther attractions in the area are the many factory outlets in Martinsburg, the commercial center of the panhandle. \\n\\nThe appeal to visitors led to resort development, which in turn has spurred the home-buying market. An example is The Woods resort and conference center in Hedgesville, where the Capells own a vacation home. The Woods began as a vacation resort 15 years ago. \\n\\nIn 1987, it began adding year-round residences. The Woods now has 870 housing units, a golf course, a conference center, tennis courts, exercise rooms and miles of hiking trails.\\n\\nFROM 1987 to 1990, 80 to 85 housing units a year sold at The Woods, said Andrew D. Michael, vice president of the resort. This year, the recession has slowed sales to an estimated 20 to 30 for the year, he said. Prices of one-family homes range from about $115,000 to $275,000, while a two-level, two-bedroom golf town house sells for $107,500, Mr. Michael said.\\n\\n\\"About two-thirds of our owners are from the Washington area,\\" Mr. Michael said. \\n\\nNearby Tomahawk Run is another development intended to attract buyers tired of the hassles of urban living.\\n\\nSet on 350 wooded acres, the development is covered by regulations aimed at retaining as much of the rustic appearance as possible. Houses built on the two- to-five-acre lots must be of natural materials. As few trees as possible should be cut, said Jan Rooney, who is developing the area along with her husband, Boyd, and her sister-in-law, Judy Erskine. The homes must also be at least 2,000 square feet, and utility lines have been laid underground.\\n\\nThe 22 lots in the first phase, on 78 acres, have been on the market since April, and two have sold. Prices range from $20,000 to $40,000. \\n\\nThe Capells, who moved to their vacation home in Hedgesville from Laurel, Md., after Mr. Capell retired from his job as an engineer, said they had originally intended to relocate within Maryland. But they settled on West Virginia, Mrs. Capell said, after finding that raw land in Maryland would cost only slightly less than the house and the lot they will have at Tomahawk Run. \\n\\nThe couple now have their home at The Woods on the market so that they can build a house at Tomahawk Run. Although their new home will cost about $200,000 -- well above the average price in the region -- Mrs. Capell said that it will have 2,400 square feet and include a home office with state-of-the-art equipment for her husband's consulting business.\\n\\nMrs. Capell said her daughter and son-in-law also relocated to the panhandle because they could not afford a home in the Washington area. Her son-in-law commutes by train daily to his job in Rockville, Md. \\n\\nThe eastern panhandle is also proving somewhat attractive to businesses based in Washington and Baltimore and to Government agencies interested in relocating back-office operations.\\n\\nTHE Internal Revenue Service has maintained some offices in Martinsburg for about 15 years and is now planning an expansion. The Central Intelligence Agency also plans to build new offices in Jefferson County. The Coast Guard will soon open its national computer center in Berkeley County, and the Veterans Administration will open its telecommunications network headquarters in Martinsburg.\\n\\nBruce Van Wyk, a panhandle developer who works to lure businesses to West Virginia, said some people question the continued development in the panhandle while Washington suffers an office glut.\\n\\n\\"We're not selling the office space,\\" he said. \\"We're selling the labor force. Businesses can save $10,000 per employee per year here.\\"\\n\\nA data-entry employee, for example, is paid about $5 an hour in West Virginia, but more than $8 an hour in Washington, he said. Lower salaries, lower benefit packages and a generally favorable business tax structure make the area attractive for businesses, he said.\\n\\nMr. Van Wyk is developing a $6.5 million office, commercial and residential park in Falling Waters, north of Martinsburg. Homes there and in other Van Wyk developments range from $85,000 to $122,000, he said. They are still selling well, he added. \\n\\nThe attractiveness of the homes to workers also serves as a catalyst for businesses to relocate, Mr. Van Wyk said.\\n\\n\\"When we talk to businesses, we find some already have a good portion of their work force who live in West Virginia,\\" he said.

Leuchter Jr., execution consultant to 16 states, is but the latest chapter in the misguided search for a \\"humane\\" manner of execution.   As you say, hanging has proved unreliable. Botched hanging efforts date at least as far back as the notorious case of John Smith, a British burglar condemned to death in 1702, who swung for 15 minutes until onlookers' chants of \\"A Reprieve\\" persuaded authorities to cut him down and release him. He earned a permanent place in the annals of failed executions, becoming known as \\"half-hanged Smith.\\"   My interest in this topic began with a look at physician involvement in executions. Alas, history is filled with examples of physicians who devise instruments of death. In the late 1700's, two French doctors, Joseph-Ignace Guillotin and Antoine Louise, developed the decapitation device originally known as the louisette, although guillotine is the name that stuck. In the doctors' day, French royalty and the upper classes had the privilege of the sword","excerpt":"the lower classes were subject to more gruesome executions. The guillotine was intended to be more humane.    In this country, physicians got into the act in the 1890's with formation of the New York Commission to Investigate and Report the Most Humane and Practical Method of Carrying Into Effect the Sentence of Death in Capital Cases. The commission reviewed a series of methods intended to replace hanging, including electrocution, cyanide poisoning, chloroform overdosing and intravenous injection of morphine.    The electric chair, favored by such notables as Thomas A. Edison, won out. Electric chairs were used in hundreds of executions over the next decades in the United States, but not without mishap.    Perhaps the most frightful blunder concerned Willie Francis, a \\"colored citizen of Louisiana,\\" convicted of murder in 1945 and sentenced to death. On May 3, 1946, the executioner threw the switch, but Francis got a jolt only large enough to scare him half to death. He was thereupon unstrapped and returned to his cell.    His lawyers, in a case that went before the Supreme Court, argued that a second attempt to execute him would violate constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment or double jeopardy. Willie Francis lost his case (Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 1947) and was executed by Louisiana on a second try.    The modern method of choice, lethal injection, has also withstood court challenges. In a bizarre case, death-row prisoners petitioned a Federal court to disallow the use of drugs in execution because such use had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which must ordinarily certify a drug's safety and efficacy (including drugs for animal euthanasia). The prisoners lost (Heckler v. Cheney, 105 S. Ct. 1649, 1985), and death by injection has become the preferred method in at least 18 states.   The rush to execution is going to get us back into some very bloody business. Doctors who doff their white coats for the black hoods of executioners betray their professional heritage. Newer methods of execution, cloaked in the respectability of medicine and science, are not necessarily improvements on older, seemingly more gruesome means.    As more high-tech methods assuage our consciences and anesthetize our sensibilities, they divert us from the reality of capital punishment. Capital punishment, however carried out, remains unworkable, reflecting a deep-seated race and class bias and constantly risking irreversible error in the execution of innocent defendants.

For this offering, which began a stand at the Globe on Saturday, mixes mayhem and clowning with the happy abandon of a drunk suffering from dementia praecox. As a result, this caricature of a hillbilly family, who combine the seamier attributes of the Jukes and the Jeeter Lesters, dilutes the effects of numerous laughs with an always incredible plot.The film's first half-hour is its most amusing, with Fred MacMurray as a wide-eyed investigator for a public opinion poll in search of a missing co-worker, wandering into the decrepit domicile of the Fleagles. Here he finds Grandma moribund from poisonous water administered by the rest of the addled crew. Grandma, it seems, knows where $70,000 stolen by her gun-moll granddaughter, Bonnie, is cached. The lethal concoction, it might be divulged, is the spring-board for most of this wild lampoon's guffaws. It causes its victims to glow. Grandma, asking the jittery MacMurray to extinguish the lamp so as to prove she is being poisoned, quietly passes out of the picture still gleaming as brightly as a Times Square sign. From there on the story carries our beleaguered hero and Helen Walker, the only other normal person in the area, in hectic chases through secret passages in the true tradition of the Keystone Kops.As the harridan mother of the sadistic tribe, which includes a pair of dim-witted twins, broadly played by Peter Whitney and Jean Heather, Marjorie Main rules the run-down roost with a stentorian voice and the lashes of her bull whip. And Porter Hall, as her third husband and nominal head of the clan, not only is \\"teched\\" but is a Ph. D. to boot.

Skillfully directed by Basil Dean and possessed of an exceptionally fine British cast, the drama must be rated one of the best that has come from England's studios.Basil Rathbone contributes an excellent performance as Ferdinand de Levis, the Shylock in modern dress of the Galsworthy work. Shylock has always had his sympathizers, those who felt that Portia, for all her cleverness, had cheated the Jew of what was rightfully his. De Levis gets his pound of flesh in this drama, but finds his triumph empty. It is a far more natural, a vastly less theatrical, ending.\\"Loyalties\\" tells the story of the wealthy London Jew, race conscious and race proud, eager for social prominence, venomous in meeting the sugared venom of those who tolerate him for his wealth. At an English house party, 1,000 pounds is stolen from his wallet. He suspects Captain Dancy, whose social position is much stronger than his credit rating. Inasmuch as de Levis's wealth has been the target of thinly veiled gibes earlier in the evening, he decides to have the game as well as the name of Shylock, and, unmoved by his host's talk of \\"esprit de corps among gentlemen,\\" insists flatly upon calling in the police.The showdown is averted for the time, but later, when de Levis has been blackballed at a British club, he spits out his accusations against Dancy in public.

The result is that Mr. Boyd as the redoubtable Mike Slade, conscienceless racketeering chieftain, goes down to defeat before Mr. Oakie as the amiable and irrepressible \\"Cyclone\\" Case, a small town tenderfoot whose success is owing to luck rather than wisdom.In spite of the shooting, kidnapping and efficacious use of a humble monkey wrench, this film is such a cheery entertainment that it afforded plenty of merriment to an audience at an early showing yesterday. On one side there is the business of the desperadoes and on the other the fortunate escapades of Mr. Case, who, incidentally, is so superstitious that he thinks that he ought to stay in bed clutching a rabbit's foot on the thirteenth of every month.In an early episode \\"Cyclone\\" Case saves Andrew Martine, a wealthy lawyer with a lovely daughter, from being run over by an automobile. Martine is profuse in his thanks to Case, and the latter, perceiving an opportunity to do a little business, suggests that the lawyer take out an insurance policy. Martine therefore signs an application for $100,000 accident insurance and \\"Cyclone\\" hops, skips and jumps back to his office manager, only to learn that the policy on Martine's life is too great a risk. For the lawyer, it appears, in severing business relations with Slade has incurred the wrath of that knave and stands in momentary danger of having his life snuffed out. As a matter of fact, one of Slade's henchmen was driving the automobile when Case came to the rescue.Slade then gives Martine another chance to do business with him. The lawyer, however, not only turns down the offer, but informs Slade that if anything should happen to him (Martine), Slade's full record Will be turned over to the police.Slade is not the type of man to let the grass grow under his feet. He confers with one of his gunmen and not long afterward Martine's daughter, Sylvia, is kidnapped. Thereupon the ingenuous Case decides to find Slade and force the desperado to free Sylvia. To help Case in his noble work, the author decides for Slade and his girl, Zella, to have a spat just as the smiling hero is entering the Café Monaco. Soon Zella and Case are beheld at the same table and Zella, understanding that Case is an, infant in arms when it comes to the ways of gangsters, gives the insurance agent the telephone number of a rival bad man and the innocent Case, without knowing what he is doing, informs Pete Caltek that Slade is paying off his men.In the course of further excitement, Case, armed only with a monkey wrench, invades Slade's own domicile, where the pretty Sylvia is hidden. His weapon is useful in laying low two or three men and eventually he discovers Sylvia. Shortly afterward the surprised Slade re turns to his dwelling with his gang and had it not been for the fortuitous arrival of the police, Slade's idea of having \\"Cyclone\\" Case prepared with bullets by the rival thugs might have been successful.Mr. Boyd gives another capital performance. Mr. Oakie is amusing. Jean Arthur officiates as Sylvia and Wynne Gibson is the vengeful Zella.On the surrounding program are Ted Lewis and his \\"Merry Musical Clowns\\" and also a stage production known as \\"Illustrations,\\" with Frank Gaby, Llora Hoffman and others.

If these gang and prison melodramas keep up, and they're bound to, we're dreadfully afraid that some day the lady with the sword and scales just won't be able to put forth that extra spurt at the finish. And then the villains will triumph, and who knows what will happen to the morals of our youth?But justice triumphs in \\"Women in Prison.\\" The gang boss, who sits—as usual—like a fat spider in his night-club headquarters, is shot down at last and confesses that he framed the warden's daughter into a ten-year manslaughter rap.

The many means of laying cable are generally expensive and unwieldly (creating a spaghetti factory of unmarked wires under the floor), and even after completion the various network operating systems might not be able to talk to each other. It's no wonder that network administrators are salivating over the promise of wireless LAN technology. In a wireless system, a network interface card (NIC) comes equipped with a transmitter/receiver (a miniature FM radio station) that allows it to talk to any other node on the network.   The problem with most wireless systems is that they are slower, in some cases much slower, than wired systems. (Wireless signals tend to \\"echo\\" and compensating for that cuts down on transmission speed.) Because wireless systems use radio frequencies for transmission, they are also prone to interference and -- more important to the security minded -- to interception. Wireless systems are also expensive. Most wireless NIC's are in the $1,000 range.  Regular interface cards cost less than $300.

It is also the least visible, since Apple does not plan to make it available until late January.   The new Mac Classic has a low price, but it lacks color, processing power and expandability","excerpt":"the Mac IIsi has all of these but its price is above the reach of many people in home offices or schools. The new LC falls in a happy middle ground as Apple's lowest-priced color Macintosh. It is also the most radical departure from conventional Macintosh design, with a low, slim profile that resembles a high-tech pizza box.   A Mac LC equipped with two megabytes of system memory, a 1.44-megabyte diskette \\"superdrive\\" and a 40-megabyte hard disk drive will have a list price of $2,499. List prices for Apple products are typically discounted 25 percent to 30 percent at retail, so one can expect to pay less than $1,800 for the LC. The price includes a keyboard and mouse but not a monitor. With Apple's 12-inch color monitor, the street price would still typically be less than $2,400, making the LC an extremely attractive alternative to comparably powered 386SX PC's.    Apple also introduced a new color monitor last week, the 12-inch RGB Display. At $599, the new color monitor is $400 less expensive than Apple's slightly larger 13-inch color display. The tradeoff is that the resolution of the 12-inch display -- the number of picture elements, or pixels, on screen -- is 512 dots horizontally by 384 vertically, as against 640 by 480 on the 13-inch model, so the 12-inch color model can display 36 percent less information.   On the other hand, the new monitor looks pretty good, unless one is accustomed to the sharper 13-inch model. And for the money, many people may decide that the extra pixels are unnecessary. If they change their minds, the Mac LC works with the 13-inch color monitor. It will not work with larger monitors without an optional video adapter.   So, for a discounted cost of less than $3,000, one can have a Macintosh system that is almost equivalent to the original Mac II color system, which sold for more than $6,500.   The LC uses the same 16-megahertz version of the Motorola 68020 chip used in the original Mac II back in 1987. Apple almost certainly chose to use the older 68020 chip to keep costs down and to keep the Mac LC from eating into sales of the more powerful (and profitable) Mac II family, but it sacrificed some power in doing so. People who need more power will probably prefer the new 68030-based Mac IIsi or its more powerful siblings, the IIci and the IIfx.    Home and school users, meanwhile, are likely to find the Mac LC more than sufficient. Apple officials said that the Mac LC has twice the performance of the Mac SE.    Potentially more significant is Apple's assertion that the Mac LC outperforms I.B.M.-style PC's based on the very popular Intel 386SX 16-MHz microprocessor. We have seen no independent benchmark tests to confirm or dispute this, but technical specifications alone are not enough to determine the better computer.   Unless the potential customer has a substantial investment in DOS-based software, the Mac LC will probably win a lot of people away from the 386SX machines. The Mac is much easier to set up and operate than standard PC's. If price and performance are roughly equal, as they appear to be, the Mac LC wins the contest simply because it is less aggravating to use.      Apple is developing a new plug-in card to let the Mac LC run software written for the Apple IIe in addition to its own Macintosh software. The price for the card, due in March, has been set at $199.     The Apple II family has been a mainstay in education for more than a decade, but it has now been overtaken by the march of technology. It is to Apple's credit that it has provided a bridge from the old technology to the new, instead of expecting its users to leap to a new standard.

This despite Shostakovich's orchestration and help on the film script and ample English subtitles. On the Cameo's screen the beauty, power and music of \\"Khovanschina's\\" parts are clearer and more impressive than the whole.Since the late seventeenth-century period on which Mussorgsky based his text was confused and near-chaotic, it is understandable that a dramatization of events in a Moscow riven by religious schisms, court intrigue and military and political power putsches would not be simple to stage or screen flowingly and lucidly. This \\"Khovanschina\\" is neither, but its strength is evident in the direction of Vera Stroyeva, who also collaborated on the script, in effectively using masses of people in choral groups and, occasionally, in individual scenes.A viewer may be confused as to the power plays of the boyars, led by Prince Ivan and his son","excerpt":"the machinations of the suspicious Prince Golitsyn; the cries of doom of the religious leader Dosipheir and his followers, and the landless, wandering peasantry voicing both doubt and hope. But Miss Stroyeva's cast is striking physically and vocally, and is able, now and again, to project effectively the drama of violently changing times.The opening scene of the Moscow boyars' tough soldiers, the Strelski, awakening to the sounds of bells is colorful and sonorous. Scenes of Moscow at dawn and dusk, with campfires lighting the river banks; a revel in the boyar's palace with the noted ballerina Maya Plisetskaya as the soloist, and a political clash of the nobles in Prince Golitsyn's palace are memorably reflective of the rough-hewn mores and culture of an awakening Russia.Suffice it to say that the performances, both physical and vocal, are a credit to operatic, if not accepted screen, style. It is obvious that these are robust and superbly trained voices. This is especially notable in the outstanding bass renditions of Mark Reizen, as Dosiphei, the Dissenter, and of the performances of Alexei Krivchenya, as Prince Khovansky; Kira Leonova, as the decorative, ill-fated Marfa, and Vladimir Petrov, as the handsome Prince Golitsyn.\\"Khovanschina\\" rarely has been sung here, since it first was staged by the Metropolitan Opera company in 1950. But, if the Mosfilm company and Miss Stroyeva, who previously filmed Mussorgsky's \\"Boris Gudonov,\\" have not come up with a \\"Khovanschina\\" impressive enough to cause the Met to change its schedules, they at least have given us a closer, more colorful view of an uneven work that deserves respect and some attention.

But recently some have become convinced that computers are also having an impact on content and quality. Shakespeare, they assert, might have composed his work differently had he used a sonnet processor instead of a quill pen.   The notion is intriguing. With electrons and phosphors, the personal computer enables writers to cast and recast sentences more readily, to shuffle and insert new paragraphs with ease. And with the proper program, spelling and grammar can be checked automatically. The mechanical benefits are undeniable.   \\"God looked down at the writers and said, 'I haven't done anything for these people for a long time, hundreds of years, so I'm going to make up for it,' \\" said Frank Conroy, director of the Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa. \\"The word processor saves so much time and drudgery in editing and rewriting.\\" Less Care, Not More?    These advantages ought to result in more polished prose. There is concern, however, that writers may actually put less thought and care into an electronic composition.    Marcia Peoples Halio of the University of Delaware in Newark touched off a debate on this in 1990 with her observation, printed in the journal Academic Computing, that freshman English students in classes using Macintosh computers wrote papers that were noticeably inferior to papers composed by freshmen of what she described as presumably equal skills using MS-DOS computers.   Ms. Halio, assistant director of the University Writing Center, said she and several colleagues had noticed that students in the Macintosh-based English classes in general chose relatively trivial essay topics, committed more punctuation, spelling and grammar errors (despite the checking devices) and wrote shorter, less complex sentences.   At the time of her observations, the command systems for PC and Macintosh computers were very different","excerpt":"the Macintosh was much more \\"user friendly,\\" with mouse-driven point-and-click menus, fancy type fonts and graphics and easier text-manipulation tools, than the DOS-based systems, which functioned as simple electric typewriters.   Many academics dismissed Ms. Halio's report as unscientific and attacked her methodology. But in the intervening three years, no academic study has rebutted -- or supported -- her thesis. Meanwhile, the focus of the debate has shifted away from the Mac-versus-PC controversy -- in part because the two competing platforms are now using similar command systems and have similar capabilities -- and toward the more important issue of whether computers affect the quality of composition.   \\"The technologies are powerful and change the way we perceive tasks,\\" Ms. Halio said in a recent interview. \\"And while I'm obviously committed to using computers to teach, I want to pay attention to what's happening to the students and their work.\\"   Certainly, writing is a highly personal and in many cases ritualistic act, so whatever tool the writer uses, there will be many compositional styles. The question becomes, how is a composition affected by technology?   \\"For beginning writers or tyros, there is the tendency to be prolix, which the machine for one reason or another tends to encourage,\\" Mr. Conroy said. \\"The computer empowers bad writers to more easily churn out a lot of pages.\\" 'Curst Hard Reading'    The 18th-century playwright Richard Sheridan, using a state-of-the-art quill processor, seems to have anticipated this criticism when he wrote: \\"You write with ease to show your breeding, but easy writing's curst hard reading.\\"    And the humorist Russell Baker, in a New York Times column in 1985, noted the not-so-subtle effect that word processing had on his own writing process.   \\"It is so easy, not to mention so much fun -- listen folks,\\" Mr. Baker wrote. \\"I have just switched right here at the start of this very paragraph you are reading -- right there I switched from the old typewriter (talk about goose-quill pen days!) to my word processor, which is now clicking away so quietly and causing me so little effort that I don't think I'll ever want to stop this sentence because, well, why should you want to stop a sentence when you're really well launched into the thing -- the sentence, I mean -- and it's so easy just to keep her rolling right along and never stop since, anyhow, once you do stop, you are going to have to start another sentence, right? -- which means coming up with another idea.\\"   But the difference with electronic composition may go deeper, said John Slatin, director of the English Department's computer research laboratory at the University of Texas in Austin. \\"I'm quite sure that if Shakespeare were living in the late 20th century and writing with a word processor,\\" Mr. Slatin said, \\"the nature of what he would write would be quite different than what the writer in the 16th or 17th century produced using a quill pen.\\"    Mr. Slatin was among more than a dozen academicians, representing institutions as diverse as Yale University and Jackson Community College in Michigan, who called for more research on the topic as a result of Ms. Halio's initial report. Technology in Culture    Why would there be a difference? \\"Because the technology is embedded in the culture,\\" Mr. Slatin said, \\"and because it also allows people to do certain things that other technologies don't.\\"   Fred Kemp, director of composition at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, says he believes that computer networks, not just the computers, are helping to create better writers. \\"The way to really get writers writing well is to get them engaged and interested, and that means getting them readers,\\" Mr. Kemp said. \\"Networks produce readers for our writers.\\"   The network itself is a publishing medium, even if the \\"papers\\" written on it are electronic, Mr. Kemp said. A student's writing can be published on a network that can connect different classes, different schools, different states and even different countries. Networks also allow easy two-way communication, so that writers can get feedback through electronic mail.   \\"As you teach students to read critically, they are also learning to write,\\" Mr. Kemp said. \\"It's a completely different kind of dynamic.\\" Computer Words: Less Perfect?"},{"year":"1984","title":"DAVID E.

One can't spend as much time failing as fishermen do without nurturing some mighty dream of better days","excerpt":"the magic that attracts us to books about fishing is the revealed wisdom, whether ancient and long lost or recently discovered. Though we pride ourselves  on our pragmatism, most of us harbor at times a very nearly occult obsession with some imagined higher awareness, a state of knowing that will give us the right lure, the right bait, the right rod, the right profanity -- whatever it is that we're plainly not using now will be revealed to us, and we will become that most envied and lionized of fishermen, the expert. (I have fished with actual experts, and they really do catch at least twice as many fish as I do, which is  to say that they spend 98, rather than 99, percent of their time catching nothing.) \\n\\n     This year we celebrate the 500th anniversary of the tradition of books about  fishing. In 1496, the printer Wynkyn de Worde of Westminster published a new edition of \\"The Boke of St. Albans,\\" a compendium of advice on field sports first published 10 years earlier. To increase its popularity, he added a shorter work titled \\"The Treatise of Fishing With an Angle.\\" He placed this remarkable essay in the larger work, he explained, to prevent its falling into \\"the hands of each idle person which would desire it if it were imprinted alone by itself.\\" Gentlemen who could afford to buy the bigger book were a better bet to behave themselves than the riffraff who could buy a little pamphlet. The 1496 \\"Treatise,\\" though not published separately until the early 1530's, has long been heralded as our first fishing book.

But coming on the heels of the forward-looking shows in Paris, the American shows for the most part lacked the slight silhouette changes and the imaginative accessorizing that nudge fashion forward. It was especially disappointing that several of the newer talents who had brought excitement to the last season settled for doing the same stuff over again in winter fabrics.   The reluctance of so many American designers and manufacturers to go off into uncharted territories, though regrettable, was understandable. These collections had been produced amid the uncertainties of the Persian Gulf war. More important, the fact that the recession had already cut deeply into the retail and fashion industry and still showed no sign of receding made the status quo a safer route.

In the garden, flowers bloom and birds chirp, and at table, father complains jovially that mother never remembers to serve grapes. Just then, the teen-age son reaches over and plucks a bunch of grapes out of a bowl, tossing them playfully at his sister. So there isn't any trouble in paradise, after all.\\"Hah!\\" director Giovanna Gagliardo means to say. All this wonderfulness is merely a sham. The beautiful mother (Carla Gravina), who wears pearls to chop carrots in her elegant kitchen, has absolutely nothing of consequence to do, so she pads about the palazzo in a near-stupor, occasionally stopping to prepare an elaborate meal.Though the mother expresses little, she is actually engaged in an age-old struggle with her young daughter, whom the mother would like to keep dependent forever. We know this because the daughter is symbolically crippled, walking gingerly with a cane that has a silver handle.The film, which is part of the New Directors-New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art, more or less takes place on one day. But the daughter is sometimes crippled and sometimes not, sometimes an adolescent and sometimes a child; figments of the mother's memory or imagination wander in at will.\\"Mother and Daughter\\" never lets a scene go by quietly when an intrusive blast of directorial technique will do, and so it becomes impossible for the viewer to care a fig about either the sleepwalking mother or her half-imaginary child. Miss Gagliardo's insights into the mother-daughter struggle are so slight, and her direction so over-bearing, that the results suggest what might happen if an infantry unit were called in to kill a bat.As a director, Miss Gagliardo is distressingly insensitive to the relationship between style and purpose. As an interior director, however, she is formidable. The film is gorgeously photographed, from sunny beginning to profoundly uneventful ending, and everything in the villa is bright and gleaming and just-so. One need only imagine that the setting is Beverly Hills rather than Italy, and that instead of listlessly chopping vegetables the mother is giving a few passionless flicks to her Cuisinart, to imagine just how ineffectual this numbingly glamorous parable really is.

By HENRY SCOTT STOKES   O ne of the best-kept ''secrets'' from foreigners is that there are two quite different Japans. The first, like the Tokyo region, is dotted with factories, crisscrossed by bullet trains and ultramodern in appearance. The other is north of the east-west mountainous backbone of the main island of Honshu and faces the Korean peninsula. In this Japan there is little industry and the people are slow of pace, especially in winter. And winter, when the wild duck that is the specialty of the region appears on the tables of the country inns, is the time for a gourmet tour.   Few foreigners visit this part of Japan because there's not much to see - with one great exception. At Izumo there is the Shinto shrine dedicated to Okuninushi-no-mikoto, a deity traditionally thought to have introduced medicine, sericulture (raising of silkworms) and agriculture.

''I love it like a son,'' Miss Wertmuller said of her novel during a recent visit to New York.

She remembered that she had not thought it would be that much different from what she had been doing.

ABOUT BOOKS AND AUTHORS"},{"year":"2005","title":"EVER since major jazz labels began to shrink their rosters in the late 90's, the average consumer hasn't really been able to hear what's happening in the small New York clubs. (Maybe contemporary jazz is moving toward a position of having no average consumers, but that's another issue.) Over the last five years, one of the best musicians to make his home in places like Fat Cat and the Up Over Jazz Cafe has been the young pianist Robert Glasper. He has regularly been great, starting out from powerful, precise expositions of theme and then expanding his area of play, always followed closely by his trio. But the grapevine has its limits: unless you're a New York jazz musician, or you hang out with them, you've probably never heard him. ''Canvas,'' which comes out on Oct. 4, is actually his second album, after ''Mood,'' which appeared two years ago on the Spanish label Fresh Sound. The new recording is on the much more visible Blue Note label, and it shows Mr. Glasper doing what he has done, more or less, in those shows, and that is good. There will be time later to build concepts","excerpt":"the main thing is to get a representative sample of his rolling pulse in improvisations, his sputter of ideas within the close watchwork movements of his regular trio, with Vicente Archer on bass and Damion Reid on drums. Mr. Glasper owes a debt to Herbie Hancock, as do most mainstream jazz pianists who came along in the last three decades, and he doesn't hide it in the album's pretty harmonic changes. But laid thickly over any secondary stuff is his own jittery, hip-hop-altered sense of groove.

[ D1. ]   Prices of Treasury notes and bonds fell as the stock market returned to stability, but credit market participants said the drop was of minimal significance.  [ D16. ]   The dollar fell against most foreign currencies, but traders said the slide was moderated by the stock market rebound.

Yes, it is possible. But only until 1999.  [ D1. ]   Czechoslovakia plans to give ordinary citizens stock-buying coupons for big nationalized industries.

But they were still struggling over Shiite autonomy and the role of Islam in family disputes, including allowing clerics in the judiciary and women's rights.  A1    U.S. General on Rebuilding Iraq  An American general who commanded 38,000 soldiers in the securing and rebuilding of Baghdad writes in a new essay that success in Iraq cannot be achieved solely by training local security forces. Instead, he says, the military must also work to provide essential city services, create jobs and promote local governmental control.  A5    Youth React to Pope's Speech  At the Mass of World Youth Day, Pope Benedict XVI seemed to enjoy himself as he made strides on this first trip abroad in defining his papacy. But the emotional charge that Catholics became accustomed to from 26 years of Pope John Paul II, scores of young people said, was less evident in this less extroverted, more cerebral pope.

Instead of connecting with neighbors, new ruralism promotes connecting with the land, though these cabins in the woods come with wireless Internet access and porches with screens that unfurl by remote control.  A11    Split Over Confirmation Tactics  Before senators begin questioning the Supreme Court nominee, John G. Roberts Jr., the debate over his confirmation is becoming a test of Senate Democrats as well. The party's liberal base is pressing for a vigorous fight against Judge Roberts as documents from the Reagan administration clarify his conservative credentials. But some Democrats are reluctant to join in on the criticism of his record.  A8    Tribute for Hunter S. Thompson  Hunter S. Thompson's cremated remains were blasted into the sky over his farm in Colorado, boosted by red, blue and silver fireworks around a 153-foot monument that Mr. Thompson, the writer and avatar of ''gonzo'' journalism, designed himself almost 30 years ago.  A8    Accusations at U.S.O.  Just as the U.S.O is increasing efforts to support soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, it has been roiled by internal concerns over its management practices. Several U.S.O. officials complain that the organization's president, Edward Powell, has given an unusual amount of power over the internal management of the U.S.O. to a major contractor, a man who has family ties to Mr. Powell.

A1    Wal-Mart Tries Again  Wal-Mart, after being rebuffed in its first effort, is trying again to open a store in New York City, and this time it hopes that New Yorkers who shop at its stores outside the city will flock to its cause.  B1    Old Weapons, New Enemies  The fight over the survival of the Navy's submarine base in Groton, Conn., has underscored a broader debate: just how many submarines are essential in the post-cold war, terrorism-focused, budget-restricted military?

Count Stauffenberg placed his briefcase beneath the table a few feet from Hitler and left the meeting to take a prearranged telephone call from an aide. Moments later the briefcase exploded, killing two members of Hitler's staff and badly wounding a half dozen others.  But Hitler, the seat blown out of his trousers, his coat ripped up the back, both eardrums ruptured, survived the blast.

For this spy story, which came to the Gotham from England on Saturday, is weighed down by enough fanciful plot and flamboyant dialogue to serve half a dozen minor melodramas. Neither is it surprising that Mr. Walbrook, though he is a sturdy thespian, is not up to providing the incredible energy required by a rather incredible yarn. Oddly enough, its thrills and suspense are only mild and intermittent.Mr. Walbrook, it may have been gathered, leads an active life. As a Loyalist officer he escapes from Spain to France with the remnants of his company and is clapped into a Vichy internment camp. Sent to the Sahara with a slave labor detail, he escapes again, this time with a document containing the names of trusted citizens of Morocco, a list the Allies sorely need apparently. In London, which city he reaches in an unexplained fashion, he outwits his pursuers, the Allies get the papers and Walbrook returns to the desert to free his comrades. A Spanish lady with whom he has fallen in love and a renegade French officer who hates our hero keep turning up to comfort and harry him in these varied places.Walbrook manages to give the most convincing portrayal of the cast, although he is shackled by such archaic lines as \\"You lying swine!\\", delivered with gusto to the villain. The latter is played to the hilt by Reginald Tate, while Margaretta Scott, as Walbrook's romantic interest, has little to do but look frightened and tearful.

They trouble any society they support: like feet, the more they are weighed down by their owners the more pain they give.In East Germany and Poland the authorities treat them with a special deference. Even in its harsher times the Franco regime was never able to stop them from striking. Laws against assembly were useless. A hammer would stop a mile below ground","excerpt":"the man in the next chamber would go to see what the matter was; the silence would spread and a line of stubborn, blackened men came to the surface and stayed until the Government could figure out some way of getting them back down.Miners' strength, their assertiveness and solidarity are based largely on their economic power; and where coal-mining becomes marginal to the economy of a region, they lose much of their ability to fight. There is another factor, though. Miners in their tunnels, vulnerable to explosions, cave-ins and destroyed lungs, weigh on a society's conscience as well as its economy. Their grievances command an instinctive respect.One of the reasons for the defeat of Prime Minister Edward Heath in Britain two years ago was a widespread feeling that in choosing the miners as the target for his austerity fight he had picked just the wrong target.\\"Harlan County, U.S.A.,\\" to be shown tonight and tomorrow at the New York Film Festival in Alice Tully Hall, is a full-length documentary of the year-long strike carried on by the miners at the Brookside works in eastern Kentucky. It has flaws, some of them considerable, but it is a fascinating and moving work. Its strength lies chiefly in its ability to illuminate the peculiar frightfulness and valor of coal-mining, and made it clear just why coal-miners can never be rightly treated as a less than a very special case.Barbara Kopple and her photographers have got right inside the life of the miners and their families in their long struggle against the operators of the Brookside mine and its parent company, the Duke Power Company. It is a brilliantly detailed report from one side of a battle that caused one death, several shootings and a flood of violent bitterness; and that brought back to Harlan County memories of the much-bloodier coal strikes of the early 1930's.The strike began after the miners voted to join the United Mine Workers of America—which had lost its hold in eastern Kentucky—and the owners refused to sign a standard U.M.W. contract. It was not until more than a yaer later—after the violence had claimed the life of one striker — that Duke Power, under strong pressure from Federal mediators, agreed to sign.The film shows the picketing, the use of state troopers to keep the road open for nonstrikers, the confrontations, a shooting, the efforts of the strikers and their families to remain organized and united through the long year. It intercuts old footage from the 1931 strike, where five miners were killed. It also details the successful battle of reformers to oust the old national leadership of the U.M.W.; and the support given to the Harlen County strike by the new leadership under Arnold R. Miller.Some of the thematic interweaving is awkward, but this is more than made up for by the extraordinary intimacy Miss Kopple has achieved with the strikers and with the bitter life of the strike. There is an old miner, lungs torn by coal dust, who makes our chests hurt as he talks. There are frightening scenes of tight-lipped strike-breakers, guns openly displayed rushing through the pickets. There is a terrifying night scene where shots are fired and we see the leader of the strike-breakers brandishing a pistol in the cab of his pick-up truck. There is a heartbreaking scene where the mother of the slain miner collapses at his wake. There is much more, equally good.The film is entirely partisan. Considering that the company's refusal to sign a contract was condemned by the National Labor Relations Board as a pretext not to recognize the union and considering that the film itself is forthrightly an effort to see the struggle through the miners' own eyes, this is no real drawback. Perhaps there is some skimping: it is something of a cinematic trick to film the President of Duke Power in such tight closeup that his face completely fills the screen.More serious are the sometimes questionable ways in which the film advances its message: that the Harlan strike is only part of a struggle, and that the miners must go on struggling and striking. The instance I am thinking of comes in its suggestion that the reformist leadership of the U.M.W. may ave sold out in 1974—after the Harlan County strike was over—by recommending acceptance of a national mine contract that curtails local strikes.The film does not call this a sell-out—it uses no narration at all and conveys its message by its editing—but all reactions of individual miners that it shows before the vote are negative. Yet the membership ratified the contract by 44,000 to 34,000. The film states this, to be sure; yet somehow all the faces we have learned to admire during the long Harlan County struggle seem to push us to feel toward Mr. Miller the same way we felt toward the recalcitrant mine owners.

It has ingenious twists, but the pity is that the narrative was not fashioned as a rigid, ironical drama, instead of as a mixture of half-hearted seriousness and for the most part extravagant levity.Just before midnight by Big Ben there are beheld the various passengers on a London bus. There are","excerpt":"the man who boasts of his knowledge of art, the girl who tears up a man's photograph, the brainless individual who has had his pocket picked, and a man who willingly gives him a copper for his fare; an elderly, anxious woman, and a shipping clerk who is looking forward to a Mediterranean trip with his wife.Now and again the director gives glimpses of Big Ben as the bus speeds on through a storm. Suddenly, just before the hour of midnight booms, lightning strikes a crane, the bus driver turns quickly and his vehicle crashes into a store. The narrative then takes up what the various passengers had been doing prior to the accident on that Friday the 13th.After a while one learns the reason for the anxious expression on the elderly woman's face and what the man, who talked about art, really meant. It may be decided that the scamp who lost his wallet well deserved to do so and that another passenger, whom it is unnecessary to designate, sports an Eton tie but has spent most of his time in prison. As the various incidents are unfurled, other characters in whom the passengers on the bus were interested are introduced.The dialogue is slipshod and there are those annoying times when the Albions persist in employing American colloquialisms; although the actors are thoroughly competent, such lines seem to stump them. There are also moments when the scenes are little more than buffoonery. What the story actually needed was the same treatment as was given to the play, \\"Sin Flood,\\" and other offerings, such as \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey,\\" which have dealt with a theme akin to that of \\"Friday the 13th.\\"Among the cast of 25 are several of Britain's conspicuously good players. There is Sonnie Hale, who is all very well in the right light story, but here his general comic demeanor as a bus conductor actually influences the story and this is not what is wanted. Edmund Gwenn, who did so well in \\"The Good Companions,\\" is too hard worked a comedian in this offering. Donald Calthrop lends interest to the rôle of a reprehensible stage producer, and Jessie Matthews is attractive and capable as a dancing girl who is in love with a schoolmaster.

Mr. Veloso, who opens a five-night engagement at the Ballroom (253 West 28th Street, Chelsea) this evening, is a Renaissance man of music in the way his songs span many genres.

The new line, called Waiver Savers, allows customers to purchase only as much coverage as they need, instead of being forced to choose between buying full coverage or none at all.   For those not covered by their own auto insurance policy, Alamo is still offering its full collision-damage protection, but for $9 no matter the size of the car, which is as much as $4 less than its previous price for such coverage. The Waiver Saver 3000 option, $6 a day, protects the renter from all damage liability up to $3,000. It allows business travelers to cover the personal liability stipulated in many corporate rental contracts without purchasing the more expensive full coverage on the full value of the car. The third choice, Mini Waiver Saver 500, $3 a day, covers the renter's deductible without duplicating coverage provided by the renter's own auto insurance policy.    After testing the new program for eight months in Florida and Hawaii, Alamo began offering the plan throughout the country on Dec. 1, except in Illinois, New York, Indiana and Texas, because of those states' regulations of damage waivers. Nature Preserve For Puerto Rico    Visitors to Puerto Rico can add a new stop to their itineraries in mid-February, when the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico opens the Cabezas de San Juan Nature Preserve.  The 316-acre site, which is surrounded on three sides by the Atlantic Ocean on Puerto Rico's northeastern tip, is being preserved by the conservation group because of its unusually diverse tropical ecosystem.    Forest land, mangroves, lagoons, beaches, cliffs, offshore keys and coral reefs are all represented. Another attraction in the preserve, a 110-year-old lighthouse built by the Spanish and now operated by the United States Coast Guard, offers sweeping views of El Yunque rain forest to the west, and across the Caribbean as far as St. Thomas. In Puerto Rico, the nature preserve is known as El Faro (the lighthouse).   The site is part of 5,000 acres that have been acquired by the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico, which was created in 1970 by the governments of the United States and Puerto Rico to protect the island's most important ecological and historic land. The preserve is a 45-minute drive from San Juan, and several hotels will offer day excursions. Tentatively, the area will be open Tuesday to Sunday, with admission $4. Reservations (809-722-5834) will be required. Denmark to Get Casinos on Jan. 1    As the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve, slot machines will ring and roulette wheels spin as two casinos in Denmark open their doors, making them the first legal gambling establishments in Scandinavia.

Mozart Exhibit In Vienna     VIENNA -- The largest exhibition of Mozart memorabilia ever assembled opened in Vienna Dec. 5, the 199th anniversary of the composer's death in the Austrian capital. The show, \\"Magic Melodies -- Mozart in Vienna,\\" is taking place in the Kunstlerhaus, 5 Karlsplatz (phone 587-96-63), the 125-year-old Renaissance revival art palace a five-minute walk from the State Opera.   Among the 843 items on display are portraits of Mozart, his relatives and friends; instruments on which he played; original scores; letters; sketches and models of the stage sets in which he saw his operas performed, and exhibits related to Mozart's association with Gluck, Haydn, Beethoven, his librettist da Ponte and leading singers.   The exhibition, a highlight of the Mozart bicentennial year, runs until Sept. 15, 1991. Hours: 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. daily; admission is about $7. No extra charge will be made for musical performances held in the exhibition building every Sunday morning. -- PAUL HOFMANN Ecotourism Debate at Sea    Passengers on a cruise in the Indian Ocean next month are invited to participate in an environmental conference to be held on the ship. The conference is being sponsored aboard Salen Lindblad's Caledonian Star, by the Oceanites Foundation, an environmental group based in Maryland that developed an Antarctic traveler's code. John Heminway, chairman of the African Wildlife Foundation, conservationists from Kenya and Tanzania and other experts will discuss the problems of integrating conservation and tourism in Africa. The Caledonian Star departs Mombasa, Kenya, Jan. 15, and ends in Madagascar. The conference will be held on the second and third days of the 15-day voyage. Nonsmokers' Cars and Buses     Hertz says it will designate about four out of five of its rental cars for nonsmokers in 1991. The cars will be identified for nonsmokers by decals in the cars and tags on the key chains. If a customer has smoked in a nonsmoker, the company says, the car will be taken out of the nonsmoking fleet and replaced by a new car. The company says it will not be able to guarantee a nonsmoking car at time of reservation.    A ban on smoking on London's buses beginning next Feb. 14 means that lighting up will be forbidden on almost all public transport in the capital. Smoking is currently permitted at the rear of the upper deck of double-decker buses. The rule has often caused overcrowding on the lower deck because many nonsmokers prefer to avoid sitting upstairs. Smoking is already banned on single-decker buses, on the London Underground and on much of British Rail's suburban services. Thai Warning    Americans traveling to northern Thailand are warned by the State Department that bandits and armed drug traffickers pose a threat in certain areas along the Thai-Burmese border. Because of this, a travel advisory from the department says, trekking in the northern parts of Chiangmai, Chiangrai and Mae Khong Son Provinces should be avoided. Americans contemplating trekking are advised to contact the United States Consulate in Chiangmai for an assessment of the current situation and the names of specific areas known to be dangerous.   The advisory adds that travel to the more populated areas of the three provinces is safe. LONDON SHOWS EVOKE INDIA    The comprehensive collection of Indian art and artifacts at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London is now displayed in the museum's new Nehru Gallery. The collection comprises 35,000 objects, some dating to 200 B.C.   A representative selection of the collection, drawn from the period 1550 to 1900, is on permanent display and includes paintings, sculpture, textiles and decorative arts. Other work will be changed regularly. The permanent display focuses first on the establishment of the Mogul dynasty in the 16th century and moves on to show the effect of European colonial rule on Indian art. Indian music will be played and storytelling will take place occasionally in the raised central pavilion.    Also in London, until March 17 the National Portrait Gallery has an exhibition called \\"The Raj, India and the British 1600-1947.\\" The exhibition examines the relationship between British and Indian society from the founding of the East India Company in 1600 to the withdrawal of the British and partition.   The Victoria and Albert Museum on Cromwell Road in South Kensington is open 10 A.M. to 5:50 P.M. Monday to Saturday, and 2:30 to 5:50 P.M. Sunday. Closed Dec. 24 to 27 and Jan. 1.
