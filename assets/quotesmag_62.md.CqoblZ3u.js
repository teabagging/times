The Federal Bureau of Investigation warned six men three weeks ago that their names had been found on a handwritten list in an address book found among scores of papers seized during a search of the home of the accused killer, El Sayyid A. Nosair, 35 years old, of Cliffside Park, N.J., the officials said.    The F.B.I. offered to provide guards to the officials as a precaution, but high-ranking agency officials said yesterday that they were more certain than ever that Mr. Nosair had acted alone and was not part of a larger conspiracy.    The list included two Federal judges in Brooklyn and a former assistant United States attorney who played roles in extraditing Mahmoud Atta, a suspected member of the Abu Nidal terrorist organization, to Israel, where he is to stand charges in an attack on a bus in 1986 in which the driver was killed and a passenger wounded.  Threats of Attack     Mr. Atta, who also uses the name Mahmoud El-Abed Ahmad, was arrested on a flight from Venezuela to New York three years ago and was extradited on Oct. 27, a week before the Kahane assassination.    The Abu Nidal organization repeatedly said it would respond to the extradition with an attack on American interests, and the State Department issued an unusual warning to travelers in late October, saying it took the threats seriously, a State Department official said yesterday.    Rabbi Kahane, a militant Zionist who advocated pushing Arabs out of Israel, was killed on Nov. 5 after speaking at a meeting of a pro-Israel group in a mid-Manhattan hotel.    Law-enforcement officials said the existence of the list, first reported in New York Newsday yesterday, did not suggest that Mr. Nosair, an Egyptian who friends described as an Islamic fundamentalist, was connected to Abu Nidal or any other terrorist organization. They also played down theories that the people on the list were assassination targets, pointing out that Mr. Nosair clipped dozens of news articles on Middle Eastern affairs and made copious notes to himself. \\"To say it was a hit list is stretching it,\\" a high-ranking police official said.  Photo of Congressman     The list was written in neat pen strokes on the first page of a 3-by-5-inch address book printed as a promotion by a bank, law-enforcement officials said.

Korman of the Eastern District of New York; a former assistant United States attorney, Jacques Simmelman, and Howard Adelman, a columnist for The Jewish Press. There was also the name of a sixth man involved in the judicial proceeding against Mr. Atta. His name has not been made public.    Pasted over the names was a picture of Mr. Ackerman cut from a New York Newsday article printed on Aug. 4, in which the Congressman urged President Bush to extradite Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite leader from southern Lebanon, to the United States from Israel to stand trial on charges that he helped to kidnap and kill Marine Lieut. Col. William Higgins in 1989. The Congressman is the only person on the list who had nothing to do with the extradition of Mr. Atta.    Mr. Ackerman said yesterday that he was not convinced that Mr. Nosair acted alone and that he took the possibility that he would be the target of violence seriously. \\"I don't know if it's a murderer's list or anything like this,\\" he said. \\"I assume he didn't have my picture on it for any great purpose.

Set in ''Ashville,'' a small town between Providence and Boston, this ambitious, sad little novel describes the temporary conjunction of four rootless lives. After the rector of the local Episcopalian church commits suicide, Lachlan St. George, a young minister from a prosperous Boston family, arrives as a replacement. He quickly meets the other actors in this quiet drama - the sweet-voiced teen-aged soloist of the church choir, an itinerant auto mechanic and a divorced, college-educated mother living on welfare. All of them are unsure of their desires, unfocused in their ambitions. Born elsewhere, they feel unwelcome in the closed society of the old New England town. As they fumble in their attempts to find solace in love - and direction for their lives - their frustration deepens and becomes volatile. Eventually, one dies an unrecognized martyr's death","excerpt":"two flee south. And St. George, the only one of the four initially convinced of his faith's sturdiness and support, discovers that he, after all, is lost. In the unsettled world of America's middle class, as Fanny Howe protrays it, the unfulfilled promises of 1960's progressive politics, the ''liberation'' of women and the equivocal ''I'm-O.K.-you're-O.K.'' position of the clergy have created a confusion of values and expectations. Her characters suffer acutely from the absence of new systems of guidance and reassurance to replace traditional social structures, and their uncertainty has fatal consequences. Unfortunately, Mrs. Howe stylizes her story with irregularities of format and punctuation that must be intended to evoke in her readers feelings of dislocation comparable to those suffered by her characters.

Ryan's game was all the more thrilling for the fact that at 44 years old -- he is also the oldest pitcher to throw a no-hitter -- he gave one of his strongest performances ever. Summing up a game in which two-thirds of his 122 pitches were strikes, Ryan said, \\"This is my most overpowering night.\\" Henderson, too, had something more than just another record. At 32, he had stolen more bases in 12 years than Brock did in 19, and did it in 1,000 or so fewer games. Brock, who was on hand to help celebrate, said the new record holder was \\"the greatest competitor that ever ran the bases.\\" Henderson, never one to let praise go unimproved-upon, said, \\"Brock is the symbol of great base stealing, but I'm the greatest of all time.\\" Headliners","excerpt":"Two for the Records"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: Robert A.

Don't be put off by that misleading title: Manuel Poirier's road movie is actually set in western France, where two funny and hapless outsiders wind up joining forces and embarking on a wonderfully droll journey.    The story begins when a salesman from Spain is outsmarted by a wily little Russian hitchhiker.    It's an introduction that hardly has the makings of a beautiful friendship. But that's exactly what develops in a funny, romantic film filled with cozy intimacies and lovely, wide-screen images of the French countryside.    Looking for love, these two lonely travelers find it in the most sweetly unpredictable ways. Audiences are liable to fall in love, too.      ''Western'' is playing at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, Broadway at 63d Street, Manhattan, (212) 757-2280, and at the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-8800.

''Two for the Road'' and ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith,'' though seriously flawed, do their best to return the genre to its cosmopolitan priorities.      Stanley Donen's 1967 ''Two for the Road'' was his attempt to bring to Hollywood some of the narrative experimentation of the era's European films. It cuts among 10 years of Continental vacations taken by a British couple, played by Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn (top right). It follows them -- in unchronological order -- from poor, hitchhiking youngsters blissfully in love to prosperous, settled, deeply unhappy spouses. Frederic Raphael's script mixes whimsy and lightness with cynicism and brittleness, and the result sometimes feels self-satisfied and, in the scenes with Eleanor Bron and William Daniels as an American couple, smug. But visually the picture, shot by Christopher Challis, is a chic delight, and it gets under your skin, maybe because Hepburn and Mr. Finney, both terrific, are such a plausible mismatch. Like Mr. Donen's ''Charade,'' it's one of the few studio films of the 60's that doesn't feel mummified.

BRIDGE: TOURNEY PLAYS","excerpt":"Two Interesting Examples From National Competition Just Ended in St. Louis"},{"year":"1931","title":"DER Raub der Mona Lisa\\" (The Theft of the Mona Lisa)—a moving picture with an original plot idea! The reaction of the critic is to rush out and call a meeting of earnest thanksgiving for this unique gift of the gods. Not that there are not plenty of novel ideas displayed in the making of films. Actors occasionally have a few and directors are overstuffed with them. But if a scenario writer proposes an original theme, it has to go through the mill of the scenario conferences, the objections of the production managers, the revisions of the director and the demands of the leading players. So it usually comes out squashed back into one of the old formulas. All the more credit to the Superfilm that they let Walter Reisch's manuscript get through so completely intact.For in this \\"Mona Lisa\\" film the \\"hero\\" is no hero at all, and the \\"heroine\\" is anything but that. The chief male figure is a sympathetic but very weak and sentimental young man, while the female is attractive but quite cold-hearted. And there is no lingering embrace to close the picture—the hero gets a jail sentence and the heroine a nice stinging moral slap in the face.Steals Mona Lisa.In detail, the story is this: A young Italian glazier living in Paris is commissioned to set glass over the Mona Lisa and is fascinated by the picture. A new maid in the house opposite him has a very strong resemblance to the woman of the painting and the youth falls in love with her. The girl is interested in him, as she believes him to be a rich young artist, but drops him immediately she finds out his real position in life. In order to do something to impress her, he steals the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. But she does not believe that he is the thief and goes away with a traveling salesman. Although the police are up in the air about the robbery, an agent sent by an American millionaire to buy the painting ferrets out the thief and makes him a stupendous offer for the picture. But he turns it down and sets out on a crazy journey to Italy with the painting strapped to a hurdy-gurdy. He offers the picture to a dealer in Florence for a paltry sum, but the American agent, who has been following him, now notifies the police, and he is arrested. The girl learns from the papers that he really did steal the painting for her and appears in the court room, hoping to be made the centre of interest by his confession. But when the youth does speak, he states that his reason for the theft was to be revenged on Napoleon, who had stolen so many works of art from Italy. Although the judges have to sentence him, the Italians believe and make a hero of him. And the girl is left completely out of it, her vanity deeply wounded.And how charmingly Gezy von Bolvary, the director of \\"Zwei Herzen im Dreiviertel Takt,\\" has set this story onto the screen! It is always light and pictorial, the dangerous moments of sentimentality are skillfully avoided. For the connoisseur of film technique there are innumerable delicate touches. Willi Forst, whom you will probably remember from Bolvary's earlier pictures, was by no means ideal for the Italian, but his pleasing quality and his sense of the picturesque keep the part discreetly within the frame. And Trude von Molo brings all the beauty that was needed for the Mona Lisa's double.Money or Their Lives.An exceptional picture in its way, too, is the Ufa's last, \\"Bomben auf Monte Carlo\\" (The Bombardment of Monte Carlo), which has just had its première at the Ufa Palast—but not on account of the scenario. This is another one of those concoctions about bogus royalties on which the Ufa has been specializing. Here the Queen of one of those non-existent Balkan countries decides to give the insubordinate commander of her one and only battleship a sound lesson. So she disguises herself as a cocotte and vamps him in Monte Carlo. But he proves that beneath his rough exterior he has that heart of precious metal which has always been so beneficial to the box office. He buys her a necklace with money which he has wrung out of his native consulate at Monte Carlo and when he loses all the rest of it gambling he will not accept the pearls back from her. He asks the director of the casino for a small part of his money back, just enough to pay his sailors' back salaries, and when the official refuses he threatens to bombard Monte Carlo if he does not have the sum by 9 o'clock next morning. The Queen in her rôle as little gold digger spends the night on the ship with him. Next morning, when he is going to carry out his plan of bombardment, she discloses her identity and has him arrested in order to save him from the consequences of his rash act. The battleship gets under headway and he is freed, but the prospect of being a sort of queenly dependent does not appeal to his free spirit and he jumps overboard and swims to an outgoing steamer off for China. The Queen orders her battleship to follow him.But this cross-section of toffee is unimportant. The important thing is that the Ufa film under the supervision of Erich Pommer is a completely satisfying entertainment. First of all, there is Hans Albers as the captain. As I have had occasion to remark before, this player has strutted himself into the heart of German womanhood. And I feel sure that his warm brutality will be equally engaging to the femininity of our States. Anna Sten, the Russian actress who helped make the \\"Kaamazov\\" film one of the events of last year's season, is not so well suited to the rôle of the Queen, but then I understand that there are people who like to believe that a queen is really at bottom just like a little shop girl—\\"Judy O'Grady and the Colonel's lady,\\" you know. And in minor rôles we have the excellence of Heinz Rühmann, Ida Wüst, Karl Ettlinger and Otto Wallburg.Even over here where the critics have not ceased moaning about the decease of the silent film they had to admit that this picture was an artistic unit, had all the completeness of form of the silent at its best. They don't make pictures better anywhere in the world.In the Industry.Then there are several developments in the German industry which are of considerable interest. For one thing the Emelka Film Company has at last settled down to business. This firm, as I have had occasion to report several times before, has had a stormy past. Six years ago it was a serious rival to the Ufa, both as theatre owner and producer. But it came upon bad days three years ago and the German Government, then strongly socialistic, took over the majority stock because they were afraid the Emelka theatres would get into the hands of the Ufa. The Ufa, you know, is controlled by Hugenberg and a conservative group. But just at this time the light German bubble of prosperity burst and the government tried as quickly as possible to get out from under, to sell their holdings to anybody who would take them, whether foreigners or not. Finally a French group backed by Pathé-Nathan combined with some Germans, principally Munich bankers, took the Emelka over and the government retired with a very heavy loss. But this proved only an interregnum, as the French backers got into difficulties in the Oustric affair and the firm was as good as dead.Now at last it has been completely reorganized again and Max Schach, formerly connected with many important companies, has been added to the board of directors. Although there are still representatives of the French interests on the board Schach will undoubtedly have a large part in deciding the policy of the organization. His influence is already shown by the engagement of Karl Grune as artistic supervisor of Emelka productions. Under Schach's supervision Grune produced the most interesting film of his career, \\"Die Strasse\\" (The Street) and the title of his first Emelka production, \\"The Song of Work,\\" certainly sounds stimulating. Grune has already left for Munich and is bringing the Emelka studio up to date again technically. A new staff has already been engaged. We may look forward to the Emelka this Winter as an active producing unit.To Make Mute Films.And the latest news from Munich is that a company has been organized to produce a series of silent pictures. Under the direction of Stuart J. Lutz the first film will be called \\"The Youngest of the Regiment\\" and will appeal to the strongly nationalistic taste. The film will be made very cheaply in the long disused Bavaria studio and its largest field of distribution will be nationalistic organizations of various sorts. But it was interesting to hear that the silent film is not entirely dead and there are those who believe that it will always go on existing where cheap production and limited appeal are the deciding factors.And finally, the cheerful report comes that the Ufa is going to pay 5 or 6 per cent dividends on its stock after a pause of four years. This means that the Hugenberg era has been a success, that the Ufa is not only breaking even but is now a money making organization. There is now no denying that the talker is a success in Germany and that the German public does go enough to films to make the production of 100 per cent German language talkers an inviting business proposition. The German film industry today seems to have less need of American capitalization than ever before.\\"Top o' the Hill,\\" Charles Kenyon's play about the film star whose success becomes a boomerang, will be picturized by Paramount, with Claudette Colbert and William Boyd in the commanding rôles.\\"Mary Makes a Call,\\" a play by Homer Miles recently purchased by Paramount, is to go before the cameras soon under the title, \\"Wayward.\\" Miriam Hopkins and Phillips Holmes will be the leading players.

Miss Muratova, whose film opened the Walter Reade Theater's revealing current series called \\"A Dream, A Promise: Films of the Glasnost Era,\\" recently told an American audience that she considered her film essentially French in style, and that perhaps its esthetic daring was too extreme for Soviet censors. (Beautifully shot in black and white, \\"Long Farewells\\" has its own distinctively fluid style, along with strong echoes of the French New Wave.)
