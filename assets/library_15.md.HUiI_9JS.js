From this formal opening, the film plunges bravely into the ticklish subject of color consciousness among blacks.   What it finds is the prevalence of a subtle caste system in which those whose looks come closest to approximating white European standards of attractiveness tend to fare better in American society than those who look more African. It also finds that the tensions generated by this system, which is really an internalized expression of white racism, leave almost everybody feeling insecure. While those who are darker skinned are made to feel less desirable as mates and tend not to do as well economically, light-skinned blacks can find themselves accused of being pretenders to their African heritage.

The awkwardly titled RESISTANCE AND REBIRTH: HUNGARIAN CINEMA, 50 YEARS AFTER '56 actually encompasses separate but related points of interest: ''Remembering '56,'' which highlights work about the uprising and its aftermath, including Istvan Szabo's autobiographically informed 1966 film ''Father''","excerpt":"the self-explanatory ''Tribute to Miklos Jancso: The Currents of History''; and ''New Cinema From Hungary.''

More than 200 eager tourists pour out, stumbling at a half trot down from the road, through the deep sand toward the sea. The guide, a small man wearing jeans, running shoes and a jacket advertising Marlboro, is standing over the huge dark shape of a leatherback turtle. He waves the new arrivals over with his flashlight, a lighted cigarette dangling from his mouth.\\n\\nThe turtle is immobile, facing the sea, staring blearily ahead through gummy eyes from which run a constant stream of tears, a mechanism that helps to rid the animal of excess salt. This leatherback is medium sized, perhaps six feet long and weighing half a ton. As the morning light grows steadily stronger, details of the geometrical patterns on its dark, seaweed-green shell begin to emerge. The animal has a large pink scar disfiguring the skin of its surprisingly small head.

JOE WARD Team Pursuit: An Olympic Newcomer"},{"year":"1993","title":"Without \\"Show Boat,\\" there would have been no \\"Porgy and Bess,\\" no \\"Oklahoma!,\\" no \\"West Side Story.\\" Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's 1927 Broadway musical was the first to tell an adult story adapted from a sprawling novel (by Edna Ferber), the first to traffic in serious themes (miscegenation, marital collapse), the first to aspire to the epic size of classic 19th-century American literature. With its cracker-barrel humor, metaphorical use of the Mississippi River and poignant attempts to bridge the vast American racial divide, \\"Show Boat\\" is the Broadway musical's answer to \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\\" Or would be if Twain had had Florenz Ziegfeld's taste for soaring melodies and lavish spectacle.    In today's American theater, there may be no artist more indebted to \\"Show Boat\\" than Harold Prince, whose entire career, from the original production of \\"West Side Story\\" to the current \\"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\\" has been devoted to building on the serious musical that Kern and Hammerstein invented. So it is no surprise that Mr. Prince's staging of \\"Show Boat\\" here, as the opening attraction of the North York Performing Arts Center, is a seismic event in the American musical theater. Given a huge budget, an enormous cast in which Broadway stalwarts vastly outnumber local recruits, and a house that resembles the mammoth Gershwin Theater back home, Mr. Prince has approached the piece as if it were a new work that might have been submitted to him by Stephen Sondheim shortly after their collaboration on \\"Sweeney Todd.\\" The result is a continuously fascinating display of theatrical wizardry that, largely because of inadequate acting, still falls short of what must be its principal goal: to make \\"Show Boat\\" as powerful for contemporary audiences as it was for those of the late 1920's and 30's.

America's industrial sector is reeling from recession. As last week's report that the index of leading economic indicators rose 1.5 percent in March demonstrated, a recovery has begun, but its vigor and staying power are uncertain. There is pervasive slack - in steel, shipbuilding, aircraft production, mining, construction. Unemployment exceeds 10 percent and may be close to that level when the voters elect a President and new Congress 18 months from now. And yet the 98th Congress is refusing to give President Reagan all the money he seeks for national defense, money that presumably would help move the economy towards full employment.   How much defense money to put into the 1984 Congressional budget resolution will be a highly charged issue in Senate floor debate on the budget, which starts tomorrow. With the Republican majority divided on defense and on how much to raise taxes - a nine-Senator working party created last week to seek a consensus position on the floor had an inconclusive meeting Thursday -it is already plain that Mr. Reagan will have to settle for less than the $280.5 billion of military spending authority he requested.

Since 1976, Dr. Mills resided in Palgrave, Ontario, Canada. Born in St. Stephen, New Brunswick, Canada, Kenneth G. Mills attended Mount Allison University and pursued a successful career as a concert pianist, and for 25 years as a teacher and adjudicator. His lifelong quest for answers to the eternal questions of life revealed to him extraordinary innate abilities of speech and artistic expression. He will be remembered most for his 50,000 recorded hours of spontaneous philosophical lectures called Unfoldments, a vast selection of which can be found in his 13 books and over 30 CDs, and for founding and conducting the internationally acclaimed vocal ensemble, The Star-Scape Singers in 7 Carnegie Hall performances, 8 European tours and 17 recordings. Dr. Mills inspired those he met in countries around the world with his prose and poetry, landscape and floral paintings, haute couture designs, and recorded choral and orchestral compositions, including ''The Fire Mass'' and symphony ''Majestic Landscape.'' Special honours received by him include an Honorary Doctorate from Wolfe's University of King's College, Cambridge","excerpt":"The Senate of Canada Award of Excellence for outstanding achievement in the Humanities, Education, Philosophy and Arts; the MedArt USA Special Recognition Award ''for the outstanding healing power of his Art'' and as the 1997 Honorary PRIME Mentor of Canada ''for being an exemplary mentor and for serving as a role model par excellence whom society could look up to for inspiration and guidance.'' Dr. Mills was Founder of the philanthropic charitable organization Patrons of Wisdom which provided significant opportunities for young classical performers and cultural exchange since 1980. He also founded the Earthstage Actors whose dramatic performances based on his words have been called ''a modern-day Shakespeare.'' Dr. Mills is survived by his sister, Mrs. Eleanor Nickerson of St. Stephen, New Brunswick and Mr. David Kennet. He will be dearly missed by the thousands who had the honour and privilege of knowing him. At the request of the deceased, there will be no memorial service. To commemorate Dr. Mills' life, donations can be made to The Kenneth G. Mills Foundation, P.O.

If surprise is betrayed in this summation, it is at discovering such material and such a theme played with the freshness and authority that they have in this film.For this sort of hospital drama is wholly familiar to the screen, not to mention the radio air waves, out of which it has been run into the ground. There's the hospital staff with its problems—the lady surgeon who is torn between love and loyalty to her research-chemist husband and a tempting London job","excerpt":"the senior surgeon, a dignified stickler; his flabby, irresponsible son and the hard-driving nurse whom the latter is casually giving the air. There is also the capable director who deals with temperaments and hospital boards and there's the pretty, young, new probationer who still shudders at the sight of blood.In the department of patients, there's the little boy with an injured hand who develops a rare blood-poisoning that penicillin won't cure; there's the grouchy old farmer with stomach ulcers, the bandaged fellow with the badly burned face and the poor young woman with the cerebral abscess which the glib young doctor fails to diagnose. And, for comic relief, there's the fellow with a backache but no health card who keeps trying to cut through the red tape of Britain's socialized medicine plan.The ingredients, drawn from the novel, \\"Yeoman's Hospital,\\" by Screenwriters Pat Jackson and Jan Reed, are as average and un-amazing as what happens in a hospital every day. But the screen play is crisply written, it has been directed by Mr. Jackson with snap and sense and it is played with refreshing comprehension by one of those nicely tuned English casts.Googie Withers is becomingly literal as the lady doctor in low-heel shoes and James Donald is excellent as her husband who tests new serums in the hospital lab (and insists that the untried antitoxin for the rare blood-poisoning be used on himself). Godfrey Tearle, as the senior surgeon; Jack Watling, as his reckless son; Moira Lister, as the nurse whom he is jilting, and Barry Jones, as the director, are excellent, too. And, among the dominant patients, Brand Inglis, as the injured boy, and Basil Radford, as the fellow without a health card, are most affecting, at opposite extremes.To be sure, the sentiment is frankly flavored, the Hippocratic oath is generously implied and the practicality of the bio-chemist's research is a little psuedo, we would assume. But the documentary style of presentation (without music) is a strong antidote for the goo. If you like your drama with bandages and bed sores, \\"White Corridors\\" is what the doctor prescribes.

For this exhibition was the celebrated ''International Style'' show, in which the museum presented the stark, white buildings of stucco and glass and metal by Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe and others that it wanted us to think would pull us out of the stultifying classicism of the 19th century and pave the way to a glorious new world.

Some others, never the greatest, are merely obscure. It is in this second category, films that by their own confusions and inadequacies fail to make the kind of sense they so unclearly intend, that Edwin Sherin's \\"Glory Boy,\\" which opened yesterday at the Baronet and Forum theaters, belongs.\\"Glory Boy\\" is yet another movie made not about, but under the shadow of, the Vietnam War. When its young hero (Michael Moriarty) returns home to his father's run-down farm north of San Francisco, he brings with him a stupid but relatively harmless Army buddy (William Devane) and a Regular Army sergeant (Mitchell Ryan) who is more or less waiting put his 30 days before re-enlisting.The sergeant is no friend, merely somebody picked up because his stern jaw, his medals and his military manner will please the old man. But behind his tough exterior seethes a soul of sulfuric acid, and after he has humiliated dad, knocked unconscious a hitchhiking college girl (Topo Swope) so as to rape her, and dynamited the fish in the trout stream, it becomes fairly obvious that he is a one-man social, moral and ecological disaster.Between the father (Arthur Kennedy) and the sergeant there is a certain equivalence, for the old man has in gentler ways ruined everything he has touched (so you shouldn't miss the point, he keeps praising the farm as a Garden of Eden) and he too represents the militarism of an age—the age of World War II. The film recognizes that the two wars are not equal—the father is fallen from sentimental ideals","excerpt":"the sergeant is pure evil force—but symbolically and, at last, literally, the two cancel each other out.I think this is the most significant action in \\"Glory Boy,\\" though there are several others, and there is a whole household full of representative types—including the girl who, unaccountably, comes back to cook and clean and put flowers on the dining room table. But except for what fits together all too neatly, nothing seems to belong with anything else, and it all feels like watching a series of strung-together three-minute sketches. Sherin's direction stresses action in the middle distance not all that bad, but limiting and the multiplication of pregnant pauses — so that sometimes it looks as though the actors really are standing around wondering what to do next.Almost everybody figures out something reasonable in time—except for William Devane, who plays for a kind of instant insanity and ends up suggesting, say, Jerry Lewis as Macbeth. But the two principle kids, Michael Moriarty and Topo Swope, really are something special—appealing without courting appeal, sympathetic without the production of any unnecessary charm. Michael Moriarty particularly brings a rather intricate intelligence to an almost incomprehensible role. But both he and Miss Swope introduce a quality I should never have expected in this movie—a quality of articulate and active lucidity.

Brigitte Rouan's film \\"Overseas\\" brings a Jane Austen-like sensibility to the story of three sisters living in Algeria during the final years of French colonial rule. The movie's opening scenes, set in the late 1940's, present a romantic picture of French colonial life in the days before the nationalist uprising that eventually drove a million Europeans to leave the country. It is a vision that the director, who also co-wrote the film and who plays one of the sisters, spends the rest of the movie demolishing in a story that is subtly colored with Marxist and feminist overtones.

This is from \\"By Shaker Hands\\" by June Sprigg (University Press of New England, paper).   Twentieth-century simplicity is machine-made, out of man-made materials, and the result of a movement in design","excerpt":"the Shaker kind of simplicity was made by hand, of wood or wool or stone by Shaker craftsmen, and the result of a religious movement to create a simple and perfect way of life. Twentieth-century simplicity is more often than not the manufacturer's demand since it means a faster rate of production. But to the Shaker who took all the time he needed to make his work perfect, simplicity was a gift of the spirit. . . .   Nineteenth-century Shakers would probably feel a sharp sense of irony in the fact that we admire them for the things that mattered the least to them, their material goods. We imitate their chairs, while ignoring their charity; we reproduce their tables and oval boxes, and reject their celibacy. How much more the Shaker valued the simplicity and humility of his spirit than the chair he used or the box he made. Thriving on Gossip    Gossip is our communal voice, Hugh Kenner writes -- necessary but of dubious value when used by biographers to re-create a life. This is from \\"Historical Fictions,\\" a collection of essays and reviews (North Point).   When people give interviews they're telling stories. . . . If we could hear their voices we'd be hearing that very essential human phenomenon, gossip: the endless talk by which people assimilate one another's oddness. Gossip is oral, gossip is an unbounded sphere of speech, renewed without cease. It is never idle, also never objective; it unites those present in a sustaining fiction about someone absent. It thrives in villages, it thrives in all small communities, academic, cultural, professional, it thrives in neighborhoods, thrives wherever people subsist on each other's company, make do with each other's mysteries. . . . Contrariwise, print is a praying mantis, gossip the mate she eviscerates. From gossip the book-writer sucks a goo called information, to cement edifices of assertion with. The Invisible Artist    To understand African art, Chinua Achebe argues (using his own tribe in Nigeria as an example), one must grasp that its most important feature is not the the artist but rather art's function in society. This is from \\"Hopes and Impediments: Selected Essays\\" (Anchor/Doubleday, paper).    Part of my artistic and intellectual inheritance is derived from a cultural tradition in which it was possible for artists to create objects of art which were solid enough and yet make no attempt to claim, and sometimes even go to great lengths to deny, personal ownership of what they have created. . . .    Mbari    is an artistic \\"spectacular\\" demanded of the community by one or other of its primary divinities, usually the Earth goddess. To execute this \\"command performance\\" the community is represented by a small group of its members selected and secluded for months or even years for the sole purpose of erecting a befitting \\"home of images\\" filled to overflowing with sculptures and paintings in homage to the presiding god or goddess. These representatives . . . chosen to re-enact, as it were, the miracle of creation in its extravagant profusion, are always careful to disclaim all credit for making, which rightly belongs to gods; or even for initiating homage for what is made, which is the prerogative of the community. Remembrance of Meals Past    One feature all great chefs and gourmets have in common is their ability to recollect and reproduce the savory specifics of a dish. This is from James Beard's \\"Delights and Prejudices\\" (Collier/Macmillan, paper).   The ability to recall a taste sensation, which I think of as \\"taste memory,\\" is a God-given talent, akin to perfect pitch, which makes your life richer if you possess it. If you aren't born with it, you can never seem to acquire it. Great wine palates must depend on taste memory for the sureness of their judgment. . . . Cheese tasters, tea tasters, cognac tasters -- all must depend for a living on the keenness of their taste memories. Great gastronomes also have a highly developed sense memory, or they would not make such a ceremony of tasting and enjoying food. And naturally good chefs and cooks must depend upon memory when they season or when they are combining subtle flavors to create a new sauce or a new dish. The Gaze of Recognition    Jane Goodall's work with chimpanzees raises a question implicit in the study of animal behavior: Can we ever really understand how animals see the world? This is from \\"Through a Window: My Thirty Years With the Chimpanzees of Gombe\\" (Houghton Mifflin).   Often I have gazed into a chimpanzee's eyes and wondered what was going on behind them. I used to look into Flo's, she so old, so wise. What did she remember of her young days? David Greybeard had the most beautiful eyes of them all, large and lustrous, set wide apart. They somehow expressed his whole personality, his serene self-assurance, his inherent dignity -- and, from time to time, his utter determination to get his way. For a long time I never liked to look a chimpanzee straight in the eye -- I assumed that, as is the case with most primates, this would be interpreted as a threat or at least as a breach of good manners. Not so. As long as one looks with gentleness, without arrogance, a chimpanzee will understand, and may even return the look. And then -- or such is my fantasy -- it is as though the eyes are windows into the mind. Only the glass is opaque so that the mystery can never be fully revealed.

Shakespeare here is more of a summer tradition, with productions of ''As You Like It'' and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' occupying seemingly every park. But for those who don't want to wait, the Shakespeare Society, an organization that periodically holds discussions, mock trials and other events about the playwright (a bust of him, above), on Sunday presents a starry collection of some of the best actors in the city reading monologues, scenes and poetry from Shakespeare in celebration of his 442nd birthday. Among the highlights will be John Turturro's Richard III, Elizabeth Marvel's Cleopatra and Robert Sean Leonard and Philip Bosco reading a scene between Prince Hal and Falstaff. Avery Brooks, who has performed Othello at the Shakespeare Theater in Washington, will reprise that role opposite the Iago of -- intriguingly -- Denis O'Hare, whose charming accountant in ''Take Me Out'' won him a Tony Award. Also on the bill are Kathleen Chalfant (as Queen Elizabeth to Mr. Turturro's Richard III), Michael Cumpsty and Maria Tucci (as Richard II and the Queen) and Marcia Gay Harden, Amy Ryan and F. Murray Abraham (as Olivia, Viola and Malvolio from ''Twelfth Night'').

Anywhere else, an offering of annuals -- flowers that germinate, bloom, set seed and die in a single season -- would be unremarkable: in the average garden catalogue, you can hardly miss them, page upon page of stoplight-red salvias and sulfurous yellow marigolds. But White Flower Farm's stately catalogue has always devoted itself exclusively to the most refined perennials, bulbs and shrubs -- horticulture's aristocrats. Coming upon annuals in the pages of White Flower Farm is a little like finding Elmore Leonard in The New Yorker. Considering the influence the firm exerts on garden taste in this country, you have to wonder if perhaps a revolution is in the making.    For more than a hundred years, annuals have lived on the wrong side of the tracks in American gardening. Too gaudy in hue, too promiscuous in bloom and perhaps also too easy to grow, annuals have long been regarded as frivolous, low-rent flowers, the sort of thing planted by the sort of people who keep lawn ornaments in the front yard.

Survivors -- Dmitri Shostakovich, for one -- gain an aura just for showing up, for staying alive and in place even when history discourages them from doing so.

It was another composer, Beethoven, who threatened to take fate by the throat. The Shostakovich Fourth Symphony -- which Valery Gergiev conducted at the New York Philharmonic on Thursday night -- explains in hair-raising terms how fate returns the favor.

But on Monday, New Yorkers can see a major work by a master choreographer, interpreted by a distinguished ballet company: George Balanchine's 1967 triptych, ''Jewels,'' performed by the Paris Opera Ballet. There is no need to dress up","excerpt":"the show takes place on PBS Channel 13. Last performed by New York City Ballet in spring 2005 and unlikely to grace the New York State Theater for at least a few more seasons, ''Jewels'' has been danced by only 10 other companies. (The Dutch National Ballet is planning its first production in September, and the Royal Ballet is planning to present it in 2007.) The televised Paris Opera Ballet performance, at right, took place six years ago, with new costumes and set by Christian Lacroix and musical direction by Paul Connelly. This being Balanchine, the music is particularly important. ''Jewels'' is set to three composers: Fauré for the first section, ''Emeralds''; Stravinsky for ''Rubies''; and Tchaikovsky for the concluding ''Diamonds.'' Because of the origins (or, in Stravinsky's case, the adopted homeland) of the composers, as well as the choreographic differences between each part, the sections are viewed as taking their cues from French, American and Russian ballet styles. Balanchine was dismissive of such a reductive explanation, but it is still fascinating to watch a French company interpret the work. Those who want to study the performance further can buy the recently released Opus Arte DVD, with an added documentary section, ''George Balanchine Forever.'' Silly title aside, the documentary offers sensitive insights from the Paris company's creative staff, and especially the performers, all-important in an abstract ballet. The dancer Agnès Letestu says of Balanchine: ''Everything is in the body and what the dancer can do with the choreography. So it's up to the dancer in the end to perpetuate the technique and to make it live.''

As of early last week, the show had nearly $18 million in advance sales, the highest ever for a Broadway play. But what of theater-loving souls who do not have an American Express card or access to group sales? Don't they get a chance to buy a ticket?

The type of advance sale that ''The Odd Couple'' offered through American Express is increasingly popular among producers, guaranteeing money in the bank long before the reviews come in. It also cuts down on costs, reducing the need to advertise after the show opens.    So in the case of ''The Odd Couple,'' the only hope for many theatergoers may be another extension.

In fact, it is quite obvious that this photoplay gets out of hand only when the director abandoned the more subdued but none the less effective Rogers comedy for the Hollywood variety.Mr. Rogers furnished most of the titles for this film, and, that in itself, is a relief. As Brander he comes from Red Dog, Texas, \\"where men are men and the plumbing is improving,\\" to take up his work for his constituents in the House of Representatives. He is an advocate of \\"more wisdom and less wind\\" in Congress and he is credited with the assertion that since so many women have been serving States and the nation \\"politics has become downright effeminate.\\"In the course of this yarn. Mr. Rogers takes advantage of his skill with the lass???, much to the discomfort of hostile law-makers. The vamp who winks and purrs at Brander is impersonated by Lilyan Tashman.

C., and therefore one perceives Brander trudging up the Capitol steps, urged by Mrs. Brander to hurry \\"or those Republicans will grab all the front seats.\\"Mr. Rogers is a refreshing sight in a picture, for he not only succeeds in being comic, but he devotes a good deal of time to \\"acting naturally.\\" Louise Fazenda is capital as Brander's persistent wife.

In the store's new partnership with Ticketmaster, America's largest computerized ticket service, customers can now buy seats for certain Broadway and Off Broadway shows at the store for a discount beginning at 10 A.M. rather than waiting until the TKTS booths open at 3 P.M. The Nederlander Organization, which owns nine Broadway theaters, is participating, along with 13 Off Broadway shows that already use Ticketmaster. Nederlander is the only one of the three major Broadway theater owners involved in the Bloomingdale's program","excerpt":"the Shubert Organization and Jujamcyn Theaters do not use Ticketmaster.   With what Fred Rosen, the Ticketmaster chairman, calls flexible pricing, customers will be offered discounts ranging from 10 to 75 percent, depending on the kind of full-price sales a show is having on any given day. And this ticket counter is indoors.   \\"At Bloomingdale's you can use a credit card to buy tickets at discount,\\" Mr. Rosen says. \\"At TKTS, you have to use cash. And there's more flexibility. If a really hot show is having a slow week and wants to offer only a 10 percent discount, they can. Why not let the producer decide the value of the tickets every day? We're just trying to provide more opportunities to go to the theater. This is about serving the public.\\" It is also about good business. The service charge will vary from $2 to $4 a ticket, Mr. Rosen says.   The Theater Development Fund is outraged, even though the Nederlanders will also continue to use TKTS. In a statement, the fund's president, David D. Holbrook, calls the new counter at Bloomingdale's \\"a blatant attempt to undermine the mission and good work of Theater Development Fund.\\"   \\"The theater and the public at large have a stake in preserving the integrity of TKTS against splinter efforts such as this one to market discounted tickets for profit on a piecemeal basis,\\" he says.   Because the nonprofit Theater Development Fund supports many of its programs with the $2 service charge for each ticket sold at TKTS, those programs may now be in jeopardy. They include low-cost tickets for those who could not ordinarily afford them and the Theater Access Project, which has assisted nearly 90,000 handicapped people. In the 1990-91 season, the fund accounted for 22 percent of all Broadway admissions and 13 percent of gross revenues.   Henry Guettel, the executive director of Theater Development Fund, says, \\"This unilateral action by the Nederlander Organization constitutes a real threat to T.D.F.'s programs in support of the theater and the growth of its audiences.\\"   James Nederlander, the president of the company, responds: \\"It is not our intention to harm T.D.F. We're trying to make it easy for the customer by offering a flexible forum for discounting.\\" Drama Behind 'The Extra Man'    \\"The Extra Man,\\" a new play by Richard Greenberg, will begin performances at Manhattan Theater Club on April 28. The play, says Mr. Greenberg, who also wrote \\"Eastern Standard,\\" is about an editor at a small publishing house, quietly unhappy in her marriage, who is seduced by one friend into an affair with another friend. The play landed at Manhattan Theater Club after its tryout last fall at the South Coast Repertory Theater in Costa Mesa, Calif., only after much offstage drama between the playwright, the director, Michael Engler, and the star, Peter Frechette, all of whom contributed to making \\"Eastern Standard\\" a hit.   Although \\"The Extra Man\\" was well received in Costa Mesa, the playwright and the director had come to a crossroads. \\"We were getting too complacent with each other instead of pushing each other the way we used to,\\" Mr. Engler says. \\"Like a marriage, you have to reinvent a collaboration sometimes, say things you haven't said.\\"   While they were saying them, Mr. Greenberg's agent, Helen Merrill, called Mark Lamos, the artistic director of the Hartford Stage Company, first about the possibility of presenting the play there, then about Mr. Lamos's directing it himself. Then the phone calls stopped. \\"I'm not sure exactly what happened,\\" Mr. Lamos says. \\"I knew Lynne Meadow wanted it for Manhattan Theater Club. Richard and I had talked about what he needed in order to rethink the production. Next thing I know, I was sharing a cab with Lynne and she was doing it.\\"   Mr. Greenberg says: \\"Helen is a fan of having an interim production before a play comes to New York, for prudent, protective reasons. I know Mark wanted to do it, and for a while I leaned toward that, too. But a first production is a director's first draft. Michael and I were reinvigorated about going back and approaching it fresh.\\"   Which, they decided, meant recasting, even Mr. Frechette's role. Mr. Greenberg says all four actors in the cast were sent letters late last week breaking the news. \\"It was artistic selfishness to recast,\\" he says. \\"No one did anything wrong.\\" Victor Latino, Mr. Frechette's agent, says he was unaware of the decision and had no comment.   Mr. Greenberg is also busy with \\"Pal Joey,\\" the Rodgers and Hart musical, for which he has rewritten the book. Jujamcyn Theaters will present a reading directed by David Warren on Feb. 13 and 14 with Burke Moses and Judy Blazer. Singing the Bradys' Praises    The theater could use a few more promoters like Ron Delsener. The rock impresario, who has presented everyone from Simon and Garfunkel in Central Park to the Rolling Stones at Shea Stadium, is also the executive producer of \\"The Real Live Brady Bunch\\" at the Village Gate, in which scripts of the hit television show are presented as theater. Recent ads have quoted Mr. Delsener saying, \\"Absolutely the hippest, most hilarious show I've ever seen.\\" The other person quoted in the ad is one Paula Vasallo, who happens to be Mr. Delsener's secretary.   \\"I figure I have good taste, so I can tell people to go,\\" he says. \\"The 70's are very in right now. And I don't really care about critics. We did a survey and found that most of the people who come to the show are there through word of mouth. One review called it a bunch of drivel. So I used that in an ad that ran in college newspapers, and it sold. Kids love camp.\\" Mr. Delsener is betting they will love it in Los Angeles, too.

Confronted with predictions that another disaster like the 1986 Challenger calamity was all but inevitable before the end of the century, the panel decided that the nation's efforts at space exploration should be uncoupled from the shuttle as soon as possible.    The recommendation faces barriers, including concern over the hefty price of overhauling the space program. And if the plan goes forward, years might pass -- perhaps a decade or more -- before the $25 billion shuttle fleet could be superseded. Indeed, another shuttle, the Endeavour, is about to roll off the production line. Even so, leaders from Congress, industry and academia have strongly backed the panel's findings, suggesting the beginning of the end for one of the space age's most bittersweet dramas.

NASA does not have a particularly good track record of accomplishing big projects on a shoestring.

As for the narrative it is the same old theme which the Bolsheviks delight in presenting with prejudice. This time the noble angle is portrayed by Mongol trappers and the evil side by representatives of the White Army of 1918 and any prosperous persons, and, as one might presume, the Mongols are triumphant.There is, however, much that is compelling in this production in the early scenes, but in the closing episodes it becomes hysterical and absurd incidents occur, including a man, who, through injuries, is hardly able to move around, suddenly becoming a veritable Samson.Yesterday afternoon whenever anything ill befell the officers or soldiery of the White Army, or the Mongols met with success, there was a hearty round of applause, which happens here invariably during the screening of a Russian picture.M. Pudovkin has a remarkable eye for pictorial views and he also succeeds in eliciting marvelously expressive acting from those under his guidance. The glimpse of L. Dediseff's interpretation of a bearded district commander of the White Troops, of V. Inkizhinov's portrayal of a Mongol trapper, of A. Tchistiakov's performance as a rebel leader, make an indelible impression on the spectator. Their facial expressions and their gestures are extraordinarily lifelike.The climactic moment of the chronicle is somewhat reminiscent of Frankenstein's experience with his monster, except that in this case the Monster chances to be a Mongol who has been chosen by the White Army commander to rule the rebellious tribesmen. He is the trapper, who is supposed to be a descendant of the redoubtable Genghis Khan of old. Just when the elderly commander is patting himself on the back for his idea in picking the new ruler, the trapper, in some mysterious manner, becomes a tower of strength, hurling furniture and bric-a-brac about the house and doing it just at the psychological moment—when the rebels make a successful drive.The pith of the story lies in the idea of a dealer refusing to pay the just price for a silver fox skin. Much is made of this skin, its rich fur and the scarcity of the animal. This Pudovkin emphasizes most ably. The trapper is seen until the purchase of the skin as a good-natured stolid person, but thereafter he is sullen. He has reason to be, for he has been captured while wearing the rebel uniform and sent out to be shot. The White soldier who takes him out into the outlying hills to put a bullet through him is against such methods, but he obeys his commander. No sooner does the soldier return than he is ordered to go back to find his victim. who is said to be either dead or dying. It happens that a professor in looking over belongings of the trapper gleans information concerning the Mongol's ancestry.

Rouda, a Columbus, Ohio, realtor who last month was elected president of the National Association of Realtors, the country's largest trade organization of real estate professionals.   Mr. Rouda said that those regions where home sales are slumping, including the New York area, New England and Southern California, are distinquished from others by the torrid pace at which their housing rose in price in the 1980's. Where prices rose more gradually, he said, markets have remained robust. Among the healthiest states, he said, are Oregon, Washington, Oklahoma, Ohio and North Carolina.   Nor is it likely, Mr. Rouda said, that the real estate brokerage business is in for a deep, long-term decline. He predicted that the National Association, with 800,000 members this year, probably would shrink moderately to about 780,000 members next year.   Mr. Rouda, president of HER, Realtors, the largest brokerage in central Ohio, was elected to head the National Association for a one-year term running to November, 1991. Among his responsibilities will be to pitch the industry's point of view to Congress. He said his two top priorities are lobbying for a decrease in capital gains taxes on real estate and for the reinstatement of passive loss provisions for investors in rental housing, which were eliminated with the tax reform of 1986.

Klee was born in Bern in 1879 but took his father's German citizenship and moved to Munich to study art at the age of 19. Soon after the Nazis came to power in 1933, Klee -- under scrutiny because of his ''decadent'' art -- returned to Switzerland and took refuge in Bern. He applied for Swiss naturalization in 1939, about a year before his death, but never received it. ''This is a belated reconciliation,'' said the artist's 65-year-old grandson, Alexander Klee. The museum, above, has a permanent exhibition of Klee's work, with paintings as well as hand puppets he made for his son, Felix, from 1916 to 1925. It also has a music hall with 300 seats, a children's museum and room for workshops, and will be home to a summer academy for young artists.

Picassos for Sale      A former lover of Pablo Picasso is to sell 20 sketches by the artist at an auction in Paris later this month, the BBC reported. The selection of artwork is estimated to be worth up to $2.4 million. Genevieve Laporte, 79, had a secret two-year affair with Picasso, whom she first met as a student when she interviewed him for a school newspaper. ''He was a tender man, respectful, intelligent, timid,'' she said. ''Not at all the abominable snowman we're used to hearing about.'' Picasso sketched many pictures of Ms. Laporte, above, while on vacation in St. Tropez in 1951 at the height of the couple's affair, when she was 24. Many sketches bear the inscription ''For Genevieve.'' Picasso asked her to move in with him two years later, shortly after his girlfriend, Francoise Gilot, left him, but Ms. Laporte refused. She married a former member of the French Resistance in 1959 and became an award-winning poet and documentary filmmaker.

MILES DAVIS From the band that made the album ''Live/Evil'' -- Davis playing trumpet through a wah-wah pedal, Gary Bartz on saxophones, Keith Jarrett on electric keyboards, John McLaughlin on electric guitar, Michael Henderson on electric bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums and Airto Moreira on percussion -- here now is five hours of unreleased music from that time, dark and funky and full-speed-ahead. ''The Cellar Door Sessions 1970'' is a six-disc box set, with essays looking back on that time by every living musician in the group. Sept. 27. Sony Legacy.    BRAD MEHLDAU The lyrical and adventurous jazz pianist has been changing his routine over the past few years with solo recitals and collaborations; on ''Day Is Done'' he gets back to the trio format, which made his name 10 years ago. Sept. 27. Nonesuch.    THELONIOUS MONK QUARTET WITH JOHN COLTRANE One of the great finds of jazz archaeology in the past year was this 1957 performance by a first-tier, short-lived and little-recorded band. It has been turned into an album, ''Live at Carnegie Hall,'' that transcends jazz-scholar interests; it's great music. Sept. 27. Blue Note.    JELLY ROLL MORTON The greatest bragger in jazz, and its first genius composer, Morton gave rambling, talking, singing, myth-building performances in front of Alan Lomax's microphone at the Library of Congress in 1938, and they now get their full due. ''The Complete Library of Congress Recordings by Alan Lomax'' contains eight CD's, presenting the sessions in their complete original running order. Sept. 27. Rounder.    SEAN PAUL The producers of the Jamaican reggae-dancehall-hip-hop star's fizzy third album, ''The Trinity,'' include the dancehall kingpin Lenky Marsden. Sept. 27. VP/Atlantic.    'PROGRESSIONS: 100 YEARS OF JAZZ GUITAR' From Vess Ossman in 1906 -- on banjo, actually -- to Bill Frisell, and stopping along the way at Charlie Christian, Django Reinhardt, Pat Metheny and Sonny Sharrock, this four-disc set astutely gathers the evidence of the guitar's importance to jazz -- and, importantly, from many different labels. Sept. 27. Sony Legacy.    JENNY SCHEINMAN Ms. Scheinman is a violinist who has been working out her own marvelous path through jazz from the 1920's and the 1960's and possibly the future -- as well as calypso, French musette, Brazilian choro and about 10 other genres. In doing so, she has made remarkably cohesive albums; ''12 Songs,'' with a septet including Bill Frisell on guitar, is her best so far. Sept. 27. Cryptogramophone.    SOULFLY The latest slab of rage and tribalism from the metal band led by the Brazilian-American musician Max Cavalera is ''Dark Ages.'' Sept. 27. Roadrunner.    GRETCHEN WILSON Sly and just real enough, Ms. Wilson blew minds last year with her first album; her second, ''All Jacked Up,'' includes a duet with Merle Haggard called ''Politically Uncorrect,'' and a version of Billie Holiday's ''Good Morning Heartache.'' Sept. 27. Sony Nashville. A related article is on Page 77.    NEIL YOUNG A countryish album of new music by Mr. Young with a backup band including the steel guitarist Ben Keith and the keyboardist Spooner Oldham; the CD release will include an extra DVD showing the making of the album. Sept. 27. Reprise.    'JAZZ CON SALSA' Jazz at Lincoln Center's Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, led by the pianist Arturo O'Farrill, has started out strong in its first couple of years. The list of rather progressive-minded guest soloists -- Greg Osby, Joe Lovano and Lew Soloff -- tells you that this isn't an ordinary Latin-jazz repertory orchestra; then again, is there any other Latin-jazz repertory orchestra? Sept. 30 and Oct. 1. Rose Theater.    JUELZ SANTANA The youngest member of the Harlem-based crew called the Diplomats (or Dipset), led by the rapper Cam'ron, Juelz Santana has been a straight-shooting favorite on mixtapes for a few years; his second album is ''What the Game's Been Missing.'' September. Def Jam.    October    ACROSS THE NARROWS FESTIVAL A heavyweight alternative-rock festival unlike any we've ever seen here -- actually two days of it, with concerts going on simultaneously in two different boroughs. The first day presents the Pixies, Gang of Four, Built to Spill and Rilo Kiley, among others, at Keyspan Park in Coney Island. At Richmond County Bank Ballpark on Staten Island, the bill includes the Killers, Interpol, the New York Dolls and Tegan and Sara. On the second day: Beck and Belle and Sebastian in Brooklyn, and Oasis and Jet in Staten Island. (Details at www.acrossthenarrows.com.) Oct. 1 and 2.    FIONA APPLE The upshot of the controversy over last year's Internet-leaked tracks and an album that seemed to be stalled or censored or at least unfairly treated by her record company was this: a new producer, a (mostly) new batch of songs, and a finely whetted public appetite for any kind of Fiona Apple record, never mind that ''Extraordinary Machine'' seems to be a good one. Oct. 4. Epic.    FRANZ FERDINAND ''You Could Have It So Much Better With Franz Ferdinand'' is the second album by the miraculously successful Scottish postpunk band, which has said it aimed only to make music girls could dance to. Oct. 4. Domino/Epic.    MUGISON ''Mugimama, Is This Monkey Music?'' Get ready for another Icelandic singer-songwriter; he's trippy and melancholic and close-miked, singing as if he's confiding in you. Oct. 4. Ipecac.    SINEAD O'CONNOR Ms. O'Connor has made ''Throw Down Your Arms,'' a full-length album of roots-reggae protest songs, including Winston Rodney's ''Door Peep,'' Lee Perry's ''Curly Locks'' and Peter Tosh's ''Downpressor Man.'' (Bob Marley's ''War,'' which she famously performed on ''Saturday Night Live'' in 1992 before ripping up a photo of Pope John Paul II, is the last track.) Production and rhythm-section playing are by the irreproachable Sly and Robbie, and Ms. O'Connor's voice is as strong and clear as ever. Oct. 4. Sanctuary.    LIZ PHAIR ''Somebody's Miracle'' continues the second phase of Ms. Phair's career, in which an indie-rock heroine comes to grips with commercial pop aesthetics. Oct. 4. Capitol.    MARIZA One of the most exciting young Portuguese fado singers, in the tradition of Amalia Rodrigues, performs at Carnegie Hall for the first time. Oct. 7.    NICKEL CREEK A neo-bluegrass band, incorporating rock songcraft, that gets better all the time. Oct. 7. Nokia Theater.    ROSCOE MITCHELL QUARTET WITH MUHAL RICHARD ABRAMS The saxophonist has been one of jazz's greatest conceptualists for four decades; in this special performance, along with his regular band, he collaborates with Mr. Abrams, the pianist who was a founder of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (A.A.C.M.) The concert is part of ''Ancient to the Future,'' a series this fall and winter presented by Ars Nova Workshop and International House, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the A.A.C.M. Oct. 8. International House, Philadelphia.    GANG OF FOUR ''Return the Gift.'' After the true excitement of their reunion shows this year, here is a more dubious proposition: a disc of old Gang of Four tracks, newly rerecorded by the band, and a second disc of Gang of Four songs remixed by the likes of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Ladytron and Tony Kanal of No Doubt. Oct. 10. V2 Records.    JOHN COLTRANE QUARTET It's been circulated a little bit as a bootleg over the years, but only in parts, and with inferior sound. If you're into John Coltrane just as his music was sliding from the highly organized ''Love Supreme'' into free jazz, you won't be disappointed by ''One Down, One Up: Live at the Half Note,'' which contains about 80 minutes of Coltrane's quartet in its prime. Oct. 11. Impulse.    JAMIE CULLUM The long-rumored collaboration between the young British jazz singer and the hip-hop producer Pharrell appears not to be on the album, because of legal issues, but ''Catching Tales'' is otherwise a sound follow-up to ''Twentysomething,'' Mr. Cullum's breakthrough, with a mix of standards, rock covers (the Doves' ''Catch the Sun'') and jokey originals. Oct. 11. Verve.    DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL Chris Carrabba, who leads the band Dashboard Confessional and has become a sensitive emo prince over the last decade, is in now the neighborhood of 30. But perhaps you can't ever exhaust the topic of tortured teenage love. On the other hand, his next album is produced by Daniel Lanois, who tends to work with artists who have reached a new level of maturity. Oct. 11. Vagrant.    DEERHOOF A miraculous, obdurate little rock band; by turns spastic and controlled, they turn themselves inside out on each record. ''The Runners Four'' is, yet again, the band's best work. Oct. 11. 5 Rue Christine/Kill Rock Stars.    'DIFFERENT STROKES BY DIFFERENT FOLKS' A tribute album in honor of Sly and the Family Stone, including tracks by Maroon 5, the Roots, Big Boi, Janet Jackson and others; it has actually been approved by the super-reclusive Mr. Stone himself. Oct. 11. Sony Legacy.    EARLY MAN Early Man is two guys from Columbus, Ohio, who both wound up in New York, and two years ago decided to start playing as a metal duo. The first album, ''Closing In,'' is a little thin, but not a joke; they're juiced on early Metallica as if they've just discovered it. Oct. 11. Matador.    SHIRLEY HORN ''But Beautiful: The Best of Shirley Horn on Verve.'' Ms. Horn's body of work for Verve since 1988 is not many small things but one big thing: slow-moving, mentholated, a little sad, strangely lingering in the memory. The album will include three tracks from her last New York engagement, last fall at Le Jazz Au Bar. Oct. 11. Verve.    ALICIA KEYS The soul singer-songwriter has done her MTV ''Unplugged'' session, a format well suited to her; it will be broadcast this month, and here's the resulting album. Oct 11. J Records.    RICKY MARTIN ''Life'' is his first new English-language album in five years, with guests including Fat Joe and Amerie. Oct. 11. Columbia.    DOLLY PARTON From a country singer who never stops fighting her way to new audiences comes ''Those Were the Days'' -- a collection of folk and pop songs from the 1960's and 1970's, written by the likes of John Lennon (''Imagine'') and Tommy James (''Crimson and Clover''). Oct. 11. Sugar Hill.    MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE The justly celebrated bosses of emo-punk have hit the big circuit. Oct. 13, the Theater at Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J.    DUNGEN The psychedelic Swedish band -- which on records is one man, Gustav Ejstes -- returns to New York for another round of touring; Dungen's last album, ''Ta Det Lugnt,'' released last year in Europe and more recently here, is slowly acquiring a deep American fan base. Oct. 15. Bowery Ballroom.    ANIMAL COLLECTIVE Thicker, louder and more electric than ''Sung Tongs,'' its breakthrough album from last year, Animal Collective's new album, ''Feels,'' nevertheless continues the general idea of giddy folk-rock stomps and chants and powwows. The album (like the band) is definition-proof, but at its best this sounds like rehearsed, collective stream-of-consciousness. Oct. 18. Fat Cat.    NELLIE McKAY ''Pretty Little Head'' is the new album from this extravagantly witty songwriter, who is like a more confrontational Cole Porter; it includes duets with Cyndi Lauper and K.D. Lang. Oct. 18. Columbia.    MARTY STUART From the most deep-thinking and history-minded of commercial country singers, ''Badlands'' is a whole album about the culture of Native Americans in South Dakota. Oct. 18. Superlatone/Universal South.    FRED HERSCH A 50th-birthday concert from the ambitious, concept-generating jazz pianist. It will be entirely solo piano, which may be what he does best. Oct. 19. Zankel Hall.    GANGBE BRASS BAND From Benin, an extraordinary band that can suggest New Orleans parade music one minute and Afrobeat the next. Oct. 22. Zankel Hall.    YOUSSOU N'DOUR The great Senegalese singer, who puts on some of the deepest, most joyous concerts in popular music. Oct. 23 to 26. Zankel Hall.    VASHTI BUNYAN The folk singer Vashti Bunyan's first album, ''Just Another Diamond Day,'' came out in 1969; 30 years later, it helped spawn a new eccentric folk movement, spearheaded by Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom. Both make appearances on Ms. Bunyan's at-long-last follow-up, ''Lookaftering.'' Oct. 25. DiCristina.    FIERY FURNACES A truly weird album of memory and family history, ''Rehearsing My Choir'' is a collaboration between Eleanor Friedberger and her brother Matthew of the Fiery Furnaces and their grandmother, Olga Sarantos. Ms. Sarantos talks and sings as herself in the present tense, and Ms. Friedberger recounts passages as her grandmother in the 1940's. Oct. 26. Rough Trade.    WILLEM BREUKER KOLLEKTIEF A long-running (and state-supported!) troupe of Dutch jazz musicians who use bits of Latin music, circus routines and free jazz in original combinations. Oct. 27. Merkin Concert Hall.    GANESH AND KUMARESH WITH ZAKIR HUSSAIN The brothers Ganesh and Kumaresh are accomplished violinists and singers in South Indian music; Zakir Hussain is a tabla virtuoso. Oct. 28. Peter Norton Symphony Space.    'TAPPIN' INTO MONK' The tap-dancer Savion Glover has gotten deep inside jazz before, most recently with John Coltrane's music; here he'll be getting into Thelonious Monk, whose rhythmic songs ought to be a hundred times easier to dance to than Coltrane's music. Oct. 28 and 29, Rose Theater, with an Oct. 29 Jazz for Young People matinee.    MI AND L'AU Mi, a Finnish singer, met L'Au, a French musician and producer. They fell in love and moved to a cabin in Finland to make art together in isolation. Their first album, self-titled, twinkles with acoustic stringed instruments; it's folkish, but more traditionally pretty and serene than, say, Devendra Banhart. Oct. 31. Young God.    MATISYAHU A Caribbean hip-hop album, produced by Bill Laswell, from a real cultural oddball: a young Hasidic rapper from Brooklyn who went through his teen-hippie phase and moved on. October. Or Music/Epic.    TEGO CALDERÓN The first reggaetón artist to sign with a major non-Latin label, Mr. Calderón is one of the performers with the most worldwide potential over the next few years. ''The Underdog/El Subestimado,'' his first album for a major label, will still be mostly in Spanish. October. Atlantic. A related article is on Page 77.    November    ALTAMONT A band led by Dale Crover, drummer of the Seattle proto-grunge band the Melvins, with some similarity to Queens of the Stone Age; its first album, ''The Monkees' Uncle,'' is unpretentiously odd, sludgy and pounding in some parts, briskly pop-ified in others. Nov. 1. AntAcid Audio.    BOBBY BARE As the composer of hits including ''Detroit City'' and ''How I Got to Memphis,'' Mr. Bare is an intriguing presence in 70's country, sort of a junior member of Waylon and Willie's Outlaws posse. He hasn't made an album in 22 years, but his son, Bobby Bare Jr., a smart, eccentric force in alternative country, produced ''The Moon Was Blue,'' the elder Bare's return to form. Nov. 1. Dualtone.    DIANA KRALL A Christmas album from contemporary jazz's million-seller, ''Count Your Blessings.'' Nov. 1. Verve.    SANTANA Continuing the guest-laden album formula that moved him back into mass consciousness, Carlos Santana's new album, ''All That I Am,'' reportedly rounds up cameos from Big Boi, Mary J. Blige and Los Lonely Boys. Nov. 1. J Records.    TIN HAT/MARK ORTON'S AURORA SEPTET The delicate acoustic trio (and now quartet) Tin Hat has cut across extremely wide swaths of music: jazz, classical, tango, French popular song, blues, experimental improvisation. It shares a bill with a septet led by Mr. Orton, Tin Hat's guitarist. Nov. 3. Merkin Concert Hall.    MAHRAJAN AL-FAN FESTIVAL OF ARAB ARTS A three-day festival, directed by the oud player Simon Shaheen, featuring some of the prime movers of traditional Arab arts. Nov. 4, Graduate Center at CUNY. Nov. 5 and 6, Peter Norton Symphony Space.    PATTI LARKIN/KAKI KING As part of ''La Guitara,'' a series featuring female guitarists, the Celtic-funk-folk musician Patti Larkin is on a double bill with the younger Kaki King, a virtuosic acoustic guitarist. Nov. 6. Merkin Concert Hall.    KENNY CHESNEY An expert chronicler of how to spend your off-time -- his last album was largely devoted to beach-bumming in the Caribbean -- the enormously successful country singer's new album is ''The Road & the Radio.'' Nov. 8. BNA/BMG.    NEIL DIAMOND The old heartthrob has a new album produced by Rick Rubin, who tends to bring out the best in performers -- though usually bands who play with a lot more volume and cussing, and generally darker vibes, than Mr. Diamond. Nov. 8. Columbia.    ROD STEWART Say what you will, but this guy, in his unpretentious way, keeps having the last laugh. ''The Great American Songbook, Vol. IV'' is likely to start another round of married make-out sessions. Nov. 8. J Records.    'BILLIE & ME' A cross-genre grouping of singers pay tribute to Billie Holiday in their own ways, including Dianne Reeves, Rokia Traoré and Fontella Bass. Nov. 10. Zankel Hall.    BIG & RICH A second album, called ''Comin' to Your City,'' by the duo that's helping to reshape country music, knocking through long-stratified conventions with a little bit of rap and metal and gospel. Nov. 15. Warner Brothers.    COUNTRY MUSIC ASSOCIATION AWARDS The big televised event of country music moves from Nashville to New York City (of all places) this year. Nov 15. Madison Square Garden. A related article is on Page 77.    MADONNA Her next album, ''Confessions on a Dance Floor,'' is reported to be nonpreachy and basically nonconceptual: just dance music as she used to make it. Nov. 15. Maverick.    SHAKIRA ''Oral Fixation, Vol. 2.'' From an intriguing Colombian pop star, a collection of entirely new songs, produced by Rick Rubin, and this time all in English, unlike the recently released ''Fijación Oral, Vol. 1.'' Nov. 15. Epic. A related article is on Page 77.    'WYNTON WITH STRINGS' The trumpeter and artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center presents his own quartet with a string section, conducted by Robert Sadin; they will play music from Mr. Marsalis's albums ''Hot House Flowers'' and ''The Midnight Blues.'' Nov. 17 to 19, Rose Theater.    SYSTEM OF A DOWN ''Hypnotize'' is Part 2 of a two-disc set, following last spring's ''Mesmerize.'' It's not that the two albums by the politicized, eccentric Armenian-American metal band are substantially different. Rather, the band rightly presumed that nobody could absorb so much manic anger in one go. Nov. 22. American/Columbia.    THE METERS A few months ago, in New Orleans, the four original members of the great funk band played together for the first time in years; it was advertised as their last show. Guess what? Nov. 25. Nokia Theater.    December    WADADA LEO SMITH'S GOLDEN QUARTET Known as a great lyrical and textural improviser since the late 60's, the trumpeter has had a midlife resurgence lately with his Golden Quartet, a band that shuffles around members but keeps its standards high. Dec. 3. International House, Philadelphia.    SONGS OF THE SEPHARDIC WORLD Yasmin Levy, an Israeli singer in her late 20's, presents Sephardic Jewish music of the 15th century from Andalusia, Morocco and Turkey. Presented by the World Music Institute and Carnegie Hall. Dec. 3. Zankel Hall.    STEFON HARRIS The jazz vibraphonist throws down equally hard in straight-ahead music or the funk setting of his new band, Blackout. Dec. 8. Leonard Nimoy Thalia, Symphony Space.    'WITHOUT GROUND' The young Ukrainian singer Mariana Sadovska, one of the more thrilling and intense singers in any style, has collaborated with the video artist Lars Jan on a song cycle about village life in Ukraine, using the folk songs she has learned from women in remote rural areas. Dec. 9. Leonard Nimoy Thalia, Symphony Space.    BUBBA SPARXXX ''The Charm'' will be the Southern rapper's third album; last time around (on ''Deliverance,'' an excellent and underappreciated album casting Southern white rural culture in hip-hop terms) he was helped by Timbaland, and this time he's on a new label run by Big Boi of OutKast. Purple Ribbon/Virgin. December.    2006    ROY HARGROVE AND MULGREW MILLER A duet between a trumpeter and pianist who have helped define the serious mainstream of American jazz over the last two decades. Jan 9. Merkin Concert Hall.    'THE MUSIC OF MISSISSIPPI JOHN HURT' The first of four Wednesdays given over to the blues in the New York Guitar Festival, this concert pays tribute to the serene blues fingerpicker with performances by Jorma Kaukonen, Bill Morrissey, Jen Chapin and Brandon Ross. Jan. 18. Merkin Concert Hall.    THE STROKES The third album by the New York post-punk band that for a minute seemed to have everyone in its corner. Jan. 24. RCA.    'BAJO! -- THE GREAT TRADITION OF THE LATIN BASS' The Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra of Jazz at Lincoln Center, featuring four great bassists: Israel Cachao Lopez, Andy Gonzalez, John Benitez and Charnett Moffett. Jan. 27 and 28. Rose Theater.    'LEGENDS OF JAZZ' Thirteen weekly episodes of a jazz show, hosted by the pianist Ramsey Lewis, with different musician guests on each program -- something that's been a long time coming on public television. January. PBS.    'CITY OF BROTHERLY JAZZ' A Philadelphia-themed Jazz at Lincoln Center show, featuring Tootie and Jimmy Heath, Pat Martino, Joey DeFrancesco and Duane Eubanks. March 10 and 11. Rose Theater.    GREAT AMERICAN SONGWRITERS WITH BILL CHARLAP In which the jazz pianist Mr. Charlap, with the singer Ethel Ennis and the tenor saxophonist Houston Person, works over the Vernon Duke songbook -- including ''Autumn in New York'' and ''April in Paris,'' two of the best songs ever written. March 16 to 18. Allen Room,.    'AS OF NOW: BARRY HARRIS AND REGINA CARTER' The pianist and the violinist take part in Jazz at Lincoln Center's continuing series of concerts featuring new commissioned work. April 7 and 8. Rose Theater.    'JAZZ IN MOTION: BALLET HISPANICO' Ballet Hispanico dancing to music by the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, including works by Tito Puente, Chico O'Farrill and Lalo Schifrin. April 21 and 22. Rose Theater.    'CONGO SQUARE' Inevitably, a Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra concert about the history of New Orleans music, dealing with the music of Sam Morgan, Jelly Roll Morton and others; there will also be a new composition by Wynton Marsalis, featuring the Ghanaian drummer Yacub Addy. May 4 to 6. Rose Hall.    PAUL BLEY AND FRANK KIMBROUGH Part of ''No Minimum,'' a Merkin series pairing jazz pianists. Mr. Kimbrough gets a lot of his quiet rhapsody from Mr. Bley, his elder, and there may be a bit of productive drama in his first face-to-face encounter with his greatest influence. May 22. Merkin Concert Hall.

Brass bands, Mardi Gras Indians, social aid and pleasure clubs, piano ticklers, jazz trumpeters, funk bands, rhythm-and-blues singers -- they're all part of the New Orleans documentary DVD ''Make It Funky!'' (Sony Pictures). Wrapped around an all-star 2004 concert are quick history lessons and reminiscences of racism, exploitation and triumphant musical fusions. Made when it seemed like the party in New Orleans would go on forever, the documentary now makes a new point: how the genius of the city's music was not only in its professionals but also in its street parties and neighborhoods, in communities that have since been ravaged and scattered.    Cabas       Add another name -- Cabas -- to the list of smart, border-hopping Colombian rockers that includes Shakira and Juanes. ''Cadena de Oro'' (''Chain of Gold''), the first single from Andres Cabas's third album, ''Puro Cabas'' (EMI Music U.S. Latin), chides a woman who traded her roots and her joy for wealth. Meanwhile, the music merges roots and flash: rock guitars and programmed percussion give way to clarinets, a trombone and a Colombian cumbia beat. It's just one of a dozen blithely catchy hybrids on an album that keeps coming up with ingenious pan-American pop.    Matt Pond PA       If you're going to be hypersensitive, keep it peppy. That's the strategy of Matt Pond PA, a band that recently moved from Philadelphia to Brooklyn. Mr. Pond, its songwriter, is full of self-doubt: ''I told myself not to remind me of the things I could have been,'' he sings in his frayed voice. But the band's new album, ''Several Arrows Later'' (Altitude), wraps his misgivings in folk-rock (complete with cello) that moves right along. In songs like ''From Debris'' and ''Several Arrows Later,'' clockwork guitar patterns and briskly insistent drumming -- closer to New Order and the Feelies than to Jackson Browne -- keep Matt Pond PA from becoming bogged down in self-pity.    Lura       The best-known music from the Cape Verde islands, off Senegal, is morna, the rueful ballads that have been carried worldwide by Cesaria Evora. Lura, a Portuguese singer from a Cape Verdean family, can sing morna with tender ardor. But the discoveries on her studio album ''Di Korpo Ku Alma'' (Escondida), which is packaged with a 45-minute concert DVD, are the up-tempo songs based on a rhythm called batuku. It's a six-beat syncopation originally slapped by women on folded stacks of clothes, and in a modern studio arrangement with pinpoint guitars, a song like ''Vazulina'' can be dizzying.    Dwele       Dwele got started singing hooks for rappers, but on his second album ''Some Kinda '' (Virgin), he usually avoids booming beats and sound-bite-sized tunes. The album is a musician's abstruse reverie, with thick jazz harmonies, vocals that ripple like recitative and layers of prismatic, disorienting rhythm that defy toe tapping. While Dwele sings about romance, what's really on his mind for the first half of the album is how many tangential horn lines and backup vocals he can cantilever above an elusive beat. Then he settles down and delivers a single -- ''I Think I Love U'' -- before returning to his fascinating, skillfully induced daze. ''Music in a lot of ways mimics relationships,'' he sings. ''It gets tainted when you bring rules into it.''    'Imaginational Anthem'       Indie rockers and jam bands have rediscovered the idiosyncratic finger-style guitarists, like John Fahey and Sandy Bull, who emerged in the 1960's. The producers of ''Imaginational Anthem'' (Near Mint) tracked down some of the surviving ones -- Suni McGrath, Steve Mann, Max Ochs, Janet Smith -- and recorded them anew, setting their pieces alongside rare older tracks and solos from latter-day virtuosos. Old and new, the music meditates on blues, Appalachian music, raga and ragtime, and traditions are transfigured by a deep love for the sonority of the acoustic guitar.    'I Believe to My Soul'       The producer Joe Henry has found a calling: saving great soul singers from the oldies circuit. He did it with albums by Solomon Burke and Bettye Lavette, and now with the luminaries on ''I Believe to My Soul'' (Work Song/Rhino/Hear Music): Mavis Staples, Ann Peebles, Irma Thomas, Billy Preston and the New Orleans master Allen Toussaint, who also led the band and wrote three new songs. The backup moves from gospel to country soul to funk","excerpt":"the singing is authoritative, and in songs like ''Both Ways'' (Mr. Preston), ''When the Candle Burns Low'' (Ms. Peebles) and ''Keep On Pushing'' (Ms. Staples), body and spirit are indivisible.    Alicia Keys       ''Unbreakable,'' the lone new song written by Alicia Keys (with Kanye West) on her live album, ''Unplugged'' (J), doesn't aim for timelessness; it's as full of topical references as a hip-hop song. Pretending she's not a celebrity herself, she compares an up-and-down romance to those of celebrity couples like ''Will and Jada'' or ''Oprah and Stedman.'' She sings, ''We got to live out our dreams like the people on TV,'' and insists that ''we'll be back next week,'' even despite ''technical difficulties.'' Her partner is lucky: she's not watching reality shows.

This week I have also walked in those paths, sampling a few of the many performances this work ritually receives every December, marveling again at the unearthly simplicity of \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery,\\" the tenderness of \\"He was despised and rejected,\\" and the robust vigor of Handel's conception of God and man. This oratorio has an uncanny ability to survive almost any performance, shedding glory on the players even if they do not always return the favor, allowing itself to be freely molded in the image of the musical worshiper.   Those images once included gargantuan performances like the one in London with 3,500 choristers that George Bernard Shaw wrote about in 1891. That tradition, a reflection of the British empire at the height of its power, is much more modestly preserved in the New York performances of the Oratorio Society or the Masterwork Chorus, but Handel today is generally far less grandiose and less awesome. There is a presumption of familiarity in the performances. The forces are usually smaller, informed by the authenticity movement","excerpt":"the singing is less stentorian and less connected to operatic styles.

But much of Montreal's night life takes place on Boulevard St. Laurent. The Godin (with 136 rooms) is one of the first hotels in this hip district, and it aims to be part of the scene. The hotel's slogan, printed on practically everything, is: ''There's the day, and then there's the night.'' This is a hotel of the night.    THE LOCATION -- Where St. Laurent intersects Sherbrooke, one of Montreal's main thoroughfares. Sadly, there's a large Esso station across the street from the hotel. Ask for a room facing away from the pumps. It's just a short walk to Boulevard Ste. Catherine, a seedy strip with aggressive panhandlers and plenty of sex shops but also lots of atmosphere. Imagine the East Village before gentrification.    THE BUILDING -- The hotel incorporates a 1914 structure that was gutted and linked to a new building with interiors by Yabu Pushelberg, the trendy Toronto design firm responsible for the W Times Square in New York. The canopy (with fake greenery growing upside down) and the lobby (with dark wood, wicker and woven stainless steel) put the Godin squarely in the category of chic boutique hotel.    AMENITIES -- The hotel's main draw is its glamorous bar, two floors below the lobby (but, thanks to a hilly site, overlooking St. Laurent). A ground-floor restaurant was supposed to open in July, but is still an empty shell. But that's O.K., because the hotel's owners operate two restaurants around the corner. One of them is named Globe, a nod to its fusion cuisine. Dinner costs about 60 Canadian dollars a person ($50 U.S. at $1.20 Canadian to the U.S. dollar). Trout with crayfish and chives was well prepared, as was truffle risotto, and the pear sorbet was a triumph. If you skip dessert, you'll find free coffee, delicious Mighty Leaf teas and cookies in the hotel lobby.    THE ROOM -- Gutsy. The ceiling is raw concrete. The walls are painted dark grays and dark browns. Furniture is almost black, and floors are charcoal-colored stone and carpet. But lots of lights and a wall-size mirror keep the room from feeling gloomy. Despite the action on the street and in the bar below, no noise intrudes. The TV is part of an in-room computer system. That's not entirely good news. When I wanted to turn on the TV, I couldn't. I wasted 20 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong. Eventually, I called downstairs, and a helpful employee came to the room and restarted the system. ''Sometimes, it has to be rebooted,'' he said. Even when the system works, having to manipulate an on-screen cursor to work the TV takes getting used to.    THE BATHROOM -- Really two rooms: The toilet has its own cubicle on one side of the entry hall","excerpt":"the sink and shower room is on the other. Since most of the rooms lack tubs, you won't get one unless you request it in advance. The shower has one design flaw: Thanks to a large glass panel, if you turn the water on before getting in and it's too hot, there's no way to reach the controls without braving the scalding water. Delicious toiletries from Fresh, including pomegranate conditioning rinse, are some consolation.    ROOM SERVICE -- There is now 24-hour service; not so during my visit in July. There's not much reason to order room-service breakfast -- the buffet, in the downstairs bar, has generous hours (6:30 a.m. to noon on most days) and a terrific selection of fruits, cheeses, freshly baked breads and superb muffins. Before breakfast, I ordered coffee sent to the room. It came in about seven minutes.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- A room for two is $275 (Canadian) on weeknights plus taxes.

I stayed at the Sheraton Krabi Resort near the town of Ao Nang, and the Meridien Phuket Beach Resort near Patong Beach. I also took excursions to Phi Phi Island and Maya Beach (where the film ''The Beach'' was made), Phang Nga Bay and Tapu Island and visited Panyi Island, a Muslim fishing village on stilts. I would like to know what happened to those places.     John Mainz, Toronto      The areas of Thailand's Andaman Coast that were devastated almost four months ago by the tsunami -- primarily in Khao Lak on the mainland north of Phuket in Phangnga province, where more than 4,000 lives were lost, and Phi Phi Island -- are on the way to recovery, though the number of tourists has dropped significantly. Phi Phi could take more than a year to recover. But Ao Maya Beach has returned to its former state, and Ao Nang Beach, near the Sheraton, has almost fully recovered.    On Phuket, about 90 percent of hotels are open, with the rest expecting to reopen in the coming weeks or by October, according to Joan Schechter, marketing manager for the Tourism Authority of Thailand in New York, who visited the region last month. Patong Beach and Kamala Bay are the exceptions, with several hotels still closed or being renovated, including the Meriden Phuket Beach Resort. Ms. Schechter says that except for Khao Lak, with only 5 of 70 hotels operating, and Phi Phi Island, where just 5 or 6 are open, Andaman Coast hotels are up to 40 percent occupancy now, though they are usually almost 80 percent full at this time of year. Tapu Island and Koh Panyi are open for day trips.     The 246-room beachfront Sheraton Krabi Beach Resort, www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton, is in full operation. The 470-room Meridien Phuket Beach Resort, www.lemeridien.com, required substantial repairs and, according to Wong Yin Yin, regional public relations manager for Asia Pacific, Le Meridien Hotels and Resorts, is tentatively scheduled to reopen June 1.

Before the Giants and the Dodgers left for California in 1958, New York City had three teams in three ball parks. What were the dimensions of each of those stadiums down the foul lines and to dead center field?    A.  Based on the final season of three-team baseball in New York, 1957, here's how the distances to clear the fences would have looked to a player stepping up to bat in each ball park:   EBBETS FIELD -- Duke Snider of the Brooklyn Dodgers would have had to belt the ball at least 297 feet to right, 348 to left and a reachable 393 to center.   YANKEE STADIUM -- Mickey Mantle of the New York Yankees would have had to hit the ball at least 296 feet to right field, 301 feet to left field and a tape-measure shot of 461 feet to center field.   POLO GROUNDS -- Willie Mays of the New York Giants would have had to drive a pitch at least 257 feet 8 inches to right, 279 feet to left and an impossible 483 feet to center.   Mays never did reach the center-field bleachers at the Polo Grounds, and only three players -- all on visiting teams -- ever did: Joe Adcock of the Milwaukee Braves in 1953, and Henry Aaron of the Braves and Lou Brock of the Chicago Cubs in 1963, by which time the Giants had relocated to San Francisco and the Mets were subletting the Polo Grounds in its final baseball season. Ryan to Uecker?     Q. A friend swears up hill and down dale that Bob Uecker was the catcher when Nolan Ryan pitched in his first major league game. Could he be correct?    A.  Like Uecker, he must be joking. The wisecracking catcher-turned-broadcaster never played on the same team as Ryan in his fragments of six seasons in the majors. Uecker never even batted against Ryan, let alone caught him, for Ryan pitched in only two games in his first season, 1966, while with the New York Mets and spent 1967 in the minors. Uecker was with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1966, then closed out his career with the Phillies and Atlanta Braves in 1967.   In Ryan's major league debut (two innings in relief of Dick Selma, three strikeouts, one walk, one run, a home run to Joe Torre) during an 8-3 loss to the Atlanta Braves on Sept. 11, 1966, his catcher was Jerry Grote.  Rose Bowl No-Shows     Q. When did the University of California at Berkeley last represent the Pacific-10 Conference in the Rose Bowl and when did Northwestern last represent the Big Ten in that bowl game?    A.  With Joe Kapp at quarterback, California last played in the Rose Bowl in 1959, which was 10 years after Northwestern last did it, against California. The outcome for California in the 1959 game was a 38-12 loss to Iowa, and that was nothing new for the Golden Bears on New Year's Day. They have made eight visits to the game in Pasadena and have won only twice, plus a 0-0 tie with Washington & Jefferson in 1922. The victories were shutouts against Alabama (13-0) in 1938 and Ohio State (28-0) in 1921, Cal's first Rose Bowl game.   Besides Iowa 32 years ago, the teams that have beaten California in the Rose Bowl are Georgia Tech (8-7) in 1929, Northwestern (20-14) in 1949, Ohio State (17-14) in 1950 and Michigan (14-6) in 1951. Besides handing the Golden Bears the first of three Rose Bowl defeats in three straight years, the victory by Northwestern in the Rose Bowl 42 years ago remains extra sweet for the Wildcats, who have not appeared in a bowl game by any other name. Rebounding Lakers     Q. In the \\"By the Numbers\\" column of the The Times's Sunday Sports section on Dec. 16, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was listed as the holder of the Lakers' team record for offensive rebounds (2,494) and defensive rebounds (7,785), but not for total rebounds. That team mark (11,463) was listed for Elgin Baylor. What gives?    A.  What gives the wrong impression in this example is the fact that during Baylor's playing career, from 1958-72, the official National Basketball Association statistics kept for rebounds lumped both kinds. It wasn't until the 1973-74 season, two years after Baylor retired, that the league began to separate offensive and defensive rebounds, and so Abdul-Jabbar, a Laker for 1,093 games from 1975-89, wound up the team leader in both departments.   During the 14 seasons and 846 games in which Baylor grabbed 11,463 rebounds for the Lakers of Minneapolis and Los Angeles, no one knows how many were from shots his team took (offensive) or from shots opposing players took (defensive).  Canadian Football in U.S.     Q. Has the Grey Cup, the Canadian Football League equivalent of the Super Bowl, ever been played in the United States?    A.  Not yet, but one regular-season C.F.L. game was held in Philadelphia. The date was Sept. 14, 1958","excerpt":"the site was Franklin Field, and the reason was the Hamilton Tiger-Cats were in a contract dispute with the owners of their stadium in Ontario. So for one game, the Tiger-Cats crossed the border and borrowed the University of Pennsylania's home field for a C.F.L. game that drew 15,110 fans and resulted in the home team away from home beating the Ottawa Rough Riders, 24-18.    Hamilton even went on to win the Eastern Conference title that year with a 10-3 record, then beat Ottawa twice more in the playoffs before losing the Grey Cup game in Vancouver, 35-28, to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The winning coach of that Grey Cup was Bud Grant, who later was the losing coach in four Super Bowls with the Minnesota Vikings.

The conflict has its roots in separatist drives on the part of Slovenes and Croats who fear a new sense of assertiveness by Serbs in the post-Communist era","excerpt":"the situation is complicated by the fact that large numbers of Serbs have settled amid the other nationalities over the centuries. Since June 25, when Croatia and Slovenia declared their independence of the central Yugoslav Government, ethnic Serbs living in Croatia have revolted and about 350 people have died in violence in that republic, while more than 125,000 have left their homes. Last week, scores of people died in new clashes despite efforts to enforce a cease-fire between units of the federal army and the separatist republic's militia. The army claims only to be trying to separate Croatian units from the rebel forces of ethnic Serbs; last week, however, a European Community envoy, Henry Wijnaendts, agreed with Croatian accusations that the Serb-dominated army was taking the side of the Serb rebels. As the latest cease-fire came apart last week, tanks rolled, mortar fire resounded and Yugoslav army jets bombed targets in and near Vukovar and other Croatian villages.

The story by itself, has been seen elsewhere","excerpt":"the situations date back to when the Victorians were, themselves, the Younger Generation. But Mr. D'Arrast, by a carefree juggling of sense and nonsense, has turned out about an hour's amusement.The story deals with an elderly man who went to Paris when the great drought hit America. He left his wife and daughter behind him, remained in Paris (with all its temptations) for ten years, then, shortly after the picture opens, prepares to welcome his child. She had grown up as they do in America, and that fact provides the basic situation.Aiding and abetting the elderly gentleman is a younger one named Freddie Fletcher. Mr. Fletcher is always missing boats, always smiling and usually ordering dry martinis somewhere or other. He falls in love with the daughter, but, being of America, the latter prefers a Frenchman. The ending comes when the Frenchman, the villain, beats up the hero. That in itself is unusual.Albert Gran takes the part of Willoughy Quimby, the American who went to Paris and gives his characterization with a broad grin. He expects his daughter to be a small girl, but when she appears already grown up he accepts the inevitable. His efforts to rid himself of the attentions of ladies he has known in the Parisian ten years are very amusing.Freddie Fletcher is performed by Matt Moore as a blasé bit of drunkenness, made effective by the fact that he never does come out on top in his arguments with other persons or things. Albert Conti takes the part of Paul de Launay, the Frenchman, and gives it the sophisticated attributes for which he is becoming known.

Those who had encountered the group through recordings on various English labels were not surprised by the wide-ranging, well-judged program: large sacred pieces by John Sheppard, Richard Hygons and Thomas Tallis, together with shorter settings and carols appropriate to the Christmas season.    Although its repertory ranges well into the 20th century, the Sixteen, conducted by Harry Christophers, has done perhaps its most important work in behalf of English composers of the Tudor period. Picking up from the pioneering work of David Wulstan, Mr. Christophers has greatly expanded our knowledge of John Sheppard, resident composer at Magdalen College in Oxford in the second half of the 16th century. Sheppard was represented on Sunday's program by \\"A solis ortus cardine\\" and \\"Verbum caro factum est,\\" each a small masterpiece of stately, intricate polyphony.

STAGE VIEW"},{"year":"1990","title":"IN 1917, John S. Gibson, a drugstore owner in Hope, Ark., created a friendly rivalry in the local watermelon patch by offering an annual cash prize for the largest melon. Since then, the farmers there have been partial to really big melons. Theirs are not the 5- to 8-pound icebox varieties, nor even the 30- to 40-pound melons that often show up in supermarkets, but giants of at least 100 pounds.   It's no wonder that Hope, a small town in southwest Arkansas, is sometimes called the \\"Giant-Watermelon Capital of the World.\\"   Two brothers, Hugh and Edgar Laseter, using seeds they developed themselves, won the prize several years in a row in the early 1920's with melons that tipped the scales at about 100 pounds. At the ninth annual contest in 1925, Hugh caused a stir with a 136-pounder. Shipped to President Calvin Coolidge, it was hailed as the largest on record in this country.   With a reputation as the top grower of outsize watermelons, the town put on the first Hope Watermelon Festival in 1926. That year, Brother Edgar had the champ: 143 1/4 pounds.   But even bigger melons pushed his record aside in the ensuing years, and it was not until 1929 that he again had a champion, this one weighing 152 1/2 pounds. After that, even though the Laseter brothers continued growing melons until they were old men, they never claimed a record again.   In such contests the winning melons are documented, usually with some public revelry, by licensed weighers. The results are published, and if they go uncontested, the grower claims the record. In its seven-decade acquaintance with mammoth melons, Hope has been nudged out of the record only seven times, its residents assert.   Two other Hope residents, Ivan Bright and his son, Lloyd, have kept their town in the forefront in recent years. They have grown giants since 1973, and they set a record in 1979 with a 200-pounder. In 1985, Lloyd's 9-year-old son, Jason, brought one in at 260 pounds. That still stands as the record in the 1990 Guinness Book of World Records, but an out-of-towner has grown a bigger one. In October 1988, Bill Rogerson of Robertsville, N.C., pulled a 279-pounder off his vines. He didn't submit the documentation to the Guinness book in time to get into the 1990 edition, so the 1991 edition will list him as the record-holder since 1988.   The secret of growing giant watermelons is partly in the seed. \\"You've got to plant a variety that makes a large watermelon,\\" said Lloyd Bright. He and his father still grow the kind they started out with, a dark-green variety with light stripes called Carolina Cross. Each year they select seeds from their largest, shapliest melon for planting, along with seeds from other giants. Seeds from winners can fetch $8 and more.   A grower needs the right kind of soil, long warm summers and not too much rainfall. \\"Watermelons do best in fertile, sandy soil that drains well and prefer dry summers with temperatures in the 80's range, night and day,\\" Lloyd Bright said.   It takes 95 to 120 days to grow a mature giant. \\"Our average-size melons weigh around 150 pounds and these are ready in mid-July,\\" said Mr. Bright, who, along with his father, crates and sends them by air freight all over the United States. (The address is Giant Watermelons, P.O. Box 141, Hope, Ark. 71801. The smallest melon shipped - 100 pounds - is $50, but add $40 more for postage and handling.) The rest of the industry grows varieties that range from the 5-pound Sugar Baby \\"peewee\\" to the Jubilee, which can weigh 40 pounds. Depending on variety, the fruit may be round or oblong","excerpt":"the skin varies from solid dark green to mottled or striped green to nearly white, and the flesh from pale pink to deep red. Seeds may be white, brown or black.   With their bright red flesh and lusciously sweet juice, watermelons have been called the food of angels. They also go under such appetizing names as Crimson Sweet, Royal Sweet, Petite Sweet and Sangria. And they aren't just a pretty face. The National Watermelon Association, a trade group, said one pound of watermelon flesh supplies 77 percent of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin C, 35 percent of B6, 26 percent of B1 and 18 percent of A, as well as 7 percent of iron.   Watermelons, which are 8 percent sugar and mostly water otherwise, are frequently used to provide liquid for marathon runners. In Africa, where they originated, the British explorer David Livingstone said he found them growing wild in the Kalahari Desert where, in times of drought, they were the only source of water. The same point was made in a 1924 issue of National Geographic, when another British explorer, Maj. Edward Keith-Roach, reported that watermelons had saved his life during a six-week drought in Africa.   Watermelons were grown in North America at least as far back as 1629, when they were cultivated by colonists in Massachusetts. In 1774 Thomas Jefferson, who planted them in his vast gardens at Monticello, Va., asserted that his were far superior to those grown in France, because in Europe \\"there is not enough sun to ripen them or give them flavor.\\" When buying watermelon slices, choose those with bright color and firm texture. Mealy or dry flesh is an indication of overripeness. To select a whole watermelon take a good look at the skin; although colors vary, the melon should be somewhat dull and velvety, not shiny.   The underside of a perfect melon - the part that touched the ground - is light yellow. As a melon ripens, this area changes from white to pale green to light yellow to deep yellow.   Immature melons are preferred for making watermelon-rind pickles. The National Watermelon Association recommends Charleston Gray for its thin, tender rind, but others can be used.   A 20- to 30-pound watermelon will serve 15 to 20 people. Melons do not need refrigeration until cut and, in fact, lose color and flavor after chilling for a week at 32 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Keeping a melon at room temperature can improve the flavor and color, as long as it is not kept more than seven days after picking.   \\"Fresh-picked watermelons have a 'green' flavor,\\" said Lloyd Bright. \\"They taste sweeter and riper if left to set up for a few days.\\"   This year's Hope Watermelon Festival will be from Aug. 16 to 19.

You are never anxious about the plight of the heroine, because you have every reason to suppose that the big sailor in the end will ask her to be his bride. This whole picture lacks imagination, and while the direction of Ralph Ince is not bad, he spoils some scenes by insisting upon showing close-ups of Patsy Ruth Miller in the various stages of sobbing. Mr. Ince, himself, portrays the leading male character, \\"Hurricane\\" Haley, and his performance is quite competent, worthy, in fact, of a bettery story.This yarn of a dancing place in bygone days and the \\"old davil sea\\" was at first called \\"Polly of Limehouse.\\" In the early chapters one might suppose that \\"Hurricane\\" Haley was doing the drunken-sailor act with a vengeance, for he gives away fifteen dollars to a mendicant and appears to be ready to spend a small fortune before the sun rises. Soon after he meets Polly (Miss Miller) he is picked out by the dance-hall proprietor as an excellent subject for knockout drops. The unsuspecting \\"Hurricane\\" Haley drinks everything that is given to him and it is not long before his pockets are unceremoniously emptied.Mr. Haley believes that Polly helped the crooks and he decides on a plan of revenge. He kidnaps Polly and takes her out to sea, where after some humiliating attempts at dancing on a hatch cover, Polly, one is informed in the subtitles, learns to use sea terms and she wages war on the cook when he attempts to steal a kiss.The ship's mate rather likes Polly and this causes Haley to change the course of his vessel, so that he can send Polly to San Francisco by another vessel. Months or years may pass, for all one knows, but Polly and Haley meet again. So the subtitle writer, who strives so hard to be nautical, sets forth as coming from Haley:\\"We are going back to the sea—back to where we both belong.\\"And, as you might suppose, \\"Hurricane\\" Haley's tatooed arms are wrapped around Polly. There is a quick fade-out, and soon there is another lovely \\"spot\\" of a ship at sea, and then comes a close-up of Haley and Polly, who are both at the helm and evidently quite friendly.

Burwell, Mt. Morris, Mich.: Maybe people like my husband and me dont show up in the polls, but we have spent considerable time discussing infrastructure in the U.S.A. One would have to be blind not to see the decay everywhere. Our pet peeve is the state of railroading. We know the technology exists, because other countries have done it, to make railroads a dynamic part of our transportation system. Using railroads at full potential would remove many of the big trucks which prematurely destroy roads and clog highway traffic.     I would be willing to have my taxes raised if the rich also give up their recent super tax cuts and pay tolls if it meant good roads, dependable electricity, ongoing research for clean, alternative power sources, a super railroad system to move goods around the country and the all the jobs created to get this work done. No more earmarks! As suggested, we need a bipartisan strategy, that combines public and private efforts, for bringing Americas infrastructure into the new millennium. A+ to The New York Times for focusing on this issue.     Daniel OConnell, Phoenix: I agree wholeheartedly with your claims concerning the necessity of upgraded infrastructures both in the realms of transportation and communication for a competitive and productive future in the United States. How long can the U.S. afford to ignore the potential benefits of more developed railway infrastructures both within cities and regions and between them? Traffic, pollution, and extreme drains on water and other resources are all being caused by the cars driven and endless urban sprawling occurring in so many American cities today. Phoenix is now much like L.A. There are thousands of people who live more than 20 to 30 miles from where they work. People continue to push farther out from the city to chase cheap housing, their own plot of land. However, as these thousands of people commute to downtown Phoenix for work, streets and highways experience what are now considered normal backups that are near gridlocks for hours at time. And this is fueling the push for even more and even wider streets and highways. The U.S. and Phoenix must break this dependence on cars and highways. Railways and better urban planning and reorganization must become factors if Americans are to remain both economically competitive and environmentally conscious.     Lukas Rosenthaler, Allschwil, Switzerland: One piece of infrastructure thats often overlooked are the railroads. While Europe and Asia invest large sums into the railroads, Americas railroads often look like those in Third World countries. The dismal state of Amtrak is basically due to a grossly negligent disinterest by the government, but also the freight-only lines are often in a rotten state. During the 1970s, many railroad lines were abandoned, single-tracked etc., and maintenance has been neglected. This capacity is missing now and a quick fix is not possible. Facing ever increasing prices of oil, facing terrorist threats to the airline industry where each plane can be turned into a flying bomb, passenger rail must become again a valuable option for travel.      Daniel Gottlieb, Vermont: I appreciate your insightful and largely balanced comments. However, you dont discuss efficiency or the goal. Is the goal to reduce traffic time to zero? If so, we just need triple the number of roads, costing us billions, reducing quality of life, guaranteeing auto dependence and increasing sprawl. What were doing now, just reacting, clearly isnt the right solution. ... Its often cheaper overall to pay people to use less than to collectively pay for additional infrastructure. The advantages of getting by with less are manifold reduced energy dependency, less pollution, reduced global warming, better Q.O.L. etc. Building more is sometimes the right way to go, but certainly not always. Its time we think outside the box or perhaps just exhibit a bit of Yankee frugality.     Nicholas Kulish responds: Good points, all. I am a big supporter of public transportation and both commuter and freight trains. Energy-efficient transportation is an important goal for our society, as are combating sprawl and cutting back fuel consumption. But we still need good roads. It will take a lot of work to change the driving culture in America.     Alan Walker, Toronto: I read the posted article and agree with its direction. I do have to comment, as a recent visitor to the Northeast states. We drove from Toronto through New York state, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Whether an interstate, a toll road, and in particular secondary highways, we were hugely impressed by the quality and condition of the roads. We were wandering from New York City suburbs, to the major interstates, to quiet byways. All were in superb condition, regrettably far superior to roads in Canada.     Nell Painter, Newark, N.J.: Thank you so much for talking about this! After a trip to Tokyo in 2004 I returned to the N.Y./N.J. metropolitan region, where thank you for your patience signs were everywhere, especially around crucial public transportation. I felt like I lived in a Third World country.     Christos Talanoz, Munich: Excellent piece. I was born in Germany, but educated in the United States. It was the United States that taught me about being pro-active and thinking ahead. Surprising then that so many European and Asian countries seem like space age societies when it comes to comparing their infrastructure to Americas. I just dont understand it. However, I do think it really boils down to public policy. If Americans would just set their priorities a tad differently, there would be no talk about crumbling infrastructure or crumbling health care.     America has some of the smartest people in the world. All you need now is a government that sets priorities a bit smarter as well! The people who say let private firms take care of all of this are simply wrong. The private sector must thrive, but government must do the infrastructure things which do not pay off in the short term.     I think that is what it boils down to : There is this American myth that everything government does is bad. It is created by the conservative government itself. Why ? The myth allows the government to take tax payer money, not spend it on its people and get away with it. The myth allows government to fraudulently pour tax payer money into a few big private pockets, with everyone just shrugging their shoulders saying, See, I told you government is incompetent. That is unacceptable and you must demand that the formidable resources of the U.S. government be put to good use to support the wider economic interest of the people of the United States.      Nicholas Kulish responds: I think Americans became complacent in part because our infrastructure used to be so good. We have a hard time imagining that we might have somehow slipped behind the rest of the world. But Ive seen testimony before Congress that China is pumping $60 billion into its high-speed Internet network each year. My colleague here at The Times, Amy Waldman, wrote a series on the new highways India is building. Increasingly, were lagging behind the pack. If we dont reverse the trend it will come back to haunt us. Sounds like the Canadians are having some trouble too.      Richard Pasquier, Wynnewood, Pa.: I was glad to see the topic of our declining infrastructure tackled by a member of the New York Times Editorial Board. I have made improving infrastructure and devising means for making the necessary investments affordable for the nation a personal crusade of mine. In my opinion, there will be no improvement in our national efforts unless we consider alternative funding arrangements to our current budget process. And mere capital budgeting is not enough. I suggest that we return to the model of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (R.F.C.), the institution used from the 1930s through the 1950s to build much of the infrastructure referred to in the article.      Nicholas Kulish responds: I havent studied the R.F.C., but have seen it criticized for excessive bureaucracy during the Hoover Administration. Maybe thats a bad rap though. When I was an economics reporter at The Wall Street Journal, my boss, Jacob M. Schlesinger, believed that President Hoover was unappreciated and underestimated. Im in favor of exploring any new model for deploying our resources effectively.     Margaret Meredith, Maastricht, The Netherlands: Im thrilled to see that someone affiliated with an established institution ... finally noticed that the nations infrastructure is literally falling apart. I noticed years ago when I lived in Washington D. C. that the citys infrastructure was in terrible shape. It is our nations capital, after all. I moved to San Diego where there is still a lot of investment in the citys infrastructure, largely because of its rapid growth. Every time I return to the east coast or drive from it to the west coast, Im shocked by the state of the infrastructure. Our streets, highways, and mass transportation systems are precisely what make it possible to build and live in our society. Our lives and livelihoods depend on them. They are thus unavoidably a vital public good. The problem is, as the author said, the issue of their upkeep makes voters yawn. But I would argue that the reason it does so is the fault of our congressmen and political leaders over the last 30 years, Democrats and Republicans alike, who have failed to make it their responsibility to keep it on the public agenda. Why? Because it translates into higher taxes and lost elections....     Lee Bartkowski, Long Beach, Calif.: Youll recall that Ross Perot suggested a 0.50 per gallon infrastructure tax during his campaign, and you know how much traction that got. I dont know the answer, but state and federal fuel taxes are already earmarked for highways. I like the idea of tolls bridges, freeways, etc. you pay as you go. I think until the involvement in Iraq is concluded, infrastructure will be a tough sell. Then a public service announcement blitz can begin citing the necessity to take care of ourselves for a while. Messages like, Wouldnt it be nice if the U.S. had roads and bridges as nice as those in France?     Nicholas Kulish responds: I had forgotten about Mr. Perots proposal. We would certainly be in a lot better shape if something like that had gone through, but Im not sure middle-class commuters would have let Congress pass it. But Perot at least would have taken it to the voters and tried to explain it to them in plain, frank language. Thats what we need right now. Infrastructure was getting a lot more attention in the early 1990s than it does now. Sadly its still off the radar for most people.     Diana Collins, Charlotte, N.C.: Yes I agree we need to make a lot of investments in our infrastructure, but it will never happen. People cant see beyond the end of their own nose these days. And if a number of people could see the benefit of investment in infrastructure, the Republicans are always there to shoot down anything that would benefit the country.     They only like projects that are sure to bankrupt the nation, like a good old war we cant win! This country will crumble, and it will be left behind in every sense. Get used to the idea, and blame the cheapskates.     Lawrence Light, Mission Viejo, Calif.: Thus far, the current administration has siphoned off the monies required to repair our infrastructure by spending on the Iraq war, agreeing to vast amounts of defense spending, creating an environment in which oil prices can rise as high as the oil companies would like, creating tax breaks for a very small segment of the population that must be made up by the rest if any money is to be raised. Sure, your editorial piece says it nicely but I can see no way that the pigs who have been so accustomed to using the government trough will ever give up such a lucrative conduit for this kind of money. Perhaps when the oceans rise six to twelve inches or a military draft is instituted or oil hits $200 a barrel will any action be taken and, by then, it may be too late.     David J. Andrews, New York.: There is no hope of fixing Americas broken infrastructure as long as we are embracing the tax-cut and make war policies of the Bush administration. We really cant have it both ways costly tax cuts for the rich, make-believe wars on terrorism and unbelievable graft and corruption all add up to one inescapable conclusion: America will be left to disintegrate while the rich get richer and the world becomes more hostile to what we used to think of as American values. We really are the dumbest people on Earth.     Nicholas Kulish responds: I wish the money we have spent and are going to spend on the Iraq war had been used instead on American infrastructure but Im not so sure that would have happened. Its just as likely that the difference would have gone toward repealing the estate tax or missile defense. If anything is going to happen on this issue though I think its going to have to be approached in a nonpartisan manner. The business community could be a strong voice and one that Republicans would listen to in favor of improving our physical network. A strong, productive country should resonate with voters and interest groups from both parties, with the exception of the drown-government-in-the-bathtub crowd.     J. Kelly Conklin, Glen Ridge, N.J.: There is one important issue unmentioned in Nicholas Kulishs piece. Who will do the work? Who will put up the forms, pour the concrete, run the pipe and the wire? Who will form the steel and run the track? In the future advocated by our national leaders, they will have to be imported. The guest worker program our president is proposing is no accident it is a necessity.     In a recent Times Magazine article about the re-emergence of nuclear power, it was mentioned in passing that we lack the capacity in this country to build the huge steel vessels required for a nuclear reactor. The point being that, that inadequate capacity could be an impediment to expanding our nuclear power generating capacity. You think?     Despite the obvious need for skilled, well-trained and motivated workers to do the sweaty, dirty and physically demanding work that road construction, tunnel digging and reactor building require, we as a nation do less with every passing year to prepare and encourage that work force to develop.

Of the images included here, only the first portrays a living person -- his uncle, shown from the back as he wheels his tools into the barn. Mr. Morris searches for human presence in weathered farm buildings, bureau tops and barber chairs. Some of the images show farmhouse interiors with old photographs of family members. Mr. Morris's yearning for a past impossible to recover, and his good eye for revealing detail, are what animate these photos and make them compelling.

As the Mets returned from a road trip in which they lost seven of nine games, and saw two pitchers go down from injuries, and had few of the hitters hitting and only an occasional fielder fielding, and which the manager summed up as \\"a disaster,\\" the clubhouse smelled only of the aromas of old: the scent of leather from the baseball gloves, the whiff of liniment from the trainer's room, and the expected fumes from the inside of their spiked shoes.   On the field, there was the smell of grass and dirt upon which their spiked shoes trod, and, if close enough, one could inhale that welcome sniff of the wood of the bats and the horsehide of the ball.

Doctors, of course, can be expected to hold firm views on such a matter and I heard from several. One, Dr. M. Eugenia Geib, was reminded of an inquest she held in Opera News, Feb. 2, 1952, on several operatic corpses, including ''some cases in which the librettist's diagnosis is scarcely tenable.''

Above and below, to the left and to the right, lie other apartments or offices, other families or businesses. Tall buildings have become such a humdrum component of city life that to look up at them is to risk being branded a tourist.   But city dwellers have grown a bit more introspective lately about their towering surroundings. Perhaps the unexamined life is not worth living after all. A museum dedicated to the history of the skyscraper is being planned for Lower Manhattan, and a number of authors have delved into the topic. Here are four books that examine Manhattan's skyward growth.     RISE OF THE NEW YORK SKYSCRAPER, 1865-1913      By Sarah Bradford Landau  and Carl W. Condit   Yale University Press    The efforts of nearly 40 years reached a climax in a series of six skyscrapers, five of them completed, under construction, or projected by 1910, and the sixth, after long consideration, begun in 1913. All revealed the results of technical progress in their spectacular height and culmination of formal mastery along the main avenues of development. In chronological order, they were the Singer Tower, notable for its needlelike form and sheer Beaux-Arts audacity","excerpt":"the soaring and majestic neo-Renaissance campanile known as the Metropolitan Life Tower; the Municipal Building, a monumental demonstration of ''Modern Renaissance'' classicism; the Bankers Trust Building, a splendid ''Grecian'' campanile; the watershed Woolworth Building, aptly designated the ''Cathedral of Commerce'', and, finally, the new Equitable Building, more notorious than appreciated, but certainly the embodiment of the last blast of the out-of-control density that plagued the city.    HISTORIC MANHATTAN APARTMENT HOUSES       By Andrew Alpern   Dover Publications    Prior to the mid-1920's, apartment-house roofs were given over to elevator machinery and water tanks. Occasionally they were also used for accommodating janitors' apartments or additional maids' quarters, but rooftop living for socially self-conscious New Yorkers was almost unheard of. The concept of terraced country living in the city had yet to emerge.   At least one early attempt had been made to use an apartment-house roof more creatively, however. Architect Julain Clarence Levi was living in 1905 in an apartment of a since-demolished building at West 81st Street and West End Avenue. At the time, there was nothing blocking the view of the Hudson River from the upper floors. However, the Levis' apartment faced an inner courtyard.   Levi approached the building's owner and proposed that he be allowed to cut through the roof and install a circular stairway that would connect his apartment to an enclosed gazebo and open-air deck that he would construct on the roof. Although his landlord was sympathetic, and was convinced that Levi would erect a well-constructed and tastefully designed adjunct to his apartment, he declined to grant permission. His response was, ''Mr. Levi, when you move out at the end of your lease, what will I do with your stairway and your gazebo? Who would ever want to live on a roof!''    FORM FOLLOWS FINANCE      By Carol Willis  Princeton Architectural Press    The average height of major New York office buildings increased through the twenties. Around 1925, large projects were generally between 30 and 40 stories; by the end of the decade, the minimum height for a building with a tower in an area such as Wall Street or Grand Central was around 40 to 45 stories, even for lots as small as 11,000-12,000 square feet. Moreover there were about a dozen skyscrapers taller than 50 floors, including four around 70 stories, and the Empire State, with 85 office floors.    ELEGANT NEW YORK THE BUILDERS AND THE BUILDINGS, 1885-1915      By John Tauranac  and Christopher Little   Abbeville Press   The odds are that if you ask the name of the greatest clubman, first nighter or host of the Age of Elegance, you'll hear Stanford White. You will also hear that he was the most generous and least mean-spirited of men, and possibly its most profligate and licentious as well. Likewise, every New York building of architectural pretension was attributed to him, to the point that it would have taken him several lifetimes to design them. But with white stone and yellow terra cotta he did begin to transform the city from a monotonously dull brown place to one of lightness and fascination, and the metamorphosis began in earnest with his design for Madison Square Garden. The City Skyline And Landscape"},{"year":"1991","title":"WHEN the Labor Department releases its monthly reports on inflation, they often include this sort of sentence: \\"Tobacco products (mainly cigarettes) were among the items that rose most sharply in price.\\" Fewer and fewer Americans smoke. And the danger to health is a huge disincentive. But in the last decade, no other single item in the Consumer Price Index has gone up as much as cigarettes.

With tens of thousands still unaccounted for, especially in remote regions, the toll seemed certain to continue climbing.   A1    Indonesian officials said 4,775 people had been confirmed dead in North Sumatra, where Aceh sits, near the epicenter of the quake. The United Nations office in Jakarta received an unconfirmed report that as many as 40,000 people had perished in the town of Meulaboh on Sumatra's western shore.   A1    Among the tens of thousands of people missing or dead, thousands are believed to have come from outside the region, including many tourists. Reported deaths now cover at least 40 nationalities.   A1    Rapidly climbing death estimates are likely to be highly inaccurate for some time, despite the best efforts of aid officials to nail them down, experts said. The most recent estimates would make the tsunami death toll the worst in recorded history.   A6    Rejecting a United Nations official's suggestion that it had been a ''stingy'' aid donor, the Bush administration announced an increase of $20 million, bringing the total to $35 million, in relief for victims and dispatched an aircraft carrier and other ships to the region for relief operations.

The profit decline was caused by a combination of three things, Casey Powell, Sequent's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.

If the weather is mild, spray evergreens with anti-dessicants. Continue to prune trees and shrubs. Now's the time to haul out the power tools and get them serviced before they're needed. Wall Covering     Q.    My daughter's school has several concrete walls that we would like to cover with vines. One faces west, another faces south and is shaded by deciduous trees. What hardy, preferably evergreen, plants would you recommend for this environment? B.M., Ridgewood, N.J.     A. Wayne Cahilly, vine expert at the New York Botanical Garden, recommends any of several euonymus vines. The species fortuniae is handsome, covers a wall well and is tolerant of harsh conditions. It may be a bit slow getting started and welcome a line of hardware cloth ( 1/2-inch-by- 1/2-inch-square wire mesh) run along the base of the wall to help it on its way upward. A cultivar of this species, coloratus, has pink-edged leaves, turning purple in the winter. An old standby is the tough-as-nails English ivy. You might find attractive cultivars at local nurseries. One popular variety sold in the area has the delightful name 238th Street ivy. It was developed decades ago by T.H. Everett from cuttings collected from a church wall on 238th Street in the Bronx. Fooling Bulbs    Q.    In the fall I potted tulip and daffodil bulbs and sank the pots in the garden, to be brought inside later for forcing. Can the bulbs in their pots be \\"fooled\\" into blooming another year like normal garden bulbs if I put them back into the ground when they have finished blooming? A.C., Spring Grove, Pa.     A. According to Michael Ruggiero of the New York Botanical Garden, you should have no trouble \\"fooling\\" your daffodils as long as they are not paper-whites. Tulips are another matter. Their bulbs tend to split and produce mostly leaves the second time around. Potbound Bonsai     Q.    I have raised two lantana stadards as bonsai. They have thick, woody trunks and must be six to eight years old. Since they have become potbound, I decided to try a drastic experiment on one. In December I took it out of its pot to find a mass of tangled roots. I did a hard root pruning and removed considerable top growth, then reset it in the same pot with fresh soil and watered it well. Gradually all the leaves withered and fell. In January a few tiny green nubs appeared, but didn't make it, and there is no new growth. I'm devastated, along with the plant. Should I have waited until spring to do the job? R.E., Scarsdale, N.Y.     A. Spring is the preferred season for repotting bonsai. However, root pruning and repotting of bonsai are complex, difficult tasks. Even moderate root pruning can be dangerous, even fatal, to the plant if not done properly. Part of the trick is to avoid cutting the tiny feeder roots while trimming the larger ones. Repotting can traumatize a bonsai","excerpt":"the soil composition and amount of water provided are of critical importance. An accurate description of proper root pruning and repotting techniques is found in \\"Indoor Bonsai\\" by Paul Lesniewicz (available from Sterling Publishing Company in New York, soft-cover, $14.95). One of the best ways to learn these techniques is to take a course in bonsai care to get hands-on experience.

At least there were some who had that problem Friday night when the film was given an unannounced preview at the Coronet, supplementing the regular program, headed by \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.\\"It was a disastrous combination. \\"Baby Love\\" is a straightforward, skin-deep narrative movie that elicits conventional responses to familiar stimuli. \\"Teorema\\" (theorem) is a parable, a movie of realistic images photographed and arranged with a mathematical precision that drains them of comforting emotional meaning. For the moviegoer whose sensibilities have been preset to receive \\"Baby Love\\"—or just about any other movie now in first run here—\\"Teorema\\" is likely to be a calamitous and ridiculous experience.The laughter the other night didn't really bother me—although that sort of laughter always surprises me, the way I'm surprised by audiences who go to all the trouble of getting into a Museum of Modern Art screening of, say, \\"As You Desire Me,\\" and then giggle at some perfectly respectable but archaic 1932 movie convention. \\"Teorema\\" is a cranky and difficult film made fascinating by the fact that Pasolini has quite consciously risked just the sort of response he was given by the Coronet patrons.To the extent that it has a coherent narrative, \\"Teorema\\" is the story of an upper middle-class Milanese family that is suddenly visited by a beautiful young man (Terence Stamp) who systematically proceeds to make love to everyone in the family — father (Massimo Girotti), mother (Silvana Mangano), daughter (Anna Wiazemsky), son (Andres José Cruz Soublette) and even the maid (Laura Betti), in roughly the reverse of that order.Having provided each member of the household with an apparently transcendental experience, the young man departs, leaving each to collapse in his own way. Because they are materialistic, rich bourgeoisie, their collapses are elegant and terrifying. The daughter withdraws into a catatonic state","excerpt":"the son withdraws into his painting, determined to set up his own rules of esthetics that are so mysterious he cannot be judged; the mother and father seek to repeat their experiences with counterfeits of the young man. However, the maid, the good, decent, believing peasant woman, becomes sanctified.\\"Teorema\\" is not my favorite kind of film. It is open to too many whimsical interpretations grounded in Pasolini's acknowledged Marxism and atheism, which, like Bunuel's anticlericism, serve so well to affirm what he denies. Pasolini has stated that the young man is not meant to represent Jesus in a Second Coming. Rather, he says, the young man is god, any god, but the fact remains that he is God in a Roman Catholic land.Unlike Tennessee Williams, who toyed with a variation on this theme in much more simplistic terms in \\"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore\\" (\\"Boom\\" went the movie), Pasolini doesn't load this film with little capsulated messages of purple prose. There is very little dialogue in the movie—923 words, say the ads (but I'm not sure whether this refers to the Italian dialogue or the English subtitles). Even though Pasolini is a talented novelist and poet, the film is almost completely visual. The actors don't act, but simply exist to be photographed. The movie itself is the message, a series of cool, beautiful, often enigmatic scenes that flow one into another with the rhythm of blank verse.This rhythm—one of the legacies of the silent film, especially of silent film comedy—was impossible for the Coronet audience to accept. The seductions are ticked off one after the other with absolutely no thought of emotional continuity. So are the individual defeats, which are punctuated by recurring shots of a desolate, volcanic landscape swept by sulphurous mists.There is also a kind of rhythm within the images. Someone seen in right profile is immediately repeated in left profile. An action that proceeds to the left across the screen may be switched 90 degrees, directly away from the camera, or into the camera. Early scenes are in black and white. Later scenes are so muted they almost look like the old Cinecolor process, only to go monochromatic again at the end.\\"Teorema\\" is a highly personal, open-ended movie, and one that is much more interesting to me than Pasolini's earlier \\"Accatone\\" and \\"The Gospel According to St. Matthew.\\" Not the least mysterious thing about it is why the Roman Catholic Church's film reviewing body, the Office Catholique International du Cinéma, originally saw fit to give it a prize, which it later regretted. \\"Teorema\\" is a religious film, but I think it would take a very hip Jesuit to convert it into a testament to contemporary Roman Catholic dogma.

And there's something spooky in two foreboding songs about love: ''God Was in the Water'' and ''Deep Water,'' which includes the album's title. On the first of her albums that she has produced herself, Ms. Raitt wasn't frivolous. The love songs are suffused with struggle and loss, and she places existential musings, like ''Crooked Crown,'' in low-slung grooves. But her slide guitar stays feisty, and no one is likely to argue when she sings, ''Ain't nothing that a fighting heart won't do.''    David Gray       The first single from David Gray's album ''Life in Slow Motion'' (ATO/RCA) has an ordinary title -- ''The One I Love'' -- and secondhand music, virtually quoting Bruce Springsteen. But the seeming familiarity is a fake-out","excerpt":"the song is narrated by a man who has just been shot and is ''leaking blood.'' Mr. Gray has now headlined arenas, and on this album he's not recording in his bedroom anymore; his harried, raspy voice has richer-sounding instruments and more space around it. But he's as glum and plaintive as ever in songs that can be bare-faced confessions or elusive meditations, and the music's new expansiveness only makes him sound more convincingly alone.    Kronos Quartet and Asha Bhosle       The first reaction to the album ''You've Stolen My Heart'' (Nonesuch) might be ''Where's Kronos?'' Performing filmi -- songs from Bollywood musicals -- by the wildly eclectic composer R.D. Burman, Kronos becomes a backup band for Asha Bhosle, Burman's widow and the superstar of filmi singers. Burman was equally likely to borrow from raga, rumba or psychedelic rock, and Kronos doesn't try to reduce his arrangements to string-quartet pieces; its members and guest musicians overdub multiple instruments. Returning to songs she sang decades ago, Ms. Bhosle sounds less blithe and girlish, more pensive. Her sobriety suits earnest performances that honor Burman's pop tunes but can't recapture the sheer nuttiness of the originals.    Thione Seck       A Senegalese singer backed by Indian veena, sarod and tablas? That's only one of the globe-hopping surprises on Thione Seck's ''Orientation'' (Stern's Africa). Mr. Seck, a griot who sang in the 1970's with the pioneering Senegalese band Orchestra Baobab, uses musicians from Egypt, India, Senegal and France on this album, and his remarkable, chameleonic voice travels just as far. It can be full-throated, taut and sinuous for arabesques or light and supple for Bollywood-tinged songs, though the passion is undiminished. His international ambitions yield musical delights.    Charlie Wilson       Like 1960's rockers rallying around an older bluesman, hip-hop and R&B fans of Charlie Wilson, and of the 1980's Gap Band hits he sang, provide songs and duet partners for him on ''Charlie, Last Name Wilson'' (Jive). Mr. Wilson isn't playing the elder statesman, though. The album's executive producer, R. Kelly, has reinvented Mr. Wilson as a less troubled, huskier-voiced version of himself. Mr. Wilson is full of come-ons and promises, and not shy about self-promotion: the album's title song and first single moans about how hard it is for someone rich and famous to find a lover. The tracks are lean, and the guest rappers (Twista, Snoop Dogg, Will.I.Am,) are clever. But the funniest song is ''No Words,'' which starts out crooning a woman's romantic advice to her man and turns into an all-out indictment of a lazy, unemployed, club-hopping sponge.    Ali Farka Touré/Toumani Diabaté       Two musicians from Mali -- the guitarist Ali Farka Touré, from the north, and Toumani Diabaté, a Mande griot from the south -- share crystalline, hypnotic duets on ''In the Heart of the Moon'' (Nonesuch). Mr. Touré picks steadfast, austere patterns; Mr. Diabaté, playing the traditional kora (harp-guitar), sends lines dancing and fluttering above and through the grid of guitar. Subtle accompaniment is overdubbed on some tracks, but it's unnecessary: the beauty is in the unadorned blend of sage simplicity and youthful impulsiveness.    Iron and Wine/Calexico       The reveries of Sam Beam, the whispery songwriter who performs as Iron and Wine, move to some Southwestern frontier on ''In the Reins'' (Overcoat Recordings), his seven-song collaboration with the mariachi-laced alt-country band Calexico. He gives Calexico sincerity, and it lends him roots and instrumental atmosphere, as he sings about range-riding, prison, the Devil, the landscape, death and true love. The gems are ''History of Lovers,'' a calm boogie about crazy jealousy, and ''Burn That Broken Bed,'' which wonders ''When are you coming back?,'' as twin trumpets help him ponder.    Black Dice       A ceaseless beat runs through the songs on ''Broken Ear Record'' (DFA/Astralwerks), the latest EP from the improvisational noise band Black Dice. It comes from looped sounds -- including the distorted remnants of drums, along with guitars, keyboards and sound effects -- that pump steadily while the contents of the loops gradually change. Around the beat, guitars freak out, voices moan and melodic bits appear only to be sucked into the latest loop. It's nagging and absorbing music: a merciless urban pulse and noise that might qualify, in some other dimension, as funk.

Mr. Zenón -- a Puerto Rican-born jazz saxophonist and composer with an evidently enormous brain -- has constructed the album around the tradition of the back-country troubadours of Puerto Rico. Folk melodies make little appearances, as well as a lot of other curious stuff that needn't concern you: for instance, the music refers to the décima, the old Puerto Rican form of improvised songs with 10-line stanzas, by playing with the numbers 5 and 10. (Ten tracks, fifth chords and so on.) Mr. Zenón composes his music down to the dot, yet it breathes: he changes currents and leaves space. And then he plays hard through it all, with a bright, clear alto saxophone sound like Charlie Parker's ballad tone.    Keith Jarrett      ''Radiance,'' Mr. Jarrett's fascinating new live album on ECM is 17 distinct, discrete chunks of completely improvised music. Meaning, he didn't have prepared material to play each time the applause faded. Grooves do make appearances, but surprisingly few: the album is either more delicate or obdurate, with harmony and rhythm stretched all over the place. (Most impressively, among the free-jazz, instant hymns and instant flamenco, some pieces sound like instant American ballad standards.) It is the sureness of his switches among moods, patterns and tonal areas that really gives a start: the best moments are always at the start of the next piece. Mr. Jarrett opens himself up and sets adrift, but somewhere in his mind a clock is ticking. He works toward an exit appropriate to the flow of the piece, or gracefully organizes a closing theme from a motif that he's hit upon earlier.    Luciana Souza      When she sings her highly literate texts in English -- more often than not they have been her own jazz settings of poems by Neruda or Elizabeth Bishop or others -- Ms. Souza is all hesitant midrange control, transmitting the seriousness of her purpose. When she sings in Portuguese, as she does for all of ''Duos II'' (Sunnyside), some other door opens. (For what it's worth, she is Brazilian, but has lived half her life in America.) Even more than on ''Brazilian Duos,'' the excellent record that preceded this one, she puts her vibrato to use, and makes strong flights into notes that are unusually high for her. But as was the last album, this one is all voice-and-guitar duets, with the guitarists Romero Lubambo, Guilherme Monteiro, Marco Pereira and Swami Jr.","excerpt":"the songs are a little less-known than last time, written by composers like Chico Buarque; Ms. Souza's godfather, Hermeto Pascoal; and the old samba master Nelson Cavaquinho.    Marc Ribot      ''Spiritual Unity'' is the self-titled album by the guitarist's new group, which plays nothing but Albert Ayler music. Mr. Ribot dealt with Ayler on his solo albums ''Don't Blame Me'' and ''Saints,'' and, with just the right quantity of original cussedness, showed him to be a skilled composer, not only a gnashing abstract improviser. The band, as heard on its first album, ''Bells,'' (Pi Recordings) includes the trumpeter Roy Campbell Jr. and the drummer Chad Taylor, as well as the bassist Henry Grimes, who performed with Ayler during the 1960's. It's pretty good, although for some questionable reason of aesthetics, Mr. Grimes sounds as if he's playing through an electric shaver. The exception is a live recording of the band playing ''Bells,'' with Mr. Ribot's filthiest solo, a proper-sounding bass and a feeling of spontaneous arrangement.    Four Tet      Kieran Hebden, the only member of Four Tet, does a good thing with the concept of genre: he abuses it. On ''Everything Ecstatic'' (Domino), his fourth album, every rhythm-loop snatched from a record is altered and chopped up instead of left to stagnate; every bit of singing is used for maximum melodic efficiency, instead of left to become a soggy drone; every style of music that he lets you get a peep of, whether it's funk or free jazz or folk or noisy rock or the machinelike Can rhythms he loves so much, are set in less familiar contexts. (It's all for the sake of pleasure. You'd think that solitary laptop auteurs have endless freedom at their fingertips, but they often plug along in a single categorical style; Mr. Hebden shows you a spectrum of 20 colors when you're used to seeing only a few.

The great baritone Hermann  Prey has been a consistent champion of this prolific German composer, who was born in late 1796, just two months before Schubert, but who lived much longer, until the age of 73. Mr. Prey devoted his recital on Saturday night at the 92d Street Y to 14 ballads by Loewe. The performances, with the superb pianist Michael Endres, were revelatory. Loewe's neglect never seemed more inexplicable.         A criticism of his songs that has managed to stick is that in comparison with Schubert's miraculous subtleties, Loewe is too literal, that his songs are mere  musical dramatizations of the texts. (Loewe favored long narrative poems that told stories steeped in mythology and folklore.) But in understanding his work it is critical to remember that he was a fine baritone and a fleet pianist who performed these songs accompanying himself. His ballads work more effectively in performance than an examination of the scores would suggest. Even recordings are not ideal.

Schindler, who was celebrated in the Academy Award-winning Steven Spielberg film ''Schindler's List,'' saved the Jews from Nazi death camps by employing them in the factory. The museum will house modern art and a permanent exhibition devoted to Schindler, who died at 66 in 1974.    'Doubt' Pays Off       In an era when serious plays have had a hard time attracting Broadway audiences, John Patrick Shanley's ''Doubt'' has become an exception to the rule. The Broadway production of the Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning drama about suspected child abuse in a Roman Catholic school has recouped its $2 million investment in 15 weeks, entering the profit column in the week of June 13 through 19, its press representatives announced. It began previews at the Walter Kerr Theater on March 9 and opened on March 31.

Meryl Tankard will handle the choreography, and the flying and climbing design will be the work of Pichon Baldinu, who created and directed ''De La Guarda.''    Low Behavior, High Art       Celebrity scandal has become fodder for art. The collector Charles Saatchi has bought paintings of the places where Hugh Grant was arrested for lewd conduct with a prostitute and where Winona Ryder was arrested for shoplifting, the BBC reported. He plans to exhibit the works, by Dwayne Moser, in his gallery in County Hall in London next year. Mr. Moser, an American who has produced a series of paintings inspired by celebrity scandal, said, ''I am interested in turning the site of an off-screen event in a film star's life into a backdrop, thus suggesting the very public nature of their 'private' lives.'' The BBC said Mr. Saatchi was believed to have paid about $11,000 for the Grant painting.    Adieu, Sizzla       The dancehall reggae star Sizzla has lost another gig. In the latest cancellation attributable to his penchant for homophobic lyrics, a Paris reggae festival has been called off after complaints by gay rights groups that the lyrics incited violence against homosexuals, Agence France-Presse reported. Sizzla, whose real name is Miguel Collins, was one of 11 acts that were to have taken part in the Garrance Reggae Festival on Saturday. Of eight concerts Sizzla was to have given in France, six have been canceled. Last fall, his British tour was canceled after complaints about his lyrics, and in February he was jailed in his native Jamaica for cursing onstage.    Corcoran Gallery Cuts Days       The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington announced yesterday that beginning tomorrow, it would be open five days a week instead of six and would raise its admission price. The museum acted little more than a month after its president and director, David C. Levy, resigned under pressure from board members who said that faltering fundraising for a $170 million addition, designed by Frank Gehry, was diverting resources from other priorities. According to its announcement, the museum will be closed on Mondays. Already closed on Tuesdays, it will be open Wednesdays through Sundays, except for holiday Mondays, including July 4. Ticket prices will rise to $8 from $6.75, although a two-for-the-price-of-one rate will be in effect July and August.    Where Art Imitates History       The Tower of London will make more history by playing host for the first time to a Festival of Music, from Wednesday through July 16, alternating five nights of grand opera with six nights of jazz. The opening attraction is Donizetti's ''Anna Bolena,'' whose second act is set at the Tower, where Ann Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII, was held and executed in 1536.  Another first will take place on July 15, when the opening night of the annual Proms concerts in Royal Albert Hall in London will be shown live on a huge screen in Trafalgar Square, the BBC reported. The concert will be preceded by free music performances in the square. The concert theme is the sea.

It's a contemporary ensemble that's usually mild-mannered enough to serve atmospheric purposes during a candlelit dinner, but it's also a working band, with all the depth and shared intuition that phrase implies. Mr. Haden, above, a bassist who first made a name for himself playing with Ornette Coleman, formed Quartet West 20 years ago. It has been one of his trademark ensembles, though its last proper album was in the 1990's. And aside from an early drummer substitution -- Billy Higgins played on the group's first Verve album and was succeeded by Larance Marable -- the lineup has been steadfast. The heart of the group is Ernie Watts, with his ardent and self-assured tenor saxophone style","excerpt":"the soul is Mr. Haden. Alan Broadbent, with his sophisticated piano playing and arranging, could be considered the brain. Altogether the ensemble has always peered through the haze of memory at a distant, somewhat airbrushed past; one album included sampled vocals by Billie Holiday and Jo Stafford, and another featured on its cover the Alfred Eisenstadt photograph of a sailor's kiss on V-J Day. Yet the band's sound has never really been a throwback, thanks in large part to Mr. Watts. As with Mr. Haden's recent re-engagement with Cuban melancholy and political protest, his way with romance is artful but seemingly ingenuous, and never less than sincere.

Fox) has been adopted by a loving and well-to-do human family. He sees the park in all its moods: the action highlight is his hard-won victory in the toy-boat race in the park's Conservatory Water (better known as the Model Boat Pond), and at another point, when Stuart is lost in the park at night, the place feels very menacing. Tonight ''Stuart Little'' will be shown under the stars in a setting that's far from menacing, as part of the fourth annual Central Park Film Festival, which features films featuring the park. The festival ends tomorrow night with Sydney Pollack's watercolor-memories romance ''The Way We Were'' (1973). The film, selected through voting on the park's Web site, is a slightly strange choice given that most of the outdoor scenes are set in Southern California.

It is a didactic assault upon the irresponsible stunting of aerial hooligans, rather than a dramatically stirring photoplay. Coming so quickly after the tragic crash of the Maxim Gorky, it does possess a certain topical excitement. But chiefly it celebrates the austere virtues of military discipline, which have already had their share of attention in \\"Devil Dogs of the Air\\" and \\"West Point of the Air.\\" \\"Men on Wings\\" suffers, among other things, from the great bourgeois malady of story trouble, and its aerial photography is not within miles of the brilliant flying scenes that may be found even in the mediocre Hollywood melodramas of the air.Although it is the chief function of the film to emphasize the need for iron discipline in the development of the Red Army, it contains several elements which the U. S. S. R. usually excludes from its pictures. For one thing, it subscribes to that most decadent of the capitalist entertainment conventions, the comedy relief. Sex, too, plays an unexpected part. The beautiful lady pilot, you see, is in love with, the flier whose daredevil stunting causes him to be grounded by the authorities. If this were a bourgeois drama, it would be reasonably safe to guess that the flier would regain both his fame and his girl by some spectacular bit of heroism. But the Russians apparently are not convinced that passion is as steadfast an emotion as Hollywood has taught us to expect. Thus the heroine, instead of clinging nobly to her man while he is in disgrace, decides in favor of the middle-aged commandant of the airport, whom she has previously regarded merely as a good friend.Even inferior Russian films have a habit of being acted with skill and conviction, and \\"Men on Wings\\" hews to the tradition. E. K. Melnikova, besides having abilities as an actress, is a comely young woman who resembles Elisabeth Bergner in some of her moods. A. P. Chistyakov provides several rousing comic moments as the elderly mechanic who regrets that he has been saved from a drunkard's grave.

At a negotiation session on Thursday sponsored by the United States, the Soviet Union and Portugal, the warring sides agreed to set a date for free elections and then sign a cease-fire agreement, Mr. Savimbi told reporters.   The breakthrough in the tortuous peace efforts follows a series of meetings here this week, including a session between Mr. Savimbi and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union. Mr. Savimbi, who had been vilified by the Kremlin as an anti-Communist menace, also met with President Bush on Thursday. Pressure From U.S. and Moscow     Washington and Moscow have been pressing their allies in Angola to halt the fighting, which has killed more than 300,000 people and left the mineral-rich country in ruin.   The United States has shipped Mr. Savimbi's group, known as Unita, as much as $50 million in weapons each year since 1986","excerpt":"the Soviets have given the Angolan Government as much as $800 million annually, United States officials say.   Under the tentative accord, both countries will stop sending weapons once a cease-fire is signed, American officials said.   Mr. Savimbi said that Unita and the second-ranking official in Angola's governing party, Lopo do Nascimento, had agreed at the highest-level gathering on Thursday that the signing of a cease-fire agreement should be preceded by the setting of a date for free elections.   The two sides agreed that the cease-fire should be guaranteed by international observers, he said, and that outside military assistance would stop once the cease-fire accord was signed.   Mr. Savimbi said there was also agreement that Angola should be governed through a democratic system and that elections should be monitored by international observers. 'No Question' of an Accord     The Angolan Government official, Mr. do Nascimiento, asked for more time to confer with his superiors in Luanda, Mr. Savimbi said. But \\"there is no question\\" that the Government will agree in principle, he added.   At a news conference late Thursday, the American, Soviet and Portuguese participants in the talks said \\"significant progress\\" had been made but declined to elaborate.   A United States official, speaking on condition of anonymity, today confirmed the gist of Mr. Savimbi's account of the meeting.   \\"Unita is optimistic that the remaining differences between the two parties can be successfully addressed and that signature of a cease-fire will be possible during the sixth round of negotiations,\\" the official said.

The so-called \\"big idea\\" works out well enough in motion-picture theory, but it would probably meet with no little ridicule in the ordinary course of human events. Mr. Skinner nevertheless finds that his brain-wave goes along without the least friction, but the action of this story does not impress one with the young man's genius.In this tepid effort there are a few mildly amusing periods, but there is nothing particularly original in the direction or the narrative. It is a case of an idea being overwhelmingly successful, and the director, Lynn Shores, has not seen fit to include much in the way of conflict.Mr. Skinner, at the opening of the story, is appointed a partner in his firm, and the senior members suggest that Mr. Skinner ought to get rid of the three elderly gentlemen who have been, faithful and loyal to the concern for many years. Mr. Skinner has a soft place in his heart for these old fellows, and he decides to try out his idea, which is to employ an attractive girl in the office. Jack McLaughlin, the son of the senior partner, happens to be in love with an actress, and it is this girl whom Skinner employs to stimulate and invigorate the office force. This Dorothy, a stranger to business offices, apparently is a clever girl, for she soon understands the work, and through her charming appearance and vivacity the old employes begin to carry out their alloted tasks with unusual enthusiasm. The bald-headed man elects to wear a wig, and the others become greatly interested in their personal appearance. They even take up golf, and it is through this that they are able to obtain the order that saves the firm from ruin. And they do this after young McLaughlin has tried out his ideas as a go-getter salesman.Martha Sleeper is attractive as Dorothy. Bryant Washburn is rather dull as Skinner.\\"His Majesty Dozes.\\"At the Greenwich Village Theatre, where Dr. Paul Fejos's picture, \\"The Last Moment,\\" is still on exhibition, Marion Green, the baritone, is appearing in quite a charming musical sketch known as \\"His Majesty Dozes.\\" It was written by Hunter Williams, and Friml, Romberg and Bennett are responsible for the music.

But the Reagan philosophy may violate the Spencer creed in one important respect: its heavy stress on the buildup of military power. Spencer, with his libertarian philosophy, saw the growth of both military and civilian powers of the state as threats to a free society based on ethical principles and competitive markets.   Spencer recognized that warlike neighbors justified the maintenance of military forces, to be sure, but he hoped that they would be used only for defensive purposes. Economic Scene","excerpt":"The Spencer Prophecies"},{"year":"1993","title":"The disciples of John Maynard Keynes have long been urging President-elect Bill Clinton to adopt a policy of benign neglect toward the Federal deficit. The national debt, they say, was far bigger relative to the economy during the early years of the the postwar economic boom than it is today. So, this thinking goes, the mounting debt should not keep the new Administration from spending its way to a more robust economic recovery or bankrolling more public investment.   But a powerful new tool for analyzing how tax burdens are spread across different generations -- called generational accounting -- shows that this sanguine view is shortsighted at best.

As Congress reconvenes this month to examine such issues as national security, global reach, cost-benefit analysis and other broad strategic concerns, the outcome often hinges on the tactics, strategy and persuasiveness of defense industry promoters.   The ability to convince and cajole elected officials and defense experts on these questions and on the ultimate selection of weapon systems has very specific consequences for particular communities and corporations, particularly those on Long Island.

Children's Harvest Fair  Brooklyn Botanic Garden 1000 Washington Avenue Crown Heights (718) 622-4433 Recommended for all ages Tomorrow    One of the least painful ways to say adios to summer is to reap its bounty, by picking herbs, flowers and vegetables. After all, dahlias are just blooming, basil is still tinging gardens with its smell, and overabundant zucchinis are being thrown to the woodchucks. At this harvest fair, however, every summer artifact is being put to full use. Children who worked in the Children's Garden all summer will be selling herb vinegars, homemade pickles and pressed-flower notecards. Bunches of dried flowers and wreaths (baby's breath, statice, gomphrena), as well as fresh mint, parsley and chives, will also be sold at low prices.  For children, there will be face painting, seed-collage making, flower arranging and cooking demonstrations for things like pesto (you have to wash a lot of basil leaves), couscous with vegetables, and stir-fried leeks. Before and after the cooking demonstrations will be a bean-bag toss, a doughnut-eating contest, bobbing for apples and an obstacle course for the wiry-legged. Edifying displays on how gardens grow will send children back to school brimming with horticultural facts. And there will be a gaggle of award-winning sunflowers. Admittance to the fair, which is from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M., is free, though some activities are 25 to 50 cents. If it's raining, the fair will be moved indoors.  'King Theo'  Wings Theater Company Archive Building 154 Christopher Street Manhattan (212) 627-2961 Recommended ages: 4 to 8 Through Sept. 22    \\"King Theo\\" is an original play by Cynthia MacGregor, a Floridian. Its daft and wry humor -- at one point the king wears unstylishly short, bell-bottomed red polyester pants -- is an appropriate counterpoint to the theater's sophisticated ambiance. The velvet wine-colored seats make youngsters feel royal and respected, especially since many children's theater companies have awkward and uncomfortable bleachers, benches or floor mats. As for the play, King Theo is a bit bonkers, though everyone likes him anyway, not just because he's the king but also because he likes jokes. He needs to hire a court jester, and the candidate has to be a master jokester. After interviewing 387 people, King Theo Rooly Rollicker Pollicker Bumblebee Schnitzel IV is about to give up. Then Josie, a girl whose malapropisms make the king guffaw, shows up not seeking a job but happy to have one nevertheless. The king, played by Peter K. Hirsch, and Lady Larkspur, played by Kimberly Topper, are dashingly snooty and absurd. And Lady Larkspur, who talks like Zsa Zsa Gabor, eventually gets her comeuppance, which pleases the king indeed. The 35-minute play has no intermission and ends so abruptly that you have to pay close attention. The theater, in the newly renovated and immaculate Archive Building, is down a flight of stairs. Tickets are $5; performances are Saturdays and Sundays at 1 P.M.  'The Movies: Fantasies'    152 Wooster Street Ground Floor, North Space SoHo Recommended ages: 4 and up Through Sunday    In 1985, Joyce Kozloff, a SoHo artist, was commissioned to create an artwork for the Los Angeles Metro's Seventh and Flower Streets underground station, which is opening this month. The first phase of Ms. Kozloff's work, a hand-painted tile frieze, is about to be shipped to the West Coast. New Yorkers have the chance to view this 110-foot-long \\"unfolding film strip\\" in a gallery space at 152 Wooster Street for the next few days. What a film strip it is, too, with what seems like every character and image ever created for Hollywood's silent and contemporary science-fiction movies wrapped around the gallery's walls. For children, there are plenty of faces, bodies and objects that they'll be charmed to see. For example, the first group of tiles (they are categorized) is centered on flying creatures. Next are sea monsters, giant reptiles -- Godzillas with gaping, teeth-rimmed mouths -- creatures with big brains (E.T., the Alien), apes, werewolves, strange plants and insects, ghosts and spooks, robots, famous figures (Tin Man and Frankenstein) and spaceships. Even though the tiles are hanging at adult eye-level, young children (who might have to be picked up) and older ones will probably insist on lingering at each tile, just to see if they can identify the creature. Only some of the lifelike images are ominous -- Cyclops's eye seems so unforgiving -- but there are also the Cowardly Lion, harmless robots and friendly human faces from \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" Even the werewolves don't seem too voracious -- they don't move or speak; they're more like pages from a vivid children's book. Which is how some children might prefer them: seen but not heard. The gallery is open daily from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission is free.

And out of it spilled such a rummage of cinematic gee-gaws and antiques that it is certain to fascinate those persons who delight in pawing over gaudy junk.For the Warners have taken the novel which Edna Ferber wrote—a novel of high romantic polish and maddening emptiness underneath—and have given it visualization in the grand, flashy, empty Hollywood style. They have taken Miss Ferber's period story of a beautiful Creole girl, of a long, lanky con man from Texas and of their traffic with high-society swells and have made it appear just precisely the fictitious romance that it is. Indeed, they have decked out their fable with so many familiar film festoons that one cannot seriously regard it as anything but a manufactured show.As such, it has all the business","excerpt":"the spirited Creole girl who is the illegitimate daughter of a nabob of New Orleans; the slow, stylish Texan who manages to make a comfortable living with the cards and who falls for the lovely adventuress like a ton of those well-known gold bricks; the rich, suave, aristocratic bachelor whom the lady snags at Saratoga Springs; a fight between gangs for a railroad and the inevitable romantic, happy end. It also has plenty of plush-ness in the splendor of its décor and a studiedly ostentatious and insistent musical score.But it lacks a logical pattern of drama and character—and that the competent playing of Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper cannot supply. The money-mad Creole lady whom Miss Bergman elegantly plays is a stereotyped screen adventuress with a dozen antecedents one could name, and Mr. Cooper's Texas gambler is a familiarly mechanical picaroon. Unfortunately, most of the action takes place between these two and is played to such tedious extremities that the interest there is in it is dulled. The fine opportunity to image the President Grant period is mostly spent in these long-drawn scenes between the principals. And that railroad feud is just a fight dragged in.Miss Bergman gives ample surface evidence of a coquettish, impulsive miss and looks quite fetching with dark hair and eyebrows, but there is no genuine spirit in her act. It is hard to accept this proper lady as the willful courtesan she's supposed to be. And Mr. Cooper, while pleasantly roguish, has an air of substantial piety. There are certain bizarre extravagancies suggested in the retinue of a dwarf (Jerry Austin) and a dour mulatto (Flora Robson) which follows Miss Bergman through the film. But, except for the visual eccentricity, the two are put to little use and their variously monotonous performances become rather painful toward the end. Curt Bois, Florence Bates and John Warburton do well enough in minor roles, \\"Saratoga Trunk,\\" however, is a piece of baggage labeled solely for its two stars.

Like Tina Turner, the American singer with whom she has frequently been compared, she projects an indomitable vitality along with a metallic sexiness that is friendly and playful in its exaggeration.    Vocally, there is nothing subtle about Miss Soares. She has a large, raw-textured voice that at Tuesday's opening night show she frequently pushed into the gravelly, gargling timbres associated with Louis Armstrong. The projection of growling, wild-animal ferocity was one of several percussive tricks the singer employed in a set whose more familiar material included songs from the film \\"Black Orpheus,\\" Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"Dindi,\\" and a phonetically enunciated English-language rendition of Nat (King) Cole's version of \\"Unforgettable.\\" Review/Music","excerpt":"The Spirited Elza Soares, a Legend of Brazil"},{"year":"1976","title":"There will be ghosts hovering over the St. James Theater on Thursday night&#8212","excerpt":"the spirits of performances past.

The issue that both divides and frames current photographic thinking is not (blessed relief) whether photography can be considered an art, but what kind of an art it is. Is it an art like painting or drawing, with the same esthetic claims and standards, or is it an art form unto itself, so inextricably interconnected with social and political values that to call it ''art'' in the conventional sense requires quotation marks?   The lines are drawn between those who think of photography as a relatively new and largely virgin branch of art history, and those who rebel at the very notion of photography being ''estheticized.'' The former welcome the medium's elevation to the realm of the museum, the marketplace and traditional art-historical scholarship, while the latter argue that photography's ''museumization'' (Hilton Kramer's neologism of a few years back) robs it of its real importance - that is, its social meanings.

It includes, in modest glimpses, several kinds of blues and jazz, calypso, circus music and old-time mountain music, and a semirural, basically unnameable Stephen Foster-meets-free-jazz feeling. She has a fuller band here than on her earlier records, a septet that includes Bill Frisell on guitar. But complex as the mixtures may be, processing this music is not hard. Everything reduces to her own sound, which is hard to dislike: it is slow, patient, full and pulsating, and she puts all her trust into whatever melody she's playing.    Michael Blake       Free jazz has a tradition nearly a half-century long. Sometimes its enthusiasts will mention this, to remind you that it is to be taken seriously, and they're right. But its tradition also becomes its vicious cycle","excerpt":"the spontaneity inherent in the whole idea can be lost when the sound is codified. Here is one instance of the cycle being broken. Michael Blake is a New York-based saxophonist, once a member of the Lounge Lizards, and ''Right Before Your Very Ears'' (Clean Feed) is the forthright, off-the-cuff new album by his trio, with the bassist Ben Allison and the drummer Jeff Ballard. Some of it is completely free, some dependent on small written motifs; there's also a cover of Duke Ellington's lovely ''Mount Harissa.'' It is rhythmic and nuanced work by a modern mainstream jazz musician playing free jazz as a choice; you can hear Archie Shepp and Lucky Thompson and Coltrane and Dewey Redman in Mr. Blake, and the group sounds great while playing what it wants to. (It is available at cleanfeed-records.com.)    Ryan Adams       Ryan Adams is a songwriter on the move, and he can be suspiciously ingratiating; he shows his audience everything he knows, whether it's country or postpunk or the Grateful Dead, in geysers of new songs. Though ''Cold Roses,'' a double album from earlier this year, skipped around a bit too much, the new ''Jacksonville City Nights'' (Lost Highway) is the most concentrated Ryan Adams record in five years, since ''Heartbreaker.'' Alternative country, when it got its momentum a decade ago, was a tortured medium, full of unacknowledged posturing and the one-upmanship of reverse cool, and Mr. Adams was first known -- sometimes to his displeasure -- as a leader of that movement. But it's good to hear him take another solid crack at it, with more accumulated wisdom. His thing is getting himself in cages and then rattling them; with a studiously shambolic sound and a hard-punching, sometimes overwrought vocal delivery, he wants to show that this is no ordinary country record -- even no ordinary alternative-country record. But he has a strong ear for a beautiful hook in a sad song: ''Dear John,'' a desolate duet with Norah Jones, is one of the best things either singer has recorded.    Dean Miller       Speaking of alternative country, Dean Miller could have gone down that road 10 years ago, but didn't. The son of the songwriter Roger Miller, an upper-tier deity in Nashville, he made one album for Capitol in 1997, full of rock dynamics, hard-core country touches and smart lyrics, and then disappeared. He is now back with ''Platinum'' (Koch Nashville), which basically picks up where he left off, with a booming, aggressive sound and plenty of country historicity. For anyone curious about why he hasn't been heard from in eight years, there are clues in his honky-tonk waltz ''Music Executive,'' written from the perspective of one of the people who probably didn't help him the first time around: ''I can't carry a tune in a roomful of buckets, but I've learned to judge like a pro/I'm the Siskel and Ebert of Haggard and Jones, and I make up the things I don't know.''    Sara Evans       Sara Evans is no underdog; she was the female singer you were most likely to hear on the radio last year. Her fifth album, ''Real Fine Place'' (RCA), contains the No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot Country chart, ''A Real Fine Place to Start,'' a hard-to-resist track with loud, multilayered vocals in the chorus. The rest of the album exhibits her increasingly complex persona; there are lyrics about celebrating rural traditions as well as escaping them, with music exactly halfway between country and mainstream pop. One song, ''Supernatural,'' carefully describes a parent's feeling of invincibility when faced with having to protect her child, without going too far into sentimentality; another, ''Bible Song,'' written by Lori McKenna, includes this startling chorus:       They marry young in these parts.     They work the factories     So I ran as fast as I could,     Through the tall grass and midnight woods,     So nobody would sing some Bible song after me.

Moreover, his dialogue sequences reek with bromidic sentiment, and his actions are heavy, as are those of Robert Ellis, who impersonates Zelli, an archvillain if there ever was one.The story, naïve as a boxer's outlook, concerns a young man who has lived an exemplary life until just before the big fight, when he is \\"framed.\\" After being berated by his father, he casts aside the woman who compromised him, and wins the fight.Aileen Pringle takes the rôle of the siren.

And on Thursday, June 30, 1983, on a busy commercial street in Paris, Bernard Boursicot -- an attache in the French Foreign Service who has always dreamed of being a man of distinction -- is hearing that alarm in his head.   It is odd. Usually Boursicot returns to Paris after being posted abroad the way a hungry man sits down at the table. Old friends, good food, all-night bars, the possibility of a brief and amusing love affair -- he approaches it all with cheerful greed.

Butterfly","excerpt":"The Spy Who Fell in Love With a Shadow"},{"year":"1925","title":"At the Rivoli this week is a picture entitled \\"New Lives for Old,\\" which is a good entertainment, even if it does stray ludicrously beyond all bounds of possibility. It deals with espionage and contre-espionage in France during the war. The heroine is a popular dancer, known as Olympe, who, through her oath to her country, is forced to bury her identity and pass herself off as a girl who only resembles the dancer. It is quite a good idea, but would be improved if the work in the military spy system were not so obvious, and if the writer had been more familiar with the subject.Betty Compson portrays the successful woman spy, who uncovers the culprit in the sacred precincts of the Ministry of War. Miss Compson is attractive and clever in her impersonation. She is agile, quick tempered, but in character is not gifted with powers of observation, although her cunning is well brought out.One of the effective stretches in this photoplay is where Olympe calls upon everybody in a café to arise and drink a toast to France. This follows the playing of the Marseillaise, which is well rendered by the Rivoli orchestra and is stirring at this period of the picture. One man in a corner remains seated. True, the audience notices that he makes an effort to rise, but Olympe fixes him with an angry stare, and then cries out: \\"I said everybody stand and drink a toast to France.\\"The charming dancer then threads her way through the tables and dashes a glass of wine in the man's face. Eventually she sees him receive a crutch from a waiter, and then realizes that he has only one leg. Olympe apologizes and through this officer in citizen's clothes she is employed at the Ministry of War.Olympe, prior to this, had encountered Hugh Warren, an American Army Captain, with whom she falls in love. He does not know that she is Olympe, the famous dancer, and therefore this gives her a chance later to deny her identity.Theodore Kosloff figures as De Montinbard, the clever spy. Mr. Kosloff is capable in his rôle, although his weird whiskers are hardly suited to the part. He tricks Olympe by writing something in ink and stamping it with a blotter. He sees her put the blotter before the mirror and notices her surprise on reading words to the effect that she must not take him for a fool. Olympe, not to be outdone, insists that she was merely trying to find out whether he was writing to some other girl.This production is beautifully staged and decidedly well photographed, with costumes and uniforms that are made the most of by excellent lighting effects. Considering the subject with which it deals it is rather frivolous, but none the less entertaining. Had the idea been taken more seriously with a comprehension of contre-espionage work, it could have been made a far more stirring effort.Wallace MacDonald is rather stiff and self-conscious as the American Captain, and some of the other players are not particularly impressive in their respective impersonations.THEATRICAL NOTES.\\"In the South Seas,\\" a play by John B.

THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Spy's Nemesis."},{"year":"1994","title":"COMPANIES Is Ford a Monarchy or Not? (Check Back in a Few Years)  \\"There are no crown princes,\\" Henry Ford 2d once said. Hmmmmm. Was it pure coincidence, or pure merit, that put the founder's grandson on top for a generation? Or, in true kingly fashion, was he exempting himself but saying family ties would carry no weight in the next generation? So it's been for over a decade, with commoners running the show after 75 years of monarchy. The catch is, the princes and their cousins own the place, or enough of it to call the shots. So everyone's been scanning the family tree for the one true heir. Two possibilities: Edsel 2d and William Jr. Both became directors in 1988, creating an instant horse race. It was neck-and-neck until last week, when William Jr., 37, was named to head the powerful finance committee. Is all now crystal clear? One observer called it \\"excellent preparatory ground for his becoming chairman,\\" while others thought Ford's managers were merely appeasing the family.  American Express, Off Its Perch  As revolving credit rolled across the land, American Express, with its high annual fees and schoolmarmish insistence on paying off balances every month, started falling behind. The public wanted credit, not cachet. So last week American Express got off its perch and offered its first card with no annual fee. What's more, the Optima True Grace Card -- no, salvation is not included -- offers a \\"true\\" grace period before the interest monster starts chewing, rather than having interest start on the day of purchase for those who keep a balance. It had to have some gimmick.  Ozzie and Harriet They Aren't  One wonders what the Haft family dinner table was like in happier days. Were there battles over who sat at the head, who got the biggest piece of pie? If so, that past was small-potatoes prelude","excerpt":"the squabbles get bigger by the day. Let's see: when last we tuned in to this executive-suite soap opera, Herbert Haft had fired a son and a wife and installed another son, Ronald, as Dart Group's president. But now Ronald, in an effort to oust his father as chairman, exercised options to increase his voting power to 44 percent. To get control, though, he'll need other family members' support; remembering the past, they may just nibble their own pie. In a truce last week, Dart decided a group of outside directors would run things for a while, and stockholders liked that idea fine. Just look below. Inching Away From Bhopal  For a decade now, the names Bhopal and Union Carbide have been stuck together with the glue of nightmare. A gas leak from a Carbide pesticide plant in 1984 killed 4,000 and caused lingering health problems for thousands of others, making it the worst industrial accident in history, so that glue will hold in memory for decades more. But now at least the business bonds have been severed. Last week Carbide sold its stake in the plant to a Calcutta company, with the $90 million in proceeds set aside for thousands of victims and survivors. More than $20 million will go for a 500-bed hospital to be built in Bhopal. Barbarians at Old Gates  The 90's must be sadly short of takeover battlegrounds, because two of the biggest dealmakers of the age are now forced to refight a battle from the glorious 80's. Kohlberg, Kravis, led by Henry Kravis, bought a Florida company called Walter Industries in 1987 with the investment-banking help of Leon Black. But things soon got messy: after Walter was forced into bankruptcy, Mr. Black -- now calling himself an empire builder in the Warren Buffett mold -- started buying its debt. But Kohlberg, Kravis now says Mr. Black is using confidential information to help him grab the company, and last week it filed suit to try to stop him.  THE ECONOMY Car Buyers: Yes, Still There  Car buyers didn't disappear, they just took July off -- mainly because the cars weren't there. After July's weak sales, car makers blamed low inventories, while others sniffed cooling economic winds. But Detroit was right: in August the cars were back in showrooms -- and buyers showed up. Figures out last week showed a 10.3 percent rise from the previous August. The auto industry is counting on more of the same; a quarter of the vehicles on the road are at least a decade old, and enough is fast becoming enough. What's That? Inflation? The statistics gods must have decided that things were getting too quiet, that people were getting too blase about inflation. For last week, out of the blue, came word that producer prices took a 0.6 percent leap in August, the biggest monthly rise in nearly four years. Yes, one month's data mean nothing; no, rising producer prices don't automatically mean higher overall inflation. But the markets have to react to something, so stock and bond prices plunged on the news. So if inflation does in fact appear, does that mean the Fed rate increases have failed? Not really, for economists say it takes six months or so for rate tinkering to make itself felt. Is the Fed's Voice Cracking?  We hear it all the time: the Fed does this, the Fed's about to do that. And the image that comes to mind is either of Alan Greenspan, the chairman, or of a monolithic body, acting in resounding unity. It ain't necessarily so. Alan Blinder, the vice chairman, made some remarks recently that suggested that Fed interest-rate policy was not all sweetness and harmony -- that he might be a bit less willing to raise rates when unemployment is high. This naturally caused an uproar, because when the Fed mops its brow, a million fans go on. So last week, Mr. Blinder rushed back into line, denying any policy differences. One moral, he said: \\"If you are on a central bank board, you ought to keep your mouth shut.\\" Health Care: No Band-Aids  If a dike has two holes, it does no good to fix just one. That was the argument used by Representative Jim McDermott last week as he urged Congress to do nothing on health care this year, saying a piecemeal approach would make things worse. Uninsured patients are \\"the leak in the dike,\\" he said. \\"Either you fix the dike or you face the flood. And without universal coverage, the flood is uncontrollable health care costs.\\" His is a potent voice on the issue, for Mr. McDermott had gathered wide support for his own plan, a sweeping \\"single payer\\" system -- Government pays the bills.  INTERNATIONAL  Statistics Don't Lie, People Do  Finally, someone said it. Ever since the first economic statistics bubbled forth from that primordial computer, politicians have twisted them, put bows in their hair, buried them or shouted them -- always making the facts fit their fancy. But Brazil's Finance Minister, Rubens Ricupero, recently spoke a rare, glorious truth when he said of economic data: \\"What is good, we take advantage of. What is bad, we hide.\\" And though it was all too redundant: \\"I have no scruples.\\" An uncontrollable urge to come clean, a yearning for a new era of honesty? Hardly. After a TV interview, he thought the cameras were off. They weren't. Brazil has a new Finance Minister.  Bank of Cards in Mexico  Things have been hopping in Mexico since Nafta, and Carlos Cabal Paniche was in the thick of it, creating the nation's No. 4 bank and making deals to buy big American food companies. But the bubble burst last week: the Government took control of the bank, a warrant was issued for Mr. Cabal's arrest on charges that he fraudulently lent himself up to $700 million, and Mr. Cabal was nowhere in sight. Now, as one Mexican consultant put it, \\"A lot more questions are going to be asked\\" about cross-border deals. What Is a Car Anyway?  Surely the oddest skirmishing in the auto wars with Japan is the endless bickering over whether those odd hybrids that make suburbanites feel as if they're on safari -- \\"sport-utility vehicles\\" -- are meant for people or cargo. They didn't become such hot sellers by hauling hay, but Customs still slapped a 25 percent \\"cargo vehicle\\" tariff on two-door imports (vs. 2.5 percent for cars). Last week, though, a Federal court ruled that a two-door Nissan Pathfinder was wrongly classified as a cargo vehicle. So, Ford Explorer and your rugged friends, watch out: you may not have a lock on this market for long.

Locally, the Cantonese bias is entrenched in our ethnic eating impulse, and masters of other exotic fare inevitably tailor their specialties to appeal. Instead of opening Vietnamese restaurants, for instance, many cooks from Vietnam have opened little soup kitchens, like Bo Ky at 80 Bayard Street, that serve big bowls of Vietnamese noodle soups. But when pressed, the cooks claim that the soups are of Chinese soo chow inspiration.   Likewise, Thai restaurants around town almost always offer chopsticks (a Chinese, not Thai, eating implement) and use Cantonese-style sauces in the stir-fried creations from their woks.   I've only found three Thai restaurants that are more Bangkok than Hong Kong, and a full meal is usually less than $15.     Siam Grill is a small, dark storefront in midtown where the cooking is much better than it ought to be this close to Broadway and Off Broadway theaters. The soups are all made from real chicken, duck or fish stock.   The best dishes are the warm beef salad","excerpt":"the squid with chili peppers, onions and basil; the deep-fried fish with ginger sauce, and the stir-fried vegetables with a coconut milk sauce that is spiked with red curry.   (Siam Grill, 586 Ninth Avenue, between 42d and 43d Streets; 212-307-1363.)      On the East Side, Bangkok Lodge is a more sophisticated Thai haven. It's a slightly fancier storefront and not all the food is perfect: the baby-finger-sized Thai spring rolls are a little greasy, and so are the honey-dipped chicken wings. None of the fried rice or noodle dishes further the cause of discreet Thai tastes.   But the fresh frog's legs are superb pan-fried with garlic and white pepper, the steamed whole fish with mushroom and ginger is good, and so is the sweet and sour pork with minced fresh cucumber, onion, tomato and scallion. The house curry is strong and is smoothed by coconut milk and tossed with sliced beef or chicken.   On a good night, the Bangkok Lodge's tamarind duck -- a whole hacked duck that is deep fried and glazed with a tart tamarind sauce -- could draw a mass exodus from Chinatown.   (Bangkok Lodge, 1069 First Avenue, at 58th Street, 212-752-9277.)     The exiting droves would be well-advised to continue across the East River and on to Astoria, Queens, to Ubol's Kitchen, home of the cleanest-tasting, and most unusual Thai cooking I've had in the city.   The restaurant, which originally opened four years ago in a Queens bar, moved last summer to more cheerful quarters on Steinway Street. And, in the process, it has managed to preserve its energetic kitchen while taming and refining its dining room.   Of the appetizers, greasy, deep-fried crab-meat balls are the only losers. Pork satay is smoky, the accompanying peanut sauce smooth and rich with a mean, chili-pepper punch; tiny spring rolls are addictive, as are the deep-fried chicken and potato curry puff.   The beef, the squid and the shrimp salads, as well as the spicy sausage salad, are sensational.   Of the main courses I tasted, only the chicken Masaman, the jungle curry, the pot roast and the Pad Thai were ordinary.   The duck soup with preserved lime, the crisp-skinned barbecued chicken, chicken with peanut sauce, squid with lime and chilies, frog's legs with garlic and white pepper, eggplant with chilies and yellow pepper sauce, vegetables steamed with coconut milk, and shrimp roasted in a clay pot with tofu, lemon grass, coriander, chilies and bean thread will have me running back for more.

PLACES/EVERYONE By Jim Daniels. 80 pp. Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press. Cloth, $12.50. Paper, $7.95. IN ''The Flying Change,'' which has just been given the Pulitzer Prize for poetry, Henry Taylor writes the poems of a country squire. Most of the time this country life is all too settled, predictable and complacent","excerpt":"the squire, after all, enjoys all the pleasures of a farmer's life with none of the risks. Indeed, the gentleman farmer may pursue pleasures for which the real farmer has neither time nor inclination, as in ''Evening at Wolf Trap'': Once, outside the theater's weathering walls, we sat on the grass with wine and cheese, French bread and fruit; and as we ate, our talk was sometimes interrupted by a small crowd farther down the hill, throwing a frisbee.   Happily, Mr. Taylor is aware of the danger of such inherently unintense, unpoetic material to his work, and that is why he calls his book ''The Flying Change.'' In the title poem he explains that this equestrian term refers to the changing of a horse's lead in mid-jump; as poet, it is his desire to ''hold myself immobile in bright air, / sustained in time astride the flying change.''
