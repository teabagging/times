The New York City Ballet presented three bright and warmhearted works by George Balanchine, chasing the winter blues away.         \\"Chaconne\\" begins as a dream of love. The lovers awake not to some grim reality but to an elegant festivity at what might very well be the court of a monarch known to his subjects as a Sun King.    DANCE REVIEW","excerpt":"3 Works by Balanchine To Chase Winter's Blues"},{"year":"1994","title":"Bebe Miller may be the most invigoratingly irritating modern dance choreographer at work in New York today. Ms. Miller seemed to be interested in re-creating thought processes and fragments on stage in the three world premieres presented by her company on Wednesday at the Joyce Theater as part of the theater's Altogether Different festival. Hermetic and discontinuous, the dances were not the most welcoming of artistic efforts. But they are hard to dismiss or to forget.   In the first piece, \\"Heaven and Earth,\\" Ms. Miller resembled a rapt worshiper caught up in a private vision of the Lord. A kind of meditative speaking-in-tongues for the whole body, the solo gained much from its set, Caroline Beasley-Baker's high free-standing portal and curtain in rich tones of purple and black. Ellen Fullman contributed an excruciating buzz saw drone of an electronic score, laced with slivers of religious music by Clarence Fountain and the Five Blind Boys. Ms. Miller's fatigues, the color and texture of a dried leaf, were the intriguing work of the costume designer Yafemi.

He did not, as his early detractors insisted, merely visualize musical structure onstage with patterns or dancers. Balanchine's genius lay elsewhere: in commenting on the music as he explored it, to reveal aspects that others would not have imagined. The give and take between composer and choreographer explains the subliminal tension between music and dance in Balanchine's ballets.

''It made people give greater weight and credence to the view that the economy will slow further in the first half of next year.''   A slower economic expansion leads many analysts to expect that interest rates will fall as credit demands remain slack and the Fed tries to stimulate the economy with an easier monetary policy.  Other analysts were less confident than Mr. Bench that rates would continue to fall.
