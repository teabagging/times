The area was once known for the great camps elaborate log cabins built by the Gilded Age elite. Joe Barile, an Olympic luger and local developer, wanted the Whiteface Lodge (which he designed and built) to evoke that eras rustic splendor. The lodges 85 suites are available for full and partial ownership (a one-sixth deed starts at $148,000). The nightly resort rates, beginning at about $360 plus tax, arent cheap either, but the hotel has a lot to offer.    THE LOCATION  The lodge is near the center of town. From my room, at the corner of the building closest to the street, I could see and hear traffic at a distance (and this was in summer, with leaves on the trees). Even more surprising, the hotel isnt on Lake Placid. It does offer a narrow strip of beachfront, about a mile away and reached by shuttle. Luckily, the ride is a pleasure, both because the vehicle is a Mercedes-Benz GL 450 and because the drivers, like most of the staff, couldnt be nicer.    THE BUILDING  The interiors, where towering timbers are used as columns, and virtually every surface is covered in wood or bark, are stunning. You cant help wondering if theres a single tree left in the Adirondacks after seeing the number of logs used in the structure though most of them, according to Mr. Barile, came from the hotel site.    THE ROOM  My room, dubbed a one-bedroom superior suite, was rectangular, with the bed at one end (opening onto a lovely terrace) and the kitchen at the other. I would have preferred some kind of room divider at $400 a night, who wants to look at the refrigerator and dishwasher? (More expensive suites have separate kitchens.) The bathroom, containing a washer and dryer in a closet, was luxurious, and just as beautifully detailed, with lots of wood, as every other part of the hotel.    THE GROUNDS  There are far more flowerbeds and fountains and hanging lanterns than a place for communing with nature ought to have.    AMENITIES  There is a lot to do here children seemed to be having a blast. The main building contains a two-lane bowling alley and a screening room (where family-friendly DVDs are shown afternoons and evenings), both free. There are outdoor and indoor pools and a gorgeous health club. A spa, already offering treatments at any hour of the day or night, will be completed by early next year. At the beach which is dubbed the Canoe Club there are boats, Ping-Pong and badminton equipment, horseshoes, croquet and, at lunch, a limited grill menu.      But the pièce de résistance is the resorts restaurant, called Kanu (get it canoe?), where the food lives up to the high (28-foot) ceilings and higher prices. At dinner, the miso-glazed cod ($29) was delectable, as was the Grand Marnier French toast ($10) at breakfast. Theres an informal bistro next to Kanu","excerpt":"coffee and pastries are available every day from 5 a.m. until 7 a.m., when the restaurant opens.    ROOM SERVICE  Available at any hour. Then, too, theres your in-room kitchen (which includes, perhaps unnecessarily, a full-size oven).    THE BOTTOM LINE  In summer, rooms are $360 to more than $1,000. (My room, in the lowest price category, came to $398.25 with tax.) Thats only for 19 hours check-in is at 4 p.m., check-out at 11 a.m. (and the hotel will deactivate your key card at 11 oclock sharp). If booking by phone, expect to be asked, What brings you to Lake Placid? which is either nice or nosy. As a reporter traveling incognito, I wasnt able to tell the truth.

At least one leading newspaper gives a barista-of-the-year award. ''Coffee Guide ... Sydney'' rates 120 of the city's top cafes.

Purchases by two large lumber distributors yesterday helped extend price gains, said Curt Cunningham, president of Pacific Futures Trading in Seattle.   \\"If the spruce mills need an excuse to be bullish, they certainly got a reason today with two of the biggest participants in distribution back in the marketplace,\\" Mr. Cunningham said. He did not identify the buyers.   Spruce lumber for delivery in March, the most active month, posted the maximum one-day gain allowed by the exchange. The contract rose $5, to $281.20 for 1,000 board feet.   January lumber, which has no daily limit, gained $5.40, to $300.40 for 1,000 board feet. The price is the highest ever for lumber futures, Mr. Cunningham said.   Wheat futures prices rose for the sixth consecutive session on the Chicago Board of Trade amid continued speculation that the amount of Australian wheat damaged by rain could exceed estimates, analysts said.   The Australian Wheat Board estimates heavy rains in December rendered 4.2 million metric tons of the country's 14-million-ton wheat harvest unfit for human consumption.   \\"There are trade guesses that 5 million or 6 million tons eventually will be downgraded to animal feed,\\" said Susan Leighty, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York.

TIBETAN ARTISTRY     The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale has one of the most comprehensive collections of Tibetan material outside Asia. Selected items are now on display through April 12 in an exhibition called \\"Word and Image: Sacred Languages of Tibet,\\" organized by Amy Heller of the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris.    In 1950, the Dalai Lama donated to the university a 100-volume set of the Kanjur, the Tibetan Buddhist scriptures, and the collection was further enhanced by the bequest of Edna Bryner Schwab in the 1960's.    Among the earliest treasures is a ninth-century copy of the \\"Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom,\\" one of the first Buddhist texts written in the Tibetan language on long horizontal leaves enclosed in ornately carved wooden covers. There are several colorful banner paintings called tang-kas, numerous block print portraits of Buddhas, lamas and female deities as well as sculptures and objects used in religious rituals.    The library is at 121 Wall Street in New Haven, open weekdays from 8:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Call 432-2977 for more information. FRANCESCO CLEMENTE     Naples, Italy, where he was born; Madras, India, where he visits each year, and New York City, where he lives, are the cultural inspirations for Francesco Clemente's work. An exhibition of more then 100 of his watercolors, gouaches, book pages and papier-mache figures may be seen in Hartford at the Wadsworth Atheneum through March 17.   Many of the pieces in \\"Francesco Clemente: Three Worlds,\\" on view in the first floor Austin Gallery, are self-portraits, some wall-sized, others no larger than a book page. Twins are a theme he uses frequently, with the two separate images pieced into a single work. The influences of his early studies in Naples and Rome, the miniatures of India and his association with the poets and writers of Manhattan can be seen in the various periods of this retrospective.   The Atheneum, at 600 Main Street, is open Tuesday through Sunday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $3, $1.50 for students and the elderly, and free for children.

The professional energy managers do not expect energy prices ever to return to the low levels of the early 1970's, or even to stabilize at today's levels.   One barometer of such views is interest in cogeneration - the production of energy in two forms, such as electricity and steam, from a single fuel source.
