Viking, $16.95)\\n\\nWhen first introduced, 17-year-old Callant Newkirk seems such a normal a product of small-town America that his rapid fall from upright son of a widowed mother to accused child molester seems improbable. However, when the author's vision of the dark underside of Cal's apparent innocence is accepted, ''What She Told Him'' takes on a driving force of its own. Cal's emotional descent begins when he learns from his closest friend that his father may not have been the World War II hero about whom his mother has woven romantic tales, but a rapist whose assault forced her to abandon her home town. Cal's mother dies before he can confront her on the issue. But the idea that he may have inherited the tainted passions of a depraved and violent man eats away at Cal like slow-working poison. He marries badly, is racked by disturbing sexual fantasies and goes to jail for a crime he did not commit but, somehow, feels himself capable of committing. Indeed, until he unravels the mystery of his father's identity - which takes us to the last pages of the novel - Cal's life unfolds with the guilt-driven logic of a nightmare. Carolyn Doty convincingly evokes the bleak terrors of prison, the narrow decencies and patriotism of heartland American, as well as Cal's tormented psyche","excerpt":"and her varied cast of characters drop clues like crumbs that finally lead Cal toward salvation.

Born in Vienna, Austria, she emigrated to the United States with her husband and young children in 1938, shortly following the Anschluss. She resided for many years in Forest Hills, Queens and later in West Stockbridge, MA. She was an artist and art scholar, a member of Artists Equity, and had a long and prolific career as a portraitist, still-life and landscape painter. She accrued an outstanding art library and slide collection. The latter contained unique views of museum quality. The entire collection of slides was donated to Dartmouth College. Her expertise as an art scholar was recognized by the United States Information Service for which, in 1956, she gave a series of lectures in France on American Art. During her years in West Stockbridge she was active in the community, and continued to foster her academic interests by sponsoring art scholarships for local high school students. In many ways Suzanne Porges was symbolic of the generation of immigrants from Central Europe who grew up in the early years of this century only to have their secure family life and intellectual milieu interrupted by the Second World War. Many assimiliated Jews could not meet the stringent requirements of Aryan purity imposed by the Nazis. The coming of Hitler forced upon her the recognition of her ancestral roots. While not raised as a Jew, her journals reveal that she had no doubts of her ancestry, and how she would be treated. It was her sensitivity and appreciation of imminent danger that prompted her to write to a close acquaintance, William Rosenwald, only a few days following the German annexation of Austria. His assistance enabled the family's rapid exodus from Europe, sparing them catastrophe from the Holocaust. Her family attributes its survival to her vision and initiative.

For that we must be grateful to the public spirit, the local pride of its townspeople in their great writer - and, yes, to their artistic conscience, in a world that sees all too much destruction going on around us.\\n\\nHere is a place with the charm unbroken, the spell still upon it that first drew me to it more than 20 years ago.

Technically he is endowed with a neat figure, natural turn-out, exceptional elevation, impeccable turns and beats, strong but sensitive feet (rare in a man) and a suppleness laced with a fiery dash of Slav temperament which permits him more grace than most men could get away with. When he makes one of his great loping runs like a cheetah caught behind bars, he seems to be made of more elastic material than normal humanity.\\"  Alexander Bland,   The Observer (London), Feb. 23, 1962     \\"As to his beats, we have not, I think, seen their like before. Soft, without strain, without vestige of hurry, with the feet fluttering as though motivated by a bird's wing rather than by a man's muscle, his entrechats are beyond description.\\"  A. H. Franks,   The Dancing Times (London), March 1962    \\"A pop dancer -- that's what we've got -- a pop dancer, at last. What the telly did for art, what Billy Graham did for religion, Nureyev has done for ballet. . . . Pop dancers, like pop singers, have got to have a gimmick or some special thing about them, like tears or a wiggle or a half-starved little-boy look","excerpt":"and I think Nureyev's thing is that even when he is behaving in a withdrawn and gentlemanly way you feel that he may suddenly snarl and bite you in the neck.\\"  Richard Buckle,   The Sunday Times of London, May 20, 1962   \\"Nureyev, with his shock of unruly hair, his sullen expression, seems indeed, at first glance, like a beatnik in ballet tights. . . . But there is nothing crude or gauche about this animal. He is catlike in both his elegance of action and his enigmatic expression. The discipline of a premier danseur appears to cloak a creature of wild and beautiful movement impulses.\\" Walter Terry,   The New York Herald Tribune, June 10, 1962   \\"From the very beginning of the 'Flower Festival' pas de deux Mr. Nureyev showed why he has been an object of dance attention during the past year. It is because of his extraordinary personality projection, which is the result of a natural stage instinct developed with the most careful calculation, and because of the unusual quality of his dance movements. He has an acute consciousness of every part of his body from the top of his head to the tips of his fingers and toes; he knows that every little inflection of it counts and he sees to it that the audience is made aware of each inflection.\\"  Allen Hughes,   The New York Times, Oct. 22, 1962   From the Start, Superlatives"},{"year":"1966","title":"I HAVE often said that \\"good\\" (i.e., favorable) reviews can  help a book, but \\"bad\\" reviews won't hurt it","excerpt":"and I usually cite the example of the phenomenally successful Mickey Spillane, who has never, to my ...

It was made by the British and Dominions concern under the supervision of Herbert Wilcox. It gives a faithful transcription of the harrowing post-war experiences of Captain Stephen Sorrell, M. C., but in an episodic fashion, which often causes the story to be somewhat abrupt in its development.H. B. Warner, who acted Captain Sorrell in the mute edition, again plays the rôle in the current offering","excerpt":"and if his acting is not always as restrained as one might wish, it is frequently affecting. And after all, the author himself piled on the agony, a fact which gives both Mr. Warner and Mr. Wilcox an excuse to overemphasize the depiction of the hardships and misfortunes of the ex-British officer.Although there were disappointing spots in the Brenon film, its continuity was infinitely better than the present work, and also the silent production had the advantage of many impressive glimpses of London, the upper reaches of the Thames and the English countryside. Admitting that Mr. Wilcox gives an occasional flash of a charming country town, there are not enough of such views.There are, however, superior performances in several rôles in the Wilcox film. Ruby Miller, as Flo Palfrey, gives a clever portrait of the owner of the Angel Hotel in Staunton. But the scenes in which she performs are sometimes afflicted with an awkward silence. Flo's husband is virtually an invalid, and she sets her cap at Sorrell, who is doing odd jobs, including scrubbing floors in her tavern. It is Sorrell's refusal of her offer that causes her to discharge him. Afterward he finds employment as an assistant porter in Roland's inn, the Pelican, at Winstonbury. It is at this place that he encounters the bullying head porter Buck, who collects the tips and makes Sorrell do all the heavy work. So once again Sorrell is perceived puffing and panting as he carries a trunk up three flights of stairs.Hugh Williams is another player who serves the film well. He portrays Sorrell's son, Kit, for whom the father denies himself and consents to do any honorable toil. Mr. Williams is the adult Kit and Peter Penrose acts Kit as a boy. The episodes dealing with Sorrell's son as a surgeon, his successful operations and the encouragement he receives from Dr. Orange are nicely fashioned. The tragic note in the end is touched upon with laudable reticence. H.B.

I confess all these my sins and transgressions from the bottom of my heart, and, in the hope of confessing them more often, I am firmly resolved constantly to improve on the evil manner of life which I have begun. Therefore I beg for holy dispensation, if it can be managed","excerpt":"and if not, it's all one to me, for the game will go on all the same.\\"It's one of the many unexpected achievements of Klaus Kirschner's fine 1976 German film, \\"Mozart — A Childhood Chronicle,\\" that it conveys so much of the laughing spirit of this most debonair of geniuses while also seeing all of the humiliations and frustrations that are the givens for an artist who survives at the pleasure of his patrons. Maria Theresa once wrote to a thick-brained son suggesting that he find something for Mozart to do. It was a halfhearted recommendation because Wolfgang Amadeus and his family made her uneasy. \\"They move around like beggars,\\" she said with impatience, as if anyone with any gumption would just settle in one spot and open an empire.\\"Mozart — A Childhood Chronicle,\\" which opens today at the Public Theater, initially looks extremely mild and modest, but don't be fooled. It's a wonderfully big, complex and moving film that should not be missed by anyone who has even a passing interest in the work of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and in the lives and relationships that were a part of his work.Mr. Kirschner, a German film maker otherwise unknown to me, has based his screenplay on that series of brilliantly un-self-conscious letters exchanged among the members of the Mozart family — Wolfgang Amadeus, his father, his mother and his older sister, \\"Nannerl.\\" However, instead of making any serious attempt to illustrate the letters, he provides vivid, if spare, visual contexts for their contents, which are spoken on the soundtrack. The film, photographed in black and white and mostly in close-ups and medium shots, is uninhabited except by Mozarts and by a few key figures who can't be ignored. Yet the film is anything but empty.It is alive with the exuberance, the wit, the intelligence and the love of these four people who had the gift of writing letters the way most people talk. The contents of each letter are carefully answered in a succeeding letter, so that, at times, Mr. Kirschner can quietly dispense with the recurring image of one person's studying a piece of paper while another's voice is on the soundtrack.Toward the end of the film, when Leopold is scolding his son for a variety of things, including his lack of seriousness and for falling in with bad company, we are presented with a series of scenes in which Leopold and Wolfgang, in alternate close-ups, rail at each other in the most civilized tones. The effect is astonishingly moving and — dare I use the word? — cinematic.I should also point out that the film, which covers Mozart's life from age 7 until his early 20's, has a running time of almost four hours, yet it seems less than half that long.With the exception of the sequence in which Mozart's mother dies in Paris, Mr. Kirschner avoids the temptation to use the music to illustrate emotion. The music is there (quite a lot of it and one still wishes for more), but it doesn't exist to inform our feelings. There is sometimes a historical point to be made from the use of a particular selection. Mostly, though, the music exists without explanation, as it did in Mozart's head.The performances are properly reserved. This is not, after all, a film of surface confrontations. The three young actors who play Mozart look enough alike to have grown one into the other. Karl-Maria Schley, who is excellent as Leopold, suggests a youngish George Arliss. Ingeborg Schroeder, Nina Palmers, Elisabeth Bronfen and Dietlind Hübner are enchantingly pretty as the young women in Wolfgang's life.The film that \\"Mozart\\" will be compared with, I suppose, is Jean-Marie Straub's \\"The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach,\\" beside which \\"Mozart\\" looks as busy as a Ken Russell production. The comparison is really of no point. \\"Mozart\\" is not about music, but about the interior life that produced that music, about states of mind that are sometimes miraculously illuminated in those hundreds of family letters. \\"I whistle my own tune,\\" Wolfgang wrote his sister from Milan in September 1771, \\"and no one answers me.\\" Film: 'Mozart,' Chronicle Of a Genius Growing Up:A Family of Letters"},{"year":"1982","title":"I found Lyman B.

By Diana Trilling.  341 pp. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $14.95.   THE combination of a fatal crime and a fateful trial is apparently hard to resist, and when Jean Harris pulled the trigger on Herman Tarnower, whatever her intention, she joined the pantheon of accused murderers, from Lizzie Borden to Alice Crimmins, whose place in American social history appears secure. All of the elements of high drama, from the social elevation of the principals to their emotional abasement, were present in abundance, and soon so was the press. Yet the level of commentary in the period that followed was far from satisfactory. Between overeager feminists rationalizing revenge and overinnocent editorialists decrying the militarization of the battle of the sexes, there was little real exchange","excerpt":"and if the air was strained in public, I would guess it was strained in private as well - the subject of triangles being a delicate matter in many households, and Mrs. Harris's solution being, to say the least, extreme. Into this breach between the common awareness of the spectacle, on the one hand, and the absence of a common framework in which to discuss it, on the other, now steps social and cultural critic Diana Trilling with a book offering a kind of amnesty against selfincrimination to both sexes. It is all right to be interested in the Scarsdale murder trial, she reassures us. It was a genuinely significant event.

He is always startled, for example, when a press agent thanks him for favorably reviewing one of these events.  The uneasy feeling arises that a transaction has been completed between him, the agent and the agent's performer-client and that the critic has unwittingly been the final link in a complex business deal. First, a little promotion and publicity, then some music played, a critic in attendance, and out of this mill grinds the review from which the most benign adjectives are surgically extracted and used to fertilize further promotion, further concerts and more reviews.

Some hints of a private life nonetheless break through here and there. Lippmann enjoyed ''Winnie the Pooh'' and ''Green Pastures.'' He was disappointed in his meeting with the philosopher Henri Bergson.

Clumps of cowslip, those rare fragrant yellow flowers, indicate the chalky soil below. After Bakewell, the scenery becomes familiar to anyone who has read Jane Austen's ''Pride and Prejudice'' and remembers Elizabeth Bennett's first impression of Pemberly, Fitzwilliam Darcy's country house in Derbyshire: ''They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the woods ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberly House, situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound.

Corral as among the leading first causes of world cinema. Students of history will remember the 1860's as traditionally signalling the end of the old, the birth of the new Japan. But for the movies it was a time of absolutely wholesale murder, largely on a freelance basis.\\"Tenchu\\" (which means \\"Heaven's Punishment,\\" and is supposed to be the cry of the assassin while dispatching his victim) is the story of an uncouth samurai named Izo (Shintaro Katsu), attached to a leader of the Tosa clan, for whom he kills not wisely but too well. Such is his zeal and so spectacular is his record that the leader (Tatsuya Nakadai), fearing too much of the wrong publicity, dismisses him, cancels his sake-shop expense account, has him blacklisted and more or less conspires in his arrest as a common vagrant Izo ultimately gets a self-sacrificial revenge, but it comes only as an ironic postscript to a misspent life.\\"Tenchu\\" suffers, as do a good many samurai dramas, from a hero with more character traits than character","excerpt":"and in general, despite its slickness and its commitment to violent action, it suggests a craft that is overburdened with wasteful detail. Too much mood setting, too much obviously effective wide-screen composition, too many beads of sweat on Izo's screwed-up face—it is not art cinema but it is very arty, and it is as far as I can imagine from the proportionate balance of such masters as Ozu and Mizoguchi.However, there are points of interest. These include two pleasant performances—one by Yujiro Ishihara as a friend of Izo, a gentle sane man to whom of course nobody listens; another by Mitsuko Baisho as the prostitute Izo frequents, who plays with a coarse but complex vitality that might grace a better movie.Along with its bloody murders, \\"Tenchu\\" offers one equally bloody suicide. It is performed by a disgraced aristocrat played by the late Yukio Mishima, the novelist. Mishima, in addition to writing, acted in some movies, and I gather he rather coveted such roles. This must have been one of the last before his suicide in earnest—which indicated that the spirit of the old Japan is not dead, but only repeatedly dying.

For all that, it has a bittersweet poignance and Mr. Puccini underscores its climaxes with music that is sensuous and sad.Which is as it should be. Opera plots are usually no more than the manikins upon which a composer hangs a rich garment of music","excerpt":"and in the film the director, to our mind, has given us too much manikin and not enough music. The story of Manon, foolish of love, is one which no doubt will be told as long as young folk are penniless and some old men are rich. But certainly no one has ever traveled so often from pillar to post—from rich aristocrat to disinherited lover. A little too often, in fact. Either fate or Manon or the scenarist should have come to the point long before Manon's death.In the production, the director has regained some of the nostalgic gayety of a brocaded age. And through the glittering salons the actors move as credible people—particularly young Alida Valli, who, in the leading role, is not only tremulously beautiful but emotionally sincere.

They do it in \\"The Devil and the 10 Commandments,\\" which came to the Paris yesterday.At the start of this two-hour, picture, made up of seven vignettes, each supposedly concerned with a major or minor sin, a snake wiggles out of the mouth of a gargoyle and, speaking in French (with English subtitles), proclaims that it is our old friend, the Devil, and that it is going to show some evidence of its work. (Of course, it says a lot more, in slyly oblique, sardonic terms, but that's when it starts to get roguish and a little hard to comprehend.)And then the film presents us with this succession of short to long vignettes in which the displays of misbehavior range from deadly to dull.There's the first one in which Michel Simon, who looks like a great, benign toad, blasphemes beyond the endurance of the mother superior of a nunnery in which he works and has to be mildly reprimanded by a bishop who was his boyhood friend. And there's the second, in which a prissy fellow, Henri Tissot, follows a strip-tease artist home and finds that she is married to a dull custodian. Both are equally banal.Next is the deadly item. In this one, Charles Aznavour plays a meek chap who gives up the priesthood in order to get revenge upon the man who has foully corrupted his sister and caused her to commit suicide.The method he chooses is Draconian—self-sacrificial, indeed—and so utterly obvious and romantic it amounts to a big, fat cliché. And that is the charge to be leveled against most of the other episodes.One that seems to give the most promise—one in which our old friend, Fernandel, turns up at an Alpine peasant's cottage and brings harmony to a bitter family by fobbing himself off as God—concludes with a gimmick so corny it could finish a burlesque skit. Even Fernandel, a shameless actor, turns his head when it is pulled.Several good actors are wasted in two of the other vignettes, both of them written so poorly they barely make fictional sense. In one, Françoise Arnoul, Micheline Presle, Mel Ferrer and Claude Dauphin go through a lengthy, tedious business of exchanging infidelities and jewels","excerpt":"and in the other, Danielle Darrieux and Alain Delon do a bit about an aging actress being encountered by her illegitimate son.The only vignette of the seven that tickled me at all was the last in which Louis de Funes and Jean-Claude Brialy play a couple of comedy crooks wo have a tug-of-war over a satchelful of money taken from a bank, and then see it get away from them in a typically farcical twist.But the several guffaws that are triggered by this rapidly paced little skit are slight compensation for the previous tedium.

Over her 40-year career, Ms. Monk has created a distinctive vocal vocabulary that strikes some as deeply moving, others as frivolous. Well, a bel-canto cadenza elicits the same reactions, and it is also based on a highly developed technique. This past week, Ms. Monk has been leading a vocal workshop to teach her technique to young singers","excerpt":"and in the workshop's closing concert on Sunday, those singers will perform her works.

He had a good start in this subject for at the head of the cast is Conrad Veidt, the brilliant German actor who triumphed through his excellent work in \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\\" and in this, his first American screen adventure, Mr. Veidt does more than any one else to make it interesting. But even he, occasionally, has been forced to do a little strained acting.It often happens in this production that you know that a player knows just where his feet and hands are and how he is holding his head. The chief offender in this way is Arthur Edmund Carewe, who made his mark in camera histrionics as Svengali. Here Mr. Carewe causes the character he impersonates to be quite artificial. As Lieutenant Destin he appears to be much more concerned about the fit of his tunic and how he is standing than about the action of the episode. In fact, Mr. Veidt, by some of his studious playing, makes Mr. Carewe's theatric posing all the more noticeable.This story deals with the tragic experiences of Dr. Paul La Roche, who is discovered in a French island prison, to which he has been sentenced for ten years for the crime of euthanasia—causing the death of a patient suffering from an incurable disease. Soon after the introductory scenes, Mr. Melford starts on his movie exaggerations by showing the convicts receiving horribly bad food while the Warden of the prison and the doctor are enjoying an orgy of caviar and other delicacies. Mr. Melford is not content with this, for when the doctor is summoned to the cells to inspect the prisoners' rations, he grabs a chicken leg before leaving the table and is perceived eating this as he locks at the men behind the bars. The Warden, for some reason known only to Mr. Melford, also picks up a piece of chicken and devours it in this easiest way.Dr. La Roche is called upon to attend to the Warden when the latter is shot by a convict, and the Warden's assistant, Lieutenant Destin, assures Dr. La Roche that he will receive his liberty for saving the Warden's life. The prison chief, however, is a strangely adamant creature, who, after he is well enough, scoffs at the idea of freeing Dr. La Roche.Through a ruse La Roche escapes from the prison (which looks almost like the Cháteau d'If) and he manages to reach Marseilles. There he meets Dr. Fontaine, for whom he performs an operation, as Fontaine's eyesight has been weakened. When Fontaine goes blind, La Roche, Fontaine and his sister, Yvonne, go to Algiers, where La Roche poses as Fontaine, gaining medical renown for his remarkable skill in his surgical operations.Eventually Lieutenant Destin turns up on the scene, and one day, just through La Roche's stoop-shouldered walk, it suddenly occurs to the army officer that this eminent surgeon is the former convict. At that moment both are infatuated with Yvonne, and La Roche is in the awkard position of having to pretend that she is his sister.In the early chapters Mr. Veidt is seen with long hair and a beard. He has the facuity of putting life into his part, lending true suspense to most of the incidents wherein he appears. Ian Keith as Dr. Fontaine was a splendid selection for this rôle, as Mr. Keith's efforts in this film are only second to those of Mr. Veidt. Mr. Melford, however, muddles up a sequence in which Keith has to shoot Lieutenant Destin, and this is not to be blamed on Mr. Keith. Barbara Bedford is charming as Yvonne until the attacks high pitches of emotionalism","excerpt":"and in this and a number of other episodes one is constrained to wish that Mr. Melford had paused and thought for a moment how people would really act in such circumtances.An Ethnological Film.A wonderfully interesting ethnological film study of African savages was screened yesterday at noon at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse for the benefit of Dr. Isaiah Bowman, Director of the American Geographical Society. This production, which was made about three years ago by Carl von Hoffman on his expedition from Cairo to Cape Town, will probably be exhibited publicly at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse when captions have been written for it. Mr. Hoffman said yesterday that he was considering lecturing with the film, the making of which took one year and four months.Mr. Hoffman in this subject follows the Nile to Khartum, and then he goes to the Sudan, to Uganda, the Congo and to the Cape. There are \\"shots\\" taken with a telephotal lens that show hippopotamases, crocodiles and elephant. But the picture is mostly concerned with the dances, ceremonies and customs of various tribes. One of the absorbing chapters in this feature is that in which the natives pretend that they are hyenas and lions, and they are said to work themselves up into a state of excitement where they would quickly use their spears. The lion man, who is chased by the others, wears a lion's head, and when this little party has come to end he quickly takes off his mack, for there are a number of his colleagues who are so intoxicated with the experience that were he to keep to the lion's head they would kill him.Mr. Hoffman depicts how many of the women of these tribes not only do most of the work in the house and on the soil, but that they accomplish their endless tasks with their babies attached to their backs. He also shows that when the youngsters are old enough to look out for themselves they suffer through the need of maternal attention.The extraordinary endurance of the natives in their dances and their strange beliefs, some modest, and their ideas that the Spirit appears in the flames, are illustrated. Mr. von Hoffman also called attention, to the scars on the natives and he shows the way they are made with a primitive knife. How they manufacture cloth of a sort from the inside bark of a tree and their manner of producing fire is also postrayed.The burial of a king is another wierd chapter, for the savages believe that everywhere the king's body passes must be burned to the grund. These natives anticipate such a happening by constructing new dwellings, sometimes more than a hundred miles from where they have lived; yet the two cmmunities bear the same name. This explorer-producer also shows the life of the savage, by depicting infants, then youths and girls,, then the marriage ceremony.In passing over the shallow rivers. Mr. von Hoffman said that if a native happened to step on a crocodile, he wuld disappear under the water and the other natives, after clambering to safety would look upon it as highly amusing incident.

Mr. Wicker seems to underestimate the value the President places on fairness.

His endorsement of statehood responds to his knowledge that Puerto Ricans do not enjoy equal treatment as United States citizens. Yet we fight and die for this country side by side with everybody else.   There are more men and women from Puerto Rico in the Persian Gulf today, proportionately, than there are from each of the 50 states. Yet Puerto Ricans did not elect the President that sent them there.   The issue of statehood for Puerto Rico is one of civil rights.   Mr. Wicker portrays Puerto Ricans as opportunists. He argues that statehood would be devastating for Puerto Rico, resulting in the loss of what, to him, are indispensable tax exemptions and in significant unemployment. He suggests that Puerto Ricans prefer statehood anyway because of a welfare mentality: \\"One reason\\" -- for the preference -- \\"is that many islanders are too poor to pay income tax, and statehood would make many eligible for nearly double welfare benefits -- causing an estimated $17 billion rise in Federal outlays for Puerto Rico, a short-term bonanza.\\"   In a poll conducted in Puerto Rico last summer by the newspaper El Mundo and Channel 40 of Puerto Rico, and reported in the national press, those polled ranked considerations about which status would bring more assistance from the Federal Government as last in importance of seven choices they were given.

The particular charm of Oaxaca (pronounced wah-HAH-kah) comes from its juxtaposition of cultures. Although the Zapotec Indians shaped many of the sites between 500 B.C. and the 12th century, the Mixtecs, when they took control, were content to use, continue and sometimes even develop the earlier forms.

Together with Richard Leacock and D. A. Pennebaker, he began shooting on locations in and around New York City on a project that came to be known as \\"One A.M.\\" (\\"One American Movie\\").\\"One A.M.\\" was never completed. But from some of its footage, and from footage shot while it was being made, the team of Leacock-Pennebaker have put together another film, called \\"One P.M.\\" (\\"One Parallel Movie\\"), which opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum.\\"One P.M.\\" contains most of the cast of \\"One A.M.\\"—Rip Torn, Tom Hayden, Eldridge Cleaver, The Jefferson Airplane, LeRoi Jones, among others","excerpt":"and it also contains a good deal of Jean-Luc Godard directing and Richard Leacock photographing \\"One A.M.,\\" along with a couple of sound girls, some New York policemen, one or two producer types, and, watching in the background, Godard's wife, Anne Wiazemski, and assorted friends and relatives.To a degree, then, \\"One P.M.\\" functions as the record of the making of a movie, and in certain sequences it may be all that is left of a movie that was not finally made. There are moments that seem to belong wholly to the rigid Godard geometry of the late sixties—most notably Rip Tom's lengthy wire-cage elevator ride straight up and down over the darkening Manhattan skyline, all the while mimicking words and phrases from a radical speech played on a tape recorder that he holds in his arms.But very little of \\"One P.M.\\" is like this. For as handled by D. A. Pennebaker (I should guess, the principal photographer) the film is less an essay in radical politics or in Godardian esthetics or. Heaven forbid, in the useful craft of documentary, than it is homage to the zoom lens—an optical contrivance that in the hands of bad cinematographers, to whom it mostly appeals, keeps things artificially jumping, and, at least in this case, 60 per cent out of focus.I don't know why \\"One A.M.\\" was abandoned. There has been talk of Godard's failure to understand the nature of the movement in America.

It stands on its own, then, which does not give it too firm a footing. For the truth of the matter is that \\"The Dybbuk,\\" made in Poland, is almost oppressively tedious, stricken by an inadequate technical knowledge and hamstrung (excuse the sacrilege) by a frequently infantile groping after the mystic.After sifting through the learned reports upon Mr. Ansky's drama by Brooks Atkinson and others, we are struck by the unreal, semi-fantastic quality which seems to have invested, most of its stage productions. Sets, costumes, make-up appear to have borrowed the almost cubistic unreality of, say, \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\\" Under such treatment, \\"The Dybbuk\\" might well have impressed its spectators as other-worldly, and been therefore more persuasive.

With an obvious trick dissolve, oft-repeated, it conjures its ghostly messenger upon an open highway, makes him vanish or reappear at will. When the Dybbuk—a restless spirit between heaven and hell—takes up his abode in the body of the maiden he loved, there are the obvious sound effects of wind and moaning. A spirit's presence flutters a screen, makes the candle flames bend. Heavy, sulphurous smoke celebrates the invocation of the devil. And so on. . . .An Ill-Omened PledgeThe fable, if you've not heard it, is of the two men who pledged their unborn children to marriage. It is an ill-omened pledge, as the ghostly messenger (who looks like Karloff) warns. When the children are of age, the maiden is betrothed to another, and the poor student, driven by desperation, turns away from the Talmud and seeks in the dread Kabala a solution of his misery. He dies, invoking the devil, and the maiden bids his restless soul enter her body. So she becomes a Dybbuk, possessed of a spirit whom the good tsadik must exorcise. But when she is freed, she hears her lover call and follows him.That is a tale for fantasy, not for reality. Told as bluntly as it has been, it strikes of stupidity, silly superstition, outmoded religion. And, aside from its thematic weaknesses, it is overlong, static in presentation, rather awkwardly contrived. Yet, for all that, it is an interesting record—else we should not have taken so long to dismiss it—as incredible in its way as a documentary film of life among the pygmies or a trip to the Middle Ages. It is that odd.

It started out with a bang: the self-destruction of Jean Tinguely's suicide machine at the Museum of Modern Art (1960)","excerpt":"and it ended noisily, too, with demonstrations echoing the spirit of rebellion in the larger world by artists fired up over the Vietnam war and the small representation of women and black artists in museums. It had a swarm of movements: Happenings, Pop, Color Field, Op, Minimal, Psychedelic, Kinetic, Funk, Conceptual, and numerous ways of promoting them, from the savvy exhibitions initiated in 1962 by the late Alan Solomon at the Jewish Museum to the ambitious performances staged by artists involved with the special-effects-loving group known as Experiments in Art and Technology.   Seen from where we are now, perhaps through a screen of glamorizing nostalgia, the 60's also seemed to have a special zeitgeist: an optimistic sense of possibility carried over from the glory days of Abstract Expressionism; a belief in the pursuit of art and its power to affect where the world was going. And there was something else that seems missing in today's expanded scene - a feeling of camaraderie, the notion of a common endeavor.

Five years ago, a young singer and actor named Thaddeus Motyka decided he'd had enough of summer stock, operetta, Off-Broadway and regional theater - at least as a performer. ''I began to feel that even in the best theaters, the performers are not treated correctly,'' he recalls. ''We were treated as items to be moved around, rather than as artists who needed all the support we could get to bring our material to life. At that point, I stopped seeing the theater from an actor's viewpoint, and began looking at the sets and lighting as if I were a director, and at the scheduling and living conditions as if I were a producer. I felt I had been in training and in show business for several years, and that I had something to offer. But I wanted to be responsible for the whole of a production, not just my own part. I was interested in directing.''   Mr. Motyka, who is now 31 years old, has had his way.

Corneille's play is very largely concerned with the affections of two young women, Camille, Galba's niece, and Plautine, daughter of the senator Vinius, who are both in love with Othon","excerpt":"and it is at pains to juxtapose the irreconcilable requirements of a drive for power with the urgencies of tragic love.By placing his film in ancient settings (the Palatine Hill, and later, the Villa Doria Pamphili) that are however surrounded by the sights and sounds of contemporary Rome (traffic is the background noise for the earlier parts of \\"Othon\\"; an unnaturally loud fountain for the later parts) Straub, co-directing with his wife, Daniele Huillet, has included himself in an historical time scheme of considerable, multi-layered complexity—including, of course, 17th-century France (and the Rome of 17th-century France) as well as the ancient and the modern worlds.Such complexity is perfectly typical of Straub, as is his ease with history, with literature and art. He has already filmed literary and dramatic works by Heinrich Böll and Ferdinand Bruckner and has made a movie, a great one, consisting almost wholly of concertized excerpts from Johann Sebastian Bach. Although he has the best kind of serious reputation he has little commercial appeal, and each of his previous features, \\"Unreconciled\\" and \\"Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach,\\" owes its introduction here to the New York Film Festival.This year, as in the past, the festival paid Straub its greatest tribute (the only valuable, though not infallible, objective test of a film's importance I know of) when at the press screening of \\"Othon\\" half the audience got up and walked out.Although in color, and quite handsomely costumed, \\"Othon\\" makes very few concessions to ordinary sensuous response. Characters speak Corneille's verses rapidly and with minimal expression (actually, expression varies: The older men, Galba and Vinius, are allowed both gesture and inflection; the young are allowed scarcely so much as a turn of the head). The camera pans, often so as to avoid the face of the character speaking, and moves in and out—and except for one glorious tracking shot, that is almost all the camera does.And yet this Puritan cinema offers rewards for the sustained contemplation it demands—not the rewards of special insight, or of mystical vision, but rather of a perfectly controlled probity, assurance and understanding of a movie subject's rhythms and spacial potential. A love for Straub's work will come—but only with time and to the astute and the properly disposed.\\"Othon\\" is magnificently performed by its almost expressionless cast. I admired especially the film critic Adriano Aprà as Othon and Straub himself (a significant casting) as the murderous prefect Lacus.

FROM THE OPINION    To protect the privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, we have held that the police must terminate interrogation of an accused in custody if the accused requests the assistance of counsel. (Miranda v. Arizona, 1966) We reinforced the protections of Miranda in Edwards v. Arizona (1981), which held that once the accused requests counsel, officials may not reinitiate questioning \\"until counsel has been made available\\" to him. The issue in the case before us is whether Edwards's protection ceases once the suspect has consulted with an attorney.    Edwards is \\"designed to prevent police from badgering a defendant into waiving his previously asserted Miranda rights.\\" (Michigan v. Harvey, 1990) The rule ensures that any statement made in subsequent interrogation is not the result of coercive pressures. Edwards conserves judicial resources which would otherwise be expended in making difficult determinations of voluntariness, and implements the protections of Miranda in practical and straightforward terms.   The merit of the Edwards decision lies in the clarity of its command and the certainty of its application. . . .    The Mississippi Supreme Court relied on our statement in Edwards that an accused who invokes his right to counsel \\"is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him. . . .\\" We do not interpret this language to mean, as the Mississippi court thought, that the protection of Edwards terminates once counsel has consulted with the suspect. In context, the requirement that counsel be \\"made available\\" to the accused refers to more than an opportunity to consult with an attorney outside the interrogation room.   We consider our ruling to be an appropriate and necessary application of the Edwards rule. A single consultation with an attorney does not remove the suspect from persistent attempts by officials to persuade him to waive his rights . . . . We decline to remove protection from police-initiated questioning based on isolated consultations with counsel who is absent when the interrogation resumes.   The exception to Edwards here proposed is inconsistent with Edwards's purpose to protect the suspect's right to have counsel present at custodial interrogation. It is inconsistent as well with Miranda. . . . FROM THE DISSENT    The Court today establishes an irrebuttable presumption that a criminal suspect, after invoking his Miranda right to counsel, can    never    validly waive that right during any police-initiated encounter, even after the suspect has been provided multiple Miranda warnings and has actually consulted his attorney. This holding builds on foundations already established in Edwards v. Arizona, but \\"the rule of Edwards is our rule, not a constitutional command","excerpt":"and it is our obligation to justify its expansion.\\" (Arizona v. Roberson, 1988, Kennedy, dissenting). Because I see no justification for applying the Edwards irrebuttable presumption when a criminal suspect has actually consulted with his attorney, I respectfully dissent.   The confession must be suppressed, not because it was \\"compelled,\\" nor even because it was obtained from an individual who could realistically be assumed to be unaware of his rights, but simply because this Court sees fit to prescribe as a \\"systemic assurance\\" that a person in custody who has once asked for counsel cannot thereafter be approached by the police unless counsel is present. Of course the Constitution's proscription of compelled testimony does not remotely authorize this incursion upon state practices. . . .   One should not underestimate the extent to which the Court's expansion of Edwards constricts law enforcement. Today's ruling, that the invocation of a right to counsel permanently prevents a police-initiated waiver, makes it largely impossible for the police to urge a prisoner who has initially declined to confess to change his mind -- or, indeed, even to ask whether he has changed his mind.   Today's extension of the Edwards prohibition is the latest stage of prophylaxis built upon prophylaxis, producing a veritable fairyland castle of imagined constitutional restriction upon law enforcement.

Indeed, he did more or less that with his metaphysical farce ''Jumpers'' back in 1972. It was harder to imagine him creating characters who could feel despair, weep salt tears, or even hurt very much.

She is the toast of the town, the desired of all, the ne plus ultra of something reminiscent of \\"The Blue Danube\\" waltz. A young lieutenant is one of her admirers; the boy's brother (saving him from the snare) also bows on bended knee. He is more fortunate, however, for he is accepted.\\"The Bohemian Dancer\\" differs from other Bohemian dancers in that there is at no time even a suspicion of betrayal. Counts appear always to remember they are gentlemen; the Archduke himself retains the mannerisms of a Germanic Peter Pan. It doesn't seem to occur to the dancer's father that he could (in the interests of historical accuracy) oil his pistol and start an extermination of the nobility.However, what the picture lacks in finesse it makes up in comedy. All the characters jump around blithely, and at the end of the play the younger brother falls into a lake. It isn't very good comedy—in fact, it can hardly be called comedy—but anything, rather than having the poor little dancer wronged by some alcoholic member of the upper classes.The synchronization of the picture contents itself by following the action of the film with suitable melodies.

It is being shown at the Alhambra in Leicester Square and thereby secures the advantage of as good a \\"send-off\\" as any of the transatlantic importations which get their first runs in London at the Capitol and the Plaza, the Carlton and the Tivoli, the Regal and the New Gallery. Alfred Hitchcock is responsible for the general direction, which is tantamount to saying that the British producing company has sought out the most expert guidance available in this country. Jack Hulbert and André Chariot have also been pressed into service and have assisted Mr. Hitchcock in his labors with their experienced counsels. There is a large cast, comprising favorites of the stage, vaudeville and the screen. There were many reasons for expecting \\"Elstree Calling\\" to be at least as good as anything of the same sort that had come from Hollywood. Is it? Some critics say it is better, others say it is just as good, but practically all of them agree that it isn't by any manner of means all that it should be. So far as the individual opinion of this deponent is worth recording, \\"Elstree Calling\\" is distinctly disappointing. It is a variety show, with the turns rather ingeniously strung together, but it is second-rate variety, despite the fact that the payroll of the stars who appear would total up to over $20,000 a week were they all figuring on the same bill at a music hall.An Experiment.\\"Elstree Calling\\" is admittedly an experiment designed to discover what are the tastes of English cinemagoers, and on that ground, as one critic pleads, it should not be judged too harshly. But, from another point of view, there could be no justification for any claim that American distributers who refused to show it on your side of the Atlantic were actuated by any motive other than that it was not likely to make any particular appeal to audiences outside of England. Elstree will have to call much louder to catch the ear of an American or any other foreign public.It appears that in one sequence the censor intervened disconcertingly. There is a playlet in which an amorous couple in a flat are surprised by the supposed husband of the lady, who appears from behind a curtain and shoots them both—only to discover immediately afterward that he is in the \\"wrong flat.\\" The censor objected to the kissing that was going on before the entrance of the avenger, and the scene had to be done all over again. What was cut out must have been very unpleasant indeed if it called for the censor's blue pencil, for there are not a few films now showing in London which would seem to have entirely escaped Mr. Shortt's attention. In fact the British film trade is reported to be highly \\"indignant at this censorship of a British film in view of scenes far more ardent and speeches verging on the objectionable in implication which the censor has recently passed.\\"Object to McLaglen Film.Special objection has been taken to the new Victor McLaglen film' \\"Hot for Paris.\\" One London critic denounces it in no measured terms, alleging that \\"of the indecencies which are Gallic it can at least be said that they are clever, after the manner of Lubitsch, but of the exploits of Mr. McLaglen as an American sailor in the less reputable resorts of Havre it can only be said that they are offensive. 'Bawdy' is the word chosen by the owners to describe Mr. McLaglen's present series of films, and bawdy they are.\\" Another critic writes. \\"It is a long time since a film as deliberately vulgar as 'Hot for Paris' has been seen in London. I hope it will be longer before anything of its type is seen again. A modified vulgarity, natural to the characters, as in 'The Cock-Eyed World,' may very occasionally have its place even on the screen. 'Hot for Paris' has not that justification.\\" This censorious critic admits, nevertheless, that \\"Hot for Paris\\" was received \\"with hilarious applause at the trade show\\"","excerpt":"and it may be added that when the writer saw it yesterday at the Capitol the audience appeared to show no signs of dissatisfaction.Even harsher things are being said of an English production which has just been \\"trade-shown\\" than of the American-made \\"Hot for Paris.\\" Mrs. Elinor Glyn has been at work for some time past at Elstree, in a rented studio, upon a story called \\"Knowing Men.\\" The authoress of \\"Three Weeks\\" has personally met all the costs of production in order that she might have a free hand in direction. Her sister designed and made the dresses; and one of her daughters, Lady (Rhys) Williams, has been assisted on the technical side and saving, according to her mother, many hundreds of pounds by her excellent photography.Mrs. Glyn used her own furniture, which had been brought over from America; and Carl Bresson, who is the leading man, wears in one scene a leopard skin (a possible variant on the tiger skin which figured so prominently in \\"Three Weeks\\"), which was given to another of the authoress's daughters, Lady Davson, by an African chieftain. Miss Elissa Landi plays the heroine, and another part is in the hand of David Herbert, a son of the Earl of Pembroke, who sports a Jacobean costume which was actually worn by an ancestor.Amid the preliminary gossip heard about \\"Knowing Men\\" great emphasis was laid on the fact that Mrs. Elinor Glyn, knowing English society as she did, would certainly be able to present a picture which would be more true to life and conditions in this country than some of the efforts which have been made at Hollywood in that direction. One enthusiastic cinema reporter who went to the trade show proclaimed \\"Knowing Men\\" to be a triumph. \\"A piquant prologue, spoken by Elinor Glyn herself, in which she presents various ways in which women know men, is followed by a delicious social satire,\\" writes this fervid acolyte, who goes on to say: \\"The plot moves somewhat slowly, but by far the greater part of 'Knowing Men' is a delicious example of subtle irony, so keenly pointed in its revelation of society as to make it at once the most natural and the most brilliant talking picture of its type. By comparison, it shows up the shoddiness of most of its predecessors, whether from Hollywood or London. The people of this picture are the people of real society, and not the people of film society. United Artists are to be congratulated on having secured a picture which shows that England can make films having all the finish of the finest work from any studio in the world. A few more films like 'Knowing Men' would make the [British] film quota superfluous.\\"Now that is praise indeed! But listen to this extract from a critic printed in The Daily Mail under the heading, \\"Blunt Truth—An Unpleasant Film\\": \\"Many a hardened filmgoer might well be sickened by the underlying implications of sly cynicism and the general tone of the talking film 'Knowing Men.' One is forced to regret that it is an English film. Mrs. Glyn's picture depicts man as possessing one characteristic alone, which compels him to ogle, then maul every woman he meets. Even the servants devote their energies to pursuing the heroine. The statement that the girl has just left a convent and that it is her first kiss which she bestows upon the hero does not impress one much. He was tickling her ankles well within the first hour of their meeting. 'Knowing Men' suggests that the world is ruled by the morals of the monkey-house and does so [sic] in a way at once superficial, pseudo-smart and definitely unpleasant. It is also silly beyond belief and creates an overpowering desire in the spectator to depart hastily for a more salubrious atmosphere. It is definitely not the kind of picture one can recommend.\\"Kipling and \\"It.\\"Without prejudging the merits of the controversy which, judging by these comments, is likely to be waged over \\"Knowing Men\\" as a realistic picture of English society, it may parenthetically be mentioned that Mrs. Elinor Glyn's laurels as the inventor of the term \\"It\\" as applied to sex-appeal have been torn from her brow by a correspondent who quotes from Mr. Rudyard Kipling's \\"Mrs. Bathurst\\" (in \\"Traffics and Discoveries\\") the following words used by a man in describing the charm of certain women:\\"It isn't beauty, so to speak, nor good talk, necessarily. It's just It.\\" \\"It,\\" adds the correspondent, \\"is too good to be pasted on to the passing fame of 'Three Weeks.'\\"Cinemas \\"for home consumption\\" are having a continually extending sale, but as a rule the apparatus at the disposal of the ordinary amateur is in the nature of a toy. A new field is, however, opening up for the professional maker of silent \\"shorts,\\" and this is found in the bars and lounges or saloons, or public houses, as they are called here. Quite a number of these establishments are showing their patrons short films free of charge, and one bold innovator in Sheffield has set apart a room accommodating about a hundred people, in which talkers are exhibited. It is not thought the experiment will be widely followed, seeing that the necessity of silence will interfere with \\"the feast of reason and the flow of soul\\" which landlords will expect from their customers in lieu of entrance charges. \\"Next orders\\" and \\"time, gentlemen, please,\\" shouted in the raucous voices of the waiters would sadly interfere with the mellifluous (?) records of the \\"mike.\\" LONDON FILM NOTES; \\"Elstree Calling,\\" British Reply to \\"Hollywood Revue\\" Is Disappointing An Experiment.

Deploring the ''destruction of the (McKim, Mead & White) firm's splendid hall in Jefferson's Rotunda,'' Mr. Reed declares that ''What had been a beautiful room embellished with a giant Corinthian order was replaced a decade or so ago with what can only be described as a surmise about what Jefferson had proposed.''

To make way for this monstrous and nonfunctional pantheon, White (or his firm) completely eliminated not only Jefferson's original central room on the upper floor but also the entire main floor below comprising three oval rooms and a free-form hall, a group widely regarded in the 19th century as America's most beautiful suite.

But then, if one had to imagine an archetypal, or fairy-tale, city, one might come up with something very much like this. Perhaps it is the manageable, small scale combined with the density of the past; perhaps the low arches and crooked streets and echoing cobblestones; but Cracow speaks of something close to the center -- not only of Europe but of the imagination.   By contemporary standards, Cracow is provincial in size -- it has a population of around 800,000 -- but it's a town with a grand history and vital traditions and an almost sensuous concentration of architectural beauty; a place confident of its idiosyncrasies, and its own, plentiful sufficiency.

In Italy it was called \\"First Communion\\" and, under that title, it won the grand prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1950. Neither title is particularly good.For the substance of this little frolic, in which Aldo Fabrizi is the star, is nothing more than the tangle into which a papa gets himself on a happy Easter morn. It seems that the new white dress his wife has ordered for their daughter to wear when she makes her first communion on this morning fails to arrive on time. So papa, a vain, hot-headed tradesman, after bullying everybody in his home, goes forth to collect the garment from the dressmaker a few blocks away. And the whole film is simply a recital of the squabbles and snarls into which he gets, on account of his nasty disposition, and the lesson he finally learns.If the farcical mix-ups and hurrahs were all that there was in this film, it would hardly be worth the distinction of a Venice festival prize. For, with all due respect to the performance that Mr. Fabrizi gives as the uncivil and vainglorious central character, it is pretty much commonplace farce—just a run-through of traffic tangles, street brawls and broad face-pushing in boisterous Latin style.But along toward the end of the picture the slapstick gives way to a flow of rather gentle and poignant intimations of the nice things in human characters—such as the fortitude of a neighboring father who won't sell the communion dress of his little girl, even though he is offered a lot of money, which he needs badly, by the arrogant man. And out of these intimations there emerges a soft, heart-warming sense of the fundamental decency of people, beside which bourgeois attitudes look cheap and mean.There is no wonder that the picture grows in stature. It was written and directed by the team that, a few years ago, delivered that charming little Italian comedy-drama, \\"Four Steps in the Clouds.\\" That it to say, it was written by Cesare Zavattini, who also wrote the scripts for many top Italian pictures, including \\"Shoe Shine\\" and \\"The Bicycle Thief\\"","excerpt":"and it was directed by Alessandro Blasetti, who has a sharp and delightful comic touch.In addition to Mr. Fabrizi, who is the paragon of a pompous oaf in the early part of the picture and of a piteous penitent at the end, the cast is adorned by Gaby Morlay as the fellow's long-suffering wife, Laura Gazzolo as a buxom housemaid and Ludmilla Dudarova as a delectable lady who lives across the way.It should be mentioned, however, that the dialogue in Italian is apparently full of good, juicy colloquial jabs that are obviously not done credit in the prosaic subtitles that are affixed.

Once again, decisions that may shape Poland's future were being made far from Warsaw - in Rome as in Moscow, where the Warsaw Pact countries met last week, and in Washington. President Reagan said the United States would be willing to ''turn back'' from some of the economic sanctions that the West has imposed if Poland acted on the Pope's call for free trade unions.

Nevertheless, there are now some signs that British studios are on the way to justify their existence, and show investors in English companies that something more than \\"hot air\\" may be expected from Elstree and Wembley. British International Studios at Elstree, by the way, lay claim to be the biggest film-making establishment in Europe, and nearly the largest in the world.John Court Appleby Thorpe, who is general production manager for this company, is one of those dauntless souls who have never been depressed by America's lead, especially in the development of audible films","excerpt":"and just at present he is in high feather because of both the number and variety of the works which have been completed at Elstree.\\"We asked for no quarter when the talker boom came,\\" said Mr. Thorpe, in a published interview this week, \\"and we were given none; but the result is we have not one film left on our shelves, and our profits on talking films will be at least 200 per cent more than our profits on silent films.Good News for Stockholders.This is, of course, very good news for shareholders in the company, and undoubtedly must go far to counteract the impressions produced by the news that \\"Blackmail,\\" for instance, which was hailed as a world-conquering effort, has been banned by Australia on the ground that it was not \\"up to antipodean standards,\\" and has, from all that one can learn, not been very widely booked in the United States. It is especially interesting to note that Mr. Thorpe, whose other work comprises \\"Under the Greenwood Tree,\\" very much after Thomas Hardy's novel, \\"The American Prisoner,\\" a version of an Eden Phillpotts story which has not set Dartmoor on fire, and some others which I am unable to characterize because I have had no opportunity of seeing them (nor has the public yet!), appears to have convinced his interviewer that \\"talking pictures are shedding their shackles\\" (which is at least a good alliterative phrase) \\"and will slowly, but surely, give the screen initiative to Britain.\\"Are we down-hearted? That was a slogan in the darkest days of the war; and it is a slogan in the British film world today. But on one occasion it was a case of America to the rescue against a common foe, and in the other instance the position is somewhat different.Film of Irishman's Play.Now, the outstanding feature of the past week or so has been the appearance in the category of prereleases of sound films which are described as British or all-British. One of these is \\"The Informer.\\" It is based on a play by an Irishman, Liam O'Flaherty. It was made by a German, Dr. Arthur Robison, and the two leading characters are played by that Hungarian actress, Miss Lya de Putti, and a Swede, Lars Hansen. Still it was mounted at Elstree, and surely that is enough to justify its description of British, for is not everything that comes from Hollywood American, even though an the international talents have been employed in production? Another of the pre-releases is \\"all British.\\" This one is entitled \\"The Devil's Maze,\\" and it is so entirely British—nay, even, so entirely English——that its producers must be acquitted of any charge of having considered the possibility of appeal to an international market.A Good British Production.\\"The Devil's Maze\\" is a good sound-film. It is based on a story by Mr. Mallock, which possesses many qualities of human interest, but its chief appeal lies in its scenes of fox hunting in the English shires. It is estimated that the capital investment in the sport of fox hunting in this country represents something like thirty million pounds; but the number of people interested in it, even from a spectacular point of view, assuredly does not run into astronomical figures, and judging by the size of the audience at the Marble Arch Pavilion the other night one was forced to the sad conclusion that it is not even a draw to many thousands of cinemagoers. From this (which is of course a sordid box-office) point of view it is rather a pity that \\"The Devil's Maze\\" does not make a more general appeal, for as an illustration of what British ability can do in the manufacture of a sound-film it is highly commendable. The dialogue was good, the sound effects were well modulated, and there were none of the eccentricities in the delineation of English life to which Hollywood's efforts in that direction have accustomed a captious world. Possibly, if the golden apples of cinema production were not in the Hesperides, but were to be plucked at home in each of the countries engaged in making films, \\"The Devil's Maze\\" will give an adequate crop, but with the industry being in its broadest aspect a competition for world markets this all-British sound-film is extremely limited in its appeal.Irish Rebellion Ignored.Liam O'Flaherty's \\"The Informer\\" is the so-called British film which is coupled with \\"The Devil's Maze\\" in the complimentary bouquets of the cinema critics. Here again, the point which forces itself most upon the attention is the fact that the British producer has his eyes turned inward rather than outward. We have not yet heard what Ireland may think of a picture which shows Dublin in at least as bad a light as some American films have shown Chicago and New York. The story as Mr. O'Flaherty told it was concerned with the Ireland of the days after the founding of the Free State. For reasons which it is difficult to understand the producers of the film have cut out all references to the rebellion during the war, and the result is that Dublin is presented as a city in which Irishmen take life both easily and often without even the justification of political animosities and rivalries. One reviewer puts it: \\"The Dublin of this film makes the Chicago of American films seem to be a heavenly place.\\" When one remembers the trouble in the United States in connection with the \\"Playboy of the Western World\\" one wonders what reception may be given the British film by the Irish-American populations of Boston and other cities.\\"The Hollywood Review\\" has had a very mixed reception here, but on the whole is more than likely to attract big houses than the more or loss British examples of sound-film production which are being shown here at the present moment.

Silvano Panizzut, owner of Silvano's, obviously takes great pride in his establishment. He is always on hand, greeting guests, making menu suggestions, fixing a drink or opening a bottle of wine, giving everything a warm and personal touch.

Riverhead: Four Charged in Fatal Beating"},{"year":"1935","title":"BY all odds the most talked-of film shown in London during the past month or so has been Paramount's production of \\"Lives of a Bengal Lancer.\\" A number of the scribes who waxed most enthusiastic found in it an argument for a glorification of British rule in India, but neither by its propagandism nor by an exact presentation of army life on the Northwest Frontier has \\"Bengal Lancer\\" attracted its knowledgeable audiences. It has caught the town by the sheer merit of its entertainment and technical excellence.The picture is being used as a flail to beat British producers with. No London studio has made a picture which, in the words of one commentator, has brought a British audience to its feet by the playing of \\"God Save the King\\" as Hollywood has now done for the second time in the course of two years, the other instance having been \\"Cavalcade.\\"The first of the series of Dickens sound films shown here came from a British studio, British International. \\"The Old Curiosity Shop\\" was the story selected, and a company of capable artists, headed by Ben Webster, was gathered together by Thomas Bentley, who directed, and who is an ardent student and admirer of the author. Mr. Bentley and his cast have caught the Dickensian atmosphere most successfully, but the development of the story is more in keeping with the slow-moving days of the stage coach than with the rapid motion of this era of airplanes.Almost synchronously with the trade showing of \\"Curiosity Shop\\" came the London presentation of the American version of \\"Great Expectations,\\" done by Universal. Despite Carl Laemmle's announcement on the program that the latter picture comes to the screen with the real Dickens flavor untouched, \\"Great Expectations\\" compares unfavorably with \\"The Old Curiosity Shop,\\" for in the American picture more of an effort has been made to bring the story into conformity with present-day requirements of alert audiences than Mr. Bentley attempted in his leisurely fashion.Charles Dickens's stories have, of course, long been recognized by amateur critics of British film production as providing the kind of wholly and truly English subject and scenario which the millions of cinemagoers of this country were waiting for","excerpt":"and L. Toeplitz, who recently came into the foreground as the head and front of an ambitious London organization with ample funds at its back, has been called over the coals for having gone outside this tight little island for a story for his first venture in this country, a picture called \\"The Dictator.\\" The scene is laid in the Court of Denmark in the eighteenth century. Clive Brook was engaged to play the chief male role and Miss Madeleine Carroll's beauty was enlisted for the part of a queen.One hundred thousand pounds sterling was spent on the production of \\"The Dictator,\\" which has been given two gala premieres, one in Paris and one in London, and negotiations for the presentation of it in New York are now in progress. Even the most kindly critics can do no more than say that \\"The Dictator\\" has been lavishly and splendidly produced. Neither Mr. Brook nor Miss Carroll aroused enthusiasm.Another recent British film, \\"Lorna Doone,\\" based on Black-more's thoroughly English novel, with its scenario in the West Country, has scored no more of a success on its London showing than did \\"The Dictator.\\" Cynics say that the choice of subject and scenario is not all the battle, and that until British producers realize that in the making of pictures the chief essential is not to be dull, Elstree will trail a long, long way behind Hollywood in the best selling markets of the word.What some British producers are doing with success is to turn out picture versions of stage plays and musical comedies in quite creditable fashion. Alexander Korda's experiences, though varied, in seeking entry into the American market are the envy of most of his competitors. Jack Buchanan recently completed a film adaptation of \\"Brewster's Millions, \\"which is specially designed for export to the United States, and Miss Gracie Fields has been prevailed upon to sign on the dotted line a contract under which she is to appear as star in four films to be completed before the end of 1936, one of them to be written by J. B. Priestley on an Anglo-American subject. Miss Fields contracts to go to the United States for part of the shooting of this picture, if required, and thereby earn a salary which is said to be higher than Greta Garbo's.

Perhaps because of this the young writer never seems surprised by the curious things people say to him. When he sets off to see the world, his mother says at the railroad station: \\"Please don't forget me. I've always been fond of you.\\" Wilhelm's response is to think that he'd like to comb his hair when he's on the train.Wilhelm is always too busy responding to his own thoughts to look squarely at others. Nor does he question the chance alliances that are more or less thrust on him as, in Wim Wenders's 1975 film, \\"The Wrong Move,\\" he moves across Germany collecting a very odd assortment of acquaintances.These include Laertes (Hans Christian Blech), a jovial, menacing old man","excerpt":"and Laertes's traveling companion, Mignon (Natassia Kinski), a nubile, sexually forthright young woman who sometimes stands on her head to say \\"thank you.\\" There are also Landau (Peter Kern), a poet, and Therese (Hanna Schygulla), a beautiful actress whom Wilhelm first sees from his train window as she passes in another train. When he encounters her the next day, on the street of a distant city, she suggests they make love, but Wilhelm is always Wilhelm. He politely declines because, as he explains, he's not ready for \\"a new person.\\"\\"The Wrong Move,\\" which opens today at the Harold Clurman Theater, is the fourth feature made by the talented young German director who has already been represented here by \\"The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,\\" \\"Alice in the Cities,\\" \\"Kings of the Road\\" and \\"The American Friend.\\"Like \\"The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,\\" which is as successful a screen adaptation of a nouveau roman as I've seen, \\"The Wrong Move\\" was written by Peter Handke, who seems to have taken the form and some of the characters' names from Goethe's \\"Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre,\\" first published in 1795-96 in four volumes divided into eight books.Though it is never lightheartedly funny, \\"The Wrong Move\\" is an essentially comic picture of the young, intensely self-absorbed, would-be writer, the sort of fellow who says one morning to a companion, quite seriously, \\"I intended to start writing today, but I dreamed so much last night it's impossible.\\" In this way once again Wilhelm spares himself the bother of getting down to a writer's business.Instead of writing Wilhelm drives across Germany with his mysterious friends, ever on the lookout for things to experience. There are occasional things to be experienced firsthand, as when the industrialist, who has put him up for the night, hangs himself the next afternoon. Mostly, though, Wilhelm's experiences are secondhand. They are his friends' remembered dreams and recollections of childhoods that may or may not be true.Truth, however, is not as important to Wilhelm as his reaction to whatever is happening or being said. There's a nice, lively moment late in the movie when Therese, who has been confiding to Wilhelm her troubles as an actress, realizes he hasn't been listening. \\"I was listening,\\" he says as she beats him furiously with one of his very thin manuscripts, \\"but I kept thinking I was losing writing time.\\"Unlike the anxiety of the goalie, whose alienation is part of the universal system of things, Wilhelm's anxiety is largely self-imposed, something he cultivates as if it were an educational tool. The movie, like Wilhelm, deals in heightened experience through vivid colors and in the amplification of small sounds, while (also like Wilhelm) it pays no attention to the feelings and emotions of others.\\"The Wrong Move,\\" an uncommonly beautiful film, was photographed by Robbie Muller, who has done all of Mr. Wenders's work, the grainy black-and-white \\"road\\" pictures as well as the elegant, eerie color movies.Mr. Vogler gives an extremely witty performance, being always dead-serious and impossibly assuming (by which I mean the opposite of unassuming), as a 20th-century version of an 18th-century German romantic. Also fine are Mr. Blech, Miss Kinski and the incomparable Hanna Schygulla, much more of whom can be seen currently in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's \\"The Marriage of Maria Braun.\\"\\"The Wrong Move\\" is not a film to be casually recommended, though. It lacks the narrative desperation that illuminate \\"The Goalie's Anxiety\\" and \\"The American Friend.\\" It is too chilly to be very involving. Yet it is another fascinating reminder of the very original work being done these days by Mr. Wenders and his German colleagues.

And Metro's remake of the comedy, which arrived at Loew's Criterion yesterday, is still a cheerful and occasionally bittersweet saga of that noted blabbermouth who very nearly wrecks the Fisher family of Philadelphia with kindness and advice. It is still an obvious yarn, whose exaggerations are excusable and whose humor is not abdominal but runs to chuckles. But despite its uneven pace, it is a light and amiable investigation of one of society's blights which has no delusions of grandeur.Aubrey Piper, as the Fishers point out, is \\"the big wind.\\" He is that railroad clerk who talks like he owns the Central Union. But he definitely and deeply loves Amy Fisher, whom he marries and who, in his own irresponsible manner, he tries to keep. Naturally the bills pile up and, naturally, Aubrey is certain things will pan out. If they don't and if Aubrey and his bride are forced to live with her folks, it's not really Aubrey's fault. He goes on being the brassy, undefeated \\"boy with the iron lung\\" whose mistakes have to be cleared up by the rest of the family. But in the end, the basically unselfish hero manages unwittingly to fix it so that the Fishers snag that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.Red Skelton, a comedian whose zany brand of humor has never completely devastated this observer, is surprisingly natural and funny as the well-meaning braggart. His characterization of Aubrey shows few evidences of the facial gymnastics to which he is heir, and adds up to a restrained and convincing portrayal. Marilyn Maxwell, as his understanding spouse Marjorie Main and George Cleveland, as the exasperated parents","excerpt":"and Lean Ames, Jacqueline White and Marshall Thompson, as the other harried members of the Fisher clan, are competent foils for Skelton, the show-off. \\"Success,\\" says our hero, \\"will never change me.\\" But it's likely a few people will recognize and appreciate his personification.

The manner in which the mystery is sustained is absorbing and the performances are, on occasion, bright and penetrating. However, the motivations of these fear-ridden characters seem ill-defined and superficial. The bizarre situations in which they are involved appear episodic and contrived.Director Henri Decoin has kept his story spinning in a setting as eye-catching and interesting as his uneasy cast. The occasion is the housewarming of an opulent Paris penthouse attended by the new owner, Michel Auclair, a young, venal and successful newspaper man, and the four women in his life. It is also made fairly clear that the railing of the penthouse terrace has been purposely loosened and that one of the party will die \\"accidentally.\\"Included among the anxious guests are Constance, M. Auclair's first wife, a lady who is artistic about ceramics and honestly critical of her ex-husband's ruthless tactics. Then there is his second wife, the shapely Vera, a grasping movie star, who wants a handsome sum before she will divorce him. There also is Cecile, the young, pretty and foolish boss' daughter, who is in an \\"interesting\\" condition and engaged to our designing hero","excerpt":"and Maggy, a well-connected widow, who is suspected of poisoning her husband and who now has eyes only for our enterprising newsman.M. Decoin develops a foreboding atmosphere and the members of his party contribute an occasional caustic characterization as they snipe at each other. As the story unfolds in a flashback (with English subtitles and some English narration, Danielle Darrieux, as M. Auclair's first wife, effectively emerges in the film's most sympathetic role. She is believably charming and poignant as the helpmeet who is both deeply in love but cognizant of her husband's consuming ambition and weakness.Despite an unexpected dénouement, M. Auclair's portrayal leaves something to be desired. He is simply a youthful, rather determined and suave gent, who does not come across as the devastating conniver and lady-killer he is supposed to be.As the grasping but fearful screen star, Corinne Calvet leaves no doubt that she has been nobly endowed by nature. Myriam Petacci cuts a shadowy figure as M. Auclair's mistress, and Lyla Rocco is decidedly decorative as his hard-drinking nubile fiancée.They have been revealingly accoutered by none other than Pierre Balmain. They should be the envy of their less fortunate distaff viewers. But all they actually provide is a slick, occasionally taut, but unconvincing entertainment.

Madame de Maintenon, the commoner who married the Sun King, saw to it that her house reflected her complex personality","excerpt":"and Maintenon today remains an eloquent comment on the way she made her way to the top.   The daughter of a noble, but impoverished and improvident, father, Francoise d'Aubigne, as she then was, survived on the strength of her wits. As the young wife of the old and crippled poet Paul Scarron, she managed to impress the most intellectually demanding people in Paris. As his penniless widow, she was sought for her conversation and admired for her discretion; that in turn led to her appointment as the governess of the King's illegitimate children. She soon followed her charges to court, where Louis XIV noticed her. But it took coolness and intelligence of a high order to attract his love. Part of Madame Scarron's strategy consisted in being as unlike Madame de Montespan, the reigning mistress, as possible.   When Madame de Montespan decided she must have her own house in the country, she commissioned Mansart to build her a splendid castle at Clagny, just outside Versailles. That sort of self-advertisement was not Madame Scarron's style; so when Louis XIV gave her the marquisate of Maintenon, he chose an estate 30 miles from court.

If the bulb still won't light, the next logical step is to change the plug at the end of the lamp cord. This takes only minutes if you use one of the snap-on plugs, since they can be connected to the old wire without having to strip off the insulation. Cut the lamp cord off about an inch from the old plug, then push the cut end of the electric cord into the opening on the side of the new plug. A small plastic lever at the top is then snapped shut to automatically make the connection. Prongs inside the plug pierce the insulation and make contact with the wires on the inside.

What he wanted to know, in general terms, was whether the United States has the equivalent of London's thriving and variegated early music scene","excerpt":"and more specifically, whether it would be feasible to bring the English Concert across the water for an American tour.   Eventually, he found a pair of American managers sympathetic to the original instruments cause; and they, in turn, arranged for Mr.  Pinnock's debut harpsichord recital, tomorrow evening at the Metropolitan Museum, and for a tour that will bring a scaled-down (eight player) version of the English Concert to the Museum on May 6. At the time of his visit, though, Mr. Pinnock was less than sanguine about the vitality of America's early music world.

At the time, he appeared to be helping an obsessed President prosecute a war of no real consequence to the security of the United States. Millions of loyal citizens concluded that the war was a militarily unnecessary and politically futile effort to prop up a corrupt Government that could neither reform nor defend itself.    Through all the bloody years, those were the facts as they appeared on the surface. Therefore, only one argument could be advanced to clear President Johnson and Mr. McNamara, his Secretary of Defense, of the charge of wasting lives atrociously. That was the theory that they possessed superior knowledge, not available to the public, that the collapse of South Vietnam would lead to regional and perhaps world domination by the Communists","excerpt":"and moreover, that their superior knowledge was so compelling it rendered unreliable and untrue the apparent facts available to even the most expert opponents of the war.

The obstacles to a sensible policy remain enormous. First, neither side understands the other well. Confronted with the Russian tradition of secrecy and authoritarianism, we tend to see the Soviet Union both as a military monster and as an economy on the verge of collapse. Confronted with an overabundance of information about the United States, the Kremlin resorts to explanations in which Marxism, even tempered, still plays an unhelpful role","excerpt":"and Moscow is often slow in understanding the significance of American events. Only now does Moscow seem to recognize that Ronald Reagan is not Richard M. Nixon - just when there are signs that some of Mr. Reagan's original positions can be modified in order to accommodate reality. Second, each superpower is intensely self-centered and suspicious of the other. Each tends to interpret every move of the other as something aimed at itself and fails to consider the effects of its own acts or statements on the policies of the other.  Moscow still finds it difficult to understand the effect that the policies it pursued in Africa from 1975 to 1977 had on the deterioration of detente, and the huge role that the invasion of Afghanistan had in bringing about the return to an American hard line.

Another acquisition at roughly the same time -- a five-foot Yamaha that had belonged to the singer Carmen McRae -- made the Jazz Gallery one of the very few clubs in the city with two good pianos.

Mr. Perahia is, of course, one of the most admired pianists of his generation, and he fully deserves his reputation, but one does wish that he occasionally would unbend, relax, get a bit more personality into his flawless playing.

Over the last four decades I have held numerous unpaid leadership positions in Jewish and secular organizations -- including a hospital, a college and a cemetery, but not, I must confess, a co-op board -- and none was as time consuming or aggravating as my synagogue presidency.

The Lowly President"},{"year":"1991","title":"'Rocky Horror' to 'Queen'   From Henry James to a follow-up to \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\\"    That's the course Michael White, the producer, intends to follow in the coming year.    Right now, though, Mr. White is most visible as the executive producer of \\"The Pope Must Die,\\" the imported comedy about an obscure Italian priest who becomes Pope David I through a clerical error and nearly brings the Roman Catholic Church to ruin.    \\"I've had this tradition of being very involved with England's comic life over the last 25 years,\\" said Mr. White, who lays claim not to discovering Monty Python but to turning the group professional by putting it on the London and New York stage in a hit revue called \\"Cambridge Circus.\\" \\"At that point they were all going to be lawyers and doctors and accountants,\\" Mr. White said. But after London and New York, \\"they liked the taste of comedy.\\"    In recent years, Mr. White has been working with a group called the Comic Strip, which he described as \\"eight loosely affiliated young actors and actresses in England who have been doing 30-minute films for the BBC for the last six years with considerable success.\\" Among the actors was Robbie Coltrane, who stars in \\"The Pope Must Die.\\" The group, Mr. White said, was founded by Peter Richardson, who directed the film","excerpt":"and Mr. Richardson and his collaborator, Pete Richens, wrote the screenplay.    \\"It always appeals to me to take something very serious and make it into a joke,\\" said Mr. White, who is not chuckling over the current state of comedy. \\"I'm troubled by the fact that so much is unadventurous. When one thinks back, which one has to, to people like Lenny Bruce, there doesn't seem to be anyone around with his kind of razor edge.\\"    In the fall in England, Mr. White expects to be at work on \\"Turn of the Screw,\\" the Henry James ghost story about two children haunted by a couple of servants. Rusty Lemorande, who wrote \\"Electric Dreams,\\" is to direct, from his own screenplay, Mr. White said, and the cast includes Patsy Kensit, Janet Suzman, Julian Sands and Martin Kemp.    And early next year, Mr. White, who co-produced \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\\" hopes to be at work on \\"The Revenge of the Old Queen,\\" a musical written by Richard O'Brien, who wrote the 1975 horror film send up that has become a cult favorite.    \\"It's in the same style as the other one,\\" Mr. White said. \\"It has reflections of the past in it.\\"  Intimate Competition    Everyone in movies has to face the competition. But in a few weeks, Mary Agnes Donoghue will be competing with herself.    On Wednesday, Touchstone Pictures plans to release \\"Paradise,\\" a film written and directed by Miss Donoghue. On Sept. 27, Touchstone also plans to release \\"Deceived,\\" based on Miss Donoghue's screenplay.    \\"Paradise,\\" starring Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, is an American version of the poignant 1987 French film \\"Le Grand Chemin.\\" In it, a little boy comes into the lives of a couple who are being torn apart as they struggle to accept the accidental death of their 3-year-old son.    \\"Deceived\\" stars Goldie Hawn and John Heard in the story of a New York book editor who discovers when her husband dies that his identity was a fake.    \\"Paradise\\" is the directing debut of Miss Donoghue, whose writing credits include such films as \\"Beaches,\\" which starred Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey, and \\"The Buddy System,\\" which starred Richard Dreyfuss and Susan Sarandon.    \\"I think every writer's lament is that you envision something in a script, and when someone else directs it, they bring what they see to it; and you feel frustrated because you don't see exactly what it is you wanted to see,\\" Miss Donoghue said.    Adapting a French film for an American production, she said, is very difficult. \\"Americans think differently from the French. There is a kind of seriousness about Americans, a lack of sophistication on a certain level. People who have been through wars on their territory have a different attitude toward life. I wanted to write about people who had suffered a tragedy and were trying to find a way to live again. It's not something you get over. And they never get to eat those fabulous meals you always see in French movies.\\"    With her first directing stint behind her, Miss Donoghue said: \\"I discovered it's not nearly as easy as the writer in me thought it was. I think most writers are infuriated when they see things change. There was a point where I was like a schizophrenic. The director would be frustrated with the writer for not having written a scene a certain way, for having missed a certain point. What I think is fantastic is to be able to do both.\\"    Miss Donoghue, whose husband of 15 years is the writer Christopher Robbins, the author of the book \\"Air America,\\" said the idea for \\"Deceived\\" came to her this way: \\"You're sitting there at night and look over at your husband or your wife and think: Who is this person?    \\"I was fascinated by the idea of having a middle-class safe existence, predictable; and then certain events take place that let you know that you know nothing about your own life and the people in it. It's about betrayal at its most profound.\\"  Behind the Scenes    Ginger Rogers, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Tony Randall and Liv Ullmann are among the stars who are to appear in the three-part \\"Silver Screen\\" series this fall and winter at the 92d Street Y, where the host will be John Springer, the longtime publicity agent, author and producer.

Based on a one-act play, \\"The Dock Brief,\\" that has been seen in this country on television, the film seems a slight thing for two such eminent actors, but there lies the trick in British films.It is nothing more than a long dialogue — cleverly enlarged upon and staged—between a meek little man accused of murdering his eternally cheerful wife and the ponderous and dull-witted barrister assigned by the court to defend him. Mr. Attenborough plays the former, Mr. Sellers the latter, of course. And through it all they digress on occasions to play supplementary roles.That is to say, when the barrister is glibly describing the defense — the brilliant, adroit legal maneuvering — he envisions for his client while they are in his cell, the scene is often deftly expanded to embrace the courtroom as the barrister fancies it.In these fancies, Mr. Sellers not only appears as the barrister, suave and triumphant in his handling, but he also appears as a tongue-tied police doctor whom the barrister gets on the witness-stand. Mr. Attenborough also archly mimics the presiding justice, the foreman of the jury, a member of the public and several witnesses. In each of their side impersonations, the two actors are nimble and droll.But it is as their basic characters that they notably excel — Mr. Attenborough diffident and humble, soggy in appearance and attitude, like one of those lukewarm boiled potatoes that you dredge up in a boarding-house stew","excerpt":"and Mr. Sellers affectedly pompous, trying to put on the manner and air of an elegant London barrister and always being the humbug and fraud.The humor is in the fumbling discourse, the clumsy clichés by which these two expose their pathetically dull backgrounds and their horribly middle-class minds.\\"The law's a tricky business,\\" Mr. Sellers sagely observes, and Mr. Attenborough, after some cogitation on that weighty observation, replies, with the profundity of a pundit, \\"It is a bit chancey, yes.\\"But the funniest concept in the picture is the notion that a man should find cheerfulness so boring that he'd commit murder to get rid of a cheerful wife. That is made robustly amusing, thanks to some splendid help from Beryl Reid as the buxom, blowzy and perpetually laughing wife, and from David Lodge as a boarder who joins in her taste for practical jokes.Altogether this little item, directed by James Hill, provides a good second-class excursion in the realm of character comedy. Screen: 'Trial and Error' at Beekman:Sellers Plays Lawyer in British Comedy Attenborough Portrays Cheerful-Wife Killer"},{"year":"1990","title":"A Forster Adaptation    Long before Margaret Thatcher learned that Britain's relationship with the Continent can be fraught with drama, fine writers were exploring the consequences of that particular cultural clash.    So the English film maker Charles Sturridge -- perhaps best known as the director of the acclaimed television version of Evelyn Waugh's \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" and the film version of Waugh's \\"Handful of Dust\\" -- can be credited with a neat sense of timeliness.    That's because Mr. Sturridge has just finished filming \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread,\\" based on E. M. Forster's first novel -- a black comedy about an English woman's trip to Italy and her \\"unsuitable\\" marriage to a handsome young Italian.    \\"It's a story about how the English behave abroad,\\" Mr. Sturridge said, \\"in particular how badly they behave abroad. It's Forster's first book, written when he was 24, shortly after his own first trip to Italy, and it tells, really, of the experience of a group of young people, of moving outside their own rather small and suburban existence in England and into what for them is the new and sometimes frightening, sometimes comic world of Europe.\\"    The cast includes Helena Bonham Carter, Rupert Graves, Giovanni Guidelli, Judy Davis and Helen Mirren","excerpt":"and Mr. Sturridge, who is now in post- production on the film, shot it everywhere -- from San Gimignano outside Siena in Tuscany, to Rome and London.    \\"What interested me about it,\\" Mr. Sturridge said of the book, \\"was that of all Forster's novels, this, his first, seems to express most simply and, in a sense, most purely, the ideas that were to go through all the six novels he was to write.    \\"The phrase that was later to become the best-known expression of his ideal was 'only connect,' \\" Mr. Sturridge said, explaining that the words were an abbreviated form of the idea \\"only connect the prose and the passion.\\"    He said \\"only connect\\" was shorthand for a theme that runs through most of Forster's writing, \\"which was the collision of the cool or even cold Northern temperament and the warm energy of Europe or, later, India, both of which were based on his own travels.\\"    Mr. Sturridge said he hoped to have \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\" ready by the spring, perhaps in time for the Cannes film festival, where cultures also meet, and sometimes clash.  Maureen O'Hara Returns     Nineteen years after she went into retirement, Maureen O'Hara is back in business -- at work on her 56th film.    So what's new?    \\"There's new ways of doing things, but there's nothing new,\\" said the Irish-born and still red-haired star of such films as \\"How Green Was My Valley,\\" \\"The Black Swan,\\" \\"Miracle on 34th Street,\\" \\"Sitting Pretty\\" \\"Rio Grande,\\" \\"The Quiet Man\\" and \\"The Long Gray Line.\\"    \\"They work different hours. They work long night hours. Basically, makeup, the hairdressing, the camera, the film in the camera are all pretty much the same, except the film today is more sensitive.    \\"The methods are the same. You still have to learn your lines. You still have to act.\\"    Miss O'Hara, who began her film career in 1938, has been spending the autumn in Chicago, playing the role of Rose Muldoon in \\"Only the Lonely,\\" a 20th Century Fox bittersweet romantic comedy written and directed by Chris Columbus (\\"Home Alone\\").    \\"Well,\\" Miss O'Hara said of Rose, \\"she's an Irish mother -- strong, outspoken, sometimes very mean, sometimes very funny and sometimes very sad, who is absolutely determined to hang onto her son and not let him get married.\\"    The son, Danny Muldoon, played by John Candy, is a good-hearted cop whose partner, Sal, is played by James Belushi; Ally Sheedy plays Theresa Luna, Danny's love, the shy, withdrawn daughter of a mortician. Anthony Quinn, who has appeared in four other films with Miss O'Hara, plays the Muldoon family's amorous next-door neighbor.    Miss O'Hara said that when Mr. Columbus finally managed to track her down, in part through her brother, the producer Charles Fitzsimons, who read the script, she agreed to accept the role.    Miss O'Hara said of Rose Muldoon, \\"She was a wonderfully tough, strong, nasty, mean, totally diverse character; and she was the same age as me, so how can you turn that down? She's supposed to be 65. I'm a little bit older, and I'm not going to tell you how old.

CONCERT: NEW ORCHESTRA OF BOSTON IN TULLY HALL"},{"year":"1954","title":"THERE are no people like show people, as Irving Berlin says. That's a point the show people of Hollywood have been struggling for years to make. Now a major success in that direction is achieved by Twentieth Century-Fox in \\"There's No Business Like Show Business,\\" which slammed into the Roxy last night at a gala première for the benefit of the Actors Fund.Here at last it is demonstrated, in the full bloom of color and CinemaScope—and with the help, it must quickly be acknowledged, of some of Mr. Berlin's better songs—that the people who work in show business are a brash and irrepressible breed, from whom sentiment flows like maple syrup and to whom restraint is as foreign as a gnu. And if anyone raises feeble protest that this has been shown before, we hasten to add that it has never—but never!—been shown on such a scale.In a size and with a lavishness of production that puts in the distant shade such a show as their own previous frolic with Berlin music, \\"Alexander's Ragtime Band,\\" the Fox people are spreading the story of a vaudeville family across the screen as though it were the Cohans, Foys and Rooneys all wrapped up in a big Ziegfeld-Carroll revue.They are putting this family through the paces of young love, old love, failure, success, separation, reunion, malnutrition, even of one son's entrance into the priesthood—all but death. And they are doing it all to Berlin music, as though the only songs these people latched on to were the songs of the dean of Tin Pan Alley—which, considering their quality, is all right, too.From the opening scene in which Dan Dailey and Ethel Merman, who beget a thespian brood that turns out to be Mitzi Gaynor, Donald O'Connor and Johnnie Ray, start off with a raggy shuffle to \\"When That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves For Alabam',\\" the whole thing is one long gorgeous wallow in fantastic style and sentiment. Song and story are wrapped and rolled together for 117 minutes, wall to wall.What they like, they repeat. Mr. O'Connor does a drunk scene early in the film—you know, kid coming home with a snoot-full to shock his parents. A comedy routine. So they do it again when Mr. O'Connor thinks he has been jilted by Marilyn Monroe, a blond, baby-faced night-club singer who complicates the uneven tenor of the family's way.Likewise, the family is presented in a splurge of \\"Alexander's Ragtime Band\\" as soon as the children are all grown up so they can take their appropriate turns. Mr. Dailey and Miss Merman do it \\"beer-hall,\\" Mr. O'Connor does it with a Scottish burr, Miss Gaynor sings and dances it like a Frenchie and Mr. Ray shouts it from the top of his head. This song, with all of them joined together, is repeated at the end.Some things are better than others. Miss Gaynor and Miss Merman are fine in a song-skit called \\"A Sailor's Not a Sailor Till a Sailor's Been Tattooed.\\" As a matter of fact, Miss Gaynor and Miss Merman are the most agreeable items in the show. When it comes to spreading talent, Miss Gaynor has the jump on Miss Monroe, whose wriggling and squirming to \\"Heat Wave\\" and \\"Lazy\\" are embarrassing to behold.Embarrassing, too, is the build-up of Mr. Ray's becoming a priest, which he explains as \\"a change of booking.\\" Says he: \\"You've got to admit, the Church has had a mighty long run.\\" And when he wails an evangelistic number, \\"If You Believe,\\" which contains the horrendous line \\"I'm making no promises to the doubting Thomases,\\" your flesh is likely to crawl.But, then, Mr. O'Connor is spanking in a dance to \\"A Boy Chases a Girl,\\" and, however you view Mr. Dailey, he's a hoofer down to the ground.So that's how it is with this picture—a huge, sprawling, sentimental show. Lots of laughing and crying. Lots of singing. There are no people like show people, indeed.

For one thing, many of the book's pages could have been better used to show photographs and to provide details about projects only mentioned in passing, rather than to describe Doisneau's very static life (he inhabited the same suburban apartment from 1937 on and almost never traveled abroad). Most important, Mr. Hamilton eschews any real discussion of Doisneau's frequent use of models, actors and mises-en-scne in order to re-create scenes of daily life.  His world-famous 1950 photograph \\"Baiser de l'H/tel de Ville,\\" for instance, was far from being documentary; it was staged.

Mr. Hare was also instrumental in many planning and zoning issues in Cornwall. He was an environmentalist long before the environment became an issue. For example, he collected DDT residue samples from the brooks in Cornwall in the 1950's as part of a study that led to restrictions on its use. His long life is best summarized by his love of the land. It kept him continuously involved in conservation groups. He was a founder of the Housatonic Valley Association, and served it as a director and president for many years. In his work with the Association, he was a leader in the preservation of many tracts of land along the Housatonic, including, for example, several miles of the river's undeveloped west bank and the adjoining ridge from Cornwall to Kent. During his lifetime, Mr. Hare was a reporter, playwright, producer, poet, and painter. He wrote and directed plays for the famous Barter Theatre in Virginia during its heyday in the late 40's. He was a conscientious objector at a time when very few men were.

Quite honestly, so far, in my own head, I don't feel it's a comparison. We started ours before they did theirs, so it's not one of those made-for-TV copies.''

It is life, far more than it is fiction, which has freighted the Filmarte's \\"That They May Live\\" with its burden of terror and sadness, making it one of the most horrifying and poignant films we have seen. For \\"That They May Live,\\" made eighteen months ago in France, is a tortured cry for peace and the brotherhood of man","excerpt":"and now the world is at war and the film cannot even be shown in France: its message is dangerous propaganda.Were there no war, all threat of war averted, Abel Gance's film, paradoxically, would have been mere theatrical fiction, not always too successful as that. Seen through the smoke-haze of today as a naked failure, a film whose message went unheard and cannot now be heard by those who speak its language, it stands, not alone as a tragedy on film, but as a tragedy of life. And in that lie its poignance, its bitterness, its real significance for those who will be brave enough to see it.And it will take hardihood, or the self-punishing courage of the sensitive, to face the drama of torment and disillusion Mr. Gance and his case have thrust upon the Filmarte's screen. Theirs is the story of war, of the last war and the one that (when they filmed it) was yet to come. It is the story of a soldier of Verdun who swears, before the mud and bones and blood of his comrades, that he will keep the memory of their sacrifice alive, will never let another war sweep the world. And when the new war looms, and all his appeals to reason, decency and humanity are unheeded, he returns to Verdun and summons the war dead from their graves to march against the living.Gance has directed it eloquently, unsparingly. His scenes of battle are hideous. His march of the dead can almost be smelled. His players, from Victor Francen's tragic enemy of war down to the least of the poilus, have matched his somber mood with performances of dignity, sincerity and depth. Pierre van Paassen's dialogue translations are laconic and forceful. The editing is less smooth, but never so abrupt in its transitions as seriously to affect the even running of the central theme. Somehow these questions of technique have no importance here; not because the film is above them, but because life is.

By Ted Morgan.  Illustrated. 607 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $22.50.   Of the making of books about Winston Churchill there appears to be no end, although the flood tide has receded somewhat from eight years ago, when Nov. 30, 1974, marked the 100th anniversary of his birth.  The official Churchill biography continues its magisterial way forward. It now consists of 4,449 pages of text and 12,803 pages of further documents in companion volumes. Churchill's son, Randolph, wrote the first two volumes, taking the story to 1914. Since Randolph's death in 1968, Martin Gilbert has carried on with the task and has brought the story up to 1939 with Volume 5, which appeared in 1977. Last fall, under Gilbert's editorship, two further companion volumes of documents were issued.

A graduate of Milton Academy in Milton, MA, she moved to Corning with her husband in 1921. Their marriage lasted six months shy of sixty years. In the late 1950's, The Herald Tribune bestowed the name ''L'Ambassadrice Souriante'' (the Smiling Ambassadress) to Mrs. Houghton. The paper also referred to her as ''the undisputed First Lady of the Diplomatic Corps and of the American Colony in Paris.''

''She had the endearing capacity for laughter in happy times, contagious; in times of stress, lightening the load.'' ''When someone of her stature passes away, we have to say a generation is going,'' said Thomas P. Dimitroff, a noted Corning historian. ''She was a lady in the best sense of the word.''

It is for the most part a lethargic pictorial story with several unconvincing episodes, but the stellar player, Winifred Westover, former wife of William S. Hart, the two-gun man of silent films, commands serious attention through the sincerity of her portrayal of Lummox, the Swedish drudge, whose life is a series of bitter disappointments with selfish, thoughtless, unkind and unfair employers.Miss Westover has not appeared in pictures for nine years, but her performance in this current film would lead one to presume that she has not permitted the time to pass without studying acting. There is a vague suggestion of symbolism in this narrative, as it has been directed by Mr. Brenon, and for that reason the studied movements of the participants, including at times the acting of Miss Westover, may be overlooked. With the exception of Miss Westover's careful and commendable impersonation, however, the characters are more often than not like puppets at the beck and call of the director, an impression which is strengthened by the halting and recitative delivery of their lines.Ben Lyon is never really human as Rollo Farley, the fashionably attired young poet who during inebriated moments is inspired by the family servant, Lummox, to pen a sonnet on \\"Feet deep-rooted into the soil,\\" when he sees the drudge in her bare feet out in the yard. Another of his effusions is suggested by Lummox's laconicism. This one, which is supposed to be a master-piece, is something about \\"A tower of silence under the sea.\\" It is this rhyming reprobate who is the father of Lummox's child, a fact which does not cause him any misgivings.The real name of the drudge is Bertha Oberg. She is called a \\"lummox\\" by Chita, a wayward girl who is taken in charge by the Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Children after Bertha calls up that society. This act was prompted by Bertha's wish to save Chita","excerpt":"and often it happens this servant's good deeds bring misfortune to her door.Bertha is prevailed upon to give her infant son to a wealthy couple, and in the course of her dreary existence, years after, she seeks employment in this family, only to be told that she is too late for the job. She is befriended by one of the male servants in this house, who tells her about her boy, how tall he is, how he plays, and subsequently that the foster parents have decided to take him to Europe to have him taught the piano, the desire to become a musician having been inspired through a concertina which Bertha anonymously sends to the child.In one of the closing sequences, which brings the story up to date, Bertha observes a poster on Carnegie Hall, and for some reason or other she knows that the pianist who is scheduled to play is her son. She buys a standing-room ticket and leans against the wall, listening intently to the notes struck by the handsome young musician. It is perhaps here that Miss Westover does her outstanding acting, the expression on her care-worn countenance being one of mingled pain and admiration.At the end there is a pleasing touch, for Bertha, who has learned from agencies that she is not wanted as a servant because of her advanced age, enters a baker's shop kept by a kindly old widower who has several children. The woman who has been crushed for more than Twenty years is glad to be asked by the father to come and live in his home and look after his motherless ???rood.Miss Westover has a placid face and her fair hair is coiled on the top of her head for this rôle. As Bertha she is sluggish in her movements and her only sign of satisfaction is a half-hearted smile. As the years roll by, Bertha becomes even slower in her actions and not until the end does she really look cheerful. Her message of spiritual goodness fails, that is until she comes to the last few scenes.Myrtle Stedman, who will be remembered years ago for her fine performance as \\"The Famous Mrs. Fair,\\" does well with a minor rôle in this current piece of work. William Collier Jr. figures in one of the episodes as a man whose wife can't see eye to eye with his mother. Dorothy Janis plays the indomitable and, afterward, penitent Chita.

Compiled and Edited, With an Introduction, by Elliott Mossman.  Translated by Elliott Mossman and Margaret Wettlin.  Illustrated. 365 pp. New York: A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book.  Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $19.95.\\n\\nTHIS splendid book, excellently translated and edited and handsomely turned out, is an unexpected gift, a work of art salvaged from the physical and spiritual ruins of terrible years. Its rescue is largely due to Olga Freidenberg, who managed to save most of the letters and to preserve some cherished memories in a journal from which Elliott Mossman quotes liberally and which he describes as ''a retrospective diary of her life, composed in her last years.'' In essence, this collection, a historical and literary document of the first importance, is a dual self-portrait, all unconsciously drawn, by two gifted, courageous people, whose story adds a heroic chapter to the tragic annals of our century.\\n\\nBoris Pasternak and Olga Freidenberg were cousins. Their fathers, Leonid Pasternak and Mikhail Freidenberg, had had known each other since their boyhood in Odessa. Leonid's sister, Ann, married Mikhail, and later, when the Freidenbergs settled in St. Petersburg and the Pasternaks in Moscow, they exchanged frequent visits and spent summers together.

Entrances at 81st Street and Central Park West and at 79th Street at Fifth Avenue, (212)539-8750.    Broadway    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy, Elaine May, mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.(Ben Brantley)    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars, Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50) Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)    'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' The debate about evoking the proper measurements of humor and pathos in the plays of Anton Chekhov is settled evenly if dubiously in Scott Zigler's production for the Atlantic Theater Company: It fails more or less equally at eliciting laughter and tears (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DRUMSTRUCK' The noisy novelty at Dodger Stages, is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating","excerpt":"and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, garment district, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' When the eccentric millionaire Harry Thaw shot and killed the famed architect Stanford White on the roof of Madison Square Garden almost a century ago, the subsequent trial of the century -- the first of many in the 20th -- was a perfect storm of celebrity scandal. Don Nigro's ''My Sweetheart's the Man in the Moon,'' recounts the sensational events with nuance and admirable research, but the passionless production unfortunately has the whiff of the whiff of Masterpiece Theater (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444.( Zinoman)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Midtown, (212)719-1300.(Isherwood)    'PEOPLE ARE LIVING THERE' This unrewarding Athol Fugard play benefits from some rewarding performances by its four actors. O'Mara Leary is Milly, who on her 50th birthday has been dumped by her boyfriend, and tries to keep her spirits up by recruiting some pals to join her in what turns out to be the worst birthday party ever (1:30). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.( Genzlinger)    * 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' Alan Ayckbourn's 67th play, a minor-key comedy about six Londoners leading lives of quiet desperation, is rueful, funny, touching and altogether wonderful. Sir Alan's flawless cast amplifies the emotional impact of his writing in variously subtle and hilarious ways, while respecting the depth in his literary spareness (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)    'UNSUSPECTING SUSAN' Celia Imrie stars as a snobbish Englishwoman in this funny, engaging (mostly) and tragic one-woman show written by Stewart Permutt. Ms. Imrie's character frets about her troubled son, living in London with a charming man, but doesn't begin to grasp how worried she should really be (1:10). Part of Brits Off Broadway. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. ( Gates)    Off Off Broadway    'BIG TIMES' Did you hear the one about the three actresses who wrote themselves a play? The punchline is this sweet, slender homage to the glory days of vaudeville, complete with goofy jokes, gags, and good music by the Moonlighters: kids are as likely to enjoy it as adults. Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. (Anne Midgette)    * 'DISPOSABLE MEN' James Scruggs, who wrote and performed this collection of character pieces, engages issues of race in the button-pushing satirical style that Spike Lee was aiming for (yet failed to pull off) in his film ''Bamboozled.'' This multimedia show compares the way African-American men are portrayed in the media to images of monsters in classic horror films like ''Frankenstein'' and ''King Kong'' (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212)868-4444.( Zinoman)    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101.(Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10).

Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising soufflé of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100, closing on Sunday. ( Isherwood)    'FLAT' This happily crass send-up of a BBC family drama is perfectly pitched for fans nostalgic for the self-parodying vulgarity of the sit-com ''Married With Children.'' Twelve episodes, quick scenes, stock characters and an opening montage sequence with a jingle that will lodge itself in your cranium, like it or not (1:00). Part of the Moral Values Festival. Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'HECUBA' Revenge is a dish served at room temperature in the intelligent but passionless production starring Vanessa Redgrave. Ms. Redgrave intriguingly brings forth the cool strategist inside the battered woman. But if we can admire this abject figure's salvaged aplomb, we rarely get a visceral sense of the despair and the rage at injustice that make the character such a compelling one (1:45). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, (718)636-4100, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'JACKSON'S WAY' Thirty-one-year-old Will Adamsdale isn't so much a comedian as a veritable wizard; a virtuoso of the transcendently absurd. Like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, he spins a wacky world of increasingly bizarre nonsense out of thin air, creating an exquisitely idiosyncratic worldview that is as funny as it is wonderfully weird, all in the guise of being a life coach named Chris John Jackson, inventor of the motivational technique (1:15).

In a role he has been playing over half a century, Hal Holbrook delivers a performance that is perhaps most remarkable for the energy it derives from a studied languor. Mr. Holbrook's Twain is an exhilarating master of theatrical passive aggression, while Twain's observations about corrupt journalists, politicians and religious fanatics remain soberingly relevant (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street (212)307-4100, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'MARATHON 2005, SERIES C' Horton Foote, the Chekhov of the South, tries something different with his gothic depression-eratale ''The One-Armed Man,'' the highlight of the third series of the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual collection of short plays, which always features a few wonderful pleasures. Along with Mr. Foote's chilling drama is Craig Lucas's shrewd portrait of a troubled woman, ''Your Call is Important,'' which plays on, among other things, New Yorker's neurosis about country life, and two minor pieces by Kate Long and Romulus Linney (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101), closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'SENECA'S OEDIPUS' In the new production of Seneca's ''Oedipus'' by the Theater by the Blind, the iconic story of the king of Thebes who unknowingly murders his father and marries his mother is performed in modern dress. The poet Ted Hughes's masterly 1968 adaptation is vividly alive, contemporary and shocking (1:30). Mint Space, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Honor Moore)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that ultimately pays off with some great laughs. This 1773 comedy mocks the London upper class's snobbery, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Presnyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday.(Brantley)    'THE WHORE OF SHERIDAN SQUARE' Michael Baron has written and directed this merry tribute to Charles Ludlam, who died of AIDS at 44, cutting short one of the most influential careers in downtown theater. For many downtown theatergoers, this silly -- or should I say, ridiculous -- dramatization of the life of Ludlam will be a nostalgic kick, like bumping into an old friend who you haven't seen in a long time (1:50). La MaMa, E.T.C., the Club, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)475-7710, closing on Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D' (PG, 94 minutes) There's a reason that children aren't allowed to vote, drive or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape their dream worlds into coherent and compelling stories -- a task the director Robert Rodriguez (''El Mariachi,'' ''Sin City'') also fails to accomplish in this muddled quest narrative based on characters and themes created by his 7-year-old son, Racer Max. (Dana Stevens)    * 'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left wing and bohemian, the other right wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)    'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best part of Ron Howard's ingratiating, Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism.(A.O. Scott)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    '5x2' (R, 90 minutes, in French) A couple's relationship unravels backward, from divorce through the birth of their child to their first meeting. Interesting, but chilly. (Scott)    'HEIGHTS' (R, 93 minutes) In its aspirations, design and worldview, ''Heights'' resembles a number of other films about cozily connected souls, a soap-operatic subgenre that might be called We Are the World. Everybody hurts, as Michael Stipe likes to sing, but people in ''Heights'' seem to hurt more or at least spend a lot of time nursing that hurt in brooding silence and noisy confrontation. (Dargis)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)    'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)    * 'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    * 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) About a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    'THE LONGEST YARD' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In this crummy remake of the 1974 film of the same title, Adam Sandler stars as the former N.F.L. quarterback Paul Crewe, who years earlier was booted out of the league for shaving points and is now charged with leading a team of prisoners against a team of guards. In the original film, directed with seriocomic facility by Robert Aldrich, Crewe was played by Burt Reynolds with effortless charm and the tightest pants this side of Tony Orlando. The Aldrich version was recently released on DVD and makes for a nice evening in. (Dargis)    'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo -- expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's cleareyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Stevens)    * 'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    'WAGING A LIVING' and 'ROSEVELT'S AMERICA' (No rating, 85 and 25 minutes) An eye-opening, often heartbreaking documentary tracking four members of the working poor in the Northeast and California. Roger Weisberg's feature is accompanied by his short film, ''Rosevelt's America,'' a vérité profile of the Liberian refugee Rosevelt Henderson.(Jeannette Catsoulis)    Film Series    HANNA SCHYGULLA (through June 30) The Museum of Modern Art concludes its 11-film retrospective of the work of Ms. Schygulla, the multi-award-winning German actress. On Sunday, Volker Schlöndorff's drama ''Die Fälschung'' (1981), in which Ms. Schygulla plays a wealthy widow having an affair with a German journalist, will be shown.

(Laura Sinagra)    ANNIE (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Norwegian singer Annie's happy dance pop takes on darker aspects because of associations with the minimalist techno club scene and work with bands like Royksopp and St. Etienne. For these shows, she will DJ with her Finnish producer Timo Kaukolampi. Tuesday at 10 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, Maritime Hotel, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (718)599-3101, $10.

(Sinagra)    ANTIBALAS AND SOULIVE (Tonight) Antibalas delivers a New York makeover to Fela Kuti's Afrobeat, the Nigerian funk propelled by burly saxophones, fierce percussion and righteous anger. Soulive is an organ-guitar-drums trio that harks back to the 1950's and 1960's, playing meaty, blues-centered jazz and funk. Lately, it has been hooking up with a little hip-hop. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation.(Jon Pareles)    ALESSANDRA BELLONI AND BRAZILAIN GUESTS: NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS (Tomorrow) Ms. Belloni, the singer and tambourine player, has spent years researching ancient songs and trance rituals from southern Italy.

Recent performance programs have explored the mystical side of samba, baião, forro and capoeira. 8 p.m., Synod Hall, Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)665-4516, $20. (Pareles)    * DAVID BERKELEY (Tonight) David Berkeley has a lustrous, melancholy voice akin to Tim Buckley and Nick Drake, and his songs offer both misgivings and consolation. 7 p.m. Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200, $12.

(Pareles)    BOUKMAN EKSPERYANS, BOUKAN GINEN (Tonight) A double bill of Haitian rock based on voodoo rhythms. Boukman Eksperyans went to the Haitian countryside to collect the Afro-Haitian rhythms of rural voodoo and carnival music. Then it added electric guitars and lyrics hinting at revolutionary messages, and reshaped a generation of Haitian rock. Boukan Ginen was formed by an ex-member of Boukman Eksperyans. 12 a.m. and 2 a.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $20, $22 at the door. (Pareles)    DAVID BYRNE (Wednesday) The stylish, brainy punk rocker and world-music fixture David Byrne has been in danger of slipping into cliché. But at a recent show, Mr. Byrne was a man on fire, shaking and hurling his yelps into the balcony. His latest work features the Texas-based chamber group Tosca Strings, who will appear with him here. 5 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777, $37, $40 at the door. (Sinagra)    BILLY CORGAN (Monday and Tuesday) One of the more abrasive alternative rockers of the 90's, Billy Corgan (of Smashing Pumpkins fame) nonetheless penned some of the decade's most triumphant pop complaints. After feigning humility for 2003's Zwan project, he released a book of his poems and recorded a just-released solo album. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 at the door. (Sinagra)    C-RAYZ WALZ, J LIVE, VAST AIRE (Wednesday) This trio of local rappers share an aesthetic that idealizes the East Coast Golden Age of elite M.C.'s. That is, they pursue nuance over histrionics and hubris. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, $15. (Sinagra)    D'GARY (Tonight) It has been a while since the Malagasy guitarist D'Gary was first hailed as the low-key prodigy from Madagascar's back country whose self-taught style involved exquisitely detailed flourishes over unorthodox rhythms, but his approach remains distinctive. 10 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155, $18, $22 at the door.(Sinagra)    * DR. DOG (Thursday) This emerging Philadelphia band loves breezy vocal harmonies, but the live show is much louder and more exuberant, especially when Scott McMicken unleashes one of his wailing, shape-shifting guitar solos. Opening for Apostle of Hustle. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Kelefa Sanneh)    EISLEY (Tonight) The waifs in this pretty pop quartet are siblings, home schooled in a Texas small-town by Christian parents who supported their daughters' Radiohead obsession. If they seem slight now, just wait. The youngest writes the best stuff, and her round, imploring voice sounds spookily like Christine McVie's. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15. (Sinagra)    EELS (Thursday) There's really only one eel, the prolific confessional indie rocker Mark Everett. His projects include the hip-hop kitsch of ''I Am the Messiah'' (SpinART). His latest work delves into family deaths and trauma, moving from countrified swoon to ironic flail to self-aware, yet nostalgic, regret. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212)840-2824, $24.50 and $29.50.(Sinagra)    FEIST (Tomorrow) A pal and collaborator of the dirty electroclash queen Peaches and part of the Canadian indie collective Broken Social Scene, the warm-voiced Feist brings more of a cabaret swing to her own music. She's good at affecting a Continental, beer-hall gloom, but her best songs are quirky, plucked jazz-tinged numbers that make her sound like a hipper Norah Jones. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $20. (Sinagra)    RUTH GERSON (Thursday) With a voice that rises from tender endearments to a bluesy, impassioned growl, Ruth Gerson sings folk-rock songs that reach for the status of anthems. 8 p.m. Sin-e, 148 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212)388-0077, $10. (Pareles)    THE GET UP KIDS, FRENCH KICKS (Tonight) The jumping-bean energy of the emo rock stalwarts the Get Up Kids shames anyone not pogo-ing to their earnest beat. The French Kicks have moved from the angular post-punk of their Washington roots to a more wistful new wave sound. 5 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $18, $20 at the door (sold out).(Sinagra)    HAMELL ON TRIAL (Wednesday) A solo performer with the force of a hard-rock band, Ed Hamell quick-strums his acoustic guitar and delivers torrents of words, sometimes funny, sometimes furious. 9:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155, $12. (Pareles)    JOHN HIATT, THE NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALLSTARS (Tomorrow) Mr. Hiatt's songs get to the heart of human frailty, loyalty and love, even if they take a sidelong route. With a deep-diving baritone, a twang-happy band and enough strange facial expressions to rival Jim Carrey, Mr. Hiatt sings his songs as convincingly as anyone around. The jamming Southern rock band North Mississippi All-Stars play an asymmetrical, cantankerous blues from the Mississippi Delta and the hill country nearby. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 at the door. (Pareles)    HOPEWELL/DOS/THE BLUE VAN (Tomorrow) Hopewell looks back to the majestic side of psychedelia, wafting high tenor vocals over stately songs with wah-wah ripples at the edges. Dos includes Mike Watt, the bassist and singer of the Minutemen and Firehose, and Kira Roessler. See above for the Blue Van.

(Sanneh)    LA LEY (Thursday) La Ley, from Mexico, is a long-running Rock en Español band that's hugely popular south of the border. It's also a painfully earnest band aspiring to be Mexico's answer to U2 or Depeche Mode. This is billed as its final tour. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 Thursday. (Pareles)    TED LEO AND THE PHARMACISTS, RADIO 4 (Sunday) The Irish-American indie rocker Ted Leo plays soulful punk, nearly popping a neck vein for political justice. But his melodic sensibility and sudden falsetto also recall the melodic 70's arena-rock of bands like Thin Lizzy. Radio 4 plays steadily improving post-punk. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Union Square, (212)777-6800. $15.(Sinagra)    * ELLA LEYA (Tomorrow) Born in Azerbaijan and celebrated as a jazz singer in what was the Soviet Union, Ella Leya rediscovered the melancholy songs called Russian romances after she emigrated to the United States. On her album ''Russian Romance'' (B-Elite), she sings them with a tenderly mournful voice, in exquisite arrangements that merge chamber music, Russian and Central Asian touches. 7:30 p.m. Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200, $25. (Pareles)    LEZ ZEPPELIN, (Wednesday) Strapping on the double-necked Gibson with attitude to burn, this all-girl quartet pays tribute to its swaggering namesake Led Zeppelin, ripping through the catalog with blazing accuracy. Of course, they also have their gender-bending way with macho metaphors about squeezed lemons and dripping honey. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Sinagra)    LHASA (Thursday) Lhasa sings in Spanish, French and English, with a husky, torchy voice that fills her music with the smoldering drama of Mexican boleros and French chansons. 8 p.m. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, $20, $25 at the door. (Pareles)    THE LITTLE KILLERS, CHEATER SLICKS (Thursday) This garage-rock showcase stars the local trio the Little Killers and Cheater Slicks, a veteran band that finds ways to combine exuberance with meanness. 9 p.m., Sin-é, 148-150 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212)388-0077, $10. (Sanneh)    * THE LONG BLONDES (Tomorrow) The Long Blondes, a three-woman, two-man band from England, hark back to the sparse, scrabbling late-1970's post-punk of the Slits and Delta Five on the handful of songs they have released, including the eager ''Giddy Stratospheres'' (What's Your Rupture), which takes some unexpected turns. 11 p.m., TriBeCa Grand, 2 Avenue of the Americas, at Church Street, (212) 519-6677; free with RSVP to getrad@igetrvng.com. (Pareles)    LONGWAVE (Wednesday) Longwave ponders self-destruction and transcendence in brooding songs with guitar lines that coil and climb.

(Pareles)    LYNYRD SKYNYRD (Sunday) Their funky Southern hard rock made them one of the best bands of the 70's, and the plane crash that killed the singer Ronnie Van Zant and others made Skynyrd's story the most horrific ''Behind the Music'' tragedy. Remaining original members, the guitarist Gary Rossington and the keyboardist Billy Powell, continue in the tradition of the band's boogie stomp. 7 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516)334-0800, $50.50. (Sinagra)    MADLIB, PEANUT BUTTER WOLF (Monday) He has just released an album as Quasimoto, but the nasal-voiced motormouth and D.J. performs here under his more frequent moniker with label mates including his old-school Bay Area producer, Peanut Butter Wolf. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $22.50. (Sinagra)    MAGIK MARKERS (Tonight) This noise-rock trio's sound assaults build from shirring buzz and ominous clang to maelstroms of bash and feedback. Kicking and jerking as the spirit moves her, the vocalist and guitarist Elisa Ambrogio surges from hiss to howl, wrestling with her guitar to choke out its most dangerous peals. 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503, $8. (Sinagra)    MC LYTE (Tonight) The last decade has been full of comeback attempts by this 80's hip-hop star who, along with artists like Roxanne Shante, was vocal about the macho rap game. If her music hasn't kept up with the latest trends, her feminist message about misogyny in hip-hop is timely. 10 p.m., Roxy, 515 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)645-5156, $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    MEAT BEAT MANIFESTO (Thursday) Jack Dangers has been layering together samples since the heyday of industrial rock in the 80's. On Meat Beat Manifesto's latest album, ''At the Center'' (Thirsy Ear), he mixes jazz musicians and the voice of the poet Kenneth Rexroth, letting his densely packed tracks swing as much as they stomp.

(Pareles)    NEW PORNOGRAPHERS, THE STARS, THE SADIES (Tomorrow) This revved-up Vancouver outfit's power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension that makes anthems of their absurdist lyrical bric-a-brac.

(Sinagra)    EDDIE PALMIERI (Tomorrow and Thursday) Latin pianists have a longstanding affinity for jazz, but Eddie Palmieri may well be the jazziest and most experimental of them all, plunging into modal harmonies and burly, splashing chord clusters, building suspense and then detonating it with rhythm.

(Pareles)    ROBERT PLANT (Sunday and Monday) After scaling hard-rock peaks in his prime, the Led Zeppelin frontman's solo efforts never matched the skin-tight hedonism of his heyday.

Sometimes it is as reassuring as an electric blanket, other times it's as annoying as a wet blanket, and almost all of the time it attempts to envelop existence in one large monochrome blanket, grappling with birth, love, pain, friendship, madness and death in such universal terms that to wallow in a specific tragedy -- and Mr. Taylor has been faced with many over the years -- is to commit a sin of solipsism. 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116 Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400. $25 to $69.50. (Pareles)    TEGAN AND SARA, RON SEXSMITH, EAST VILLAGE OPERA (Sunday) The Canadian twins Tegan and Sara's lyrics about love and loss are underground girl anthems.

PETER WATROUS Jazz Album of the Week    Javon Jackson, \\"When the Time Is Right,\\" Blue Note, CD, $10.99. Javon Jackson, a young tenor saxophonist who has spent time in the jazz trenches, having worked with Art Blakey and Freddie Hubbard, has put together one of the best albums of the year so far. Produced by the singer Betty Carter, it's full of smart touches, including unaccompanied saxophone cadenzas, duets, a vocal and some heated chase choruses featuring the alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett.

Managements seem to cling to a mistaken notion that charm and age are inseparable, that dining rooms in houses dating to the 18th century need no further credentials, and that somehow stains, poor housekeeping, bleak lighting and mediocre food will be forgotten or forgiven as customers whisper at the sight of wide-plank floors, low raftered ceilings, wood paneling and the flash of copper and brass.   Certainly a number of these attributes can be found at The Kittle House. The place has the charm, the age, the floors, the rafters and the paneling, but in the dining room the lighting is murky, the ceilings stained, the service absurdly inept and the food uninspired - failings compounded by steep prices, prices that promise food a cut above the ordinary, not to mention professional service and spiffy surroundings.

Mr. Patrick plays Cash's father, Ray, and while his time on screen is limited, you remember every minute of it. In ''The X-Files,'' he made Doggett so cool and opaque that for a few episodes it seemed that he might be an alien. His character ''In Walk the Line'' is all too human, an impoverished farmer with a wife and five children.

It is quite evident that Universal spared no expense in the making of this screen contribution and Mr. Freund reveals his fine hand in the magnificent scenes.It is a romantic melodrama which, notwithstanding that it is scarcely credible, succeeds in tickling one's fancy. If there be a weak spot Mr. Freund atones for it by his direction and his remarkable eye for camera angles. The story deals with a somewhat delicate situation in secret-service work during the World War, for a bride happens to be spying on her husband. She is a Russian and he a German, for the time being in Austria.It is one of those cases in which truth and fiction are quite adroitly blended. Fay Wray acts Maria, a nurse, who soon after the narrative opens becomes the wife of Captain Franck, played by Nils Asther. Franck has assigned to him two Austrian spy experts, Captain Weber and Mr. Schulz, who are just as keen as the German on apprehending an agent referred to as B-24. Naturally, the audience is permitted to know that Maria is the mysterious espion, but this does not alter the fact that the tale is unwound with shrewdness and a certain suspense. Governmental departments may not sign their telegrams \\"Secret Service,\\" but what of it? Maria is doing her utmost to help Russia and Franz is lending his brains to Germany and Austria.Mr. Freund has evidently learned something about intelligence activities, for here and there one discovers an ingenious trick. One of the most interesting episodes takes place in Russia, and the persons involved are General Philipow, neatly acted by Noah Beery, Maria, and Franz, the latter having risked being backed up against a wall before a firing squad to see Maria, who had fled to her native heath.There are some excellent war glimpses here, and at one moment the beautiful Maria is beheld crawling through the mud and mire of No Man's Land and finally reaching friendly trenches.Miss Wray does well in her rôle and Mr. Asther is capable in his. Noah Beery is excellent as the elderly Russian roué, General Philipow.

Their spoofing of youth in revolt is frequently amusing and the quality of the dialogue proves that the premier filmmakers of Astoria have lost none of their wit. The same, alas, cannot be said of their sense of direction.On the surface, it would appear that Mr. Hecht wanted a satire while Mr. MacArthur preferred a farce. Or it may have been the other way 'round. Neither seemed willing to surrender and we suspect that on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, when Mr. Hecht was working on \\"Jumbo,\\" Mr. MacArthur was directing a farce","excerpt":"and on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays (Maid MacArthur's days off), Mr. Hecht was being satirical up to here. \\"Soak the Rich\\" must have been a headache in the cutting room; it's little short of amazing that it came out as well as it did.It does seem that satire would have been the proper medium for the H. & M. theory that youth is not radical but merely young. As one character expresses it:\\"Theirs is not radicalism, sir. They will grow up to be quite conventional gentlemen. While they are young they sing, struggle and dream of something else. A few years ago it was the fashion to be Don Juans. Today ideas have taken the place of drink and revolt is the latest form of necking.\\"To prove this point, they have invented a tycoon with a fear of the soak-the-rich tax bill, a greater fear of radicalism and a suspicious resemblance to Walter Connolly. His daughter, who needs a spanking, insists upon enrolling in his private university, promptly becomes enamored of the chief college radical—Mr. John Howard will do—and is involved in one of those typical undergraduate protests against the dismissal of a Professor Popper, who has written a pamphlet endorsing the soak-the-rich program. Add to this some student demonstrations, the tycoon's apoplexy when his daughter joins the down-with-the-capitalists movement and the romance which convinces every one that youth in revolt is merely youth having growing pains and you have \\"Soak the Rich.\\"Well, not entirely. There is still Lionel Stander to be considered as Muglia, head of the Society for the Abolition of Monsters, the quintessence of radicalism and the chap who could put Lenin in one pocket, Stalin in the other pocket and still have room for Karl Marx.There is the Hecht-MacArthur dialogue, of which this is typical: \\"I'm a firm believer in democracy, provided it lets me alone.\\" And there are capital performances by Mr. Connolly, Mr. Stander, Mr. Howard and a few others. All told, \\"Soak the Rich\\" salvages considerable entertainment from the wreckage of its authors' indecision. And we hope the real campus radicals won't take their lampooning too seriously.

Much of their afternoon work sessions, however, was devoted to arguing. They argued about scenes and words, and the order of scenes and words. They argued about who would say what in the film. They even argued about which of them would cook dinner.

It snuffed out the life of a fair lady, and grimly reported the death of a moving-picture director. Not content with just the history of a lurid past, it killed an artist and then tried chucking knives at the master detective, Charlie Chan. This last effort failed, and the hero of \\"The Black Camel\\" lived at least long enough to worry a confession out of those least suspected.The latest addition to the saga of Chan takes place in Hawaii, and a better spot for two murders and an attempt could not easily be found. For while blood runs darkly over the floors of a grand mansion, outside are the natives. They strum their guitars, and sing simple, alliterative songs to the accompaniment of the sea. Their rustic simplicity is occasionally disturbed by bathing beauties establishing alibis, but by this time Hawaii is used to almost everything.The amiable Charlie Chan rolls up his career, still proving the correctness of that old phrase by Ed Wynn. He follows clues to their ends, retains his bland manner while the lights go out and knives rattle about his head, and delivers the calm aphorisms of Earl Derr Biggers. In this latest instalment of the Chan legends he has changed not much from those which went before, and judging from the Roxy's interest in him he has a considerable following. They seemed to approve of \\"The Black Camel,\\" although the hilarity was never out of control.Almost every one but the cameraman is involved in murder's machinations at one time or another. There are persons married, divorced and with motives","excerpt":"and others only hopeful of the thing called love—and with motives. There is even a painter, living native like a character by Somerset Maugham, and servants, a seer and many vagrants of the Hawaiian shore. From this crowd Detective Chan weeds his pair of dangerous thistles.Warner Oland takes the part of Chan, and gives to the picture a good and even performance. Tarneverro—the man every one but Charlie suspects—is played by Bela Lugosi. Dorothy Revier has the rôle of Shelah Fane, one of murder's most noted victims. Sally Eilers is Julie O'Neil. The identity of the person who put out the lights in a critical moment is not revealed, although the knife thrower confesses. Charlie Chan makes him. THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1985","title":"WASHINGTON THE lines were sharply drawn well before the start of the Civil Rights Commission's sometimes testy ''consultation/hearing'' last week on affirmative action. A majority of the Commission, like the Reagan Administration, opposes quotas, and some members have criticized affirmative action plans designed to give preference to specified groups, such as blacks and women.   In a joint statement last month, Clarence M. Pendleton Jr., the commission's chairman, and Morris B. Abram, its vice chairman, called on civil rights leaders ''to acknowledge the difference between the discriminatory affirmative action of racial preferences, whether called a quota or goal, and nondiscriminatory affirmative action such as that endorsed by the commission.''   Not all their colleagues share their views. Two holdover members of the commission from the Carter Administration, Blandina Cardenas Ramirez and Mary Frances Berry, issued a statement that ''Civil rights laws were not passed to give civil rights protection to all Americans,'' but ''out of a recognition that some Americans already had protection because they belong to a favored group","excerpt":"and others, including blacks, Hispanics and women of all races, did not because they belonged to disfavored groups.''

The world-famous fireworks complex that blew up, killing two Grucci family members and damaging more than 100 nearby homes, sat in the middle of a residential neighborhood.

It is a first feature by Jan Troell, the 27-year-old Swedish director who also photographed the movie, edited it and wrote the screenplay with Bengst Forslund. He may be just a little too facile for his own good.The movie, which opened yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema, is full of frozen frames of birds caught in mid-air, of slow motion equations of lyricism, of leafy forests, of sunsets, of snowscapes, of long, deliberate camera movements, the end of which you often will guess. It is, in fact, so damned full of what passes for poetic vision, especially in Swedish movies, that by the end of almost two hours I was ready to opt for Andy Warhol's \\"Empire,\\" the world's most minimal movie effort.This is a very personal and perhaps slightly overstated response, prompted principally by Troell's editing, which allows the exuberance of the director to turn into self-indulgence. There is much in the movie that is good and firm, and as quietly aware as the hero, Olof, whom Eddie Axberg plays with such seeming effortlessness.At the beginning of the movie, an adaptation of Evvind Johnson's semi-autobiographical novel, Olof, almost 14, is sent out to work in a remote lumber mill when his father becomes ill. A quite thinking, observant boy, Olof fights with his stupid foreman, moves on to a job as a candy butcher in a movie theater, and later tours the carnival circuit, cranking a manually operated movie projector. In the accepted chronology of post-puberty literature, Olof learns about life, death, sex and politics.As written and played, the vignettes are softly oblique, never as heavy handed as they might be, as when young Olof has his first affair. It's with the eager daughter of a blacksmith. Far from being the shattering experience he expects, it all develops rather easily, like going for a swim. For such a young director, Mr. Troell has a nicely nostalgic way of handling his humor.None of the episodes, however, are treated in particular depth. Instead, they are too prettily photographed, dressed up with symbols and poetically paced so that often the eye simply must look away from the screen towards an exit sign. It's the kind of movie that could end at almost any point—like a serial.The excellent supporting cast includes Ulla Sjoblom, as a good-natured older woman who supplements Olof's initial sexual experience","excerpt":"and Per Oscarsson (who was so fine in \\"Hunger\\"), as a young man with whom Olof, finally a socially conscious activist, tries with comic futility to organize a strike of railroad workers.The Swedish dialogue is translated by English subtitles that are sometimes maddeningly cryptic.

She always questioned whether peanuts constituted an ingredient in the foods she was about to eat, but apparently did not do so in this instance because she could not conceive of peanuts in chili.   Allergy to peanuts may not be one of the very common allergies, but it is common enough to be of major importance. Allergists know of no way to desensitize such individuals, and the patients do not ''outgrow'' their allergy. For many of them, exposure to peanuts in their food can lead to fatality, as in this instance, through inability to breathe. If they're lucky enough to have this allergy discovered in time, those allergic to peanuts are wise to carry a bee-sting kit or equivalent for immediate first aid that can be lifesaving. They should also wear a MedicAlert bracelet. Peanuts are self-evident in certain foods, but they also appear at times in ice cream and other foods where they are not suspected. Because peanuts are not nuts but legumes, milder symptoms of similar nature can be provoked by beans and peas and other plants of this family","excerpt":"and perhaps the beans in the chili, added to the peanuts, produced sufficient reaction to become clinically as severe as described. However, most of those allergic to peanuts can take small quantities of other legumes in stride.

The imitation offered is flimsy, thin and filled with air pockets, and assuredly no intelligent individual would think much of himself if he could not find his way through it. But, of course, David Powell as an actor has to go through the contortions motion picture men think persons do when lost in a fog","excerpt":"and Powell knows better than most of the people working with him what a real fog can be—for he comes from London. True, this is a sea-fog, but that would only make it white.Irvin \\"Willat, the director, also has inserted in this production a feeble piece of \\"business,\\" quite bromidic and altogether unnecessary. A man accused of murder is brought to the home of the Sheriff by a hungry deputy. The deputy leaves his charge with the Sheriff's niece, not telling her that the man is wanted for the murder of her uncle. She was already fond of the man, having known him before, and decides to help him to get away, believing him innocent of any crime. The deputy is in the kitchen appeasing his hunger, when he hears the accused man and the girl moving in the other room. To keep watch on them he places a mirror on a kitchen chair so he can see them, and sits down to eat. The black cook, wishing to befog the mirror, essays to do so with steam from the kettle, other cooking utensils and the boiler. It might have been easier for the sleuth to take his meal in the other room.The story is based upon the Sheriff being shot through a door by accident, whereas he actually was killed by his own deputy, who was discovered collecting graft.Dorothy Dalton plays the part of Gale Brenon, the Sheriff's niece. Powell is Roger Wainwright. He has plenty of work in this production. The fog scene takes place when Powell is making his way through the wooded marshes. He is in a dinner jacket with a handcuff fastened around one wrist. Emerging from the mud, slime and water, Powell appears to be placidly bearing with the scene. Later he is shot in the side of the head. Then they threaten to shoot him again. The girl at first believes that he murdered her father—after being told about it—and then hears how the slaying did take place from another girl. So having been so \\"nasty\\" to him Gale makes up by accepting his proposal of marriage.There are scenes in this picture of wild parties. Sheriff Holmes raids a place in Florida where they not only indulge in cocktails, but also have roulette.Maurice Costello is compelling as the Deputy Sheriff, but Dorothy Dalton is Dorothy Dalton, the well-known motion picture actress. Powell does not seem enthusiastic about his part. Possibly he knew beforehand what a mess he would have to be in a good deal of the time.People's Chorus Concert.The People's Chorus of New York gave a concert in the Town Hall last evening as part of the celebration in honor of the city's silver jubilee. Rubi Davis provided several violin selections and assisted the chorus in giving Handel's \\"Largo\\" and Margaret Northrup, soprano, appeared in a group of songs.

Adron was predeceased by his wife of 42 years, Kathleen Simpson Trantum, in 1981, and by his wife of 17 years, Peggy Jarvis Trantum, in 1999. Adron was born in Jamestown, New York, and spent his early years in Hagerstown, Maryland, and Ingold, North Carolina. He attended Columbia University and obtained his degree at Pace College in New York City. In the summer of 1929 Adron joined The Investors Management Company, now part of the American Funds, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He retired from the same firm as senior portfolio manager in 1968. In 1941 Adron and Kathleen moved to Ridgewood, New Jersey, where their family was raised and their children graduated from Ridgewood High School. He was a Decaon of the West Side Presbyterian Church. Adron and Kathleen spent the first five years of their retirement in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts, before moving to Vero Beach, Florida, in 1972. Following Kathleen's death, Adron and Peggy married in 1983. Adron, Peggy and their late spouses had first met in 1949, so when they lost their life's mates, their union and love for each other was natural. It was an inspiration for their families and confirmed that life does not end with the loss of a spouse. Their enjoyment of life together should be a reminder that life can begin at eighty! Adron's time with us was filled with career achievement, caring, and laughter. Above all, his legacy is his devotion to Kathleen and Peggy, his children, and his extended family.

It's the quietest, too: no screaming sirens, chattering machine-guns, playing searchlights—not even, so far as we could discover, a wall. It's rather nice for a change, after a succession of films like \\"Alcatraz\\" and \\"San Quentin,\\" which have almost driven us stir-crazy, to relax and enjoy a short sentence, a clean job as a hospital trusty, a tenor voice (or at least a pretty good double), star billing in the weekly prison broadcast, and at last a pardon from the Governor. A happy ending was just what the penological film needed.When he is sent up, Dick Foran isn't blessed with any of these comforts, including, apparently, the tenor voice, which just seems to come to him one dull day, together with a guitar accompaniment from a neighboring cell. At first Dick is as tough and rebellious as he was outside, when he used to slug people for fun, but Father John Litel, who dropped him with an unexpected right hook one afternoon at the beach, fixes that.Father John, who also happens to be the prison chaplain, reclaims Dick for society, helps to prove that he was sent up on a framed murder charge, anyway, and turns him over to June Travis, with whom presumably he leads a useful life as a crooner thereafter. The auctorial message of Warden Lawes seems a bit obscure, but we construe it to be that no young man need fear Sing Sing, unless he just can't carry a tune.At the CentralBill Boyd in another of his familiar Hopalong Cassidy episodes, this time called simply \\"Cassidy of Bar 20,\\" provides the \\"Western\\" half of the double-decker menu currently offered at the Central","excerpt":"and Rod La Rocque in an uncommonly dull gangster comedy, titled \\"Taming the Wild,\\" makes up the ham content on the bill of fare. Both items come definitely under the heading of film roughage—suitable mainly for growing boys—and neither is recommended to persons with fastidious tastes or weak stomachs.At 86th St. Garden TheatreWithout firing a shot, the UFA film concern, with the able assistance of Director Karl Ritter and a first-class company of players, has turned out perhaps the most effective war propaganda picture ever made in Germany. No wonder that Dr. Goebbels, the Nazi \\"educational\\" chief, gave Herr Ritter his autographed photograph with a highly laudatory inscription when \\"Urlaub auf Ehrenwort\\" (Furlough on Word of Honor) had its première in Berlin a couple of months ago.This dramatic sketch of what happens when a youthful lieutenant (Rolf Moeblus) gives his seventy men six hours' leave during a stop-over in Berlin in the very last months of the World War grips the audiences at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre from start to finish, although they know that every last man will resist temptation and save the beloved young officer from a court-martial.For Americans, and for many Germans, the attempt to depict war-weary civilians and Socialist and radical anti-war agitators as the very scum of the earth goes beyond all reason, as does the assumption that German Army discipline and sense of duty make every soldier 100 per cent loyal under such trying circumstances.But these considerations cannot rob this unusual picture of the merit of showing some of the most touching and natural scenes of family, and other, reunions ever put on the screen. Especially affecting is the hunger look in the eyes of a tiny girl at the sight of a loaf of army bread in the hands of one of the young soldiers. There is no bathos and there are plenty of amusing incidents to relieve the tension.Prominent in the cast are Fritz Kampers, Berta Drews, Ingebord Theek and Kaethe Haack. The rank and file is right up to the standard set by the principals.At the 86th Street CasinoReported in a Vienna dispatch of Oct. 31, 1935, as \\"studying English furiously\\" in preparation for a possible Hollywood career, little Traudl Stark, then aged 5 years, has in the meantime interrupted said studies long enough to make a successful film début in her native German.In \\"Seine Tochter ist der Peter\\" (His Daughter Is Peter), just arrived from the Austrian metropolis at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre, the robust and charming Traudl manages to hold her own with such highly competent actors as Karl Ludwig Diehl and Olga Tschechowa (her screen father and mother), Maria Andergast (her future step-mother) and Paul Hoerbiger.She also bears up well under the competition of some remarkably well-photographed views of the lovely mountain region in and around Salzburg. Traudl looks a great deal like Shirley Temple. Heinz Helbig, who directed the picture for the Mondial concern, has followed the American model of making her the deus ex machina, but without reducing the rest of the cast to the part of extras.The story, which is of slight importance, is explained by English titles. There are lots of funny situations and wisecracks and no tragedy.At the Teatro HispanoPerhaps the best film sketch of country life ever made in Spain is now at the Teatro Hispano in Harlem carrying the title of \\"Nobleza Baturra\\" (Rustic Chivalry). Directed by Florian Rey for the \\"Cifesa\\" Company and turned out about a year before the outbreak of civil war in July, 1936, this smoothly running picture makes excellent use of the dark beauty and talent of Imperio Argentina, a popular Spanish actress.As the daughter of a peasant landowner whose hand is sought by a handsome youth employed on her father's farm and by a comparatively wealthy young friend of the family, Imperio has plenty of opportunities to sing love pieces, dance and show her rather imperious, but essentially kind, nature.She is ably reinforced by a good company, among whom are Miguel Ligero, Juan de Orduña, Pepe Calle, Manuel Luna and Pilar Muñoz. As an offset to the cheap village gossip when tales are told about the heroine, both admirers eventually show real chivalry and clear her good name. And without tragedy.The rural types are admirably portrayed, the dialogue is entertaining and the photography is fairly clear.At the Modern PlayhouseWith a cast of familiar and capable players, including the snappy brunette Anna Tokes, the blond comedienne Margit Dayka, the likable Antal Pagar and the amusing Gyula Gozon and Gyula Csortos. Director Bela Gaal has managed to make \\"Az Ember Neha Teved\\" (Man Sometimes Errs), now at the Modern Playhouse, fairly entertaining.The story of this routine romantic comedy, imported from Budapest by Hungaria Pictures, Inc., is that of a girl determined to save her father from bankruptcy at all costs, which she does in the end without any sacrifice at all, after many funny complications mainly built around the theft of a valuable brooch.

It is about a draft dodger who, having lived under a pseudonym in a strange town for several years, is discovered by the F.B.I. As he is trying to escape, the police mistake a branch he has picked up in the woods for a gun, and he is shot. The movie ends as it begins, with the sequence of his flight and his death.It is a very romantic and elegiacal little story—better than most underground films, but not very strong. There is some low-grade ideological discussion part way through, which is static and which—since movies, unlike books, leave one no time to think, and unlike live performances, give one no chance to influence by responding—is out of place. And the movie makes no pretense of engaging reality: the draft dodger in the picture is chased at one point by a helicopter. But Mekas is such a lyrical filmmaker that he seems more interested in cinema than in ideology","excerpt":"and scenes in which the young man and his girl are photographed—by means of a lens, the rim of which is coated with Vaseline—as though they were at the end of a soft, fuzzed tunnel, are lovely. The rest is delicate, dreamy and a bit frail.

There are interviews with Establishment leaders of radical antiwar protest—notably Prof. Noam Chomsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Rev. William Sloane Coffin of Yale. Guerrilla Newsreel intends to produce and distribute regular short films of events from the New Left point of view. A Guerrilla Newsreel of the recent Pentagon protest rally—with participants marching to the citadel of the military of a country involved in a war to confront armed soldiers there, without any persecution under the law or any loss of life on either side—already exists.

Yet each produced one major operatic score, and coincidentally both operas have just been released in new versions by the same record company, with the same principal tenor.    The two recordings are of Stravinsky's ''Rake's Progress,'' with Riccardo Chailly - who led his Radio Symphony Orchestra of Berlin in its New York debut at Carnegie Hall only last night - conducting the London Sinfonietta and its chorus, with Philip Langridge as Tom Rakewell, Samuel Ramey as Nick Shadow and the young Cathryn Pope as Anne Trulove (London 411 644-2, two CD's)","excerpt":"and Schoenberg's ''Moses und Aron,'' with Georg Solti conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, with Franz Mazura as Moses and Mr. Langridge as Aron (London 414 264-1, two LP's, with CD's forthcoming).

The most eloquent advocate of this brand of highway design was the regional planner and forester Benton MacKaye (remembered most for his conception of the Appalachian Trail in 1921). MacKaye spoke of it as the ''townless highway'' and argued for strong land-use controls to prevent strip development from enveloping these regional arterials.

For it took as its partners one old woman, one mere outsider and one rather intimately concerned nephew. This last had the distinction of dancing twice, because canny physicians now have a drug that occasionally overcomes one murder. And so, if it adds nothing else to the lore of Broadway, the picture has the distinction, of boasting a character who was killed twice.But there are other factors to \\"Murder by the Clock\\" than a dull, statistical history of the relationship between quantity massacre and art. There is, for example, a madman among those who go about with motives, not the gentle, all-seeeing soul of Wordsworth but the newer one of melodrama. There is also a girl, on the vampire style, using the old connotation of the word and not the new. There are policemen, both upright and comic","excerpt":"and secret passages, chases through the nichts and clutching hands galore. These hands are the least of the evil.With its murders and double murders, its misunderstandings and the assault of detectives, the picture presents, if anything, a little too much of the theory of sudden death and destruction. No sooner has one gentleman crumpled to the floor than another starts on the road that has no ending. There are so many that at times it becomes a little confusing, and amateur detectives in the audience clutch their seats with the despair of the police on the screen. And then, when the nephew is murdered twice, and by different persons, there is nothing left save a marvel for the wonders of science.Courtesy forbids the history of the plot, or the plural, as it happens. However, the girl in the case is played by Lilyan Tashman. It is she who lures every one but a very candid officer to destruction, only to be caught finally by another bit of science-fingerprints. William Boyd is that officer, and Irving Pichel has the part of the madman, who is suspected of one murder and finally commits another.

There were dreams of a new world order. There were fears of a new Depression. For Americans, more than for any other combatants, World War II was a paradoxical experience -- simultaneously horrifying and exhilarating. For all the fervor with which Americans committed themselves to a great national cause, they were terrified at the possibility of losing the struggle -- a possibility that seemed particularly real in that first difficult year after Pearl Harbor -- and of having to live in a world dominated by tyranny. Even as the war neared its end and victory seemed assured, optimism mingled with doubt","excerpt":"and several very different ideas about the nation, the world and the future seized the American imagination. Fifty years later, many of those ideas seem relics of a more innocent time.

FEW AMERICANS WHO GAVE SERIOUS THOUGHT TO WHAT THE WAR had been about could avoid feeling profound anxiety in 1945, as they contemplated the beginning of the postwar era. World War II had revealed a human capacity for evil and destruction that exceeded even the darkest assumptions of previous eras. It had been a war against militarized tyrannies, a war to stop nearly a decade of brutal, naked expansionism. It was a war to avenge what Franklin Roosevelt called the \\"dastardly\\" Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. And gradually, as news of the Holocaust had filtered out of Europe to an incredulous world, it became for some Americans a war against genocide, against a madness so terrible that many people, even when faced with incontrovertible evidence of its existence, found the knowledge of it unassimilable.

Below are offerings from 12 theaters across the state:    CENTENARY STAGE COMPANY        Carl Wallnau, artistic director at Centenary Stage Company in Hackettstown, recently directed Molière's ''Tartuffe'' at the Barnstormers Summer Theater in Tamworth, N.H., a location he described as ''moose, beavers and woodchucks.'' The timing was fortuitous, as Centenary was planning to offer ''Tartuffe'' this fall. ''Some of the actors from that production will be down here,'' he said. ''Tartuffe'' will run from Oct. 7 to 23. Also on the schedule: ''Sight Unseen'' by Donald Margulies (Nov. 4 to 20) and ''The Poetry of Pizza'' by Deborah Brevoort (Feb. 24 to March 12). Information: (908)979-0900 or www.centenarystageco.org,    GEORGE STREET PLAYHOUSE       David Saint, artistic director at George Street in New Brunswick, said that Arthur Laurents's play, ''2 Lives,'' is based on Mr. Laurents's own union with his partner, Tom Hatcher, which has lasted more than five decades. ''It's about a relationship between two men that isn't about coming out or AIDS,'' Mr. Saint said. ''It's about the threat of loss and what people do to survive.'' The play by Mr. Laurents, who wrote the book for ''West Side Story,'' will be performed from Oct. 18 to Nov. 13. ''Inspecting Carol,'' by Daniel Sullivan and the Seattle Repertory Ensemble (Nov. 29 to Dec. 31) pokes fun at annual holiday performances of Charles Dickens's ''Christmas Carol.'' Also at George Street: ''Underneath the Lintel'' by Glen Berger (Jan. 10 to Feb. 5) and ''The Afghan Women'' by William Mastrosimone (Feb. 21 to March 19).

LUNA STAGE       The Luna Stage in Montclair will begin its fall season with the premiere of ''Robeson in Space,'' performed by Guillermo E. Brown, who wrote the script in collaboration with the play's director, Tim Raphael. The play explores the life of Paul Robeson through video, music and spoken word. Robeson, who was investigated by the F.B.I. and called before the House Un-American Activities Committee, liked space travel because he ''loved the idea that you could be free of these earthly travails,'' said Jane Mandel, Luna Stage's artistic director. ''Robeson in Space'' will run from Sept. 29 to Oct. 23. Other coming plays: ''The Normals'' by Chris Widney (Nov. 17 to Dec. 11) and ''The Confessions of Stepin Fetchit'' by Matt Robinson (Feb. 16 to March 12). Information: (973)744-3309 or www.lunastage.org.    MCCARTER THEATER CENTER       The McCarter Theater Center in Princeton commissioned Christopher Durang to write this season's first play, ''Miss Witherspoon,'' a comedy that opened on Sept. 9 and will run through Oct. 16 in Berlind Theater. Emily Mann, the theater's artistic director, who directs the play, described rehearsals as ''sitting in a room and laughing for six hours a day.'' From Oct. 11 to 30 in Matthews Theater, McCarter will present ''Gem of the Ocean'' by August Wilson, starring Phylicia Rashad and John Amos. Also at the McCarter: Eugene O'Neill's ''Moon for the Misbegotten'' (Jan. 13 to Feb. 19)","excerpt":"and Shakespeare's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' in collaboration with Paper Mill Playhouse (March 21 to April 9).

NEW JERSEY REPERTORY COMPANY       ''Klonsky and Schwartz,'' the fall season opener at the New Jersey Repertory Company in Long Branch, examines the friendship between the poet Delmore Schwartz and Milton Klonsky, a lesser-known writer. The playwright, Romulus Linney, knew Klonsky. ''Klonsky didn't do anything until after Schwartz died,'' said SuzAnne Barabas, the artistic director. ''He suffered from a failure to be able to match him.'' The play opened on Aug. 25 and will run through Oct. 2. From Oct. 14 to Nov. 20, New Jersey Repertory will present the premiere of Dan Dietz's ''Tilt Angel,'' and from Jan. 26 to March 5, Kingsley Day's and Philip LaZebnik's ''Tour de Farce.''

PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSE       Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella,'' written for television, had its premiere in 1957, with Julie Andrews as the beleaguered orphan. It will be offered in a new adaptation at Paper Mill in Millburn from Oct. 19 to Dec. 4. ''We're going back, more or less, to the original score, but marrying it to a much more contemporary script,'' said Michael Gennaro, the Paper Mill president and chief executive officer. From Jan. 18 to Feb. 26, Paper Mill will present ''The Diary of Anne Frank.'' Later offerings include ''Carnival!'' (March 8 to April 8). Information: (973)376-4343 or www.papermill.org.

The play tells the story of a man trying to give away a piano . The original play has since been modified, according to David White, the associate artistic director. Next up will be ''Harlem Doctors'' (a working title) by Laurence Holder, inspired by the story of Dr. May Edward Chinn, the first black woman doctor in New York (Feb. 2 to 19). Information: (609)392-0766 or www.passagetheatre.org.    PLAYWRIGHTS THEATER        The Playwrights Theater's artistic director, John Pietrowski, said that he and a playwright, Guillermo Reyes, are Thomas Jefferson fans. It's anyone's guess what Jefferson would think of Mr. Reyes's new comedy, ''Sunrise at Monticello,'' which portrays Jefferson living with a struggling Puerto Rican television writer (Oct. 27 to Nov. 13). ''Guillermo set out to write a historical drama, but he just couldn't do it,'' Mr. Pietrowski said. ''The play is a marvelously deconstructed historical drama.'' From Feb. 2 to 19, the theater will present ''The Good Girl Is Gone'' by D.W. Gregory. Mr. Pietrowski, who will direct the play, described it as ''a comedy about how dysfunctional families deal with family dysfunction.'' Information: (973)514-1787, extension 30, or www.ptnj.org.    PREMIERE STAGES       ''Boy Gets Girl'' by Rebecca Gilman is a thriller about a blind date gone terribly wrong.

Premiere Stages will present ''Boy Gets Girl'' from Sept. 15 to 25. Information: www.kean.edu/premierestages.

Information: (973)408-5600 or www.ShakespeareNJ.org.    12 MILES WEST THEATER COMPANY        Lenny Bart, 12 Miles West's artistic director, said ''The Rainmaker,'' by N. Richard Nash, is a lovely story about a drought in a small farming town. ''The drought serves as a metaphor for the drying up of our hopes,'' Mr. Bart said. ''Rain is a metaphor for happiness and life.'' ''The Rainmaker'' will run from Sept. 22 to Oct. 16. Information: (973)259-9187 or www.12mileswest.org.    TWO RIVER THEATER COMPANY        ''Umbrellas of Cherbourg'' a French film by Jacques Demy with music by Michel Legrand, was released in 1964 with Catherine Deneuve in the lead role. The book and lyrics were later translated into English by Sheldon Harnick, and in 1979 the Public Theater presented the play. The rights to perform the play have been difficult to obtain. But this season, Two River Theater Company in Red Bank will become the first American theater since the Public to present a full production when it opens on Sept. 22, according to the company's artistic director, Jonathan Fox. The play will run through Oct. 9. The fall's other scheduled play is ''Visiting Mr. Green'' by Jeff Baron (Nov. 3 to 20). Information: (732) 345-1400 or www.trtc.org.

When Papa Job, a young West Indian living in Detroit in the 1950's, discovers that someone is stealing cans of food from his basement, he hides in the dark to catch the thief -- and then promptly asks her to marry him. Sizway, the thief, is a tiny, mysterious Haitian woman \\"the color of blackberries,\\" a so-called black gypsy who can read Papa Job's mind. \\"You be a man of flesh and I a woman of spirit,\\" she warns him when he proposes. \\"You and me . . . don't mix.\\" Presented in the form of a mystical cautionary tale told by a shadowy pipe-smoking woman, Gita Brown's first novel examines the difficulties that are  presented when opposites attract and worlds collide. The story follows this unlikely couple as they make their way together over the years, coping with the  pressures of family life and struggling to forge a lasting bond. Their attempts  to understand each other yield some valuable insights, but the convoluted narrative -- riddled with walk-ons by witches and ghosts -- is often so murky that readers may find themselves wondering just what the narrator is smoking. Quirky supporting characters appear out of nowhere, only to be promptly abandoned","excerpt":"and Sizway's gift of telepathy suddenly and inexplicably deserts her  after the opening scenes, just when she needs it most.

They still can't readily obtain injectable contraceptives and a variety of low-dosage pills and IUD's in use in countries all over the world.   Thus it is welcome news that Norplant, the first major new contraceptive to be introduced in this country in three decades, was approved yesterday by the Food and Drug Administration.   Unlike any other contraceptive on the American market, Norplant can protect against pregnancy for up to five years. Tiny tubes filled with progestin are implanted under the skin of a woman's upper arm. The hormone is then slowly released into the body.

According to one popular myth about musical life, performers and musicologists are pitted against each other in perpetual battle.  Musicologists, it is thought, spend their lives amid library stacks, marshalling treatises, eyewitness accounts and obscure manuscripts, in an attempt to establish guidelines for authentic, historically appropriate performances. Performers, on the other hand, consider their scholarly colleagues well-intentioned but too distant from the practical problems of making music","excerpt":"and so, they select the musicological findings that suit them, discard the rest as academic irrelevancy, and play the music the way they want to.   As with most sweeping generalizations, this view contains at least a grain of truth. But it is getting a bit time-worn now, and as players and scholars edge toward a better understanding of each other, the old antagonisms are being replaced by a more ideal sort of symbiotic relationship. This is particularly true in the early music field, where musicologists themselves have taken to performing.

That early promise has now been fulfilled because the kitchen staff has developed a more authoritative hand with seasonings and corrected some earlier flaws. The characteristic steakhouse sizzle may still be lacking as meats come from kitchen to table, but that shortcoming is compensated for by the superb quality of the carefully broiled meats and fish, and the diverting side dishes and appetizers that are more stylish than those in the standard steakhouse format.   The owners are Karen Ortenzio, whose initials inspired the restaurant's name, and her husband, James, who is a wholesale meat dealer.

For the feature of the program is the seven-year-old \\"Laburnum Grove,\\" a cheerful, pre-blitz-minded version of J. B. Priestley's little family comedy—a tidy, refreshing reminder of English larking in the pre-war days","excerpt":"and supplementary to it is the heart-stirring \\"A Letter From Home,\\" which is a semi-factual picture of meager home life in England today. Purely by coincidence, Carol Reed directed both films.It is pleasant to see a picture such as \\"Laburnum Grove\\" in these times because it captures, at least in fancy, a mellow slice of middle-class character and wit peculiar to less troubled days and less sober attitudes in films. Of course, you would hardly call the situation in \\"Laburnum Grove\\" a typical one in English domesticity, even without a war, for it finds a chipper little papa of a proper suburban family not only announcing himself as a counterfeiter but actually turning out to be one. And that is not exactly what you might have called run-of-mine.But the charmingly candid way in which Edmund Gwenn plays the shrewd old boy; the pudding-headed pomposity of Sir Cedric Hardwicke as his sponging brother-in-law, and the amusingly English femininities of Ethel Coleridge, Victoria Hopper and Katie Johnson make it a flip and flavorsome little comedy of manners and a nice little mystery poser, too. Why it had not been shown in New York before now is hard to say.In contrast, \\"A Letter From Home\\" is very real and deeply affecting. It begins with an American woman in an obvious New York apartment reading a letter from their mother to two little English evacuées—a letter in which the mother tells sketchily of her days, and ends with love and kisses and hopes that she may see them soon. And then the picture bridges to England and shows the activities of the mother from day-break to late at night—her patient, heroic perseverance in her home and as an air-raid warden, while her husband is away on naval duty and her children are far across the seas. It is a short picture—only seventeen minutes long—and it was made by Mr. Reed expressedly for the Bureau of Information, but it transmits a profound realization of the courage amid grave anxieties of England's undaunted women. Like \\"London Can Take It,\\" it is an eloquent tribute to a people's strength.Also on the program is a brief factual film showing the \\"Defenders of Tobruk\\"—a glimpse of the rugged Australians and their tenaciously held fortifications, which is especially interesting to see in the light of current news reports.

A profound wish to instill a love for learning and respect for academic achievement in inner-city children led her to start the school in 1975 with her own $5,000 retirement pension. An initial enrollment of 18 pupils has grown to more than 200 students today, and the location of the school in a room of her home has shifted to two school-owned buildings.    Ms. Collins will talk about her memories of Dr. King and his dream that children from all backgrounds would someday be taught together, inspired by a standard of excellence -- a dream that she shares.    Her school and the numerous articles that she wrote about the problems of education in America led to the filming of \\"The Marva Collins Story,\\" a 1985 television drama that starred Cicely Tyson.    Admission to the breakfast, which begins at 8 A.M. in the Fairview-Greenburgh Community Center at 32 Manhattan Avenue, is $40.

On Feb. 9 Robert Breen, a youth officer with the New Castle Police Department, will talk about home safety and the procedures to follow in case of fire or other threatening situations; and Sandra Kellogg, a psychiatric social worker, will speak about making responsible decisions as a baby sitter.

More than 150 of his black-and-white silver prints have been assembled for a retropective titled \\"Like a One-Eyed Cat: Photographs by Lee Friedlander 1956-1987\\" at the Neuberger Museum of the State University of New York in Purchase. The show opens with a reception today from 3 to 5 P.M. and continues through April 14.    His special vision -- like a one-eyed cat's -- attracts attention in odd ways, like including his own shadow in a series of self-portraits, as though he were looming over the viewer's shoulder to catch the reaction. He eschews fancy titles for his pictures and merely identifies them with a proper name and date, allowing space for the viewer's imagination.    Street scenes, jazz musicians, motels, factory workers, historic statues that have become incongruous to their locations, and other subjects that he elevates from the commonplace are depicted in the collection.    A lecture on the exhibition will be delivered at 3 P.M. today in the Humanities Building Auditorium by Deborah Martin Kao, an art historian in the fine arts department of Boston College. The talk, titled \\"Lee Friedlander's Factory Valley: Structure, Artifice, Culture,\\" will focus on the artist's approach to the sociological issues at the heart of his photographs. Admission is $7. Admission to the exhibition is free or by donation of $2. Museum hours are Tuesdays through Fridays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Saturdays and Sundays from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. For more information, call 251-6133 or 6100. COURTING FLUTE     The courting flute made by the Blackfoot-Narragansett Indians was so named because its tone resembled the mating call of the loon. At the end of the instrument a carving was always made in the shape of a loon, while other small animals were carved at the top.    TChin, an Indian who makes and plays courting flutes, will conduct a program of Indian storytelling and flute-playing from 1:30 to 4 P.M. today at Wave Hill in Riverdale. He will have several examples of old and new flutes on display and will play many of his own compositions as well as traditional Indian tunes.    He has a broad background in art and crafts, as a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design and the Institute of American Indian Art in Santa Fe, N.M., and through independent study with Indian elders nationwide.    The program will also feature a special art project -- finger puppet-making or drawing -- led by the resident Wave Hill artist Noah Baen. Hot chocolate and apple cider will be served afterward in front of a fire. Admission is $1 for adults and 50 cents for children.    Wave Hill is at 674 West 252d Street.

As it turned out, the Margrave not only failed to make Bach an attractive offer, but apparently had the concertos filed in his library without a playing - possibly because they presented technical demands that his orchestra could not meet.   Allan Kozinn writes frequently about music and musicians.  These days, of course, the Brandenburgs are so frequently performed and recorded that they have become almost emblematic of the Baroque orchestral esthetic. Their esteem has not been unfairly earned: Richly endowed with Bach's melodic and contrapuntal invention, they are marvels of the concerto grosso form","excerpt":"and taken as a set, they offer an extensive but concise overview of a good Baroque chamber orchestra's capabilities and timbral resources.

His weeks of wandering with two befriended bear cubs for companions through the frozen waste until searchers find him provide opportunities for unparalleled camera work. He clings to life chiefly because nature supplies his needs with what may best be described as Swiss Family Robinson forethought. As the doctor, Del Cambre's calm performance during the weeks of isolation is a welcome departure from the crazed frenzy that Hollywood usually demands of its stranded men.\\"King of Hockey\\" concerns a college hockey player who turns professional and then quits under the accusation of having accepted gamblers' bribes when in reality his poor play has been caused by failing eyesight due to a blow on the head.

It believes in itself, in its story, in its characters","excerpt":"and that belief pulls viewers into it. Sometimes they are pulled too hard, or in a certain embarrassment because the sequence is obvious or excessive or telegraphed in advance.But self-belief is an arousing quality, especially at a time when an extreme of baroque weariness gives movies such as \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" or Sam Peckinpah's \\"Killer Elite\\" the hopeless feeling that they are meant for an empty theater.\\"Distance,\\" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is set in a Georgia Army post in the mid-1950's. Its protagonist is Sergeant Horne, a black man whose natural force and ability have gone into building himself a shelter against the humiliations of being a Southern black of his time.The Army gives Horne a place where his energy and intelligence can be channeled and protected. Not fulfilled, though: here the haven becomes the prison. He is too good for his job, too much a perfectionist, and he is held to the company of men to whom he knows he is superior. One of the film's many inspired touches is a scene where Horne drinks beer with his fellow-sergeants — easygoing, cynical white men. They drink from cans; he drinks from a glass.The rigidity that is Horne's protection makes him a firstrate master sergeant, but it has made a torment of his private life. He has brought over a German wife, played gracefully and touchingly by Eija Pokkinen. He loves her or has loved her—the failure of the film quite to define their relationship is a weakness—but he has gradually closed himself to her.Her blond beauty, her gentleness and devotion are a lure and a goad. He needs to hurt her and be hurt by her. He burns like Othello, his fixation on his wife encompassing everything except the ability to see her as she is. He is his own lago; he devises his own jealousies. There is no Cassio except for a young white recruit who has the most casual brush with Mrs. Horne. The ending is tragic, predictably, and almost predictable.In fact, the tragic main plot is too pat and stagy, but it does have a use. It provides a gravely moving current that allows the film's real jewels—its freshness, its lovely characterizations, its splendid acting—to be set in something other than their own self-consciousness.Perhaps the best part of the film is the subplot. The white recruit, a bright, languid young man played by James Woods, has an affair with a woman who sleeps with base commanders in order to be allowed to sell insurance to the troops.It is a splendid affair, in which both the recruit and the woman harden and soften, touch and withdraw. The young man's self-sufficiency is almost pierced, and the woman's defenses almost give way to hope. The acting of James Wood is admirable, but Bibi Besch, as the woman, gives the top performance in the picture and somewhere up among the best of the year.As Sergeant Horne, Paul Benjamin provides force and passion, and some beauty. Less subtlety; but it is not Othello's function to be subtle.This is the first full-length feature by Anthony Lover and George Coe. Their initial effort was a short, \\"The Dove,\\" a charming and terribly funny takeoff on Ingmar Bergman, which is being shown along with \\"Distance.\\"There is no point describing it, other than to say that it's as if Bergman's symbols were holding a drunken cast party.

These conclusions are prompted by the Administration's decision not to ''superharden'' the existing Minuteman silos in which the first 40 MX's will be deployed.

Yet the Polish authorities' past record in the granting of amnesty - in particular, their conduct last year in the aftermath of a similar amnesty law - is hardly \\n\\n cause for optimism this time around.  It is natural to assume that the political prisoners who have been amnestied are convicted people who will now be able to leave prison, go home to their families and resume something very like their normal existence. In all likelihood, however, none of this is correct. The new amnesty law is identical, word for word, to the one passed exactly a year ago, and it may well be applied in a similarly harsh way.  What exactly happened last year? At the end of 1983, the Polish Government announced officially that the amnesty had been applied to 4,834 political offenders. (Neither then nor now has the Polish Government claimed that the amnesty covered all political prisoners.) The Government did not announce the names of any of the amnestied offenders, and their figures cannot easily be verified. Nevertheless, enough is known to show that the amnesty scarcely deserves its name.

But however much you may question the parroting of the lesson, you cannot deny the virility of their treatment or the visual effectiveness with which their directors, camera men and actors preach the majesty of Soviet history.\\"We Are From Kronstadt\\" is an October revolution in itself, being a further step in the Soviet cinema's progression from mass to individual action. Its hero, a sailor in the fleet stationed at Kronstadt, the Baltic Sea base, is the protagonist of all the Russian seamen whose interest in the Communist rebellion, at first lagging, is fanned to flame by the word and example of the veteran commissar who has come to the naval base to recruit his Petrograd defense corps.It is not until after his comrades are driven by the White soldiers to the top of a cliff and forced to jump into the sea, with their hands tied behind their backs and rocks strapped to their chests, that the sailor awakens to his party responsibility. Thence forward, through gripping scenes of battle, with the outnumbered Red forces holding their ground against the seemingly endless waves of marching counter-revolutionaries, the sailor is an avenging angel of destruction. The smashing climax is written when he leads the Kronstadt marines into battle and forces the Whites inexorably off the same sea cliff and, glaring defiantly after them, growls \\"And who else wants Petrograd?\\"The phrase had an ominous sound, but the preview audience which cheered the picture Thursday night accepted its militarist implications with complete enthusiasm and probably were remembering it yesterday when they met for tea in Union Square.

Statements by other high Vatican officials went even further than the pope's in condemning any imminent invasion, and in this case, unlike others that have divided Catholics, Rome had outspoken support from bishops around the world, most notably from those in the United States.    Catholics in many lands who were already inclined to oppose an American-led war welcomed the pope's declarations. Catholics who supported the war, it is reasonable to guess from reports in the secular and religious press, were led to think twice.    The approach of the conflict also ignited another round of debate on how to understand and apply the church's just-war teachings in an era of rogue states, transnational terrorism, frightening weapons easily hidden and transported, and a single military superpower.    So the pope's words did not fall into an absolute void. But they certainly did not provoke any vast crisis of conscience or even, apparently, a serious setback for the Republican White House's much vaunted ''Catholic strategy.'' Those who imagine that the Holocaust could have actually been halted by a clarion call from Pope Pius XII should take note.    The general impression is that many American Catholics were quite content to have a pope widely viewed as a peacemaker -- even as they were equally content to disagree with him.    This is not a measure of waning Catholic belief. No one was more ardent in buffering the American policy against Vatican criticism than Catholic neoconservatives whose admiration for the pope usually knows no bounds. They emphasized that the pope's primary responsibility was to ensure that moral principles remained part of the public debate and that all peaceful remedies were given a fair chance.    On the other hand, they insisted, responsibility for making the factual estimates and prudent judgments needed to apply those principles always remained with laypeople and knowledgeable public authorities.     Vatican worries about the effects of the war were understandable, said George Weigel, the pope's semiofficial biographer and consistent defender. But ''reasonable people can have different views about the effects,'' he said in an interview during the war.    Arguments like Mr. Weigel's are familiar enough. But they had usually been found in the mouths of liberal Catholic thinkers, who were now enjoying the sight of neoconservatives suddenly discovering important qualifications in their usual enthusiasm for papal leadership.    Beyond the inconsistencies revealed by this internal Catholic clash between liberal and neoconservative intellectuals, is there anything more to say about the pope's moral leadership in matters of war and peace, and its apparently limited effect?    First, it should be noted that in this matter as well as others, the Vatican cannot rely on papal prestige and authority. Many an opinion poll show that American Catholics in particular have to be persuaded, not told","excerpt":"and that would probably have required offering much more specific ideas about dealing with the lethal formula -- hostile states, terrorist groups and immensely destructive portable weapons -- that the Bush administration had made the centerpiece of its case for the war.    Second, John Paul II's own position on the use of military force is not very clear. This son of a Polish officer is not a pacifist. He has defended nations' right to self-defense, and he allows that military force may be needed in some instances of humanitarian intervention. Yet he is also given to broad antiwar declarations that have a pacifist ring. One suspects that the experience of Poland has fed a conviction that persistent nonmilitary resistance can ultimately triumph even over a police state with superpower backing.    This ambivalence gives the pope's public positions on war and peace a somewhat ad hoc character that may weaken their impact on Catholic opinion. Some church leaders have wondered whether a high-level Vatican conference or even a papal encyclical on the current state of the church's traditional just-war teaching may be in order.    Finally, the pope's moral leadership in this area remains tightly tied to the exercise of Vatican diplomacy. In other words, rather than focusing largely on shaping the views of Catholics and their morally concerned fellow citizens, it focuses more on addressing governments, usually behind closed doors.     Is that a mistaken focus? Throughout all the debates over the role of Pope Pius XII during World War II, this tension between dramatic moral proclamation by the pope and the Vatican's commitment to peacemaking through diplomacy has been apparent. Even under a very different pope like John Paul II, the tension apparently continues.

The Cincinnati players had better hope their boss doesn't start criticizing them for being missing in action as well.   For when it came time to be counted in those games, the Reds, simply put, were outhit, outpitched, outfielded and, in general, outclassed by the playoff-toughened Atlanta Braves. Because the Reds were practically no-shows, the Braves are just two victories away from the World Series.   Atlanta's 6-2, 10-inning victory Wednesday night made it the seventh team ever to win the initial two games on the road in an N.L.C.S., and the first since the four-of-seven-game format was adopted in 1985.   Though it took the Braves extra innings to win both games, too often it seemed the contests were between men and boys. Cincinnati was limited to three runs in 21 innings. Its bullpen lost twice and blew a save opportunity.   When the Braves had finished their work in a surprisingly ambivalent Cincinnati on Wednesday, they left the birthplace of major league baseball and flew here hoping to win two more games and clinch their third pennant in five years.   Game 3 will be played Friday night, with the Braves' Greg Maddux starting against David Wells. Game 4 will be Saturday night, and if Game 5 is necessary it will be played Sunday.   What those bothering to attend saw in Cincinnati was a team well-schooled in late-game heroics. It was not the Reds, who were 10-3 in extra innings this season. It was the Braves, although they were only 3-9 in extra innings in the regular season.   On Tuesday, Atlanta won by 2-1 in the 11th inning. On Wednesday it was a 6-2 victory made possible by a bases-loaded wild pitch by the Reds' Mark Portugal and a three-run homer by Atlanta catcher Javier Lopez.   The Braves have won all four road games this post-season in their last times at bat. They won 27 games that way this season.   \\"We've been there so many times before, I think the guys have just become used to doing it this way,\\" Lopez said.   History says the Reds likely can do little to prevent the Braves from advancing. The only teams to jump to a 2-0 advantage in league championship play but fail to advance to the World Series were the 1984 Chicago Cubs, who lost to the San Diego Padres in a three-of-five-game series","excerpt":"and the 1985 Los Angeles Dodgers, who lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in six games.   It cannot help the Reds' psyche that to get back into this series they must find a way to solve Maddux, who was 19-2 this season. Conversely, the Braves could not be blamed if they were already thinking sweep simply because Maddux is on their side.   Still, Lopez said: \\"Sure, it's a good feeling, but we can't take anything for granted. We still have to play hard. The Reds are capable of coming back.\\"   The Reds cautiously agreed while waiting to send a third straight left-hander, Wells, to the mound Friday night.   \\"Being down 2-0 and going into Atlanta is a tough task,\\" said the Reds' Barry Larkin. \\"I'm sure it will be reported that this is over, but this team has been resilient all year. We have to go out and try not to press.\\"   They also have to try to hit. Thus far the Reds are hitting .236 and have 17 hits in two games; Larkin has five of them. Of the 17 hits, only 5 were for extra bases; 3 of those belonged to Larkin, who has doubled twice and tripled.

Now he is a candidate to wear the goat's horns if the Reds fail.   Sanders is 1 for 9 in the series. He has struck out five times and stranded seven runners, including three in extra innings. Sanders, struggling even before seeing Atlanta, has struck out 14 times in five post-season games dating to Cincinnati's three-game sweep of the Dodgers in the first round. Ten of those strikeouts have come in his last three games.   \\"This is the time of year when you're supposed to shine,\\" Sanders said after his four strikeouts Wednesday. \\"We've worked so hard to get to this point, so why press? I know what I'm doing wrong, but it's just a matter of going out and trying to be successful at correcting it.\\"   The Reds are left not only to figure out how to win, but how to fill Riverfront Stadium should the series return for Games 6 and 7.    After all, on Tuesday, the Reds sold only 40,382 seats in a stadium built to hold 52,952, leaving the upper deck empty between the foul poles. It was the smallest post-season crowd ever in the Queen City. Wednesday, the Reds sold 44,624 tickets; only 43,257 fans showed.   Reds General Manager Jim Bowden blamed residual anger over the strike of 1994-95. \\"We're the ones to blame,\\" Bowden told reporters Wednesday as his club tried to peddle 15,000 tickets for that night's game. \\"That's a result of what we've done to the game.\\"   \\"If they're still disgusted, I don't blame them because as a player I was disgusted, too,\\" said Atlanta's Tom Glavine, a player negotiator during the work stoppage that pre-empted the last third of the '94 season, the playoffs and World Series, then disrupted spring training and shortened this season by 211 games.   Other post-season cities, including Seattle, which the Mariners might leave, are drawing well. Cincinnati, obviously more conservative, wasn't as lucky.   \\"This is a great baseball town,\\" Bowden said. \\"For that to happen in the playoffs is a shame.\\" Way Up in the Stands And Down on the Field, Reds Get Empty Feeling"},{"year":"1982","title":"The Interzonal Tournament in Moscow was really over for both Gari Kasparov, a Soviet grandmaster, and Dragoljub Velimirovic, a Yugoslav grandmaster, when they met in the last round.

Books of The Times; Plagiarism as the Metaphor for a Litigious Era"},{"year":"1970","title":"\\"Chikamatzu Monogatari,\\" which played yesterday afternoon at the New York Film Festival, is a story from the work of the Kabuki dramatist Chikamatzu Monzaemon (1653-1724), who, according to one text, is considered the Japanese Shakespeare. Compared with the films of Kenji Mizoguchi with which we are already familiar (for example, \\"Ugetzu\\"—1953, \\"The Bailiff\\"—1954, or the sublime \\"Life of O'Haru\\" — 1952), \\"Chikamatzu Monogatari,\\" made in 1954, seems less lyrically poetic, less picturesquely strange, less immediately beautiful. But on the basis of just one viewing, I should guess that it is no less great.It is, however, enough different in feeling to deserve some description. It is the story of how the scrollmaker Mohei, in attempting to help his master's wife out of a financial embarrassment, is virtually forced into running away with her so that he becomes indeed the adulterous lover of a woman he has long worshipped in secret.The couple have no peace, partly because the husband's position will not allow the dishonor, and in time they are returned (with the help of Mohei's father), and, as is the custom with adulterers of a certain rank, they are taken off in ritual procession to be crucified. The husband is ruined anyway, and as the film ends, his scroll factory, the most prosperous in the imperial city of Kyoto, is confiscated.For much of its length, \\"Chikamatzu Monogatari\\" takes place within a single household, and it is given to a massive exploration of the master scrollmaker's office, workrooms, kitchen, and living quarters. The interiors at times resemble a constructivist stage set, with its allocation of levels, spaces, and connecting stairways","excerpt":"and the action, at least up until the actual flight, borders on the edge of bedroom comedy.It is only after the flight—and especially during one breathtaking scene at night in a small boat, when the couple decided against suicide and suddenly learn that they are lovers—that the film opens out, just for a few moments at a time, into that gorgeous misty countryside that we have come to expect as the metaphysical universe of the Mizoguchi dramas.I think the reason is that \\"Chikamatzu Monogatari\\" is in profound ways really about the rigorous complexity of its interiors and courtyards; that it is about relationships (man-woman, brother-sister, child-parent, servant-master) and responsibilities, and about the absolutely fantastic interdependency of everything upon everything else. Therefore, the film's appearance is moment-by-moment an extension of its theme, and the stultifying closeness of every life with every other above it, below it, and next to it is in fact the metaphysical universe of this particular Mizoguchi drama.That universe is somehow incomplete without its adulterous lovers (we see one pair at the beginning of the film, and then, of course, the hero and heroine at the end) and their sacrificial murders. They stand as if for all the potential of a responsive personal life that is rigorously excluded from the social structure of the public and familial worlds. They are outlaws and yet they are representative (everybody's life in \\"Chikamatzu Monogatari,\\" just below the surface is, or could be, a mess); they are dangerous and beautiful; they are necessary—and they are genuinely intolerable. The master scrollmaker Ishun, an unpleasant character is brought to ruin because he has been cuckolded — and his punishishment is not less real, or less unjust, than his wife's.I don't want to give the impression that \\"Chickamatzu Monogatari\\" is all scheme (though it is highly schematic) and without more sensuous pleasures. The performances are graceful, gentle, individualized and lovely. The music, which is mostly Japanese, ranks with the most expressive I have ever heard in a film. And the look of the film, indoors or out, is like a tribute to the traditions of Japanese genre painting and the pictorial logic of the old almost square-shaped movie screen.During the main title credits to Lasse Forsberg's \\"Mistreatment,\\" which played last night at the New York Film Festival, a sign flashes on the screen to announce that \\"the actors are responsible for their lines.\\" In so far as this is true, and at the press-screening news conference Forsberg assured the audience that it is quite true, \\"Mistreatment\\" is blessed with a remarkably articulate group of actors. And the most remarkable is Knut Pettersen, a nonprofessional (though he has had some training) with a fine aggressive manner and a notable ability to talk his head off.Pettersen plays a 31-year-old Stockholm radical who one day assaults the owner of a Jaguar (class exploitation; Pettersen figures the car is rightly his) and six months later, after several polite interrogations and much psychological testing, finds himself strapped and drugged in a progressive and well-managed state insane asylum.The central question of who's really insane (a question suggested by the film's title) is complicated by the fact that Pettersen picks his fights, mercilessly abuses the official machinery intended to help him, turns social awareness into paranoia, and generally acts as crazy as the well-adjusted types around him seem to think he is. He writes dreadful tracts full of revolutionary insight, in his personal accusations he is unjust, and he makes difficulties where none seem to exist. But he has the wisdom of his maladjustment, and each time he feels himself trapped, it turns out that there is indeed a cage to hold him. He is in some degree a function of the society he protests, and it is proper to ask of him not the blueprint for a brave new world, but a few truculent insights into this one.I greatly like the Pettersen character (and I greatly like Pettersen), but I am not so impressed with his revolutionary peer (Bjorn Granath) or the pleasant shop girl (Berit Persson) whom Bjorn seduces and abandons as a chapter in his own more cerebral protest diary.Most of Forsberg's dullest filmmaking centers on this pair, who live together in an apartment decorated like a handbook in revolutionary rhetoric, and who, even in bed, do uninteresting things with one another. In its subplot, if you will, \\"Mistreatment\\" too often settles for elaborate but inexpressive gestures and for the kind of empty irony that sometimes gives young filmmakers a bad name.Forsberg isn't all that young (37), but this is his first feature—and it is important not for its failures but for moments of success, which are unusual, difficult, and most moving when apparently most annoying. Much of \\"Mistreatment\\" looks like a lot of other recent movies (the new freedom in subject matter has led, of course, to the most boring insistence on relevance) but where it becomes individual, and almost always where it is informed by the mind and style of Knut Pettersen, it is funny, strong and healthfully uncomfortable.

In slow motion, a ne'er-do-well viscously seeps out of the crowd, lifts a gun as if in a television police show, steadies it with both arms, and fires. King's body jerks with the studied rebounds now made famous by films of the John F. Kennedy assassination, and falls across his podium.   It is, I think, one of those moments that help to explain a large number of things about the opera, not the least of them being its enormous success -first in Rotterdam, then at Artpark near Buffalo and, finally, last month at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where 10,000 tickets to five performances were sold out and where, no doubt, more could have easily been sold.

THE HUNTERS: Two Short Novels, by Claire Messud. (Harcourt, $23.)

But a couple of them may prove disquieting because of the imitative bents they reveal.Excellent among the lot—which, incidentally, was screened for critics the other day after the awards had been voted by a jury, following a two-night judging session—are a 12-minute documentary, \\"Riff '65,\\" and its runner-up, a 15-minute documentary, \\"The Season,\\" which is a gem.\\"Riff '65,\\" made by Eric Camiel, a 23-year-old from New York University, is a subtle, poetic study of an American Indian boy living in Harlem. \\"The Season,\\" directed by Donald MacDonald, 23, of the University of California at Los Angeles, is a serio-comic contemplation of certain aspects of Christmas in Los Angeles. Remember \\"Mondo Cane\\" and its display of California freaks? This little film, in color, adds some new ones, which are grotesque and sad.The winner as the best dramatic picture is \\"Match Girl,\\" made by Andrew Meyer, 22, of Boston University. It is a complex and adroit visualization of the fantasy experiences of an aspiring young actress, done in color and with a dandy musical accompaniment by the Rolling Stones. This one, with some further story values, could be stretched into a fetching full-length film.The winner as the best animated is a cute little six-minute job, \\"A Child's Introduction to the Cosmos,\\" made by Hal Barwood, 24, of the University of Southern California","excerpt":"and the award for the best experimental goes to \\"Metanomen,\\" an eight-minute black-and-white film, done by Scott Bartless, 23, of San Francisco State College. This shows a vagrant disposition to imitate the older French expressionists.The winner of the certificate of merit in the dramatic class is another that is an obvious imitation of the early films of Alain Resnais. It is \\"Forward Voyager,\\" and it was made by Sterling Norris, 31, of U.C.L.A. In 24 minutes, it tells of a German woman in California who fears to give her love to a parachute jumper because she was previously in love with a German who was killed. And \\"Lost in Cuddihy,\\" a 14-minute experimental by Ira Schneider, 27, of the University of Wisconsin, betrays a too slavish imitation of the Andy Warhol-Jonas Mekas techniques.These winners were selected from 34 finalists that had been culled from more than 125 entries submitted from 44 colleges and universities.Tickets for the screening this evening, which will begin at 8:30, are $2, $1.50 for students.

Leave it to the Russian film-makers. According to Artkino, the distributors, there is another new feature on the same event yet to come our way. This makes three!Saturday's entry at the Cameo Theatre, for purposes of plain entertainment, is an improvement over its predecessor, simply because it sticks more closely to the immediate business at hand-big-top specialties. And the acts themselves, representing eleven countries, are increasingly astounding. The Russian home artists come close to dominating the picture, but the quieter, more exotic wizardy of the Chinese visitors steals the show. And show it is.Another nicely colored project, the documentary opens with a Polish circus motorcade rolling into Moscow. The remainder of the film hops from various outdoor and indoor enclosures where the performers are staging nearly every conceivable kind of big-top stunt. Unlike \\"Festival in Moscow,\\" city sight-seeing is briskly kept to a minimum.The camera generally hovers between the rapt audiences and the circus folk.

Finland, Germany and Sweden also make brief, if sturdy, contributions.The Russian hosts, in the climax, put on the most spectacular show inside a stunningly designed greenish hippodrome. Here, even with one ring, is the ideal circus sanctuary, with probably the world's best-looking blonde aerialist, shown in a breathtaking dive almost to the ground.That done a waterfall floods the pit for a Soviet-style aquacade, complete with clowns, and a lady tiger-trainer who swims her pet around the rim, hugging him joyously. Apparently tigers prefer blondes, too.But the most striking skill (and perhaps courage) is shown by a truly remarkable Chinese juggler, with four acrobat\\" colleagues running him a close second.

And now that anyone may examine it at the Trans-Lux 85th, the Apollo, the Eighth Street Playhouse and two other theaters in the metropolitan area, where it opened yesterday, the question most likely to rise in the mind of the average viewer is what was all the shooting about.I don't mean the melodramatic shooting that comes at the end of the film—though there may be some reasonable question as to why and how that occurs. I mean the shooting done by the censors at this simple, sincere little film that is nothing more than a stark illumination of the fine line between love and hate.In a most restrained way, it tells a story of a young and pretty woman who lives alone in a house by a lake in the country. One day a strange man comes by and, seeing the lonely situation, invites himself in out of the rain. The woman is quietly hospitable and allows him to remain overnight. He stays on the next day and the next day. Pretty soon the woman begins to fall in love.During this period of muted courtship, the woman painfully reveals that she is an unappeased war widow. Her husband, who was with the underground, was captured, tortured and finally executed by one of his own countrymen. She cannot get over the horror of it or the memory of her love. The man, a pleasant, stolid fellow, tells little about himself.In a state of mixed emotion, the woman allows herself to be seduced, and, from this rather guarded surrender, proceeds to have an affair with the man. Then one night, while the two are pursuing an act of somewhat casual intercourse, she discovers from an unusual scar on his shoulder, that he is her husband's murderer.It is this crucial scene of harsh discovery in the midst of the most tender intimacy that was objected to by the censor. And since it could not be cut without killing the whole point of the drama, the distributor of the film fought the ban.Yes, the scene, as played in medium-close shots with the woman fully clothed, is necessarily explicit as to what is going on. An exposition of the woman's emotions is essential to the anguish of the scene. But it is not played to be lascivious. It gives a frank and artful realization of the manner in which the urges of the body may be strangled by the tortures of the mind. It shows how brutally the psyche may be shocked out of a condition of trust.That's all there is to the picture—that and the melodramatic end, which is actually rather anticlimactic and somewhat incredible. And anybody who goes to see it expecting to be cheaply entertained is going to find himself looking sadly at a mature and deeply poignant glimpse of life.Birgitte Federspiel as the woman and Preben Lerdorff Rye as the man give calm, sensitive, clear and true performances under the direction of Johan Jacobsen. The naturalistic setting is simple—a little house and its surroundings, that is all","excerpt":"and the English subtitles are sufficient for the spare Danish dialogue.If the censor hadn't advertised this picture with his technical-minded ban, it would have got no more than the sensible, respectful, grown-up attention it deserves.

Of these only three, comparatively early works, have opened here. But now Hani's first feature, \\"A Full Life,\\" made in 1962, is being introduced at the New Yorker, to play with Ozu's \\"A Tokyo Story.\\" Together they make a very long, demanding and wonderfully rewarding double bill.Hani's work seems to waver between the expression of a decent, optimistic and slightly deadly liberal humanitarianism (as in \\"Bwana Toshi,\\" 1965)","excerpt":"and the exploration of an intense, personal, somewhat idealized eroticism (as in \\"The Inferno of First Love,\\" 1968). From their titles the more recent Hani films (\\"Aido, Slave of Love,\\" \\"The Grand Adventure of Love\\"—both unreleased here) would seem to lean toward the latter concerns. But \\"A Full Life,\\" in very responsible ways, balances the claims of public and private interests, and even makes its meaning from a conflict that perhaps remains unsettled — profitably unsettled—in the director's mind.The public interests are political, the growth of a leftist activism against the signing of the United States-Japanese security pact in the spring of 1960. Into all this wanders the heroine (played by Ineko Arima), a young Tokyo housewife, a former actress, who is leaving her husband and wants to return to the theater because she needs the income and doesn't really know anything else to do.Essentially the film follows the passage of her days — visits with friends, meetings with her husband, tryouts, a few menial acting jobs, discontent, frustration, involvement with a number of men including the director of her troupe (played by Koshiro Harada), who happens to be her destiny.Making the most of its episodic structure, \\"A Full Life\\" is in fact over-full—of people, personal vignettes, and all the urban activity sometimes quite enviable activity, that merely demonstrates the emptiness underneath. When the actress finally wins her happiness, it is only at the cost of her freedom. But freedom, like its loss, is a condition open to question, and subject to level upon level of ironic contemplation.In Hani's treatment, such contemplation is not always exciting, but it is never less than interesting and often funny, and endlessly alert to the great modern city with its false promises and real satisfactions. Sometimes \\"A Full Life\\" is too fashionably handsome (in the early 1960's movies tended toward striking composition) and sometimes it is too schematic. But it keeps opening up into lovely modest discoveries about its people and the worlds they shape to their own needs and desires.The cast is very fine, with many superb minor portraits. Only Ineko Arima has what I guess you'd call a major role, and she achieves an understated tour de force in turning a performance into a subtle personality. Screen: 'A Full Life' and Hani Imprint"},{"year":"1992","title":"Passing the Gift On     We may imagine the most humane elements of our nature originate with us. In fact, they are an inheritance preserved and passed down by each generation, according to a character in the story \\"The Cardinal's Third Tale,\\" included in \\"Last Tales\\" by Isak Dinesen (Vintage, paper).   There are many things in life which a human being . . . may attain by personal endeavor. But there exists a true humanity, which will ever remain a gift, and which is to be accepted by one human being as it is given to him by a fellow human. The one who gives has himself been a receiver. In this way, link by link, a chain is made from land to land and from generation to generation. Rank, wealth and nationality in this matter all go for nothing. The poor and downtrodden can hand over the gift to kings, and kings will pass it on to their favorites at Court or to an itinerant dancer in their city. . . . Strange and wonderful is it to consider how in such community we are bound to foreigners whom we have never seen and to dead men and women whose names we have never heard and shall never hear, more closely even than if we were all holding hands. Art's True Purpose     It isn't art's business to show us the world, Oscar Wilde asserted in an 1889 essay on Shakespeare: its true purpose is to hold up a mirror to our souls. This is from \\"The Fireworks of Oscar Wilde,\\" edited by Owen Dudley Edwards (Barrie & Jenkins/Trafalgar Square, paper).   We become lovers when we see Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet makes us students. The blood of Duncan is upon our hands, with Timon we rage against the world, and when Lear wanders out upon the heath the terror of madness touches us. Ours is the white sinlessness of Desdemona, and ours, also, the sin of Iago. Art, even the art of fullest scope and widest vision, can never really show us the external world. All that it shows us is our own soul, the one world of which we have any real cognizance. . . . It is Art, and Art only, that reveals us to ourselves. Touching the Past       It is in the study of our local history, the artifacts and buildings of our immediate surroundings, that we come closest to an encounter with the past. This is from a 1927 essay by Lewis Mumford, included in \\"Hudson Valley Lives,\\" edited by Bon nie Marranca (Overlook).   The things that we can see and touch are those that awaken our imagination. . . . Nothing has ever made me, for one, feel the might of the Roman Empire more keenly than stumbling across the tiles and foundations of a Roman villa in the midst of a quiet English field. Local history touches off these things that have happened on the spot","excerpt":"and the facts of local history become parts of a person's own life to an extent which is rare with scenes and incidents one has taken out of books and secondhand accounts. . . . Every old part of the country is filled with the memorials of our past: tombstones and cottages and churches, names and legends, old roads and trails and abandoned mines, as well as the things we built and used yesterday. All these memorials bring us closer to the past and, so doing, they bring us closer to our own present; for we are living history as well as recording it; and our memories are as necessary as our anticipations. Our Home in the Desert       We may never have traveled to a desert, but the idea of that landscape as a place of stark clarity, and of struggle, haunts our imaginations, according to Charles Bowden in his memoir \\"De sierto: Memories of the Future\\" (Norton).   Deserts can be very specific places for a botanist or a zoologist. But not for most of us. We tend to see deserts as a quality more than a place. To go off into the desert in our language means not to visit a locale, but a state of mind. And so if we consider a very specific desert, the Sonoran, and a very specific place, El Camino del Diablo, we still cannot really contain ourselves with bundles of the specifics -- checklists of plants, and animals, weather reports of startling June days and cold January nights. That is why when we read the . . . Bible, a very early collection of desert writings, we feel an eerie kinship with the wandering Hebrews. Not in the promised land. Not in Egypt. Not in Babylon. But in the Sinai. Every one of us, regardless of where we are sitting on this planet, no matter what the birds are trilling in the green forest outside our window, every one of us snaps alert with a clear sense of the ground when the Hebrews enter Sinai and begin their long trial by God in the desert.  Fragrant, Delicious Words       Language and food are so intertwined, it is now hard to imagine one without the other. This is from \\"The Secret Life of Food: A Feast of Food and Drink History, Folklore and Fact\\" by Martin Elkort (Tarcher, paper).   The English language is marinated in food words; words that describe food and its qualities and also serve as reliable metaphors and similes when other words fail. How many breathless poets and tongue-tied lovers have compared the lips of their beloved to cherries, their cheeks to peaches? How many call their beloved honey, or sugar, to express tenderness or curry favor? How many babies are the apple of their parents' eyes, who regularly bring home the bacon, to provide a nest egg for their brood? How many people feel sheepish if they do something wrong, and have to eat humble pie in atonement? . . . From the time the first caveman grunted in appreciation as he came upon a berry-laden bush, we have been searching for the right word to describe and classify each fruit, each vegetable and each food animal. The search for food builds a strong appetite for words to describe them, and the words themselves become capable of stimulating the appetite by bringing forth fragrant, delicious images.

ANTON CHEKHOV'S father was an unsuccessful grocer in Taganrog, a somnolent seaport in southern Russia that by the mid 19th century had lost whatever prosperity it had once enjoyed. He was also a domestic tyrant who beat his children virtually every day, in the conviction that he was carrying out the will of God, and who forced them to spend long hours toiling in his grimy little shop under dismal conditions - on one occasion, when a rat drowned in a barrel of oil, he sent for a priest to recite a purification ritual so he could continue offering the oil for sale.   In spite of all this he was not without his affectionate impulses or his abilities (he taught himself to play the violin, for instance), and later in life his famous son was able to look back at him with remarkably little resentment. But at the same time Chekhov's childhood was overshadowed by hardship and fear","excerpt":"and the family's situation became even more wretched during his adolescence when it moved to Moscow (where his father had decamped to avoid being thrown into prison for debt).

Made in Germany early last year, this is an ice-cold work, and a stubborn and difficult one. The meager rewards it delivers are no match for the enormous energy it demands.Beginning and ending with a quotation from the French avant-gardist Antonin Artaud, to the effect that thinking from a non-human point of view is a way of maintaining contact with the gods, \\"Satan's Brew\\" operates as something of a sicko sit-com, with a set of domestic characters nonchalantly acting out their most bestial impulses.Walter Kranz (Kurt Raab) is a beleaguered poet with a hefty wife who complains loudly about their non-existent sex life and a brother whose hobbies are exposing himself and collecting dead flies.The menagerie also includes a duplicitous whore and a bug-eyed, warty mistress (played through heavy makeup by the usually stunning Margit Carstensen). Kranz himself is hard at work pretending he is Stefan George, a German poet favored by the Nazis, and writing a new opus, to be entitled \\"No Ceremony For The Führer's Dead Dog.\\"Mr. Fassbinder can be both ironic and provocative when, as in \\"Mother Kusters Goes To Heaven,\\" his only successful comedy, he gently contrasts people's manners with their desires. But in \\"Satan's Brew\\" his blunt directorial style merely exaggerates the coarseness of his characters, and his humor turns stolid and didactic. There are, for instance, a great many ponderous lessons here about the relationship between sex and money: a woman in kinky purple underwear goes into ecstasies while writing a check (at this point, her lover serenely shoots her), and the brother who collects flies tries to use them as both erotic offerings and as currency.Mr. Fassbinder also pokes fun at a wide range of perversions: one character, a masochist, has scrambled egg spat onto her face and happily lets it dry there. Also, there are repeated digs at the German national temperament, including several references to anti-Semitism and someone's scornful appraisal of death as \\"the fate of the weak.\\" It's hard to be sure where Mr. Fassbinder stands on these or any other issues, because the film's plot is unintelligible and its directorial vantage point is somewhere off in the ozone. For all its brutishness, though, \\"Satan's Brew\\" is finally not vulgar enough. The film's premise calls for both precision and abandon and, while an exaggerated, reference-laden meticulousness is Mr. Fassbinder's specialty, he seems incapable of doing anything very freely. His characters follow their animal instincts, but they do so in such a careful way they might as well be trained seals. None of them flouts convention with the kind of spontaneity or enthusiasm that might have lent real wit to the film's bloodless, brittle scheme.

Yet I am not as solid as usual - not    quite    such an oaf, - because there is at the back of my mind all the time (slightly lifting the top off my head,) a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog, and I have to reach out to it again, take it in my hands and feel its contours: then it hardens, ''Virginia is coming on Saturday.''

The complaint that legal scholarship is too theoretical to be important is misfounded. Although the academic esthetic does not always adapt well to the more immediate demands of the legal practitioner, there is nevertheless an intricate dialogue between evolutions in legal scholarship and evolutions in the courts.    For example, the fate of Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court ultimately rested on a highly theoretical concern over the proper role of the Constitution and the courts in American society.   The argument that the students who edit and manage the vast majority of law journals lack the expertise to distinguish truly important legal scholarship is similarly misfounded. Expertise in law is different from that in biochemistry. Like most journals, ours has a staff with advanced degrees in many law-related disciplines, and during my tenure we have not had to reject any article because it was too sophisticated for our staff to comprehend. More important, in a society in which we long ago decided that our most pressing legal decisions -- like abortion and racial equality -- would be subject to some degree of popular scrutiny, even the most advanced legal thought must ultimately be accessible to people of diverse academic backgrounds. Expertise in legal scholarship is therefore characterized principally by clarity of thought and expression.   Law review articles are \\"boring\\" because, for the most part, the law is boring. The law is a conglomeration of disciplines, whose interrelationship is quite ethereal. Even the most devoted of legal scholars is involved in only a fraction of the sum of legal concerns.   Legal scholarship has its limitations. Space constraints favor smaller articles","excerpt":"and the limited tenure of editors inhibits the evolution of more efficient and user-friendly production processes. But overall, the product of student-run journals follows rather than leads the demands of legal academia, both in its good points and in its bad. MICHAEL W.

The movie is a kind of treatise on a section of Paris, the 20th Arrondissement, where new lower-middle-class buildings are going up, and a girl (Marina Vlady) who lives there. Godard's voice supplies a partial narration, in a tense whisper, about problems that preoccupy him now: language, politics, comic-strip imagery, appearance and reality. The characters more or less interview one another, or are interviewed by an interlocutor off camera, mainly about questions of identity and sex. The photography, in color, by Raoul Coutard, is beautiful, clear comic-book precise","excerpt":"and the locations—a dress shop, a beauty parlor, the interior of a coffee cup—are informed by Godard's signature.There is an almost intolerable, conscious tension in Godard's work now between word and picture: one's attention is so riveted to the work onscreen that Godard seems to think he can afford to freight it—at one point he speaks of himself as a painter and a writer—with a verbal text that takes off at right angles and includes almost anything that he would care to say.The trouble is that, except for a few funny pieces of dialogue, the offscreen interview doesn't work too well in this one, and that Godard, as a philosopher and something of a political dogmatist, treats questions of philosophy—How do I know that I exist? Can there be a private language, and so on — as though works from Berkeley to Wittgenstein had not gone before. There are a few interesting reflections about the limits of language and the first principles of the universe, but most of it seems affected and rather tedious. Also, a whisper is not very well suited, over the long haul, to discussions of philosophy.There is certainly enough of wit and beauty, though, to keep the film afloat, and for people who are interested in what interests Godard, there is a particularly patent, conscious (Godard seems always conscious) ambiguity now in what he feels about America. The text is almost detestingly anti, and yet American shoes, and cigarettes, and styles and Cokes are treated by the camera with the feeling that nature lovers reserve for rocks and trees. It is this nailing of attention with something you cannot help wanting to see burdened by a text of words you may not care to hear, that does not work too well this time, seems even superficial, but is a direction worth exploring all the same.

It should be clear that the ''development of    taste  '' is an abstraction. To set before oneself the goal of being able to enjoy, and in the proper objective order of merit, all good poetry, is to pursue a phantom, the chase after which should be left to those whose ambition it is to be ''cultivated'' or ''cultured,'' for whom art is a luxury article and its appreciation an accomplishment.

Australia is so far beyond the exclusive claims of either the Old World or the New that it may be impossible to live there as anything but a stranger. In this fine second novel by Tim Winton, the 1984 winner of Australia's Miles Franklin Award, a young woman named Queenie Coupar, fifth-generation inhabitant of an Australian whaling town called Angelus, abandons her job as a local tour guide and joins a group of foreign environmentalists who have come to shut down the town's commerce. Thus, for reasons buried and unnamed, she alienates herself from even the common strangeness of her own people. Her grandfather, Daniel, who raised Queenie as his own daughter, broods on the distant lies surrounding his wife's death and nurtures the bitterness of a youthful rebellion that came to naught. Queenie's husband, Cleve, is generally despised as dim and ineffectual. During his night watch on the town pier he reads a journal written a century and a half earlier by Daniel's ancestor - a whaler and maritime deserter who speaks to Cleve's evolving comprehension of the things which make men guilty and survive. Mr. Winton is not always in control of the material. His metaphors are relentlessly literary, from the symbolism of the whales to the sexual sterility of ruthless and decadent tycoons","excerpt":"and the narrative sometimes lingers over pastoral moments while cascading across crucial ones -such as Cleve's search for the journal's missing years - in fewer than two pages.

BY BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE LONDON American playgoers, lately accustomed to one doleful bulletin after another emanating from Broadway, are sometimes inclined to regard the London theater as a sort of bustling gymnasium for the hale and hearty: cheap seats, an abundance of fine work, smiling managers whose only problem is whether to cast Gielgud or Olivier in the new Stoppard, Ayckbourn or Simon Gray.   That is not, however, the view of London theater in London itself.  On the contrary, usually resilient impresarios are admitting to feeling distinctly glum these days as they peer out of their eyries in Shaftesbury Avenue and into the year ahead.   Here a vital distinction must be made. For Britain's two main subsidized companies, things look more bullish than for some time.  Both are to receive larger grants than they dared hope from the Government-sponsored Arts Council during the coming financial year: $9.9 million for the National Theater, $5.5 million for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

The evidence is contained in two studies in the July-August 1986 issue of her institute's bimonthly research journal, Family Planning Perspectives, one by Deborah Anne Dawson and the other by William Marsiglio and Frank L. Mott.   Each study covers thousands of teen-agers exposed to sex education programs that either provided them with condoms or told them how and where to obtain them.    Based on the more plausible of two alternative assumptions, Ms. Dawson concludes that exposure to programs of this sort \\"increases the odds of starting intercourse at 14 by a factor of 1.5.\\"   And Mr. Marsiglio and Mr. Mott conclude that such exposure is \\"positively and significantly associated with the initiation of sexual activity at age 15 and 16,\\" increasing the odds by at least 20 percent.

For example, Aristotle, who died in 322 B.C., in another age and another time, said that ''some men are by nature free and others slaves,'' and that for the latter ''slavery is both expedient and right.''

It was written by Ed Sullivan in his best water-under-the-bridge style, which, as yol know, is extremely first-personal, quite sentimental and edifyingly moralistic. His subject is a self-made gangster who realizes too late—on the threshold of the death chamber, in fact—that crime doesn't pay. The gang lord's kid brother has been drawn into the racket and killed, his poor old father and mother are heart-broken, the girl who once loved him has turned sadly away. Only Ed Sullivan, columnist and Greek chorus of the film, remains to pen his memoirs and append the moral to his tale.Barton MacLane plays the gangster with a polish achieved through constant usage of the route. Oscar O'Shea and Esther Dale, as the parents, have a poignant scene or two, and Eve Arden, as the girl who knew the gangster when, does her best to give some substance to a basically unsubstantial part. The casting in other respects is absurd. We can't imagine—we still can't—Tom Brown (of Culver, Annapolis and West Point) running around with the mob","excerpt":"and the only word for Ed Sullivan's portrayal of Ed Sullivan is \\"unconvincing.\\"The really good thing on the Criterion's bill is a British preparedness film, \\"The Warning,\\" currently being shown throughout the empire to bring home to England's civil population the necessity of adequate civilian defense against modern warfare. The picture contains an astonishingly real air raid on London and its suburbs, with bombs bursting in the streets, poison gas drifting down, flames spreading. And, marshalled in defense, are graphically described not merely the military services, but the various civilian corps—the antigas brigades, volunteer firemen, highway patrols, building monitors, nursing and medical units and many others—which England has been forming.

The card first appeared five years ago and today has more than 200,000 users and counting.

Even though the emotional gamut she runs is as hackneyed as a hod, she makes it so valid and vibrant that yon feel every twitch of it with her.It is that of a healthy, lively farm girl who is tumbled and tossed among three men, each of them typical of his milieu and respectful toward her in his way.First, there's her well-to-do employer, a middle-aged married man whose wife is an invalid and whose feelings toward the milkmaid are hot but honorable. He is the first to despoil her, craftily but with her consent, taking advantage of her fond hope that he may some day marry her.Then there's a steam-shovel driver, a big, handsome brute of a chap, who ravishes the girl in a wheat field when she teases and turns him down. And finally there's a meek and modest printer, a skinny, bespectacled little guy who wants to marry her all through the picture, and presumably does at the end.But this rather cheerless redemption of the poor girl does not occur before she has been forsaken by the two men who have violated her and has borne a child, unassisted, under a railway culvert in the snow. As you can see, a heavy gamut of emotions is generously arranged for Miss Schell.She runs it skillfully, however, never making a false or specious move, even though she does do a lot of smirking and giggling in her gay, Coquettish moods. She is this unfortunate farm girl, as she was the poor wife in \\"Gervaise,\\" and she makes you feel it with her terror and her torment when she stumbles under that culvert to have her child.There is nothing psychological or complex about this old-fashioned role, but it presents a not uncommon personal problem that is fully portrayed by Miss Schell.As the stolid Germanic employer, Leopold Biberti is plausible, too, making a decent man's dilemma degrading and genuinely sad","excerpt":"and the robust Italian, Raf Vallone, makes the steam-shovel driver quite abrute. Hannes Messemer is excellent as the printer who hangs on to the bitter end, and Kathe Gold articulates with sad expressions the sympathy and pathos of the wife.Wolfgang Staudte has directed with a firm grip for a slow, insistent pace that gives the conventional complications an air of immensity. Much of the action takes place outdoors, is therefore open and free and is photographed in excellent color, which helps immeasurably. Ample English subtitles convey the German dialogue.Also on the bill at the Little Carnegie is a short about the painter Vincent van Gogh.

And he has succeeded in keeping at least one wolf — utter boredom — from the door by recruiting the screen's most ascetic-looking actor, Max von Sydow, to impersonate the tortured, aging writer Harry Haller","excerpt":"and the screen's most enigmatic woman, Dominique Sanda, to portray Hermine, Harry's alter ego and cicerone to the unconventional.Mr. Haines has also marshaled an impressive battery of special effects — animation, Daliesque art, television superimpositions and color synthesizers—that divert the eye, while the mind and the emotions remain uncaptivated.Neither the stars nor the special effects can disguise the fact that \\"Steppenwolf\\" is a wordy, talky movie, stubbornly rooted in its printed origins.This might be tolerable if the talk were interesting or if Harry Haller's sufferings managed to evoke sympathy. The truth is that the talk ranges from the silly to the sententious, the philosophy is simpleminded, and Harry emerges as an insufferable case of attenuated adolescense.He probably should have been left forever to the printed page, an actor both in Hesse's \\"Magic Theater for Madmen Only\\" and in the inexhaustible theater of readers' imaginations.

But the shuttle's economics have proved as disastrous as its O-rings. Its expense has turned it into a giant barrier to the vigorous exploitation of space.   To win approval for the shuttle, NASA in 1971 chose a cheap design; cheap to develop, that is, but expensive to operate. The deeper error was to make the shuttle a manned vehicle. When humans go into space, their life-support systems go too, and everything must be man-rated for extra safety. That means more weight, more cost.

''A Harvard Miscellany,'' as its early subtitle indicated, it was mainly financed by Mr. Kirstein's father (who happened, conveniently, to be the president of Filene's department store in Boston) and was launched when Mr. Kirstein and his friend Varian Fry decided to publish their own literary magazine. (They were Harvard undergraduates, and the college's literary magazine, The Advocate, had been unresponsive to their talents.) Hound & Horn was to feature articles about outstanding Harvard alumni - the likes of Henry James, Henry Adams, George Santayana, T.S. Eliot and others. If the end result was less than originally imagined along that line, still, R.P. Blackmur wrote at length about Eliot and Louis Zukofsky about Adams","excerpt":"and the special issue on James was notable.  The Harvard touch was particularly felt in early issues of the magazine.

THEATRICAL ARTISTS LONG ISLAND GUIDE"},{"year":"1991","title":"To the Editor:   The suggestions for revising the calendar put forward by Stewart I. Edelstein (\\"Here's to a Really New Year,\\" Op-Ed, Dec. 31) are timely. There is much to be said for a scheme that substitutes months of equal length, each beginning on the same day of the week, for the crazy-quilt calendar we inherited from Julius Caesar. Both our business lives and personal lives would benefit from a simpler and more regular system of figuring dates. But this particular blueprint -- with its weeks of alternating seven and eight days, with every 15th day a holiday and then five extra holidays thrown in at the end of the year -- adds almost as many complications as it gets rid of.   A simpler solution might be a 13-month calendar with four weeks of seven days each, totaling 364 days, with an extra day at the year's end to bring it to 365 (two extra days in leap year). If this sounds bizarre, it is not a new idea. The Mesopotamian lunar calendar made use of intercalary 13-month years, which remain in the Jewish calendar","excerpt":"and the tradition of a 13-month year survived among European peasants as late as the 14th century, according to Robert Graves.   Meddling with the calendar is indeed a tricky business. The French Revolutionists invented a calendar based on three 10-day weeks, or decades, in each of the 12 months. The days and the months were given new names to break down their religious associations, and five republican holidays named Virtue, Genius, Labor, Reason and Rewards were added at the end of the year. But the scheme proved so confusing and unpopular that it fell out of use long before it was officially abandoned.    In the 1930's the Soviet Union imposed a five-day and, later, a six-day week, with staggered days of rest for the workers to heighten the general disruption. But as with the French scheme it proved unenforceable: the seven-day week had too strong a hold.   Any new arrangement should keep the traditional seven-day week and 12-month year while getting rid of the anomalies that remain from the Julian or Gregorian calendar. Here is a possibility: Let each month consist of four weeks or 28 days, starting regularly on a Sunday. The four extra weeks required to bring the total to 52 would be added, one at the beginning of each season, at the end of March, June, September and December. These four months would then consist of 35 days each, except for December, which would be 36 days long, with an extra Saturday, perhaps to be called New Year's Eve, added at the end to round the year out at 365 days.    This arrangement would provide more time for celebration, reflection, bringing one's correspondence up to date and other activities of the season. In leap year an extra day would be added at the end of June and called Midsummer Eve -- to be celebrated with dancing around bonfires or other appropriate rites.   Under this plan, all holidays would retain their present dates, except for Christmas, which would be celebrated on the last Sunday of December, the 29th. This would in fact keep it in its present position, three days after the winter solstice (Dec. 26 in the new reckoning) and a week before New Year. We should not be fixated on Dec. 25 as the date of Christ's birth, which was not established -- by ecclesiastical fiat -- until late in the fourth  century. Before that, it had been attributed to four other months, from November to May.    With Feb. 22 always coming on Sunday, President's Day could be observed once again on Washington's birthday and still remain the occasion for a long weekend -- like Labor Day, New Year, Christmas and Easter. The Memorial Day weekend would start on Saturday, May 28, while Thanksgiving would be firmly fixed on Thursday, Nov. 23. Valentine's Day would always fall on Saturday, and Halloween would also be an occasion for Saturday night revelry.    Birthdays and anniversaries that come in the last two or three days of the seven shortened months would be relocated in the following week. This disruption would be a small price to pay for the gain of a rational system of dates that stayed predictably in place year after year.   Our Julian calendar is now more than 2,000 years old. We will need a better one to take us into the next millennium.

The other six have struck me as ranging from disappointments to downright duds.The most rewarding of the lot was \\"A Shop on High Street\\" the Czechoslovak film about the inhumanity of anti-Semitism, directed by Jan Kodar and Elmar Klos. This touching and stinging drama has been the surprise of the festival, the one really strong, outstanding picture presented so far.Others worth varying commendation are Jean-Luc Godard's \\"Alphaville,\\" Satyajit Ray's \\"Charulata,\\" Bo Widerberg's \\"Raven's End,\\" Milos Forman's \\"Black Peter,\\" which was shown on Saturday. \\"Shakespeare Wallah\\" and the retrospective showing of Réné\\" Clement's \\"Knave of Hearts.\\"\\"Shakespeare Wallah\\" tells a humorous, wistful story of a brief romance between an English girl, who is the ingénue member of a poor little traveling company of Shakespearean repertory players in India, and a young Indian chap, who is also the lover of a popular Indian movie star. But essentially it is a gently humorous and melancholy lament for the passing of the sort of British culture that prevailed among the resident colonials and upper-class Indians prior to the independence of India.The outlines of this deterioration are traced in the shabby and sad experiences of the little troupe when they hit the hill town of Simla, a cool resort where the old \\"Kipling crowd\\" used to spend their long, hot summers. It is here, among the lush trees and soft mists, that the romance between the little actress and the Indian comes to flower","excerpt":"and the usurpation of modern Indian culture, represented by the movie star, is achieved.Mr. Ivory has directed a good cast — which includes Felicity Kendall as the girl, Shashi Kapoor as the fellow and Madhur Jaffrey as the movie star—through delightfully simple complications, and he has captured the realities and moods of a benign aspect of modern India with his expert documentary camera. The film is too long and some of the transitions are rough, but it should do well commercially in this country. It has not yet been booked for release.\\"Black Peter,\\" the other weekend offering that merits a positive score, is a tender comedy about teenagers in Czechoslovakia. It clearly and amusingly reveals that teenagers are the same the world over—and they have the same problems with parents, too.The other weekend offerings were less appealing. \\"Thomas the Imposter,\\" shown Saturday, is a blandly sardonic and tedious French drama about the unreality of a Parisian society woman and charity leader during World War I. It is well played by Emmanuele Riva and well directed by Georges Franju, but it has no more body or bite than a polished period piece.Two Polish films made by Jerzy Skolimowski, who also plays the leading roles in them—\\"Identification Marks: None\\" and \\"Walkover\\"—put on at the shows yesterday afternoon and early evening, turned out to be distractingly random and incoherent studies of a youth before his induction into the army and then 10 years later, when he is trying to land a job.The retrospective showing of Erich von Stroheim's 1925 \\"The Wedding March,\\" presented Saturday afternoon, was also disappointing. It is the sort of thing that should go no farther than the auditorium of the Museum of Modern Art.

Some of the dramatic incidents call to mind thoughts of Vienna in merry and reckless prewar days, of Grimaldi, the famous clown of past years, and also Edgar Allan Poe's story, \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue.\\" Running through the film is a charming love story, and, although the production is 10,000 feet long, the action is so swift and the interest so well sustained, that it hardly seems half that length.After seeing the first reel one is struck with the care taken to make this production seem as if it had been produced in Austria's capital. Mr. Julian is a wonder at accuracy in detail, and the atmosphere of the picture is most alluring. The officers' uniforms are just right, even to the minutest detail, as are also those worn by the soldiers. There are policemen with long swords, tiny numerals on houses, awnings bearing the name of the café","excerpt":"and the very players look as if they belong to the locale. They were selected, except for a few of them, because of their physiognomies and the shapes of their heads.A good deal of the film takes place in the Prater Amusement Park, in which there are merry-go-rounds, small menageries and various other entertainments. The sets are wonderfully realistic, from those in a palace to others in a poor home. When Mr. Julian called for rain he was not satisfied with having water sprayed in one spot before an open door. He obtained a deluge falling in a street and square. In one sequence one is taken with pleasing suddenness from a poorly furnished room to scenes of a palace banquet.There are a number of incidents in this production that will linger in one's mind for some time, especially where an old clown has been badly injured by a large plant pot pushed from a balcony by the villain, who owns a rival show. A second before the clown is making the children laugh at his antics, and while lying on the ground he courageously continues to amuse the little ones, until expression fades from his face and he is carried off unconscious in an ambulance.Cesare Cravina, who plays Sylvester Urban, the clown, also works the puppets in a Punch and Judy show, and he is extremely effective when he weeps for his lost wife as he makes the puppets act for the merriment of the throng outside.There is a great orang-outang—too big, but made to appear very real—whose cage-door is intentionally left open by the hunchback in charge. The beast climbs up a door post to the villain's sleeping quarters and—well. George Siegmann's part as Schani Huber comes to an abrupt end, but what happens is left to the imagination after the animal is seen in Huber's room.The picture opens with Count von Hohenegg (Norman Kerry) being timidly awakened by his nervous servants. He is a young officer who is a favorite of the Emperor Francis Joseph. The Count is listless in the morning and takes his breakfast in his tub. He is engaged to marry the daughter of the Minister of War, when he meets Agnes Urban, daughter of the clown and an organ-grinder in Huber's merry-go-round. The Count is fascinated by the comely girl and tells her that he is a necktie salesman. Kerry is well suited to this part, and to help his make-up he has a regular Austrian military haircut and trains his mustache every morning with a band attached to his ears.Anton Vaverka's make-up and characterization of the Emperor is most interesting. His whiskers appear to belong to him and he wears his uniform with nonchalance and carelessness characteristic of an old man and a contrast to the smart young officers.Siegmann, as usual, makes a grim, convincing villain, always ready with a sneer and brutal rage. Miss Philbin is appealing as the simple girl in love with the gay young officer. Cravina gives a splendid portrayal of the clown. In fact, all the players deserve praise. They seem to have been carried away by the picture as much as those who will go to see it. \\"Merry Go Round\\" is so entertaining that the sets and scenes are almost taken for granted as the story runs along, and Mr. Julian has seen to it that there is movement even in a close-up, on the side of which one observes the stir in the street. There are also some excellent war scenes with masses of helmeted warriors.Instinctively one suspects a picture with the word \\"daughters\\" in the main title, but there may come a time when one encounters an agreeable surprise. However, \\"Wandering Daughters\\" is just about what is to be expected from the title, and James Young is fortunate in having this production screened in the Strand this week, even if it turns out to be unusually warm. The subtitles are of the variety calculated to make one fret and fidget, and it is with intense relief when the other features on the program awaken one from a lethargic state.This production has a country club and, of course, a fast set. Frequent allusions are made to this swift throng, who have their large swimming tank in which the girls disport themselves in bathing suits and the villain takes a plunge through a push from the hero. To some directors there is always drama when the scheming player appears in a soaked dinner suit.There have been pictured plenty of ruthless villains, but it is to be hoped that there never will be another who attempts to revenge himself on a girl by stealing her clothes while she is in a swimming pool. As might be gathered, this particular schemer performed this subtle feat to make tongues babble about the heroine. The moral of the story is evidently to the effect that if parents give their daughter her head she will have sufficient common sense to find out for herself, but that if she is pinioned by restrictions she goes astray.There are two daughters in widely different households. Bessie Bowden (Marguerite de la Motte) has a father who has a small bank account but large understanding. Geraldine Horton has a wealthy father who never could understand. He does not want to let his daughter out of his sight. Having plenty of money he consequently has plenty of liveried servants.Mr. Bowden, observing that his daughter suddenly patronizes the dizzy set, talks the matter over with his wife, and they decide that Bessie belongs to the present-day type of girl and must be humored. So they buy new furniture, have the house decorated, spending all their savings to make the place presentable for Bessie's callers. So intense is Mr. Bowden's sympathy for his daughter that he even takes to smoking from a long cigarette holder, having noticed that his daughter enjoys her cigarettes in that way.Old man Horton (Noah Beery) looks as if he were suddenly bereft of his senses when he learns that his daughter has been to the country club. Mr. Beery indulges in a lot of manual acting, so much so that it looks as if he were going to settle matters by throttling Geraldine. So Horton's daughter disappoints him, and therefore he does not enjoy his wealth.Mr. Bowden, on the other hand, is left with no money, but happy because his daughter in the end marries her old sweetheart.\\"Here is an instance of one of the classical subtitles: \\"Don't drag Bessie's name in the dust or I will have something to say to you!\\"There are several other combinations of words equally satisfactory and subtle. One of the sequences is an automobile exceeding the speed limit being overhauled by an enterprising motorcycle policeman, who slips from his cycle to the running-board of the car, driven, naturally, by the villain.There is nothing inspiring about this photoplay, but the players have done as well as they could in their respective rôles.At the Capitol is \\"The Chase,\\" a story of the Alps??? \\"Ivan the Great,\\" with a big brown bear, and \\"The Cuckoo's Secret.\\"At the Rialto, \\"Peter the Great,\\" with Emil Jannings and others.

Brown comedy at the Globe. Not since Chaplin have we behold so unbrokenly successful a pattern of pure cinematic clownery, or one that tickled us so hugely, as the David Loew-Edward Sedgwick productional and directoral triumph, \\"The Gladiator,\\" in which Joe (whose face is an oral surgeon's nightmare) is converted by a marvelous serum into the world's strongest man.It starts with Joe telling bedtime stories in his best rubbery-faced vein to a hospital ward full of little crippled boys","excerpt":"and the way it goes on from there, developing cumulative and explosively comical horsepower as it goes, you would think Mack Sennett was back on the set with a megaphone, being Father Goose again. Right off, Joe is fired, by a hard-hearted committee that wants to replace him with a college graduate. The next thing you know, he is rushing, dazed but honest, into a movie to return a lost handbag, is forced to buy a ticket and that ticket wins the big Bank Night pot of $1,500. The incident itself is funny and not impossible, especially in Mack Sennett-land, but the way it happens is funnier.With all that money Joe sets out for Webster College and the education he missed when family circumstances forced him to leave while still a freshman in 1926. He shows up in the kind of pants they were wearing that year, and tries to take life up where he left off. Meanwhile, the aged and mildly lunatic professor Joe boards with is brewing a batch of superman serum (extract of ants for strength, of grasshoppers for agility, seems to be the formula). Injecting it into a small monkey, he is delighted when the monkey beats its chest and roars like a gorilla. When Joe is brought home that night, physically shattered after an unmerciful drubbing by the football squad, the sight of his peacefully sleeping face gives the professor an inspiration.What happens to Joe and the household furniture next morning when he wakes up is funny as only the most obvious buffoonery can be. At practice next day he leaves a wake of mutilated tackles, and when the athletic director meekly invites him to throw the javelin. Joe inquires: \\"What's the matter, don't you want it no more?\\" before hurling it into the next county. Joe is getting on fine with everybody, even with June Travis, who started leading him on just for the good of the team, when unexpectedly, in the middle of a wrestling bout with Man Mountain Dean (Joe has to have the $10,000 purse so he can adopt one of his crippled orphans) the serum wears off.

Of Scottsdale, Arizona, and Quechee, Vermont (formerly Hingham, MA), President and Chairman of the Zildjian Company in Norwell, MA, died Thursday at his home in Scottsdale. He was 81. Born in Quincy, he attended local schools, including Thayer Academy and Colgate University until called to serve in the Philippines in 1942. Upon his return, he entered the family business, the world's largest cymbal manufacturer and the oldest company in America. An amateur musician himself, Zildjian said he felt privileged to have been born into a musical dynasty, which dates back to 1623. Appointed President two years before his father's death, Armand took over the role of family patriarch in 1977. Zildjian was known for his charismatic personality and warm personal relationship with drummers. He had selected cymbals for such drummers as Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, Max Roach, Jo Jones and many others and matched cymbals for the Boston Symphony and leading orchestras around the world. The foremost authority in cymbal sound, he created new product innovations in response to the ever-changing needs of musicians and remained deeply involved in the operation of the company until his death. Zildjian received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music, was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame, and Guitar Center's Rock Walk in Hollywood, and most recently received Moder Drummer Magazine Editors Achievement Award.

This is a biography of a man as well as a sports figure and its appeal is not limited to sports fans.

''The resulting disappointment was as slow and subtle in coming as the realization that, yes, once again he'd somehow gotten his hopes up. His grip on reality had always been a point of pride with him, and he felt a little like a backsliding AA member for losing that grip. Hope was a luxury he could not afford - a cruelty, really.''

English Public Schools 1800-1864. By John Chandos. 412 pages. $29.95.  WRITING of his own years at Eton in ''Enemies of Promise,'' Cyril Connolly spoke of ''The Theory of Permanent Adolescence'' - that is, the theory ''that the experiences undergone by boys at the great public schools, their glories and disappointments, are so intense as to dominate their lives and to arrest their development.'' He wrote of how he dreaded leaving school, how brilliant friends faded into sadness and obscurity after leaving Eton, how ''the greater part of the ruling class'' of England had been permanently scarred by what happened to them as schoolboys.   Certainly the public school experience dominates the memoirs and letters of British writers and statesmen to a degree that Americans find difficult to comprehend. For us, high school or prep school is little more than a place to pass our awkward years. If we feel nostalgia for our schooldays at all, it is mainly a nostalgia for our own innocence, now lost and faraway, not for the school experience itself. For many Englishmen - or at least Englishmen of a certain generation and class - it is another matter indeed.

But while America's elite law schools salute Holmes as a giant of the bar, they have been reluctant to apply his dictum to the study of law itself.   Most of the nation's leading legal educators have defined their mission as training students to ''think like lawyers''","excerpt":"and their methodology, first developed by Harvard Law School Professor Christopher Columbus Langdell in the 1870's, is the exacting analysis of appellate court opinions.   Instruction in the ''practical'' side of the law - learning state statutes, drafting complaints, counseling clients, negotiating settlements - was eagerly relinquished to bar review courses and to the offices in which lawyers began their careers.   Despite periodic assaults over the years, Langdell's approach to legal education remains relatively intact at most major law schools.  Some, however, like New York University, Northeastern, Georgetown and Northwestern have active, variegated ''clinical'' programs, in which students spent up to half their study time representing clients, either real or simulated, under the supervision of faculty members or practicing attorneys.

A loving, dedicated father who was generous to those in need, a champion of human rights who established the Jarkow Institute for Latin American Studies with the Anti-Defamation League, a business mogul in the children's wear industry, an avid hunter, died of natural causes, peacefully, in his home in Boca Raton, on March 9. He was 90 years old. Mr. Jarkow's passion was for the well-being and love of his family, his wife of 68 years, Edna, and their children, Joan, Kenneth, and Jerilynne, and son-in-law Michael Fierstein. Pappy, as he was called by his six grandchildren and their spouses, Jon and Kerri Halpern, Julie and James Cook, Jason and Katelyn Halpern, Candace Sands, Adam and Adriana Jarkow, and David Fierstein","excerpt":"and their nine great-grandchildren, Kelsey and Joel Halpern, Eliana and Jacob Sands, Leah McClean Jackson and Kelsie Cook and Max Halpern. He is also survived by his sister Adele. Always the salesman, Mr. Jarkow began at age 13, selling balloons on the streets in Coney Island, NY. As an adult, he began selling children's clothing for A.S. Lazarus & Co., developing a rapport with small children's retailers as well as large department stores across the country. In 1943, he established his own firm, Sydney Infants Wear in New York City, which manufactured and jobbed children's wear and children's toys and products. Kent, Inc., and Pixie Playmates rounded out his business endeavors. For more than 50 years, Mr. Jarkow was an industry leader in both sales and charitable endeavors. His son Kenneth worked by his side until the business was sold to Gerber Products at the end of the 20th century. Throughout his life, Sydney--also known as Chick by his close friends-was a philanthropist. Whether it was his generosity with his family and extended family or human rights issues close to his heart or a stranger who serendipitously entered his life, Sydney opened his heart, gave a personal helping hand, and reached for his wallet. ''If I can help, I should help. I worked hard and reaped the financial benefits, so why shouldn't I share that with those who are in need?'' Sydney often said, and there were many who benefited. Mr. Jarkow's international contributions for human rights manifested itself through the Anti-Defamation League. In 1986, he established the Jarkow Institute for Latin America. The Institute enables the ADL to expand human rights programs throughout Latin America. He remained chairman until his death, and he began the institute with Rabbi Martin M. Rosenthal, Executive Director. The Jarkow family is celebrating his life and accomplishments at a private family service in Boca Raton, FL. There is so much to be proud of, so much to be thankful for, so much to smile and laugh about. We all had a great ride with him.

Testifying before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh tried to disqualify commonwealth status as a legitimate alternative, stating that \\"an area within the sovereignty of the United States that is not included in a state must necessarily be governed by or under the authority of Congress.\\" He cited the territorial clause of the Constitution, to imply that Puerto Rico is nothing but a colony of the United States. As became evident in an exchange with Senator Bennett Johnston, this statement runs afoul of longstanding Federal court precedents.    It also contradicts the United Nations understanding of the commonwealth relationship, particularly General Assembly Resolution 748 (VIII) of 1953, which found commonwealth to be a new noncolonial self-governing political status for Puerto Rico. As United States representative at the United Nations in 1971, Mr. Bush himself told the General Assembly that in establishing the commonwealth relationship, the Puerto Rican people \\"freely entered into a compact with the United States and freely adopted their own constitution.\\"   Mr. Thornburgh's statement is just the latest of a series of crass breaches of neutrality and objectivity for partisan reasons by the Bush Administration. Last May, Andrew Card and Chase Untermeyer, two White House officials, flew to Puerto Rico to attend pro-statehood rallies and Republican fund raisers, giving repeated statements to the local press on the benefits of statehood and the allegedly unstable and undemocratic nature of commonwealth status. Every Bush Administration witness before a Congressional committee on referendum bills has tried to impugn commonwealth status and promote statehood, disregarding a longstanding Federal policy of respect for Puerto Rico's self-determination.   Commonwealth status remains the commonsensical political expression of the two essential aspirations of the Puerto Rican people: their allegiance to the United States and their United States citizenship","excerpt":"and their will to maintain their sense of identity as a people in their own right, with a distinct heritage, culture and the Spanish language.

Congress has worked with Puerto Rico's political leadership for two years to define mutually acceptable terms and transitions for each status alternative. However, self-determination means that the ultimate choice lies with the people of Puerto Rico.

And it is this long and colorful history that this picture sketches interestingly.From the ancient seat of Jewish culture in the town of Kazimierz on the Vistula —a beautiful locality in which not a Jew was left after World War II—it traces the spread of Jewish influence in trade and science through the centuries and the settlement of two-thirds of the Jewish population in the smaller communities (or \\"shtetl\\") in the 19th century.There are vivid scenes of life in the shtetl, which were the locales of much of the Jewish art and literature with which Americans are acquainted","excerpt":"and there are good prewar motion pictures of teeming Jewish life in such cities as Vilna, Cracow and Warsaw.The crux of the picture, however—\\"the last chapter\\" —is the last half-hour, which is made up of awesome news footage and clips from Polish fiction films (Andrzej Wajda's \\"Kanal\\" and others) showing the concentration of the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto, the brave efforts that were made to carry on and the culminating defiance of the ghetto uprising and the consequent massacre in 1943.Much of the eloquence of this picture is in the scholarlly and often poetic narration written by S. L. Schneiderman and spoken by Theodore Bikel. and in the splendid musical score of Vladimir Heifetz. which is filled with folk and traditional Jewish themes and flows generously through the picture.

As a satire, set to a rock 'n' roll beat, of teen-age, high school tribal customs in the sun-kissed (or is it crazed?) state, its lines of dialogue and those of its lovelies are far more memorable than its humor.Why the picture is called \\"Lord Love a Duck\\" is anyone's guess. The closest this observer can come is to blame it on Roddy McDowall, who croaks and quacks. He is a bright but addled senior at Los Angeles' new Consolidated High School, who takes delight in minding other people's business, especially romantic business concerning blonde, pretty Tuesday Weld.In the course of his Machiavellian assists he sees to it that her dad, estranged from her mother, played by Lola Albright, buys his daughter 13 fancy sweaters. He also arranges that she becomes the most popular of her bikini-clad, sexy classmates at a beach party, and meets and marries rich Martin West.He also aids in getting her a secretary's assignment with the prissy principal and, finally, disposes of her mate and lands her the leading role in the ultimate beach picture, \\"Bikini Widow,\\" her young life's dream. Fate and the boys in the white jackets do catch up with our now berserk hero, but it is all too obvious. Even in Southern California, a \\"Bikini Widow\\" or a drive-in church are likely to crack one up.The ribbing is pointed in the drive-in church segment and the jazzy, romantic counseling given the teen-agers by the ultra-hip minister. It is also delightful in scenes with Martin Gabel, as the \\"Bikini\\" producer, dreaming dreams of greater triumphs. And in those with Ruth Gordon, as the rich, wacky mother of the bridegroom, who calls her psychi-atrist-husband's death \\"purely psychosomatic.\\"In \\"Lord Love a Duck,\\" the fast-moving lampoons are obvious. The lines are funny and biting, but they rarely generate big laughs.THE LAST CHAPTER, a pictorial chronicle of the Jewish community in Poland, written by S. L.

His work was informed by qualities that are prized in period-instrument groups. The orchestra playing was lithe, articulate  and rhythmically incisive.

Faced with the bustle that often accompanies holiday get-togethers, savvy hosts who know how to survive also know how to keep it simple, that is, except for desserts, which at their most lavish can make the most ordinary occasion seem opulent. Pressed for time, many hosts let others sift the flour, shave the chocolate and candy the fruit.

But for dessert, an item that hosts won't find everywhere is baked Alaska, the festive meringue-wrapped brick of strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice cream all ready to be slipped into the home oven. $10 and $18. At $8.40 a dozen, a tray full of miniature fruit tarts or chocolate-wrapped mousse tarts or both makes a brilliant display","excerpt":"and these little mouthfuls are wonderfully light and luscious as well.

Upward of four thousand people forced their way into the Martin Gropius Building, where the show can be seen through Jan. 16, 1983. They included artists, collectors, curators, dealers and critics both from the United States and from all over Europe.

But that has been of necessity, for his chosen instrument, the guitar, has been something of a handicap. For Mr. Segovia, the guitar was a stately vessel through which a composer's inspiration could flow directly to the heart. But to much of the musical world he hoped to conquer, it was a crude, folk instrument. Mr. Segovia has fought his battle on many fronts. At 93, he continues to give concerts - in fact, he is performing at Avery Fisher Hall on Wednesday. Behind him lies a string of works he commissioned, an extensive series of performing editions, and a catalogue of modern refinements he has brought to modern guitar technique.   But perhaps the most lasting and significant of Mr. Segovia's contributions are his recordings, a discography of some 30 LP's, recorded over half a century (his first sessions took place on May 2, 1927, his most recent on June 24, 1977), and embodying a healthy slice of the guitar's contemporary history. Like his concert performances, Mr. Segovia's recordings display the guitar's capabilities in a way that astounds many whose expectations of the instrument are less lofty","excerpt":"and they have undoubtedly won many converts to the guitarist's cause.

Stokowski was destined to become what might be called a prophet of the phonograph by an unusual quirk in his perception of music.

He recorded a number of them, and released them on LP. One, a show from March 1968 at the State University at Buffalo, billed as ''Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band: Purple Modal Fire Strobe Ecstasy,'' became fairly well-known over time but dropped out of print. A new label, Elision Fields, has made it available again, the first of a projected series of discs from Mr. Riley's archives. (The CD's title is ''Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band: All Night Flight.'') Mr. Riley's stamina was amazing. He improvised on saxophone and organ over cumulative tape loops, via one reel of tape and two tape recorders, one set for recording and one set for playback. The sound grows more massed, the pulses and drones bigger, more insistent and polyphonic","excerpt":"and though it is one unbroken piece of music, the CD track markers are set at opportune shifts of action. Here is a musician totally in charge of his material. Though he wasn't a virtuosic saxophonist, Mr. Riley manipulated the horn cleanly within the parameters of his idea. The music is beautifully executed and, amazingly, never spreads itself too thin.    International Harvester       Plenty of rock bands answered the siren of Mr. Riley's pulsating minimalism in one way or another, including the Velvet Underground, the Who and Suicide. So did International Harvester, a Swedish band of the late '60s that made the record ''Sov Gott Rose-Marie.'' The album was reissued a few years ago on the Swedish label Silence and has now been made domestically available via the distributor Forced Exposure. When Mr. Riley performed ''In C'' in Stockholm in 1967, one of the musicians in the ensemble was Bo Anders Persson, who would become the guitarist and vocalist in International Harvester. ''Sov Gott Rose-Marie'' and its sequel, ''Hemat'' -- recorded a year later when the band was called simply Harvester and also now available from Forced Exposure -- are far from great records.

There were two composers and great contrasts. First Beethoven: the Fourth Symphony evoking a radiant enthusiasm from the orchestra under Mr. Nygaard, and then a strangely iconoclastic performance of the Violin Concerto.

The other piece of the evening - John Adams's ''Harmonium'' - was written in 1981, but it too aspired to a breadth of sound and expressivity that was also Romantic in its way.   ''Harmonium'' is a chorus and orchestra piece of large dimensions set to one poem by John Donne and two more by Emily Dickinson. It shares a generosity of feeling with both Elgar and Brahms but expresses it very differently. While the latter, in other words, harmonically move and transform themselves and draw us along in their wake, Mr. Adams's piece tends to occupy a fixed space in musical space and time. Its changes are from within - accumulations and diminutions that can be expressed in volume, in intensities of orchestral and choral color and in the varying inner animation of movement within this given space. Thus Donne's ''Negative Love'' began with lazy murmuring syllables and proceeded to widen and contract in a series of long, gradual breaths.

Of Blue Hill, ME, a retired advertising agency executive, former weekly newspaper publisher and avid fisherman-not necessarily in that order-died Saturday, July 21, at the Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor of complications from a stroke. He was stricken a month earlier while on a fishing trip to Canada. Jim was born in New York City on May 15, 1922, the son of John and Marie McCaffrey of Scarsdale, N.Y. He was educated at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., & was enrolled at Princeton University when he as stricken with polio at the age of 19. Despite surviving with only limited mobility in his left leg and none at all in his right, McCaffrey nevertheless completed his education at Princeton, graduating with honors in 1944, and was headed for law school at Harvard University when he took a summer job in the mailroom of Young and Rubicam, then the second largest advertising agency in the world. He was bitten by the advertising bug and told Harvard ''the law will have to do without me.'' In 1945, Jim met a young woman named Virginia (''Geegee'') Given on the beach of Fire Island and the two were marrid the following year. While she continued working as an editor for ''Glamour Magazine'' and ''House Garden Magazine'', he quickly worked his way up the advertising ladder to become an account executive, first at Young and Rubicam and then at Ogilvy and Mather. In 1962, he joined forces with David B. McCall to purchase an agency called C.J. LaRoche and Co. Thus was born the firm of McCaffrey and McCall, Inc. The company became one of New York's preeminent advertising agencies over the next two decades. Over his career, Jim worked with such clients as Rolls Royce, J.C. Penney, Bacardi Rum, Helena Rubenstein, Pepperidge Farm, Hathaway Shirt, Norelco and ABC Television. Jim served as the agency's chairman of the board for the next 10 years, also ascending to the presidency of the 4A's (American Association of Advertising Agencies). He retired in 1973 at the age of 50 to move with Geegee to a Castine, ME farm overlooking the Bagaduce River. Once in Castine, Jim quickly became involved in the community. He was an active member of Our Lady of Holy Hope Catholic Church and a founder of the volunteer Bagaduce Ambulance Corps, which continues to serve Castine and surrounding towns today. Jim also played a major role in Castine's ''revolt'' against a state uniform property tax, helping lead a successful statewide effort to repeal the unpopular tax. In 1976, he made an aggressive bid to represent Hancock County in the Main Senate. Opting to run as an independent, without party affiliation or support, Jim nevertheless garnered more than 4,000 votes in a four-way race that was won by the Republican incumbent. In 1980, he embarked on a career as a newspaper publisher, teaming with editor Hugh Bowden to launch the weekly Castine Patriot, serving the towns of Castine, Orland, Penobscot and Brooksville. Jim's strong and thoughtful viewpoints appeared each week in well-crafted editorials, each carefully written in longhand, that became the talk of the community. Though the newspaper has seen several owners since Jim sold it in 1982, it continues to flourish today. Jim had a keen mind and fiery temper and did not suffer fools gladly. But he was also sensitive, articulate and could be loyal almost to a fault. Partner David McCall said of him on his retirement, ''Jim has never hurt a fellow human being in his life. Jim not only treats everyone equally, he literally can't see any difference between the president of General Motors and the window washer-unless one of them is an ass.'' The McCaffrey's sold their Castine farm in 1997 and became residents of Parker Ridge, a retirement community in Blue Hill, ME. For more than 50 years, Jim was an avid fisherman in Maine, Canada and the Bahamas. His fishing partner and 55-year partner in life was always his wife. Regarding his stroke and ultimate death, Geegee commented to friends about their most recent trip to Canada: ''Jim caught a 10pound salmon before he had other things to do.'' And no one knows his no-holds-barred dedication to tomorrow better than she. In addition to his wife, Jim is survived by a daughter, Anne (''Nancy'') McCaffrey Rathmell of Belfast","excerpt":"and three granddaughters, Meghan Rathmell of Hollis, Erin Rathmell of West Tisbury, Mass., and Katharine Rathmell of Exeter, N.H.

Darwin modestly asserted that he had ''two distinct objects in view: firstly to show that species had not been separately created, and secondly, that natural selection had been the chief agent of change.''\\n\\nThe first implied the fact of evolution. In ''The Origin of Species,'' Darwin did not use the term itself - he spoke of ''transmutation'' and of ''modification by descent'' - but at the end of his presentation of evidence he concluded that ''from so simple a beginning endless forms... have been, and are being evolved.'' The second assertion described the mechanism behind evolution. Here Darwin's genius truly manifested itself.

On first impression, the show seems quiet and plain, even a little drab, but with time it reveals itself as an occasion of rather stunning beauty. This is not too surprising. Mr. Polke, one of the most important artists of the postwar period, is known for works that at first appear inconsequential -- thin, chaotic and somewhat unfinished -- that seem to subvert and ridicule the very notion of making a painting, much less a masterpiece.   Adding to the initial ugly-duckling effect of many of the paintings is a general air of inconsistency and contradiction. Mr. Polke, whose achievement comes out of 60's Pop Art and sets the stage for 80's Neo-Expressionism, is an incorrigible quick-change artist","excerpt":"and thus the unfinished look that can momentarily unsettle his individual efforts is intensified throughout by a bewildering array of styles, techniques and materials.

Yet he wrote many volumes of poetry, criticism, biography, theology and plays that influenced some important writers, among them T.S. Eliot, W.H. Auden, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.   His novels are the easiest of his books to read, but even in them there are traps for the unwary. I am partial to ''The Place of the Lion,'' in which Platonic ideas keep bursting through the illusion of reality, and one finds the Lion of Strength and the Eagle of Wisdom and many such characters erupting into suburban London","excerpt":"and to ''All Hallow's Eve,'' in which two women killed in a bombing raid find themselves in a London of the dead that coexists with the London of the living, both within an eternal London. And ''Descent into Hell,'' which Eliot published for Williams in 1937, may be the most perfect spiritual thriller in English. The plot is about people performing a play but also about heaven and hell, and the characters in the novel pass in and out of history, eternity and different planes of existence without much warning to the reader, since the different planes exist simultaneously on the London hill where the action occurs. An inattentive reader can get lost quickly.

Mr. Reagan missed that opportunity by failing to nail down the Soviet offer to reduce by 50 percent the strategic offensive weapons of both sides - land-based, submarine-based and air-based.   Intead of thus closing the so-called ''window of vulnerability,'' against which he himself had so frequently warned, Mr. Reagan opted to protect a research program in which some of the most distinguished American scientists have no faith, and for which the necessary computers and software do not and may never exist.
