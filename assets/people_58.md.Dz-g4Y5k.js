Those exercised by the latter question should not expect an answer from the Brooklyn Museum's 24th National Print Exhibition - the work of Barry Walker, who is associate curator in its prints and drawings department. But in addition to a snappy selection of a hundred wholly or partly printed images, they will find the problem admirably defined and accounted for in Mr. Walker's catalogue essay.   This opens with the statement that when the exhibition series began, nearly 40 years ago, ''everyone knew what a print was.'' It was a small, usually black and white image that didn't cost much. Once the principal means of acquainting the public with art sequestered in private houses or situated in far-off places, such images had become works to be cherished for themselves and, aimed at connoisseurs, they were for the most part produced by specialists.

The result is a good entertainment for children, who not only have the opportunity of following a melodra matic story but also of seeing crack riders from the Far West in action in a circus arena.It is an ingenuous little tale in which the King is a little boy and it is probably the first film in which a monarch has been shown in his shirt sleeves. This happens when Charles V of Alvonia steals away from a council meeting during the inevitable discussion of taxation and joins the throng lining the sidewalk to look at a circus parade.Charles is thrown ignominiously into the roadway by an urchin and he is rescued by Tom Reed (Mr. Mix), who lifts the youngster onto his horse. It is an exciting time for Charles. He is recognized by the crowd, who wave handkerchiefs and take off their hats, while the police stand at attention. This surprises both Tom and his chief assistant, Red, who have not had such a remarkable reception anywhere. Soon, however, the King informs Tom that he is the ruler of Alvonia.Charles pleads to go to see the Tom Reed show, and reluctantly permission is granted. He and others ride in a stage coach and there is a thrill for them when the horses are frightened. But Tom Reed gallops up to the vehicle, leaps off Tony's back, climbs into the driving seat and soon the horses are under control.The sinister Count DeMar, Prime Minister, is eager to have a certain tax bill passed and Charles dodges signing it. DeMar therefore decides that, king or no king, Charles shall be put into a dungeon with his loyal tutor, Professor Lorenz. The latter is told to end his own life and also Charles's with a couple of bullets","excerpt":"but the tutor refuses. DeMar then turns on water to drown the king and the professor, but one rather thinks that Tom Reed will reach the castle in time to save his little pal. And he does.In the latter stages of this film Mr. Mix gives exhibitions of agility and also of a humorous fashion of disposing of DeMar's sentries. There are moments, when the military is ramming the door, that one expects it to burst open long before the film director wants it to. Mr. Mix also affords some amusement by teaching Charles slang, and these episodes and others recall Will Rogers's picture, \\"Ambassador Bill.\\"Little Mickey Rooney appears as Charles and he does quite well. James Kirkwood, the veteran film player, impersonates the rascally DeMar. Wallis Clark is pleasing as Professor Lorenz and Noel Francis is cast as a pretty relative of the King of Alvonia.

Mr. Talbot has brought us a number of valuable films (mostly foreign) that we might otherwise never have seen. A case could be made that the recurring New Yorker festival has, so far, been at least as rewarding as the annual hyper-compressed New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center.This is by way of prelude to the opinion that Mr. Talbot's latest presentation is one of the worst he has imported and one of the worst foreign films I can remember. It is \\"Lotna,\\" which means \\"swift,\\" and was made in 1959 by Andrzej Wajda, the Polish director best known for his trilogy \\"A Generation,\\" \\"Kanal\\" and \\"Ashes and Diamonds.\\" (His latest film is called simply \\"Ashes,\\" an epic of the Napoleonic wars, recently shown at the Cannes Festival.)In my view, Wadja's trilogy—which is concerned with Poland during and immediately after the Second World War—is patently imitative of Russian and French models, self-consciously dramatic and basically spurious. But it does have a certain arty gloss. The one interesting point about \\"Lotna\\" is a negative one: it was made after the trilogy, yet it is much cruder in technique and structure.The title is the name of a horse—a dappled gray mare that is acquired by a Polish cavalry company retreating before the Germans in 1939. The mare symbolizes the chivalric spirit of old Poland doomed by the mechanized Germans and the new age. That symbol might have been effective in a film","excerpt":"but the use of it here is so choppy and silly that this picture seems considerably longer than its 88 minutes.Matters start tackily enough when the mare makes her way through a huge mansion to her dying master's bedside, where the soldiers find her. She soon passes into the hands of a young officer who, through a coincidence that would shame a decadent capitalist filmmaker, encounters a girl he once knew. Precipitously, the young couple marry, and on the wedding night, the young man steals away for a look at the mare. Later, the pair are forced to spend that wedding night in the stable.It is the most blatant case of equine alienation of affections since Robinson Jeffers's \\"Roan Stallion.\\"One of the lamentably recognizable Wajda touches is the device of having the wedding service coincide with the burial service of an officer killed in battle. As the bride leaves the church, her veil catches on the coffin. This is ironic and meaningful — for those whose demands in irony and meaning are slight.Mixed in with this horsy glue are some shots of slaughter, but they do not make realism out of what is essentially an inferior romance for children, photographed — except for some sepia stretches—in dreadful color.Wajda is one of the leaders of the postwar Polish film renascence that produced, among others, Roman Polanski, the director of \\"Knife in the Water\\" and \\"Repulsion.\\" (I think I glimpsed Polanski, who has been an actor, as a shiny-helmeted bandsman at the wedding.) As a pioneer in this movement, Wajda has some importance — hence, I suppose, Mr. Talbot's interest. Those who share this historical interest may feel that they have to see \\"Lotna.\\" Screen: 'Lotna' and 'Tsar to Lenin' Have Premieres:The Russian Revolution Recorded on Film"},{"year":"1947","title":"Rept on bldg permits, Chicago, May, Bell Savings and Loan Assn CHICAGO PERMITS RISE","excerpt":"But the Usual Seasonal Gain in Building Is Lacking"},{"year":"1921","title":"PITTSBURGH, April 30.--There does not seem to be any variation in the quietness of the pig iron market.

The hopes were based on the notion that the Government of President Amin Gemayel could gradually extend its authority beyond the tiny area of Beirut, helped by the presence of more than 5,000 foreign troops in restraining violent factions. But the eruption of war last week between Christian and Druse militias in the Shuf Mountains east of the capital was a brutal indication that the hopes were fragile.   Even amidst the first full-scale war since the Israeli invasion, despair had not overwhelmed this resilient capital, however. The 34,000-man national army, trained and equipped by the United States, maintained a defense line east and south of Beirut.

This last volume starts in 1960 in Cambridge, Mass., where Wilson was teaching, conveniently close to his Cape Cod house in Wellfleet, Mass., and ends in upstate New York, at Talcottville, in June 1972. In it, we see his slow decline. Here are excerpts.\\nCambridge, Spring 1960\\n\\nI HAVE sometimes lately had the impression that my appearance and personality have almost entirely disappeared, and that there is little but my books marching through me: the Indian book, the Civil War. They live, I am ceasing to live. But this is partly due to too much drinking, reading and thinking at night, then plunging into work at the library. \\n[\\nA friend\\n]\\n lays off drink twice a year for ten days or two weeks. He thus loses, he says, about seven pounds and reduces that bloated look. Inspired by this noble example, I have adopted the same course -- beginning on my 65th birthday -- and feel much the better for it. My contacts with life have become more normal, and I find that I will have to make a new hole in my belt.\\nTalcottville, Summer 1961\\n\\n As a character in one of Chekhov's plays says he's \\"a man of the 80's,\\" so I find that I am a man of the 20's. I still expect something exciting: drinks, animated conversation, gaiety: an uninhibited exchange of ideas. Scott Fitzgerald's idea that somewhere things were \\"glimmering.\\" I am managing to discipline myself now so that I shan't be silly in this way. \\nNew York, Winter 1962\\n\\n Had dinner with Wystan Auden before Elena \\n[\\nWilson's wife\\n]\\n arrived. He was pleased at having what he described as an honor on the part of the Establishment. He has been made an honorary fellow (I think that is the phrase) of Christ Church \\n[\\nCollege, Oxford\\n]\\n. I gather that he can retire and live there for nothing. He thinks that \\"Down There on a Visit\\" is Isherwood's best book -- I was just in the middle of reading it. He says the disintegrating homo on his horrible island in Greece was a real person whom he knew and the only person he knew who would drink the spirits out of lamps when there was nothing else to be had. He thought that \\"Paul\\" was the best of the stories. I agreed with him when I came to read it","excerpt":"but the whole book is rather disgusting. I am getting sick of this subject. The attitude in these books toward homosexuality involves of course a revolt against society. See the diatribe of the man on the island about putting the heterosexuals in ghettos. Paul is made by Isherwood into a hero. But Genet is the best of these writers. He is the most in revolt, the most genuinely an outlaw. \\nCambridge, Spring 1962\\n\\n My ailments -- heart, teeth and gout -- and having endured another winter in Cambridge have lately been getting me down. I drink too much to get me out of my depression, then relapse into something like despair. The other night, after an active and serious day, I had a paroxysm of exasperation with Elena combined with an acute heart attack and smashed her filing cabinet, her typewriter and something else made of glass. She was frightened and called \\n[\\nthe novelist\\n]\\n Monroe Engel \\n[\\nacross the street\\n]\\n, who got me a doctor.

It is a relief to see glimpses of a court room that are totally different from the usual run of such scenes. In fact there is a strong vein of originality throughout this production, the narrative of which is told by means of a series of flashbacks, according to the testimony or deductions of the persons addressing the court.The early sequences at once capture one's interest, for Frederick Feber, the director, successfully steers clear of stereotyped camera effects. What he shows is exactly the impression many persons might obtain of a court-room scene. First, there is the empty court and then, with but a second's pause, the doors are thrown open by the attendant and a mass of morbidly curious humanity is struggling to get seated. This rush is a contrast to the leisurely manner in which the attorneys, the judges and the defendant, Clarissa Bunterbart, take their places in the enclosed area.Artist Bunterbart, Clarissa's elderly husband, was found dead with a bullet wound in his temple. Clarissa had been bound and chloroformed. This is brought out by the flashback scenes of the testimony of the prosecutor.The star witness for the prosecution is the Bunterbarts' butler, who has evidently formed his conclusions, and is therefore admonished by the presiding judge, who tells the butler to stick to facts and refrain from theories.Meanwhile the defendant, dressed in mourning, sometimes with a pathetic smile on her countenance, cringes before the austere and sometimes drowsy judges. There are fourteen persons on the jury, the additional two being in the box to serve only in the event of a juror being dismissed or taken ill.To go into much detail of this queer but interesting film might spoil it for those who intend visiting the Cameo. It is a delicate case, which, according to the subtitles, was referred to as \\"Le Proces Bunterbart.\\" It can, however, be set forth that in the end one feels that the jury may possibly have erred.Mr. Feber cleverly picks out two men in a rear seat of the court room before the trial starts and again soon after the jury has rendered its verdict. At first one of these men is seen surreptitiously lighting a cigarette and then his comrade bends down and takes a puff. When the trial is ended, the two men are perceived discussing the case, and possibly what they think is what may occur to those who have learned about the testimony through the screen while seated in the theatre.Magda Sonja, who played the title role of Mati Hari, here impersonates the accused wife. Gustav Diesel is capital as the butler. Carl Gotz figures as the husband and Karl Ettlinger as Clarissa's attorney.Chaplin's ancient comedy, \\"The Floor Walker,\\" proved to be quite amusing.

He was born again in 1968, during a second visit to Paris, when he was ''caught up'' in the student demonstrations. These Parisian rebirths, in Mr. Brink's own formulations, were political, literary, metaphysical and sexual, the outcome of a ''romantic love-affair'' with the city.

Some scholars have argued that opera's evolution toward the age of Verdi and Wagner made Rossini feel increasingly out of date","excerpt":"but there are contrasting indications that the composer's agile intelligence became impatient with operatic conventions old and new.   \\"Le Comte Ory,\\" Rossini's farewell to comic opera, looks like an old-fashioned buffo romp at first glance, but it has hidden depths and peculiarities. Philip Gossett, America's foremost Rossini scholar, notes its \\"sexual and musical shadows, disguises and illusions.\\" The plot revolves around Ory's attempted seduction of a Countess whose husband is away at the Crusades; in the final trio, Ory, dressed as a nun, thinks he has embraced the Countess in the dark, only to find that it is his own manservant Isolier (sung by a mezzo-soprano). Avoiding the madcap setting that convention might have demanded, Rossini writes off-kilter and slitheringly chromatic music for this scene; order is restored in the martial finale, but an intriguing tone of decadence lingers.   These reflections are prompted by Tuesday night's smoothly idiomatic rendition of \\"Le Comte Ory\\" given in concert form by the Opera Francais de New York, at Gould Hall. Yves Abel, the company's director, gave the buffo episodes brilliance and bite, the lyric stretches a spacious eloquence. Since Mr. Abel founded the group in 1988, the Opera Francais has acquired a reputation as a fine independent company; for the most part, this performance did not frustrate expectations.   Jeffrey Francis, a tenor, took the title role's murderously broad range in stride; a nasal edge to his voice enhanced the antiheroic side of Ory's character, although toward the beginning his delivery should have been more seductively fluid. Lauren Flanigan, a soprano, sometimes seemed too powerful as the timid Countess, but her virtuosity drew shouts of praise from the audience. Kristine Jepson was an accomplished Isolier, singing with assurance high into her upper range.   The supporting cast had a couple of weaknesses: Joy Hermalyn did not provide enough contrasting delicacy as the Countess's companion, Ragonde, and the enthusiastic Jan Opalach had moments of wavering intonation as the tutor. But Philip Cokorinos, a bass-baritone, made the most of the opera's comic highlight, Raimbaud's drinking aria. Nathalie Morais, Paul D. Moore and Pierre Lorieau filled out the cast.    The orchestra played with energy and eloquence; there were some odd sounds from the string section, but the wind playing blended elegantly with the voices. The chorus propelled the action handsomely.

The combination of 1927 colloquialisms and ideas with the replicas of ancient settings and modes makes this film most amusing. It is skillfully produced, but there are omments when it would seem that the fun could have been more infectious. Alexander Korda, the director, has, in a manner, set forth this piece of humor with a sense of restraint. The production is an ambitious affair, with great hosts of people and monster stage settings.Quite a good deal of credit is due to the title writer for the humor and also to Carl Edouarde for his arrangement of the musical score. Following a scene in Troy, some of the scandalmongers are beheld discussing the exploits of Paris and what may happen if he goes to Sparta. One of these gossipers ventures:\\"There's a Queen in Troy, and if Paris goes there, God save the King.\\"For his part, Mr. Edouarde contributes just the musical selections that are part and parcel of Professor Erskine's humorous study. The intermittent theme that accompanies the unfurling of the film is decidedly appropriate, for it is \\"Lady Be Good.\\" When the monster horse is slowly tugged into Troy, Mr. Edouarde's musicians are impelled to delight the audience with that modern classic, \\"Horses, Horses, Horses.\\" And when Helen returns to Troy with Menelaos, the orchestra indulges in a few bars of \\"Home, Sweet Home.\\"No better choice than Maria Corda could have been made for the rôle of Helen. She is quietly amusing, graceful, fascinating and fully cognizant of her feminine attraction as the fair lady who stirred up wars. This Helen has an eye for love wherever she finds \\"It,\\" and it is no concern of her's that the Trojan dressmakers are vastly superior to the more conservative modistes of Sparta. The fact that the creations of Troy are becoming scantier and scantier rather fills Helen with pleasure, but there are times when she relishes an extensive metallic cloth costume, because it shows off her figure.Maria Corda's eyes twinkle merrily as she inveigles her victims over a cup of wine. And why shouldn't this Helen beguile Paris? Does not her husband, King Menelaos, think of nought else but going fishing? Moreover he snores at night. Imagine then our Helen, after eloping with Paris, discovering that that young gentleman has also acquired the art of snoring. It is distressing to Helen, especially as she no way of turning back to Sparta, being on the ship bound for Troy. A pretty state of affairs!Unwittingly, Helen rather evens up matters with Paris (who is alluded to in the captions as H. R. H. Paris), when she calmly insists that the Spartan horse be pulled into Troy. How could she, this gorgeous creature, know that the wily Menelaos was inside the horse with a hundred men?When the giant horse stands within the city's limits, Helen, ever thoughtless, mediates only on the adornment to the city, and she asks that it be placed a little to the left, where it will hide that awful building, the City Hall. Even when she is about to meet her irate spouse after he captures Troy, Helen takes good care that her gown is draped effectively as she stands before him ready to die by his dagger. But Menelaos is not that kind of a husband. He forgives her and back they go to Sparta, leaving Paris to die for all Helen cares.Perhaps Helen might have turned over a new leaf, but it chances toward the end of this narrative that a good-looking young Prince of Ithaca appears upon the scene and when Menelaos is aware that Helen is incorrigible, that she is again up to her old flirtatious tricks, instead of being annoyed or vindictive, he merely says to Eteoneous:\\"I think Helen will soon be going to Ithaca, so now we will go fishing.\\"Lewis Stone gives a capital performance as the nonchalant Menelaos. He snores, he yawns, he hates wars","excerpt":"but there you are, if a country demands it one must. Tom O'Brien figures as the belligerent Ulysses, ever hopeful for a conflict. Ulysses is perceived admonishing the Spartan throngs \\"to give till it hurts\\" and all that sort of thing. Charles Puffy is not especially impressive as Ajax. George Fawcett is a very worried Eteoneus. Ricardo Cortez makes Paris a lovelorn specimen.Before the, screening of the picture, Professor Erskine appeared upon the stage and said that he had written about the more discreet part of Helen's life. He referred to the \\"lovely picture,\\" and when he was about to introduce Maria Corda, he said that since talking with the actress he could hardly remember his previous conception of Helen. THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1984","title":"David Rabe's ''Hurlyburly'' is set in an all-male household somewhere ''in the Hollywood hills.'' So the program at the Promenade Theater tells us, so the dialogue of the play itself confirms.  But if you look through the panes of glass that serve as the back wall of Tony Walton's set, you actually see nothing but leaves, stems, rushes, grass, a wild tangle of green thickly straggling out to the wings, up to the flies, and (so you feel) out into the dressing rooms behind the stage. It could be part of some Amazonian rain-forest. It could be a slice of jungle in the country which did so much to shape Mr. Rabe and his earlier work: Vietnam.    And so it is, in a way.

It was not until the dawn of July 5, 1784, that the newly appointed envoy (assisting Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in negotiating commercial treaties) sailed out of Boston Harbor for the ''vaunted scene of Europe'' where he would spend the five happiest years of his life. Later he wrote his friend James Madison urging him to follow and observed that for the slight cost of the trip ''you will have purchased the knowledge of another world.'' JEFFERSON ABROAD"},{"year":"1921","title":"If Bernard Shaw were the author of \\"The Iron Trail,\\" at the Strand this week, there woul be ground for suspicion that the picture was a sly joke on the public. But Rex Beach is the author and he has never been accused of literary waggery. So the explanation of the photoplay must lie in some other direction. Maybe it's simply a case of carelessness, due to hurry or to the assumption by Mr. Beach, his scenarist or his director, that the credulous public really will believe anything they are told in a work of fiction. And maybe they, that is a sufficiently large number of them, will. \\"The Iron Trail\\" ought to afford interesting evidence on the subject.For seldom has a photoplay so blandly ignored the dramatic law that requires a story to substantiate its direct assertions by the evidence of character and action. This law, like many others, is a dead letter unless public opinion enforces it, and the truly amazing thing about \\"The Iron Trail\\" is the assurance with which it assumes that the law will not be enforced. It seems to take it for granted that no one will ask questions, or seek to be convinced on any point.For example, the story's characterizations are all by label. That is, the villian is a mean-looking fellow and spectators are told in a subtitle that he's a crooked railroad man. The hero, on the other hand, is a clean-cut chap and the spectators are informed that he's an honest railroad man. But neither does anything to establish the character given him. As a matter of fact—and here's where humor would be suspected if Shaw were the author—the hero does a number of things that would normally be expected of the villain, and the villain is sometimes the victim of high-handed methods on the part of the hero.The two men are rivals, trying to outdo each other in the building of a railroad in Alaska. The villain, who is said to be a dishonest railroad man, gives every sign of trying to build as real a railroad as the hero's, so where his dishonesty comes in is not clear. But let that go. He's a villain for opposing the hero, anyhow. And he has deep black marks under his eyes. Also he speaks roughly to his wife and stepdaughter. So there's no sympathy for him. But how are you going to get away from the fact that when he and the hero clash over the possession of a certain piece of property right is admittedly on his side, while only might, dynamite, to be precise, is on the side of the hero. Here are the facts of the case. The villain sends his workmen to establish a right of way over the property, and the hero sets off charges of dynamite ahead of them, threatening to blow them up if they don't turn back. The villain challeges the hero's tactics, and says that he'll appeal to the law, to which the hero replies in substance, \\"That's all right, but this is Alaska, and you'll be lucky if you get a decision in five years.\\" Isn't there some kind of a mix-up here. Surely the hero and villain are in each other's shoes.Nor is the rest of the story any more consistent. The ending is particularly incredible. It asks the spectator to believe that a railroad bridge which is certain to be swept away by the rush of ice down a river may be made safe enough for a love-scene by the driving of a few rivets some forty feet above the water level. The bridge is shown. Its steel work rests on heavy stone or concrete pillars. As the Alaskan ice is beginning to break up in the Spring the workmen are just finishing it. You are given to understand that if they don't complete it, it will not be strong enough to withstand the flood of ice. They get it almost done, working day and night until the very moment of the arrival of the ice. Then, with only a few more rivets to drive, they run away. The ice is upon them and they will not stay on the structure. But the hero, with two of his faithful lieutenants and the heroine, dash out on the brige and drive the rivets. And it is saved, so well saved, in fact, that the hero and heroine stop right there to declare and demonstrate their love for each other. And then, when a picture of the whole bridge is shown, you see that the lowest steel girder or plate is at least forty feet above the water, and you wonder—or don't you!—how a few rivets so high up could be the only thing that stood between the preservation and the destruction of the bridge. But maybe one ought not to ask questions at the movies.Anyhow, there are some thrilling scenes of the breaking up and carrying away of ice in \\"The Iron Trail\\" which you can enjoy without doubts. They would be just as thrilling in a scenic picture, and in fact they, or some just like them, have been","excerpt":"but they are thrilling, at any rate.The production was directed by R. William Neill. Thurston Hall is the villain, Wyndham Standing is the hero, Alma Tell is the heroine, Reginald Denny is the first assistant hero and Betty Carpenter is the first assistant heroine.Also on the Strand program is \\"The Applicant,\\" a comedy, with Jimmy Aubrey.Apparently no one would write a melodrama wild and free enough for \\"William S. Hart, so he's done it for himself. He is the author of \\"White Oak\\" at the Rialto this week.Hart has fought and licked half a dozen men with his bare fists, he has used two guns effectively against a whole gang, and he has outridden a posse of pursuers. But these feats have become too tame. So now he appears as the victor over a whole tribe of Indians. He receives word that the Indians are attacking a wagon train. He is in a near-by town and might raise a small army to go to the rescue of the settlers, but such a thing, it appears, never enters his head. Armed with a muzzle-loading rifle and a revolver, he goes alone to the rescue, and from rocky vantage points picks off the Indians one by one until the few who are left alive take refuge in flight. Then the men who been attacked by the Indians, and who had almost equaled them in numbers from the beginning, ride out to give pursuit. It seems that any one of them might have done what Oak Miller, as Mr. Hart, did, but, of course, if he had, he, and not Oak Miller, would have been the hero of the tale, and that never would have done.But there are some stirring pictures of Redskins biting the dust in \\"White Oak\\" besides gambling house scenes, a superhumanly intelligent dog and lots of other things to give those who like their melodramas straight their money's worth. The picture was directed by Lambert Hillyer, and Vola Vale is Mr. Hart's heroine this time.Buster Keaton's comedy, \\"Hard Luck,\\" which accompanied \\"The Golem\\" in its run at the Criterion, is also on the bill.\\"Enchantment,\\" with Marion Davies, directed by Robert G. Vignola, is at the Rivoli, and \\"Shame,\\" directed by Emmett J. Flynn, which was at the Lyric last August, is the photoplay at the Capitol this week.

The Party of Isolationism"},{"year":"1920","title":"People have been asking recently, \\"Why doesn't Mary Pickford grow up?\\" The question is answered at the Rivoli this week. It is evident that Miss Pickford doesn't grow up because she can make more people laugh and cry, can win her way into more hearts, and even protesting heads, as a rampant, resilient little girl than as anything else. She can no more grow up than Peter Pan. When she stops being a child on the screen, she'll probably just stop. But that time is a long way off.These things seem demonstrated by Miss Pickford's latest picture, \\"Pollyanna.\\" Seldom before has she been as completely and unalterably a child as in the screen version of Eleanor Porter's well-known story. She doesn't even grow up for the last, lingering love-lock with which all orthodox movies must end. Her \\"leading man\\" is Howard Ralston, surely not over 15 years old, and their dream, with which the picture closes, is such as two children would have. He becomes a rich motormon and takes his wife and family out for a free ride every Sunday afternoon. He appears, impressively attired in uniform, cap, badge, and everything, in command of his car. She wears an encumbering dress, much too long and too big for her every way, but with his help succeeds in loading their eighteen or twenty children into the car, and away they go for a free ride.This sort of thing, of course, is certain to delight children, but will adults, therefore, be bored or, at most, mildly amused by it? Some, perhaps","excerpt":"but they didn't seem to be present yesterday afternoon. Whether they were ashamed of it or not, they gave every sign of enjoying the picture as much as any little tot in the house. They laughed, and in the sentimental places—they blew their noses. Today they may say that \\"Pollyanna\\" is too silly and saccharin, but they couldn't tell it so to its face yesterday afternoon.It is true that there are objections to such a story as \\"Pollyanna.\\" This \\"glad game\\" deliberately played, this eternally, infernally, ???ent optimism—well, in a human being with whom one comes into work-a-day contact it is a provocation to justifiable homicide, but somenow objections seem to wab??? and fall down before Mary Pickford's \\"Pollyanna.\\" In the first place, she is so extremely enjoyable as a little girl, regardless of her constant \\"be glad,\\" and, in the second place, although she applies joy to everybody, she doesn't rub it in. In the third, fourth, fifth, and other places, she is surrounded by a delightful cast in a remarkably well-made moving picture. Young Mr. Ralston is a real boy, and Helen Jerome Eddy, who has played leading parts in \\"The Turn of the Road\\" and other productions, is a screen actress of ability, and shows it again in the part of a very human maid. Paul Powell, the director, used his material well, and made many neat pictures. Frances Marion did her share in the writing of the scenario.\\"Pollyanna\\" is Miss Pickford's first work for the United Artists' Corporation, formed by D. W. Griffith, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin and herself. It is reported that she was the real boss of the production, and, if so, proved herself a competent one.\\"The Cloud,\\" the beautiful Post scenic illustrating Shelley's poem of the same name, which was shown at the Rivoli some months ago, is there again this week. Those accustomed to walk on paved streets with their heads down and a soft coal smoke screen between them and the sky when they happen to look up, should see it once, if never before; twice, if they saw it the last time. It will do them good.Another picture of pure beauty is Burton Holmes's \\"Mirrors of Nature,\\" at the Strand. It shows what pictures are made by bridges, steeples, mountains, towns—and still water under them.The photoplay at the Strand is \\"The Beauty Market,\\" with Katharine MacDonald in the leading rôle. It takes itself seriously, but many of yesterday afternoon's spectators seemed to think it comic. They laughed just when the hero was telling the heroine that he had married her for hate, and would like to do all sorts of terrible things to her because she had cheated him, but, damn him, he couldn't because he loved her. The story is a stock \\"society romance\\" designed to overwhelm romancers of sweet sixteen, and the trouble yesterday was, perhaps, that the youthful ones, instead of being at the Strand, were skating in Central Park.Undeniably, Miss MacDonald is pretty, but the story was too much for her and the others in the cast, especially with its platitudinous and heavily heroic subtitles. It is about a girl who consents to marry for money, and when she is prevented by her own carelessness, coincidence and a villainness, marries for love a man who has plenty of money.\\"The Lone Wolf's Daughter,\\" a rather slow-moving melodrama not troubled by any regard for logic or possibility, is at the Capitol. Louise Glaum is in the leading rôle.\\"Life in Algeria,\\" a colored travel picture, is also on the program.\\"Nothing but the Truth,\\" with Taylor Holmes, came to the Broadway yesterday afternoon, and with it a stage offering called Cleveland Bronner's Revue. \\"The Cinema Murder,\\" with Marion Davies, and \\"The Rink,\\" a Chaplin revival, are at the Rialto.\\"Battlefields of France\\" was the subject of Burton Holmes's travelogue at Carnegie Hall last night.

Although they may publish hundreds of articles in journals aimed at other scientists, most never overcome the barriers of intelligibility separating scientists and the public. Stephen Jay Gould (''Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes''), Carl Sagan (''Broca's Brain'') and Lewis Thomas (''Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Mahler's Ninth Symphony'') are well-known exceptions, although even they have been accused of addressing primarily those who already know what scientists are talking about.   It's not that scientists are inherently insensitive to language or too arrogant to ''stoop'' to popularizing science - although this is certainly true of some. Rather, scientific writing follows a precisely specified structure that mirrors the research process - introduction, materials and methods, results and discussion. What scientists have to say to one another is poured into this mold. Thus trained to write in rigid partitions, scientists are spared the essayist's struggle to create a form appropriate to the occasion","excerpt":"but they find that what serves dispassionate discussion among colleagues serves not at all when writing for the public.

Whatever may be hoped for the future of the industry, at present the most significant fact is still that whenever a Hollywood \\"super\\" comes to London it engages the public attention to a degree which no Elstree output has yet succeeded in attaining. Just at the moment, for example, \\"Shanghai Express,\\" with Marlene Dietrich, and \\"Mata Hari,\\" with Greta Garbo, are topics of more frequent discussion than all the British pictures that have been shown since the advent of the \\"talkies.\\"This is not to say that such home-made successes as \\"Sunshine Susie,\\" \\"Good-Night, Vienna,\\" to mention only the most recent ones, have not been talked about as indicating that the last word has not been said in British production","excerpt":"but they have aroused only a mild general interest, whereas the relative merits of \\"Shanghai Express\\" and \\"Mata Hari,\\" and particularly the respective charms and abilities of Dietrich and Garbo, have excited hot debate.It is suggested in a review of the year's screen output published in a paper which claims to be \\"the national guide to the films\\" that since talking films arrived British pictures have occupied a position of previously unequaled interest and importance, that \\"the first British dialogue picture was a decidedly better production than the first Hollywood one,\\" and that (here is the sting) \\"many subsequent British pictures have run Hollywood so close that the disparity between the two producing centres today is one of commercial magnitude rather than artistic significance.\\"America's Hold.However much or little foundation there may be for this statement, it is a fact that by its system of mass production, mass publicity and mass penetration America has established a hold upon the British market from which it could only be driven either by a miracle of British effort or by an incredible blunder on the part of America. Before leaving this point it may be added that, while \\"Shanghai Express\\" has added to the reputation of Marlene Dietrich in a way which seems to justify her reported refusal to have any other director than Josef von Sternberg, \\"Mata Hari\\" has put Greta Garbo in the difficult position of having to ask herself whether her future will not be imperiled unless her employers and directors can produce her in something more suitable for her personality. Comparisons were never more invidious than those made here in London between these two famous stars and the media in which they appear in their new pictures.Of the two recent British films which possess any real claim to be outstanding, the more ambitious one is \\"The First Mrs. Fraser,\\" a screen version, or rather adaptation for the cinema, of St. John Ervine's play. This has been done by the Sterling Film Company, which specializes in big productions at unhappily long intervals. It is said that £80,000 sterling, which is a big sum for a British company to expend on a single picture, has been spent in the making of this one. It is certainly done on a lavish, not to say magnificent, scale.There is a cabaret scene which is as gorgeous as anything of the kind turned out from Hollywood, with a high-priced band performing and vaudeville stars doing their special turns. Though Miss Marie Tempest, whose delightful acting was perhaps the greatest attraction of the play when given at the Hay-market, does not appear in the film, Mr. Zimmerman, who runs the Sterling company, succeeded in inducing Henry Ainley to play the part in which he very successfully made his reappearance on the London stage, which he had adorned for many years, after a serious breakdown in health.Mr. Ainley's Film Bow.Along with \\"Harry,\\" as he is known to all his friends, Harold Huth, one of the best of the English film actors who have not been made by or gathered up by Hollywood, Miss Joan Barry, Miss Dorothy Dix and several other capable players figure in the film. This is Mr. Ainley's first appearance before the camera, and while it is apparent that he has not yet quite adapted himself to the difference of methods required for screen and stage, there is little doubt that with some more experience he will be a valuable recruit for the British film industry. Sinclair Hill, whose previous work had shown he possesses originality and imagination in technical production, directed the picture, and he has introduced some forms of pictorial expression which are certainly of interest as novel attempts to solve the problem of how best to translate a play from the stage to the cinema. Interesting as are these experiments in themselves, much of the charm and subtlety of the play has been lost in the process of over-elaboration of its incidents, and particularly of points which in the play itself were merely suggested by a spoken line or two but in the film are magnified into features.\\"The First Mrs. Fraser\\" has not yet been shown to the general public, but it is probable that its glamourous aspects will appeal more to the general public than they did to the critics, who had had the advantage of having seen the comedy in its original lightness and brightness. St. John Ervine was, with difficulty, persuaded to allow his play to be put on the screen, and is said to have insisted that \\"no monkey tricks\\" should be played with it in the process. Like the dour Ulsterman that he is, he is keeping his thoughts, now that he has seen what the result of cinemafication is strictly to himself.\\"Lily Christine\\" is the other new British production with pretensions to importance. It is really only partly British, for it comes from the American Paramount's British studios. It was rumored some time ago that the Paramount executive in America was, let us say, a little jealous of the success achieved by their British off-shoot with \\"Service for Ladies.\\" There will be no need for them to worry over \\"Lily Christine.\\" The picture, which is an adaptation of Michael Arlen's story, has had a superb send-off.A Charity Performance.Lady Furness, who is an American married to a wealthy ship-owner, hit upon the idea of getting a producing company to give a special première in aid of a charity. Paramount-British, with a keen eye to publicity and cognizant of Lady Furness's social influence and organizing ability, jumped at the suggestion, and the outcome was a gala performance at which a most fashionable audience, headed by the Prince of Wales and Prince George, both of whom are among Lady Furness's personal friends, paid sums ranging up to £10 for their seats, while Ambassador Mellon sent a cheque for 100 guineas. Lady Furness is handing over no less than £6,000 to the charity on whose behalf she organized the gala première; and Paramount-British got a splendid advertisement for \\"Lily Christine.\\" Miss Corinne Griffith and Colin Clive are the stars of the show, which, though by no means a bad one, is not to be compared with \\"Service for Ladies.\\"A new picture in which Herbert Marshall and Miss Edna Best appear together is always, or nearly always, an event in the annals of the British film industry. They do this in \\"The Faithful Heart,\\" an adaptation of a pleasantly sentimental comedy by Mr. Monckton-Hoffe which ran for a year at the Comedy Theatre here. The screen version has been admirably directed by Victor Saville and is altogether satisfying. Otherwise it has no particular pretension, but is any thing more necessary than that Herbert Marshall and Edna Best should be playing together in a setting not unworthy of them?A JUNGLE FILMFRANK BUCK'S wild animal film, \\"Bring 'Em Back Alive,\\" will be presented formally to Broadway some time next month, according to present plans. One of the oddest of the phenomena experienced by the Buck-Van Beuren expedition on its recent Malayan jungle trip was the spectacle of a nine-foot man-eating tiger climbing a tree. Mr. Buck says he has pictures to prove it. After days of beating in the jungle grass the expedition came on a tiger and a python engaged in a fight to the finish. The python had wrapped its coils around the tiger and was squeezing the animal's breath from its body. Suddenly in one supreme effort the tiger rolled over and over a dozen times, partially shaking the python off. Another moment of breath-catching rest and then off went the tiger in a wide circle, swishing this way and that until it shook loose from the huge reptile. When the last coils of the python had slipped from its back the tiger leaped high in the crotch of a forked tree with the python after her. Mr. Buck adds that he has four other animal fights to the death in \\"Bring 'Em Back Alive.\\" FILM NOTES FROM BRITAIN; Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich Vie With Each Other on London Screens"},{"year":"1920","title":"MILAN, Nov. 8.--Far-reaching political significance of the municipal elections which were fought out stubbornly in seven of the largest Italian industrial centres Sunday can scarcely be overrated.

Robert Donington argues that it works by evoking the most basic elements in our nature. This is from \\"Opera and Its Symbols: The Unity of Words, Music, and Staging\\" (Yale University).    We do not, in short, think of ourselves as renewing the patterns of the past when we fall into hope or fear or love or hate or any other of the immemorial predicaments of our human state. We are just contained in them for better and for worse","excerpt":"but this containment is not something we personally invented. Our basic human potentialities are in us from the start: only our individual versions are personal. . . . When archetypal material is presented to us artistically, we get some of the sensations of familiarity without any awareness of its unseen causes. We are gripped; we are absorbed; we are in all probability delighted, although there may also be some very real element of uncanny fear. . . . Confrontation with archetypal material is likely to be cathartic. Confrontation with the archetypes is the chief business of opera, spontaneously or deliberately as the case may be, and in mediocre specimens scarcely less inescapably than in the finest masterpieces. The Scientist as Explorer     The physicist Heinz R. Pagels, who died in 1988, believed that any quest for the absolute only gets in the way of good science. This is from his \\"Perfect Symmetry: The Search for the Beginning of Time\\" (Bantam, paper).    Maybe there is some final truth to the universe -- I do not know. Yet suspending such beliefs opens us to new ways of exploring. Later we can compare our new knowledge and beliefs with the old ones. Often such comparisons involve contradictions; but these, in turn, generate new creative insights about the order of reality. The capacity to tolerate complexity and welcome contradiction, not the need for simplicity and certainty, is the attribute of an explorer. Centuries ago, when some people suspended their search for absolute truth and began instead to ask how things worked, modern science was born. Curiously, it was by abandoning the search for absolute truth that science began to make progress, opening the material universe to human exploration. It was only by being provisional and open to change, even radical change, that scientific knowledge began to evolve. And ironically, its vulnerability to change is the source of its strength. Seduced by Facts     Wolfgang Kemp succinctly describes the reactions of some Victorians to that period's exuberant pursuit of facts. This is from \\"The Desire of My Eyes: The Life and Work of John Ruskin\\" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux).    People complained of having lost their emotions in the pursuit of facts, and the striking thing is that they now perceived this as a change for the worse. They were convinced that there were other ways to experience and describe the world, in fact that they themselves once practiced these ways, back when they \\"didn't know as much as they knew now.\\" Now they feared becoming \\"Dryasdusts,\\" as Carlyle dubbed mere fact-gatherers. They had expected more of themselves: poetic inspiration, all-embracing syntheses, ingenious reflections. But now the \\"subject under study\\" kept recalling them to duty, to the total and systematic registration of data demanded by the new standards of knowledge; and so they oscillated between painstaking diligence and emotional impulsiveness, between obligation and a freedom to which they laid claim but no longer possessed. Black humor . . . was not enough to help them rise above the malice of objects and their insecurities about their chosen role. The Unconsolable Liar     Many writers have catalogued the consequences of lying, but none have matched the assurance and grand music of Samuel Johnson's observations. His essay \\"The Lie of Vanity\\" is included in \\"The Penguin Book of Lies,\\" edited by Philip Kerr (Viking).    Almost every other vice that disgraces human nature, may be kept in countenance by applause and association. . . . The liar, and only the liar, is invariably and universally despised, abandoned, and disowned: he has no domestic consolation, which he can oppose to the censure of mankind; he can retire to no fraternity, where his crimes may stand in the place of virtues; but is given up to the hisses of the multitude, without friend and without apologist. It is the peculiar condition of falsehood, to be equally detested by the good and the bad: \\"The devils,\\" says Sir Thomas Browne, \\"do not tell lies to one another; for truth is necessary to all societies: nor can the society of hell subsist without it.\\" The Free, Necessary Poem     Sam Hamill borrows a term from Ivan Illich, \\"shadow work,\\" meaning work done without expectation of payment, to describe the unique experience of writing poetry. This is from \\"A Poet's Work: The Other Side of Poetry\\" (Broken Moon Press, paper).    Poetry is not commerce. It is not something to be exchanged or traded. It is a gift to the poet, a gift for which the poet, eternally grateful, spends a lifetime in preparation, and which the poet, in turn, gives away and gives away again. The actual work of preparation is shadow work: it must be performed without thought of money, and it is \\"essential\\" work in that it enables the poet to recognize and accept the gift and, in giving the gift away, do so with a great accompanying energy. But that energy, that experience we name poem, cannot be traded in the marketplace because it cannot be subverted. It won't light a lightbulb, run a heater or an air conditioner or a microwave oven. It is only a poem -- necessary, and inviolable, an articulation of a world beyond the possibilities of money.

On the dirt roads that lead east from the Androscoggin, on the old logging roads that branch off from Route 110 near the hamlet of Percy -- even on the shoulders of paved Route 3 up near the Canadian line. All over Coos County in New Hampshire, cars and pickups are finding convenient pull-offs near a muddy patch of bog, their drivers placing binoculars on the dashboard next to the camera, telling the kids to watch carefully, as everyone sits back and waits for dusk to settle, the first moose to arrive.   They seldom wait long, particularly in early summer. All that road salt poured on the pavement for winter's ice and snow has leached down into the gullies along the shoulders, and the moose are crazy for it, more than willing to put up with some flash bulbs popping off in order to lick their fill.

The Administration has been moving from dignified, justified anger toward political opportunism. Thus inspired, the Governors of New York and New Jersey pretend that American mobs endanger the Soviet Foreign Minister, and hand him a pretext for not coming to be censured at the United Nations.

It is a slangy tale of two pals, \\"an acrobatic team,\\" who decide that no girl shall interfere with their friendship","excerpt":"but to carry out the idea, the characters are frequently called upon to be somewhat dense. The story, however, seemed to hold the interest of an audience yesterday afternoon and the comedy interludes provided the desired merriment.\\"Nix on Dames\\"is adroitly filmed, with most of the scenes in a vaudeville troupers' boarding-house in the West Forties. There are several effective sequences, notably one depicting the activities of the performers in their respective apartments. One hears the bedlam made by barking dogs, musicians and singers. In another episode the tenants give a party in which all are garbed in their stage costumes.In the opening scene Bert Wills and Johnny Brown are limbering up for their acrobatic act with a pole. Wills holds the pole and while Brown is climbing to the top the pole breaks. Brown falls, injuring his arm, in which he had been wounded in France.Just as one anticipates, a girl soon interests both the friends. She is an exception! In the course of this chronicle she sings a song to the effect that while one can have two friends, one can have only one sweetheart. This young woman, known as Jackie Lee, is ably portrayed by Mae Clarke. Both men take an unusual interest in Jackie and when Brown is able to use his arm again and is ready for work there arises a misunderstanding which ends in a hot fight between the pals.The act then, subsequently, is known as Wills and Wills, for Jackie becomes Mrs. Wills. As for Brown, he weds a singer who was a war nurse and they go to live in Kentucky.Robert Ames gives a highly satisfactory performance as Wills and so does William Harrigan as Brown. The developments in the narrative may not be especially stirring, but the modulated voices with brisk dialogue keeps up a certain interest for those who are not surfeited with yarns of this ilk.The most striking number on the stage program is that called \\"Pastelle.\\" in which there is a huge painting, with a palette and brushes of relative proportions. Soon a scrim is raised on the picture and the half a dozen figures in the actual frame corns to life, with a number of others pouring from within the frame.\\"The Spirit of Jazz\\" is a pleasing sketch, with the Roxyette dancers and Ruth and Beatrice Glenn as singers.

As it stands one can't help thinking that three talented players have been wasted on this photoplay.It is a shadow story which causes one to sigh frequently, not in sympathy with the film, but with one's self, or because one feels that one's intelligence is so often insulted. There are subtitles with artificial baby chatter and others in which the characters are credited with preposterous utterances. We would have thought that a man who had sense enough to read portions of Bunyan's \\"Pilgram's Progress\\" to his children would have had enough persistence and imagination to earn his own living and take his hard knocks with courage and a smile. Lester Knapp, the father and husband, is a comparatively young man, and yet because he is discharged from his job he goes all to pieces, meditating over suicide. He finally injures himself so that he is confined to a wheel chair.His action is only palliated by his hope that he would be killed, so that the $10,000 life insurance would go to his family. After the supposed accident the wife goes forth in search of work, and eventually succeeds in earning twice as much as her husband did when he was employed. Knapp satisfies himself by proving that he is a better guardian for the children than their mother.In an early sequence Knapp is deeply disappointed when his rival is promoted to the office managership. The head of the concern invites Knapp into his private office and informs him that he is going to appoint the other man. This is in itself unusual and spiteful, as one would think that the employer would have contented himself by merely telling the rival of his promotion. Then the new manager is made to take his authority in a childish fashion as he announces to Knapp:\\"I'm your boss from now on.\\"Mrs. Knapp is impersonated by Alice Joyce, who is out of her element in such a role. She is seen scrubbing a floor, apparently concentrating her elbow grease on a part of the boards about a foot long and six inches wide. They have a boy who has an unfortunate complaint, which is brought to the fore in a disturbing way, and another youngster who is bad-tempered and crafty. In an elementary fashion the director shows the thoughts of Mrs. Knapp one day when she can't find her child. Mr. Baggot flashes to an express train with the little boy standing in the middle of the tracks.Clive Brook does handsomely by the character of Knapp, taking undue pains with his acting. Miss Joyce is far better suited to roles in which she is attractively gowned, as one can't imagine her as a struggling housewife. George Fawcett, that dependable actor, does his share of good work as the old doctor who makes a wonderful discovery and keeps the patient's secret.It needed a man with Ernst Lubitsch's imagination to make a pleasing picture out of this story. Mr. Baggot has misconstrued that which is entertaining to the public, and he has emphasized things that could be taken for granted and skipped over details which might have made this picture much more interesting.

In this early morning glimpse, Constance Talmadge and Don Alvarado are perceived enjoying breakfast on a spot far enough away from a restaurant to be like the fifth green of the average golf links.Malcolm St. Clair, who was responsible for \\"The Grand Duchess and the Waiter,\\" directed this mildly diverting but not especially spirited piece of work. The story, such as it is, is unfurled with strict attention to shimmering costumes, and impressive settings that cause one to imagine that Mr. St. Clair is thinking of outdoing Cecil B. De Mille's bedroom and bathroom backgrounds. Here the bathroom looks as if it had been constructed so as to make a man from the plains think that he is still outdoors. The bedrooms are also spacious and expensively furnished. Roughly, one would think that one of them would fit into a floor of the usual Park Avenue apartment.Miss Talmadge impersonates Madeleine, whose sole worry is not how she is going to get her new costumes and furs, but where. She is quite interested in a philandering Marquis, who, in turn, delights in every pair of feminine eyes he sees. Don Alvarado plays the part of an earnest and unaffected young man who sighs for the undivided affection of a blond, named Loulou, who, incidentally behaves as one would expect a girl named Loulou to behave.It all begins just as the celebrated Champignol is nervously awaiting the paying guests at the opening of his new hotel. Being a natural publicity expert he realizes the necessity of having the place full, and to make sure that there are no empty rooms he helps matters along by having non-paying guests","excerpt":"but to protect himself against wholesale ravages of his caviar and his wines he causes to be printed on the menus:\\"Non-paying guests will not be served with wine or caviar.\\"Lussan (Don Alvarado) happens to be in the unfortunate position of a non-paying guest at the table of the affluent and brilliant Madeleine. Madeleine's Marquis is at another table with Loulou and it is Madeleine who suggests the semblance of an affair between herself and Lussan, who soon finds himself eating caviar and drinking champagne. Madeleine is not satisfied with the result of their plot, so she asks Lussan to marry her and remain married, so far as appearances are concerned, until the Marquis comes \\"groveling on his knees\\" to her. Again Lussan consents.However, the inconstancy of the Marquis and the fact that Loulou has so many admirers that she forgets most of their names makes this plan of man and maid gang aglee. There are, nevertheless, no regrets in the final fade-out.Mr. St. Clair has introduced some expert effects and Miss Talmadge helps the picture by her fetching appearance and costly gowns. Don Alvarado is restrained and good-looking and his dark hair makes an excellent contrast to Miss Talmadge's golden coiffure.

To begin with, his premises are fantastic: (a) in an era of cost cutting, he proposes that companies will pay employees full salary for what constitutes 80 percent productivity and then make up the ''slack'' by hiring more workers; (b) in a climate of political apathy, he thinks people at large will rally and unite around the issue of full employment; (c) in a complex economy, he suggests that the Treasury will be saved by the taxes of hordes of low-paid part-time workers who have already been excluded from the tax structure by new legislation.   In addition, Mr. Riessman severely misunderstands the dynamic of time in the work place, which thrives on consistency - so much so that an aberration of hours can be tolerated at only the most rudimentary level, such as retail sales (often with less than satisfactory results for labor and consumer). Keep in mind, too, that part-time employees may feel as if they do not have any real stake in the day-to-day crises of a company: a given problem was there before they came to work and will probably be resolved before they return.

Although technology and personal vision have changed the style of the magazine's photography, the belief in photography as what the book's author, Leah Bendavid-Val, calls \\"the ultimate eyewitness\\" seems stronger than ever. Ms. Bendavid-Val, a senior editor at National Geographic Books, writes that the use of color portrays \\"foreign scenes more accurately and graphically than black and white.\\" Undermining this notion of truth in color is the book's striking cover, a portrait of a young Afghan refugee, her face framed by a loose rust-colored scarf, set against a soft green background that accentuates her hazel eyes.

He spent most of the years covered by this exhibition back in Cuba, driven there by the war in 1941, and during this time he integrated Cubist and Surrealist innovations with symbols and motifs of his own Afro-Cuban culture.

Although this subject at times descends to farce, there are a number of sequences wherein Melville B. Brown, the director, through the ready and natural expressions at the performers, is able to dispense with cumbersome subtitles. It is a picture that catches your interest the minute after you have taken your seat, and yet the plot is relatively thin.Mr. Brown has for some time been a continuity writer and a scenarist. It was he who furnished the script for \\"The Goose Woman,\\" a photoplay that dealt with the \\"Pig Woman\\" of the Hall-Mills murder mystery. Mr. Brown's early work in pictures was as a gag man, and he officiated in that capacity for Charlie Chaplin and others.As this feature is unfurled one does not often hear loud outbursts of laughter. The amusement is more genuine, the sort of picture in which there is fun every scene. There are, toward the end, some clever double exposures, in which Laura La Plante is seen as Frances Norcross and Miss Dix, a screen star.It is a case of a picture producer having to find a double for a star who has been kidnapped aboard a wealthy man's yacht. J. G. Adams, a popcorn-eating newspaper reporter, looks forward to writing a whale of a story if Miss Dix does not make a personal appearance at the screening of her latest film. Myers, the producer, thinks that he will be ruined if Miss Dix is not found","excerpt":"but Tom Barrett, an imaginative and resourceful publicity agent, comes to the rescue by finding Frances Norcross, a wonderful double for Miss Dix. Miss Norcross differs from Miss Dix in that she trembles at the thought of standing on a stage before a large audience. Further complications are added to this yarn through Miss Dix's husband not being able to recognize Miss Norcross from his own wife. And why should he?Mack Swain impersonates Myers, and when he lifts up his hands in woe it reminds one of his performance as \\"Big\\" Jim McKay in \\"The Gold Rush.\\" Here his worry is caused by a golden-haired girl, instead of yellow nuggets.Miss La Plante's work in this photoplay is better than that in any of her other screen efforts. Lee Moran keeps the action going swiftly, never forgetting that the eyes tell a lot on the screen. Einer Hansen drops in occasionally to capture his sweetheart and Tully Marshall lends a good deal of humor by his natural grimaces and expressions. He eats too much popcorn, but one can forgive him for that weakness. He cannot be accused of being a typical newspaper man, but rather the invention of a gag man.

It is based on a play called \\"Drifting,\\" which was written by John Colton and the late Daisy H. Andrews and presented here in 1922, with Alice Brady in the leading rôle. The story has been somewhat changed for the screen, but the pivotal situation remains. To do it justice, however, it would need a greater versatility than is displayed by Mary Nolan in her acting to fulfill the demands of the part created by Miss Brady.\\"Shanghai Lady\\" is the first audible film to be directed by John S. Robertson, an earnest but a rather unimaginative director. The trouble with this present work is obviously not all at his door, but it seems surprising that he did not insist upon alterations in the script so that the narrative would have been a trifle less ludicrous.So far as Miss Nolan's interpretation is concerned, she ought to have been more subdued to carry out the scheme of things. Her part is that of Cassie Cook, a gay young woman who meets with disfavor because of a fight in a disreputable place in Shanghai.The man in the film is \\"Badlands\\" McKinney, acted by James Murray, who first appears with a stubby growth on his jaws and chin, having performed the feat of escaping from a Chinese prison. Through the amazing good offices of an Oriental girl, McKinney finds himself the possessor of a well-filled wallet, and he decides to go to Pekin. Cassie is at the railroad station, apparently intending to make the journey on her looks and her winning smile. Her angel turns out to be McKinney, who only has to hear her suggest something she wants, to go forth to get it.Cassie is none too careful in her speech. Her slang and poses would not be welcome in the average drawing-room. She is, however, blond and attractive and the dense Mr. McKinney believes Cassie when she tells him that she is a \\"lady.\\" It is such a relief for McKinney to meet a lady. He then poses as Mr. Jarvis and, as he conducts himself with restraint, he is a much more believable Mr. Jarvis than Cassie is a Miss Preston.In the course of their adventures they find it necessary to leave Pekin in a hurry because of insurrectionists. Mr. Jarvis and Miss Preston travel over the country by ox-cart. They camp in a spot near a gurgling brook (the gurgle being very pronounced), and Mr. Jarvis says that he will go up the stream to fetch some water. Why he couldn't get it where he was is not quite clear: but he goes, and soon one sees McKinney, alias Jarvis, bending over the calm water in which he sees his physiognomy reflected. Like Narcissus, he takes a good look at himself","excerpt":"but unlike Narcissus, he is thinking of his past. Modestly (one surmises) he feels that he is not fit to associate with Miss Preston. She, meanwhile, is experiencing similar attacks of conscience.Later, when \\"Badlands\\" is held up at the point of a pistol and told that he must surrender himself, he pleads to have half an hour in a private dining room with Miss Preston. He orders tea, and while the menial bears in a tray with tea and so forth, this almond-eyed one thinks that he might as well offer the guests a bottle of whisky. Mr. Jarvis is visibly annoyed as he emphasizes that he ordered \\"tea.\\" Quite obviously \\"Badlands\\" feels that the mere sight of a whisky bottle might offend Miss Preston's finer sensibilities.All this is sketched in a bludgeon-like fashion, leaving one wondering why \\"Badlands\\" is so blind that he can't tell that Cassie is no shining social light. Mr. Robertson, so far as this writer can remember, gives no change of clothes to either of his characters, but he insists that Cassie shall always have her phonograph with her.It is true that it is a melodrama, but even in such ruddy affairs there should be a certain amount of reason. In the end, as one presumes so soon as they meet, Cassie becomes Mrs. \\"Badlands\\" McKinney, after both are quite clear regarding each other's past. Mr. McKinney, however, keeps the specific nature of his wrongdoing a secret, or Mr. Robertson does. THE SCREEN; The Masqueraders.

Casey. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, and David H. Souter jointly wrote an opinion for the Court upholding a portion of the regulations -- an \\"informed consent\\" provision and a 24-hour waiting period -- and reaffirming the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion, but declaring unconstitutional a requirement that women seeking abortions notify their husbands. Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry A. Blackmun each wrote an opinion arguing that all the restrictions should have been found unconstitutional.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia each wrote dissenting opinions, joined in both instances by Justices Byron R. White and Clarence Thomas, arguing that the Court should have overturned Roe v. Wade. FROM THE DECISION By Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter   Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt. Yet 19 years after our holding that the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages, Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), that definition of liberty is still questioned. Joining the respondents as amicus curiae, the United States, as it has done in five other cases in the last decade, again asks us to overrule Roe.   At issue in these cases are five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 as amended in 1988 and 1989. The Act requires that a woman seeking an abortion give her informed consent prior to the abortion procedure, and specifies that she be provided with certain information at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed. For a minor to obtain an abortion, the Act requires the informed consent of one of her parents, but provides for a judicial bypass option if the minor does not wish to or cannot obtain a parent's consent. Another provision of the Act requires that, unless certain exceptions apply, a married woman seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicating that she has notified her husband of her intended abortion. The Act exempts compliance with these three requirements in the event of a \\"medical emergency,\\" which is defined in Sections 3203 of the Act. In addition to the above provisions regulating the performance of abortions, the Act imposes certain reporting requirements on facilities that provide abortion services.   Before any of these provisions took effect, the petitioners, who are five abortion clinics and one physician representing himself as well as a class of physicians who provide abortion services, brought this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Each provision was challenged as unconstitutional on its face. The District Court entered a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the regulations, and, after a 3-day bench trial, held all the provisions at issue here unconstitutional, entering a permanent injunction against Pennsylvania's enforcement of them. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the regulations except for the husband notification requirement. . . .    And at oral argument in this Court, the attorney for the parties challenging the statute took the position that none of the enactments can be upheld without overruling Roe v. Wade. We disagree with that analysis","excerpt":"but we acknowledge that our decisions after Roe cast doubt upon the meaning and reach of its holding. Further, the Chief Justice admits that he would overrule the central holding of Roe and adopt the rational relationship test as the sole criterion of constitutionality. State and Federal courts as well as legislatures throughout the union must have guidance as they seek to address this subject in conformance with the Constitution. Given these premises, we find it imperative to review once more the principles that define the rights of the woman and the legitimate authority of the state respecting the termination of pregnancies by abortion procedures.   After considering the fundamental constitutional questions resolved by Roe, principles of institutional integrity, and the rule of stare decisis, we are led to conclude this: the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed.   It must be stated at the outset and with clarity that Roe's essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the state's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the state's power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger a woman's life or health. And third is the principle that the state has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.  These principles do not contradict one another; and we adhere to each.                    . . .         Men and women of good conscience can disagree, and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage. Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code. The underlying constitutional issue is whether the state can resolve these philosophic questions in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter, except perhaps in those rare circumstances in which the pregnancy is itself a danger to her own life or health, or is the result of rape or incest.   It is conventional constitutional doctrine that where reasonable people disagree the Government can adopt one position or the other. That theorem, however, assumes a state of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon a protected liberty. Thus, while some people might disagree about whether or not the flag should be saluted, or disagree about the proposition that it may not be defiled, we have ruled that a state may not compel or enforce one view or the other.   Our cases recognize \\"the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\\" Eisenstadt v. Baird. Our precedents \\"have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.\\" Prince v. Massachusetts. These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.   These considerations begin our analysis of the woman's interest in terminating her pregnancy but cannot end it, for this reason: though the abortion decision may originate within the zone of conscience and belief, it is more than a philosophic exercise. Abortion is a unique act. It is an act fraught with consequences for others: for the woman who must live with the implications of her decision; for the persons who perform and assist in the procedure; for the spouse, family, and society which must confront the knowledge that these procedures exist, procedures some deem nothing short of an act of violence against innocent human life; and, depending on one's beliefs, for the life or potential life that is aborted. Though abortion is conduct, it does not follow that the State is entitled to proscribe it in all instances. That is because the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition and so unique to the law. The mother who carries a child to full term is subject to anxieties, to physical constraints, to pain that only she must bear.                    . . .         Although Roe has engendered opposition, it has in no sense proven \\"unworkable,\\" representing as it does a simple limitation beyond which a state law is unenforceable.                    . . .         But to do this would be simply to refuse to face the fact that for two decades of economic and social developments, people have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail. The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. The Constitution serves human values, and while the effect of reliance on Roe cannot be exactly measured, neither can the certain cost of overruling Roe for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed.   No evolution of legal principle has left Roe's doctrinal footings weaker than they were in 1973. No development of constitutional law since the case was decided has implicitly or explicitly left Roe behind as a mere survivor of obsolete constitutional thinking.                    . . .         We have seen how time has overtaken some of Roe's factual assumptions: advances in maternal health care allow for abortions safe to the mother later in pregnancy than was true in 1973, and advances in neonatal care have advanced viability to a point somewhat earlier. But these facts go only to the scheme of time limits on the realization of competing interests, and the divergences from the factual premises of 1973 have no bearing on the validity of Roe's central holding, that viability marks the earliest point at which the state's interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions.   The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs at approximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of Roe, at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some moment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future.  Whenever it may occur, the attainment of viability may continue to serve as the critical fact, just as it has done since Roe was decided; which is to say that no change in Roe's factual underpinning has left its central holding obsolete, and none supports an argument for overruling it.   The sum of the precedential inquiry to this point shows Roe's underpinnings unweakened in any way affecting its central holding.  While it has engendered disapproval, it has not been unworkable. An entire generation has come of age free to assume Roe's concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions; no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe's central holding a doctrinal remnant; Roe portends no developments at odds with other precedent for the analysis of personal liberty; and no changes of fact have rendered viability more or less appropriate as the point at which the balance of interests tips. . . .                    . . .         Our analysis would not be complete, however, without explaining why overruling Roe's central holding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under principles of stare decisis, but would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a nation dedicated to the rule of law. . . .    The root of American Governmental power is revealed most clearly in the instance of the power conferred by the Constitution upon the Judiciary of the United States and specifically upon this Court. As Americans of each succeeding generation are rightly told, the Court cannot buy support for its decisions by spending money and, except to a minor degree, it cannot independently coerce obedience to its decrees. The Court's power lies, rather, in its legitimacy, a product of substance and perception that shows itself in the people's acceptance of the judiciary as fit to determine what the nation's law means and to declare what it demands.   The underlying substance of this legitimacy is of course the warrant for the Court's decisions in the Constitution and the lesser sources of legal principle on which the Court draws. That substance is expressed in the Court's opinions, and our contemporary understanding is such that a decision without principled justification would be no judicial act at all. But even when justification is furnished by apposite legal principle, something more is required. Because not every conscientious claim of principled justification will be accepted as such, the justification claimed must be beyond dispute.   The Court must take care to speak and act in ways that allow people to accept its decisions on the terms the Court claims for them, as grounded truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures having, as such, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is obliged to make.  Thus, the Court's legitimacy depends on making legally principled decisions under circumstances in which their principled character is sufficiently plausible to be accepted by the nation.   The need for principled action to be perceived as such is implicated to some degree whenever this, or any other appellate court, overrules a prior case. This is not to say, of course, that this Court cannot give a perfectly satisfactory explanation in most cases.  People understand that some of the Constitution's language is hard to fathom and that the Court's Justices are sometimes able to perceive significant facts or to understand principles of law that eluded their predecessors and that justify departures from existing decisions. However upsetting it may be to those most directly affected when one judicially derived rule replaces another, the country can accept some correction of error without necessarily questioning the legitimacy of the Court.    In two circumstances, however, the Court would almost certainly fail to receive the benefit of the doubt in overruling prior cases.  There is, first, a point beyond which frequent overruling would overtax the country's belief in the Court's good faith. Despite the variety of reasons that may inform and justify a decision to overrule, we cannot forget that such a decision is usually perceived (and perceived correctly) as, at the least, a statement that a prior decision was wrong. There is a limit to the amount of error that can plausibly be imputed to prior courts. If that limit should be exceeded, disturbance of prior rulings would be taken as evidence that justifiable re-examination of principle had given way to drives for particular results in the short term. The legitimacy of the Court would fade with the frequency of its vacillation.   That first circumstance can be described as hypothetical; the second is to the point here and now. Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases, its decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.   The Court is not asked to do this very often, having thus addressed the nation only twice in our lifetime, in the decisions of Brown and Roe. But when the Court does act in this way, its decision requires an equally rare precedential force to counter the inevitable efforts to overturn it and to thwart its implementation. Some of those efforts may be mere unprincipled emotional reactions; others may proceed from principles worthy of profound respect.   But whatever the premises of opposition may be, only the most convincing justification under accepted standards of precedent could suffice to demonstrate that a later decision overruling the first was anything but a surrender to political pressure, and an unjustified repudiation of the principle on which the Court staked its authority in the first instance. So to overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to re-examine a watershed decision would subvert the Court's legitimacy beyond any serious question.                    . . .         The Court's duty in the present case is clear. In 1973, it confronted the already-divisive issue of governmental power to limit personal choice to undergo abortion, for which it provided a new resolution based on the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether or not a new social consensus is developing on that issue, its divisiveness is no less today than in 1973, and pressure to overrule the decision, like pressure to retain it, has grown only more intense. A decision to overrule Roe's essential holding under the existing circumstances would address error, if error there was, at the cost of both profound and unnecessary damage to the Court's legitimacy, and to the nation's commitment to the rule of law. It is therefore imperative to adhere to the essence of Roe's original decision, and we do so today.   From what we have said so far it follows that it is a constitutional liberty of the woman to have some freedom to terminate her pregnancy. We conclude that the basic decision in Roe was based on a constitutional analysis which we cannot now repudiate. The woman's liberty is not so unlimited, however, that from the outset the State cannot show its concern for the life of the unborn, and at a later point in fetal development the state's interest in life has sufficient force so that the right of the woman to terminate the pregnancy can be restricted.                    . . .         Yet it must be remembered that Roe v. Wade speaks with clarity in establishing not only the woman's liberty but also the state's \\"important and legitimate interest in potential life.\\" That portion of the decision in Roe has been given too little acknowledgement and implementation by the Court in its subsequent cases.   Those cases decided that any regulation touching upon the abortion decision must survive strict scrutiny, to be sustained only if drawn in narrow terms to further a compelling state interest. Not all of the cases decided under that formulation can be reconciled with the holding in Roe itself that the state has legitimate interests in the health of the woman and in protecting the potential life within her.   In resolving this tension, we choose to rely upon Roe, as against the later cases.                    . . .         Some guiding principles should emerge.  What is at stake is the woman's right to make the ultimate decision, not a right to be insulated from all others in doing so.   Regulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the state, or the parent or guardian of a minor, may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose. Unless it has that effect on her right of choice, a state measure designed to persuade her to choose childbirth over abortion will be upheld if reasonably related to that goal.   Regulations designed to foster the health of a woman seeking an abortion are valid if they do not constitute an undue burden. That is to be expected in the application of any legal standard which must accommodate life's complexity. We do not expect it to be otherwise with respect to the undue burden standard. We give this summary:   (a) To protect the central right recognized by Roe v. Wade while at the same time accommodating the state's profound interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden analysis as explained in this opinion.  An undue burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.   (b) We reject the rigid trimester framework of Roe v. Wade. To promote the state's profound interest in potential life, throughout pregnancy the state may take measures to ensure that the woman's choice is informed, and measures designed to advance this interest will not be invalidated as long as their purpose is to persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion. These measures must not be an undue burden on the right.   (c) As with any medical procedure, the state may enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion. Unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.   (d) Our adoption of the undue burden analysis does not disturb the central holding of Roe v. Wade, and we reaffirm that holding.  Regardless of whether exceptions are made for particular circumstances, a State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.   (e) We also reaffirm Roe's holding that \\"subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\\" Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 164 165. By Justice Stevens Concurring in part and dissenting in part   The portions of the Court's opinion that I have joined are more important than those with which I disagree. I shall therefore first comment on significant areas of agreement, and then explain the limited character of my disagreement.    The Court is unquestionably correct in concluding that the doctrine of stare decisis has controlling significance in a case of this kind, notwithstanding an individual justice's concerns about the merits. The central holding of Roe v. Wade, has been a \\"part of our law\\" for almost two decades. It was a natural sequel to the protection of individual liberty established in Griswold v. Connecticut, The societal costs of overruling Roe at this late date would be enormous. Roe is an integral part of a correct understanding of both the concept of liberty and the basic equality of men and women.                    . . .         I also accept what is implicit in the Court's analysis, namely, a reaffirmation of Roe's explanation of why the state's obligation to protect the life or health of the mother must take precedence over any duty to the unborn.  The Court in Roe carefully considered, and rejected, the state's argument \\"that the fetus is a 'person' within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\"   After analyzing the usage of \\"person\\" in the Constitution, the Court concluded that that word \\"has application only postnatally.\\" Commenting on the contingent property interests of the unborn that are generally represented by guardians ad litem, the Court noted: \\"Perfection of the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.\\" Accordingly, an abortion is not \\"the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.\\"   From this holding, there was no dissent, indeed, no member of the Court has ever questioned this fundamental proposition.  Thus, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, a developing organism that is not yet a \\"person\\" does not have what is sometimes described as a \\"right to life.\\" This has been and, by the Court's holding today, remains a fundamental premise of our constitutional law governing reproductive autonomy. By Justice Blackmun Concurring in part and dissenting in part    Three years ago, in Webster v. Reproductive Health Serv., four members of this Court appeared poised to \\"cas(t) into darkness the hopes and visions of every woman in this country\\" who had come to believe that the Constitution guaranteed her the right to reproductive choice. All that remained between the promise of Roe and the darkness of the plurality was a single, flickering flame. Decisions since Webster gave little reason to hope that this flame would cast much light. But now, just when so many expected the darkness to fall, the flame has grown bright.   I do not underestimate the significance of today's joint opinion. Yet I remain steadfast in my belief that the right to reproductive choice is entitled to the full protection afforded by this Court before Webster. And I fear for the darkness as four Justices anxiously await the single vote necessary to extinguish the light.   Make no mistake, the joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter is an act of personal courage and constitutional principle. In contrast to previous decisions in which Justices O'Connor and Kennedy postponed reconsideration of Roe v. Wade, the authors of the joint opinion today join Justice Stevens and me in concluding that \\"the essential holding of Roe should be retained and once again reaffirmed.\\"   In brief, five members of this Court today recognize that \\"the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages.\\" A fervent view of individual liberty and the force of stare decisis have led the Court to this conclusion.                    . . .         At long last, the Chief Justice admits it.  Gone are the contentions that the issue need not be (or has not been) considered. There, on the first page, for all to see, is what was expected: \\"We believe that Roe was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases.\\" If there is much reason to applaud the advances made by the joint opinion today, there is far more to fear from the Chief Justice's opinion.    The Chief Justice's criticism of Roe follows from his stunted conception of individual liberty. While recognizing that the Due Process Clause protects more than simple physical liberty, he then goes on to construe this Court's personal-liberty cases as establishing only a laundry list of particular rights, rather than a principled account of how these particular rights are grounded in a more general right of privacy.                    . . .         Under the Chief Justice's standard, states can ban abortion if that ban is rationally related to a legitimate state interest a standard which the United States calls \\"deferential, but not toothless.\\" Yet when pressed at oral argument to describe the teeth, the best protection that the Solicitor General could offer to women was that a prohibition, enforced by criminal penalties, with no exception for the life of the mother, \\"could raise very serious questions.\\" Perhaps, the Solicitor General offered, the failure to include an exemption for the life of the mother would be \\"arbitrary and capricious.\\"   If, as the Chief Justice contends, the undue burden test is made out of whole cloth, the so called \\"arbitrary and capricious\\" limit is the Solicitor General's \\"new clothes.\\"   Even if it is somehow \\"irrational\\" for a state to require a woman to risk her life for her child, what protection is offered for women who become pregnant through rape or incest? Is there anything arbitrary or capricious about a state's prohibiting the sins of the father from being visited upon his offspring?   But, we are reassured, there is always the protection of the democratic process. While there is much to be praised about our democracy, our country since its founding has recognized that there are certain fundamental liberties that are not to be left to the whims of an election. A woman's right to reproductive choice is one of those fundamental liberties.  Accordingly, that liberty need not seek refuge at the ballot box.    In one sense, the Court's approach is worlds apart from that of the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia. And yet, in another sense, the distance between the two approaches is short -- the distance is but a single vote. I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on this Court forever, and when I do step down, the confirmation process for my successor well may focus on the issue before us today. That, I regret, may be exactly where the choice between the two worlds will be made. FROM THE DISSENT By Chief Justice Rehnquist Dissenting in part and concurring in part     The joint opinion, following its newly-minted variation on stare decisis, retains the outer shell of Roe v. Wade, but beats a wholesale retreat from the substance of that case. We believe that Roe was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases.  We would adopt the approach of the plurality in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, and uphold the challenged provisions of the Pennsylvania statute in their entirety.                    . . .         The joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter cannot bring itself to say that Roe was correct as an original matter, but the authors are of the view that \\"the immediate question is not the soundness of Roe's resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that must be accorded to its holding.\\"   Instead of claiming that Roe was correct as a matter of original constitutional interpretation, the opinion therefore contains an elaborate discussion of stare decisis.                    . . .         In our view, authentic principles of stare decisis do not require that any portion of the reasoning in Roe be kept intact. \\"Stare decisis is not . . . a universal, inexorable command,\\" especially in cases involving the interpretation of the Federal Constitution. . . . Erroneous decisions in such constitutional cases are uniquely durable, because correction through legislative action, save for constitutional amendment, is impossible. It is therefore our duty to reconsider constitutional interpretations that \\"depar(t) from a proper understanding\\" of the Constitution.                    . . .         Our constitutional watch does not cease merely because we have spoken before on an issue; when it becomes clear that a prior constitutional interpretation is unsound we are obliged to reexamine the question.                    . . .         In the end, having failed to put forth any evidence to prove any true reliance, the joint opinion's argument is based solely on generalized assertions about the national psyche, on a belief that the people of this country have grown accustomed to the Roe decision over the last 19 years and have \\"ordered their thinking and living around\\" it. As an initial matter, one might inquire how the joint opinion can view the \\"central holding\\" of Roe as so deeply rooted in our constitutional culture, when it so casually uproots and disposes of that same decision's trimester framework.                    . . .         There is also a suggestion in the joint opinion that the propriety of overruling a \\"divisive\\" decision depends in part on whether \\"most people\\" would now agree that it should be overruled. Either the demise of opposition or its progression to substantial popular agreement apparently is required to allow the Court to reconsider a divisive decision. How such agreement would be ascertained, short of a public opinion poll, the joint opinion does not say.  But surely even the suggestion is totally at war with the idea of \\"legitimacy\\" in whose name it is invoked.   The Judicial Branch derives its legitimacy, not from following public opinion, but from deciding by its best lights whether legislative enactments of the popular branches of Government comport with the Constitution. The doctrine of stare decisis is an adjunct of this duty, and should be no more subject to the vagaries of public opinion than is the basic judicial task.    There are other reasons why the joint opinion's discussion of legitimacy is unconvincing as well. In assuming that the Court is perceived as \\"surrender(ing) to political pressure\\" when it overrules a controversial decision, the joint opinion forgets that there are two sides to any controversy. The joint opinion asserts that, in order to protect its legitimacy, the Court must refrain from overruling a controversial decision lest it be viewed as favoring those who oppose the decision. But a decision to adhere to prior precedent is subject to the same criticism, for in such a case one can easily argue that the Court is responding to those who have demonstrated in favor of the original decision.                      . . .       By Justice Scalia Dissenting in part and concurring in part    My views on this matter are unchanged from those I set forth in my separate opinions in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services and Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health. The states may, if they wish, permit abortion-on-demand, but the Constitution does not    require    them to do so.    The permissiblity of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting. As the Court acknowledges, \\"where reasonable people disagree the goverment can adopt one position or the other.\\"   The Court is correct in adding the qualification that this \\"assumes a state of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon a protected liberty,\\" but the crucial part of that qualification is the penultimate word. A State's choice between two positions on which reasonable people can disagree is constitutional even when (as is often the case) it intrudes upon a \\"liberty\\" in the absolute sense.    Laws against bigamy, for example -- which entire societies of reasonable people disagree with -- intrude upon men and women's liberty to marry and live with one another. But bigamy happens not to be a liberty specially \\"protected\\" by the Constitution.   That is, quite simply, the issue in this case: not whether the power of a woman to abort her unborn child is a \\"liberty\\" in the absolute sense; or even whether it is a liberty of great importance to many women. Of course it is both. The issue is whether it is a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States. I am sure it is not.    I reach that conclusion not because of anything so exalted as my views concerning the \\"concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of life.\\" Rather, I reach it for the same reason I reach the conclusion that bigamy is not constitutionally protected -- because of two simple facts: (1) the Constitution says absolutely nothing about it, and (2) the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed.                    . . .         The Court's description of the place of Roe in the social history of the United States is unrecognizable. Not only did Roe not, as the Court suggests,    resolve    the deeply divisive issue of abortion; it did more than anything else to nourish it, but elevating it to the national level where it is infinitely more difficult to resolve.

In the 1940's the Texas civic leader Alonso Perales pointedly questioned the War Department about why 50 percent to 75 percent of all South Texas casualties were Mexican-Texans, while they constituted 500,000 of the state's 6 million population.

Labalme, Henry G. Labalme, Lisa G. Osterland & Victoria A. Labalme, grandmother of six, and sister of Ann H. Poole, all of whom mourn her passing. A graduate of the Brearley School and Magna Cum Laude graduate of Bryn Mawr, she held an M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard, where she was awarded the Caroline A. Wilby prize for her doctoral dissertation as ''the best original work in any department.'' Among her many professional activities, Patricia Labalme was Associate Director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, (1982-1988) and Secretary of the Corporation (1982-1992). From 1992-1997, she was Assistant to the Director, Dr. Phillip A. Griffiths. Most recently, she was a Visitor in the School of Historical Studies, at the IAS. Known also for her dedication to independent school education, she was, among her many affiliations, president of the Brearley Board of Trustees (1978-1982). She was also a trustee of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation (1979Present), the American Academy in Rome (1979-1999), the first female trustee of the Lawrenceville School (1985-1996), and a trustee of the Renaissance Society of America (1982-Present). She was also a member of the Ateneo Veneto and the Istituto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, both in Venice, and Director of the Quantum Chemical Corporation. Her passion for humanism was formed by her lifelong friendships with professors Werner Jaeger, Myron P. Gilmore, Helen Maud Cam, Paul Oskar Kristeller, Vittore Branca and Felix Gilbert. It was Gilbert, her professor at Bryn Mawr and her colleague at the IAS, who, after three decades of encouragement, persuaded her to start her book on Marino Sanudo's diaries. At the time of her death, Dr. Labalme was close to completing this book, which received initial funding from the NEH. The book will be published posthumously under a unique arrangement in which the IAS has created a special position, a Director's Visitor, to be held by Professor Laura S. White, who will oversee the book's completion. A private service was held at the family home in West Cornwall, CT, on October 14. A memorial service will be held at the Marciana Library in Venice. In addition, a New York City memorial service will be held at the Brearley School at a later date to be announced. Contributions in lieu of flowers can be made to the Brearley School, attention: Alumnae Office, 610 East 83rd Street, New York, New York 10028, for the benefit of faculty salaries.   LABALME-Patricia Hochschild. The Brearley School deeply mourns the passing of a beloved member of our community. The School will be forever grateful to Dr. Labalme for her clear vision and leadership over more than six decades. A Brearley Alumna in the Class of 1944, the mother of three Brearley daughters, and a former member of the Brearley History Department, Dr. Labalme was a member of the Board of Trustees from 1975 to 1983, was Board President from 1978 to 1982, and continued as an Honorary Trustee until her death. She served the School with vitalizing energy and purpose in many capacities including Chairman of Special Gifts in The Capital Fund Program (1975-78), and Chair of Alumnae Giving in the Centennial Fund Campaign (1982-85). She was the recipient in 1987 of the Frances Riker Davis Award, the school's highest alumnae honor. Paraphrasing her own remarks to the Brearley community as Board President twenty years ago, we say to her: ''thank you for being there...for the vibrant, striving world you have helped to make and of which you were an essential part.''   LABALME - Patricia. The Rockefeller University community deeply mourns the passing of Patricia Hochschild Labalme, beloved wife of our friend George Labalme, Jr. Hers was a remarkable life, and she will be greatly missed.

This film is a merry specimen filled with nonsensical incidents, its complications and shrieking suspense being similar to the tactics adopted ??? Harold Lloyd's comedy, \\"The Freshman,\\" and Red Grange's football feature, \\"One Minute to Play.\\"To see a well-dressed, melancholy man fall into the water is unfailing in its appeal to spectators. This piece of reliable humor is tackled by William Austin in the rôle of Mr. Spangle, an absent-minded professor who is wont to indulge in such endearing terms as \\"Old Sardine\\" and \\"Old Smelt\\" when addressing, through the subtitles, Gertrude Ederle, who, in character, saved this gentleman from a watery grave. His exclamations are also varied and colorful. It is he who endeavors to resuscitate Alice Smith, but unfortunately (or fortunately, considering the mirth it aroused) gets hold of a bottle of chloroform instead of ammonia.\\"Sweet spirits in pink girdles,\\" is the ejaculation of a Dana College girl when she believes that none other than Alice Smith has won the swimming race. In these early episodes Alice's stroke is suitable to neither distance nor speed. She is an exceptionally awkward swimmer, but in the closing chapters, after Miss Ederle has coached her, she shows a startling improvement. In fact, it is the much-abused Alice who captures the laurels for Dana and is the toast of the day.In such a yarn nothing can go smoothly. There must be a last minute dash for the starting place of the aquatic sports just as there was always in the old-time film stories of race horses. Here Alice is discovered at the eleventh hour to be twenty miles away, brooding over her failure in a former swimming race which she honestly thought she had won. Jerry Marvin, her devoted admirer, and Mr. Spangle dash off to enlist her support in upholding the honors for Dana College.

From the deck of the ferry or speedboat, patterns of islands change kaleidoscopically, now linking together to form a single serrated island, now standing apart as if to allow fishing boats and tankers to pass. If you are lucky with the weather, the brilliant green of the islands is set off by the sparkling blue of the sea and the softer blue of the sky, but even if it is raining, the varied shapes of the islands, dimly visible through the mist, claim your entire attention.   The Inland Sea is usually calm, more like a lake than a sea, because it is all but encircled by the main islands - Honshu to the north, and Shikoku and Kyushu to the south and west. The view is so entrancing that it's easy to forget that this is not simply a magnificent tourist attraction, but a much-used waterway dotted with entirely businesslike ships of many sizes and nationalities.

This Victor Jallot at least proves that he has something else to do beyond carrying the heroine across a muddy road and humbling men proud of their skill with the sword. He is actually seen giving lessons. His exploits with the flashing weapons include disarming a muscular braggart and bringing ridicule upon a young snob, who had never for an instant imagined that the man he thought to be a barber could handle a sword more expertly than he could a razor. Master Jallot has the temerity to clip off necessary buttons from this young upstart's clothes.George Fitzmaurice appears to have undertaken a study that did not particularly interest him, for the result of his direction in \\"The Love Mart\\" is hardly imaginative and few persons will find that its humor is even as keen as the clumsy sword of one of its brigands. In one way and another the plot is telegraphed to the average mind. Therefore, although that greedy, overbearing rascal, Captain Remy (Noah Beery) succeeds in having Antoinette Frobelle sold as an octoroon slave, the poor girl's plight never seems as if it were to be a lasting one. In the first place, Captain Remy's word is taken much too easily by all the other characters and Antoinette bows her head and submits to the indignities of Remy and a few fops.In the course of one of his duels Jallot wagers $50 against a rogue's alleged fencing school and $1 on a duel. He insisted on the $1 because he and his servant, Poupet, had spent their last nickel. The fencing school is won by Jallot with consummate ease, but it turns out to be a dilapidated barber's shop, which inspires the idea that Jallot is a barber. Through the razor, however, and not by the sword, Jallot forces the truth from the miscreant Remy.Noah Beery is not especially impressive in this tedious picture. He seems to be bent on giving exhibitions of his flexible physiognomy. Billie Dove is pretty in her poses, but she does not accomplish a great deal that could be construed as acting.

As great literature reminds us (for example, \\"Fanny Hill\\"), frigid females are often moved to men after being aroused by women","excerpt":"but who ever heard of a man preferring girls once he has found the boy of his dreams?Monique is an elderly French \\"au pair\\" girl who comes to live with an unhappily married young English couple, to cook, to care for their children and generally to spruce up their lives.From the first she proves a real find, with the kids and in the kitchen, but only after she completely satisfies the frustrated husband and then, on a Christmas Eve, brings the icy wife to a slow omnisexual simmer that lasts through the rest of the movie, does she fully demonstrate the meaning of \\"service.\\" Such satisfactions and transformations are always pleasant to contemplate, and though never very exciting, \\"Monique\\" is heroically pleasant.Basically domestic comedy with a little nudity (very little) and a little sex (generally indicated by a woman rolling her head from side to side on the pillow and gasping a bit at the end), \\"Monique\\" explores such problems as how to wash, dry and play with youngsters, what to serve for dinner and how to trim the Christmas tree. I tried very hard to find all this suggestive, but I couldn't. And Monique herself, a kind of skin-flick Mary Poppins who smiles all the time and speaks good thoughts, doesn't help.Neither Sibylla Kay as Monique nor Joan Alcorn as the wife is likely to disturb your sleep, but Miss Alcorn has sensible British good looks, and just from the facial expressions she manages not to make, I think she might be fun to watch in a real movie.This movie, on the other hand, though never embarrassingly inept, is simply not sufficiently interesting. Much of its most libidinous action takes place behind tactfully closed doors (one brief scene, I swear, looks like lower-middle-class imitation Lubitsch), and all the rest, safely within the limits of the most timid assays upon the genre.

SO much has been and is still being written about Voltaire that his own works are probably less often read than are the books discussing them. Lytton Strachey, whom A. J. Ayer is fond of quoting, remarked about Voltaire more than 80 years ago: ''Everyone, it is true, has heard of him","excerpt":"but who has read him? It is by his name that ye shall know him, and not by his works.'' It would therefore be unreasonable to expect that this rather short essay by a nonspecialist, and intended for a nonspecialized audience, should add much to what has already been said many times about Voltaire and his works. Nor can the book claim much originality for having been written by an Englishman, since Voltaire's well-known indebtedness to England has been more than amply repaid by England's disproportionately large contribution to Voltaire scholarship. Much more is yet to come.

Only in one of two places was Mr. Tibbett's singing too overwhelming for the powers of the microphone, which, however, is something that can be remedied from the projection booth in forthcoming performances.When Mr. Tibbett sings, one cares not why, for the story, such as it is, takes second place in this film. The comedy of that clever team, Stanley Laurel and Oliver Hardy, may slip from quiet fun to slapstick, but, so long as you know that soon again Mr. Tibbett's stentorian singing is to be heard, one laughs with the crowd. And so also during the commonplace passages of dialogues one is well aware that it will not be long before Mr. Tibbett is to sing again. And when his voice swells from the screen one forgets not only the trite lines and the farcical antics, but also that the singer himself is not on the stage. Never before have a singer's efforts on the screen been applauded so genuinely.He has a sheikish air with him, has this opera singer. He fills his part well, and beauty is impersonated by Catherine Dale Owen, whose charms suffice for any picture. It is not a film to criticize adversely the excuse for a story, for to be able to listen to Mr. Tibbett sing is ample reward for sitting in one's seat. It is, moreover, an audible picture in which the vocal sounds are finely synchronized. Mr. Tibbett is virtually the only one who sings, and as he happens to be a bandit in this film and one who sings as he is being lashed in the end, one becomes quite satisfied with his heroism. He is like a singing Fairbanks, who does not attempt Mr. Fairbanks's sleight of foot.As Yegor, the Caucasian singing bandit, who garbs himself as a Cossack, Mr. Tibbett avails himself of any opportunity to rend the air with his melodious baritone voice. Sometimes he chants of love, then of beauty, then of hate and also of hoped-for revenge. Near a lake he sits with Princess Vera (Miss Owen) and warbles about \\"eight little fingers and two little thumbs.\\" At that instant he is in a conciliatory mood, for he has captured the Princess after throttling her brother. He ends the life of Vera's brother because that rascal had deceived his (Yegor's) sister.Yegor's clan are known as the \\"robbing larks,\\" but Yegor is given a chance to show that all women are not tempting to him. For instance, there is the Princess Alexandra, who finds Yegor so pleasing that without a word she offers him a string of pearls. He takes the pearls and leaves the matronly brunette in peace, much to her chagrin. She is, in fact, so peeved with Yegor's conduct that she wishes to have him apprehended for stealing her jewels","excerpt":"but Yegor, until the climax, is a difficult fellow even for the Cossacks to capture. He may be attired in red or blue and he may sing of his joy or his anguish, but those who desire Yegor's end are invariably discovered with a dagger in their own bosoms.There are scenes of the Thieves Market, others of palaces with highly polished floors. And from there one may go to grottoes, to mountainsides and through the chastening sands of a desert. They are all beautifully pictured in glowing Technicolor shades. On all sides one heard the audience remarking on the enchanting views before them.During those interludes when Mr. Tibbett lifted his powerful voice in song the audience sat in wrapt admiration and when his melody ended there was applause. A second later Messrs. Laurel and Hardy were perceived delivering some of their comic antics, now and again begining with a hush and a sense of restraint, but frequently culminating farcically, which provoked a wave of merriment.Among the songs rendered by Mr. Tibbett in this offering are \\"The Rogue Song,\\" \\"The Narrative\\" and \\"When I'm Looking For You.\\" The music of these renditions was composed by Herbert Stothart and the lyrics by Clifford Grey.Lionel Barrymore directed this subject, and considering its operatic action and scenic effects, he has done his task with good taste and imagination.The excuse for ballet interludes is that of having the performances held in Princess Alexandra's handsome home. There are scenes with dancers directed by Albertina Rasch, but in this production it is emphatically the voice that shines over settings and story, and the voice is that of Mr. Tibbett.

The man who delivered it was a chaplain in the United States Army, and he read these words:   ''When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, 'Is it you, you troubler of Israel?' And he answered, 'I have not troubled Israel","excerpt":"but you have, and your father's house, because you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and followed Baal's.' ''   Maj. Donald E. Overton said he was simply reminding his colleagues here at the Army Chaplain Center and School that their mission was to bring the message of faith to the troops. But the reading - which came at the regular morning service at the school's Protestant chapel - was really more than a call to the brotherhood of clerics. It was a parable of the conflict that in recent times has troubled the chaplaincy itself. ARMY CHAPLAINS STRUGGLE IN SERVICE OF TWO MASTERS"},{"year":"1939","title":"It begins to look as though the Drummond-Clavering nuptials never will come off. \\"Arrest Bulldog Drummond,\\" which came to the Criterion yesterday, finds the redoubtable Captain Hugh on his way to his bachelor dinner again (this is either his sixth or seventh start), while the patient Phyllis fondly admonishes him not to get mixed up in any more murder cases until after high noon of the morrow. An incurable optimist is Phyllis, doomed to go through life with a trousseau in one hand, a death threat in the other and only the faintest trace of worry wrinkles around the eyes. It's astonishing, the way she bears up under all this frustration.Hugh goes out into the night, impeccably white-tied, and runs smack into an atomic disintegrator or something perfected by a chap who calls himself \\"The Earl of Destiny.\\" It's a bifocal gadget guaranteed to detonate any explosives within range of half a mile. Just press the switch, synchronize the rays on the combustibles and bang! The Earl of Destiny was a pacifist who intended to disarm the world","excerpt":"but you know how these international spies get around. With the machine in their pow-errr, and Phyllis in their clutches, and good old Algy and the man-servant Tenny strung up over a pit of quicklime, and the Bulldog pedaling frantically to the rescue on his bicycle—Is the suspense killing you, too?Like all the other \\"Bulldog\\" adventures, this one is quite a lark, especially if you've a mind to boo the hero and cheer the villains. John Howard's debonair Captain Drummond is as imperishable as ever, Heather Angel's Phyllis is the most resourceful of heroines (she even swims half a mile and never gets her suit wet), George Zucco is the most hissable man in thick—lensed spectacles, and Reginald Denny and E. E. Clive positively glow in the hot water comically kept boiling for Algy and Tenny. We still are offering 10 to 1 that the Bulldog won't reach the altar by 1940. Any takers?At the Roosevelt TheatreThat Soviet picture-makers should relax occasionally from the serious business of producing historical and propaganda films and grind out a few \\"Westerns\\" and the like is quite understandable. But just why any of these minor efforts should be exported, especially to the country where their type originated, seems incomprehensible, unless it is hoped that their rental may bring welcome foreign exchange into the Russian treasury.An outstanding example of these Soviet celluloid melodramas is at the Roosevelt Theatre in East Houston Street. Based on Jules Verne's \\"Captain Grant's Children,\\" a fantastic tale popular on the stage in America half a century ago, and played by a cast embracing such able artists as Nikolai Cherkassof, I. Chuvelef and Y. Yurief, this story of high adventure on land and sea in the Eighteen Sixties is likely to amuse the spectators in more ways than V. Weinstock and D. Gutman, the directors, counted upon. It is a Mosfilm production with English titles. THE SCREEN; A Wild-Eyed Thriller Is 'Arrest Bulldog Drummond,' at the Criterion--'Captain Grant's Children'"},{"year":"1936","title":"\\"Itto,\\" the new importation at the Cinema de Paris, contributes more to the cause of French imperialism than it does to that of entertainment. Essentially a complacent story of France's conquest of Morocco, the picture is the victim of indirection and uncertain editing. It has a wealth of material—the magnificent natural background of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco, the native Berber and Chleuh tribesmen for human \\"atmosphere\\" and the inherently dramatic story of a people's struggle for freedom. Yet, with all these natural values for a heroic photoplay, the film's producers still thought it necessary to call out the reserves of love interest and fictional melodrama.Thus, the issue of \\"Itto\\" is not whether the French tricolor shall fly serenely over the Moroccan hills but whether the rebellious chieftain's daughter shall continue to live with another chieftain's son who has joined the French. Again, the answer to France's bid for victory is not determined by the crushing defeat of the tribesmen in battle, but when the native women crawl through the snow-covered hills, dragging behind them the medicine chests containing the diphtheria serum which alone can save the life of the French doctor's baby. This seems to be a fairly roundabout way to achieve victory over the Berbers, not to mention its lack of conviction.What makes \\"Itto's\\" meanderings all the more difficult to understand is the fact that the picture was directed by Marie Epstein and Jean Benoit-Levy, who created the exceptionally fine French film, \\"La Maternelle.\\" The inference is that M. Benoit-Levy is more adept at miniatures than at large-scale murals which seek to encompass the whole range of tribal life, French dominion, the advancing frontiers of medical science and the wild hills of rugged Morocco.Scattered, unhappily, at too-distan intervals through the film are some brilliant episodes and photographic studies which make one regret all the more that \\"Itto\\" was not what it might have been. For comedy there is a priceless bit in which a Chleuh seeks to protect himself against all ills by sampling each vial in the doctor's drug kit.For dignity there is the stern rebel chief, Moulay Ibrahim, who looks like a descendant of kings. For general interest, even against the annoyances of artificial plot, is the film's quality as a documentary record of life in Morocco. Superimposed titles in English compensate fully for the babel of French, Berber and Chleuh.

Such constancy deserves particular admiration in light of the pressures brought about by the restaurant's increased popularity.   Marie Damiano, the owner, has put a polish to the dining rooms not only in the softly glowing brass accent of candlesticks, fire screen and dazzling espresso machine, but also in the crispness and sparkle of the table appointments. Polished, too, is professional interplay between the kitchen's creative chef, Nicola Brunetti, and the knowledgeable maitre d'hotel, Marcello Sili.

Stumbling around in checked shirts and chaps, the boys cut through some hilarious scenes","excerpt":"but, as in their previous adventures, the footage is padded with the most dreadful drivel about a fake cowboy who sings some moon-struck ditties and finally wins the rodeo prize after all.The idea, of course, is to scare Costello. Suspend him from the roof of a boxcar while a herd of longhorns buffet the lowest part of his anatomy. Let him bleat with terror when, by mistake, he finds himself in the saddle of the wildest bronc in the corral or when he is drubbed by a high-diving board in the ranch pool.

B y tradition, violinists are partial to displays of daredevil virtuosity - possibly because of their instrument's inherent intractability: Where pianists can weave contrapuntal webs, or draw on dense harmonies with comparative ease, violinists are stuck with a basically monodic instrument that can be made to seem convincingly polyphonic only with the greatest of effort - and the most secure technique. These days, technical virtuosity is commonplace, particularly among young players. But several have come upon a new way to test their virtuosic mettle: Amid the latest violin disks, most of which are conventional studio productions, there are several recordings of live performances, issues without cosmetic editing.   There are some advantages to this approach. Most notably, these unedited recordings convey an accurate and unhindered representation of a performer's concept. They also leave the performer's technical abilities open to close scrutiny. When the performance is near-flawless, the results can be electrifying","excerpt":"but, as many listeners learned during the ''direct-to- disk'' fad that hit the audiophile market a few years back, flaws-and-all performances can become increasingly irritating when a disk is played frequently.

That's not just because he's a theatrical agent, 57 years old, with no previous experience of production. It's not just because the idea of restaging a bouncy 30's British musical was thought absurdly risky by most of the leading British impresarios. It's not even just because there wasn't so much as a proper script of the show in existence when the work of revival began.   No, the reason it's special is more personal, more private than that.   The composer of ''Me and My Girl'' was Noel Gay. Noel Gay's offstage name was Reginald Armitage. Reginald Armitage, who died in 1954, was Richard Armitage's father. And rarely can a son have struggled harder, more single-mindedly and against tougher odds to reestablish a father's reputation than has Richard Armitage these past few years. It's a combination of filial faith and professional judgment that has paid off handsomely in London, where his production of ''Me and My Girl'' has so far run more than 600 performances","excerpt":"but, as Mr. Armitage well knows, Broadway is the world's capital of musical theater and provides the show with its severest test to date.

Vachon (1914-75), who had been part of a distinguished photographic team working for the Farm Security Administration in  the 1930's, did not much relish doing official publicity shots, and most of the pictures he took in Poland were put away in archives without being published","excerpt":"but, as they are collected in POLAND, 1946: The Photographs and Letters of John Vachon (Smithsonian Institution, $39.95), they bring back, with  a startling poignancy, a time that for most of us is a forgotten historical zone. In Poland, perhaps more than in most of Europe, the war didn't really finish with its official end; and in his trips across the country, Vachon everywhere found the evidence of a continuing battle for survival, of massive social rearrangement and of still-seething political conflicts. Cities in rubble, children with rickets, villages burned to cinders by underground units fighting the newest Soviet domination, inhabitants of formerly German cities being deported, repatriates from Eastern territories being transported in filthy boxcars: this could be a terribly depressing record -- and yet, oddly, it isn't. In his letters to his wife, Vachon, despite his political naivete, wrote with great understanding not only about the hardships he witnessed, but also about the courage and dignity of the people he encountered -- and his images convey this fundamental sympathy. In the many faces of strangely grown-up children, in  the eyes of repatriates looking up with stubborn gravity, in the haunting melancholy of lone figures among ruins, in a family of peasants against a moody  rural landscape or a row of women salvaging bricks from a crumbled building, Vachon repeatedly caught both the pain of what had happened and the sense of fierce life reasserting itself. These impressionistic and somberly beautiful photographs constitute a deeply affecting portrait of a place and a people struggling to emerge from a terrible war into an uneasy peace.

It is not amazing, it is nothing new and never done before, it is not as original, even, as many undoubtedly expected, but it is a steadily enjoyable, genuine chip of boy life as it has been, is and forever will be lived in an antagonistic, man-ordered world.Edgar is just a boy, \\"neither the worst nor the best boy in town,\\" and the things he does and thinks form the substance of the picture. His actual life, for the most part, is a troublesome and exasperating business, but the life of his imagination is glorious. The triumph he achieves, his sweet revenge on the beautiful woman who scorns him, his impressionistic images of the people about him are all parts of a full and free existence in which neither parents nor teacher, duties nor commands, can interfere. It is Edgar's own life, ordered or disordered according to his will or whim. It is perfect while it lasts—but it cannot last. That is its tragedy. In his own world Edgar can humble and punish the vain woman who makes faces at him, but, called back to the world of fact by an unsympathetic teacher, he is powerless to execute revenge except by making faces himself, which is not very satisfying to one who knows the refinements and completeness of revenge as it may be accomplished in the realm of imperial imagination.It is this contrast between the real and fancied worlds of a boy's life, with the pertinent details and distinctions of each clear cut, that is presented in \\"Edgar and the Teacher's Pet\\"—which, one may remark, does not indicate that the picture is anything extraordinary, but this is to say only that the subject is not new, and he who insists constantly upon novelty of plot and story as of prime importance in a narrative simply encourages artificiality, bizarrerie and all of the excesses of which farfetched fiction is capable. It is treatment, not plot or subject, that is of prime importance. The oldest of old stories has in its favor the presumption of faithfulness to life and can be made new and refreshing by the treatment of words or moving pictures that reveal new truth in it or old truth from a new point of view. The charm of \\"Edgar and the Teacher's Pet\\" lies in the treatment of its subject. This, it must be said, is not all that might be desired, probably not all that Mr. Tarkington's script intended","excerpt":"but, despite certain deficiencies, which are relatively minor and not sufficiently disturbing to require specification, the picture as it stands is adequate and frequently illuminating. First of all, it is excellently acted. No better person than young Johnny Jones, it seems, could have been found for the part of Edgar, and the others in the cast, children and adults, are fit company for him. The scenes, as a whole, are well-made moving pictures, not too simple, nor yet involved with extraneous details. E. Mason Hopper, who directed the production, apparently was a fortunate selection.Furthermore, there are many subtle touches in the picture for which Mr. Tarkington himself must have been primarily responsible. For example, when Edgar, supreme in his own world, becomes the hero of the hour, the central personage of an important parade and the idol of applauding bystanders, does he appear in the plain garb of a general or the conventional attire of, say, a Cabinet Secretary, as the usual adult mind might conceive him? Not at all. He marches in the very van of the parade, immediately at the head of the band, a splendid and omnipotent drum major. And besides himself, the only conspicuous feature of the procession is the band, which any boy will say is the single essential of any parade, except, perhaps, that on circus day.Edgar's life is to be continued under the general title of \\"The Adventures and Emotions of Edgar Pomeroy,\\" and this first chapter, more than fulfilling the promise made for it, is a promise of delightful chapters to come.THE movie-minded should like \\"The Virgin of Stamboul,\\" which came to B. S. Moss's Broadway last week for an indefinite run.Those who like their movies in unmitigated melodramatic reels, with electrified heroes, heroines, villains and their variously assorted associates speeding through scene after scene of \\"action,\\" not bothered by logic nor any necessity for being lifelike, should find much to entertain them in this product of the motion-picture mill. It is the old wine of the long-familiar Western poured into a new bottle of Eastern setting. Its characters race against each other with all of the thrills that may be derived from a race of the wooden horses in Steeplechase Park, which go at high speed along fixed grooves to a predetermined result.Accepting \\"The Virgin of Stamboul\\" for what it is, one must admit its excellence. Tod Browning, who directed it, seems to have put into it everything that could be crowded into an impossible story and to have included nothing that could put his plot or people under any part of the hampering burden of being true to life. Priscilla Dean is such a virgin of such a Stamboul as one might imagine—and come upon in no other way. Wallace Beery, as Achmet Bey, who keeps a harem, murders a man who alienates the affections of his favorite wife, and then takes a terrible Turk's fancy to the virgin beggar-girl, is at his villainous best, and Wheeler Oakman, the stalwart American who loves the maid of Stamboul, is a movie hero after a movie heroine's heart. They are well picked and play well according to their several parts.The picture includes many striking scenes. The desert, of course, is used to good effect, and the fights, especially the final battle between villain and hero, are stirringly, if stagily, presented. There are many street and shop scenes that give the story the required \\"atmosphere,\\" and the costuming and general setting are elaborate.The artificialities of the story are so apparent, its effort to thrill so evident, its plot so plainly ordered, its characters so illogical and unreal, that, with many spectators, all of the talent, time and money spent on it will count as so much wasted material. To them \\"The Virgin of Stamboul\\" will be dull, because it lacks the vitality that only plausibility, verisimilitude, genuineness, can give—but there are others who ask only for \\"action,\\" tempestuous, picturesque, romantic action, and these undoubtedly will find the melodrama tabasco to their taste.

The early sequences, during which the director takes rather a long time to establish his characters and their peculiarities, are a bit slow, but as the film progresses Miss Tobin, as the designing if innocent-appearing rival, grows more and more interesting and carries off her lines and actions exceedingly well.Rose Hobart, as the wife who refuses to listen to her husband's excuses and who chooses to think the worst of him in his relations with the other woman, is another new person on the screen and succeeds in giving an intelligent and at all times restrained performance. She goes off to Europe alone. She is deserted by a man she meets on board ship when he learns that she will not, as she originally intended, give her husband a divorce. In the meantime the husband at home has fallen in love with the rival and, believing that his wife has obtained a divorce decree, he marries again.The resulting situation is solved with the wife's decision to surrender and leave the other two, but not until her rival has attempted suicide in order to permit the man to return to his first wife.The photoplay is not too skillfully assembled and could be cut to advantage.

NEW GLIMPSES INTO THE PAST"},{"year":"1926","title":"Ever since Joseph Plunkett, managing director of the Mark Strand, set the fashion. In August, 1925, for midnight presentations by offering at that hour Charlie Chaplin's comedy, \\"The Gold Rush,\\" other producers and theatre managers have occasionally emulated his example. The most recent of these witching-hour exhibitions took place at the Rialto, a few minutes after the clock struck twelve yesterday morning. The production thus honored was \\"Tin Gods,\\" the picturization of William Anthony McGuire's play of that name, and the most serious film subject to which Thomas Meighan has lent his stalwart presence for some time.This picture has the advantage of some thoroughly conscientious and capable acting on the part of the principals, and the vehicle itself possesses distinction during several of its New York and South American episodes. It is a question, however, whether the leading male role was suited to Mr. Meighan, who has a habit of keeping a check rein constantly on his emotions, a quality which in the ordinary run of pictorial features is not without merit","excerpt":"but, in this particular adventure, Mr. Meighan had the opportunity to impress the audience, whether by his affection for a South American dancer or a display of anger at his wife's selfishness. It is curious that this was not thought necessary by Allan Dwan, the director of this photoplay, who perhaps may be excused on the ground of having interpreted the character of Roger Drake as a strangely unemotional person. But dealing with ordinary human psychology one expects an outburst from Drake following at least two of the dramatic junctures of this picture.The incidents that bring about love and the way in which Drake is made to speak to give the girl her reason for commiting suicide, are both artificial and strained. One can imagine Drake, after leaving his wife because of her self-centred political aspirations, falling in love with Carita, because she looks after him when he is quarantined with black fever. But apparently all that caused Carita to be interested in Drake before that point was because he, when leaning over a bar intoxicated, gave Carita a dollar and she was able a minute later by a turn of the roulette wheel to increase it to $35.Whether the play or the pictorial script is responsible for Carita's sudden decision to throw herself from the bridge that Drake has constructed does not matter, for, as it is set forth on the screen, Carita at least impresses one as being the type of a girl who would not give in just because of one sentence she overheard Drake say to his wife. From the way in which she taunted Tony, the keeper of the gambling and drinking place, one would expect Carita to put a knife in Drake rather than put an end to her own life.Drake's little boy in an early chapter is killed by a fall from a window, after a careless nurse, more interested in Mrs. Drake's political chances than the child, had locked the door of the room. The feeling and the passion that should have been depicted following this tragedy is largely covered by a subtitle.Aileen Pringle gives an excellent portrayal of the selfish and inhuman Mrs. Drake. Renee Adorée shines from the instant her presence is flashed upon the screen. She impersonates Carita, and her bickering and recrimination with Tony afford much interest. William Powell's characterization of Tony leaves nothing wanting.

That's enough for most people. Those who stand apart from the crowd may talk of Mr. Chaplin's \\"art,\\" and those who stop to measure one thing by another may put his latest comedy beside \\"Shoulder Arms\\" and \\"The Kid\\" and tell you how far short it falls of the while set by these classics","excerpt":"but, meanwhile, they are showing \\"The Pilgrim\\" eight times a day, and eight times a day the crowd will laugh at it.And not from habit, either. If Chaplin had never made another comedy. If he had never been heard of before, \\"The Pilgrim\\" would be a hit. That's the test, and no one can doubt, surely, that \\"The Pilgrim\\" meets it.No, this picture is not the equal of \\"The Kid.\\" It lacks that comedy's subtleties, it isn't as sharply pointed with humanity, it isn't as finely characterized, but it's a genuine Chaplin, nevertheless. It has subtleties of its own, it is human in flashes and its characters are a good deal more than stage clowns. Furthermore, if it is broader than \\"The Kid,\\" it is also more direct as a burlesque. It has its own field. It is neither aimless buffoonery nor an imitation. And this is to Chaplin's credit. He has not copied himself nor has be played low to the mob with haphazard slapstick. He has aimed at something in his new work and hit it.The object of his jesting is Main Street, small-town life, the small-town congregation, little people who look large to themselves—and are afraid to have any fun. And what fun Chaplin has with them! He isn't vicious, his ridicule is general rather than specific, and it does not seem likely that any one will be offended by his mockery—except, of course, those who are too much like the people in the picture to enjoy its ji???es. It's a rare man, you know, who can look into a mirror and laugh. But, though good natured, the fun is pointed with an idea and it does hit something. When you see Chaplin as an escaped convict masquerading in a preacher's clothes, delivering a most earnest sermon at a hard-shelled congregation, familiar scenes are recolored for you, and when, at the end of the performance, a boy in the audience begins to applaud enthusiastically you feel the unconventional appropriateness of the preacher's smiling bows as he takes the curtain call. It is a darned good sermon, too.Chaplin passes through the town. For a day and a half he is accepted as its new parson, and then a kind-hearted Sheriff leaves him straddling the international boundary line between the United States and Mexico, with the dangerous lawlessness of the latter counry to the right and the dangerous law of the former to the left. He must choose between them—but before he is driven to either terrifying alternative the picture mercifully fades out, with the meek little clerical convict still astride the boundary line. It's a neat ending—and, incidentally, a good beginning for another comic tragedy.What goes on in the town while Chaplin is there forms, of course, the main part of the comedy, but it would dull the edge of it to supply details here. Pure farce, pointed satire, sentimental touches and bounding horseplay are mixed up together, all, as the saying goes, for your delight. And the peculiar joy of the picture is that it is a motion picture. It's what happens in the scenes that makes the story: it is the expressiveness of the pictures, and most of all of Chaplin's own exclusive pantomime, that gives \\"The Pilgrim\\" and all its predecessors a true cinematographic character of their own. And to those who believe that a motion picture above all things should be a composition of pictures that move and mean something, this is the film's most important and significant recommendation—and the chief reason why the Chaplin comedies are so popular, whether those who laugh at them know it or not.Also on the varied and evenly excellent bill at the Strand is one of those skillful Bray cartoon comedies, \\"Colonel Heeza Liar, Detective\\"; an interesting split reel called \\"Odds and Ends,\\" a Prizma color work, \\"I Know a Garden,\\" and \\"Robert Louis Stevenson,\\" a Kineto picture.Shakespeare on the screen, of course is not Shakespeare. He who goes to see an adaptation of one of the poet's works is certain to be disappointed. But Shakespeare's plays were built on solid stories, and it is possible for a producer to take one of these stories and from it fashion a photoplay that will stand on its own feet as screen entertainment.And this is what the Russian director, Dimitri Buchowetzki, has done with the German film \\"Othello,\\" which began a two weeks' engagement at the Criterlon Theatre yesterday afternoon. With Emil Jannings—the Jannings of Louis XV., Henry VIII., Pharaoh and Danton, you must remember—as the Moor, and Werner Kraus—Caligari and Robespierre, you know, as Iago, he has told a stirring story of simplicity, courage, honesty, villainy and revenge which rises by many degrees of excellence above the usual offering of the screen. It has vitality, it is direct and true, it is a thing of action. It's a full-blooded motion picture.Jannings's performance as Othello is an impressive piece of work. He makes you feel the genuine character of the Moor, his simplicity, his strength and his weakness. He gives you the man himself—and that's something to have from a performance, isn't it?Werner Kraus's Iago will probably strike different people differently. Some will like the character, while others will think the part overplayed and dissipated in too much jumping about, grimacing and gesticulating. It all depends on the Iago you want. If you can conceive of this Italian villain not only as emphatically Italian, but as a traditional Italian of the Middle Ages, you will not think that Kraus goes too far. You will feel, rather, that he stamps his rôle realistically, and also puts himself in effective contrast with Othello. And certainly he is vital and clearly understandable at all times—and this is an asset in any screen performance.The acting of the photoplay, as a whole, is distinctive. These Europeans do make themselves mean something. They do not just pose and promenade. They act. And even if their style is different, even if they sometimes seem to exaggerate, the spectator usually forgets the difference, and fails to note the exaggeration as he is carried along by the sweep and the significance of motions, of expressions, of gestures, of postures that reveal the people he is supposed to be looking in upon.The settings of the picture also play a dynamic part in the story, and the crowds, and the composition of the scenes. They are all in, and not on, the photoplay. Which means that Dimitri Buchowetzki, the director, has assembled and handled his plentiful material effectively. He has made it serve a common purpose—the telling of a stirring story, nothing less and all of that. You can find fault with the continuity; the photography is not always perfect, and it is doubtful whether the story of Othello will arouse the sympathy of everybody; but when this is said, this picture at the Criterion remains a forceful work and one sure to commend the interest and the admiration of many.Also on the program is an amusing \\"Out-of-the-Inkwell\\" cartoon by Max Fleischer??? a tempting scenic of the Riviera, and a diverting animal picture from the Bray studios.Other Films.Cecil B.

Not having had the chance, before, to use this telescope, Aelita is curious as to why the youth, of the earth should enjoy putting their lips and the lips of their noses together. She tries a kiss, without knowing what it is, with a Martian beau, but it means little or nothing to Aelita. There is an absence of sex-appeal on Mars, for, according to this \\"fragment\\" of the original production, that planet is inhabited chiefly by box-headed robots, who, in the last scenes, decide to have an insurrection of their own.This film is far more interesting to read about than to gaze upon. The producers had quite a good if a none too fresh idea, but it is worked out with a certain apathy, possibly because the Russians did not detect an opportunity to spread a little propaganda. The very passages that one conjures up in one's imagination are not in the film. Instead there are many scenes with queer settings and Martians sparsely costumed in spiked hats and celluloid or metal garments.The man from the earth, a young inventor, decides, like Jules Verne's hero, to go on a long air trip, but instead of traveling to the moon, this scientist whizzes up to Mars. In a hardy effort to elicit a little laughter, the scientist is accompanied by two unfunny stowaways. A tiny flash of light and it isn't long before the earth's centre of gravity no longer effects the scientist, and he keeps on and on until he plunges somewhat unceremoniously into Mars's background, apparently somewhere near the background of Aclita's robot-made palace.There are weird stairways, which look as if they were made of thin wood or cardboard, and the tinting of the film destroys what depth there might be to the very ordinary photography. The film is short, for which one feel thankful","excerpt":"but, short as it is, it seems too long.There is, however, on the same program those excellent subjects of the past—\\"Potemkin\\" and \\"The Last Laugh.\\" THE SCREEN; The First Lady of Mars."},{"year":"1996","title":"After reading DANCE FOR THE DEAD (Random House, $21), another heart-thumping  thriller by Thomas Perry, the motivated reader will be able to embezzle trust funds, loot S & L's, pull off real estate swindles, rifle the United States mail, establish a false identity and a pristine credit rating, and elude a gang  of hit men in a sophisticated game of airport tag. None of us, however, will be  able to perform these feats with the exquisite finesse of Jane Whitefield, a Seneca Indian with intuitive perception and extraordinary tracking skills. This heroine is a private agent who finds people who want to be lost and helps other people disappear like smoke. That she remains thoroughly likable while breaking every law on the books has something to do with her fierce -- and very    personal -- sense of justice.         Here Jane appoints herself the guardian angel of Timmy Phillips, a little boy with a big trust fund. The master criminal who had Timmy's foster parents murdered has an ingenious scheme for plundering his inheritance","excerpt":"but, since \\"none of this works if the heir is alive,\\" Jane takes aggressive action to save  his life.

Review/Television;   How the Schools' Failure Is a Business Crisis, Too"},{"year":"1930","title":"KARL FROELICH, the director, never did anything of exceptional interest in the silent days. The most one could say for his work was that it was tasteful. But the talker has brought him out of himself, given his subtlety a chance to express itself. Last Spring \\"The Night is Ours\\" had a tremendous success, and, considering that it was one of the very first German talkers, had considerable quality. And now he followed this up last week with \\"Brand in der Oper\\" (Fire in the Opera House) at the Capitol—one of the best German talkers made to date.Especially the handling of the dialogue is brilliant in the extreme. The players talk like human beings, characterize vocally and express the finest gradations of emotion with the rise and fall of an inflection. With the exception of a few performances under Reinhardt's direction, at the intimate Komödie, I have never heard effects of half such vocal delicacy achieved on the stage. The recording microphone is a tricky instrument, as willful as only a machine can be, but when it is mastered it brings the personality of an actor and the skill of a director nearer to the galleries and the back half of the orchestra than was ever possible in the theatre.This picture also deserves a credit mark for introducing us to the devious byways of Gustav Gruendgen's personality. Dapper, bald, with monocle in eye and a hard line around his mouth, he is a younger von Stroheim with considerably more variety. His very inability to be sympathetic makes us feel for him doubly. And Froelich has made splendid use of this quality here by putting him in the role of a successful business man for whom nobody really cares. And then the cast also contains Germany's most superior leading man, Gustav Fröhlich (no relation to the director).Thrills and Music.The plot is not startling, but it suffices. Its leading figures, a millionaire, his secretary and a young opera singer, are mixed according to the usual recipe. The rich man wants her, but she falls in love with the poor youth. The influence of the business man, who is subsidizing the local opera house, gets her a chance to sing a leading rôle, but, just as she is about to make her entrance, fire breaks out in the theatre. The two rescue her together, and their friendship, which was broken on account of their rivalry in love, is cemented again. And the girl sticks to the secretary. All of which gives us an excellent opportunity to hear scenes from \\"Tannhäuser\\" and the \\"Tales of Hoffmann,\\" both at rehearsals and during the performance. The Tobis has done itself proud in recording all this, especially the singing of the splendid coloratura, Jarmila Novodtna.Klangfilm, however, did not do so well with the tones that issued from the throats of the players in the latest Ufa picture. \\"Dolly Macht Karriere\\" (Dolly's Way to Stardom) at the Kurfürstendamm. The singing sounds pretty diabolical, and the conversation is usually 100 per cent tin. This is hard lines on the young Russian director Anatol Litwak, whose clever direction is thus badly handicapped.Old Idea Well Done.The theme of a little salesgirl who becomes a cabaret star overnight has to depend entirely on its treatment—for we certainly cannot be expected to work up any excitement about that plot scheme in this day and age. But the scenario writers and the director have had enough novel notions to keep the plot simmering satisfactorily. And Dolly Haas, the 18-year-old little star, has eyes like wet plums and considerable ability for grotesque dancing. If she were a little bit more like herself than like a lot of other actresses, it would have been preferable","excerpt":"but, then, that will probably come. The high point of the picture was Alfred Abel as a cock-eyed nobleman. Although Abel is not a singer, he put over every phrase of the song that fell to him—despite the machinations of the Klangfilm loud-speaker.\\"The Jazz King.\\"But the Klangfilm reproducing equipment at the Ufa Palast could do little damage to the splendid recording of Paul Whiteman in \\"The Jazz Ring.\\" The tone of that gorgeous collection of instruments came over to us almost wholly undiluted and an American in foreign lands sniffed the pleasant snuff of Broadway. I have heard that they were not so enthusiastic about the film in America, but here, where we have had none of this sort, it was soothing both to eye and ear. The German public was entertained by it, although the critics high-hatted it, stigmatizing it as a collection of all the \\"Kitsches\\" (might be translated as hokum, sentimentality and the rubber stamp rolled into one). Arnold Korff, one of the finest of the older German actors, was the master of ceremonies in the German version. He accomplished that difficult task with ease and charm—he did not annoy the audience at all, and that takes considerable doing in this most thankless of all forms of dramatic tidying up.Complain as we may about the talker, we need only see an old-fashioned movie, however well made, to realize that the addition of dialogue is a tremendous advance. Seeing actors talk and then reading their words in a lengthy title now seems a ridiculous convention. And the color and inflection of the voices is a very powerful means of characterization—without it the figures seem no more than ghosts. AUDIBLE FILMS INSPIRE GERMAN PRODUCERS; Thrills and Music. Old Idea Well Done. \\"The Jazz King.\\""},{"year":"1921","title":"Of course, there's no denying that Norma Talmadge is one of the American screen actresses who can really act and that Herbert Brenon is a director who can make vividly expressive moving pictures, so it is readily admitted that any production to which they jointly devote their efforts can hardly be without something to recommend it, but—How do such competent persons come as close to concealing their talents as they do in \\"The Wonderful Thing,\\" the photoplay at the Strand this week? Except for a few scenes, and, perhaps, its consistently good photographic quality, it might be the work of almost any of the many mediocre actresses and directors in the numerous studios between the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts.For instance, the picture is excessively talky. There is almost no scene in it which means anything without its accompanying, and interruptive, subtitles. In fact, the story is told in words. If all of the pictures were taken out of it, it would still be fairly complete and intelligible. Yet Mr. Brenon has shown in other productions that he can make expressive moving pictures that do not need the verbal crutch. Why hasn't he done so here? When it is reported that his scenes are well composed, except those in which the frame is allowed to clip off the tops of the players heads, and that the photography, as a rule, is sort yet clear, the most that may be said by way of recommendation for his work has been put down. Of expressive kinetic photography there is practically nothing in the picture.Miss Talmadge is a pantomimist. In other pictures she has shown that she can make her thoughts and feelings known by silent acting, by facial expressions, gestures, postures and movements of her body. Yet, in this picture she does little besides talk. In a few scenes there are flashes of pantomime, but most of the time she just moves her lips as if, when she was making the photoplay, she thought the motion picture camera was a phonograph. And she's no better at moving her lips on the screen than hundreds of other actresses. But she's a far better pantomimist when she chooses to be.Nor do the others in the cast do anything special. Most conspicuous among them, because of her social prominence and the publicity that attended her entrance into motion picture work, is Mrs. Lydig Hoyt, who is programmed as Julia Hoyt and has a minor rôle in the photoplay. Whether Mrs. Hoyt is a screen actress of the first rank remains to be seen. She has't much chance in \\"The Wonderful Thing,\\" and, with the others, does little besides talk.The story of the production can be accepted only as a fairy tale. It is billed as an adaptation of the play of the same name by Lillian Trimble Bradley, but how closely it follows its original the present writer cannot say. In its screen form it makes free use of the \\"Peg o My Heart\\" idea, with the Frenchified daughter of a wealthy American hog raiser playing the rôle of despised benefactor in a snobbish English home. The story is kept going by all sorts of complications, any one of which would have been straightened out in two minutes by the exercise of a little common sense by any of the persons involved","excerpt":"but, then, the story would not have been kept going.The St???nd commemorates Armistice Week and the opening of the Washington conference with a Kineto picture of the victory pageants held in the various allied countries and a prologue on \\"Peace.\\" \\"The Love Egg,\\" a Punch comedy, is also on the bill.Edith M. Hull's novel, \\"The Sheik,\\" which seems to have provided some kind of entertainment for numerous readers and no little amusement for the book reviewers, has followed the path of all popular fiction and may be seen on the screens of the Rivoli and Rialto Theatres this week, that is, a photoplay calling itself \\"The Sheik\\" and acknowledging Mrs. Hull's story as its parent is being offered. Again the writer must confess that he has not read the novel from which a photoplay under review has been derived. He knew he would have to see the picture sooner or later. Isn't that enough?Anyhow, the photoplay tells the story of an unusually spiritless English girl who is abducted by an exceedingly gentle desert sheik, but will not admit that she loves him until she is captured by a really rough Arab and realizes how perfectly safe she is with her tamer admirer. Somehow, this doesn't seem to be exactly the idea of Mrs. Hull's novel as reported in the book reviews, but never mind; here's the picture tale of a nice sheik and his agreeable English girl. And you won't be offended by having a white girl marry an Arab, either, for the sheik isn't really a native of the desert at all. Oh, no; he's the son of a Spanish father and an English mother who were killed when he was a baby so the old sheik could raise him as his son. These romantic Arabian movies, you know, never have the courage of their romantics.Agnes Ayres is the girl and Rudolph Valentino is the sheik. Both of them can make the characters they impersonate seem real in a picture, which gives any character a chance to seem real.George Melford directed the production and, although he has given it no cinematographic quality, he has made many elaborate scenes, using the desert effectively a number of times. The only trouble in this connection is that he has used the desert too much, and especially too much in the sun. If realism was his object he has certainly accomplished it. By the time half a dozen of these glaring white desert scenes have followed each other on the screen your eyes are ready to give up. Those who go to see the picture would do well to take their amber glasses with them.The Rivoli and Rialto programs are enlivened by one of those ingenious and amusing doll comedies periodically issued as \\"Funny Face\\" productions without credit to the person or persons who make them. The magazines at these two theatres also emphasize Armistice Week and the Washington conference with pictures of the men prominent during the war and since.\\"The Ropin' Fool,\\" with Will Rogers, and \\"Never Weaken,\\" with Harold Lloyd are the main features of a bill of short subjects at the Capitol. As in other theatres the week is observed in various pictorial and musical numbers.
