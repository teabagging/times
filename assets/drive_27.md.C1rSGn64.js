They circle each other in carefully choreographed movements","excerpt":"alternately each literally frames the other by his own person and by his mirror image. (Miss Duras loves to see things in and through glass‚Äîmirrors, windshields, windows). The revelations, though obliquely made, are quite specific. She was unfaithful. He once planned to murder her, She, unknown to him, once tried to commit suicide.With the revelations comes the ironic realization that, although each is committed to someone else, they've just fallen in love. The most that they can hope for themselves is that they'll possibly meet again, sometime in the future, by accident. In some peculiar, cockeyed way, this seems to be a bridge beyond death, a lot more austere but no less romantic, in the context, than the faith that was to reunite Spencer Tracy and Irene Dunne in the clouds over Hollywood in \\"A Guy Named Joe.\\"Because Miss Duras writes so elliptically, there is no special sense that she has padded her original play until the confrontation in the hotel lobby. At that point, however, one realizes that all that has gone before has been rather superior but ultimately superfluous vamping, including the introduction of a character not in the play, a young American girl (Julie Dassin), who appears to be simply the reflection of one of the husband's long-ago infidelities talked about in the play.\\"La Musica\\" is intellectually chic moviemaking of the sort that is quite entertaining while it is going on but practically ceases to exist, even as a memory, when it's over. Hossein and Miss Seyrig read their lines with style and look marvelously unhappy, she, especially, in blond bob that evokes the 1930's and the image of Lilyan Tashman.The New York Film Festival, which showed \\"La Musica\\" last night at Philharmonic Hall, is presenting Miss Duras, in her role as a film director, in a reversed-time sequence. Having shown \\"Destroy, She Said,\\" the French novelist-playwright's second directorial effort last year, the festival this year selected her first film \\"La Musica,\\" made in 1966 and co-directed with Paul Seban, who had earlier collaborated with her on a series of television productions.

Although he was a jazz pioneer, Oliver died in obscurity in 1938. His music is less than seven decades old, but listening to it demands a radical readjustment for ears trained on pop, European music or more recent jazz. Seeking the melody is pointless, because the melody is everywhere and nowhere.    In the music Oliver recorded in 1923, which made up most of the program on Tuesday night, solos and accompaniment often merge. Flamboyant individuality balances with teamwork","excerpt":"although instruments have customary roles, everyone improvises while everyone carries the tune. At Lincoln Center, the clarinetist Michael White led nine musicians in transcriptions of Oliver's repertory, and it was a chance to hear the music's many layers in ways the murky recordings have always impeded.    Process and product were interchangeable in Oliver's jazz; a good part of its splendor was the fact that the band was toying with the music as it went along. Playing the music note for note destroys the original process, and the music was altered in various ways: rendered more formal for much of the evening and slightly burlesqued here and there. While the music perked up when it departed from the transcriptions to allow band members' own solos, even the note-for-note Oliver was spunky and revealing.    As recorded, the Oliver band's slow blues and jaunty rags were models of compression, packing an introduction, a theme or two and various episodes and stop-time breaks into the 3-minute 20-second maximum playing time. The music reveals the tension and synthesis between New Orleans' Creole musicians, who were educated in European music, and its lower-class hot-jazz musicians: decorous ensemble introductions soon give way to strutting improvisation, and the nearly continuous clarinet obbligatos move between classical arpeggios and bluesy slides.    The Oliver bands' trademark was to have the rest of the group drop out as the two cornetists, Oliver and his protege Louis Armstrong, played tandem phrases they had come up with during the song, to create a magically coordinated double improvisation. There were three cornetists onstage at Alice Tully Hall -- Wynton Marsalis, Nicholas Payton and Greg Stafford -- but only two played at a time, and all three caught some of the style of Oliver and early Armstrong.    That style was stiffer rhythmically and more self-effacing than the sound of trumpeters to follow. Instead, it had an easy, leisurely assurance and a sly way with blue notes. Mr. Marsalis, playing \\"King Porter Stomp\\" with Wycliffe Gordon, on tuba, and Don Vappie, on banjo, merged his own long-breathed approach with the Oliver style, interpreting the original solo while adding something of his own. In his own solo on \\"Snake Rag,\\" Mr. Marsalis switched to an Armstrong mode, broadening his tone and slyly dragging out notes.    The band couldn't always match its models. Fred Lonzo had too many crowd-pleasing trombone growls, Mr. White just missed the suave sweetness of Oliver's clarinetists and two slow blues, featuring the singer Thais Clarke, sounded like self-conscious reproductions instead of death-haunted or sultry declarations. But in a musical tradition that changes as fast as jazz, it is remarkable to find a young ensemble that looks back as convincingly as the one that performed \\"At the Court of King Oliver.\\" The group also included Farid Barron, on piano, and Herlin Riley, on drums.

These things can perhaps best be summed up under the heading of gigolo and Junior League","excerpt":"although there seems to be a touch of mannic depressive insanity as well. That is contributed, rather unexpectedly, by \\"Five and Ten's\\" son.However, far beyond the glum out-look of the economic lords is the fact that the picture is enjoyable. Marion Davies has a part in it‚Äîthat of the merchant's daughter; and also there is Leslie Howard. He glides gently along his way, making love in that bland way best known to young architects and playwrights on the Riviera. And then, toward the end, when he has used up all the possible humor of his own part, he seems to chuckle gently about \\"Five and Ten's\\" conclusion. He is right about that.It seems that John Rarick came out of the West with a wife and a son and a daughter and an endless chain of stores. Lost in business, he paid no attention to his family, so they went their various ways. His wife met with a man with a rumba sort of moustache and the name of Ramon. His daughter tried to get into society and ultimately fell in love with a young architect. His son started drinking whisky with the servants.The play, however, mostly con-cerns the daughter and the architect, who conduct themselves with a gen-teel sort of wit not unlike that of the stage's \\"Strictly Dishonorable.\\" There are misunderstandings, mar-riages to other people, recriminations and charges. Finally, however, these things being what they are, there is a wedding. But only after the son has tried to kill himself in an airplane, and the mother has tried to run off with her appealing Ramon. The merchant, of course, then real-izes the futility of it all.A somber contemplation of the above suggests that without Miss Davies and Mr. Howard \\"Five and Ten\\" would be only a something reminiscent of the old flickering days of the movies. But the two are supported by a good cast‚ÄîIrene Rich, Richard Bennett, Lee Beranger and Mary Duncan among them‚Äîand manage to move the picture along its bright way until almost the end. Then it does go down, a fact appar-ently known to both Mr. Howard and the audience. But yesterday's didn't seem to care.
