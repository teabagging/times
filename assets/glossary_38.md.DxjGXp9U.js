His cooking is based on his brilliant use of fresh vegetable juices and flavored oils for his sauces rather than butter or cream.

His fall menu includes starters like seared scallops with a tartare of beets and parsley juice, and sauteed sweetbreads with chestnuts and a drizzle of truffle vinaigrette.

In opening statements, the chief prosecutor, Col. Vasile Kozma, said 94 people had died in the Timisoara violence, 300 were wounded and 20 were missing. Early in the revolution, reports from Timisoara spoke of up to 4,000 people dying there.   As the trial began 180 miles west of here, the Justice Minister announced in Bucharest that the chief of the military tribunal that condemned Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife to death had committed suicide.   In Timisoara, armored personnel carriers and soldiers surrounded Casa Tineretului theater, now converted into a courtroom. The proceedings are the first against those suspected of trying to crush the uprising before it spread across the country. #7 Charged With Genocide The defendants, headed by Maj. Gen. Emil Macri, sat glumly in their striped-brown prison suits as the indictment was read. General Macri and six others are charged with genocide and face life in prison if convicted. The 14 others face up to 20 years in prison if convicted on lesser charges stemming from the shootings of unarmed civilians who took to the streets of Timisoara in December to demonstrate against Mr. Ceausescu.   The death of the chief judge in the Ceausescu trial was announced here at a news conference by Justice Minister Teofil Pop, who said the official, Maj. Gen. Gica Popa, 57 years old, shot himself in the head with his pistol on Thursday in his Justice Ministry office.   Mr. Pop said General Popa was taken to the Bucharest military hospital, where he died two hours later with his wife and daughter by his side. The general left a suicide note that asked forgiveness, but did not explain the motive for his act, Mr. Pop reported.   But General Popa's wife, Eleonora, said her husband had been receiving anonymous threats since Dec. 25, the date of the trial and execution of Mr. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena.   The Justice Minister said the general's voice was the one heard on the video recording of the trial. The recording was broadcast repeatedly on Romanian and international television.   General Popa was reportedly the official who announced that the Ceausescus would be executed.

Medieval and Renaissance man ignored the traces laid down by ancient Rome and made their own rules, turning Florence, in its circle of hills, into an architectural jewel. The city's narrow streets open suddenly onto broad, expansive piazzas, which provide breathing spaces of exquisite design, encouraging one to emerge from the cool, private shadows of gray back alleys into powerful sunlit vistas.   Florence may stupefy a visitor with its artistic and architectural richness, but thanks to human proportions and harmony of design never loses its human feel. A surprising number of Florentines get around by bicycle, but walking is still the best way to see the city, especially now that pedestrian zones have reduced traffic in some central areas to an almost tolerable level. Ask for help finding the right bus and someone will probably take you in hand till you reach your destination. But despite such small town touches, the graceful city has a cosmopolitan flair.  Events    Maggio Musicale, the city's celebrated May music festival, actually runs from April 26 to July 1. Zubin Mehta conducts the festival orchestra for Schoenberg's \\"Moses und Aron\\" on April 26 and 29, and for works by Mozart and Bartok May 4 and 5. Mikhail Baryshnikov and his White Oak Dance Project will perform April 28. Other performers this year include the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra on May 8 and the Chung Trio on May 12.

For the only slightly more adventurous it's possible to get a real sea voyage on a luxurious vessel at the expenditure of very little time or money in such prime vacation regions as the North and Baltic Seas and the Inside Passage to Alaska.   Just a few examples: Norway Line's Jupiter sails three times weekly in each direction between Newcastle (England) and Bergen (Norway). On the Monday eastbound and Friday westbound trips, she makes a glorious daylight run through the skerries along the coast between Bergen and Stavanger, where there is enough scenery to satisfy the most jaded traveler or photographer. Jupiter and her running mate Venus operate in the winter as Mediterranean cruise ships, and they are far from Spartan. In the ferry mode, the one-way voyage takes about 24 hours. Fares range from $104 for a sleeperette to $194 in a two-berth deluxe. These can be booked in the United States through DFDS Danish Seaways (505 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017","excerpt":"212- 986-2711).

It's the author and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, strolling Paris-style streets on a stopover to Dakar. It's Edith Piaf, holed up in a hotel with her lover, the prizefighter Marcel Cerdan. It's Josephine Baker, crooning ''J'ai Deux Amours'' at the Art Deco Rialto theater. And, ultimately, it's Humphrey Bogart, telling Ingrid Bergman that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.     But truth be told, the glamour wore off a long time ago. With its majestically faded architecture and dusty colonial boulevards, this rough-edged metropolis of four million feels like a fossil of bygone days, which is exactly what makes Casablanca so enticing. Its raffish air and melancholy grandeur -- more evocative of Havana than Hong Kong -- are the rare exception to a shrinking, touristy world of design-minded boutique hotels and Wallpaper-style homogeneity.      These days, the grandiose architecture concocted by the French colonialists -- sinewy Art Nouveau edifices, cool Art Deco town houses, collagelike Neo-Moorish palaces -- has made the city a giant museum. Under the eye of the world's tallest minaret, men and women still walk along the palm-lined medinas in hooded djellaba robes and head-covering hijab. And with the exception of Casablanca's thoroughly contemporary night life, the newest hot spots exploit the city's aging bones, resurrecting venerable structures into period boutiques and cafes.    WHERE TO STAY -- A new bright spot in Casablanca's staid hotel scene, Dar Itrit (9, rue Restinga","excerpt":"212-22-36-02-58; www.daritrit.ma), is a rare specimen indeed: an intimate bed-and-breakfast at a quiet remove from downtown. It is housed in a whitewashed 1940's villa, which was converted into a hotel by a French couple in 2004, and is outfitted with Moorish mirrors, inlaid tables, Oriental carpets and other Old World Moroccan touches. The hotel has one single (65 euros, about $81, at $1.24 to the euro) and two doubles (75 euros), all with shared bathrooms. Breakfast is included.      Self-made sultans of business and style stride up the red-carpeted steps, under the soaring oriental archway and into the opulent Le Royal Mansour Méridien (27, avenue des Forces Armées Royales; 212-22-31-21-12; www.mansour.lemeridien.com). Though built in the 1950's, it is a modern Moorish affair, complete with high-speed Internet access, a spa, a gym and upscale restaurants. Low-season doubles start at 2,900 dirhams, about $319, at 9.10 dirhams to the dollar.     To live la vie en rose (with a daily linen change), follow the footsteps of Piaf and Cerdan to the Hotel Transatlantique (79, rue Chaouia; 212-22-29-45-51; www.transatcasa.com). Built in 1922, the Art Deco structure holds a riot of Oriental carpets, urns, mounted rifles, statues of Nubian princesses and other riches. Doubles from 840 dirhams.    WHERE TO EAT -- When the French pulled out of Morocco in 1956, they left behind an appreciation for fine food and drink that persists to this day. Paris-style bistros are entrenched in Casablanca's culinary landscape, and French ingredients infuse top restaurants that are not ostensibly Gallic. Prices below are based on a three-course meal for two, without wine.     Despite its gimmicky name, Rick's Café (248, boulevard Sour Jdid, Old Medina; 212-22-27-42-07) has become one of the city's chicest restaurants and bars since its 2004 debut. Inspired by ''Casablanca,'' the exquisite mini-palace evokes the glamour and exoticism of the city's cinematic glory. By night, bartenders in white jackets and red fezes pour cocktails for an international crowd dining on parfait de foie gras, roast duck in mango sauce and other French-tinged specialties. About 500 dirhams.      Fancy a fillet of ostrich? Join local foodies at A Ma Bretagne (Boulevard de l'Ocean Atlantique, Sidi Abderrahmane; 212-22-39-79-79). Operated by one of the nation's most decorated chefs, André Halbert, a Frenchman, this modern, oceanfront restaurant was designed by Brigitte Martinez, a Philippe Starck student with more restraint than her teacher. Within the airy glass and wood space, bourgeois Moroccan and French couples sip selections from the extensive international wine list and dine on a seasonal menu based on market availability. Recent specials included sea bass tartare, duck a l'orange, king prawns in flaky pastry, John Dory fish in lobster sauce and ostrich. A selection of classic desserts (like chocolate soufflé and poached pears) and petit fours winds up the evening. About 800 dirhams.      The humble pigeon becomes culinary art at Al Mounia (95, rue du Prince Moulay Abdellah; 212-22-22-26-69). Diced, stuffed into puff pastry and topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon, the bird forms the core of the excellent pastilla at this ornate shrine to traditional Moroccan fare. Also on the menu are very good sweet-savory tajine stews, grilled kebabs and spiced couscous piled with judiciously tender meats and vegetables. Dazzling Moorish décor creates a dramatic dining atmosphere. Around 600 dirhams.      For dessert, tote your vintage Hermès bag to the intersection of Boulevard Moulay Rachid and Boulevard d'Anfa, where you'll find the Villa Zevaco (212-22-36-60-00). A sleek, modernist 1949 house, seemingly airlifted from Palm Springs, it has recently become an outpost of Paul, the upscale French patisserie chain. The hangout serves sorbets, chocolate croissants, hot chocolate and an extensive brunch (for 99 dirhams) to Casablanca's air-kissing socialites.    WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY -- Imbibe Casablanca's distinctive architectural cocktail. Though run-down, the Art Nouveau buildings along the Boulevard de Paris, Boulevard Mohammed V and Avenue Lalla Yacout are teeming with wrought-iron balconies, sinewy curves, tendril-like ornamentation and other details that suggest the 16th arrondissement in Paris. Morocco's version of prehip Miami is the Gauthier district, which radiates with Art Deco buildings. And in the city's downtown, the Rialto theater remains a singular landmark. Seemingly carved from lemon and strawberry sherbet, the Rialto (35, rue Mohammed Qorri) in 1943 was host to Josephine Baker, who was living in Casablanca at the time.      Gothic and Art Deco merge at the abandoned Sacré Coeur cathedral, a huge sepulchral presence on Boulevard Rachidi. In Place Mohammed V, the large central post office and other administrative buildings embody the Neo-Moorish style, a fusion of centuries-old Arabo-Andalusian details and modern Le Corbusier-esque functionalism.      The icon of the Casablanca skyline is the towering 656-foot minaret of the Hassan II Mosque (Boulevard Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah; 212-22-48-28-86). The third-largest mosque in the world (after those in Mecca and Medina), Hassan II was finished in 1993 after six years of round-the-clock labor by some 10,000 artisans. Tours (120 dirhams) daily except Friday.    WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT -- Come weekends, Casablanca goes cosmopolitan. French expatriate businessmen loosen their ties, staff members of international embassies from the nearby capital, Rabat, arrive in party mode, and Moroccan professionals and socialites don their best European fashions. Conveniently, the city's nocturnal scene is concentrated along the seaside corniche in the Aïn Diab district, another haven of Art Deco edifices. Like an all-night buffet, this coastal strip is lined with D.J. lounges, live music sites and Arab-themed discos full of smoldering chicha pipes.      One of the most stylish spots is the very sleek and very pink Candy Bar lounge in the Hotel Riad Salam (Boulevard de la Corniche Aïn Diab; 212-22-79-84-40). At Armstrong (41, boulevard de la Corniche Aïn Diab; 212-22-79-76-56), the band is so loud that you can barely think. Still, the place attracts dense throngs of 20- and 30-somethings, and the festive vibe is contagious. For a mellower scene, head to the minimalist-chic Mystic Garden (33, boulevard de la Corniche Aïn Diab; 212-22-79-88-77), a restaurant-bar that offers a counterdose of Scandinavian design and mellow music.    WHERE TO SHOP -- For one-stop shopping, the nearby Twin Center (191, boulevard Zerktouni) houses a high-end mall below its dual towers. Walk into the cool white marble atrium and walk out with Fendi sunglasses, an armful of Swatches, sacks of Agatha jewelry and a closet full of Italian footwear.      For chic Moorish-modern home décor, hit Thema Maison (27, rue Houssine Ben Ali; 212-22-22-03-60). The Art Deco town house is stocked with tufted cushions, psychedelic blankets, eggplant-colored drapes, tangerine-hued table runners and other ethno-chic concoctions. Moorish antiques can be found, at a price, at Amazonite (15, rue du Prince Moulay Abdellah; 212-22-29-50-19). Buyers scour Morocco for Fez pottery, Berber jewelry, inlaid woodwork and more.    HOW TO STAY WIRED -- Just off the Prince Moulay Abdellah pedestrian shopping street is G@.Net (29, rue Abdelkader Al Moftaker; 212-22-22-95-23). High-speed Internet access costs 10 dirhams (about $1) an hour.    YOUR FIRST TIME OR YOUR 10TH -- The mazelike passages of the Old Medina -- Casablanca's 18th-century town -- are a welcome antidote to the busy modern city. Amid the echoing calls to prayer and the shouts of hawkers working the souk, an ancient world unfolds: men in djelleba robes praying in small mosques; fully veiled women toting groceries; pushcarts laden with fish rumbling over the stones. The New Medina, a post-World War I creation, is another Neo-Moorish masterwork by French colonial architects. Visit the colorful olive market and handicraft stalls.    HOW TO GET THERE -- Morocco's national airline, Royal Air Maroc (800-344-6726; www.royalairmaroc.com), offers several nonstop flights a week from Kennedy Airport. Round-trip fares for April begin at $768, taxes included. From May 17 to June 12, the airline's Web site is offering a special promotional fare starting at $499, taxes not included.    HOW TO GET AROUND -- Casablanca's red ''petit taxis'' are cheap and abundant. On the meter, most trips around the central neighborhoods will cost 10 to 20 dirhams. A trip to the Aïn Diab night-life district runs closer to 30 or 35. The minimum charge is 7 dirhams. After 8 p.m., the meters increase by 50 percent.

Several years earlier Mr. Frank had, with Alfred Leslie, directed Peter Orlovsky and his lover, the poet Allen Ginsberg, in ''Pull My Daisy'' (1959), a Beat Generation time capsule and one of the defining films of the New American Cinema. Partly inspired by ''Kaddish,'' Mr. Ginsberg's poem about his mother's mental illness, Mr. Frank subsequently turned his attention to Mr. Orlovsky's brother, Julius, a seemingly catatonic schizophrenic living with Mr. Orlovsky and Mr. Ginsberg. (Julius is at top left, with Mr. Ginsberg, center, and Peter. Above are Peter Orlovsky, left, and Mr. Ginsberg.) Shot in color and in black and white, the lyrically ragged, casually moving results present a man who often seems defined less by his presence than by his absence, at times literally, as when Julius wanders away from his brother's protective care. Written by Mr. Frank and Sam Shepard, ''Me and My Brother'' (finished in 1968, re-edited in 1997) stutters forward with a mix of loosely staged and documentarylike scenes, some involving the theater guru Joseph Chaikin as a fictionalized version of Julius. There's a measure of comedy in the scenes of Mr. Chaikin trying to find the character called Julius, partly because the actor is performing the role for a director -- a stand-in for Mr. Frank, complete with Germanic-accented English -- who is, in turn, played by Roscoe Lee Browne and by a very young Christopher Walken. Despite these interpretative strategies, the real Julius remains a mystery until the astonishing finale, which doesn't as much end the film as leave it hanging and ready for further inquiry.

At the hospital, she said, the staff ''wouldn't look me in the eye, they acted as if it was just another medical procedure.'' After labor was induced and the baby was stillborn, Mrs. Lieberman went home and cried for weeks, thinking she must be crazy because she so deeply missed a child she had never known.   Last spring, Mrs. Lieberman had a miscarriage, this time in her third month. By then she and her husband, Thomas, had two healthy children, but they were not the only reason, she said, that her second loss was less devastating than her first.

The museum, with a collection ranging from the 16th century to the present and an emphasis on Spanish, Flemish and Italian artists, traces its history to 1744 when the academy was founded during the reign of King Felipe V. The collection is housed in the renovated and remodeled Palace of Juan de Goyeneche, a banker for whom the palace was constructed in 1710 by the architect Churriguera in the Baroque style. It was later redone in the neo-classical style by Diego Villanueva.   The museum (at Alcala 13, between Puerta del Sol and Plaza de Cibeles) is open Tuesday through Saturday from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M. and on Sunday and Monday from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M. Admission is about $1.50.

Called a petite hotel, the 72-room Night opened in April with a fresh coat of black paint, an orgy of black leather and erotic black-and-white photographs that vaguely recall Madonna's ''Sex'' book. But if the hotel, in the heart of Times Square, is trying to resurrect the area's noir past, it comes across as yet another Disneyesque addition to the commercial, design-for-the-masses district.    THE LOCATION -- A busy side street lined with tourist traps, including a Planet Hollywood, Irish pubs and a $35-a-night hostel. Keep your street-facing window closed, unless you like the sound of rumbling trucks by day and honking taxis by night.    THE ROOMS -- First impressions were gloomy. My ''deluxe'' room (No. 68) was pitch-black when I checked in at midafternoon, save for a halolike glow emanating from under the bed. At first glance, the kitschy effect suggested a coffin in an S&M dungeon. The thermostat, inexplicably set to a bone-chilling 63 degrees, added to the funereal vibe.     After fiddling with some knobs, the room warmed up somewhat, but it was still dark and a little cramped. Half the room was taken up by the king-size bed, which had an imposing leather headboard that flared out like Dracula's cape. The rest of the furniture was also black, including an oak desk, an office chair, a side table and a bed stool. Adding a touch of whimsy were the wallpaper and the curtains, which have a toilesque pattern of thorny weeds -- not that a real plant could survive in the darkness.    BATHROOM -- Windowless and closetlike, with a glass-partitioned shower, a corner vanity and Molton Brown toiletries. The color palette should come as no surprise: charcoal-black tiles and bone-white floors. Don't expect to take a long, hot bath, because there was no tub. But the plush Frette towels and Kohler rain shower head did offer a touch of indulgence.    AMENITIES -- All rooms come with Wi-Fi Internet service, plasma screen TV's (currently limited to basic cable), a Bose nightstand stereo and, if you inquire at the front desk, a black iPod Nano preloaded with moody electronica. Too bad my iPod died after an hour. That was barely long enough to take advantage of the $12-a-day pass to an Equinox gym five blocks away.    ROOM SERVICE -- The menu was limited in late April. The most filling (and expensive) item on the menu was a hot dog, albeit a fancy one: ''Kobe beef hot dog, caramelized onions, truffle peach mustard'' for $16. And although it showed up promptly on a silver tray, I had to call back twice for utensils and coffee creamer. A full menu, available 24 hours, started this month, and there is a restaurant, Nightlife. The concierge can secure dinner reservations, tickets to Broadway shows and even entrance to popular nightclubs like Crobar in Chelsea.    THE CROWD -- Not as attractive as the vampirelike vixens in the lobby photographs. But there were plenty of dark-suited French businessmen, stylish women in black cocktail dresses and trendy tourists in sunglasses.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- Gothic fantasia at a sober price, at least by Gotham standards. Standard rooms start at $249 a night and queen rooms at $289. Two eighth-floor penthouse suites opened last week. The smaller one is $745 a night, and a larger one $1,200. The Night Hotel is at 132 West 45th Street","excerpt":"212-835-9600, www.nighthotelny.com.

CALENDAR: CRAFTS AND WOODCARVINGS"},{"year":"2005","title":"THE BASICS -- The fellow who brought breakfast to the door gave a good-morning grin -- was chatty, even. At any other lodging, this would be a good thing. Parsing solicitude at the Royalton, however, is more complicated. Indifference by the runway-ready help was a hallmark of the 169-room Royalton after Ian Schrager and partners opened it in 1988. Seventeen years later, how is the country's first hotel-as-happening holding up? The verdict: This aging party girl still looks good in Mr. Schrager's dim mood lighting and still attracts a crowd, even if it's not the everybody-who's-anybody crowd of a decade ago.    THE LOBBY AND BAR -- The Royalton's centerpiece remains the Philippe Starck-designed lobby-cum-bar-- where those checking in still must walk that long, royal-blue carpet (runway?) where, in an earlier era, each entrant was sized up. Five years ago, most of the original white, chrome-legged chairs and sofas in the lobby were fitted with white slipcovers. That, plus the cranked techno music makes the place feels as if Miss Havisham had held a rave.    THE CROWD -- In the early 1990's, the hotel's restaurant, 44 at the Royalton, was known as Club Condé because the top of the Condé Nast masthead --Tina Brown, Graydon Carter, et al. -- had regular power lunches there. That heyday may be past, but by midmorning on an autumn weekday the adjacent bar's sunken area was already filled: a fashion journalist in cowboy boots conducted an interview, a woman showed high-end cosmetics to buyers. By cocktail hour, the place filled again with young suits in recline -- and every sofa remained occupied at 11 p.m. One thing that the Royalton can still do is make the terminally unhip feel a little queasy. A man (thin, bespectacled, tuxedoed) and his wife (large, draped in what appeared to be a sequined shower curtain) walked the blue carpet, looked nervously about. She took his hand. Still thirsty, they found the exit.    THE ROOMS -- Reaching the guest rooms via hallways of twilight blue-purple is like walking through a Coen brothers movie. But the rooms brighten -- the dark wood and grays offset by white linens and walls -- and are bigger than some New York apartments. The queen bed, covered with a feather duvet, was reasonably comfortable , if not particularly firm. Some pieces of furniture were a tad scuffed. The turndown service never materialized.    THE BATHROOMS -- The deep greenish slate that bordered the guest room filled the entire bathroom, including the glass-fronted shower stall, creating a roomy, handsome space of glass, stone and chrome. (Some rooms at the same price can have bathtubs, so if you would like one, ask.) Agua bath products stood next to a fresh orchid and a cup of fading lavender buds. The mediocre bath towels felt oddly incongruent, as if they belonged in a Days Inn that had run out of fabric softener.    AMENITIES -- A small gym -- two treadmills, two bikes, an elliptical trainer, a StairMaster, some shiny barbells -- is shoehorned into a room-size space on the fourth floor. In the rooms, Wi-Fi Internet service is available for $10. Rooms have CD players and a generously stocked minibar. A free morning paper is delivered.    ROOM SERVICE --Breakfast arrived (with that unexpected smile) in the 15-minute period asked for -- a Midtown Benedict of just-runny-enough eggs topped with shaved salmon and hollandaise, and a wickedly sticky bun from Balthazar. There's a $5 fee for room service, and an 18 percent tip is added.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- If the bleeding edge is where your black-and-red Louis Vuitton yearns to rest, there are hotter spots than the slightly scuffed Royalton. But a hotel with a gossip-pages pedigree, a good breakfast and a still-sexy bar? That never goes completely out of style. Rates range from $365 to $685 depending on the season.

Among the ports of embarkation are Hamburg, Rotterdam or Antwerp; the journey takes about 90 days round trip from the port of embarkation to Australia and back to Europe.   The ships, which carry 12 passengers (no physician is required to be aboard a freighter that carries 12 or fewer passengers), have itineraries that vary.

The time would be spring or summer next year. - E. K., Randallstown, Md. Answer:Several wholesale tour companies that specialize in Israel have long experience of arranging this kind of trip, which is sold through travel agents. Generally, they don't deal directly with the public. Among such companies are: Unitours (60 East 42d Street, New York, N.Y. 10165","excerpt":"212-949-9500), Isram (630 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; 212-661-1193) and Foreign Tours (5 Penn Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10001; 212-947-9595 and 800-223-7500). A tour by minibus, larger bus or limousine usually starts in Tel Aviv and stops for overnights in Haifa, Tiberias and Jerusalem, with accommodations in first-class hotels. Most Israeli hotels provide a full buffet breakfast that is included in the rate. Company representatives said the land cost of an escorted tour would be about $100 to $150 a day a person, depending on the hotels used, and would include sightseeing. They said that while the current round-trip, New York-Tel Aviv air fare was $799, fares varied according to season. Fares are higher during Passover (April 24 to May 1 next year) and from the middle of June to the middle of July. Some flights are nonstop.

Answer:Most visitors explore this 300-mile-long island by taking bus and plane tours. While rental cars are available, tourist officials discourage extensive driving by visitors because many of the roads are of gravel and are not well marked. A few tours outside Reykjavik, the capital, are available in April and May but the busy tour season gets under way in June, after the damage to roads caused by winter frosts has been repaired, and continues through September.   Among the sightseeing attractions in Reykjavik are the National and Folk Museums, the Parliament building, the National Theater and the craft shops in the downtown section. These stores sell handmade sweaters and silver and pottery, some of which includes designs created by lava markings. Reykjavik Excursions is among the tour companies offering tours of the city and beyond. Its spring and summer tours of the city leave twice a day from the Loftleidir Hotel and the price is $11 a person.

The tour firms will also organize historical and literary tours for individuals or parties of fewer than 15 people, who are driven by a chauffeur-guide or drive themselves. (Many hotels give special rates to groups of least 15 people, which is also the number generally required to hire a tour bus.)

But some hybrids save hardly any fuel, energy efficiency advocates say.   16    Sovereignty for Hawaiians  A bill that for the first time would extend sovereignty to the native Hawaiian people is poised for a vote in the United States Senate despite opposition from many Republicans, who denounce the measure as unworkable.   14    Officer Charged in Killing  A Chicago police officer of 14 years was charged with murder in connection with a contract killing of a driver for a funeral home owned by the officer's family, the police said.   18    NEW YORK/REGION   25-31    AIDS Trials Investigated  Twenty years ago, doctors appealed for permission to include foster children in what they regarded as promising drug trials for AIDS treatment.
