This has nothing to do with the new staging, which is part of the Met's attempt to establish a traditional-Wagner in residence. The Met is setting the work precisely where Wagner wanted it: in 16th-century Nuremberg, where members of the various occupational guilds came together to create an elite organization of singing masters, heirs to a long tradition.   The source of discomfort is the opera itself. Music critics might justifiably feel disconcerted because of their resemblance to Beckmesser, the pedantic town clerk and master of \\"Die Meistersinger.\\" Critics (like Beckmesser) judge newcomers (like the opera's young aspirant, Walther), who claim nobility and immense musical gifts and wish to be declared Masters of the Art. They act as \\"Markers\\" -- stern graders slashing chalk across slates -- citing every supposedly broken rule, sometimes attacking fellow Markers with similar narrow-mindedness. Beckmesser can't actually create beauty himself","excerpt":"all he can do is find flaws, judging the new by the old.

There are no judgments made as to the quality of the submission","excerpt":"all manuscripts are accepted.   \\"We will have an important social history function,\\" said Todd Lockwood, who established the library. \\"This is a long-term historical time capsule we are creating. It seems to us that an anthropologist in the year 3000 would have a field day.\\"   By \\"us,\\" Mr. Lockwood means the board of trustees, among them a number of local and national writers and businesspeople, as well as Ianthe Swensen, Mr. Brautigan's daughter.   Ms. Swensen, who lives in Northern California, attended a private opening of the library last month, a day before it was opened to the public. She said later that her father, who died in 1984, would have been \\"ecstatic.\\"   The project \\"would be a unique tribute to my father, embodying the idea of creativity and community he held dear,\\" she wrote in response to Mr. Lockwood's proposal.   So far, only eight manuscripts have been bound and made part of the library, but 10 to 15 submissions have been rolling in each day, and organizers expect that the current quarters will eventually hold 8,000 volumes.   The notion of a library for unpublished manuscripts is not the first thing that drew Mr. Lockwood, again and again, to Mr. Brautigan's 1970 novel, \\"The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966.\\" What initially appealed to Mr. Lockwood, who owns a recording studio here, was the character of the librarian-hero. It was only on his fifth or sixth reading of the book that the idea of the library took hold, he said.   The library, open only on weekends for now, includes a number of distinctly Brautigan-like touches, appropriate to the man who came to public attention in the counterculture mood of the 1960's with his novel, \\"Trout Fishing in America.\\"   The sign out front proclaims the library to be \\"A Very Public Library.\\" The bylaws say no two reading chairs shall match.   Eschewing the Dewey Decimal System of book classification, books are classified under the \\"mayonnaise system,\\" \\"mayonnaise\\" being the final word in \\"Trout Fishing in America.\\" This system groups books under broad headings like Family, Health and Spirituality. The list of subjects concludes with All the Rest. Empty mayonnaise jars are the bookends.   The costs have been minimal: $10,000 borrowed to cover rent and buy a binding machine. Donations have totaled $700, Mr. Lockwood said. Donna Ohl Allen of Chester, Vt., was one of the first eight authors to submit a manuscript, her personal account of the 13 years that she and her South African husband spent in South Africa. She is pleased that her story will be in a public library.   \\"It's a story worth telling, a side of life in South Africa that people in this country don't know much about,\\" she said. \\"It's quite a satisfaction to have it put in a permanent collection where others can read it.\\"   Verbena Pastor, submitted a collection of six mysteries set in Northern Italy in 1943 and solved by an Italian policeman working with a German Army officer.   John and William Dodge, brothers from Montreal, sent a collection of poetry about seafarers in the Maritime Provinces of Canada.   Mr. Lockwood allows the possibility that publishers may come looking for publishable work. But he added: \\"It is important to understand that we are not so much interested in works getting published as we are in sharing ideas. One woman who was looking around remarked to me that this library is not about publishing or books, but about people telling their stories. And she was right.\\" Burlington Journal;   A Library For People With Tales To Tell"},{"year":"1965","title":"Maria Bourdova, the Russian woman-driver of trotters, who was barred by the Societe du Cheval Francais from competing in the recent Prix d'Amerique at Vincennes, would be permitted to drive in international competition here -- if and when.

When heading up the dirt drive to the large white clapboard farmhouse, it would also be easy to feel a bit like an intruder, especially for an urban visitor. But all it takes is one look at Nora Miller's spread: a table filled with thick-crusted loaves of tall white bread cooling in their plastic wrappers, rounds of fat and sticky cinnamon buns and peach, apple and blackberry pies lined up in a neat row, and any awkwardness is quickly forgotten.   Miller's Amish Farm Bakery is a one-person operation. Nora Miller is up before dawn on Friday and Saturday mornings in order to bake enough to fill her sunporch table for the two days of sales. Her specialty: pies. Her crusts are thick and flaky","excerpt":"all of her fruit fillings are lightly flavored with spices - the peach as well as apple tastes of nutmeg and cinnamon. While she prefers to use fresh picked fruit, during the winter months she turns to her cupboards for apples and peaches that she had canned the year before.   While much of the clientele here is made up of Amish friends and neighbors, a handful of regulars make the trip from Cleveland's suburbs. They come looking for something that these days seems more than a little nostalgic: good, simple home cooking. All of Mrs. Miller's fruit pies, white and whole wheat breads and breakfast and dinner rolls are made from recipes shared among family and neighbors.   A keen-eyed visitor driving the backroads and state highways in Geauga County, about 15 miles east of Cleveland, and Holmes County, about 60 miles south of Cleveland - where most of Ohio's Amish have settled - can discover many small farm bakeries, some open on weekdays and some just Friday and Saturday, but none open on Sunday.   For the less intrepid, fresh-baked goods and home cooking can also be found at Amish-run restaurants like Mary Yoder's in downtown Middlefield east of Cleveland and Troyer's Homestead Restaurant in Charm southwest of Canton. At Yoder's, suppers of fried chicken, roast beef and ham are served with potatoes, vegetables and cole slaw, family style in large serving dishes filled to the brim. A popular dessert is date pudding, a fluffy sweet combination of dates and sugar served under a brown sugar and butter sauce and topped with whipped cream or ice cream. At Troyer's, daily plate specials include meat loaf, baked ham or fish served with potato and another side dish of salad or vegetable. And the dessert menu includes a German chocolate pie made with coconut and pecans and grandma's graham cracker pudding, another confection of custard served with layers of banana and graham cracker and topped with whipped cream.

In \\"Ann Carver's Profession,\\" the problem comes up for debate once more, but a little less vital and a good deal less important than before. The new film manages to do a rather thorough job of running through the old dramatic landmarks for this type of story. It is all there, the resentful husband, the successful wife, the reluctant separation, the wife's torment, the husband's unhappy infidelities","excerpt":"all of it, up to and including the final scene in which Miss Carver concedes that the home is a career and that the bar will have to get along without her.The story is told with some skill and the acting of Fay Wray and Gene Raymond frequently gives emphasis and some emotional impact to the changing domestic fortunes of two young persons who are very much in love with one another. But almost everything in \\"Ann Carver's Profession\\" is too predictable for comfort, and it makes a generally dull entertainment.When Bill Graham and Ann Carver, newly married and fresh from a college romance, first take up the question of Ann's ambition to practice law, it all looks remarkably simple. Bill is a rising young architect with prospects. Ann is going to work simply because she is tired of sticking around the house. But Bill reaches a snag in his career, and Ann after several brilliantly managed cases becomes the city's most famous woman lawyer. Smarting under the sting of his wife's success, Bill becomes a crooner in a night club to increase his earnings. That precipitates a crisis which is not solved until Ann defends Bill in a sensational murder case and at its conclusion announces her retirement.The lesser players—Claire Dodd as a dipsomanic flirt. Claude Gillingwater as a wise, old lawyer; Frank Albertson as a brisk young orchestra leader, and Arthur Pierson as a legal friend of Ann's—are of considerable help.

Mr. McQueen makes his return to the screen after too long a hiatus, as he moves sternly and gracefully through the role of a former frontiersman who can't make his peace with the new gentility of the old West. The film itself is schematic and often slow, and nothing else about it has the idiosyncratic fire of Mr. McQueen's performance. But its slack stretches are fairly negligible, and the best episodes are worth waiting for.The director, William Wiard, has an exhausting fondness for sunsets, and a predilection for fancy effects he can't quite manage","excerpt":"all of the film's more ambitiously eye-catching moments wind up calling undue attention to themselves. The setting for \\"Tom Horn,\\" which opens today at the New York I and other theaters, is an enormous, mountain-ringed plain, and the film begins as Mr. McQueen rides into this lovely locale, casting a tall shadow and so forth.He is quickly established as an Indian tracker whose legend precedes him, and as a man who approaches trouble with a wry confidence. No sooner has he arrived in town than Gentleman Jim Corbett, the prizefighter, challenges him to a bout. Tom Horn sounds dubious, and asks, \\"If I win this fight, then am I the champion of the world?\\"\\"You're not big enough,\\" says Gentleman Jim.\\"Well then, what're you pickin' on a little feller like me for?\\" Horn inquires.The movie turns dull and shapeless during a long portion about Horn's career foiling rustlers; he is hired by one of the town's foremost ranchers, played sturdily by Richard Farnsworth, to protect cattle. Eventually, Horn falls in love with a stunning schoolmarm (played by Linda Evans) and is framed for a murder, events neither Mr. Wiard's direction nor the wisecracking screenplay (by Thomas McGuane and Bud Shrake) can comfortably connect. Horn, who has been incarcerated once before, long ago — \\"for invasion of Mexico,\\" he explains — is jailed and tried. \\"They say he's runnin' for office again, and if he convicts you, he'll be a big hero,\\" someone says of the prosecutor. \\"He needs to hang you to get elected.\\"The year is 1903, and Tom Horn is part of a dying breed and knows it. Mr. McQueen lends Horn a grace and resignation that stay understated even when the film turns clumsily emphatic. And the sadness he brings to the role is quietly, effectively pervasive. He seems at once on a grander and smaller scale than the rest of the movie, offering tiny, pared-down gestures against those grand landscapes. And even when the film's relative ordinariness does little to aggrandize his character, he rises to heroic stature.

In \\"To the Last Man,\\" which is emblazoned in a ???hadowy way this week upon the Rialto screen, they have based the production upon the usual idea, injecting into the ???lm a sequence much the same as the big dramatic incident in \\"The Girl of the Golden West.\\" In the latter there was the gambling Sheriff upon whose ???ainty cambric handkerchief fell drops ???of blood from the wounded man above. ???n \\"To the Last Man\\" a discovery of the hiding place of the hero is made through blood upon the ladder-rungs. First the heroine finds the blood, and ???en one of the villains, after handling the girl in a very rough manner, observes the red stains upon her hand. ???e is a pretty good detective, for the ???nstant he sees the crimson on the palm ???f the girl's hand he goes to the ladder, looks up and seems to remember what happened in \\"The Girl of the Golden West,\\" and forthwith scents that the hero is concealing himself somewhere in the loft.The girl, Ellen Jorth, played by ???ois Wilson, meets Jean Isbel, one of the men of the rival family. Eventually she hates him, and when Jean leaves ??? present at their trysting place, Ellen, ??? show her contempt for the Isbels. ???nd Jean in particular, kicks the package all the way home. There is plenty of shooting and fighting in this picture. It has to be this way to live up to the ???tle, for one is aware that in the end only Richard Dix, who plays Jean, must be in the land of the living, ready for the forgiveness of the heroine.So one after another each male member of the two families is shot off—and paid off. Where guns are not used for the slaughter, knives come into play, because they do not make as much noise. It is only by the merest chance, and possibly at the command of the director, that Ellen does not slay Jean. She looks at the gun long enough, and ???as every opportunity to pot him off, but weakens. After \\"waning afternoon and lengthening shadows,\\" Jean ???ood-naturedly believes something has prevented Ellen from keeping her usual appointment.The gun-play keeps the drummer in the Rialto on the alert, making the sounds for the cracking rifles. First an ???bel child is shot by the cowardly ???orths, and then Gaston Isbel is betrayed after his challenge has been accepted by Lee Jorth. So the murdering ???arts, and Noah Beery and another than are left to hold up the notorious ???orths. The constant flashing of guns has inspired the photographer himself to make some excellent \\"shots,\\" the only relief from the monotony of the shel-Jorth squabbles.Richard Dix, and occasionally the other male players, resort to posing, realizing evidently that this is a picture for fighting men. One posture by Dix looked very much like Walter Ha???en's footwork at the end of a 250-yard drive. It's all right on the tee, but a ???rifle filmy on a mountain road. Dix probably felt a bit swanky after all the ???en he had licked and killed.Once in the hay-mow the hero is able to take notice, but because he has been ???hot through the arm he can't sit up. Below, that brute Colter has Ellen at ???is mercy. Colter clutches at the sleeve ???f Ellen's crudely made dress—and off ???omes the whole sleeve. The director was ??? the job that time, you see. Then ???ter and Ellen, under the peeping eye of the wounded Jean, sway back and ???orth in one of those motion picture rights between man and woman.Lois Wilson is as good as can be expected in this film, and Noah Beery as ???olter is convincing. In fact, the only persons who carries to extremes his screen knowledge is Dix. This is one of those pictures that give one a fit of yawning, and as darkness reigns in the theatre one does not even have to ???her to put one's hand before the offending mouth. There were quite a number of yawns in the Rialto yesterday.

Mr. Walter, who graduated from North Texas State University and teaches now at Indiana State, is as practiced a manipulator of the woody-sounding marimba and the vibraphone, with its curiously artificial, metallic oscillations of pitch, as anyone this critic has encountered in the Classical-music realm.   The trouble with his recital was that there simply isn't the depth of Classical repertory to allow him to avoid stocking his program with gimmicky transcriptions. This he proceded blithely to do, with all the transcribing - of music by Poulenc, Bartok, Castelnuovo-Tedesco and Falla - by himself. Mr. Walter played up a storm, but the results sounded like something one might have encountered on the Ed Sullivan Show, following the dancing dogs and the family who spun plates with their noses.

Buchanan was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, primarily for his work in developing ''public choice theory,'' which has provided the intellectual underpinnings of the property tax revolt and the balanced-budget movement. In the following, excerpted from a 1979 article, Mr. Buchanan explains the public choice analysis of how representative democracy and government bureaucracy have distorted economic policy and, in the process, created a constitutional crisis in the industrialized democracies.    ONCE we move beyond town-meeting democracy to representative democracy, we must introduce the possible divergence between the interests of the representative or agent who is elected or appointed to act for the group and the interests of the group members themselves.   It is at this point that electoral competition, as an institution, plays a role that has some similarities with that played by market competition in the economy. Persons or parties that seek to represent the interests of voters compete for approval or favor much in the manner as do the sellers of products in imperfectly competitive markets for private goods and services. But politics differs categorically from markets in that, in political competition, there are mutually exclusive sets of losers and winners. Only one candidate or party wins","excerpt":"all others lose. Only one party is the governing party.
