It would be crazy if we all tried to sleep together, because Holly has four dogs that stay in our bed, Bridget has a dog and a cat, and Kendra has two dogs.

PJ Max"},{"year":"1991","title":"I vividly recall my flight into New York in 1954, at age 26, as Minolta's first representative in the United States. Night was falling, and I could see a bluish glow spreading over the city from its neon heart, Times Square. It was a stark contrast to my Japanese homeland, which was still so poor that, even in Tokyo, electricity was rationed and lights burned feebly for only a few hours each night. Tokyo's prewar commercial center, the Ginza, was only then beginning to recover from the devastation of World War II.    I find myself remembering that night whenever I hear Americans decry Japan's economic \\"invasion\\" of the United States. My experience suggests that, financial motivations notwithstanding, the Japanese interest in things American is much more complex than many people in the United States might suspect.    Shortly after the war, I had the humbling experience of walking through the Ginza. Sidewalk peddlers had replaced the famous, now bombed-out, stores. And American military police, filling in for destroyed traffic lights, directed the flow of cars from a raised platform in the center of the main intersection.    The tall, handsome and healthy GI's, wearing crisp olive uniforms with brilliant white helmets, took turns directing traffic with choreographic flair. Young Japanese women admired the style and authority of those Americans, then cast sidelong glances at underfed Japanese men like me, who waited to cross the street with bowed heads and shabby clothes, jealous of the Americans, knowing we could not compete. The seeds of Japan's postwar recovery may have been sown there in the Ginza in 1946.    America's generosity ran far deeper than gifts of nylon stockings to the young women. During the six-and-a-half years following Japan's surrender, the economic help and political liberalization the United States provided under Gen. Douglas MacArthur's rule enabled my country to revive its economy, and the confidence that our ill-advised war had shattered.    Minolta, where I went to work not long out of Keio University, benefited from MacArthur's determination to rebuild domestic industries - and, in the case of camera manufacturers, the general's desire to give his soldiers something to spend money on besides booze, gambling and skirt-chasing. In effect, our sales to the military post exchanges were our first \\"exports.\\"    Growing up in the late 1920's and early 30's in what was then the Japanese city of Korea, I developed a great admiration for America. My father, the Ford Motor Company's distributor for the entire colony, was known as \\"the Henry Ford of Korea.\\"    When I was sent to the United States in the '50's, my mandate was to expand Minolta's sales to the world's richest customer market. And, as I made my way in New York, I struck up friendships with other young Japanese men here on similar missions from other Tokyo- and Osaka-based employers.  We didn't have much money and we whiled away many an evening in the Times Square area. I marveled at the block-long Bond clothing store sign with its flowing waterfall flanked by giant statues of a man and a woman, the replica of a T.W.A. airliner with wings outstretched over Seventh Avenue, and my favorite, the Camel cigarette sign with a man blowing smoke rings.    Times Square had begun to go dark by the time I was sent back to the United States to be president of the marketing subsidiary in 1969. Broadway's fading lights were symptomatic of the deterioration of New York City in those years","excerpt":"by the 1970's, the night sky over Tokyo was brighter than New York's. The story of what happened next may illuminate, if you will, the controversy surrounding recent Japanese investment in America.    In my conversations with other Japanese businessmen in New York, I discovered that many of us shared similar career paths and a nostalgic attachment to Manhattan. We struck a gentlemen's agreement to relight Times Square.    We considered giant neon signs a good advertising medium and believed Times Square to be perhaps the best location in the United States. Our companies were doing well, thanks to the openness of the American market and the buying power of American consumers; what better way to symbolize our achievements in that market than to revive one of its vernacular art forms.    Sony was first, with its giant sign at the south end of the square in 1972. Fuji, TDK and others followed. There were more than a dozen Japanese companies represented at Times Square by the time Minolta, in 1983, secured the northern facade of 1 Times Square Plaza.    Since 1907, this building, which once housed the New York Times, has been the site of the annual dropping of the giant ball at midnight on New Year's Eve. Our sign's Broadway premiere was, up to then, the only time other than New Year's Eve that the ball had been lowered from the tower. One magazine headline announced, \\"Japanese Invade Times Square,\\" and a newspaper attacked us for \\"commercializing\\" the New Year's Eve tradition.    It wasn't as if we were driving the Americans out. The American advertisers had largely deserted Times Square. In fact, following the Japanese \\"invasion,\\" American firms like Pepsi, Kodak and others - including Camel cigarettes - returned to Times Square with dazzling signs.    I think about that when I read the headlines about the \\"invading\\" Japanese. American investment has benefited the economies of many countries. As the United States now wrestles with a recession, I hope more Americans will welcome investments that foster growth. I've learned from experience that foreign investments can help to keep the lights burning. Not just im Times Square and the Ginza, but all around the world. Japanese Enlightenment"},{"year":"1994","title":"MODERN ARCHITEC- ture, it is sometimes said, took a wrong turn in the years after World War II. A movement that had started out in the 1920's with an idealistic agenda for social change had transformed itself into the slick style of American corporate culture. But there was a time when the modern movement and corporate America were not thought to be opposed in their aims. From the late 1940's to the early 1960's, the industrialist and the designer were commonly viewed as partners, allies in the pursuit of humane goals. General Electric and the disciples of the Bauhaus were of one mind in supposing that progress was the 20th century's most important product.   And for those who grew up imbibing the atmosphere of those years, modernism's \\"wrong turn\\" made for memories that remain extraordinarily potent. Those images of late modernism are now resurfacing, as architects born in the postwar decades ease into the productive phase of their careers. For these architects, a full generation younger than those who formulated the post-modern framework, the modern movement is not the esthetic equivalent of a father figure crying out for Oedipal assault. It more nearly resembles a lost paradise, a mechanical Eden from which contemporary society has been rudely expelled.    These younger professionals spent their childhoods in the golden age of \\"The Affluent Society,\\" the optimistic era that adopted the stripped-down, glass-walled International style as a conspicuous sign of prosperity at home and global influence abroad. In contrast to the socialist utopia envisioned by the modern movement's European pioneers, this was marketplace modernism, American-made and proud of it. The messianic fervor of the early 20th century's architectural manifestoes had given way to the visceral thrill of physical realization. \\"Let us rebuild everything,\\" Le Corbusier declared in the 1920's","excerpt":"by the 50's, that declaration had led to tangible results, with buildings that reshaped the way people looked at the landscape, at art, at city streets, at the workplace and at the home.   The period was rich in individual buildings of great merit, such as Lever House and the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, and the Case Study houses, a series of modern prototypes designed by a variety of architects and built in and around Los Angeles in the postwar years. These designs carried the ideal of experimentation forward into practical application. Each of them showed how new materials, new methods of construction and new visual and spatial relationships could produce new perspectives on familiar places and institutions.   But these examples, remarkable as they were, were also episodes in a larger story: the broadening of an avant-garde esthetic into the cultural mainstream. Modernism at mid-century was still part of the canon of educated taste. Along with abstract painting, atonal music and new wave film, it held its place in the curriculum of cultural sophistication. And the commercial victory of modern design pointed toward the possibility that a cherished liberal ideal might soon be attained. An equilibrium could be struck between educated taste and the mass market. After all, executives at the Four Seasons and office workers at Zum Zum lunched in the same design universe. What was to prevent the expansion of the egalitarian spirit to the culture at large? Wouldn't a rising tide lift all art forms?   THOUGH MODERNISM had become the academy, it was still a young academy. And its output was powerfully appealing to young minds. The shiny newness of modern buildings, so like a mechanical birthday toy. The gadget fascination of functionalism. The magic disappearing act performed by walls that dissolved into glass or into the unstructured interior of the open floor plan. Above all, perhaps, there was the narcissistic pleasure that flowed to the young from the prevailing postwar idea that all this was being done for them -- for the future. All the glass towers, the superhighways, even the rocket ships so glowingly described by Werner von Braun on \\"Man in Space,\\" a late 50's Walt Disney television program: These revolutionary designs had been created for the race of gilded children who would never know the Depression except as a tale told to foster gratitude for the abundant fruits of progress.   To be born into this environment was to be doubly privileged, or perhaps cursed: to mistake the privilege as a birthright, a natural order of things. And, for a brief moment, before the 60's turned into \\"The Sixties,\\" the young had one foot in the ionosphere of infinite possibility that modernism had spread before it. The future was here, or perhaps just a short flight away on an Eastern Airlines Whisperjet, an icon of the 60's with its crisp white fuselage trimmed with blue stripes and black sans-serif type, its flight attendants dressed in Jacqueline Kennedy-style outfits, its image explicitly marketed to youth with the jaunty blue-and-white youth-fare card. Beyond, the whole world beckoned, like the stylized globe on the Pan Am flight bag, another mesmerizing symbol of the blue and white life (before metal detectors): the dream of drifting through cloud and sky toward endless happy landings.   AND THEN THE dream crashed. A movement that had started out in opposition to the status quo found itself under attack for having become it. Instead of resembling an enlightened coalition between art and industry, modernism came to seem like a mindless juggernaut with designs on everything in sight. The idea that modernism was historically inevitable, a claim often put forward by the movement's advocates, now seemed like the best possible reason to resist it. The idealistic globalism of the International style had become indistinguishable from the threat of imperial overreach.  The blue and white life was no longer so pure when bombers began streaking across Southeast Asian skies. The machine in the garden was apparently killing off all the plants.   This about-face in perception demanded something more than simply modifying modern principles. Rather, the principles themselves had to be rejected, as if the entire movement had fallen prey to the market law of planned obsolescence. And, in a sense, it had. The pact with industry turned out to be somewhat Faustian. The pioneer figures of modernism were gone, and with them the movement's creative spark. Consumption, not creation, had become design's dominant force; novelty and change, its governing principles.   TO AN EXTENT, MARKET forces are also responsible for reviving the aura of modern design. \\"New Modernism\\" as a concept fits neatly into the theme of \\"return\\" that has been a marketing motif for two decades. At the same time, the modern aura appeals to architects who are looking for fundamentalist principles that can redeem architecture from market tyranny. The expression of structure, the paring away of ornament, the reduction of space to eloquent void: Once again, these concepts are seen to deliver design from the superficial whimsies of image, stagecraft and style. There are also those who concur with the German philosopher Jurgen Habermas that modernity is \\"an incomplete project,\\" that architects should not abandon modernism's overarching ideal of reason, even if society can do no more than reach fumblingly toward it.   The prospect of a modernist revival is not likely to delight those who believe that architecture has gained from the awareness of history promoted by the post-modern movement. Actually, today's reappraisal of modernism is partly the result of that movement.  For with the deepening of historical awareness has come the understanding that modernism was not a radical break with the past. Rather, it was a flowering of ideas that had been germinating in Western civilization since the Enlightenment. What is driving architects toward modernism today is a fusion of personal and cultural memory: a desire to reconnect with a time in their lives and a moment in architecture that were both suffused with radiant promise.

What emerged was a reconstruction of the interior spirit of recent Romanian history. When the play begins, before the revolution, the characters talk softly while the radio blares","excerpt":"by the end, they are talking loudly and not listening to one another.    \\"Mad Forest,\\" a production of the New York Theater Workshop, which opens with an American cast on Wednesday at the Perry Street Theater, emerged from an unusual project engineered by Mark Wing-Davey, the play's director. Mr. Wing-Davey is a former actor with the Joint Stock Theater Company, a British troupe whose performers sometimes try to live a slice of real life before fictionalizing it on stage. (\\"Mad Forest\\" was ultimately mounted by the Royal Court Theater in London.)   In March 1990, just three months after the fall and execution of the Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu, Mr. Wing-Davey traveled to Romania with Ms. Churchill and 10 acting students from the Central School of Speech and Drama, where he was then artistic director. In Romania, working with about 40 local counterparts, the British troupe fanned out to find the ordinary people caught up in events. They interviewed them and then portrayed them as characters in front of the group, while Ms. Churchill took notes.

And when one considers that these fashions are not only British but old, it should be fairly apparent that little more need be said of the film.One might note in passing, however, that the gaiety supposedly conveyed in this nauseously Technicolored flimflam derives from a dreary little tale of a playboy's reckless involvement in what is archly called \\"haute couture\\"that is, by the characters who adorn it","excerpt":"by the others, it is called the \\"rag trade.\\" And with Michael Wilding as this fellow and Miss Neagle as the manager of his shop, the sport consists mostly in his making silly faces and flat jokes, at which Miss Neagle giggles and says, \\"You're quite incorrigible!\\"There is also some dismal business in which Peter Graves and Nicholas Phipps pretend to be elegant clubmen mixed up in \\"haute couture.\\" And there are two embarassing sequences in which Miss Neagle throws herself into the dance.

Written and directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini (R, 105 minutes). ''From off the streets of Cleveland comes 'American Splendor,' '' screams the cover of every issue of the writer Harvey Pekar's surly and open-eyed autobiographical comic book series. The towering, action-packed logo is a further sardonic comment on the lack of activity in the protagonist's life. There's as much at stake in this hilarious, moody and cantankerous film adaptation of ''Splendor'' as there was in this summer's other movies of comic antiheroes like ''The Hulk'' and ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.'' Harvey is extraordinary","excerpt":"by the way, so is this movie. As played by Mr. Giamatti, Harvey is a gray wad of anger who spends his time in his cavelike apartment, with shelves sagging under the weight of his collection of record albums and jazz 78's. The filmmakers use the real Mr. Pekar as a narrator initially. For a time the film cuts to the real-life Pekar, fulminating on screen with his friends against a stark-white background. This sounds like a mocking, distancing device, and in the wrong hands it would be. But the real-life Pekar is as vivid in his way as Mr. Giamatti. Harvey's romantic match, Joyce Brabner, is played by Ms. Davis with a tart, intriguing directness that's equal parts Emma Goldman and Olive Oyl. And the picture becomes something richer and fuller when Joyce enters the film. Harvey has someone to square off with, and her eccentricities complement his (Elvis Mitchell).

The belief that the nonskilled worker is doomed may be premature.  The computer should be able to carry out so many complex functions that certain jobs may become more, not less, accessible to the person with little training or education, especially if computers of the future are easy to use. Another current notion - that the humanities will be obsolete as a job-creating background - may also be a myth: the world will still need policy makers, educators, artists and administrators.   These are the views of experts around the nation who are projecting employment patterns and job skill needs for the 21st century.

WHAT JOBS WILL BE OUT THERE IN 2001?"},{"year":"1934","title":"A rapid-fire mystery, suspenseful and jammed with thrills, is \\"Menace,\\" which opened last night at the Rialto. Based on a story by Philip MacDonald, who has a habit of turning out superior thrillers, it ranks several notches higher than the average murder film and should be welcomed by even the casual followers of cinema tales of threats, panic and sudden death.The picture jumps off to an interesting start with a scene in British East Africa. Colonel Crecy, Norman Bellamy and Helen Chalmers, trying to drum up a fourth at bridge, plead with a young mining engineer, Freddie Bastion, to forget his dam for a while and join them. Bastion takes a plane from his construction camp. An African rainstorm comes up, the dam bursts and Bastion, flying back to late, sees his sisters' bungalow swept away by the torrent. He commits suicide.Shortly after, the three who lured Bastion from his work and were, in a way, responsible for his death, received threats from his insane brother. Before he can execute his sentence of death, however, the brother is committed to an asylum. Two years later he escapes and the three doomed persons find themselves, under the lash of terror, at Miss Chalmers's home in Santa Barbara.They are joined there, much against their inclination, by a new butler","excerpt":"by the young man Miss Chalmers's sister has just met; by a talkative matron with another strange young man. The last warning from the madman told them he would \\"strike tonight\\"; the note, pinned under an ivory-handled dagger, reveals that he is actually in the house.From that moment on it is any one's tragedy, and the Rialto audience buzzed with conflicting identifications of \\"he's the one.\\" Mr. MacDonald has played fair: the murderer is among the guests. Your guess will be as good as any.And, as a final word, the acting—like the story—is better than that normally encountered in mystery films. Gertrude Michael and Paul Cavanagh, last seen together in \\"The Notorious Sophie Lang,\\" are an excellent acting combination.

The orgy of vocalism was celebrated for close to eight hours with little interruption. Everybody was there.   It took Miss Battle no more than three Purcell songs to justify the enthusiasm her singing has aroused. ''There's Not a Swain on the Plain'' showed how she can let her voice sound in turn eager, crestfallen, agitated, tearful and lovingly reproachful, all without seeming to impose a calculated nuance on it.

How representative are they of black clergymen? And just why is there a black church -- one of the most segregated institutions in America? There was a time DeForest L. Raphael thought the black church was irrevelant. He changed his mind, was ordained in 1975 and today is pastor of the Institutional African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Yonkers, a position he has held since July. Before then he was pastor at the Park Street A.M.E. Zion Church in Peekskill.\\n\\nHere are excerpts from a recent conversation with him about the role of the black church in America.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. How does a predominently black church differ from a predominently white church?\\n\\n\\nA. Not having been in the white church, I'm at a bit of a disadvantage. But there are some of the same differences we would find between members of the African-American community and the white community. White churches tend to be more affluent. A lot of the larger churches have large incomes or endowments, so they can manage even when their weekly donations and other ventures don't carry them through monetarily. Probably some of the social concerns are different between black and white churches. White churches have tended to be a little bit more staid, conservative. Black churches are at once the most radical and the most conservative insitutions in the black community.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. How do you explain that paradox?\\n\\n\\nA. By conservative I mean they tend to be the most stable institutions in the community, with members who have been there for a long time. Whether struggling economically or well to do, these people are not inclined to be radical. I'm thinking as a child of the 60's. There was a time I used to think of the black church as irrelevant. The older I got, the more relevant the church got -- not altogether unlike how I used to think my parents were stupid and as I got older they, amazingly, got more intelligent. So on the one hand, these members are very conservative in terms of movement.\\n\\nBut on the other hand, the church has been the spawning ground for some of our greatest leaders: Martin Luther King, Malcolm X. I would include Malcolm, although he was not a Christian but a Muslim, because he still had the ethos of the black church in him in his cadence and his preaching that made him at the forefront of leadership. So that is the dichotomy of the black church. There is this conservative element, but there is also this drive toward freedom and greater participation in a larger society. And it is the only institution we control completely from stem to stern and can direct in any way we feel we want to. \\n\\n\\n\\nQ. Whites can join black churches and vice versa, can't they? How did the black church evolve?\\n\\n\\nA. Yes, we had some white members at the Peekskill church. But the A.M.E. Zion Church was born out of a discriminatory struggle with the church. Back in 1796, we were members of what was then and is still the John Street Methodist Church of Lower Manhattan. We were forced to take communion at different times from white members, and there was no respect for the black clergyman. Blacks had to sit in segregated sections of the church. We decided we were not going to put up with that, so we left and founded our own church.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. Do you think in these modern times the separation of churches is good or bad?\\n\\n\\nA. It has its positives and its negatives. In a positive vein, there is certainly what one might tend to believe is-- though this might not necessarily be the case -- an opportunity for freer expression. The minister may want to deal with issues of race, and he may not feel free to do it if there are a large number of whites in his congregation. Yet there are black ministers in the United Methodist Church who have a larger white membership. The separation is negative in that, as stated by Malcom X, the most segregated time in America is Sunday morning 11 o'clock worship service. We then have this \\"we versus them\\" thing that is tearing at the fabric of our society. \\n\\n\\n\\nQ. And people tend to socialize after church, so therefore it is with people of their own color?\\n\\n\\nA. Yes. So what you as a minister do is make a concerted effort to stretch out and meet other congregations. But sometimes this doesn't happen until there is a crisis situation and then after the crisis is over, we all kind of go back to our own communities.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. Is this because people tend to feel more comfortable with people like themselves?\\n\\n\\nA. That might be part of it. We've a long way to go. America is an experiment only 200 years old. It doesn't have to work, but if it is going to work, it will be because all people have been given an equal opportunity. It doesn't necessarily mean set-asides, although what we have now is set-asides in a sense. Quota systems are only bad when they end up talking about members of the African-American community. But the quota system is what we call, loosely, the old boys network. If that's not a quota system, I don't know what is. \\n\\n\\n\\nQ. How political do you see your role? Would you pattern yourself after Mr. Jackson?\\n\\n\\nA. What Jesse has done is on a large scale articulate issues that need to be articulated on the large level. I think that everything that we do in our church has a political edge to it. Many of our elected officials have been people who have been ministers, who come out of the black church experience, who have been emboldened by the black church experience. Elected office is not anything I've ever been seeking, but people need to be aware of the process.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. Would you expect to push against the re-election of Senator D'Amato, who did not vote to override the President's veto of the proposed civil rights law?\\n\\n\\nA. I would love -- for all kinds of reasons, not just because of that particular vote -- to push for his defeat. I'm not surprised he voted that way. I would like to rally not just against Al D'Amato, but against the kind of point of view that feels it's O.K. to use the worst kinds of barroom instincts to turn people against each other","excerpt":"by trying to whip up fear so people vote against someone and something, not because of any merit but because of that kind of fear. \\n\\n\\n\\nQ. How much influence does a black minister have?\\n\\n\\nA. I guess it depends. I think that the black church has been more of an activist church than the white church. But there have been black ministers who have not been at all activists in their outlook and their ministry. Certainly anyone who is going to deal effectively with the issues that face America and face their congregation must be in touch with the \\"real world.\\" I think it's important that we become active and activate. \\n\\n\\n\\nQ. So many black men are in trouble with the law. What can you, as a minister, do to help change this?\\n\\n\\nA. First, to develop alternatives for young people, and then to articulate them. There is a kind of hopelessness and helplessness that has evolved, where some see as their only outlet crime or to join the Army. There are very few alternatives. When I grew up, there were many, many more alternatives. Around me were black people who were lawyers, teachers, doctors. Now, particularly in the inner city, there are fewer role models. The children tend to lean toward the ones who gain the most notoriety. Too often in our communities drugs prevail. \\n\\n\\n\\nQ. How do you change this?\\n\\n\\nA. What you do to change this is to bring children in to show them there is another way. There may be a number of children we have lost, but we can do something about making sure we don't lose another generation. The church needs to become much more actively involved in teaching its children what they need to know about the rich history that predates our slavery experience. In terms of how long we've been on this planet, the slave experience was a relatively short one. We can't let that determine who we are.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. What do you think of Mr. Sharpton?\\n\\n\\nA. I think some of the problem people have with him are esthetic problems -- the picture of the bloated preacher with the processed hair. But substantively, Al keeps before people, regardless of what people want to say about him, issues that need to be kept before the public. And if someone like Al Sharpton weren't doing it, unfortunately, it would not be getting the kind of attention that it has. I've met him only one or two times. \\n\\nWithout going into all the allegations people have made about his role in various cases, I think he has been a person who has articulated issues that need to be articulated. There are other black ministers who could speak more eloquently than he does. But the media has seized upon Al Sharpton as one of the few spokesmen for the black community. \\n\\nI think this is because there is a perceived uneasiness in the black community about Al Sharpton. So the media and the larger white establishment that has, at best, displayed benign hostility to the aspirations of the black community, seize on an Al Sharpton and show him in whatever negative ways they can in an attempt to divide the black community. This is what was done with the differences between Dr. King and Malcolm X.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. Are you comparing Mr.Sharpton to Dr. King or to Malcolm X?\\n\\n\\nA. No. Not in substance or in stature. Just in the common attempt to keep the black community divided. WESTCHESTER Q&A;: THE REV. DEFOREST L.

THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER & CLAY, by Michael Chabon. (Random House, $26.95.) A generous, optimistic, inventive and ambitious comic novel, set in the golden age of comic books (late 1930's to early 50's) and thematically permeated by two ideas: escape (from Nazism, from Brooklyn) and the mystery of the golem of Prague.    QUARREL & QUANDARY: Essays, by Cynthia Ozick. (Knopf, $25.) Accomplished, graceful work that began as reviews and higher journalism by an accomplished stylist who possesses, and offers in these essays to preserve, a moral gravity based on a literary education that is not much on offer anymore.    THE TALMUD AND THE INTERNET: A Journey Between Worlds, by Jonathan Rosen. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16.) A thought-provoking essay on two information systems, both of which are full of unforeseen linkages and contain all knowledge, if you know how to find it.    WHEN WE WERE ORPHANS, by Kazuo Ishiguro. (Knopf, $25.) A novel that conceals great issues of identity and self-knowledge behind the facade of a detective story; its protagonist, a private eye in 1920's London, uses all his wits in the cause of deceiving himself, missing the call of freedom in the blindness his sense of obligation imposes.

EINSTEIN IN LOVE: A Scientific Romance, by Dennis Overbye. (Viking, $27.95.) An antiromance, really, in which Overbye, the deputy science editor of The Times, applies recent discoveries about Einstein to examine both his scientific work and his emotional life; in the end, he portrays the great scientist as a rat with women and an irresponsible father.

THE INFORMANT: A True Story, by Kurt Eichenwald. (Broadway, $26.)

THE UNEXPECTED LEGACY OF DIVORCE: A 25 Year Landmark Study, by Judith Wallerstein, Julia Lewis and Sandra Blakeslee. (Hyperion, $24.95.)

I use the phrase ''roughly speaking'' advisedly, because Mr. Reynolds's play eventually begins to speak - and to behave - very roughly indeed, especially for a piece that first presents itself as lightminded parody. Furthermore, the kind of moviemaking that is getting its head kicked in here has nothing to do with Hollywood sound stages or the West Coast's oldfashioned ways. It has to do with the much newer fashion of going halfway around the world (in this case to the Philippines) to make portentously titled spectacles (in this case ''Parabola of Death'') about suitably catastrophic events (in this case ''war in Angola'') complete with helicopters, typhoons that tear down half the scenery and directors with three names (in this case Milo McGee McGarr).

He therefore made a motion picture about a film director who could not come up with an idea for a motion picture. The result was known as ''8 1/2,'' with the '' 1/2'' meant to indicate that something was missing.

The Arts Festival","excerpt":"By Writing What Pleases His Ear, Lutoslawski Pleases His Audience"},{"year":"1995","title":"Nasdaq Is on the Ropes    Nasdaq suffered a one-two-three punch. First, a left jab from two professors who released a study in May showing that 25-cent spreads were the norm on the Nasdaq stock trading system, while 12.5-cent spreads were the norm for the big exchanges. (Brokers make their money using spreads, which let them buy and sell at different prices. The larger the spread, the larger the fee.) Then, a right hook from plaintiffs in a wave of class-action lawsuits against the main market makers -- touched off by the professors' study, which Nasdaq said was flawed. And finally, an uppercut from the Justice Department, which said in October that it was investigating the dealers who make Nasdaq markets, the apparent focus being on a suspicion of price fixing. Joseph Jett's Fame as a Phantom    One way or another, it seems, Orlando Joseph Jett was bound to gain fame in 1994. Early in the year, the 36-year-old chief government bond trader at Kidder, Peabody (who goes by his middle name) was declared Employee of the Year -- and was rewarded with a $9 million bonus. But before summer, he was held out as a villain who is said to have exploited glitches in the brokerage firm's accounting systems to take credit for $350 million in phantom profits, or profits that existed only on paper. Kidder's parent, General Electric, quickly reduced previously reported profits by $210 million and then sold off the brokerage firm, all the while pointing to Mr. Jett. Later the New York Stock Exchange said it was punishing Mr. Jett -- he refused to testify before the exchange's enforcement division -- by banishing him from trading securities or working for any employer affiliated with the exchange. This has essentially barred him from Wall Street, which suffers from herd mentality, at least in this regard. (So far Mr. Jett, who has strongly denied any wrongdoing, is a phantom defendant: No charges have been filed in the complex case, which is being investigated by the S.E.C. and the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan and promises more drama this year.) Read at Your Own Risk    It only began creeping into the vernacular in the spring of 1994","excerpt":"by year-end, mention of the word could jangle the nerves of a wide set of investors. (WARNING: The following material is not recommended for readers with high blood pressure.) Derivatives. Derivatives -- financial instruments with values linked to some underlying asset like a bond, stock or index -- stung corporations like Gibson Greetings and Procter & Gamble, mutual funds run by Piper Jaffray and Paine Webber, and municipalities across the country. But nowhere was the failure of investment plans using some derivatives more dramatic than in Orange County, Calif. The county's risky plan, which also included heavy borrowing, led to the biggest municipal bankruptcy ever. Schoolchildren may get a chilling lesson in financial tomfoolery: the county's schools, which were required by state law to put their funds through the county's investment pool, may run out of money to pay salaries. A Lighter Load to the Bank    No need to enlist Brinks trucks to pick up bonuses this year, folks. Your Range Rovers will do. Goldman, Sachs, one of Wall Street's richest investment firms, prided itself on outdoing its rivals in past industry downturns. But not this time: Goldman is struggling to make money as are other firms that rely heavily on bond trading, including Lehman Brothers, Salomon Brothers and Bear, Stearns. They were all blind-sided by rising interest rates last year. Goldman's elite securities traders and investment bankers are seeing their discretionary bonuses chopped by as much as 75 percent. (In good years the bonuses can be several times their annual salaries, which are often in the high six figures, at least.) The firm had its first round of layoffs in years in 1994, and more are expected this year. Goldman's support staff is also seeing smaller bonuses; they are down to 8 percent from 30 percent a year ago. Prudential's Burgeoning Tab    What Prudential executives thought would be put behind them last year for a relatively small price of $330 million is still an albatross -- one that's costing the insurance giant at least twice as much. In the 1980's the company's Prudential Securities unit defrauded hundreds of thousands of investors who joined the limited partnerships it had set up and billed as safe. Small investors lost billions. Claims against the company's $660 million restitution fund are still flowing in: at the middle of last month, the number of filings was higher than ever. More than 56,000 claimants have already received $397 million, while more than 152,000 have filed claims. Filings can be made as late as a year from the postmark date on the forms Prudential began mailing a year ago this month. If the $660 million doesn't cut it, Prudential will have to pony up even more. Highlights"},{"year":"1988","title":"LEAD:  1919: The Year Our World Began. By William K. Klingaman.
