Even people who didn't see the film have seen its logotype - a ghost, under a red circle crossed by the diagonal slash that says Stop. This time, it's the logotype that lingers on. More than lingers: flourishes. It's turning out to be the most copied bit of iconography since we all learned how to H New York. The imitations of Ghostbusters are coming on like gangbusters.

Given such final emphasis on the appropriateness of the title, coming on the heels of many other reiterations of it, one is puzzled to find no mention of its significance -- most certainly an echo of T. S. Eliot -- for the subject of the book. At the beginning of Section II of ''Burnt Norton,'' first of the ''Four Quartets,'' Eliot writes, ''Garlic and sapphires in the mud / Clot the bedded axle-tree,'' an image that has baffled most readers and tested the mettle of many intrepid Eliot scholars.

It is partly because Ray is capable of infinite, or at least, so far, limitless, variations that he is invariably so fresh and refreshing. Almost all of his characters are fundamentally the same or closely akin, yet each is importantly original and different. To any one who enjoys the best in screen acting, with comedy subtle, human and real, Ray is a joy forever. And especially when, as now, he has a story that fits him as his own suit of clothes.It is often impossible to tell just who is responsible for a photoplay or any part of it, whether the scenarist, director or star, but when a story as a whole is consistently bright and all of its incidents, while exactly suited to the talent of its star, brings him into the narrative rather than break with him away from it, it is reasonable to assume that the author is really the one to whom authorship is ascribed. And in the present instance it is Agnes Christine Johnson, the pleasing quality of whose work in \\"Daddy Long Legs\\" and \\"Twenty-three and a Half Hours' Leave\\" has been noticed, but who, apparently, has had better opportunities and done more with them in \\"Alarm Clock Andy\\" than in any of her previous works—perhaps, because her present scenario is not an adaptation, but hers from the beginning.Above a general level of excellence there are special bits in the picture that seem typical examples of Miss Johnson's wit, and in them Ray is at his best—so in each there is a happy coincidence of talent. Nor must Jerome Storm be overlooked, for as Ray's director he has contributed much to former productions and undoubtedly would have been missed from the present one.Ray's latest rôle is that of a timid, stuttering young man who is the slave of an alarm clock, an office, a boarding house and a girl whom he worships from atar anonymously. He lives in a constant state of embarrassment, anxiety and apologetic intensity. Every one runs over him, and he lies down to be run over whenever anyone comes his way. But through a conjunction of incidents and influences he suddenly asserts himself and most emphatically is asserted. A succession of friendly accidents gives him a start, stimulated hope spurs him to efforts of his own, fortune continues her favors, and, in the end, like his brother Bunker Bean, he comes through triumphantly.Of those in the cast George Webb is most satisfactory. He is the hero's enemy and opposite, but nevertheless is largely responsible for his ascendancy. Little is required of the other characters, which are played by Millicent Fisher, Tom Guise and Andrew Robson.\\"Haunted Spooks\\" a boisterous Harold Lloyd farce, is also at the Rivoli.A screen version of \\"My Lady's Garter,\\" which was one of the latest stories written by Jacques Futreile before his death in the Titanic disaster, is at the Capitol this week. It was made more than a year ago by Maurice Tourneur, and for some reason was withheld from exhibition until the present. Certainly its proprietor could not have feared that it would fail, for it is an unusually interesting picture, combining the work of Mr. Tourneur with a good story. This is a combination not always effected. Mr. Tourneur is a skillful cinematician, and his productions are invariably excellent if considered by separate scenes from the pictorial point of view","excerpt":"but a number of them have been lacking in continuity; their stories and characters have not been made plausible and have failed to hold the interest. In the present case, however, Mr. Tourneur has a story that was well worked out originally and has been well adapted to the screen.Also the picture has the benefit of good acting. Wyndham Standing has he leading rôle, that of a man suspected of being \\"The Hawk,\\" who stole the famous garter from the British Museum, but who is really after the thief and finally exposes him. Holmes E. Herbert is the Hawk and Warner Richmond and Paul Clerget are Secret Service men who spend most of their time pursuing him and the hero. Sylvia Breamer is the very attractive heroine, and others in the cast are Warren Cook, Louise Derigney and Charles Craig. All in the cast are good. Mr. Standing's work is well known, and also Miss Breamer's. A word, then, about two others, Richmond and Clerget. The former has been seen in a number of Mr. Tourneur's pictures, and in each he has made his part count for something of value to the story. The latter is the man who was the inimitable Pierrot, Sr., in \\"Pierrot the Prodigal,\\" staged in 1916 by Winthrop Ames. He is a rare pantomimist and it is to be regretted that he has not been given full opportunity to try his talent on the screen. In \\"My Lady's Garter\\" he has a minor rôle, of which he makes the most, but which does not permit him to do anything extraordinary. Presumably he has by now returned to his home in Belgium, so, unless he acts before the camera over there, the opportunity for determining what his genius for pantomime is worth to motion pictures has been lost.\\"The Madonna of the Slums,\\" one of the Stage Women's War Relief films, with Galli-Curci, Holbrook Blinn, Jeanne Eagles and other well-known folk in the cast, is also at the Capitol.Mary Roberts Rinehart's \\"Dangerous Days\\" is at the Strand; \\"The Deadlier case,\\" with Blanche Sweet, is at the Broadway, and \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" which was at the Rivoli recently, has come to the Rialto.

For reasons that have more to do with his own clouded childhood than with matters of inheritance, Reisden impersonates the missing heir while secretly searching for his murderer. \\"Someone killed Richard,\\" he reasons. \\"Now Richard wants to know why.\\"   But the complexity of Reisden's position becomes unbearable to him when he falls in love with the present heir's 17-year-old fiancee, a Jamesian innocent whose awakening to the worldly \\"Richard\\" sends the story into a delicious romantic swoon.

In Their Words: A Collection of Quotes About Boston"},{"year":"1928","title":"A jolly, wholesome and refreshingly human picture, called \\"The Air Circus,\\" is the current William Fox production at the Gaiety Theatre. It is an exceptionally fine specimen of film work, a bright entertainment that exudes the spirit of youth and eagerness for adventure among the clouds. It carries one along with it, and there are moments, through the wonderfully contrived air scenes, when one feels as though one were above Mother Earth looking down from blue patches in the sky. Imagine a film concerned with airplane activites that contains so much fun that at the opening performance, last Saturday afternoon, it kept the audience in gales of laughter for most of the time. And this comedy is natural and all the more appealing to those who have made flights. True, the film has its sober moments, but they are none the less interesting.This production was directed by Howard Hawks and Lew Seller, who have cooperated so well that the minute the picture starts with the two would-be fliers it captivates the attention. One of these youths, Speed Doolittle, is the Don Juan of Ypsilanti, and when he decides to go forth to be an aviator many an eye is wet and many are the kisses Doolittle receives. His pal is Buddy Blake, a boy with dimpled cheeks and an engaging smile.Up to the time they are introduced, Blake and Doolittle have had to satisfy their ambitions with a homemade glider attached to a ramshackle automobile. They are thrilled by the sight of every real airplane and they long to pilot their own way through the air.Mrs. Blake (Louise Dresser) is loath to permit Buddy to be a flier, for she has lost one son in the war. Nevertheless, she consents, and with beating hearts the two youths leave Ypsilanti for the Pacific Coast to become students of flying. Then there is Sue Manning, the fetching young aviatrix, who listens to Speed Doolittle's romancing, at first without revealing to him her skill in the air.Those who have made flights in small machines will best appreciate the enthusiasm of these two youths and their subsequent feelings when in the air. Buddy is perceived gritting his teeth as he looks down while the machine takes him gradually aloft. His expression is that of a boy who looks once and then decides not to look again","excerpt":"but a second later he summons up courage to bend over the side again and is wonderstruck to see the earth so far beneath him.Subsequently, when Speed Doolittle and Buddy Blake have had a few trips in the air Speed, when soaring above the clouds, asks the pilot through the speaking tube what would happen if he pulled a certain lever.\\"Try it and see.\\" says the pilot.The boy pulls the lever and soon the machine is looping the loop, which alarms the young man and makes him wish that he hadn't been so inquisitive.Buddy Blake then has a crash, due to trying to avoid a collision with the machine Doolittle is piloting. Blake is only slightly injured, but he loses his nerve. He has another try, after being prevailed upon to go up by the instructor. Here one sees the airplane leaping about like a huge grasshopper, darting over trees and telegraph wires, and subsequently when it lands there is a mild bust-up.Mrs. Blake, due to a premonition that her son has met with an accident, comes to see her boy. It is here that one of the dialogue sequences is introduced with Louise Dresser singing in a motherly fashion to Buddy, who is depressed because he believes himself to be a coward. The dialogue is quite good most of the time, but it is a little too long. The sounds of Buddy sobbing are too loud and might be excluded. But there is a wonderful charm to those scenes in which Mrs. Blake comforts her son. She doesn't want him to fly any more and she asks him to promise her that he won't. Buddy does so.It is only a few moments later that Sue Manning and Speed take off, and in doing so they lose the undercarriage of their machine. They soar aloft, blissfullly ignorant of what has happened. Buddy pleads with his mother to let him chase after Speed to warn him, and eventually Mrs. Blake consents. Buddy then springs into an airplane and is soon rushing through the air after Speed. Eventually he is near enough to warn his pal, and, realizing the danger first, Sue leaps from the wing of the machine and parachutes to the earth. A second or so later the intrepid Speed turns a somersault from the machine's wing and is perceived also parachuting down.David Rollins's acting of the part of Buddy is wonderfully natural. Arthur Lake is excellent as the heart hunter. Speed, who left a dizzy blond or two back in Ypsilanti. Miss Dresser is charming in her part, and Sue Carol is attractive as the girl.Among the Movietone subjects exhibited prior to \\"The Air Circus\\" are Raquel Meller in her \\"Corpus Christi\\" sketch and Lionel Atwill in a playlet called \\"The White-Faced Fool,\\" both of which are splendid contributions.

Then, with all her sails, light and heavy, and studding sails on each side, alow and aloft, she is the most glorious moving object in the world. Even those who have been to sea a good deal are unlikely to have beheld such a sight, for from the deck of your own vessel you cannot see her, as you would a separate object.   One night, while we were in the tropics aboard the clipper Sea Cloud, I went out to the end of the flying-jib boom upon some duty, and, having finished it, turned round and lay over the boom. Being so far out from the deck, I could look at the ship as at a separate vessel; and there rose up from the water, supported only by the small dark hull, a pyramid of canvas towering up almost, as it seemed in the indistinct night air, to the clouds.

Out of the continuous battle over subtitles and the head-thumping encounters between those who damn and those who defend the movies there emerges the fact, which has been often dwelt upon in this column, that a photoplay is dramatically effective, that it stirs and holds and satisfies the interest to the extent that it is made of expressive motion pictures, which means to the extent that its story is told in the language of kinetic photography. Of course there must be a story, and it must be essentially entertaining","excerpt":"but a story isn't a story until it is told, and, no matter what the potential strength of any story may be, its actual vitality as a formed production depends upon the way in which it is told, whether in the medium of words, written or spoken, or of silent motion pictures. And if the story is told on the screen it is vital if it is substantially, composed of motion pictures that please the eye and convey ideas and information to their spectators. If the pictures offend the eye, or if they are meaningless in themselves, being simply incomplete photographs of people in unintelligible or unsignificant actions, the story lacks vitality, even though its potentiality may have been limitless.Consider, for instance, \\"The Prodigal Judge,\\" which is now going into its second week at B. S. Moss's new Cameo Theatre, in West Forty-second Street. This photoplay is based on a story by Vaughan Kester and is principally concerned with a politically prominent and aspiring citizen of the Old South who flings ambition away and becomes a bibulous vagabond after his wife has run off with another man. There is also, of course, the usual \\"love interest\\" and considerable sentimental and melodramatic emphasis, but the story's main reason for being is the character of the old \\"Judge.\\" And it's a good reason, provided the character is adequately developed. Everything depends upon the presence and performance of the actor cast as Judge Slocum Price and his pictorial environment.Can you imagine the flatness the story would have if some dull, inexpressive, self-conscious hulk of humanity such as is often called a \\"character actor\\" had this leading rôle? Undoubtedly you can, and if you want this conception to illustrate the point made here, you must, for the welcome fact is that the part is not played by one of the unwieldy and unyielding laborers of the screen you probably have in mind, but by Maclyn Arbuckle, in whom you see and know no other than Judge Slocum Price himself. Here is pantomime for you. Here is impersonation. Here is acting that brings a fictional character to life, Mr. Arbuckle's facial expressions, the way he walks, his gestures, his bearing, his manner in every incident in which he figures are all illuminating. They vivify realistically the old vagabond, they make him a human and comprehensible individual, so that you become interested in him as a person and follow him sympathetically in his wanderings and adventures.But, though Mr. Arbuckle's pantomime does much to vitalize \\"The Prodigal Judge\\" and, as it comes to the spectator, is distinctly pictorial, it would not be enough, for even the acting of several characters would not be enough to make the photoplay as a whole a living story of the people and places with which it deals. This may be achieved only through the agency of a director who can make motion pictures with life in them, and such a director is Edward Jose. He has provided \\"The Prodigal Judge\\" with what may be called atmospheric settings which give a clear impression of river and plantation life in the Old South, and he has also created many sinking scenes, some of them effective from the purely pictorial point of view, as, for example, a number of extremely well-done night scenes, and others because of the vividness with which intense action is pictured in them. Mr. Jose seems to have seized practically every cinematographic opportunity offered by the story, and the result is a genuinely interesting photoplay.In addition to Mr. Arbuckle, the cast is competent, too. Ernest Torrence as Solomon Mahaffey, the \\"Judge's\\" companion of the road, makes his character stand out clearly and in effective contrast to that of the \\"Judge.\\" Jean Paige, as the heroine of the minor love story in the photoplay, meets the modest requirements of her part, and little Charles Eaton is an appealing child, who, it is to be hoped, will not be spoiled, as most of the other screen children have been.So, although \\"The Prodigal Judge\\" is an adaptation of a written story which has not been entirely freed from the printed page, and although its melodrama is overstrained in a number of places, it is in the main, an unusually entertaining photoplay, chiefly because of the effectiveness of its motion pictures—and also, it may be added, because of the sincerity with which its characters have been delineated.AND, speaking of photoplays which are characteristically cinematographic, one must turn again and in a hurry to that unforgettable \\"One Glorious Day,\\" which was at the Rivoli last week. Was there ever a more glorious motion picture, in the sense that the true glory of the screen lies in its declaration of independence and its demonstration of its ability to make good use of any independence it may win? This spiritistic satire is something that could not be attempted on the stage, and it would not be the same thing at all in any printed form. It belongs exclusively to the screen, and on the screen it is a joyful thing.It is idle, perhaps, to speculate on the question of who deserves most credit for this extraordinary film. One may well let all concerned share the honor of its production, for there is enough to go around. Still, the picture is so well done as a piece of cinematography, it reveals such a true appreciation of the real spiritistic hypothesis, it is so specially marked by imagination and sincerity, and its humor is so sharply pointed that one cannot help wondering whether it is the happy result of unusual collaboration or of the predominance of some individual.To an extent, undoubtedly, the picture reflects the penetrating and irreverent humor of Will Rogers, and certainly Mr. Rogers's performance greatly adds to the zest of the story, so it may be said that he had a good deal to do with the production. Also, \\"Walter Woods, who wrote the original story in collaboration with A. B. Baringer, and then prepared the scenario alone, has shown a skillful hand in other adaptations, so he is not to be ignored. And the camera man, who was not named on the Rivoli program, deserves unstinted praise too, for, no matter what effects others may have desired, he is the man who was able to get them.But when everything is taken into consideration, one is strongly inclined to give the first prize to James Cruze, who directed the production, because of the fact that a director can spoil anything that any one else may do and must be an expert with an imagination to avoid spoiling it, and also because in previous productions Mr. Cruze has given evidence of just such humor and cinematographic skill as make \\"One Glorious Day\\" truly glorious. Do you remember, for instance, the pure fun and finished cinematography of \\"The Roaring Road,\\" \\"You're Fired,\\" \\"The Lottery Man,\\" and \\"Hawthorne of the U. S. A.,\\" the best pictures in which Wallace Reid has ever appeared? And, with obviously difficult material, Mr. Cruze was also able to give something of real spontaneity to his later pictures in which Bryant Washburn and Roscoe Arbuckle had the principal parts. Therefore, it does not seem unfair to the others, nor unwarranted, to feel most grateful to Mr. Cruze for that special treat, \\"One Glorious Day.\\" SCREEN; SAY IT WITH PICTURES"},{"year":"1921","title":"PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 18.--When the Grand Circuit races ware resumed at Narberth, Pa., today, the track was dry and fast","excerpt":"but a strong breeze blowing down the back stretch made the time average slower than on the opening day.

Landlord-Tenant Row Puts Both in One Cell","excerpt":"But After a While Dispute Turns Into Amity"},{"year":"1929","title":"FILM makers might loosely be classified in two categories—those who pursue art, with a very capital A, without semblance of regard for considerations demanded by the necessity of a popular appeal which shall be re-echoed in box-office receipts, and those who seek money, with an equally capital M, in apparent defiance of all or most of the accepted canons of artistic endeavor. Money, in the present conditions of the cinema, certainly talks louder than art","excerpt":"but after all the history of progress shows that there has been no considerable achievement except upon foundations of a solid and endurable character. So the world can live in hope of a serious alliance between the studio and the box office—an alliance which shall be a mariage de convenance productive of mutual benefit to all concerned, and most particularly to the public whose taste must be cultivated or debased, according to the methods which most prevail at the moment.At the moment, if one cares to continue these generalizations, British film makers would appear to be stumbling rather blindly after artistic ideals, with half an eye turned upon the box office, while American film makers would seem to be devoting themselves so largely to the acquisition of the shekels which the masses of the public are prepared to spend on their amusements that they do no more than make a perfunctory bow to the canons of artistic taste which are proclaimed in their advertisements.Britain vs. America.Two new films—both of the talkie variety—which have been trade-shown here this week, furnish particular illustrations of the foregoing general premises. One is a British production, the other is American. \\"High Treason\\" is the title given to the former. Perhaps the reader will divine the name of the latter from the description of it which will be given later. \\"High Treason\\" is the work of Maurice Elvey. Just as Mr. Hitchcock's \\"Blackmail\\" was hailed recently as establishing the supremacy of the British audible films over American productions, so now Mr. Elvey's \\"High Treason\\" is proclaimed to have \\"advanced the treatment of spectacle far beyond everything we have yet seen.\\" It is a possibly pardonable conceit for an English critic to write: \\" 'Blackmail' and 'High Treason' give to Britain complete supremacy in the world of talking pictures.\\" Such adulation must be balm of Gilead to the very sorely harassed souls of British producers and British holders of stock in all British cinematograph enterprises. It would be \\"gold, frankincense and myrrh\\"—and especially gold—if it were found that the public took much stock in these \\"trade-show\\" paeans of praise. American talking pictures have got the ear of the British public so much filled with their nine months' lead over the rest of the world that an auricular operation will be required to open that same ear to the claim of the British sound-film to be heard. If a surgical operation be necessary to get a joke into the head of a Scotsman, all the aurists in Harley Street will be required to work day and night upon the ears of the Englishman to make them thoroughly receptive of such extravagancies as some patriotically-minded London critics have recently indulged in.\\"High Treason.\\"That there are merits in both \\"Blackmail\\" and \\"High Treason\\" nobody will deny. The former has already been discussed in this correspondence. \\"High Treason\\" suffers from many of the same defects as those which limited the appeal of \\"Blackmail.\\" To begin with, it doesn't wash water. It is founded upon a play written by Pemberton Billings, and produced by the author at his own expense a year or so ago. Mr. Billings's drama had a run that was short but not sweet, unlike the proverbial donkey's gallop. It was laughed out of court. Why a film maker should imagine that a play which was a failure should make a successful talking picture passes ordinary comprehension. That Mr. Elvey saw in it possibilities of novel presentation is quite understandable, and in fact in that particular respect his work is most highly commendable. With vivid imagination and great technical accomplishment he has produced pictures of what the \\"world may be like in 1940 which certainly arrest attention. They are interesting even if one doesn't consider them convincing. But will London be a robot town in such a little time as ten or eleven years hence? There may be a new bridge at Charing Cross, though even that is not certain; and there may even be a Channel tunnel, which is even less certain. Helicopters may be in common use and airplanes may land on and take off from the roofs of many-storied buildings overshadowing the dome of St. Paul's. There may be no newspapers, broadcasting having supplanted both The London Times and the journals which are published by Lord Rothermere and Lord Beaver-brook each morning and afternoon in this year of grace.But Maurice Elvey does not convince anybody that the pictures he presents so admirably are likely to be a correct forecast of conditions that will prevail in such a short space of time as ten years from now.Fantastic and Far-Fetched.Then the two stories which go to make up the plot of \\"High Treason\\" are, in their respective fashions, both so fantastic and far-fetched that there is no possibility of illusion being created in the mind of the audience to whose eyes and ears appeal is made. There is going to be a war between a united Europe and a united America. International financiers are at the bottom of the trouble. However, there is also a Peace League, with millions of adherents, and with a president who holds that to kill is a crime, but shoots the \\"President of Europe\\" just before he can broadcast a declaration of war upon America. This story is really such a farrago of nonsense that one is sorry Maurice Elvey could not find better material to his expert hand. The subsidiary love plot does possess some elements of human interest, and as portrayed and spoken by Miss Benita Hume and Jameson Thomas makes one realize the truth of Shakespeare's dictum that all the world loves a lover.Worthy Acoustic Qualities.Both the photographic and acoustic qualities of \\"High Treason\\" are on a high scale. American makers of sound films have certainly, as has been said before in this correspondence, something to learn from their British competitors. The Gaumont-British Company is the producing organization.Reference above made to an American talking film trade-shown this week need only be recalled as illustrative of the extreme tendency of transatlantic producers to play upon strings which give out a golden chink. As this film has already been shown in America and criticized there with kindly courtesy, it need only be said here that when certain canons of art are entirely disregarded pathos deteriorates into bathos. There is a happy medium in all things. When that happy medium between the quest of gold and the pursuit of art is found it will be a good day for the future of the world in general and no less for the film industry in particular.Marilyn Miller was once a member of the quintet, \\"The Five Columbias,\\" a troupe of acrobats that toured the country twenty years ago, and it was only recently that Miss Miller was able to reunite the little group on the stage of her set for the audible picture of \\"Sally,\\" in which she is appearing for First National.

So the question is why these particular years?   Some of the answer is in the sheer contrast between Stephan before and after the 1970's, the decade in which his career took off, but its most important part lies buried in Christopher Knight's catalogue essay. Not only were the earlier works produced by the artist while still a student at the San Francisco Art Institute, but they were, says Knight, the first he did after switching from industrial design to art.

It is a story that might appeal to an audience of those who need narcotics, but to the average person who has a night off and goes to the theatre for entertainment it is not pleasing.A valiant attempt has been made to render this production effective, and James Kirkwood's performance in certain sequences is unusually good. The story, however, wanders along until it becomes tiresome, and the dramatic climax is spoiled. C. Gardiner Sullivan, who is responsible for the scenario, has at times left certain characters out of the story for so long that they are almost forgotten. One realizes throughout the story that there must be a great deal of truth in some of the details of the drug addict, inasmuch as Mrs. Reid has undoubtedly put in her personal experiences with other persons addicted to drugs.The drug peddler is symbolized through double exposure by a hyena, who prowls throughout the scenes in ghostly form. Efforts are made to show how the drug is delivered to the various purchasers, either through hollow chocolate creams, the sole of a shoe, the legging of a boot and the inside of a book","excerpt":"but all seem to make so much fuss about getting the little piece of paper, that through their suspicions conduct they might be more easily detected by the narcotic squad than if they brazenly took the drug by a shake of the hand. It seems rather overdrawn when the head of the drug ring sends an emissary miles to see that \\"Alan McFarland has what he needs.\\"The story concerns a tired lawyer who receives relief from a drug-taking physician, and eventually becomes an addict. After struggling and battling, he is finally cured through the belief that his wife has also taken to the morphine habit. He officiates as the attorney for the narcotic squad and the head of the drug ring, once before acquitted, is finally convicted.To last night's audience it brought neither tears nor sighs. The production is much too long, and certain sequences could easily be eliminated to the benefit of the film and thus give better continuity to the story.Bessie Love is capable as one of the drug addicts, and Mrs. Reid's performance is appealing. Some of the city, State and Federal officials in the vicinity of Los Angeles have appeared in minor parts in the film. George??? E. Cryer??? Mayor of Los Angeles, has the part of a city official???: Judge Benjamin Bledsoe of the Twelfth Federal District, is a jurist; Dr. R. B. Von Kleinsmid, President of the University of Southern California, is an educator, and Martha Nelson McCan, Los Angeles Park Commissioner, is a police official.At the expiration of the show, Mrs. Reid was called upon to speak.

By the mid-1960's, he was voraciously exploring the guitar's literature and doing everything Mr. Segovia had mandated: he commissioned new works, rediscovered and transcribed old ones, toured the world and made dozens of exemplary recordings.   But at the same time, he grew fascinated with the guitar's popular side, and he began conducting sideline experiments in jazz and rock, eventually going so far as to take up the electric guitar and form a rock band, called Sky.

Robert who? Nobody would have asked that question 30 years ago, when Mr. Stephens seemed the most talented of the young men gracing the newly formed National Theater and was even regarded as Laurence Olivier's natural heir at the head of the acting trade. But he gradually faded, the victim of serious personal problems. But in 1991, almost out of the blue, the Royal Shakespeare Company cast him as Falstaff in \\"Henry IV,\\" and he rose to the challenge, creating a fat knight who roistered and gourmandised with the best of them but was most himself when ruefully contemplating his own self-indulgent, half-wasted life.

It is a picture which might better have been called \\"Charley's Niece,\\" for the principal character, impersonated by a midget named Little Billy, creates most of the fun by his conduct while dressed as a little girl. Little Billy is a well-proportioned diminutive person, who wears well-cut clothes, smokes cigars and greases his hair. His face may be small, but there seems a great deal of thought back of it and when he puts on a wig with golden curls he rather reminds one of a shrunken English Justice.Little Billy plays the part of Billy Fitzgerald, manager and mascot for Jim Stone, a pugilist of renown. When conversing with those who tower over him, Billy holds out his arms as a sign that he wants to be lifted up to a position of equality with his friends. He consents to pose as Arthur Graham's child to impress a wealthy old aunt, and Dorothy Brennan agrees to pretend that she is Mrs. Graham.Billy's face is rather old for a little girl, but he wears so many curls that Aunt Phoebe is charmed with the child. Like the midget in \\"The Unholy Three.\\" Little Billy assumes a thoroughly masculine posture when the aunt is absent, but as soon as the old lady reappears the chip of humanity becomes a gentle, affectionate little girl, who by no means objects to kissing pretty big girls.Much excitement is caused when Billy suddenly disappears and the scenes sway to those of a prize ring, where Jim for the first time enters the ring without his little pal being in his corner. The fight continues, with Jim getting a sad pummeling. Then, at the propitious moment, a little girl with golden corkscrew curls tries to get into Madison Square Garden. The unsympathetic attendants refuse to admit her, and finally \\"she\\" accosts a big man in a huge fur coat. Will he help her? \\"She\\" has to tell the big man that \\"she\\" is Billy Fitzgerald in disguise, and thereupon the big man wraps the mite in his fur coat and not so very long afterward Jim, down for about the count of eight, hears a familiar voice adjuring him to get up and fight.Madge Kennedy plays the part of an attractive heroine, the girl who pretended that she was Billy's mother. As one might gather, a romance ensues and she does not frown upon Arthur Graham's proposal of marriage.Creighton Hale fills the part of Graham. Flora Finch, the veteran actress who knows her screen, makes the most of Aunt Phoebe's character. David Butler is physically qualified for the rôle of Jim Stone.

The method of the film is so self-effacing as to be no method at all, a series of close-ups and medium close-ups of this extraordinary, shrewd, amazingly vigorous old woman as she answers questions put to her by the film maker.\\"The Confessions of Winifred Wagner\\" is ironically titled in that Winifred Wagner tells everything but confesses nothing. With the kind of candor that is so aggressive that it puts her listeners on the defensive, she talks about her early meetings with Hitler, and of their shared love of the music of Richard Wagner that became the basis of a friendship that lasted from 1922 until Hitler's death in 1945.She also talks about family squabbles, about her early decision to put her husband and his work with the Bayreuth Festival ahead of her children—\\"There were always people to take care of them\\"—about great musicians she's known, about the rise of National Socialism and the devastating war","excerpt":"but always what fascinates us is the manner in which she resolutely refuses to turn her back on Hitler.Winifred Wagner professes to believe that she was always \\"unpolitical,\\" that the Hitler she knew was a kind and gentle man, and, when she is pressed, that he really wasn't responsible for the Final Solution. Both she and Hitler, she says rather airily, were sad about the bombing of London, but by that time she considered herself to be completely German. There were no feelings of divided loyalties.\\"The Confessions of Winifred Wagner\\" is much more than the self-serving memoir it might initially appear to be, largely because Winifred Wagner is too honest in her own way to be concerned with the minor disturbances of reputation. What we see on the screen is one manifestation of a singular family, as well as of an entire European cultural tradition, captured simply, cleanly, by a film maker who understands that by deferring to its subject, the camera is most often victorious.\\"The Confessions of Winifred Wagner,\\" will be shown at the Film Forum tonight through Sunday at 7:45 P.M., and repeated there next week, Thursday through Sunday, at the same time.

As a frank piece of screen expressionism, it does have its interesting points","excerpt":"but as a job of pictorial documentation, which it also aims to be, it falls far off.At the start, there are hopeful indications that this-picture is going to be a scathingly literal visualization of the misery of Europe's \\"lost\\" kids—in this case, represented by a handful in Hungary. For the camera of Geza Radvanyi, who wrote, directed and produced, is avid in snatching onto details that are concrete and harrowing as it rounds up the group of tattered youngsters who are at the center of the tale.There is the wretchedly frightened little fellow who cowers in terror and horror amid the gaudy paraphernalia of a fair grounds as the bombs rain upon his town. There are the two swaggering adolescents who drag out of the ruins of a jail. There is the lad who clings to his cherished violin and many, many more. And there are also the brutal brawling battles between the bands of wandering children as they meet on the dusty roads and open highways in their aimless search for food.These literal aspects of the nature of the children and their struggles to survive are pictured by Mr. Radvanyi with terrible clarity. The children look like tragic vagrants and their behavior as such is credible. For a short stretch, it seems as though the author has embarked upon an over-whelming film.But slowly a definite stylization begins to pervade the work and the children discard their literal aspects to become symbolic shapes. Mr. Radvanyi's camera takes more and more to watching feet, hands, faces, moving shadows and actions from angular points of view. And his story tends toward an abstract fable as his children invade a castle ruin, where dwells a mellow old musician who inspires them to the noble and the good. By the time the story closes, the kids are no longer flesh and blood; they are merely pictorial abstractions, singing \\"La Marseillaise.\\"This is too bad, because the impact of realism that is mustered at the start is allowed to dissolve and become sterile in the sentimentalities of a happy end. And it is also too bad because some of the sheer cinematic tricks that Mr. Radvanyi has used to this accomplishment are arresting in themselves. Even in the latter part of his picture, some of his most maudlin shots, such as close-ups of a wounded boy dying, have an intriguing quality. And his actors occasionally deliver startling images amid banal posing.It is not surprising that this picture has gathered a batch of awards at several film festivals in Europe.

And it was not until after all the actors assembled for the first reading that a crucial decision gave Kate the most moving scene in the entire play.   ''Neil came over to me at the end of that reading and said, 'I'm going to write another scene for you,' '' Ms. Lavin recalls. ''He said, 'I want to see the character when she was happy.' Two days later the scene was delivered to me.''   In that scene - which blazes across the stage like a shooting star, leaving a luminous trail of deeply felt emotion in its wake - Eugene's aging, abandoned mother recalls her life's most transcendent moment of glory: the night she danced with George Raft at the Primrose Ballroom.

Nearly 18 percent of Spanish workers are employed in farming; in Portugal, 27 percent are, far exceeding the Common Market average of 8 percent.

By David Plante.  173 pp. New York: Atheneum. $9.95.   AN American young man, a novelist, settles in London in the early 70's and pursues the friendship of much older women, who are either themselves literary or have entree to the literary life. It is a given that these women will be complicated, stubborn, strong-willed, and that the relationship between each of them and the novelist will be tricky, even suspect. If this were the 1870's, the circumstances would provide a Jamesian subtext fulfilling, only very slowly, some psychologically unforeseen purpose","excerpt":"but as it is the 1970's, the entire matter is at once laid self-consciously before us, and we are free to decide how much or how little it all means.   David Plante has known, with varying degrees of closeness, Jean Rhys, Sonia Orwell and Germaine Greer. ''Difficult Women'' is a series of memoirs of the three, linked together by Mr. Plante's idea that his own complicated motives in devoting himself to these friendships is part of the story he has to tell. The idea, however, is a suggestion, not an intrusion. Mr. Plante is too good a writer to lose his balance or his subject: the spectacular exaggerations of will and character the three women embody. COMPLICATED FRIENDSHIPS"},{"year":"1923","title":"With a less impossible story, \\"The Rustle of Silk,\\" the film which is holding forth this week at the Rivoli, might have been a production worth remembering","excerpt":"but as it is??? all the careful direction and attention to detail put into the picture by Herbert Brenon are lost on a yarn that flops like a house of cards. Seldom has a picture been mode that breathed such a true London atmosphere as \\"The Rustle of Silk,\\" with allowances for minor motion picture liberties. Another point in favor of the production is the exceptionally good titling.Conway Tearle plays the part of Arthur Fallaray, an English statesman. Although his acting is quite food, he does not appeal in this particular character, especially as he has to play against Cyril Chadwick, an actor who never seems to lose an chance on the screen. Chadwick almost stole the honors from the hero in \\"The Christian.\\" And in this film he is again a most sympathetic villain.Betty Compson is Lola de Breze, the daughter of an old English aristocrat who is forced to mead watches for a living. Lola has dreams of the old days, and on seeing a published picture of Fallaray, she loses her heart to him. As a hairdresser she goes to Fallaray home to do Lady Feo's hair—Lady Feo being the wife of Fallaray. Lola is so expert at hairdressing that Lady Feo engages her as her maid.One day Lola receives a gown from her mistress, and with a borrowed wrap she goes to the Ritz, just to catch a glimpse of Fallaray. She encounters Paul Chalfont (Chadwick), who owns The Daily Herald, and after a fuss, accepts his invitation to dine. She sees Fallaray and Chalfont introduces her as Countess de Breze. Lola writes letters to Fallaray for her own amusement. They are never mailed. But Lady Feo finds them and asks Chalfont to take them to her lawyer for exhibits in possible divorce proceedings. Chalfont publishes the letters on the morning Fallaray had met with a shooting accident. Lola hurries down to see him, having been discharged after the discovery of the letters.It is Lola, recognized as the \\"Countess,\\" who persuades her idol to fight. He becomes Prime Minister, and Lola goes back to her home. Lady Feo does not seem so keen on bringing a divorce action.Anna Q. Nilsson is very sure of herself as Lady Feo, and Miss Compson is capable as Lola. The appearance of half a dozen members of the cabin at Fallaray's shooting lodge, after reading the published letters, is somewhat amusing.The second feature at the Rivoli is \\"Adventures in the Far North,\\" a series of pictures taken during a hunting and whaling expedition that lasted seven months. They are singularly interesting. There are some fine scenes showing the harpooning of \\"whales, also pictures of walruses. But perhaps the best picture is that showing a polar bear and her cub. An attempt is made from the ship to catch the cub. When the rope is around it the mother fights and lashes the side of the vessel. Eventually because of the remarkable performance of the mother bear the little one is freed and one sees them both swimming off, the cub keeping very close to the big bear. Captain F. E. Kleinschmidt, who took his wife on this expedition, has had the picture titled as if it were Mrs. Kleinschmidt's diary, which is quite effective. It is a most interesting production and runs for about an hour.

By Sheila MacLeod.  181 pp. New York: Schocken Books. $12.95.   IF it is true, as some psychiatric theorists maintain, that symptoms can be read as metaphorical communiques about an individual's inner world, then the message beamed out by the person suffering from anorexia nervosa would appear to be easily translatable: ''I am starving (emotionally) to death.'' The anorexic - typically an adolescent female who is bright, attractive and from a relatively affluent background - may be literally starving herself to death, for this illness involves a dogged, bizarrely unending pursuit of thinness.   The word ''anorexia'' means ''without appetite,'' and the word ''nervosa'' means ''of nervous origin''","excerpt":"but as Sheila MacLeod makes clear in this autobiographical work, the anorexic individual is anything but not-hungry. She is ravenous, obsessed by food; she thinks about food and about its preparation incessantly.

Certain officials and certain young and stormy members of the party were all for having it suppressed. \\"Why?\\" asks a curious stranger. \\"On the ground of indecency, perhaps?\\" Not at all! Simply that the picture had too strong a tinge of \\"individualism.\\" It would do for audiences abroad—in fact, several prints of it had already been sent away, the box office returns to be exchanged for those precious rolls of blank celluloid which the Soviets as yet do not manufacture. In the U. S. S. R., however, it was not fit to be shown.The director-in-chief of Sovkino, the largest motion picture trust in the Union, believed in the film, and so did his production-manager. They arranged for test performances to be held before workers' councils and in factory clubs. And the workers, perceiving its excellence, voted to let it through. This picture, said the workers, is like life itself and must be accepted., And so, while protests still come from the sterner ideologists, according to the latest reports, \\"Alone\\" will be seen in Moscow motion picture houses two and a half months from now.Why should a mere motion picture be weighed so gravely in the scale of politics? Partly because this particular film was based on a real incident, widely publicized at the time in the Soviet press. It seems that a young girl, sent to teach school in a far-off Northern province, became involved in a revolt that was brewing between the poor shepherds and the rich sheep owners. On her way to the nearest town to protest against the injustice of the chiefs, or barini, she was abandoned in the snow and rescued by the shepherds. As a result of exposure, her hands were badly frozen and an operation became necessary to save her life. In recognition of her conduct, the Soviet Government sent an airplane to bring her to Moscow and salvation.Mass Psychology.The Soviet leaders never forget how useful the cinema can be in persuading the public to think in terms of mass action. Ideology in this field is therefore strictly supervised. Naturally, it takes a literal-minded turn now and then, because there are always some people who have clear ideas about politics but not much feeling for art. The hopeful thing is that a first-rate production usually finds champions, too. So a picture like \\"Alone\\"—in spite of the fact that it stresses the reactions of one person rather than the mass, and portrays the customs of a backward race rather than the latest thing in health stations and baby farms—seems to have been accepted for its sheer artistic power.Of course, the continuity has been altered four or five times to conform to the censorship requirements. These operations, however, have left no visible scars. It seems probable, if ironic, that they have even improved the film.Last week it was displayed in a private view at the First Moscow Theatre of the Cinema. The showing was at midnight before a handful of people, mostly members of the Piscator German Theatre group, which is now working on a Soviet film. Every one was tired and a trifle limp","excerpt":"but as the scenes of \\"Alone\\" unrolled upon the screen, as the musical score developed, now swelling to an orchestra of a hundred pieces, now dwindling to a single instrument, the sense of fatigue wore away.The photography itself has emotional values, through a device of which the spectator is scarcely aware—I mean, the predominance by turns of black, white, and gray to meet the changing moods of the story. In the beginning, everything is white and gay: the bedclothes, as the girl Kuzmina awakens in the morning; the buildings in the street; her dress as she goes to meet her young man on the corner, and stares with him into a china shop full of white tea-pots and casseroles. For a moment the young people cling together on the rear platform of a street car, and the whole screen flickers into prismatic color—red, blue, green, yellow; only to darken suddenly when the girl learns of her appointment to teach in the far-off mountains of Siberia.She rebels, she will not leave; and the music rebels with her. Presently social conscience, in the shape of a loud-speaker on the street, reminds her that a human being must not live for herself alone, but rather for the good of society. Teachers are needed in Central Asia. During the struggle that follows in her mind, tones of dull gray alternate with the flashing white of the letters on a telephone booth; and the music, also, reflects her confusion. Throughout the mournful early days of her stay in the Alai, grays and blacks dominate the screen—except for one grotesque symbol, a white flapping horse-skin stretched on a pole, the head shriveled and intact, the lips drawn back into a toothy grin. At the moment of arrival, the girl with her knapsack is standing beneath this totem. Her eyes travel upward and she sees it for the first time, fearfully. A single flute repeats the melody of an old Russian folk-song, sad and clear and marvelously evocative of solitude.The Climax.Then comes the climax of the film, played on a background of dazzling white. The girl stands deserted in the centre of an immense snow-plain. Helplessly she begins to run. Face to face with the loneliest death, she realizes suddenly that she is not alone, but one with the group of poor nomads whose battle she has made her own. It comes to her as a revelation and a comfort, and half-hysterically she begins to sing a marching song of the Red Army. The music swells to heroic proportions; and the composition of the scene repeats, with a dramatic reversal of color values, those moments in the early part of the film where she stood alone in a snow-white dress on a darkening sand beach.If the methods of photography and the music by Shostokovitch have lifted this film to the level of a fine art, the acting of Kuzmina colors it with human warmth. That young woman of 24, whose name is the same in life as in the picture, is a very great actress indeed. Not beautiful and never well-dressed, she conveys the appeal of youth to a degree that only Ludmilla Pitoeff, of the Théâtre des Arts in Paris, has so far been able to do. Her manner of bending her head to one side, of clasping her hands together, is simple and terribly touching. Her face, almost prim in repose, is mobile to a rare degree, able to reflect all shades of bewilderment or delight. Probably her finest moments are in the snow scene toward the end. There, in the space of about eight minutes, Kuzmina has managed to suggest the sudden passage from youth to maturity as the result of an overwhelming experience. It is the culmination of her three years' work in motion pictures, two of which were spent in the making of \\"Alone.\\"The Acting.Naturally, the whole credit for her performance is not Kuzmina's. A great deal is due to the directors who have trained her. So strict was their supervision that they spent three days on one scene. It is possible that similar instances of devotion to good acting may also exist in America. The final measure of the directors' art lies elsewhere. Their really sensational achievement was to persuade a whole group of nomads, including some twenty small children, to act out a scenario with absolute naturalness and ease.The young men try modestly to deprecate this feat, by claiming they did not work with really wild nomads but only with what Mr. Mencken would call the \\"civilized minority.\\" The fact remains, however, that they spent months in patient repetition, weeks in searching for location, and heaven knows how many discouraged nights in the mountain fastness of the Alai. To Trauberg and Kuznetzov the success of the production belongs in the last analysis, and theirs was the keenest relief when they learned that \\"Alone\\" was scheduled, after all, to be produced in Russia.

This, of course, does not apply to the fantastic notion of having an undersized man impersonate a monkey, as this particular part is admirably played by Jacques Lerner, who figured as the talking simian in the original effort.Unconvincing as some of the episodes are, they are none the less interesting. Mr. Walsh knows how to tell a shadow story, but the idea of having to cope with a human being that is foisted on audiences as a monkey is possibly a task beyond the ken of any director. Still, there are some episodes that might have benefited by pondering over the amount of common sense the heroine of this story was to possess. She hears the supposed monkey tell her that he loves her, and while she is aghast at the animal impersonator's remark it never dawns on her that Jocko is not a monkey. The screen demands more decided realism than the stage, and therefore one not only reflects on the incidents that are projected but also upon those that are not depicted. Hence one wonders why Olivette, the heroine of this adventure, continued to be blind to the disguise of the small man.Here the tale is turned into one of circus life. It is due to the lack of funds that the four men decide to try and make a fortune by exhibiting one of their number as a talking monkey. Jocko and an impecunious Marquis are both in love with Olivette","excerpt":"but as they fought together in the war, they are firm friends.The menace of this narrative is Maisie. It was due to the Marquis's fondness for her that his father disowned him. She and her consort, a lion tamer, eventually reap a terrible end.Here the producer dilates upon a chapter in which Jocko is stolen by Bergerin, the lion-tamer, who leaves a real monkey in Jocko's place. Far too much time is devoted to the stretch showing the animal in Olivette's dressing room.Mr. Lerner bows his legs, lengthens his arms and stoops, thus making his impersonation as seen on the screen almost uncanny. When he is alone with his three friends he stretches himself and takes off his mask.Raymond Hitchcock is ever master of his rôle, that of a pocketpicking but none the less good-natured showman. Don Alvarado does fairly well as the Marquis, whose timidity can be accounted for by the fact that he is out of his element. Jane Winton is competent as the deceitful Maisie. Olive Borden makes the most of the part of Olivette. August Tollaire gives a worthy impersonation of a bearded old showman.

PARIS SURVEYS ITS SEASON'S PROSPECTS; PROSPECTS IN PARIS"},{"year":"1928","title":"An ingeniously contrived pictorial undersea melodrama, inspired by the disasters of the S-51 and the S-4, was presented last night by Columbia Pictures Corporation at the Embassy Theatre. This production is known as \\"Submarine,\\" and while it has technical lapses and the suspense is stretched out a little too long, the scenes are so compelling and the acting so competent that interest in it never slackens. As this picture is unfurled there are sequences that bring to mind \\"What Price Glory\\" and \\"Tell It to the Marines.\\" It is, however, a thoroughly up-to-date specimen, some of the \\"shots\\" being familiar ones of the United States warships and airplane carriers, which have been cleverly spliced into the film as incidents of the narrative.The story begins in a merry fashion, but in the latter chapters there are a number of glimpses of men aboard a submarine that has been sent to the bottom of the sea. These flashes are harrowing, but they are nevertheless pictured with no little imagination. They give a realistic conception of the horrors aboard a sunken submersible. One sees the careful use of the oxygen tanks, the men strewn about the steel deck, bathed in perspiration and gasping for breath. Some are pleading with the commander to let out more oxygen, and when he consents to do so you perceive the relief of the sufferers. Here is a young chap slowly dying, nodding his head, and, although fearful, he tries to keep a faint smile on his face. There is the courageous commander and a warrant officer, Bob Mason, who set an example to the crew Mason is entertaining the crew with card tricks as the commander keeps a watchful eye on the oxygen tank dial.Prior to these stretches the submarine is perceived plodding through the water. Suddenly the commander sees through the periscope an approaching destroyer and, realizing the danger, he tries to surface his vessel","excerpt":"but before he can do so there is a crash and torrents of water rush into the engine room and other compartments. There is the wild dash of men to other sections of the vessel and bulkheads are closed as quickly as possible. These scenes are enormously effective.Another praiseworthy point in connection with this melodrama is that the characters are particularly well drawn. There is the inconstant but beautiful girl to whom no eyes are so bright as those at the moment looking into hers. It may be her husband in one case, then his friend, and finally she discovers a new affair, but, as has been said before, she is true to the navy.Jack Dorgan is an expert diver, a warrant officer, who loves nothing so much when he comes up from under the sea as a chew of tobacco, the larger the better. He is a jolly fellow, but when he meets \\"Snuggles\\" (Dorothy Revier), he is so captivated by her appealing, longlashed eyes, her straight nose with the suggestion of a tilt, that he asks her to marry him, and she is so struck by the originality of such an idea that she consents. When Dorgan is away on a diving job, Bob Mason happens along and then you have a little triangle, with Dorgan madly jealous.\\"Snuggles\\" knows on which side her bread is buttered, and with a lie or so she continues in favor with Dorgan. Then comes news of the submarine accident, but Dorgan refuses to leave \\"Snuggles,\\" until he suddenly realizes that \\"Snuggles\\" has been playing the vampire to his fool.An excellent idea of making speed to the scene of the disaster is pictured, and when Dorgan succeeds in reaching the damaged submarine and passing into it an air line, it is filmed so well that last night it aroused hearty applause.Jack Holt gives a capital performance as Dorgan. Ralph Graves is splendid as Mason. Clarence Burton is wonderfully natural as the submarine commander. Miss Revier is radiantly beautiful and she also acts intelligently.Frank R. Capra's direction is especially clever, for not only has he attended to the action of the story, but he has also obtained from his players infinitely better characterization than one is apt to see on the screen, especially in a melodrama.Some of the sound effects—such as the whirring of airplane motors, the knocking on doors and the hissing of the oxygen—were not always happily timed, and it would therefore have been better at times to have heard nothing.

You feel that there is added tension in No. 10 Downing Street simply because of his presence in the country; the Bovril signs flicker and palely twitch with neon fright, and even Cabinet Ministers look at each other askance, knowing the master fiend's facility in the art of disguise. Owing to this atmosphere of mutual suspicion, the audience itself may very soon begin to feel it can't trust anybody, including especially Messrs. Lee Katz and Anthony Paul Kelly, the authors.After one of the scenes—in fact, a scene in which an insignificant-looking German corporal with a smudge of mustache and the name of Adolf is publicly bawled out by his superior officer—even the most gullible member of the audience may begin to suspect that he is the victim of a bit of leg-pulling. The rest of the plot is almost as clear from the beginning as are the villainous motives of Herr Karloff: it is obvious, for instance, that any spy as beautiful as Margaret Lindsay couldn't possibly be a German agent. Connoisseurs of the spy melodrama, therefore, may find it fascinating to speculate on how she won that decoration from the Wilhelmstrasse, the mystical importance of which causes even Boris to blanch and bow deferentially, forgetting his suspicions that she is an undercover British operative.
