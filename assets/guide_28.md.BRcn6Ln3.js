United States statutory law does not allow foreign carriers to operate over domestic routes, nor does it allow more than 25 percent of an American air carrier to be owned by foreign nationals. It would be unlawful for the United States Government to award such rights to the British. Yet you ask, \\"why is the State Department fighting the British demands?\\"   The British, in the talks on the use of London's Heathrow Airport that are the subject of your editorial, have not asked for the right to serve United States domestic markets or to own United States carriers.   The British have far more gateways (22) in the United States than the other European countries combined. (United States airlines have three gateways in Britain.) They aren't \\"seeking the right to be competitors\\" -- they are competitors.   British Airways has never been known to drive down ticket prices. On the other hand, the British Government rejected more than 260 low fares filed in the last six months by United States carriers for service between the United States and Britain, because they simply were lower than British carriers. United States domestic fares have for years been lower than the fares for comparable distances in Europe, including the British. Fares within Britain are also higher than in the United States.   The United States Government could agree with the British to increase the number of British carriers allowed to serve the United States. However, I find it extremely hard to believe that such a United States carrier, or carriers, would or even could offer service at the lower fares you seem to envision.    You seem to imply that the British would in some way inject competition that is not present in the marketplace. The real live restrictions between the United States and Britain that affect competition have been insisted upon by the British. To reach agreement, they required provisions regulating the number of United States-carrier designations, the number of gateways and the number of routes to third countries.   They also insist on maintaining the antiquated system of fare approvals by government. The United States, on the other hand, has always favored getting rid of capacity and designation controls, and allowing freedom to price. DONALD C.

As Mr. Whitcomb suggests in his description of the presentation -- \\"a conducted tour by an English gentleman through the backways of Tin Pan Alley\\" -- this is pop music of the teens and 20's delivered with a British accent and in terms of a British music-hall performance. Accompanying himself on the ukulele while Mr. Waldo plays the piano, Mr. Whitcomb sings a melange of period songs with bright-eyed enthusiasm. They bounce from turn-of-the-century ballads that preceded Berlin to British World War I songs and a miscellany of novelty songs, some of which were written by Berlin.   He eventually takes an autobiographical turn with a 1951 song, \\"Kiss Me, Baby,\\" which lured him to the United States when he heard Tennessee Ernie Ford's recording of it, and a rock song of his own, \\"You Turn Me On,\\" which made the hit parade in 1965.   Mr. Whitcomb wisely keeps his helter-skelter program moving rapidly. But when Mr. Waldo had the opportunity to move into the spotlight, he makes his piano solo of \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" and his oddly dark, disgruntled singing of Berlin's \\"Blue Skies\\" the only strong presentation of the evening's two primary subjects.

The island, 21 miles long and 14 miles wide, is a former British colony that was granted independence in 1966 and has a population of 249,000, relatively large for the Caribbean. It stands outside the arc of islands called the Lesser Antilles, 100 miles to the west, which form a dividing line between the calm Caribbean and the Atlantic surge. Barbados gets the best of both worlds: on the western side an endless sandy shoreline and an azure sea, on the eastern side a rugged, breezy coastline with white&#8208;topped rollers, good for experienced surfers but not so safe for a lazy swim. Barbados is a coral island, flat compared to the wild, volcanic terrain of the Antilles, but it does have 1,100&#8208;foot Mount Hillaby, which is high enough for you to admire both coastlines from.

With the definite exception of ''Nicholas Nickleby'' and the recently opened ''Crimes of the Heart'' and ''The Dresser,'' Broadway has barely left the starting gate. But away from Broadway, in small but very legitimate playhouses covering the length of Manhattan, the new season already is marked by a panoply of outstanding theater. The range runs from a perfect two-character one-act play, Shirley Lauro's ''Open Admissions'' at the Ensemble Studio Theater to a stage-sweeping four-and-one-halfhour, two-part epic ''Peer Gynt'' at the C.S.C.  Repertory.   The plays being shown on the smaller stages derive from the most diverse geographic, ethnic and artistic sources. The works are American urban and country western","excerpt":"British, Chinese-American and Americanized Japanese; monologues and multi-media; naturalistic, surrealistic and experimental, and they deal with, among other subjects, Catholic education, colonialism, fragmented and extended families, assimilation and bisexuality.   Interestingly, two of this season's apparent Broadway successes, ''Mass Appeal'' and ''Crimes of the Heart,'' were first seen by New York audiences at the Manhattan Theater Club.
