(This makes it just like any other day, but never mind.) I suppose people do other things -- go to parties, accompany their children on trick-or-treating rounds -- but the holiday offers a perfect opportunity to sample the vast and diverse traditions of horror cinema.    So Monday night, you could stay home and scare yourself silly watching the ghouls come through the television set in ''POLTERGEIST,'' which will be broadcast on TCM at 8, Eastern time","excerpt":"5, Pacific time. Or you could sort through the pile of horror DVD's released last week in anticipation of Halloween viewing. One that jumps out is Warner Brothers' ''HOUSE OF WAX'' twofer ($35.98), featuring both the 1953 and the 2005 versions. VINCENT PRICE and PARIS HILTON in your living room on a single night -- now that's scary.    A strong stomach -- and a brain willing to suspend expectations of logic or coherence -- is necessary to appreciate the work of Italian ''giallo''-master DARIO ARGENTO. His breakthrough 1969 horror picture, ''THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE,'' with a score by ENNIO MORRICONE, is available on DVD in its uncut Italian version. But if you don't mind seeing it in slightly trimmed American theatrical form, it will be shown on Monday at 7 p.m. at TWO BOOTS PIONEER THEATER in the East Village, along with Mr. Argento's sublime ''DEEP RED,'' from 1974. That movie, starring DAVID HEMMINGS as a jazz pianist investigating a series of gruesome murders, is a bravura exercise in color and style -- a terrific and terrifying example of the triumph of sensation over sense. 155 East Third Street, East Village, (212)591-0434.

The southward expansion of the Chinese empire in the first millennium B.C. drove the Vietnamese peoples southward into northern Vietnam (Tonkin). The area came under direct Chinese rule in 111 B.C. Chinese rule endured, with some interruptions, until A.D. 948; thereafter, Vietnam was independent under strong Chinese influence. The Hindu-Buddhist kingdom of Annam, in central Vietnam, gradually increased in size and power at the expense of Tonkin and the Khmer empire and Champa, to the west and south. In 1558 the kingdom of Annam split, with independent courts established at Hanoi, controlling Tonkin and the Red River valley, and Hue, in central Vietnam. A remnant of the old Champa state remained independent in the Mekong delta in the south. In 1802 the monarchy was reunited, with the court at Hue controlling all of Vietnam and exercising hegemony over Cambodia. European penetration of the region began in the 16th century; by the early 19th century, France was the dominant foreign power in Indochina. Efforts to establish French military control began in 1858‚Äì59 with the establishment of a colony in Cochin China, in southern Vietnam. Campaigns in the Red River valley in 1873 and 1882 were complicated by Chinese intervention and the determined resistance of the Vietnamese court. In 1884 separate protectorates were established in Tonkin and Annam; in 1887 those, along with Cochin China and Cambodia, were combined into the Union of Indochina under French colonial rule. Rubber plantations were established, and rice and timber exports were under French control. A nationalist rebellion under Phan Boi Chau was suppressed in the early 20th century. Nationalist resistance to French colonialism continued, resulting in the creation in 1939 of the Vietminh, or Independence League. In 1940 Japanese troops occupied French Indochina, with the collaboration of colonial administrators loyal to the Vichy regime. The Vietminh spearheaded anti-Japanese guerrilla resistance and in 1945 forced the abdication of King Bao Dai, head of a pro-Japanese puppet state. In 1945 France reoccupied Indochina; in 1946 the leader of the Vietminh, Ho Chi Minh, became president of a separatist government at Hanoi. France ceded local autonomy to Tonkin and Annam but sought to retain Cochin China as a colony. Fighting between the French and the Vietminh resumed. On July 1, 1949, the French reinstalled Bao Dai as king of Vietnam, and in February 1950 recognized the independence of Vietnam within the French Union. Ho Chi Minh's republican government also claimed control of all of Vietnam. Fighting between the two rivals culminated in the French defeat at Dienbienphu on May 7, 1954. An armistice was concluded according to which the country was partitioned at a demilitarized zone at latitude 17¬∞ north, the northern part going to the Communist-controlled Vietminh government, the southern to Bao Dai. Nearly one million refugees, including many ethnic Chinese, fled from the north to the south. An international conference in Geneva agreed that elections would be held throughout Vietnam in 1956. In June 1954 Ngo Dinh Diem became premier of South Vietnam; full sovereignty in the south was transferred by France to the Vietnamese government in December 1954. In October 1955 Diem held elections in the south that resulted in the dismissal of Bao Dai as king and the proclamation of an independent Republic of Vietnam. The scheduled elections of 1956 were never held. French troops withdrew from South Vietnam in that year. Fighting continued in the south, as the Vietminh-backed National Liberation Front (Vietcong) sought to overthrow the Diem government. On Dec. 31, 1959, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north adopted a new constitution calling for the reunification of the country; northern aid to the Vietcong increased significantly, as did American aid to the south. After 1962 American military advisers increased in number and combat exposure. In 1963 widespead demonstrations, under Buddhist leadership, led to a coup on Nov. 1‚Äì2 in which Diem was deposed and assassinated. A series of short-lived military regimes followed until Sept. 1967, when Nguyen Van Thieu was elected president. U.S. air strikes against North Vietnam began in 1964. In the same year, the flow of troops and supplies from north to south increased. American combat troops entered the war in 1965. Despite U.S.-South Vietnamese superiority in arms and troops, and total control of the air, Vietcong control over the countryside increased. Both Operation Phoenix, in which antigovernment rural leaders were assassinated, and the establishment of fortified strategic hamlets to control the rural population, failed to reverse the tide. The combined Vietcong-North Vietnamese Tet Offensive in early 1968 resulted in serious losses for South Vietnamese and American forces. The war spread to Laos and to Cambodia, the latter bombed in 1969. American air strikes in North Vietnam were stepped up, and U.S. troop strength reached a maximum of 543,000 in 1969. In July 1969 a series of U.S. troop withdrawals began, and secret talks were initiated in search of a negotiated settlement of the war. Following heavy U.S. bombardment of the north in 1972, a cease-fire agreement was signed in Paris by South Vietnam, North Vietnam, the Vietcong, and the United States on Jan. 27, 1973. It was never implemented, but the American withdrawal continued. In early 1975 South Vietnamese forces collapsed in the face of a series of North Vietnamese-Vietcong offensives. Remaining U.S. personnel were evacuated, and Saigon fell on Apr. 30, 1975. Hundreds of thousands of refugees (‚Äúboat people‚Äù) fled the country over the next decade. Following the fall of Saigon, the country was occupied by northern troops and administrators. Businesses were nationalized, agriculture collectivized, and tens of thousands of people sent to labor camps for ‚Äúreeducation.‚Äù A unified National Assembly met in 1976, and the country was officially reunified on July 2, 1976, under the existing government of the north. Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City. A Soviet naval base was established at the former U.S. base at Cam Ranh Bay. In 1978 Vietnamese troops occupied Cambodia ousting the government of Pol Pot and installing Heng Samrin as premier. In February 1979 China launched an unsuccessful attack over its border with Vietnam to display displeasure with the invasion of Cambodia and with the treatment of ethnic Chinese in Vietnam. In 1988 Vietnam pledged to withdraw its troops from Cambodia and completed the withdrawal in September 1989. Vietnam's communist government ruled through the party's powerful Central Committee; no strong personalities emerged to replace the leaders of the wartime generation. The economy was functioning only at a basic level, with the infrastructure in disrepair and agriculture hampered by excessive collectivization. The collapse of the Soviet Union brought about a drastic reduction of the Soviet aid that had kept the Vietnamese economy afloat. Facing economic ruin, Vietnam's leadership eventually turned a blind eye to individual private enterprise. By 1992 the government was encouraging foreign investment. Resumption of contacts with the U.S. had been precluded by American insistence that Vietnam account more fully for American prisoners of war and troops missing in action. But high-level talks on the normalization of relations and the Cambodian question opened in 1990, and the success of those negotiations helped to open diplomatic channels between Vietnam and the U.S. In 1994, Pres. Clinton, satisfied with Vietnam's efforts to account for POWs and MIAs, ended the 19-year U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam; the following day, American firms were operating in Ho Chi Minh City. In July 1995, full diplomatic relations were established. In October 1995, Vietnam's National Assembly adopted its first-ever national civil code under the Communist government. The document spelled out rights to land, personal property, inheritances, and raising capital. Close to 90 percent of the Assembly members voted in favor of the code, which went into effect in July 1996. In recent years the Government has encouraged many Western companies to build factories and open businesses but poverty and the Asian financial crisis slowed progress. In July 2000 the U.S. and Vietnam signed a far-reaching trade agreement. In April 2001, the Central Committee of the Communist Party appointed a new Secretary General, Nong Duc Manh, with the aim of modernizing the economy (especially the industrial side) and ending corruption. By rumor, Nong is an illegitimate son of Ho Chi Minh. In Dec. 2001 Vietnam took two steps toward its goal of joining the W.T.O.: a trade agreement with the U.S. and the granting to private investors equal access to bank credit with the public sector. The the Communists had no intention of easing their political control, however, was made clear by the May 2002 ‚Äúelections‚Äù to the National Assembly in which the Communists carried 447 of 498 seats.

Modern Guatemala was the heart of the Maya civilization that began early in the Christian era and flourished from the fourth to the 10th centuries. From the 11th century on there were two major powers, the Cakchiquel and the Quich√©. They were overthrown by the Spanish who invaded from the north in 1524. The captaincy general of Guatemala was the seat of Spanish military authority in Central America until the 19th century. After an earthquake destroyed Antiqua in 1773, the capital was moved to Guatemala City. Guatemala was the center of the United Provinces of Central America after independence was gained from Spain (1821) and Mexico (1823). The United Provinces collapsed after an uprising by Rafael Carrera, and Guatemala became a separate country in 1838. The Liberal party held power from 1851 to 1944. There was considerable economic development under the repressive regimes of Manuel Estrada Cabrera (1898‚Äì1920) and Jorge Ubico (1931‚Äì44). Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo was elected president in 1945. He was succeeded, with strong Communist support, by Jacobo Arbenz, who was deposed in 1954 by a U.S.-backed coup led by Col. Carlos Castillo Armas. The military has ruled either directly or indirectly since then, although democratic rule resumed officially in 1986. A civil war involving the army, right-wing death squads, and the antigovernment guerrilla group known as the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union (URNG) began in 1960 and intensified through the 1980's, resulting in the deaths of more than 100,000 civilians. In May 1993, Pres. Jorge Serrano Elias, backed by the military, suspended the constitution in an effort to crack down on labor and student strikes. Eight days later, in the face of overwhelming popular discontent and international protest, the military replaced Serrano with Atty. Gen. for Human Rights Ramiro de Leon Carpio. In March 1994, the URNG and the government reached an agreement to end the 30-year-old civil war, but talks stalled for a year until the two sides could agree on a pact amending the constitution to defend Indian rights. Meanwhile, the United States cut off military aid to Guatemala for its failure to prosecute security officers for crimes committed during the civil war. In January 1996, URNG called a cease-fire during elections, in which √Ålvaro Arz√∫ Irigoyen won a narrow but clear victory over a candidate considered a puppet of the military. The new government immediately purged the military of its most corrupt members, and made plans to privatize all aspects of the economy. The 36-year civil war seemed to end when the last 200 rebels turned in their arms in May 1997. The April 1998 slaying of a Catholic bishop, a human rights advocate who had authored a report blaming 80 percent of the killings and kidnappings upon the military and right-wing paramilitary forces, remained unsolved a year later, as the lead prosecutor and two successive judges resigned in an atmosphere of threats. In Feb. 1999, an independent report, more comprehensive than Bishop Gerardi's, accused the army and paramilitaries of over 90 percent of the civil war abuses. In May 1999, as the first prosecutions of military and security forces were beginning, Guatemalan voters rejected all the constitutional changes proposed in the 1996 peace. In November elections for Congress, they gave a majority to the Guatemalan Republican front; then, in December, they overwhelmingly elected its candidate as president.

Recent excavations on Cyprus indicate a human presence at least 10,000 years ago. Mycenean (Greek) culture flourished in the second millenium B.C. Phoenicians colonized the island in the 10th century B.C., and it remained a major entrep√¥t for eastern Mediterranean trade. Annexed to Rome in 58 B.C. it was later part of the Byzantine Empire until the English Richard I (Lion Hearted) established a crusader state in A.D. 1191. The Lusignan dynasty ruled until 1489, when Cyprus was annexed by Venice. It was subsequently conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1571. In 1878 the Congress of Berlin placed Cyprus under British administration. In 1914 it was annexed outright by Great Britain and was made a British colony in 1925. From 1945 to 1948, the British used Cyprus as a detention area for ‚Äúillegal‚Äù Jewish immigrants to Palestine. After 1947 the Greek Cypriot community continued its long-standing agitation for union (enosis) with Greece, a policy strongly opposed by the Turkish Cypriot community. Communal violence broke out in 1954‚Äì55. In 1960 Cyprus was granted full independence under an agreement that forbade either enosis or partition and included guarantees of the rights of both Greeks and Turks. Attempts by the president, Archbishop Makarios, to alter the constitution to favor the Greek majority provoked further communal clashes in 1964, when a U.N. peacekeeping force was sent to the island. On July 15, 1974, a military coup by officers favoring union with Greece deposed the Makarios government. On July 20 Turkey invaded Cyprus and, after the collapse of cease-fire talks in August, occupied the northern two-fifths of the island. In 1975 the Turkish government announced a de facto partition of Cyprus; the northern territory was proclaimed the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, under Pres. Rauf Denktash. Makarios returned as president of the Republic of Cyprus, which was thus reduced in size, and remained in office until his death in 1977. He was succeeded by Spyros Kyprianou. Some 200,000 Greek Cypriots were expelled from the Turkish sector to the Republic; many Turks fled from the Republic to the Turkish sector. With a return of political stability, renewed foreign investment, and a customs union negotiated with the EEC, the Republic's economy has prospered, led by agriculture, light manufacturing, and tourism. In the Turkish sector, the economy remains stagnant, hampered by the loss of population, wartime damage, and stringent economic controls. The Turkish sector proclaimed its independence as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983, but the new republic has not gained international recognition. The 1998 decision of the E.U. to invite Cyprus to apply for membership and to deny Turkey's application heightened tensions. In June, both Greece and Turkey sent aircraft to Cyprus and the newly-reelected government of Pres. Clerides sought anti-aircraft missiles from Russia. But by December Cyprus had cancelled plans for deployment, at the urging of Greek Premier Simitis. With the peaceful resolution of so serious a crisis, it became possible for Greek-Turkish relations (the key to reunification of Cyprus) to improve, as they did in the January 2000 accords on the Aegean environment, immigration, tourism and the like. Reunification talks continued through March 2003 but to no avail. So the E.U.'s treaty with Cyprus, signed in April 2003, concerns only the Greek portion of the island. (There, 83-year old Pres. Clerides had lost his re-election to Tassos Papadopoulos in February.) Still, Turkish Cyprus opened its border in April, while Greek Cyrus dropped its trade sanctions.

Budget cuts have forced other festivals to reduce their programs or to economize by increasing the number of co-productions and offering more revivals or fewer highly paid stars. Aix-en-Provence, for example, has dropped all but one of three planned new productions, while the Maggio Musicale in Florence will be giving three of five planned operas in concert form. \\n\\nOn the other hand, some festivals are flourishing. Edinburgh's festival will be larger than in previous years as a result of the restoration of the Edinburgh Festival Theater, which now has the largest stage in Britain and seats 1,900. In Italy, Ravenna said its festival would be larger than last year's, and officials at Spoleto and Verona say that neither has suffered much from the recession and that this year's programs will be as ample and versatile as ever.

While Rossini receives the most attention, at least four other composers are being remembered. Three of them -- Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud and Germaine Tailleferre -- all born in 1892, were members of the Paris group of musicians known as Les Six. They are honored at Aix-en-Provence, Bordeaux, Zurich and Lucerne. Another Frenchman, Edouard Lalo, is remembered at Bratislava and Ottorino Respighi is remembered at the Respighi Festival in Umbria, Italy, on the 100th anniversary of his death. \\n\\nRemarkably, Mieczyslaw Horszowski, also born in 1892, has continued to perform. He is scheduled to play at Lucerne's Festival, bridging the decades with a piano recital. A retrospective in Prague is dedicated to compositions of the 80-year-old John Cage.

The analysis went like this: Roman Catholics gained 3, Methodists lost 1, Episcopalians lost 4, Baptists gained 4, Presbyterians remained the same and Jews gained 2.   These were the tallies by religious denomination of the newly elected members of Congress compared with the religious makeup of the members elected in 1988.   The changes did not significantly alter the ranking of the top six denominations represented. In the new Congress there will be 142 Catholics, 75 Methodists, 59 Episcopalians, 59 Baptists, 51 Presbyterians and 41 Jews.   The news service noted that the \\"changing religious character of Congress typifies the changing religious landscape of the nation.\\" Nationally, mainline Protestant denominations like the Episcopalians have been losing members, while Catholics and Evangelicals, especially Southern Baptists, have been growing in number and influence.   Sexual Harassment     The Congressional study is only one of several surveys on religion that have been made public in recent days.   A new study of United Methodists shows that three of four of the denomination's female ministers report incidents of sexual harassment, often by other members of the clergy and sometimes at church socials.   The study, conducted by the denomination's General Council on Ministries, is based on responses from 1,578 Methodists, both men and women, including members of the clergy, church employees, laity and college and seminary students. The highest incidence of sexual harassment, 77 percent, was reported by female ministers. Of those, 41 percent said the harassment came from other ministers. In 31 percent of the cases, the setting for the incident was a social function sponsored by the church.   In describing her experiences, one clergywoman interviewed in the survey said: \\"The kinds of sexual harassment that disturb me more are the actions of my brother clergy, who seem to offer unsolicited looks, touches and comments to the more attractive clergywomen fairly frequently. We sometimes wonder if they do that with congregations as well.\\"   The Rev. Mearle L. Griffith, the survey's chief researcher, said the high incidence of harassment was surprising but that it might, in part, be explained by the greater awareness among members of the clergy of such behavior.   The study defines sexual harassment as \\"any sexually related behavior that is unwelcome, offensive or which fails to respect the rights of others.\\" A list of \\"unwanted sexual behaviors\\" listed in the survey included \\"unsolicited suggestive looks or leers, pressure for dates or activities with a sexual overtone,\\" or \\"actual sexual assault or rape.\\"  Jewish Growth     Jewish organizations are also conducting tallies.   Among the most ambitious of these is the Jewish Population Survey, which was made public in November by the Council of Jewish Federations, a national association of 200 community groups. The study shows that there are 5.5 million Jews in the United States, as against 5.2 million in a 1970 survey by the same organization.    An additional 600,000 people said that they had been reared as Jews or were of Jewish parentage, but that they now practiced another religion. Together, these 6.1 million people -- those who describe themselves as Jews by birth, conversion or ethnic origin -- represent an increase from the combined total of 5.4 million in the 1970 survey.   The study, conducted by ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa., was based on contacts with 125,000 randomly selected American households. The results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Among the other findings were these:   *Twenty-eight percent of Jewish households consist of a person living alone, either widowed, divorced or single.    *Twenty-seven percent of Jewish adults have visited Israel at least once.    *Seventy-seven percent of Jewish households contributed to charity in 1989","excerpt":"50 percent of the households gave to Jewish charities.   The study was conducted under the direction of Dr. Barry A. Kosmin, the council's director of research.  Return to Traditions     A survey of 425 Reform Jewish congregations, to be announced this weekend, shows that many of the traditions once abandoned by the Reform movement, the most liberal branch of Judaism, are coming back into vogue.   Yarmulkes, for example, are provided at 59 percent of the congregations questioned, and virtually all report that they light Sabbath candles before Friday night service. In addition, more than 20 percent of the congregations report that they require board members to attend services regularly or take a course in basic Judaism.   The survey was conducted by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Central Conference of American Rabbis. Rabbi Sanford Seltzer, director of the study, said the responses \\"would appear to confirm anecdotal reports that traditional ceremonies now play a larger role\\" in Reform congregations. These trends do not mark \\"a return to Orthodoxy,\\" he said, but rather a quest for \\"new dimensions of spirituality.\\"  Women's Ritual Rights     Finally, a new survey by the Women's League for Conservative Judaism shows that women are steadily gaining in Conservative congregations, where they are increasingly being counted with men as part of the quorum required for prayer, and are being given the honor of being called to the Torah to say a blessing.   Of 706 congregations responding to the questionnaire, 68 percent said they counted women in the quorum of 10, or minyan. In a similar survey in 1987, 61 percent said that they counted women.   And 66 percent of the congregations said they called women to the Torah, up from 61 percent in 1987. An additional 7 percent said they gave women the honor only on special occasions like bar mitzvahs or bas mitzvahs, down from 9 percent in 1987.   In analyzing the results, Edya Arzt, the league's director of education, said, \\"There has been a consistent move toward granting full ritual rights to women even in the most traditional of our synagogues.\\" Religion Notes"},{"year":"2006","title":"10 P.M.

Now that his sons, Robert Jr. and Tom, are running the business, Mr. Dorsi had time to answer some questions about his hometown.   Q.  So what's Long Hill like?   A.  We've got a little of everything. We have wooded areas. We've got the Passaic River, and we've got the Great Swamp, which runs into Long Hill and Chatham and Madison. People are always running and bicycle riding, especially in the summer, when a lot of people come from the city and get off at the train station with their packs.   Before, we had Italian and Polish and Armenian people, mostly. Now, it's just mixed. We're just getting better people all the time -- better educated, more money. We don't have anyone here who's that famous. Leo the Lion, the MGM symbol, was pretty heavy here about a year ago. People came from all over to see where he was buried. Now it's died out; I heard the owners took the headstone away because they want to sell the property.   Q.  What are people in Long Hill talking about these days?   A.  A few years ago, the new people didn't like the name Passaic Township, which was what Long Hill was called for a long time. So there was a vote, and people changed the name to Long Hill. Long Hill sounds a little richer, like Short Hills. People used to get us confused with Passaic, over there near Clifton. The old people didn't like this when the name changed; they never said Passaic Township, they just said Millington, Stirling, Gillette, Meyersville or Homestead Park -- those are the villages that are part of Long Hill. But now you never hear anything about Passaic. People say either Long Hill or Stirling or Gillette.   Property is worth a lot of money here, and people are worried about all the stores coming in now, like T.J. Maxx and Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's. All the land is just about saturated. They're building a new development now -- Stirling Manor, I think it's called. They're going to build about 60 homes on the hill, and the cheapest you can get is $375,000.   Q.  Has the town changed?   A.  Years ago, you knew everyone by their first name, their last name, where they lived. Now you don't know. You do meet a lot of nice people; we've got a lot of lawyers, dentists and doctors and F.B.I. people. You see almost the same people every day, and you try to talk to them a little. We have the lottery here at the store; that brings in a lot of people. It's just that everybody's in a hurry.   TV and the malls have changed a lot of people. These new people have got a landscaper and a gardener; they sleep late on Sunday, take the kids to the mall, stay all day. It isn't like when families got up early, went together to get a bun or rolls, got the morning paper, went back home and read it at home. We open at 6:30 every day. The early birds are all old-timers coming in for coffee, doughnuts and rolls. We try to satisfy everybody; that's what kept me here so long. I want to retire, but my sons always need help.

It was enough to make an old China hand like John Paton Davies, now 91, wonder whether the ever-emotional dynamic between the United States and China was headed into ''another era in which we fear the Dragon.''    The days when Mr. Davies and his State Department colleagues were purged in the peculiar madness of the McCarthy era for arguing that the Chinese Communists would be around for a while seem as remote today as pre-revolutionary Beijing. But the underlying fear that rattled the country in those years -- later to take the form of oscillating uncertainty about how to think about China and the kinds of threats it might pose -- has really never lifted.

This is a celebration, no doubt about it. Touchy moments in the station's history are either skimmed over lightly or just ignored. But the collection of highlights, packaged with time-capsule skill, encompasses an often fascinating review of both television and New York City.    Channel 2 first went on the air in July 1941, just five months before the United States would enter World War II, with the call letters WCBW. Only 400 New Yorkers had television sets to receive the station's 15 hours of programming each week. The first broadcast, lasting 15 minutes, offered glimpses of paintings from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1948, William S. Paley purchased the station to launch the CBS Television Network. Television as we know it today began to evolve. And as Jim Jensen, co-host with Michele Marsh for tonight's program, puts it: \\"Rembrandt it is not.\\" Review/Television","excerpt":"50 Years of Channel 2: More Than Lights And Wires in a Box"},{"year":"1953","title":"JAKE BACHTOLD was rewarded with a golden New York Central Railroad pass yesterday -- for fifty years of clock watching, of all things.
