NEW JERSEY DAILY BRIEFING","excerpt":"Cellular Tool Against Abuse"},{"year":"1994","title":"CHER has something for her fans. The singer-actress turned cosmetics and hair-product pitchwoman is starting a line of home furnishings and accessories to be sold by mail. Why not, considering that Cher has renovated some 15 houses in the last 25 years?   But what could her mail-order furnishings possibly look like? The options were many, considering all of Cher's personas since the long-haired naivete of \\"I Got You, Babe\\" in 1964. Imagine the possibilities: leopard-skin bedspreads (Classic Cher)","excerpt":"cellulite-free foot poufs (Cher Lite); tattoed divans (Chez Cher) and black Bob Mackie-sequined draperies (Cher Deco).    A meeting with Bill Sammeth, Cher's personal manager, took place in a hotel suite with a view of Central Park. His client, out on a shopping spree, sent over a tie for him from Barneys New York. It was her day off from shooting \\"Faithful,\\" a movie in which she stars with Ryan O'Neal.    It seemed likely that Cher's collection would be the sheets and towels that are the touchstone of new celebrity product lines. But no. Here was a mail-order catalogue with a theme: medieval times.    \\"Cher thinks that people are getting into a more romantic look,\\" Mr. Sammeth said as he flipped through the extravagantly photographed catalogue of the collection, called Sanctuary. The book opens with a picture of a stony, dungeonlike space dimly lighted by torches.   There is a lamp with a chain-mail shade, a wine-velvet ottoman roped like a monk, wrought-iron bedsteads with Gothic arches, frosted glass goblets that Cher designed and innumerable votive candles and incense holders.   \\"Cher picked every single item either from her own home or from things she's seen around in stores, museums, wherever,\\" Mr. Sammeth said.   Prices are moderate, topping out at $1,150 for a Gothic-style metal-and-wood bed. The catalogue is full of three-fors (as in one perfume bottle for $28; three for $70) and clever products that a Harvard M.B.A. might spin off. For instance, the Moorish-style pattern taken from a tile has been adapted into both a trivet and a box made of chocolate.    The catalogue, or as Cher prefers to call it, a \\"coffeetable book you can order from,\\" opens with a personal letter. Cher writes: \\"I have worked hard, used my own money and, basically, put this baby together with sweat, long hours, late nights and a few dedicated fellow workers in my own home (which looks kinda like a warehouse now).\\"   The catalogue will be mailed to some 350,000 people whose names have been culled from 35 mailing lists, among them Horchow's, Robert Redford's Sundance collection and those of various museums. To select items, Cher and her scouts combed through catalogues, trade shows, boutiques and showrooms.    In London, she met Clyde Wainright, a curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and became entranced with his recent exhibition on the work of A. W. Pugin, a 19th-century architect who popularized pointy Gothic arches for country estates.   Mitchell Gold, a furniture manufacturer in High Point, N.C., has provided several pieces for the catalogue, including a velvet fainting chaise that Madame Recamier would have been happy to collapse upon. Mr. Gold said he thought Cher was taking her new line of business seriously in terms of prices and quality.    \\"They're going slow; there's no gimmick,\\" he said without a hint of irony. \\"Her main thing is that she does not want to disappoint people.\\"   Not surprisingly, Cher's public relations representatives say the same, adding that her image of the Sanctuary customer is a women between 20 and 45. That explains the jewelry. There is a trove of it; many heavy chains carry Maltese crosses.    \\"Cher has these on right now as we speak,\\" Mr. Sammeth said reverently, pointing out a pair of cross-shaped earrings.    But the catalogue is not all femme-fatale stuff. There is also a faux-bone plastic knife set, reproduced from Cher's own kitchenware.   The medieval theme, one woman's commitment to a look that had its day eight centuries ago, never lets up. And it's coming by mail at the end of September, just in time for Christmas shopping.    In a moment of candor, Cher's manager admitted that it had not yet been decided how many of each item to produce. He added, \\"Cher thinks it will either be a hit, or the biggest memento she's ever bought.\\" Cher's Gothic Look, by Mail"},{"year":"1962","title":"Wagenknecht, E: The Movies in the Age of Innocence Celluloid History","excerpt":"Celluloid"},{"year":"1939","title":"Celluloid Corp strike called by Textile Workers Organizing Com STRIKE AT NEWARK PLANT","excerpt":"Celluloid Corp.
