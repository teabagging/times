As long as the city remains a mecca for the arts and the media, advertising will stay close by.   \\"We've looked at the possibility of moving the agency outside New York, and right now it just can't effectively be done,\\" said Graham Phillips, the chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. \\"The most creative people want to live in New York. They need the stimulus of things like the theater or simply the conversation at popular restaurants.\\"   The New York anchor to the commercial-production industry also seems firmly in place. Because an advertising campaign can change many times before the final version is set, many advertising executives said, agencies still need to remain near production houses so alterations can be made quickly.    But while many production companies are still in New York, they are increasingly doing the filming in locations like Canada or Australia, where the work costs less.    Currently, half the people in advertising in the United States work at New York agencies. But the total number of people working in the industry in New York has declined to 39,000 from a peak of 41,800 in 1985.    The industry is in the midst of a slowdown. Many clients are cutting their budgets and the overall rate of increase in advertising spending has fallen drastically during the last few years. This trend is expected to continue for at least another year.  'The Next Logical Move'    \\"Agencies are being squeezed by rising rents and taxes and falling compensation from clients,\\" said John O'Toole, the president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. \\"To cut costs, most agencies have moved from their expensive Madison Avenue locations to offices on the West Side and downtown. The next logical move will be out of Manhattan.\\"    During the next 5 to 10 years, some large agencies will probably relocate operations like accounting, but many agency executives think New York will continue to be an advertising center.   The hundreds of small and medium-size agencies seem eager to stay in the city. \\"Smaller agencies tend to attract more adventuresome people,\\" said Marty Weiss, the co-chairman of Weiss Whitten, one of the little companies. \\"Sure, New York is frightening, but that is part of what makes it creatively exciting.\\" New York City Is Hurt But Still Has Reserves","excerpt":"Advertising: Too Many Ties To Walk Away"},{"year":"1949","title":"VERA HAINES AFFIANCED I","excerpt":"Advertising' Firm Aide Will Be{I Bride of W.

OUTDOORS","excerpt":"Advice for Those Who Fish Through Ice"},{"year":"1993","title":"Jeff Torborg's travails began early in his tenure with the Mets. Here are a handful of his worst days on the job.  April 19, 1992    Torborg, less than a month into his tenure with the Mets, confesses to having underestimated the difficulty of managing in the National League. \\"Our pitcher always seems to be coming up,\\" Torborg said after a tactically suspect loss against the Expos 24 hours earlier. June 26, 1992   In a painful version of his daily radio show, Torborg is grilled about the coverup for Bobby Bonilla's phone call from the dugout the day before. The manager winds up apologizing to \\"all the New York media\\" for any lack of candor, real or perceived. Aug. 4, 1992    The Mets, only four games back of the Pirates and lacking their top players, respond to the manager's call for a \\"critical win\\" in Pittsburgh by losing in 12 innings. The Mets, who would wind up 4-14 on the season against the Pirates, go on to complete the decisive road trip 0-6 to fall hopelessly out of the race. Sep. 1, 1992    Torborg gets involved in a profane and physical confrontation with outfielder Vince Coleman on the field after Coleman was ejected for arguing a strike call. The scene dramatized what had been a season-long frustration for many Mets, namely that Torborg's failure to argue with umpires began to seem like a failure to stand up for his players. April 11, 1993    Torborg chooses not to discipline or criticize Bobby Bonilla after the outfielder's run-in with a reporter in the clubhouse at Shea Stadium. The Mets then go out and lose their third straight home game to the Astros.  April 25, 1993    The Mets squander a comeback from an 8-3 deficit and lose 9-8 to the Padres on an unearned run. April 26, 1993   Torborg opts to hide the cause of Dwight Gooden's shoulder injury after a clubhouse mishap shortly before Gooden is scheduled to start. It is later revealed that Vince Coleman inadvertently struck Gooden with a golf club while practicing his swing an hour before game time. April 29, 1993    Bret Saberhagen, who won't win a game against a non-expansion club before Torborg is fired, is bombed for three home runs in a 10-5 defeat to the Giants. The Mets commit five errors.  May 2, 1993    A second straight defeat in San Diego underscores another of the club's weaknesses: the bullpen is 0-10  May 8, 1993   Torborg, who said upon his hiring that all players would do all things his way, sees Bobby Bonilla fail to run full out from first base on an eighth-inning flyball by Howard Johnson, even though the Mets are trailing the Marlins by two runs. Torborg does not challenge Bonilla himself and ultimately has to act as a peacemaker after Bonilla flys into a rage at third base coach Mike Cubbage, who criticizes Bonilla's lack of effort on the field. Bonilla is neither fined nor reprimanded. May 9, 1993    After enduring the ignominy of having to identify a May series against the Marlins as critical, the Mets lose their second straight to the expansion club, securing occupancy of last place in the N.L. East. May 14, 1993    The Mets get a season-high 14 hits but lose to the Expos, 8-7. Frank Tanana gives up five runs on one hit in the first inning as errors and hit batsmen doom the Mets. The one-run loss is the first of three that weekend against the Expos. The Mets wind up 2-10 in one-run decisions under Torborg. May 17, 1993    \\"Jeff Must Go\\" is heard at Shea as the Pirates beat up Dwight Gooden and the bullpen in a 9-4 loss to the Pirates.   May 18, 1993    This time the Mets get 17 hits, but the ultimate result is a fifth straight loss, a 10-8 embarrassment to the Pirates that leaves New York at 12-25, the second worst record in baseball.
