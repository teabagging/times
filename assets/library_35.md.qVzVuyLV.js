The name is a reference to the park's cheerful animal motif, including daily \\"water animal\\" shows featuring various cartoon-like characters. Another of the park's best features is the highly visible lifeguard squad, 240 trained college students whose mission is to keep fun seekers out of trouble.   We pulled up in the parking lot at 9:30 A.M. on a scorching Monday in June -- my husband, Jamie, and I, our daughter, Anna, and our neighbors' two children, Anne and Eileen. Weekdays are the best time to visit, because crowds can be fierce. We began by stopping at each cluster of rides and pavilions as we came to it, but by the end of our nine-hour day we were giddily crisscrossing the park.

On March 15, for example, when that month's M.M.I. options died, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 14 points even though there was no significant market news. Previous expiration dates of the options have witnessed similar downward price ''spikes.''

His method seems to be that of accusing an innocent individual of the murders with the hope that the publicity will cause the real criminal to become careless and fall into the police trap.\\"Before Midnight\\" is never exciting, not even when the attractive Janet Holt screams or when the grandfather clock stops. It is just a puerile puzzle in which a zealous attempt is made to deceive the audience. An elderly man falls dead from the effects of an injection of cyanide of potassium. The question then is, of course, who could have used a hypodermic needle on the victim. It happens that Trent was present at the death. He had been called in because the murdered man had a premonition that his end would come that night. And he was right.To hint which of the characters is innocent of the murder of this man and subsequently of the stabbing of a Japanese, might result in this feature being less interesting than it already is. Even the Japanese is presumed to have something to do with the first killing, until a knife is pitched into his back. Then it is revealed that he is just as guiltless as the fair Janet Holt. Betty Blythe, the veteran queen of several silent pictures, portrays Mavis Fry, who, it might be said, has a very good reason for poisoning at least two men. Miss Blythe's performance is not especially impressive.Ralph Bellamy struggles with the part of Trent, but the dialogue often is unintentionally humorous. June Collyer is quite pleasing as Janet Holt and Claude Gillingwater makes the most of his rôole.The story is told in the form of a flashback by a police captain to an enthusiastic young sleuth.

This Friday, the third of the final month of the quarter, is the year's last triple expiration day, a quarterly phenomenon that exists when stock index futures, stock index options and individual stock options expire simultaneously. And, even though the last time such an event occurred -Sept. 19 - it was almost universally described as a ''non-event,'' the New York Stock Exchange and the S.E.C. are once again bracing themselves against the possibility that the ride could be bumpier this time.   On Sept. 19, barely a week after the market suffered its worst two-day loss in history, the anxiety that accompanied the arrival of triple witching hour proved unnecessary. About 25 percent of the shares traded that day changed hands in the last minute of trading, but the surge of trading only resulted in an 11.53-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.

Lewis. ''Just looking at what she was wearing, and sensing her inner style,'' he says, ''I could tell she would be a fabulous addition to the project.'' So when Atherton was asked to collaborate with the film's costume designer, Isis Mussenden, and others to help bring Tilda Swinton's White Witch character to terrifying life, she felt she was in her own fairy tale: Lewis's book was one of her childhood favorites, and Swinton was already one of her inspirations.    Guided by her belief that fantasy must be grounded in reality in order to be convincing, she referenced the natural world for both a crown of ice that gradually melts throughout the movie and a beautifully malevolent neckpiece made from the carcass of a black rooster. ''Instead of doodling her up with jewelry, I wanted something that was growing out of her,'' says Atherton, whose next show is in March 2006 at the Bortolami Dayan gallery.

For the Central, if you have not been following its recent history, has been a houseof horrors, of horse opera and prison-pent shriekers","excerpt":"with \\"Port of Shadows\\" it becomes the haunt of a drama that is all mood, atmosphere and impression. What the theatre's old habitués will say to the change is more than we dare report in these columns, the strictures against profanity being what they are; what the theatre's new patrons may think of it will depend entirely on the patron himself.If he is willing to waive temporarily the requirements he usually makes: swift tempo, a tidy dovetailing of plot, with the conflict clearly described and resolved and all the little plus and minus marks coming out even, he should find it one of the most engrossing and provocative films of the season. If he is unwilling to check his customary yardstick at the gate, he cannot avoid being confused and disappointed by a story that is no story at all, but is a sad philosophy, a conjuration of mood, with a conclusion that simply shrugs its shoulders in the gloom and murmurs \\"Such is life.\\" And which is the proper course? We refuse to answer, for there is no answer. All we can suggest is that a change of viewpoint occasionally can do no harm.The film is nothing more than a lament for the living expressed somberly by a camera greedy for shots of rain and fog, by a writer who has looked at life through gray-tinted glasses, seeing nothing but its drabness, its sordidness and the futility of those who expect anything more of it. Havre is its scene. Its central figure, the unsmiling embodiment of man's hopelessness, is a deserting French soldier who has come to the Port of Shadows out of the rain, dreaming miserably of finding sanctuary somewhere, possibly in Venezuela, where the liner warped to the quay is going. And, for a time, it seems almost as though life intended to give him a reprieve. Through a man's suicide he finds a wardrobe, a passport, passage money. A young girl's love leads him to hope for a decent future somewhere. And then, without reason, a snivelling coward, of whose existence he scarcely was aware, shoots him down and leaves him dying in the muddy streets.Cheerful? Well, certainly no less than the imagery, the monotoned performances of Jean Gabin as the deserter, Michele Morgan as the harbor girl, most of the others in the cast. There is a bitterness even in its humor—in the character of the tiny longshoreman whose ambition is some day to sleep between sheets in a clean bed, in that of the ship's doctor who once had wanted to be an artist, in that of the artist who could not paint a swimmer without seeing him drown and so drowned himself. No, it's a thorough-going study in blacks and grays, without a free laugh in it; but it is also a remarkably beautiful motion picture from the purely pictorial standpoint and a strangely haunting drama. As a steady diet, of course, it would give us the willies; for a change it's as tonic as a raw Winter's day.

Everything he does in the process, every gag he pulls, the simple plot of the screenplay and even the way he is got up is in the magnificent tradition of silent comedy.And, what's more, he's very good at it—very clever, inventive and adroit—and also judicious in picking good old comedy bits to imitate. His own brittle music-hall manner—his clearly affected nonchalance, which is constantly being embarrassed by his clumsy and complicated goofs—is aptly applied to situations that were long ago tried and proved by such masters as Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin and Harold Lloyd.Also in the tradition, he is playing an airtight character. He's an innocent, inexperienced Parisian bookworm who suddenly discovers girls. You know, those beautiful creatures a fellow takes out to restaurants, dances with, tries to embrace adroitly and with whom he inevitably gets confused.There is nothing complicated about him, nothing psychologically profound. He's the boy who didn't quite grow up, the nincompoop next door. But he's one of those self-inflating fellows with whom everyone can identify, male or female, and the comical flaps he gets into are easily recognized.Thus, when his suit is rejected by the family's Swedish maid (because, as is cleverly indicated, she doesn't understand French), he sallies forth in the get-up of an elegant boulevardier, beady eyes glistening, shoulders swaggering, on the lookout for dames.And, of course, encounters follow—with a bosomy creature in a park where there's plenty of room for maneuvering","excerpt":"with a girl in a restaurant where the error of mistaking a lipstick for a cigarette lighter starts a chain of comical goofs, and again with the girl of the first encounter whom he has to take home dead drunk, dragging her in and out of cabs and elevators, dropping things en route. Finally, he develops a Chaplinesque infatuation for a glamorous singer he first sees on television. But, of course, in the end, our hero gets the Swedish maid.Naturally, such a picture—again in the tradition—is a one-man show, and Mr. Etaix has compounded that condition by writing and directing it, too. In every department, he is able. But he does get a couple of good assists from Laurence Lignères as the girl who gets sozzled and Claude Massot and Denise Perronne as his parents who spend the whole time being anxious about him. Jean Paillaud has also provided an impudent musical score and what English subtitles are needed for the French dialogue are good.Mr. Etaix is a welcome newcomer who takes a place almost alongside the much too infrequent Jacques Tati and, for my taste, a few steps ahead of Jean-Pierre Cassel.

In three previous lightweight French farces—\\"The Five Day Lover,\\" \\"The Joker\\" and \\"The Love Game\\"—he has fervently recommended heroes who have toiled not, neither have they spun, yet they have flourished with the casualness of lilies. These heroes have all been played by Jean-Pierre Cassel.Now, in his latest, \\"Male Companion\\" (\\"Un Monsieur de Compagnie\\"), which opened at the Baronet yesterday, Mr. de Broca is celebrating a fellow who frankly shirks work with a fierce élan. Trained by an elegant uncle to perceive that the way to succeed is spend one's time idling and playing, this fellow just takes things as they come. The things are mostly chic, compliant females. And the fellow is again Mr. Cassel.Mr. de Broca has a wry thought and a fair enough formula for a film, but to spin it into winning entertainment a certain amount of work must be done, first by the scriptwriters and then the director, both of which Mr. de Broca is. And along toward the middle of the picture it looks as though he has adopted the hero's philosophy as his own.It starts out well enough with the loafer lodging himself cozily in the pad of a charitable friend's Montmartre mistress, whom Irina Demick appropriately enacts. Then he finds a nice home as the playmate of an eccentric aristocrat who is nuts about trains. There he helps operate the model system and sleeps in a room that is built like a compartment in a wagon-lits. And here, we might note, the picture reaches its comic peak.For Mr. de Broca has managed to develop this antic conceit into a whirligig of nonsense that has the frenzy of old-time slapstick farce. The aspect of two grown-up fellows, Mr. Cassel and Jean-Claude Brialy, rigged out in trainmen's uniforms and playing with small electric trains is a sight in itself. And the clatter of whistles, wheels and bells coming over the hi-fi, and the rocking of the compartment at night, or the pouring of smoke through the window when Mr. Cassel opens it, makes for some funny business. The two actors are up to it.But the hero and Mr. de Broca both seem to find this phase too much, and the picture falls into aimless nonsense when the exhausted loafer flees to Italy. Here he fumbles through various adventures—with a pizza-maker's wife, played by voluptuous Sandra Milo","excerpt":"with an attorney (Adolfo Celi), who is bereaved by the loss of a son but has five daughters to comfort him—and his guest; with a Greek connoisseur of paintings (Dalio), who also likes pretty and marriageable dames; with a charming secretary, played by Catherine Deneuve.There are random laughs in this last part. Mr. de Broca pulls a swiftie now and then, and Mr. Cassel is continually his breezy, beaming self. The scenery in Rome is delightful and the color is excellent. But the fun is progressively less lively. It apparently took too much work.Also on the bill is an engaging 20-minute documentary film, shot in Eastern Nigeria. It is entitled \\"The Ancestors\\" and it describes the ceremonial rituals the Nigerian bush natives perform, and the wood carvings they create in connection with the deaths of their foremost men. It tells a fascinating story of a tradition that is sure to pass. Anthropologists should love it. It is in color and was made by André Libik.

But the much-honored writer of historical novels is not joining the public debate about whither Europe. Rather, the slow coming together of nations has set her thinking along different lines because, even in this early stage, she sees change in Europe affecting her two great loves: language and history.

As Tudor, American Ballet Theater's founding choreographer, once said, he wanted to \\"feel\\" the music, not count it.  Feeling is certainly what \\"The Leaves Are Fading\\" is all about, and this 1975 Tudor masterpiece received a glowing performance from two different sets of principals at the Metropolitan Opera House. On Monday night, Marianna Tcherkassky, who will make her farewell to Ballet Theater after 26 years on Saturday night, was seen for the first time in New York in the leading female role. She was partnered with masculine grace by Robert Hill, while last Saturday afternoon, Amanda McKerrow and Wes Chapman led  a virtually all-new cast. In each performance, the tone of young love deepening into tenderness was marvelously sustained. Ms. Tcherkassky and Ms. McKerrow are, however, very different dancers and each brought her individuality to Tudor's expressive use of the classical idiom. Ms. Tcherkassky has excelled in 19th-century Romantic roles and she slipped naturally into the gestural flow of Tudor's neo-Romantic style. In the central duet, she looked properly ecstatic and impressed by Mr. Hill's flourish. If the  more passionate choreography had a few glitches in the partnering, every swoon and lift spoke of intensification of feeling. With at least four couples engaged in tricky partnering, \\"Leaves\\" presumes a high level of technique. Ms. McKerrow, at her best in neo-classical ballets, brought that level to the choreography and also superbly captured its lyricism.  Mr. Chapman was on her wavelength and danced with the same daring in his timing. Especially lovely was their exit in the duet. Here the ballerina, slowly dipped  head-down by her spinning partner, is finally carried off in profile at his side, head thrown back. Amplifying the love image are three other duets. There was a girlish sparkle and lightness to Yan Chen, dancing with a boyishly eager Angel Corella. Christina Fagundes and Andrei Dokukin, who also had a folk-flavored solo to the Dvorak music, were grand in their boldness. Maxim Belotserkovsky and Martha Butler were ill-matched but did well enough. On Monday, Ms. Tcherkassky stepped into Lar Lubovitch's \\"Brahms Symphony\\" as the girl in cherry red. Her main duet with Keith Roberts had the sweep and surge brought to it by the rest of the excellent ensemble.

Or they may just as well be disgusted by the silliness of its stereotypes of Polish-Americans returning to the old country.The heroes are brassy Americans of the cigar-chewing, \\"yeah, okay kid\\" type who go back to Poland with money virtually bulging out of their pockets and bent on accomplishing some purpose of a sentimental sort. One (who is constantly being distracted by pretty Polish girls, as though he were a small-time Dean Martin) is back to bring a conciliatory message from his father in America to an aging uncle. The two brothers haven't seen each other in 40 years, and a great deal of tkliwosc passes in their tape-recorded exchange.Another—an undertaker from Gary, Ind.—is back to find a wife in the beautiful Tatra Mountain village from which his parents came. (He gets pie-eyed drunk and ends up marrying the barmaid in the local inn.) And the third is back to gather soil from ancient battlefields to sell as souvenirs to Poles in America. (He is rebuked for not being interested in the places where partisans fought in World War II.)The whole thing is simple and obvious, in the manner of folk comedies that are built more on cliché incidents than on plausible characters. The heroes are just a bit more clownish than the presumably genuine Poles.Worth mentioning is Mitchell Kowal, who plays the fellow looking for a wife, because he is actually an American of Polish extraction who went to Poland to play in this film.

A good picture, too, as far as it goes","excerpt":"with Director Dovzhenko rallying the Red standard bearers around half a dozen thumping battle scenes, tossing some hearty Russian humor into his script and characterization. But it is short on drama and the unity we seek in drama. That seems a chronic Soviet disorder: nothing ever is quite rounded out, including their Five-Year plans.Whether the fight for Ukraine actually proceeded as \\"Shors\\" relates, this department (unblushingly we confess it) has no way of telling. But, according to \\"Shors,\\" the Red soldiers, led by Comrade Shors himself, won every battle but lost the war. At least it looks as if they had lost the war, for the final scene showed the brave revolutionists marching behind the cortege of a fallen leader, with the Whites spreading over the land \\"like a plague.\\" Comrade Shors, however, had this satisfaction: his school for Red Army commanders had turned out its first graduating class, and he could tell them, as Lenin had told him (cheers from the audience) that victory was sweeter than slavery, or some such thing.This probably sounds muddled, but so is the script. But that cannot stand in the way of one's appreciation, on the purely visual side, of the sheer magnificence of Dovzhenko's battle scenes on the snows, in the waving wheat fields, across the sand dunes and the bloody cobbles of the Ukraine. \\"Chapayev\\" had much the same quality, created much the same effect upon the spectator. If anything, Dovzhenko has improved the technique. He has achieved his sequences of sharp physical clash with more subtlety, relying on surprise and atmospheric contrast rather than upon \\"Chapayev's\\" more obvious use of photographic blacks and whites further to emphasize its conflicts.E. Samoilov has played Shors as liberally as the Russian school permits, by which we mean that we actually sense the existence of the individual beneath the uniform that strikes postures, quotes Lenin and harangues the soldiers before every battle. But Shors is far less important a part of his biography than Skuratov's blustering Batko Bozhenko, the martial Cossack who cannot read a map but knows how to win battles, who bellows like a bull in his moments of grief and takes a machine gun with him when he goes to make a diplomatic speech to the muzhiks of Kiev. Bozhenko is typical of the film itself: robust, vigorous and rather awkwardly put together.

The music had a sort of natural snap, an easygoing swing, an affable communal energy that became unpredictable and even raucous. What was surprising was that this youthful, slightly poppish music (the Symphonic Dances from \\"West Side Story\\") was being played by the oldest orchestra in the United States -- the New York Philharmonic, opening its gala 150th anniversary season with a gala benefit concert. The music written by Leonard Bernstein, the orchestra's last (and first) American-born music director, was also being conducted with enthusiastic verve by its German-born music director, Kurt Masur.   This mixture of old and new, of European and American, of type and style, is also what can make a great American orchestra. And the Philharmonic, with mixed success, wanted to give a composite view of its strengths in this opening event. Mr. Masur, just celebrating his first anniversary as music director, chose to make this concert not a grand invocation of the orchestra's achievements (that is, presumably, what this season's programming will be about), but a festive show, an entertainment.

So far as we could determine from our listening post in the stalls, there was not a single hiss for Squire Corder, nary a cheer for Carlos, the faithful lover, not one word of counsel from the patrons to guide the unfortunate Maria as she reached the half-dozen turning points in her tragic career.Callously they sat by while the hand-washing old Squire plied the village maiden with port and betrayed her. Not one soul whooped rapturously when the gypsy Carlos glared down his chin and breathed (stertorously) \\"an eye for an eye, a life for a life and blood for blood! I'll go, Squire Corder, but I shall return!\\" And—we hesitate to admit it—there was not a \\"fie-er for shame\\" when Farmer Marten drove his repentant child out into the storm, little reckoning—or even caring to reck—that she was to be kicked that night into a shallow grave by a fiend in human form.Tod Slaughter, the Corse Payton of London, is quite perfect as the ogling, lip-curling, 104 per cent impure Squire. Sophie Stewart will melt even the most adamantine heart (see the programs of yesteryear) as Maria, and there are other full-blown and mossgrown personifications of the varying shades of virtue and villainy by D. J. Williams, Clare Greet, Dennis Hoey, Eric Portman and the rest. All have been assembled at great expense—as the gentleman in the prologue confides—for your amusement. To make it really perfect, though, the World Cinema should install a bar and a hissing claque.

Trying to stuff Baker's nearly 70 years into a two-hour movie is perhaps futile to begin with. This effort, directed by Brian Gibson (\\"Drug Wars: The Camarena Story\\"), does cover a great deal of biographical territory. Beginning in 1969, when a penniless Baker and her 12 adopted \\"rainbow\\" children were being evicted from their castle in the Dordogne Valley, the film quickly flashes back to 1917, when a race riot in St. Louis left a terrified 11-year-old Josephine with \\"a knot in my stomach that never went away.\\" TV Weekend","excerpt":"With Josephine Baker Through a Long Life"},{"year":"1956","title":"Hazaz, H: Mori Sa'id With Unlimited Joy of the Lord","excerpt":"With Joy Of the Lord"},{"year":"1976","title":"BROOKVILLE, L.I., Aug. 28 &#8212","excerpt":"With Joy Slater riding, Wile E.
