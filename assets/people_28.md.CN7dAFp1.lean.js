DeMille's \\"Why Change Your Wife?\\" presented its second program for an indefinite run yesterday afternoon. The feature of the new bill is \\"Humoresque,\\" an adaptation by Frances Marion of Fannie Hurst's story of the same name, directed by Frank Borzage.Many, no doubt, are familiar with Miss Hurst's story, and, presumably, the photoplay follows its original in the main. At any rate, the picture begins in New York's lower east side, familiarly known, in popular fiction and provincial parlance, as the Ghetto. The first part of it is steeped in atmosphere, if that overworked word may again be called upon to explain that in a succession of scenes, broad street views and little intimate glimpses, the people of the story, their customs, habits, ways of living and variety of character and appearance, are brought to the screen, definitely, genuinely, memorably. Within a short time the spectator feels himself carried into the life of which the persons in the play are an integral part. The power of the motion picture thus to create atmosphere, more vividly, more convincingly, than is possible in written words, except those of rare masters, is not often so emphatically and delightfully demonstrated.For this, of course, first credit goes to the camera, but the machine would be of no use without its director and his associates, so to Mr. Borzage, Miss Marion and others must go praise. They, however, would have achieved little without competent players, and it is, therefore, to Vera Gordon as a Jewish mother, Dore Davidson as her husband, little Bobby Connelly as their son, Sidney Carlyle as a pathetic imbecile, and many others that no little credit must be given. In an excellent cast, Vera Gordon is conspicuous by her performance. She is the most genuine person in the story, seemingly a character from life, living. The others are the less alive only by comparison with her.These people, as they are in the first part of the picture, are the substance of the photoplay. They are a human family, mother and father, with numerous children, whose joys and troubles are mingled as they are, without doubt, in many homes. The chief reason for their being in a story is Leon Kantor, the little son who wants a violin for a birthday present and thereby convinces his mother that he is a musical genius. He gets the violin and becomes a genius, and from this point the story loses much of its character, becomes more conventional, and follows a usual course of fiction to a predetermined end. Now and then there are flashes of its early spirit, but for the most part, once all of the children are grown, and 'the family has moved uptown, the romance is not distinguished by its quality from many, many others. In the latter half of the narrative the heroine is Alma Rubens, and although her name is featured in the program, she has comparatively little to do. Vera Gordon remains the actual star of the work throughout. Gaston Glass, as Leon Kantor matured, is satisfactory.The \\"Humoresque\\" is preceded by interesting views of the Palestine of today, which dissolve, so to speak, into the singing of \\"Through the Ages\\" by Emanuel List and a chorus costumed as pilgrims. The whole is effective.Assume that two men may look so much alike that the mother of one of them believes the other to be her son","excerpt":"assume further that, although one is an English Earl and the other an American named Jones, any differences they may have in speech and penmanship pass unnoticed by all with whom they come into contact: assume, also, that the American may be thrown into the shoes of the Englishman without knowing the slightest thing about his life and history, and then, when all these and other assumptions have been made, you are prepared to see the pictured story of \\"The Man Who Lost Himself,\\" which is at the Strand this week. Any one disposed to make the necessary assumptions may, and undoubtedly will, enjoy the photoplay, for the two leading rôles are played by William Faversham with unfailing pantomimic ability and sureness of characterization. Also, Mr. Faversham, whose rôle in \\"The Silver King,\\" his previous picture, was entirely serious, reveals a distinctive talent for screen comedy in his present performance. His supporting cast is competent, especially Hedda Hopper, and Clarence G. Badger, who directed the production, has done, on the whole, a creditable piece of work. The picture is based on a story by H. de Vere Stacpole.\\"Dollars and Sense,\\" with Madge Kennedy, was announced as among the offerings at the Strand this week, but it is not among those present, having apparently been withdrawn at the last minute. The program includes, however, one of Max Fleisher's unique \\"Out of the Inkwell\\" cartoons and \\"A Gold Star Pilgrimage,\\" by Burton Holmes, shown at the request of the Committee for Devastated France.Other new pictures this week are \\"The Wonder Man,\\" with Georges Carpentier, running under the auspices of the American Legion at the Hotel Astor, \\"Thou Art the Man,\\" with Robert Warwick, at the Rialto; \\"The Courage of Marge O'Doone,\\" with Pauline Starke, at the Capitol for three days; \\"The Return of Tarzan,\\" at the Broadway, and \\"Some Wild Oats,\\" a picture for adults dealing with social hygiene, at the Harris Theatre. \\"Why Change Your Wife?\\" has moved from the Criterion to the Rivoli.

Lower priced than its parent, Anne Klein II had not had a show in a year and a half because it was changing its image, making clothing that was \\"a little younger and had a more hip attitude,\\" said Maurice Antaya, who has been in charge of design since the company started. After three years, Mr. Antaya was joined in his design duties by Richard Assatly. At the end of the show last month, the two men took their bows with their five assistants and walked down the runway to the applause of store buyers. A Hint of Grunge    The clothes were a little sharper and a little livelier than they had been. There were echoes of grunge, the rock-inspired style that captivated some audiences at the spring fashion shows in November. But these grunge elements were grace notes, like the stocking caps many models wore with their well-tailored suits, or the high-laced shoes that met the hems of longer skirts.

For several years the pianist and singer Daryl Scherman has been developing an enviable polish as a performer with a repertory of rarely heard songs, chosen perceptively from the pop output of the last 70 years. She has done this in solo situations, in a duo with the bassist Boots Maleson and in a trio with the guitarist James Chirillo. This weekend her group has become a quartet with the addition of the saxophonist Morris Goldberg, a white native of South Africa who came to the United States 30 years ago and has spent much of his career here playing with black South Africans like Hugh Masakela and Abdullah Ibrahim as well as with American musicians. The result is an unusual mixture of sources and styles. The group plays tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, 10:30 and 12:30, and on Sunday at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M. There is a music charge of $15 tonight and tomorrow, but no minimum at any show. In Great Footsteps     Ruth Brown, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, near 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7900. As great singers like Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington have passed from the music scene, one of the singers following most capably in their tradition is Ruth Brown. She might have been just a rhythm-and-blues belter, which was the way she started out in the 1950's, but she added to this the jazz inspiration she received from Holiday, Vaughan and Washington. In fact, her program at Fat Tuesday's includes many jazz standards, which she will record for an album when her engagement ends. Backed by a group led by the guitarist Rodney Jones, she will sing tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a $27.50 music charge and a $10 minimum. Cabaret and Jazz     Wendy Caplan and Billy Porter, J's, 2581 Broadway, north of 97th Street, (212) 666-3600.

She is a blonde named Melina Mercouri—and, boy, does she twinkle furiously!As a dynamic night-club entertainer in this ardent and tragic tale, which was shot in the streets and parks of Athens, a la an Italian neorealist film, she throws herself into her characterization with such extraordinary zip and verve that you worry sometimes for her blood pressure—especially since she is not a noticeably youthful girl.Her job is to give the impression of being a lusty dame who is hotly pursued by panting suitors, all clamoring to make her their wife. But while she accepts them as lovers—a sad young gentleman and a soccer player are the two we see—she insists upon maintaining her independence. She's just a girl who can't say \\"yes.\\"The situation is slightly Sapphic, and Miss Mercouri takes it in a stride that marks her a likely descendant of the sires of the Olympic games. She leaps into singing and dancing as though she was off for a 440-yard dash","excerpt":"at a football game, cheering her hero, she almost cripples herself jumping up and down. And when she kisses a fellow, it resembles a Greek wrestling match. Miss Mercouri is hot-cha all over, even when gurgling her last with a knife in her back.But somehow the screen play concocted by Michael Cacoyannis does not have quite the same surge of animation as the wildly enthusiastic star. It sets a grimly lugubrious drama, somewhat on the order of those we used to see on the silent screen, wherein the inevitable climax was the violent murder of the femme fatale. And the only thing that saves it—for a sophisticated audience, that is—is the unconscious spots of humor that brighten its dark solemnity.The flamboyance of Miss Mercouri, for instance, is often ludicrous, and Georges Foundas as the passionate soccer player is funny, unintentionally, most of the time. He has such an air of desperation and such a quaintly unlovely face, which is generally dripping perspiration. He must lose several pounds in each love scene.Likewise, Aleko Alexandrakis is grave to the point of caricature as the cast-off lover who gets smacked by an automobile, and most of the people around the heroine's night club are humorously agonized, too. The direction of Mr. Cacoyannis is generally stilted and naïve. In Greece, it may seem naturalistic, but it looks slightly antique over here.However, we must say Miss Mercouri is a robust and athletic girl who looks good and works like a demon. She keeps the party from being completely dull.And there's some lively bouzoukia playing in it (a bouzoukia is a kind of long-necked mandolin)—for those that like bouzoukia playing, that is.There are English subtitles to translate the spoken Greek.
