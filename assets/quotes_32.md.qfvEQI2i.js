B1    Holes in Security Net  In the years since the 9/11 attacks, concern about a potential terrorist strike at one of the nation's chemical plants has led to tighter safeguards.

By Freeman Wills Crofts. 300 pp. Nev York: Dodd, Mead & Oo. $2."},{"year":"1930","title":"Although the reproduction of voices and, for the most part, the acting, in \\"Guilty,\\" the Columbia picture now at the Cameo, deserve commendation, the dialogue and the manner in which the story is unfolded are disappointing. A year ago this talking film might have elicited no little praise, but due to the great improvement in the technical end of such production, more and more is demanded of the narrative.Circumstantial evidence is the theme of this pictorial offering. The players' lines and the coincidences give to it the aspect of an old-fashioned melodrama. It is based on a story called \\"Black Sheep\\" and was directed by George B. Seitz. The principals include Virginia Valli, John Holland and John St. Polis, who do what is asked of them in a creditable fashion. There is, however, little or no imagination in the filming of the various incidents and when poison is mentioned, one is assured that something tragic is contemplated.Only a few hours after Daniel Polk is released from a ten-years term in prison, for bribery, his daughter Carolyn announces to him her engagement to Robert Lee, the son of the prosecutor who was mainly responsible for Polk's, incarceration. On the same evening Robert Lee tells his father that he intends to wed Carolyn Polk and Mr. Lee Sr. is, of course, bitterly opposed to the union, as is also Polk.On his way from the prison, in the train, Mr. Polk refers to the honeysuckle outside the old homestead, which thought itself appears to be somewhat forced in the circumstances. Then Carolyn is anxious about the honeysuckle, \\"for her father's sake,\\" and Robert says that he will bring over a chemical that will revive the plants. He adds that it is poison. Sometime afterward Polk dies of poison and Robert is convicted of his murder. But, in such a picture, every one knows that the hero is not going to be permitted to stay in jail, and a most obvious way is discovered of proving Robert Lee's innocence.The opening scenes of this picture are promising, chiefly because the background is that of a hotel by the sea. But so soon as Carolyn becomes the subject of gossip, as the daughter of a convict, the dialogue is more than slightly tedious. The meeting of the two fathers is directed as though they were pawns in the director's hands. They become angry at the right time, stand aside for each other to unbosom their speeches and while old Lee's chauffeur is peering in through the window Polk is about to strike at Lee with something heavy, but is stopped from doing so by the sudden entrance of Robert Lee.The initial idea in this production, that of the sins of the fathers causing their children to be outcasts, was filmed so much more effectively in a recent Russian film. The forcing of the prosecutor's son to be a victim of circumstantial evidence, as was Polk, becomes a burden to the narrative rather than a help.Miss Valli is at her ease as Carolyn. John Holland's portrayal of Robert Lee is not without a certain merit. John St. Polis as Daniel Polk at times holds his own against extravagant situations.On the same program is \\"The Feline Fighter,\\" a Grantland Rice feature. It is very interesting, especially when a wildcat is cornered by the hounds and killed. It shows in a flash the difference in courage between one dog and another.

So far those two factors - processing speed and memory size - have distinguished the powers of giant mainframe and minicomputer systems from the personal computers that have taken over the nation's desktops. Now the differences are fading quickly. A new generation of microprocessors, the thinking part of a personal computer, has begun to appear on the market with powers that rival those of much larger machines.
