Nixon's war differs from Pres Johnson's war in major respects; Johnson and his sr advisers, in their phrase, 'dribbled out' targets chosen at their luncheon meetings; in current war, as before, there are restricted zones at Hanoi and Haiphong as well as a so‐called buffer zone along the China border about 25 mi deep; however, mil comdrs are free to strike designated mil targets in restricted and buffer zones whenever they feel the need to do so and are permitted to restrike these targets to maintain their destruction; most sr mil leaders are optimistic, but some of those interviewed are uncertain whether US air power can reduce flow of supplies overland from China to the point where Hanoi can no longer effectively prosecute the war in the South; goal of this air war is to deny N Vietnam any sea‐borne goods essential to its long‐term war effort; bombing in S Vietnam is on a par with the previous peak in '68; US Defense Dept silent on inquiries on civilian casualties;
