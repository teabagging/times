But slowly, like spring's reawakening, the young man whose doctors expected him to die began to emerge from his deep coma. He twitched when pinched. Then, like a baby, he would squeeze a finger put in his hand. His eyes, unfocused and glassy, began opening to slits. More than two weeks after a barrage of gunfire on March 1 bloodied a van full of Lubavitch Hasidic students on the Brooklyn Bridge, killing one, there was strong promise for Mr. Sasonkin, the most severely injured of the three wounded survivors. Bedside Readings    For someone like Mr. Sasonkin though, who had spent his days studying in the service of God and the Lubavitcher Grand Rabbi, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, mere survival was but one hurdle. So less than three weeks after the shooting, one of many relatives who kept a near-constant bedside vigil tested the 18-year-old yeshiva student, asking him which volume of the rabbi's writings had recently been published.

E. H. Griffith, the director, often uses his camera to advantage, but there are discursive passages that become somewat tedious, and so does the constant embracing of the husband and wife.Miss Harding has a most interesting personality on the screen. She is never twice exactly the same. Her acting is obviously the result of careful thought, which is especially noticeable when she talks over a telephone. Her actions and the cutting off of parts of words are very natural. In the dialogue, however, her utterance is not always distinct, for she slurs her lines, which is not so much a fault as it might seem, for her speech has a natural quality. It is in fact a joyous relief to study the work of an actress in a motion picture who is so modulated in her talking and whose performance throughout is so different from other players.Mr. Griffith opens his production with a far too lengthy sequence devoted to the wedding ceremony of Jim and Mary Hutton. Most of the marriage service is set forth in this episode, whereas a glimpse of the interior of the church with the chief participants and the words \\"to have and to hold\\" would have been more effective.Mr. Griffith achieves some splendid cinematic turns and twists when he reveals what is going on in the mind of Richard Parrish as he sits at the piano. It is an expert series of photographic flashes with multiple exposures in which a nebulous conception of Mary Hutton often looms large. It is a melange of music and romance and judging by what happens soon afterward the love with which Parrish is attacked dominates his art.Here, there is a flash of the South of France, where Jim Hutton is impelled to go and where he encounters the woman, who on his wedding day had told him that she was still infatuated with him. There are also scenes depicting the journeying Jim taking one or two of his several transatlantic voyages.The advice of Jim's father in the pictture is brief, but it has the same tenor as that of the play. The decision of the young couple immediately after leaving the altar not to permit anything to interfere with the spirituality of marriage is stressed gently but firmly, so that Mr. Barry's theme survives.Frederic March's interpretation of Jim Hutton is sympathetic and human. Leslie Fenton also gives a comprehensive characterization of the musician. Ilka Chase figures as a Fanny Shipman who rather races through her lines.\\"Painted Melodies,\\" with Abe Lyman and his \\"Californians,\\" is the stage attraction, in which are also seen Harry Savoy, Irene Taylor, Harry and Grace Masters and others.

This process has now reached some sort of climax with the publication a few months ago of Nabokov's latest novel &#8220;Look at the Harlequins!&#8221; and the republication in this collection of one of his earliest tales, &#8220;A Matter of Chance,&#8221; now first appearing in English 51 years after was published in the Riga Segodnya on June 22, 1924.

As John Wranovics recounts in ''Chaplin and Agee: The Untold Story of the Tramp, the Writer and the Lost Screenplay'' (Palgrave/Macmillan), Agee channeled those feelings into a quixotic project: a script for his idol, Charlie Chaplin. In Agee's 79-page treatment, Chaplin's Little Tramp alter ego survives a nuclear holocaust only to find himself in the grip of crypto-fascist technocrats determined to create a world ruled by science.    ''The Tramp's New World,'' as Mr. Wranovics calls it, was sent to Chaplin, who passed. Over the years, Agee's script was more rumor than fact, until Mr. Wranovics unearthed an incomplete, hand-written copy of the treatment at the University of Texas, where Agee's archives are kept. ''I was doing my honors thesis on the posthumous editing of 'A Death in the Family' at Berkeley when I came across a footnote referring to the script,'' said Mr. Wranovics, a marketing executive with a high-tech firm in Northern California. That was 20 years ago. Mr. Wranovics wanted to publish the treatment then, but the Agee estate said no, fearing harm to Agee's literary reputation. Flash forward to 2001, when Paul Sprecher, Agee's executor, came across Mr. Wranovics's original request and gave him the green light. Further digging turned up a complete typed manuscript","excerpt":"Agee's treatment has now been published for the first time as part of Mr. Wranovics's book.

Miss Dearie, who is somewhere in her 60's, exudes the vitality and mischievous spirit of an ageless flapper. Her singing, in a light, almost wispy voice, is also ageless, at once girlish and grandmotherly.    The essence of Miss Dearie's artistry lies in her impeccable sense of balance. The whispery texture of a voice that can seem about to disappear like a feather in the wind is countered by a rugged sense of swing that gives everything she does a solid jazz foundation. It is augmented by lilting pianism that at moments becomes almost chunky in its richness. Just as her voice seems about to evaporate into a vapor trail at the end of the phrase, she spins out a long final note in a delicately shaded vibrato. Maintaining perfect enunciation, Miss Dearie also never loses her storytelling sense.
