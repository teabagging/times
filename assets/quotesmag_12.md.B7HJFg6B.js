My own visit to Yugoslavia led me to much the same conclusion that Jeri Laber and Kenneth Anderson reach, namely that (1) United States aid to Yugoslavia should be tied to human rights and democracy, and (2) that aid should be targeted to those republics on the road to democracy and not directed to or through the weak federal government.   Last summer I led a seven-member Senate delegation to Yugoslavia. We were encouraged by progress toward democracy in parts of Yugoslavia, but deeply disturbed by the repression we saw in Kosovo. The Senate version of next year's foreign operations appropriations bill included language, offered by Senator Don Nickles on my behalf, targeting aid to those republics that have held free and fair elections, and that are not engaged in the abuse of human rights. Moreover, it required that the United States vote against multilateral assistance for projects in any republic that did not meet the same requirements for direct aid.   Unfortunately, we ran into obstacles in conference with the House. The State Department communicated its strong opposition to the measure and urged its rejection. Nevertheless, the Senate prevailed on compromise language that conditions aid to Yugoslavia, as a whole, on free and fair elections in all republics and substantial improvements in human rights.

It is populated by moody, pensive people capable of sudden intimacies that spring up under unexpected circumstances -- encounters over the telephone or on a subway car, glances through a window or across a cafe. Mr. Voulgaris's genteelly solemn film observes three isolated individuals -- a banker, a widow and a retired seaman -- and records the chance events that make them marginally less lonely, if only for a while.   Most of the major events in \\"Quiet Days in August\\" have the impact of a cake exchanged between neighbors, or a shy, amorous glance. Though the film is directed with taste and intelligence, its sensitivities are mostly too aching and muted to have much effect. Only in its later stages does the story become relatively eventful, and at that point it begins to feel forced. The main satisfaction in watching Mr. Voulgaris's understated film comes from the gentle elegance of his actors and the modest accuracy of his observations.

Sunni participation is critical to the election and while a boycott is far from certain, American officials fear the election will be regarded as illegitimate if there is one.   A1    Two suicide car bombs exploded within 15 minutes of each other in eastern Baghdad, killing at least 10 Iraqis and one American soldier, Iraqi and American officials said. The first bomb exploded next to an American military convoy, military officials said, and the second near a police academy.   A10    Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld paid an unannounced visit to Iraq, greeting troops, conferring with commanders and mapping out strategy with Iraqi leaders in an effort to ensure that elections can be held.   A11    Dissent Eases on Afghan Vote  The quest by opposition candidates to have Afghanistan's first presidential election nullified appeared to fade on Sunday, as some candidates moderated their stance in light of a consensus proclaiming the election, while not problem-free, a success because of the high turnout and low level of violence. Officials expect a final result to take two or three weeks.   A3    3 Die at Hands of Bomber  A suicide bomber blew himself up at a Shiite mosque in Lahore, Pakistan, killing himself and three other people and wounding at least eight, Pakistani officials said. The suicide attack comes just a day after unidentified gunmen killed a leading pro-Taliban Sunni cleric and his aide in Karachi. The killing had raised fears of reprisal attacks among the minority Shiites.   A3    First Clue in Egyptian Bombing  Investigators disclosed their first lead into the triple suicide bombing on the Sinai Peninsula with the confession from a Bedouin tribesman that he recently sold a large quantity of explosives to a young Egyptian man. The authorities now have a physical description of the man, said an Egyptian officer.   A8    Taiwan Leader Calls for Talks  President Chen Shui-bian called for opening peace talks with mainland China, in a conciliatory overture following President Hu Jintao's consolidation of power last month in Beijing. He also called for an emphasis on arms control.   A5    More U.S. Troops in Colombia  The number of American military personnel in Colombia will double, to 800, in the coming months, based on a weekend vote in the United States Congress. The action was welcomed by President √Ålvaro Uribe's government for its fight against Marxist rebels but condemned by human rights monitors, who warned of a sharp escalation in Colombia's conflict.   A5    NATIONAL   A12-21    High Voter Registration For Coveted Demographic  African-Americans, for four decades the most reliable reservoir of Democratic support in presidential elections, now are also part of a torrent of new voter registrations in swing states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio.   A1    Medicare Hitting Snags  The overhaul of the Medicare program by the Bush administration was seen as its biggest accomplishment in domestic policy and a major asset to the president's re-election campaign. But over the last 10 months, the administration's efforts to carry out the first phase of that law, providing drug discount cards to the elderly, have been plagued with difficulties.   A1    Prosecutor in the Spotlight  Ronnie Earle, who has been the prosecutor in Travis County, Tex., since Jimmy Carter won the White House, is in the spotlight as he pursues a case with ties to one of the most powerful Republicans in the country, Representative Tom DeLay, whose ethical problems in Washington could help Democratic candidates for the House.   A14    National Issues in Swing State  Local and regional issues usually dominate Wisconsin politics, but a sharp debate over the war in Iraq and domestic security is shaping the Senate race in the state this year. The debate on the two issues is at least as sharp as in the presidential race, where Wisconsin is considered a swing state.   A16    Edwards Makes the TV Rounds  John Edwards appeared on five Sunday morning talk shows, keeping the Democratic campaign in the public eye as John Kerry limits his campaigning in the next few days to prepare for the third and final presidential debate, in Tempe, Ariz.   A17    Up to 62 television stations owned or managed by the Sinclair Broadcasting Group -- many of them in crucial swing states -- will show a documentary highly critical of Senator John Kerry's antiwar activities 30 years ago within the next two weeks, Sinclair officials said.   A19    Rules for Driver's Licenses  The House and Senate, following a recommendation of the 9/11 commission, are moving toward setting rules for the states that would standardize the documentation required to obtain a driver's license, and the data the license would have to include.   A21    Mourning for Bus Crash Victims  Grief overwhelmed services at a church on Chicago's South Side as a community in mourning prayed for the victims of a casino tour bus crash that killed 14 travelers and injured 16 others in Arkansas.

Most of the problems have to do with lax maintenance, but federal officials say it is critical that they be fixed because they could lead to more serious safety issues if ignored.   A1    Deported for Minor Crimes  Andre Venant, a legal permanent resident of the United States, is facing deportation to his native Madagascar after being convicted of three minor subway card offenses in New York. His case illustrates a renewed enforcement of 1996 immigration restrictions.   B1    Sox Versus Stripes, Again  The New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox are squaring off for the American League championship for the second year in a row, and fans in both cities are dusting off the old totems and clich√©s of the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry.   B1    SPORTSMONDAY   D1-9    National League Playoffs  St. Louis advanced to the National League Championship Series by defeating the Dodgers, 6-2, at Dodger Stadium, to capture the best-of-five-game series, 3-1. In the other division series, the Atlanta Braves' J.D. Drew singled in Rafael Furcal in the top of the ninth and reliever John Smoltz survived two harrowing innings as the Braves defeated the Houston Astros, 6-5, in Minute Maid Park to even their series at two games apiece.   D1    Deaths at Pitcher's House  Yankee pitcher Mariano Rivera traveled from New York to his home in Puerto Caimito, Panama, yesterday morning after two of his wife's relatives died in an electrical accident there on Saturday.   A1    ARTS   E1-10    Orchestra Reaches Agreement  The musicians and management of the New York Philharmonic have agreed to a new labor contract on the eve of an 18-day tour in Asia. The contract raises salaries at six-month intervals so that by the end of the three-year agreement, in 2007, the Philharmonic's minimum wage, now $103,000, will rise to $113,360.   E1    BUSINESS DAY   C1-12    Cell Phones and Older Users  The mobile phone industry is turning its attention to the last untapped demographic -- people over 65. But AARP, the exceedingly powerful lobby and advocacy group for older Americans, is not happy with what it has heard from its members.   A1    Corporate Tax Bill Delayed  The Senate cleared a path for a bill to hand out about $140 billion in corporate tax breaks, but it was blocked from a final vote by a fight over a provision aimed at helping reserve soldiers on active duty in Iraq.

Boston's Jamaica Plain has long been considered a model for a workable neighborhood with a strong sense of community. Racially and socioeconomically diverse, J.P. -- as it is known throughout the city -- boasts an eclectic mix of residents and business people who have dedicated themselves to keeping the area vibrant and viable. In ''A Home in the Heart of the City,'' Kathleen Hirsch has written a heartfelt profile of this working-class enclave. She chronicles the devotion of the people who put themselves on the line to maintain municipal services, develop new programs, reach the disenfranchised and make Jamaica Plain an attractive place to live. (For some reason, according to Hirsch, these citizens work tirelessly for the community but throw up their hands when it comes to the public schools, which she describes disparagingly.) Many of the individual tales Hirsch relates about Jamaica Plainers are engaging","excerpt":"unfortunately, however, the writing is facile and formulaic. Too many of the ''heroes'' of J.P. have become committed and empowered and have ''never looked back.'' A transformation occurs, making aspects of the community ''magical,'' providing ''attachment'' and ''tranquillity,'' and able to provide establishments that ''welcome all who come through its doors.''

Stumm is an expert on the hydrology and geology of the New York metropolitan area.    Writing in Invisible Ink    The Times: We're delighted that you could attend today and help us embark on a project well outside our usual business. Our time capsule began merely as an editorial conceit, but eventually we came to think that it would be more interesting if we actually built one, to be opened in the year 3000. We're not that interested in a conventional time capsule. A box full of stuff buried in a hole seems old-fashioned. We're leaning instead toward some sort of digital capsule. What do you think?    Margaret Maclean: Digital is a problem. Digital storage media -- floppies, compact discs, whatever -- don't have a long life span. A few decades at most. Analog is the way you should go.     The Times: What's analog? How exactly does that differ from digital?    Gregory Benford: Digital information is stored as zeroes and ones -- you need a computer to read it, whether it's on a compact disc, a computer file or a digital videotape. So-called analog information, on the other hand, is a direct representation of information: a photographic print, the sound grooves on an LP, the frames of a movie.    Maclean: Digital storage is an all-or-nothing proposition. Once the zeroes and ones that make up the digital record start to break down, the entire disk or tape becomes unreadable. Analog is different. When an old photo deteriorates, you can still see some of it. But when a digital image deteriorates, you lose the whole ball of wax. One more thing -- reading a digital record requires electronic translation of the zeroes and ones into text or pictures or sound. If you don't have the right hardware or software, you're out of luck. This happens now after a couple of years. Some of NASA's early images of the earth are no longer readable. We've been using the equipment in a state of faith, not fact. In 1,000 years, who will understand such strange, ephemeral technology? It's already hard enough to find a disk drive for 5 1/2-inch floppies.    Dianne Van Der Reyden: Right now, your only option is to ''migrate'' the digital data -- keep copying it over into the latest format. But that's a lot of work. Besides, the whole point of a time capsule is that people aren't supposed to be able to see what's in there. That's the difference between a time capsule and a library.    The Times: So for our purpose, analog is better than digital?    Maclean: A million times better. Keep in mind, however, that both are fragile. The musician Brian Eno tells a story about storing his music on a kind of analog recording tape that was a big deal about 15 years ago. One day, while listening to some of these tapes, he happened to walk around to the side of the player. He noticed that the oxide on the tape was falling off into little piles of dust. He stopped the reels, realizing that he could play his tapes only once.     The Times: But if we can't use a CD, and we can't use a tape, how do we preserve sound recordings?    Mary Turner Baker: Put it on a record, but not a vinyl record -- it won't last. Instead, enclose the metal master used to stamp out the vinyl copies.    Maclean: There's another long-term analog storage medium that you could consider. We were looking for ways to preserve text that avoid the problems of digital technology. We found this company called Norsam Technologies, which makes HD-Rosetta disks, metal plates that are inscribed with microscopic text and images. You can put up to a thousand pages on one disk and still read it with a high-school chemistry lab microscope. It's an analog format, like microfilm.    Van Der Reyden: While we're talking about ways to preserve words and images, don't forget about paper. Some papers have lasted for more than a thousand years. Under the right conditions, acid-free paper can last for a long time.    The Times: Records rather than CD's. Acid-free paper and HD-Rosetta disks instead of computer files. What about photos?     Van Der Reyden: Photos have to be printed on good quality paper. Black-and-white silver-gelatin photographs last longer than color photographs. If they're kept in stable conditions -- no direct sunlight, stable temperatures, no moisture -- there's a good chance most photos will be fine. Keep in mind, however, that we don't know for sure how long they will last. We can only do accelerated-aging tests.    The Times: What about organic materials: seeds, for example, or a lock of hair? Would the hair contain DNA that could be read in the year 3000?    Van Der Reyden: Yes, so long as you got the hair follicle as well. You should put them into little glass vials. You could also put seeds in vials, or any other kind of organic material.    The Times: What kind of container do we use for all this stuff? Should we build the capsule out of plastic or metal? Or something else?    Ronald Garner: You could use polyethylene. It's a plastic with a very high carbon content, which makes it almost impervious to sunlight. And you can seal the seams with nothing more than heat. They've done some accelerated-aging tests on it","excerpt":"unfortunately, the best data I can find doesn't go beyond 75 years. You could also use stainless steel. It takes a long time to corrode and is extremely durable. In the United States, we use it to store plutonium.    The Times: How can we make sure that everything remains stable in our box?    Baker: You might consider pumping it full of nitrogen or an inert gas like argon. And you should group materials by classes, with a separate compartment for each. Similar kinds of papers in one, plastics in another, other substances in a third.    A Sacred Place or a Priesthood?    The Times: Where do we put this thing once we've packed it? And how do we make certain that people will open it in a thousand years?    Benford: That depends which strategy you choose. Do you hide it and hope someone finds it? Or do you leave behind a marking system? If you bury it, you should create a pattern of iron magnets around the capsule. That will suggest some kind of purpose to anyone who stumbles upon it.    Maclean: But who's going to know that this is a time capsule that's meant to be opened by people in the year 3000?     Frederick Stumm: That's a problem. You need to convey the message that people in the future have to wait until 3000. But people in the future might not understand.    The Times: You don't think they are going to be able to read English? We can understand texts that were written in the year 1000.    Benford: Try reading ''Beowulf'' now. The guy who digs this up may not be a classical scholar.     Baker: For all we know, people in the year 3000 may be primitive and ignorant and destructive. The capsule may be opened in a dark age when people don't understand or are afraid of information.     The Times: That problem aside, how do we make sure the capsule doesn't end up lost?    Benford: That's difficult. Imagine 1,000 years from now: the United States doesn't exist and there's debris all over. Every goddamn President and major literary figure and editor of The New York Times has got a monument somewhere. It's going to be difficult to find a capsule buried amid all that clutter.    Stumm: Also, let's say you leave behind a record of its exact latitude and longitude. That will shift over the next thousand years, thanks to changes in the earth's axis and continental drift. As the plates in the earth's crust move apart, Europe and America will drift away from each other. By the year 3000, the coordinates of the capsule will have shifted by as much as 60 feet. You'd have to project what the future coordinates would be.    The Times: Let's talk a bit more about where we're going to put the capsule. Is the water table a problem if we bury it a few feet underground or put it in an abandoned tunnel?    Stumm: There are significant fractures beneath the island of Manhattan. It's therefore difficult to know the elevation of groundwater in any given place. At the present time, we have to pump groundwater out of some of the subway stations. In a couple hundred years, an abandoned tunnel may fill up with water and destroy the capsule's contents.    The Times: What's the future of the water table here in Manhattan?    Stumm: Well, today, near Central Park, the water table is about 43 feet above sea level. It's estimated that the sea level will rise about eight feet over the next thousand years. The consequent change in the water table may saturate fractures in the bedrock and flood your capsule if you fail to bury it in rock that is above the future water table. I would instead suggest that you bury it above that -- that is, drill sideways into an outcrop of bedrock in Central Park. That would insulate the capsule and keep it relatively dry into the future.     Benford: I'd also recommend Central Park, or some other sacred ground like the Revolutionary War-era graveyard near the World Trade Center, which has remained largely undisturbed for centuries. You should place your bets on the few spots that have been relatively untouched, the ones that are time-honored. On the other hand, if you put it in your own basement at The Times, you'd save money.    Maclean: Your building may look permanent to you, but I can tell you from experience, architecture doesn't last that long. And how can you control the ownership of the building?    Stumm: Keep in mind, too, that at least four earthquakes have hit this area since 1500. Two of them were substantial enough to damage some buildings. The likelihood of an earthquake should be factored into the capsule's design and location.    Maclean: If you handed over stewardship to an institution that would persevere for a thousand years, then you wouldn't have to worry as much about earthquakes and changes in the sea level. A stable institution like a synagogue or a museum would protect it and move it when they go.    Benford: What you really need is a ''priesthood'' -- people who will worship and take care of the capsule.     The Times: So find some institution to act as a priesthood and hitch a ride with them?    Maclean: You can count on cultural institutions to be conservative and last the longest. Think of weddings and funerals. Traditional events like these connect generations. Cultural institutions play a similar role in preserving memory.     Benford: If we're trying to command the respect and care of a priesthood, beauty has been one device for achieving that. Take illuminated manuscripts, for example. Something like the Book of Kells.     But let me caution against making it out of something valuable, like gold. You need to protect it against your typical grave robber. Your toughest problem is attracting attention without making it seem that there's something worth stealing. You make it pretty, somebody will steal it. But at the same time, you've got to make it worthy of preservation. Face it: these are two contradictory objectives. There is a spectrum of choices. In the end, you have to make one, almost on faith. But in this climate, I wouldn't count on anything lasting if you just leave it to nature. Sometimes, beauty is the best defense.   Built to Last"},{"year":"1982","title":"Q. What causes cluster headaches?   A. Researchers have not been able to determine the cause of cluster headaches, which typically occur at night, two or three hours after falling asleep, and are usually limited to one or the other eye. The headaches characteristically come night after night for a period of up to three months, followed by a headache-free period that can last for years. Some researchers consider cluster headaches a special case of migraine headache","excerpt":"unfortunately, the cause of migraines is also unknown. One interesting hypothesis, being investigated by Dr.  David R. Coddon and colleagues at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, is that the body's immune system is involved, possibly under the stimulation of a virus infection. During the headache, the eye usually sheds tears and there is a nasal discharge on the affected side, just as in a head cold. Experiments are under way in which serum drawn from the patient during a headache-free period can be stored and used during a new attack to immunize the patient against the headache. Q&A"},{"year":"1993","title":"\\"I felt as if a scream was going through nature -- I thought I heard a scream,\\" the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch wrote in his diary one evening, after watching the sun set blood-red across an Oslo fjord. He translated that impression into one of the most powerful images of head-spinning anxiety ever created, \\"The Scream\\" (1893). Munch (1863-1944), who lived by what he once described as a gospel of pain, expressed the anguish of broken relations, death and illness, isolation and despair in a continuing project, \\"The Frieze of Life.\\" This thematic series of paintings, which includes such famous works as \\"The Dance of Life\\" (1900) as well as \\"The Scream,\\" was first exhibited in 1902 and again, with new pictures, in 1913 and 1918. All 85 paintings are reproduced in EDVARD MUNCH: The Frieze of Life (National Gallery Publications/Abrams, $45)","excerpt":"unfortunately, the color is disappointingly muddy. Happily, however, four excellent essays examine aspects of Munch's tempestuous life and proto-Expressionist style. Reinhold Heller, a professor of art history at the University of Chicago, writes entertainingly of the bohemian cafe set in Oslo, where heady discussions of Nietzsche, free love and free thought inspired both Munch and Strindberg to test their limits in a debilitating cycle of drink and problematic affairs that often ended in abandonment, coercion and emotional abuse. Not surprisingly, Munch's women are often either Magdalenes or Madonnas -- lustful, ruined women or prepubescent innocents -- who entwine men in tangles of overpowering feeling. However, Munch's images do not add up to a pessimistic vision of blind despair. His subjects are often caught in a moment not just of pain but of awakening and awareness, as in \\"Desire\\" (1907), in which a woman looks up in horror as a man buries his face in her bosom. An element of mystery -- what unsettling truth has pressed its way into her mind? -- saves the image from hopeless melodrama. And that is a condition, this book makes plain, that Munch's work, and life, sailed dangerously near.

Her computer-literate 10-year-old daughter was pecking away on a Macintosh. I walked over to see what she was doing and there, beautifully centered in an outline type font, she had written:   I have nothing to do  I have nothing to do  I am board  Only fifteen minutes till lunch.                    . . .         A Lexington Avenue subway uptown train. A man enters and starts the all-too-familiar spiel. \\"Ladies and gentlemen,\\" he says. Most of the passengers look the other way as he continues. \\"Permit me to introduce myself. My name is Dennis. I am homeless. I live in Bloomingdale's.\\"   At this point the passengers look up. \\"Now that I have your attention . . . . \\" the fellow says.                    . . .         To be filed under T as in Tommy, or perhaps Telephone Conversation between a Manhattan man we know and his sister in California, as recounted by the man.   Her: So what terrific things have you been doing?   Him: I saw \\"Tommy\\" the other night.   Her: Who?   Him: Yeah, right.    Her: What do you mean, right?   Him: I saw the Who's \\"Tommy.\\" It's a hit musical.    Her: Oh.    The confusion went on a bit longer but enough is enough. At any rate, consider the conversation a shoo-in for this week's Who's on First award.                    . . .       Dear Diary:   Luci and I were ushered across Seventh Avenue in the 50's by the aggressive young men with the walkie-talkies. When we saw the lights, cameras and action among a horde of time-warped Afro-wigged people in 70's bell-bottoms and what appeared to be an electric truck, we had the usual questions ready. But we had been anticipated, as this sign posted on the truck proved:   1. IT'S A MOVIE.    2. \\"CARLITO'S WAY. \\"   3. AL PACINO.    4. PENELOPE MILLER.    5. BRIAN DEPALMA.    6. ELECTRIC TRUCK.    7. NOW!    8. THEY'RE EXTRAS. -- ROBERT SULLIVAN                    . . .       Dear Diary:   Playground season has arrived for us parents of small children, and with it skinned knees and banged heads. Though I don't find such injuries laughing matters, I recently observed a father with a curious method for dealing with kiddie boo-boos.   His two sons were running helter-skelter across a Bronx playground when the older boy (about 6) tripped and skidded on the asphalt, lightly cutting his lip. The child immediately set up a sustained wail not unlike an air-raid siren's. Dad, though, was unimpressed","excerpt":"unhurried and smiling, he picked up his son and, during careful blood-stanching and kiss-it-and-make-it-better concern, delivered the following monologue (or as close to it as I recall).   \\"We will now present the Academy Award for the best performance by an actor in the role of an Injured Child. The nominees are: Enrique Guzman for his performance of 'I Hurt Myself at the Playground and I Cut My Lip and I Think I'm Going to Die.' There are no other nominees. May I have the envelope, please? And the winner is: Enrique Guzman for 'I Hurt Myself at the Playground.' H'ray!\\"    Enrique is by now smiling wanly through his tears. Dad goes on in a mock-resonant tone: \\"Accepting the award for Mr. Guzman is ---- Enrique Guzman!\\"    The sniffling but fascinated child is deposited in his little brother's stroller and Dad switches to a breathless falsetto as they roll out the gate.    \\"I want to take this opportunity to thank my overindulgent parents. Without them, my performance would have been impossible. Thank you and God bless.\\" And they're gone. -- LUIS GAMEZ                    . . .         The scene is an East Loop bus, Long Beach, L.I.  A middle-age couple asks the driver to let them know when he reaches the 600 block on East Park Avenue. The driver asks them which number they want in order to let them off at the correct corner.   \\"661,\\" they reply.    \\"That's the deli,\\" a male passenger chimes in.   \\"Such a nice boy runs it,\\" a woman says.   \\"A wonderful boy,\\" adds another. \\"Is he your son?\\"   It must be the sea air.

For commuters, and perhaps for Mrs. Thatcher, too, one unmistakable sign of a return to ''normal'' has been the proliferation of work stoppages, notably separate strikes on British Rail and the Underground, the London subway.
