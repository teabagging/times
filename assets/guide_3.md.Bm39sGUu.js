The vehicle for this financial sleight-of-hand was an ''educational benefit trust'' set up by a four-doctor professional corporation to pay the future college expenses of its employees' children. It made annual contributions to the trust out of pretax profits and planned to disburse the funds to the colleges attended by the children. The trust was established at a local bank and an unrelated employee benefits consultant served as trustee. Every employee of the corporation - not just its physician shareholders - was eligible for tuition payments. They could receive up to $4,000 annually per child between the age of 18 and 29 who enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program at an accredited college or university. Each child qualified for up to four years of benefits and there were no restrictions on eligibility","excerpt":"benefits were payable without regard to grades or need.

Those who revel in jazz bands and in stories of hoofers who become separated from their fair partners through the financial machinations of smooth-voiced, good looking men-about-Park Avenue and Broadway, may find this a jovial, melodious production. Others who want something more subtle or polished will hardly enjoy the ramifications of the narrative, although they may be entertained by Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians.At one of the first showings of \\"Syncopation\\" last Saturday, the tonal quality of the introductory passages was not particularly clear, due, perhaps, to the failing of the sound devices, either in the projection booth or behind the screen.It is a tale of night club life, of Flo, wife and dancing partner of the redoubtable Benny. The dancing team is known as Sloane and Darrell. After hearing Benny's bromidic utterances and learning of his capacity for food, one is inclined to sympathize with Flo, when she flings down the gauntlet to Benny and breaks up the partnership. Money, however, possesses a meaning to Flo, even if it doesn't to Benny when he is alone. So, when Flo returns a few moments later and hears Benny declining an offer of several hundred dollars a week, she at once decides to resume work with her husband.Benny is the type of energetic fellow who resents affectation. Therefore, when Flo, who becomes Fleurette, and Benny, still as Benny, make a success as a night club dancing team, there is a great deal of bickering between them, not only regarding Benny's manners, but also because of his unimaginative taste in furnishings for their Long Island home!Winston, the scheming millionaire who has been footing the bill for the dancing team because he finds Fleurette a fascinating creature, naturally welcomes the disputes that arise between the girl and her partner. He is one of those thoughtful specimens who looks at a smooth pair of feminine hands and then declares that they are sadly in need of diamonds. Moreover, he never forgets to send orchids to Fleurette, who, as time goes on, finds it a pleasant relief to go to supper with a man of taste, such as Winston. But when the time comes to declare himself, or put his cards on the table, Winston falls from grace, for he frankly admits that while he would like to go to Paris with Fleurette, he is opposed to marriage, even if she obtained a divorce from her husband. And so poor, little Fleurette's eyes are opened to the wickedness of Mr. Winston, for, as she tells him, she is \\"not that kind of a girl.\\"When opportunity offers, Mr. Waring's Pennsylvanians entertain, on the screen, in the Night Club. Their \\"Tin Pan Parade\\" is a very successful number. Sloane and Darrell are also seen in their terpsichorean gyrations, which bring forth a tumult of applause from, the frequenters of the nocturnal resort.There is an element of comedy in some of the passages, in which Morton Downey and Verree Teasdale are seen. Miss Teasdale impersonates Rita, a girl who is none too bright, but who nevertheless succeeds in wringing a marriage proposal from Lew (Mr. Downey).Osgood Perkins acts the part of the vaudeville agent who is frequently a bearer of good news. Through this Mr. Hummel's telephone messages substantial salaries come to Benny and Fleurette and, at the end, he is chiefly responsible for Fleurette and Benny being paid still more money and, for all one knows, for their living as happily ever after as this couple could, considering what one knows about Benny.Barbara Bennett is quite attractive as Fleurette. Bobby Watson succeeds in making Benny an uninteresting rough diamond Ian Hunter, like other villains in musical comedies, almost wins one's favor, but his lines handicap him.Grantland Rice's \\"Sportlight\\" deals with several favorites in the sports world and during one sequence the late Tex Rickard is both heard and seen on the screen.

Hillerman orchestrates the chaos brilliantly in THE SINISTER PIG (HarperCollins, $25.95), devising a plot that draws all these interested parties to a lonely dirt road in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico (''the very heart of America's version of the Persian Gulf''), where an undercover agent has been murdered while investigating possible criminal sabotage of the oil pipelines. Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo police and his retired mentor, Joe Leaphorn, are quick to pick up on the implications for a federal inquiry into some $40 billion in oil revenues that never made it into the Tribal Trust Fund. But the F.B.I. elbows them off the case, and it is left to a rookie, Bernadette Manuelito, working Border Patrol near Mexico, to follow the cynical scheme to its bedrock, allowing Hillerman to tie all three investigative strands together in an extraordinary display of sheer plotting craftsmanship.      Depression is a state of being that has to be nurtured, and it's clear from THE DOGS OF RIGA (New Press, $24.95) that Inspector Kurt Wallander, the brooding hero of Henning Mankell's introspective police procedurals, has been working on his condition for at least a decade. ''The future of our society gets gloomier and gloomier,'' he reflects in this novel, which was originally published in 1992 in Sweden, ''a country that was changing rapidly, becoming unfamiliar and uncertain.'' Wallander's fatalistic mood intensifies when a life raft drifts ashore on a provincial town beach carrying two dead men from an Eastern bloc country, their bodies ''tortured pretty comprehensively,'' as Laurie Thompson's fastidious translation puts it. Certain now that he lacks the stomach for the escalating levels of violence in modern society, the despondent inspector has an anxiety attack that lands him in the hospital.
