Enter, also for the trip, a wagon train and Miss Malone, loved by Mr. Chandler and a hostile colleague, Mr. Andes (the lady's husband).That trip, a wild, milling and bloody affair, is graphically guided by director George Marshall, and leaves a handful of survivors. With both sides in accord, peace descends on the Oregon Trail, and that is that.However, the perfectly natural behavior of the entire cast and especially the incisive dialogue—these are something else again.

'BEND OF THE RIVER' AND 'THE FAR COUNTRY' -- (Universal, $14.98 each, released last week) Universal is finally digging into its vast library to release something other than horror movies and Abbott and Costello comedies. These two classic Anthony Mann-James Stewart films are part of a collection of 11 westerns coming out this month, aimed at the family market but of great interest to cinephiles as well. When Mann, the creator of some of the toughest postwar films noirs (''Raw Deal,''  ''T-Men''), teamed up with a Stewart whose aw-shucks personality was considerably darkened by his own wartime experiences, they brought a new edge of anger and anxiety to America's most essential genre.

Westover's magnificent main building happens to have been designed by Connecticut's first female architect, Theodate Pope Riddle. The idea, according to the designer, was to combine ''appropriateness with beauty.'' In this setting, an all-female cast performed. Macbeth's voice may have sounded a little high, but there was no skimping on theatrical enthusiasm and the production was probably a good example of how Westover, a traditional all-girls' school, grades 9 through 12, has adapted and modified its program for a more modern age.

So he ordered up a definitive study from the National Academy of Sciences.    That study, over two years in the making, is nearly complete.

Last week, the committee approved a bill that would weaken many of the basic protections provided by the Clean Water Act of 1972, recognized by experts in both parties as a major environmental success story. The bill includes the committee's own definition of what a wetland is -- a political contrivance so narrow that it would expose millions of acres to exploitation.
