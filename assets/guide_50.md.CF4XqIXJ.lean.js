Students might be asked to take three years of mathematics instead of two, two of a foreign language instead of one.   In New York City, where an \\"open admissions\\" college policy is virtually untouchable, the City University's board of trustees voted last week to toughen its admission standards, sort of. High school graduates who cannot meet the rigorous new standard of 16 year-long courses will still be permitted to enter C. U. N. Y., but they will have to spend part of their college career taking the missing material.   The plan drawn by Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds tightens graduation standards for the university's 200,000 students in phases through the year 2000. For most, it may mean a course or two more than they might have preferred to take. The move was choreographed with Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, who already boosted the mathematics requirement and plans upgradings in science and language. But Mr. Fernandez is facing a shortage of licensed teachers, and it is by no means clear that the financially pressed city will be able to supply them. April 26-May 2: Remediation","excerpt":"C. U.

Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president; Representative Anthony D. Weiner; and City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, as recorded by The New York Times.    (At one point, Ms. Fields was pressed for specifics on how she would pay for raises for police officers.)    FIELDS -- It is important that we increase the starting salary beyond $25,000 because we are not going to be able to recruit the caliber of people, and we understand that. And that is a negotiation process.    Q. So what do you do? How do you get the money?    FIELDS -- But you know, the question is often asked how do you get money --    Q. I mean these people are going to come into the academy now.    FIELDS -- -- and I just want to point out: Budgets reflect priorities of any mayor who sets them.    Q. Ms. Fields, where --    FIELDS -- And as a priority --    Q. -- where do you get the money for this?    FIELDS -- As a priority within the existing budget.    WEINER -- But where? Virginia, where do you get the money?    FIELDS -- Anthony, you get it out of the budget, that's where you get it from. We have a $50 billion budget.    WEINER -- But this is money you're adding to the budget. Where do you get the added money?    FIELDS -- You can reorder priorities within a budget.    WEINER -- This is what's wrong. O.K.    (At another point, Mr. Ferrer's plan for a stock transfer tax to improve the schools came under attack from Mr. Weiner.)    FERRER -- There are three crises facing this city: high dropout rate, affordability in housing, unconscionably high unemployment rate, especially among African-American and Latino males. And with all due respect, again, this isn't the time for baby steps. This is the time for bold solutions. We've got to put forward --    WEINER -- Not bold tax increases, Freddy.    FERRER -- -- we've got to put forward solutions that deal with these crises. And if you don't think that high dropout rate -- more than 50 percent -- brings this city down --    Q. Well, let's stay with this --    FERRER -- -- then we do have a difference of opinion.    Q. -- let's stay on this issue. Let's stay with this issue --    WEINER -- A big tax increase does not -- I don't consider a big tax increase to solve education, especially a stock-transfer tax from the 1970's isn't a bold idea, it is a bad idea. And that's what this debate should be about, not whether we solve problems --    FERRER -- Let's discuss that --    WEINER -- -- it's whether or not we do it --    FERRER -- -- let's discuss that.    WEINER -- -- in a smart way that makes our party the electable party for the generation moving forward.    FERRER -- -- because, Congressman, you keep on, time after time, confusing a mom-and-pop investor with the global investment community. But here's the question: Ask any one of those mom-and-pop investors, would you rather pay a half a penny a share --    WEINER -- But not people who work on Wall Street.    FERRER -- Excuse me a second. Excuse me a second, I didn't interrupt you, Anthony.    WEINER -- Oh, I'm sorry. You were the only one who hadn't interrupted today, you're right.    FERRER -- Thank you. Here's the question: Ask any one of them, would you rather pay a half a penny a share, a transaction, or would you rather pay thousands of dollars a year in tuition to a private school? I think I know the answer --    WEINER -- Freddy, you know who I agree with on this?    FERRER -- -- because I've asked them.    WEINER -- I agree with you, who said it wasn't the greatest idea in the world. I agree with your supporter, Eliot Spitzer, who reportedly said it was crazy. I agree with people who say that taxing --    FERRER -- You can't make things up, Anthony. Come on.    WEINER -- -- Wall Street is like someone in Wisconsin proposing a dairy tax.
