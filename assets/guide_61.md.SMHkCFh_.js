The project makes use of some of the best -- and most seasoned -- dancers in the country. And it has brought to new mass audiences at summer festival auditoriums around the nation choreography that makes no concession to those audiences.    Mr. Baryshnikov may be the big draw, as he clearly was in a White Oaks performance tonight at the Mann Music Center. But he was not performing the star vehicles one might expect on a summer tour. In fact, the five early and recent dances on the program had a style, wit and musicality that were wholly their own, neither mainstream nor self-consciously iconoclastic.
