says this acctg will be made public; GSA Admr A Sampson insists that almost no Fed funds have been spent that would be of lasting value to Nixon's property, news conf; GSA has previously said that it spent $703,000 on Nixon-owned property at San Clemente and $1,180,000 at Key Biscayne; Sampson now adds $1,741,000 spent on office complex on Coast Guard base adjacent to San Clemente home, $16,000 spent on Grand Cay, Bahamas island owned by R H Abplanalp where Nixon frequently goes, and about $50,000 to provide security for Nixon daughters; this raises GSA total to about $3.7-million; White House press sec Warren says about $300,000 of mil spending was for communications equipment that would help Nixon keep in touch with world affair; says about 2/3 of this will be recoverable; says about $160,000 in mil equipment was placed on Grand Cay and all this will be recovered; says that what he calls 'recurring costs,' mostly in communications, of about $330,000-a-yr will presumably not be recovered; Sampson says he cannot estimate how much of GSA expenditures can be recovered but says it is obvious that investment in buried cables and landscaping will not be recovered; Secret Service repr says that virtually all of its $300,000 expenditure was for reusable detection devices; Sampson estimates that just getting answers to questions about spending on Nixon's properties has cost GSA $100,000; says 1 of majo'r costs at San Clemente was for landscaping; insists that this was required by Secret Service need to have power lines and TV coaxial cables buried as part of its detection system and then property had to be restored to its original condition; 1 item that many reporters have asked GSA about is bullet-resistant glass screen erected on west side of swimming pool; pool was paid for by Nixon but screen was purchased by GSA; Sampson refers on Aug 6 to screen as 'wind screen' but when asked to discuss it further insists he never used words and that it was 'security screen'; tape recordings of news conf show he called it wind screen; screen cost about $10,000; Sampson defends spending $4,834.50 for furniture in Pres's study at San Clemente; says this is just another Pres office and so should be furnished at govt expense; inherent in all of Sampson's justifications for spending was basic argument that if Secret Service asked for something in name of Pres security, it was incumbent on GSA to provide it; Sampson says that at meeting of White House personnel, Secret Service and GSA reprs in spring of '69, it was decided that no information whatsoever would be given out because any revealed might endanger Pres's security;

After all, it's interfering with his class work at Columbia.    BULLETS OVER BROADWAY (1994)  Tuesday at 1:45 p.m. on Starz; Saturday at 8:30 a.m. on TMC.    John Cusack shines as the Woody Allen character in Mr. Allen's sparkly Prohibition-era theater farce about an insecure playwright doing a new production with big problems. Mr. Cusack manages to capture the insecurity and the lovability without doing an impersonation. Chazz Palminteri, who plays the bodyguard of the mobster's bimbo girlfriend, is the story's center. He turns out to be the most brilliant play doctor in town. Dianne Wiest (left, with Mr. Cusack) is the play's manipulative star, a grandstanding actress who arrives late for rehearsal and explains, ''My pedicurist had a stroke.'' Ms. Wiest won the best supporting actress Oscar.    LAURA (1944)  Saturday at 10 a.m. on Fox Movie Channel.    Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has everything: youth, beauty, a beautifully furnished apartment, a successful career in advertising, a suave fiancé (Vincent Price), a country place in Connecticut and those quirky Bonnie Cashin hats. So it's particularly sad when a police detective (Dana Andrews, center, with Tierney and Price) is called in to investigate her murder and falls in love with the portrait of her above the fireplace. Otto Preminger's haunting whodunit, full of surprises and flashbacks, has one more unforgettable character: Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a 50-cents-a-word writer (60 years ago) who enjoys working in the bathtub and tells Laura, ''I hope you'll never regret what promises to be a disgustingly earthy relationship.''    THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991)  Wednesday at 9 p.m. and Thursday at 4:30 p.m. on USA.    At some point, everybody has to work with someone unlikable, but Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), young F.B.I. agent, has a special challenge. To help catch a serial killer, she has to bond with Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins, left), a k a Hannibal the Cannibal, a man with a high I.Q., a hunger for human flesh and a knack for pushing her psychological buttons.

As a faculty member since 1956, Don not only could recall much of our school's history, he also was part of our history. His influence on the school and the entire ColumbiaPresbyterian complex is wide and deep. He generated considerable support for facilities, young researchers, and students. He was an honorary alumnus of P&S and as dean started a series of meetings with P&S alumni throughout the nation","excerpt":"annual giving from alumni doubled during that time. Among his important legacies is ''The Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons Complete Home Medical Guide'', first published in 1985.

In the course of his career as a member of the Faculty of Medicine, Dr. Tapley focused his research activities on the metabolic effects of thyroid hormone, and more specifically, on the action of the thyroid hormone thyroxine on mitochondria, for which he received worldwide scientific recognition. He served as Dean of Columbia's Medical School from 1974-1984. In 1984 he was named P & S Alumni Professor and Senior Deputy Vice President for Health Scienes. Dr. Tapley conceived The P & S Journal and served as its Editor for many years. Under his guidance it developed into a major means of communication between the medical school and its alumni and friends. His innovative leadership, wise counsel and dedicated service to P & S were a continuing source of pride to his colleagues in the Alumni Association.
