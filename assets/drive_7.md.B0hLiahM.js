Well, raising taxes and banning cigarette advertising are two options. But so far, at least, this nation has not moved strongly on either front. In Britain, the new Government said last week that it would ban all cigarette ads and bar tobacco sponsorship of sports events. The White House, meanwhile, grasping for a budget deal, ditched a plan to raise tobacco taxes to pay for children's health care. Yes, this is the White House of Bill Clinton, sworn enemy of smoking, and Al Gore, who delivered that emotional anti-smoking speech at last year's Democratic convention. Mr. Clinton backed down after Senator Trent Lott called the tax a ''deal buster'' in the budget wrangle. But Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a key backer of the cigarette tax, said Mr. Lott was bluffing. ''We would have won this,'' he said.     NATURAL ECONOMICS  Planet for Sale (Not Cheap)  A price tag for nature? A dollar value for our planet? Absurd. If a nuclear disaster makes the earth uninhabitable, we can't exactly stroll into Earth Depot and order a new one. But we live, alas, in a society that simply loves doing studies, loves hunching over calculators and spewing out numbers. So, inevitably, the journal Nature just put the value of 17 ''ecosystem services'' (sounds like Roto-Rooter: ''Here to clean your ecosystem, ma'am'') at, conservatively, $33 trillion. But wait. Beyond the absurdity, there's something to this. We constantly make economic choices about nature -- we just don't focus on the cost. An example: New York City water. It's still good, but getting worse because society made a bunch of economic choices not to protect the watershed. Now the city must spend $660 million to protect the watershed -- unless it wants to spend $4 billion for a water-treatment plant. Another example: a growing region builds malls on a flood plain, and the flooding simply moves elsewhere, with more devastating force. Economic choices everywhere. The point of issuing that obviously debatable number is to remind people that those choices, often nearly invisible, are made constantly.    ENVIRONMENT  Welcome Mat for Polluters?  ''Pollution credits'' have seemed like odd creations ever since they were born in 1990. A company that's less filthy than the law allows need not wait for heavenly recompense -- it can sell its virtuous deed right here on earth, a license for filth that can be snapped up by some less fastidious outfit. Or some benevolent soul can buy credits and simply retire them. But in a new twist at this sooty bazaar, Gov. George E. Pataki is offering pollution credits as little Welcome-to-New-York door prizes for companies that relocate to the state. Environmentalists are not amused.    MARKETING DEALS  Tiger Woods, Blazing  Tiger Woods is having one heck of a run in his 15 minutes of fame. He's young, he's a superstar, and he has stormed the white citadel of golf. Outlandish as it may seem, he may even be bigger than Michael Jordan. (''He's fading,'' one observer decreed.) And is he cashing in! No superstar could get by on a trifling $2 million in golf earnings, but weren't those Nike and Titleist contracts, together worth $60 million, enough? Apparently not. Last week, Tiger Woods signed a five-year contract -- reportedly worth $13 million -- to become a spokesman for American Express. And what does being a golf whiz have to do with credit cards? Oh, you just don't understand marketing.    MANAGED CARE  Reforming Health Reform  The word ''reform'' normally brings to mind something battered with age","excerpt":"welfare, to its critics, fit that description perfectly. But last week a Connecticut legislator used the word in a startling context, talking of ''reforming managed care.'' Huh? Managed health care is still in its infancy -- well, early adolescence, maybe -- and was itself created to ''reform'' a health system in dire need of repair. To many people, though, it, too, already needs repair, and last week Connecticut tried to do just that as legislators passed a bill to let the state overturn managed-care companies' rulings on what treatments they will cover. The industry fought the proposal, saying external review was unnecessary because of in-house appeals processes. But lawmakers were swayed more by testimony from hundreds of customers outraged at being denied what they considered reasonable care.    PRISON HEALTH CARE  Economics Behind Bars  Politicians have this thing about being tough on prisoners. It's not enough to deprive someone of sweet, irreplaceable liberty -- they are determined not to appear to ''coddle'' inmates. New York City's jailers are convinced that many prisoners go to clinics as a social occasion, as a break in the grim routine -- and no doubt some do. But when the Giuliani administration last week proposed charging inmates fees for medical care, it outraged prisoner-rights advocates. True, the fee would just be $3, and would be waived for those deemed indigent. But critics say that's a substantial sum for an inmate with limited resources, and they argue that it would lead to delays in seeking care -- and possibly to far more costly treatment later. With contagious diseases lurking in jails, ''it is pretty stupid'' to make it harder to get care, a Legal Aid official said.    MEDICAL RESEARCH  Progress vs. Progress  Medical research keeps bestowing priceless gifts on humankind -- gifts like the discovery, a decade ago, of a way to screen pregnant women for Down syndrome. But our world takes on a bizarre symmetry sometimes -- even as progress gives, progress can take away. No one can deny that lawsuits have evolved into a high art, but it is an art that is not, well, always used to improve the human condition. Take that Down syndrome test: Dr. Mark Bogart discovered the hormonal link that the test is based on, then patented it, then demanded that laboratories pay him a $9 royalty every time they used it (a fee sometimes higher than a lab's reimbursement), then threatened lawsuits against labs that refused. And even though legal experts don't think the patent will survive court scrutiny -- it's ''a little like patenting Newton's law of gravity,'' one said -- some labs are settling, while others are dropping the test. Progress, full circle.    WAGES AT THE BOTTOM  Catching a Rising Tide  If a civilization is judged by wage inequality, the United States gets dismal marks for its record of the last two decades. For even as executive pay has gone through the roof, the wages of workers in the bottom 10 percent of the wage heap have slid 20 percent, adjusted for inflation. Suddenly, though, in recent months those wages have picked up, now rising faster than inflation -- and faster than middle-income pay. And this, in turn, is luring more people on the fringes into the working world. Why the change? Partly it's the ripple effect of the rise in the minimum wage, but mainly it's just a strong economy creating demand for low-skill workers. Temper your rejoicing, though, for the low-wage worker's lot in life, because the recent upturn makes only a tiny dent in that two-decade loss. And when this economy hits a bump, it won't always be top executives tightening belts.    GRADUATING TO JOBS  Downsizing's Children  Remember downsizing? Remember how some nonbelievers said meekly that corporate America was perhaps overdoing it and might one day, its ranks threadbare, repent of its ruthlessness? To judge by the rosy job picture for college graduates, the nonbelievers were right. Schools everywhere have seen a record number of recruiters this year, and the job offers are descending like desperate confetti. The explanation, to some: companies blew it, and desperately need to replace those workers they laid off a few years ago.

That is, at least, some information which he can pass along. But we can't even shoot you that knowledge on Jean Cocteau's \\"Eagle With Two Heads.\\" Unfortunately, Mr. Cocteau neglected to make it clear.Apparently his drama, which is spoken at great length in French and which picked a bad day to open at the Little Cine Met yesterday, has something to do with a romance between a melancholy queen and an initially rebellious subject who resembles her long-dead spouse. From the rapturous and reckless embracing which goes on now and again between Edwige Feuillere as the monarch and Jean Marais as the rebel in this film, we gathered this general impression. Something is cooking. That is plain.Also we got the impression, from some sauve pussy-footing that is done in the corridors of Miss Feuillere's palace by Sylvia Monfort and Jacques Varennes, that some sort of plot against the monarch is being engineered, and that the lovers, for some uncertain reason, find this vaguely inconvenient to their romance.But how all these elements dovetail (if they do) and what they're supposed to prove are never transmitted to the audience in the excess of posturing and talk. Slightly intriguing situations which pop up along the way are lost in murky miasmas of fancy but pointless dialogue. And evident pretensions toward symbolism get all tangled up in wooden words.Too bad—because plenty of money and taste have plainly been spent on a handsome physical production. Hapsburg splendor is in the regal sets and the costumes which Miss Feuillere fills out are lovely and flattering. But they all add up to nothing. Now that Mr. Cocteau is in town, maybe he'd like to tell people what this \\"Eagle With Two Heads\\" is all about. We might remind him, too, that the drama critics, who saw it as a play last year, would like to know.

Yet New Zealand's first organized European settlement has evolved into the country's most intensely urban city. It is arguably the intellectual and cultural center of New Zealand.\\n\\nThe setting is stunning: a fine, deep harbor set in a natural amphitheater of densely wooded hills. Clinging tenaciously to the hillsides is a colorful pastiche of timber houses, many dating to colonial times. A narrow crescent of flat land supports a cluster of tall commercial buildings focused around the Civic Center, which forms a new nucleus for the city's cultural amenities. A large open-air plaza, which was completed in late November, provides an urban meeting place for outdoor concerts and events. Enclosing this space is an ensemble of new, older and refurbished buildings. Dominating one end of the Civic Center is the polished armature of the Michael Fowler Center, the city's principal concert venue. Among new buildings is the three-story Wellington Public Library, which opened in December, presenting an undulating facade to the plaza and lining the street with a colonnade of giant steel \\"nikau palms.\\" WHAT'S DOING IN","excerpt":"Wellington"},{"year":"1928","title":"Events aboard Comdr Byrd's Antarctic expedition vessel, the C A Larsen BYRD SHIP TO REACH PORT TOMORROW","excerpt":"Wellington (N.Z.)

This latest screen contribution, known as \\"Waterloo,\\" is a compelling production in many respects, but the actual fighting scenes, despite the imposing hordes of men involved and the careful attention to uniforms of the period, are seldom as impressive as one might expect. The clash of arms savors too much of the work of old melodramas, with swords beating against swords and guns against guns.Of all the characters in this current offering, the best is that of Blücher, who, whether in peace or war, is never seen without his cherished pipe. He is depicted as a genial old soul, one who is eagerly looking forward to the time when his warring days are over and he can settle down to the comforts of home.In the course of the activities of this film, in which there is an unimportant attempt at romance, Blücher's timely aid to Wellington is depicted in an interesting fashion, but the producers, the Bayerische Filmgesellschaft, have neglected to make a point of Wellington's \\"praying for night or Blücher.\\" Wellington's anxiety, however, receives attention and there are some fairly active scenes of the fighting around the Hougomont farmhouse.Throughout the production the director, Karl Grune, fails to give one a sense of time. One might therefore almost surmise that years elapse between the Brussels ball and the Battle of Waterloo.In several sequences Herr Grune reveals marked ability with the camera, especially when he divides the screen in half and shows troops on the march contrasted with people dancing. He also gives some excellent scenes of the gathering of Napoleon's forces, and the episode between Marshal Ney and Napoleon is effectively sketched.Like most film directors, Herr Grune makes Napoleon too much of a poseur. The escape of the Emperor from Elba is clumsily pictured and so are the scenes of Napoleon on the battlefield. Napoleon might be the director of a motion picture arrayed in uniform rather than a man directing the fighting of nations. Also, it is somewhat disappointing that this film does not show Napoleon being captured after entering his carriage.The ballroom scenes are agreeably executed, but the romance means precious little.Wellington is somewhat flattered in appearance by Humberstone Wright, who gives a sane and pleasing performance. Fritz Ulmer is satisfactory as Gneisenau. Blücher is played by Otto Gebuhr. Carl de Vogt impersonates Marshal Ney, and Charles Vanel portrays Napoleon. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Wellington and Bluecher.
