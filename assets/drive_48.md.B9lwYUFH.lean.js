Here is some help: money-saving tips on everything from hotel rooms to cultural events from New York Times correspondents and contributors in 15 major European cities.       Although the cost of living in Madrid has risen in recent years, it is still easy to explore the Spanish capital without depriving yourself of small indulgences. This is, after all, a place where you can order a good bottle of Rioja for less than 12 euros at many fine restaurants.    Where to Eat Cheaply       There are two ways to dine in Madrid: seated before a white tablecloth or perched on a wooden stool at a noisy tapas bar. In the first category, it is hard to beat La Finca de Susana (Arlabán, 4","excerpt":"34-91-369-3557), continuously packed with trendy Spaniards. It serves Spanish Mediterranean dishes like black rice with squid, salt-encrusted dourade and hot leek tart in a minimalist, nonsmoking dining room. Arrive by 8:30 p.m. to get a table. Dinner for two, with wine and an elaborate dessert, is about 40 euros, about $50, at 1.24 euros to the dollar. For a memorable meal of hearty tapas, try the warm boiled octopus, steamed mussels or other specialties from northern Galicia at rustic Maceiras tavern (Huertas, 66; 34-91-429-5818). Dinner for two, with wine, averages 25 euros. To save on meals in Madrid restaurants, order the ''menú del día,'' when offered. This prix-fixe lunch includes three courses and a drink and can cost half as much as ordering à la carte.    Lodging for Under 100 Euros       Several stylish hotels in Spain's new Petit Palace chain (www.hthotels.com) drop their rates to as low as 85 euros on low-occupancy days. But for a deal year round, try the central, family-run Hotel Plaza Mayor (Atocha, 2; 34-91-360-0606; www.h-plazamayor.com), which opened in 1997 next to the Plaza Mayor. The 34 air-conditioned rooms are clean and contemporary with marble baths. A standard double is 79 euros.    Best Deal on a Cultural Event       The city's many flamenco bars offer weekly performances that are less expensive and more authentic, many would argue, than the tourist-packed shows at the traditional tablaõs. The Sala Juglar (Lavapies, 37; 34-91-528-4381, www.salajuglar.com) features young flamenco dancers on Sunday nights with a five-euro admission. Well-known singers belt out the yearning cante jondo on Tuesday nights for 18 euros. Cardamomo (Echegaray, 15; 34-91-369-0757; www.cardamomo.net) has jazz-flamenco jam sessions on Wednesday nights. Admission is free. From May 30 to June 11, the government-sponsored Suma Flamenca festival (www.sumaflamenca.com), featuring Enrique Morente, Carmen Linares and other flamenco stars, is also good value. Tickets are 20 to 25 euros.    Best Things to Do Free       An after-dusk stroll through Spain's nightlife capital is a free spectacle. The people-watching is at its finest, and lights bathe the historic buildings and fountains, adding the glamour missing by day. For the best lighting effects, start at the Cibeles Fountain, walk up Calle Alcalá to the bustling Puerta del Sol (watch your wallet) and continue along the Calle Arenal to the glowing Royal Palace. Or detour to the Plaza Mayor, ablaze with outdoor cafes.    Best Money-Saving Tip       You can save up to 65 percent on the price of a double room at participating hotels with Bancotel vouchers (34-91-509-6122; www.bancotel.com). The vouchers are 50 euros each, and they are sold in books of five. Some moderately priced chain hotels accept a single 50-euro voucher a night. Upscale lodgings require two or three.

It's a nice concept -- but one that's often hard to pull off when you are an American tourist traveling through Europe and struggling to find ways to offset the weakness of the dollar. Here is some help: money-saving tips on everything from hotel rooms to cultural events from New York Times correspondents and contributors in 15 major European cities.       You may have to pay to stay in Barcelona, but you don't have to pony up too much to play in it. Barca's best diversions -- the vast parks of Montjuic and La Ciutadella, the Gaudi-accented boulevards like Passeig de Gracia, the sun-drenched beaches, or the bustle of La Rambla -- have always been free, and there are plenty of ways to get a lot of enchantment for your euro.    Where to Eat Cheaply       Tapas would be an easy choice here -- especially in the Raval neighborhood behind the appetite-whetting Boquería Market, where the stalls heave with produce and succulent cured meats and cheeses. You can put together a meal for two for less than 10 euros, $12.40, at 1.24 euros to the dollar. At midday, strap on the feedbag. Most restaurants offer specially priced lunch menus with two or three hearty courses often costing less than 10 euros, including a glass of wine and coffee or dessert. And even in the trendiest establishments, the waiter will almost never bring the check until you ask for it, so sip slowly and soak up the sun and atmosphere beachfront at the Carpe Diem Lounge Club (Passeig Maritim 32","excerpt":"34-93-224-0470; www.cdlcbarcelona.com). For a break from traditional Spanish fare, try the new-school Camper FoodBall (Elisabets 9; www.foodball.com), where everything is not only free -- of pesticides and genetic manipulation, that is -- but also certified organic and rolled up into appetizing and easy-to-handle round balls to be eaten with the hands and washed down with fresh juices or hemp beer for less than 10 euros.    Lodging for Under 100 Euros       Barcelona was the birthplace of boutique hotels in Spain, most of which have sprung to life well into the 200-to-300-euro territory. The Hotel Banys Orientals (Argentaria 37; 34-93-268- 8460; www.hotelbanysorientals.com) remains a bargain at 95 euros a night for a double room. It is in the heart of the fancier-by-the-minute Born district, and the rooms are modern and casual with dark-wood tester beds, chunky Parsons tables, and lots of white paint and crisp linens. The hotel restaurant, Sr. Parellada, could also easily top the list of the best values in town.    Best Deal on a Cultural Event       Between the street festivals, strolling balladeers, and impromptu drunken songfests, your next concert may be just around the next corner. But for music in more luxe surroundings, the city's famous opera house, the Liceu (La Rambla 51-59; 34-93-485-9900; www.liceubarcelona.com), has thoughtfully added a junior varsity to its all-star lineup. In productions that are otherwise identical, the ''popular cast,'' as these excellent but nonfamous performers are known, stand in for the divas and divos, who get the night off. Tickets are at least 50 percent cheaper for these performances, with orchestra seats for ''Madama Butterfly'' this June selling for 47.50 euros instead of the usual 115.75 .    Best Things to Do Free       Look around. So much of the city's charm and rhythm comes from doing nothing beyond taking in its rich history and endless capacity for rejuvenation, like the architectural marvel of the medieval palaces that now house a Picasso museum on Calle Montcada or a once fetid harbor that has been resuscitated into Barcelona's typically stylish riff of the Riviera. Even Gaudí's Park Guell used leftover tiles for the vast expanses of mosaic.    Best Money-Saving Tip       Buy a two-to-five-day Barcelona Card (23 to 34 euros) online (www.barcelonaturisme.com) and get a 10-percent discount on the card, which grants free or discounted entry to many museums and attractions, and, perhaps more important, offers unlimited free travel on virtually all of the city's public transport, including the airport train.

It's a nice concept -- but one that's often hard to pull off when you are an American tourist traveling through Europe and struggling to find ways to offset the weakness of the dollar. Here is some help: money-saving tips on everything from hotel rooms to cultural events from New York Times correspondents and contributors in 15 major European cities.       It's easy to vacation on the cheap in Lisbon, which remains very inexpensive by European standards. On the price-entertainment continuum, restaurants are reasonable, taxis are cheap, a memorable night out won't leave you broke, and churches are free. Mysteriously (and marvelously) chain stores like Zara charge less in Lisbon than they do in New York or Paris.    Where to Eat Cheaply       If you're spending a lot on dinner, then you're at the Michelin haunts. Otherwise, you're dining with the locals at Cantinho das Gáveas (Rua das Gáveas, 82-84","excerpt":"351-21-342-6460), in the lively and young Bairro Alto neighborhood, where an authentic Portuguese meal with wine costs less than $25, at $1.24 to the euro. The octopus with rice is especially lovely. Dinner for less than 15 euros a person? No problem at Brusketta (Rua São Felipe Nery, 12-14; 351-21-388-3860), a sleek, barrel-ceiling restaurant that specializes in open-faced sandwiches with innovative tapaslike toppings. Afterward, park yourself at a nearby bar like Bedroom (Rua do Norte, 86; 351-93-730-5866).    Lodging for Under 100 Euros       Pensão (inns) are the best bet for inexpensive stays. Find one that's still run by the woman of the house for the added bonus of Old World granny charm. Pensão Casa de São Mamede (Rua da Escola Politécnica, 159; 351-21-396-3166) is just such a place: clean, charming and conveniently situated near Principe Real. Singles from 65 to 75 euros a night.    Best Deal on a Cultural Event       You'll see lots of ads for fado, the melancholy Portuguese folk music. Don't bother; most shows are cliché, touristy and overpriced. But for 5 to 20 euros, the Portuguese Symphony Orchestra has performances at the Centro Cultural de Belem (Praça do Império, 351-21-361-2400; www.ccb.pt). Admission to national museums and monuments costs around 3 to 5 euros -- and they're free on Sundays until 2 p.m.    Best Things to Do Free       Walk. Everywhere. Just bring comfortable shoes to navigate the hills and cobblestones. For the best views of the city, start in Bairro Alto, cross over to Chiado along Rua Garrett, down to the pedestrian-only Rua do Carmo and up the steep hill to Castelo de São Jorge. (Yes, the bridge that spans the River Tagus does resemble the Golden Gate.) To finish your tour, stroll to Alfama, the city's oldest and best-preserved neighborhood, which still bears traces of its Arab past. Or, if you're feeling lazy, simply hop the vintage No. 28 tram for the same effect.    Best Money-Saving Tip       You'll be hard-pressed to break the bank in Lisbon unless you go on a shopping spree. Limit your spending (and the hassle of extra carry-on baggage) and buy only one gorgeous Portuguese tile (azulejo). Then photograph the rest. Buildings in Lisbon are remarkably well-preserved, clean, and beautiful; even an amateur will take amazing pictures that make for excellent, frame-ready souvenirs.

The new place, with a name that telegraphs its essence, is indeed situated in a handsomely restored firehouse, the Vigilant Hose Company No. 3 (Westport's first firehouse), just off U.S. 1. To accentuate the building's origins, there are axes, a rolled-up hose and firemen's coats and helmets hanging on the brick walls of the compact dining area, which seats 38. A black ceiling, with pin lights and hanging lanterns, sets off the red brick simply and attractively. To the right of the entrance a fire burns in the large brick oven, while pizza chefs use huge wood piels to place and remove the pies over the fire.   The decor is spare and so is the menu. There are 18 types of toppings for the pizza, 4 fillings for calzones, 2 salads and 2 breads, focaccia and bruschetta. Occasionally desserts are also on the menu.   Actually the pizzas are so generous, there's not much need for anything else. A shared spinach salad, too generous for two, was a welcome mixture of large spinach leaves, warm bacon squares, fresh mushroom slices, hard-boiled egg halves, strips of Swiss cheese and canned black olives, with a creamy peppercorn dressing (which was on the bland side).    We intended to order different small pizzas and share them, but our waiter said, \\"One is really enough for two.\\" He was right. Even at that, the 14-inch pizza, which was listed as small on the menu, meant bagging three slices to take home. (The large pizza is 18 inches.)   We were encouraged to order half one kind, half another, so we tried the Whitey Valiante and the pizza alla cioppino, both with seafood toppings that seemed compatible. The undistinguished crust had the thinness of a cracker with a cracker-like crunchiness, but was piled high on one half (the Whitey) with clams (tasty but chewy) that rang with the flavor of garlic, oregano and olive oil, with a layer of melted mozzarella. The cioppino half combined calamari and clams over a thin layer of mildly seasoned fra diavolo sauce, then topped with Romano and Parmesan cheeses. Mussels were supposed to be included as well, but were missing. Even so, the notable factor in both pizza halves was the sheer abundance of ingredients. Unlike some pizza parlors, where skimpy ingredients are concealed under an avalanche of molten cheese, the De Rosa pizzas were piled generously with the menu-listed ingredients and minimal tomato sauce and cheese. A nice change.    The same lavishness prevailed on other days in a split pizza: half firefighter Dominic Zeoli (pomodori, mozzarella and a plethora of bacon and sauteed onion slices) and pizza alla Palma (profusions of sliced fresh mushrooms, Italian sausage chunks, green and red pepper strips and the expected pomodori and mozzarella). In this instance, the crust was thicker and more bread-like.    In every instance, whichever pizza we ordered, the key ingredients dominated the pie, sprinkled throughout with great magnanimity. For 50 cents extra each, 11 different ingredients are available as additions, but we wonder how the thin crust could bear any additional weight.   Pizzerias abound these days, in Westport and elsewhere, and some feature unusually imaginative topping combinations. At De Rosa's Brick Oven Pizza at the Firehouse, the pies are more traditional, but what gives this small place its signature is its generosity, both in the size of pizzas and the abundance of ingredients used. There is no liquor license but there are a few wines by the glass and a small beer selection that includes the New Haven-produced Elm City beer. A La Carte    Anyone who thinks Japanese cuisine consists mostly of sushi, sashimi, tempura, sukiyaki and teriyaki, should drop by Kotobuki (457 Summer Street, Stamford","excerpt":"359-4747). The growing number of Japanese people living in and around Fairfield County area has led Kotobuki to expand its menu.  Most of the new items are appetizers like dobin mushi (a broth with mushrooms that is served in a tiny teapot), haze (small white fish and vegetable tempura), yanagawa nobe (an eel dish with burdick root), tiny cooked octopus, marinated bream in boiled sake, nabe yaki udon (noodles with shrimp tempura), mozuku (a kind of seaweed) and age nasu (Japanese eggplant).

(Review: 7/7/89) Southern Style"},{"year":"1993","title":"The City asked Eric Asimov, who writes the $25 and Under column for The Times, to visit restaurants near the city's courthouses. Here are his recommendations. BROOKLYN  GAGE & TOLLNER  (718) 875-5181","excerpt":"372 Fulton Street, near Smith Street, downtown Brooklyn; all major credit cards    The area around Borough Hall is a field of fast-food restaurants, with stores and offices seemingly just filling the spaces between hamburger stands, pizza places and fried-chicken joints. Fortunately, Gage & Tollner, the bastion of seafood and Southern cooking, lives on, its dignified face blinking a little awkwardly in the tackiness of Fulton Mall.   The gas lamps for which the dark mahogany dining room is renowned are not lighted at lunchtime, but even under electric lights the restaurant retains its turn-of-the-century patina, with arching mirrors, felt-covered walls and a ceiling that wears the residue of more than 100 years of tobacco smoke. Office workers, courthouse regulars and politicians are in attendance at lunch, when there is an $18.95 fixed-price three-course meal and quick lunches ranging from $7.95 to $12.95. Otherwise, lunch can rise into the $25 to $40 range.   This is a chance to sample the peppery she-crab soup, big meaty crab cakes, and a wide variety of fish and shellfish dishes, like pan-roasted clam bellies and fried oysters.   Bourbon pecan pie seems like a perfect (Southern) courthouse dessert, not too sweet, but still as excessive as a good prosecutor's oratory. QUEEN    (718) 596-5954; 84 Court Street, near Livingston Street, downtown Brooklyn; cash only    For Italian meals of a less nostalgic nature, try Queen, a relative newcomer at 35 years of age. There is a brightly dowdy, almost middle-American feel to the dining room, with its blond-wood chairs and pastel colors. The food is a cut more inventive than old-style Italian.   Appetizers are so big that jurors hoping to stay awake for closing arguments can make a meal of a dish like sweet fava beans sauteed in butter and olive oil with earthy cremini mushrooms and tender baby artichokes for $8. Those planning to nap the afternoon away can indulge in a main course of homemade ravioli stuffed with a savory puree of cannellini beans and tomato in a tart balsamic vinegar sauce for $13.   Service is friendly yet formal. A waiter supplements the big basket of bread with piping-hot fingers of fried pizza dough tasting faintly of cheese. THE BRONX Court Deli  (718) 993-1380; 96 East 161st Street, South Bronx; cash only    Bronx Borough Hall looms over 161st Street, as busy a block as any in midtown Manhattan. But where are the restaurants? The area has nothing more to offer than a few coffee shops and bars. \\"We just had a tuna fish sandwich sent in from a local pizza joint,\\" one courthouse regular said. \\"We don't have too many five-star places near the courthouse.\\"   When the courthouse regulars do eat out, many go to the Court Deli, a plain but thriving restaurant across the street with linoleum-tile floors, a crowded takeout counter, and gruff but personable waitresses.    Apart from a thick, lusty split pea soup and the sizzling hot dogs, the food is mediocre, probably no better than at Yankee Stadium down the street. The overstuffed sandwiches are generous enough, but pastrami is strictly one-dimensional; it spends too much time on the steam table. But the coffee is good and rich. QUEENS  PASTRAMI KING  (718) 263-1717; 124-24 Queens Boulevard, at 82d Avenue, Kew Gardens; American Express    Jurors assigned to the Kew Gardens courthouse on Queens Boulevard are culinarily fortunate: mavens know that the boulevard is the home of Pastrami King, a classic New York deli that serves world-class pastrami.   Dim, disheveled and full of Formica, this is a place for raucous family gatherings, where babies squeal and adults complain. It's also a clubhouse for the courtroom types and politicos. And it's a place for solitary pleasures, for contemplative chewing of the rich, garlicky pastrami, suffused with an almost vinegary smokiness that comes from 10 to 16 days of soaking and curing over smoldering cedar.   A sandwich is $5.95, and a good-looking, juicy hot dog with sauerkraut is $1.50. Matzoh ball soup ($2) is thin and pallid. MAX'S EATERY  (718) 526-9819; 9504 Sutphin Boulevard, at 95th Avenue, Jamaica; cash only   Jurors at the Jamaica courthouse on Sutphin Boulevard are likely to be a rather hostile group, if the availability of food is any gauge. Simply put, there's not much around. The most worthy spot within walking distance is Max's, an old-time luncheonette several dilapidated blocks south of the courthouse.   Max's does not look much better than the neighborhood. Signs are hand-scrawled, the linoleum-tile floors have seen cleaner days, and coffee is served in plastic foam cups rather than in china mugs. But waitresses call you \\"Hon,\\" and the polyglot clientele of residents, construction workers and courthouse personnel exudes an aura of good feelings. The Maxi-Burger is big and juicy, served on a fresh poppy-seed roll and strewn with fried onions ($4.70 with bacon and cheese). There are also thick sandwiches and egg creams, and Max Rogalski himself, an aged presence, oversees his bustling staff, lunching on two slices of tomato. STATEN ISLAND  LIL'S EATERY  (718) 273-9555; 95 Stuyvesant Place, at Hamilton Avenue, St. George; cash only    For Staten Islanders, who serve their jury duty within walking distance of the ferry to Manhattan, the temptation to hop aboard for a lunch trip must be great. Rather than risk a tardy return, though, jurors tend to restrict themselves to several fast-food spots in the area, or to Lil's Eatery, a small luncheonette decorated with posters that pay charming homage to stars who met tragic ends, like Elvis Presley, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland.   Lil's is a smoky place, with fluorescent lights, Formica tables and an ancient jukebox at each booth, with choices ranging from Bing Crosby to Prince. The menu doesn't stray far from breakfast dishes, sandwiches and burgers. An onion-and-pepper omelet ($5.25) was greasy, and pancakes ($4.95) were doughy, but service was friendly and agreeable. Lil's offers more ambitious specials, like pasta with eggplant for $11.95 and shrimp creole for $12.95. Given the limited choices in the area, I vote for experimentation. MANHATTAN  NHA TRANG  (212) 233-5948; 87 Baxter Street, Chinatown; cash only    With Chinatown right next door to the various courthouses, the choices for the Manhattan juror can be paralyzing. Nha Trang, a plain storefront restaurant with terrific Vietnamese food, stands out. There's a huge menu of more than 100 dishes. Some of the best include perfectly fried spring rolls ($3.50); steamed ravioli, rice-noodle crepes wrapped around minced pork and ground mushrooms, served with mild Vietnamese pork sausage ($3.50), and barbecued shrimp on sugar cane ($5.25). A full meal should cost less than $15. O.K. Jurors, Recess.

For a long time now, the Capablanca policy has been successfully used by strong players, principally by such cautious souls as Tigran Petrosian, the Soviet Armenian who was world champion from 1963 to 1969. Most recently it was put into effect by the Worcester, Mass., grandmaster Ilya Gurevich in the Winter Tournament of the Marshall Chess Club, at 23 West 10th Street. In this event, which ran from Jan. 31 to Feb. 13, Gurevich went undefeated in amassing the winning 8-3 score. Against his fellow grandmasters, he drew in 12 moves with Roman Dzindzichashvili of Queens and in 22 moves with John Fedorowicz of Manhattan. FINAL STANDINGS  Player . . . Country . . . Points . . .

Ukraine . . . 4 . . .  Arnett . . . U.S. . . . 3 1/2   Gurevich defeated Rafail Klovsky of Ukraine with a sharp pawn-winning series of tactics in Round 2.   Against the Tarrasch Variation of the French Defense with 3 Nd2, Klovsky adopted 3 . . . Nf6 to lure the white center on with 4 e5. Quite soon, he whittled down this bastion with 8 . . . f6 9 ef Nf6 which also gave him the mobility to defend his kingside.   After 10 Ne2, it may be that Black does not need 10 . . . Qc7. A reasonable alternative is 10 . . . Bd6 11 O-O O-O 12 Bf4 Bf4 13 Nf4 Ne4 14 Qc1 Ng5 15 Ng5 Qg5 16 Ne2 Qf6.   The plan underlying 10 . . . Qc7 is that after 11 . . . Bd6, White cannot exchange off his queen bishop against the black king bishop. The purpose is further served by 14 . . . Nh5, which prepares 15 Bg3 Ng3 16 hg, thus preserving the d6 bishop to guard the slightly weak dark squares.   Gurevich remarked that his 17 Nb6!? is a new move. On 17 . . . Ra7, the black queen rook is out of play, while after 17 . . . Rb8, Gurevich boldly snatched a pawn with 18 Ba6!?   Klovsky did not knuckle under with 18 . . . ba 19 Rc6, nor fall into 18 . . . Nb4 19 Bb5 Na2 20 Rc8 Rbc8 21 Nc8 Rc8 22 Qa4! Nb4 23 Bd7, which wins a decisive pawn and simultaneously unhinges the black position. He struck back with 18 . . . Nd4 19 Nd4 ba 20 Nc8 Rbc8 21 Rc8 Rc8, when 22 Ne6? would be crunched by 22 . . . Qe5!, winning a piece.   Still, Gurevich's analysis had gone a lot farther, as his 22 Re1! showed. After 22 . . . Bb4 (22 . . . e5? 23 Nf5! gf 24 Qd5 Qf7 25 Qd6 is overwhelming for White) 23 Qg4! Qf7 24 Rd1, there was no defense by 24 . . . Re8 because of 25 Ne6 Qe6 26 Qb4.   On 24 . . . Ng7 25 Ne6! Rc4 26 Nd4 Nf5, Gurevich coolly forced the game into a pawn-ahead ending with 27 b3 Rd4 28 Rd4 Nd4 29 Qd4.   After 38 Qb7!, there was no use for the Ukrainian to go on: 38 . . . Qg8 39 f4 Kh6 40 Qg7 Qg7 41 Bg7 Kg7 42 Kf2 brings about an elementary king-and-pawn ending","excerpt":"38 . . . d4 39 Bd4 Qe1 40 Kg2 accomplishes nothing because Gurevich had precisely guarded against 40 . . .

Many rooms don't have bathrooms, and breakfast is not included, but there's a real homey feel to the place (complete with a live-in poodle). Imagine that your interior designer had opted for Italian kitsch as your home's main design scheme and you'll get the picture. A double is 85 euros a night.    Best Deal on a Cultural Event       A visit to the museum at the Castello Sforzesco (Sforza Castle) includes a glimpse of a ceiling most likely decorated by Leonardo, and the so-called Pietà Rondanini, a statue of the Madonna and Christ that Michelangelo was working on at the time of his death. Apart from providing a glimpse of how Milan's ruling aristocracy once lived (grandly), it's a real hodgepodge of a collection, from significant examples of Lombard paintings to a wacky ensemble of musical instruments. All this for 3 euros. The Parco Sempione, Milan's largest park, abuts the castle and is open to the public, free.    Best Things to Do Free       The paint has barely dried on the walls of the recently restored Villa Belgiojoso Bonaparte Museum, a neo-Classical palace built for the Milanese nobleman Lodovico Barbiano di Belgiojoso that now houses a large collection of paintings and sculptures from the 18th and 19th centuries (including sculptures by Medardo Rosso, busts by Antonio Canova and paintings by Francesco Hayez and Daniele Ranzoni). Near the Castello Sforzesco, the small Civic Aquarium with its array of sea dwellers has also just reopened after a three-year renovation, and it's free.    Best Money-Saving Tip       The Mediateca Santa Teresa (Via della Moscova 28; 39-02-873-9781) is a multimedia interactive library that offers free access to the Internet. All you need is an identification document, like a passport, and to fill out a form. In an expensive city like Milan, public transport is a cheap and surprisingly reliable way to get around. Day tickets cost 3 euros and last 24 hours from the time they are stamped. A 48-hour ticket is 5.50 euros.

Exploit (Via Pioppette 3","excerpt":"39-02-894-08675), near the columns of San Lorenzo, a standing reminder of long gone Roman colonizers, is a popular spot where 6 euros ($7.45, at $1.24 to the euro) will get you a drink and a broad assortment of snacks: minipizzas, Parmesan cheese chunks or meatballs. Teatro 7 (Via Civerchio 9; 39-02-699-00702; www.teatro7.com) is one of Milan’s most talked-about restaurants, in part because of the trendy décor and the open kitchen where clients can watch the flamboyant chefs Rico Guarnieri and Claudio Colombo Severini cook up improbably complicated delicacies, and in part because the food is so good.

It's a nice concept -- but one that's often hard to pull off when you are an American tourist traveling through Europe and struggling to find ways to offset the weakness of the dollar. Here is some help: money-saving tips on everything from hotel rooms to cultural events from New York Times correspondents and contributors in 15 major European cities.       If you are content to merely wander the streets and absorb the city's magical atmosphere, Venice may be one of the cheapest places on earth to visit. It's quite something else if you want to do basic things like, say, sleep and eat there. Even so, pennies can be pinched.    Where to Eat Cheaply       Snack like the Venetians and head for the local bacari, where finger-food appetizers (called cicchetti) can substitute for lunch. Typically, nibbles -- like polenta with whipped cod, deep-fried shrimp or toasted bread with salami -- run from 1 to 2 euros each ($1.24 to $2.48). The Italian-style tapas usually get downed with an ombra (shadow) or a glass of white wine, starting at about a euro a glass.

Venetians also flock to the Pizzeria Ae Oche (Dorsoduro 1414; 39-041-520-6601) on the Zattere, the quay that faces the Giudecca Island.

Which explains the affordability of the Hotel Marin (Ramo delle Chioverete 670b; 39-041-718-022) in the Santa Croce neighborhood, just across the Grand Canal from the train station. The hotel has no frills (no TV or Internet) but clean doubles for 95 euros a night in high season. Check the tourist board Web site, www.turismovenezia.it, for wide-ranging options including bed-and-breakfasts.    Best Deal on a Cultural Event       The 18-euro Museum Pass will get you into nine of Venice's civic museums including the Doge's Palace and glass and lace museums on the islands of Murano and Burano. And if you can stand crowds, you can time your trip to coincide with one of several yearly festivals. During the Festa del Redentore, which falls on the third weekend in July, fireworks lure Venetians to the Giudecca Canal to participate in the city's most heart-felt religious celebration. And throngs line the Grand Canal each September to thrill to boat races and watch the Historic Regatta, a costumed recreation of the welcome given to Caterina Cornaro, Queen of Cyprus, when she ceded that island to the Venetian Republic in 1489.    Best Things to Do Free       The Parco Savorgnan, a public park hidden behind the Palazzo Venier in the Cannaregio neighborhood, is a lovely green oasis where you can wind down after hours of nonstop bridge hopping. Venturing a little farther off, Venice has been known for its blown glass since the Middle Ages, and the tradition continues on the island of Murano where you can visit one of several glass-making factories and watch masters carry on a nearly thousand-year-old trade. A visit requires a short vaporetto ride on the lagoon. The best transportation bargain comes with the so-called Venice Card, a one-, three- or seven-day ticket that lets you float freely around the lagoon, and offers discounts on major exhibits, some bars and restaurants, entrance into several churches and access to toilets. Prices vary for the card, depending on the services and length of stay. Check them out at www.venicecard.com.    Best Money-Saving Tip       Instead of paying a minimum of 80 euros for a 45-minute gondola ride, pay 50 cents to take one of Venice's public gondolas across the Grand Canal. The traghetto is a far less romantic experience -- you're usually crammed in and you're unlikely to be serenaded -- but at least you can say you've done the gondola thing.

Rome is quickly earning a reputation as one of Europe's most expensive cities.

That said, it is still possible to enjoy la dolce vita without emptying your bank account.

Lodging for Under 100 Euros       In recent years, hotels in Rome have approached New York City prices, and you'll be hard-pressed to find anything decent for less than 100 euros a night.

Best Deal on a Cultural Event       Many of Rome's most stunning churches and palazzi are regularly the sites of free or low-price classical music performances. Among the best of these is the concert series in the Borromini Sacristy of the Sant'Agnese in Agone church in the Piazza Navona. There, every Sunday at 8 p.m., you can enjoy music by the likes of Haydn, Chopin, Schumann or Mozart. Tickets are 12 euros; 40 euros will gain you access to five concerts. The current season runs to June 25.    Best Things to Do Free       Perhaps the best thing about Rome is that many of its star attractions are free and relatively close to one another. Begin your day by people-watching at the Trevi Fountain, then walk 10 minutes west to the Pantheon to gaze inside the building itself, ancient Rome's best-preserved architectural marvel. The tomb of the painter Raphael is also there. Just west of the Pantheon is the Piazza Navona, home to Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers. If you have any energy left, cap it off with a trip to St. Peter's Basilica, about a 25-minute walk. Admission lines are generally long, but the reward once you're inside is astounding. The Vatican Museums, which include the Sistine Chapel, are closed Sundays, except for the last Sunday of the month, when they are open free from 8:45 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. (but you must enter before 12:20 p.m.).    Best Money-Saving Tip       For food, explore the markets in the Campo dei Fiori and Piazza Testaccio, as well as the Nuovo Mercato Esquilino, a block east of the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II. All have fresh produce, meat, cheese and fish, and they're open from about 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., every day but Sunday. (The Esquilino market has later hours.)
