If it was ever justified, it certainly isn't any more, since Mr. Heaney, though he was born in Northern Ireland, is now an Irish citizen and makes his home in Dublin.

For instance, homeowners can be prevented by ordinance from putting a pool or a tennis court too close to a neighbor's property line.

Enormous granite boulders shouldered up against the beaches.  The ocean was the color of rain, and the wind smelled fishy. Ducking in and out of my car that day, I wasn't surprised that witches had thrown hexes on this spot, or that sea monsters had been sighted here by reliable witnesses, or that pirates had divvied up blood money on the rocks. Or, especially when I glanced up at the widow's walks crowning a few old houses near the shore, that thousands of mariners had drowned off this coast. Cape Ann, as far as I could see, had that grim obduracy that fosters both legends and bad dreams.

Mutz, chairman of Amli Realty Company of Chicago and developer of the 432-acre Amhurst Lake Business park, about 40 miles north of the Chicago Loop, said he hopes the Bears will decide to build their domed stadium in the heavily wooded park. The temporary one is a 60-foot high air-supported bubble covering an artificial turf base 260 by 200 feet.\\n\\n\\"We hope to be able to address the Bears' long-term space needs,\\" said Mr. Mutz, noting that the park, with about 50 acres under development, has ample room if the team decides to make Waukegan its permanent home. The $1-a-year rent will rise to market value in the third year of the three-year lease.\\n\\n\\"This location offers the shortest drive from our headquarters,\\" said the Bears president, Michael B. McCaskey. \\"With our team players practicing three or four days in a row, it makes sense.\\" \\n\\nThe Bears' headquarters is eight miles south, on the campus of Lake Forest College, where they maintain a regulation-size, outdoor football field as well as a 70-yard practice field. The team hopes to build what is known as \\"McDome Stadium\\" with state assistance included in a bill for subsidizing the $1.385-billion expansion of the lakefront McCormick Place exhibition hall complex. The bill is expected to be introduced in the Legislature soon, but its passage is considered doubtful because of the weakening economy and the lame-duck status of Gov. Jim Thompson, who supports it. \\n\\nFor Amli Realty, the Bears' arrival is timely. The company has nearly completed a speculative three-story, 100,000-square-foot office building as well as a one-story, 58,000 square-foot office-warehouse building. But with the soft office market in metropolitan Chicago, leasing activity is slow. The only fully leased building is a custom-built, 9,369-square-foot child-care center, with a capacity of 140 children.\\n\\nThe business park is at the southern tip of the city, bounded by Route 41 to the east and Route 43 to the west, within minutes of the tri-state thruway that goes north to Milwaukee and south to Chicago.\\n\\nThe business park is on the former 1,200-acre estate of Thomas E. Wilson, the meat-packer. The city annexed 640 acres of the property in 1987.

Before tackling the typewriter (in collaboration with Bernard C. Schoenfeld) to paint a bleak picture of conditions in a state prison for women, the industrious Miss Kellogg had herself committed to four state penitentiaries over a period of two months to gather first-hand material for the Warner Brothers film, \\"Caged,\\" which opened yesterday at the Strand Theatre.Miss Kellogg might have spared herself the trouble, for her script, as it has emerged in pictorial form, at least, is no great shakes. \\"Caged\\" plays awfully hollow. There is a prevailing synthetic atmosphere about the picture which defeats whatever real basis the story may have. Definitely the script is at fault, because the direction of John Cromwell manages now and again to bring individual scenes to throbbing life. The insurrection of the female prisoners, the raving madness of an inmate and the frustration of life behind bars emerge crisply and often frighteningly.But on the whole, \\"Caged\\" is a cliché-ridden account of institutional brutality and depravity. Granted that the complexities of our society may frequently result in prison terms for innocent accomplices in crime, such as the unfortunate girl portrayed by Eleanor Parker in \\"Caged,\\" it does not necessarily follow, as the picture insists, that prisons breed hardened criminals. In this respect, we venture to say that the Warner Brothers and Miss Kellogg have tipped the scales of justice.All the ugliness of prison life is dramatized in \\"Caged\\" through the experiences of a 19-year-old unfortunate whose husband, in desperation, stuck up a gasoline station and was killed in the process. His wife, who did not realize what her husband was up to, receives a one to fifteen-year term","excerpt":"bears her child in prison and through association with murderers, pickpockets, hopheads, and,—as the film calls them, \\"C. P.s, or common prostitutes\\"—becomes, herself, an unregenerate social outcast. Jerry Wald, usually an astute producer with a knack for blending the fictitious and the realistic, permitted this particular story to get out of hand.Dramatically speaking there are several electric moments in this depiction of women caged up and hounded by keepers who themselves appear as likely candidates for mental institutions. The savage rebellion of the ladies in Cell C (or was it B!) who wreck the dormitory in a display of frenzy after an inmate commits suicide when the parole board turns her down, is a harrowing experience, fully descriptive of the old adage that \\"hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\\"Miss Parker gives a creditable and expressive performance as the unfortunate heroine. Hope Emerson is vicious and inexorable as the Amazonian, corrupt guard, and Agnes Moorehead is splendid in the role of the humane warden who earnestly tries to give the prisoners a decent life but is thwarted by venal and indifferent political interference. There is much in \\"Caged\\" that rings true, but unfortunately there is too much that appears to be contrived.Xavier Cugat and his orchestra head the Strand's stage show, which also includes Abbe Lane, Tato and Julia; George Lopez, Otto Bolivar, Dulcina, Otto Garcia and Herkie Styles.
