Women in the Military  An Unfinished Revolution  By Maj. Gen. Jeanne Holm, U.S.A.F. (Ret.)  544 pages. Presidio Press. $27.50.  Honor Bound  A Gay American Fights for the Right to Serve His Country  By Joseph Steffan  Illustrated. 245 pages. Villard Books. $22.50.   For the first time in two warring centuries, a black four-star general is leading the American armed forces. A poster from the film \\"Glory,\\" about the black Massachusetts regiment whose bravery in Union blue is largely overlooked in the history books, hangs in the anteroom of Gen. Colin L. Powell's Pentagon office. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff displays similar mementos of the role played by blacks in other American wars. To older veterans who remember the prejudice in Southern training camps and even on segregated battlefields, the Powell phenomenon is still remarkable to ponder on Veterans Day.
