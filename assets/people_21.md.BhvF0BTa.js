He is, without overplaying in slapstick, perhaps one of the most consistently amusing comedians. In all his pictures he is case in identical rôles, the embarassed, spineless creature who emerged finally as the glorified hero through a fluke of circumstance.In \\"Wide Open\\" he has a scheme to make his employer's business prosper but hasn't enough courage to offer it to him. The daughter of the owner of the plant finally resorts to a subterfuge and sneaks into his house and steals the plans. This brings about a dilemma in which the two of them are discovered together and taken for man and wife. After a number of ludicrous situations everything is straightened out and he becomes the head of the plant, marries the girl and punches the villian on the nose, thus acquitting himself nobly all around.With such a situation and plenty of hilarious, fast dialogue, Mr. Horton is decidedly at an advantage. Patsy Ruth Miller is competent as the pretty burglar as is T. Roy Barnes as the flippant salesman.A revival of the silent film, \\"Lady Windermere's Fan,\\" which was directed by Ernest Lubitsch, is on this same program. E.E.

HBO's first \\"On  Location\\" comedy special, starring Robert Klein, changed the very nature of comic acts on television. For the first time, stand-up routines were unedited and uncensored. The performers could say pretty much what they wanted to say. In the cases of Roseanne and Tim Allen (courtesy of Showtime), routines were transformed into full-fledged and enormously successful sitcoms. The stand-up act became a hardy staple of cablevision.         Well, Mr. Klein is back on the schedule in an \\"HBO Comedy Hour\\" called \\"It All Started Here\\" (the next showing is at 1:05 A.M. tonight). The program, taped at the Forum Theater in Metuchen, N.J., is his sixth stand-up special for HBO. Changes? You bet. He used to project a campus wise-guy-in-sweater sort of persona, but now he's older and considerably crabbier. The hair and the eyebrows look suspiciously darker.

The playwright is tossing off a comedy that's supposed to be about commitment. In it, two pairs of rocky relationships, spanning two generations, are resolved. One involves Fay and Alan Benson, who have worked up a new marriage contract consisting of ''21 articles, 3 unbreakable clauses and 100 rules'' - just to keep tabs on their mutual suspicions of infidelity.

As a lively and buoyant tale of the wistful and hilarious quandries into which a village young man and girl are thrown by the basic fact that the young fellow doesn't have enough money to marry the girl, it is wholly and admirably valid in the entertainment line and throws out some fascinating sidelights on village customs and characters.For instance, the horrendous tangle into which a group of hack drivers get themselves when they try to form a \\"cooperative\\" to run a station bus makes a grand lot of genuine native humor, and a little scene in which two mothers strike a deal for the marriage of a middle-aged man and an old-maid daughter, with the priest umpiring the deal, rings richly true.The characters, too, are delightful and are reflective, beyond any doubt, of the typical villagers in the area of Naples, where Signor Castellani recruited his cast and made his film. A lively girl named Maria Fiore plays the sultry and eccentric miss who is prevented from marrying the hero by her willful father, the fireworks-maker in the town. And a strapping chap, Vincenzo Musolino, is grandly explosive and harassed as the poor man who has to support his family and earn a dowry for his sister before he can take a wife. As his mother, Filomena Russo, is wonderfully fluent with Italian gestures and moods, and Luigi Astarita, Carmela Cirillo and many others are fine in lesser roles.But it must be said that Signor Castellani and those who worked with him on the script have used parental opposition only as a contrivance for their tale. When they have spun out sufficient complications and incidents with this device, they easily arrange for their young lovers to solve their dilemma naturally.The consequence is that the picture—which, by the way, won the grand prize at the Cannes Film Festival last spring—is flavorsome and impressive, undeniably realistic and aptly paced, but it misses a convincing conveyance of the real pathos that lies somewhere within its tale. THE SCREEN IN REVIEW","excerpt":"Comedy From Italy, 'Two Cents Worth of Hope,' Is Featured at the World Theatre"},{"year":"1951","title":"\\"The Treasure,\\" a harmless comedy-romance from Poland that opened yesterday at the downtown Irving Place Theatre, is hardly a treasure. It comes off, though, on an unassuming low-budget level, as a reasonably pleasant, occasionally sprightly little story of young love trying to get along among the ruins and pillar-to-post living conditions of present-day Warsaw.On the credit side are nice photography and direction, some owlish characterizations by a gallery of Polish family types and a rather ingenious plot idea. Unluckily, it runs far too long and pulls a good many punches along the way, which is why it rates a light pat on the head instead of a whack on the back.The action focuses on a nice pair of young newlyweds getting off to a dismal start in a makeshift cellar crammed with a varied assortment of good-natured, eagle-eyed tenants who mistake the couple's dream apartment plan for a buried treasure map. The ensuing scramble and climax has everybody, including the stalked innocents, pinned in the cellar with the \\"treasure,\\" an unexploded bomb, dangling by a thread. All ends well, as indeed it should, for these are appealing people, and the two counter-plots—the ironically amusing wild-goose chase and plight of the disarming honeymooners—that they're the same everywhere.Danuta Szaflarska and Jerzy Duszynski, the leads, are picturesque and believable, and so are all the others, for that matter, particularly Adolf Dymsza, Jadwiga Chojnacka and Ludwik Sempolinski.
