By way of consolation we sometimes resort to a variant of fetishism. We take possession of their house. We try to keep it exactly as it had been before. And then the public troops in, hoping to breathe the air of genius.   It is a very difficult thing to do. Earth has not much to show that is more hideous than the home of George Bernard Shaw, playwright and polemicist, at Ayot St. Lawrence in England. Among composers, Beethoven and Hugo Wolf changed apartments almost as often as they changed shirts, and when we turn up at any one of those many addresses it feels as if the great man has just packed his bags, leaving nothing behind him. But among composers Charles Ives did better by us in Connecticut, where his house still has a real stamp of him, and so did Thomas Jefferson and Franklin D. Roosevelt among Presidents, Benjamin Disraeli among British Prime Ministers, Charlotte and Emily Bront\\"e among novelists, Frederick Edwin Church among painters and Buffon among naturalists. To be in their houses is to be in their company, almost palpably, just as we are in the company of Copernicus if we happen to climb up to the little room in the Jagellonian University in Cracow where Copernicus studied astronomy close on 500 years ago.

Those who remembered her usually remembered her as a teacher, one whose influence can be felt most palpably in the work of Diane Arbus. But as an exhibition of Model's work at the International Center of Photography suggests, her photographs are at least as important as her pedagogy.   A contemporary of Weegee's, Model is often thought of as a chronicler of the pretensions of the haves and of the blessed perseverance of the have-nots. She was that, but her work is also much more complicated and compelling. From 1933, when she first began photographing destitute street people in Paris and lolling boulevardiers on the French Riviera, through the 1940's, when she spent most of her time in New York, she took pictures of unsurpassed intensity and directness.
