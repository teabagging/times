But as it bizarrely happened, just such a tremor shook the West End on Monday. Hours before the opening of Mr. Lloyd Webber's \\"Sunset Boulevard,\\" the newspapers gave big play to the unexpected announcement that the West End production of the Broadway hit \\"City of Angels\\" would close after only a four-month run.    \\"City of Angels\\" received rave reviews, and its box-office collapse was blamed on the gravity of the recession and the declining sophistication of West End audiences. Since both \\"Angels\\" and \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" happen to be about Hollywood in the late 1940's, the abrupt failure of the American show cast a particular pall over Mr. Lloyd Webber's gala premiere. Although \\"Sunset\\" boasts the cushion of a large advance sale -- at $:4 million ($6 million), neck and neck with a new revival of \\"Grease,\\" starring Debbie Gibson -- any visitor to its box office last week could discover that seats are readily available, as they are for virtually every West End attraction. No wonder, then, that The Evening Standard ran an editorial on Monday all but praying for the musical's success, reminding its readers that a \\"smash hit show\\" not only \\"lifts our thoughts from humdrum, everyday toils\\" but \\"also draws foreign visitors to London.\\" Critic's Notebook","excerpt":"Upstaging a New Lloyd Webber Musical"},{"year":"2009","title":"Ana Beall‚Äôs, located in a quaint house, has two floors","excerpt":"upstairs are two formal dining rooms seating about 40 and a small gift shop.

The price of a pound of yellowcake, a lightly processed form of uranium ore, has slumped to $7 from a peak of nearly $12 in the summer of 1990. Low though the price is, experts say it may go still lower, because of the unusual economics of the nuclear fuel business. Normally if a commodity's price falls, customers buy more, and the higher demand helps to stabilize prices. But the reactor construction business is moribund, and no one in the United States is likely to break ground on a new reactor because the cost of fuel is cheap. And the customers, as regulated utilities, are unlikely to make bold purchase decisions, for fear of being judged imprudent by regulators if the market turns against them later.

In the midst of the incredible events that began 10 days ago with the attempted coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, President Bush said he had \\"seen nothing to make me change my mind\\" about the group's agreement not to give Moscow direct financial aid until more fundamental steps are taken to establish a market economy.

This is the second recession in two years, and if interest rates go shooting up again when the current slump ends, there could be a third recession close behind.   Although it has been partly obscured by the fog of technical concepts and jargon, a conflict exists between the Administration and the Federal Reserve Board over how monetary policy should be conducted. Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Fed, regards bringing down the rate of inflation as his top priority, and has been telling both the Administration and the public that he does not intend to relax restrictive monetary policy. He told a group of real estate brokers in Florida earlier this week that ''we can't effectively deal with your problems by pumping up the money supply.''
