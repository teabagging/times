I am haunted by the stretched-out fatigued bodies that cling like barnacles to its walls and alcoves.   \\"Help for Grand Central's Homeless\\" (editorial, Nov. 15) describes a campaign by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and public agencies to reach out to the terminal's 2,000 homeless. Why not extend this program to include the assistance of the commuting public?   If each commuter willing to be trained in outreach techniques could be offered one hour a week released time from his or her workplace (either the first or last hour of the day), a corps of commuters who care about the homeless could be created.   We could distribute donated food and clothing. We could encourage enrollment in drug and alcohol-rehabilitation programs. We could also help identify those in need of medical assistance and psychological counseling. And by showing that we care, we could bridge the gap between us.   A flier describing the project, with a reply card to indicate interest, could accompany the monthly commuter pass sent to riders in the mail. Cooperation of employers could be sought by employees who plan to participate, with the aid of newspaper, radio and television public-service announcements. Interest could be encouraged and maintained through the Metro-North newsletter, Milepost.   An outreach partnership of this kind could become a model for other transit terminals where the homeless gather. ROCHEL U.

Others, depending upon their state of mind, may either frown or smile at it. It is actually intended as a forceful argument against companionate marriage, but it has been produced with little imagination and no subtlety. The director, James Flood, evidently prefers to use the sledgehammer rather than the gimlet.This production is the sort of thing that goes very well with the songs that from time to time come from the screen. It defies criticism, for the narrative is framed in a dream, and who knows but that Margaret, the much-married lady of this offering, may not have had just such a nightmare.As one ponders over its valiant attempts to be interesting, it seems that Lorelei Lee might possibly have had something out of the ordinary to say about this film. She might have called it \\"devine\\" or she might have referred to it as \\"really nothing.\\" It isn't anything one wishes to burden one's mind with for long after leaving it.The unfortunate Margaret apparently keeps up a diary during her various marriages. It is her wont, after a short-term marital contract has been broken, to pen something like this:\\"Time is so relentless and I'm not getting any younger.\\"So Margaret becomes a wife again! For a time she appears to make a commercial success of her alliances. One rough diamond gives her a check for $5,000, and an elderly husband settles a quarter of a million on her. She finally squanders this on a gigolo type of husband, who, when he learns that there's no more money in his wife's bank, can't pack up his things fast enough.In the last throes of this adventure or marital gamut, Margaret has bleached hair and sunken eyes. Then comes a fade-out into the fair face of Patsy Ruth Miller, and those who like this sort of thing will be delighted to hear that Margaret agrees that contract marriage is \\"a mess of applesauce.\\"Miss Miller works earnestly and parts of her performance are quite effective. Robert Edeson is natural as the elderly millionaire husband. He does, however, use too much make-up on his eyelids, but that may have been Margaret's idea in her dream of a wealthy old man. Duke Martin does quite well as the caveman sort of husband, who delights in putting his cigar just where it will burn the furniture and so make Margaret frown. As for the other performers they suit the scheme of things in the story. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Companionate Marriage.
