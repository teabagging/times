Editors’ Note"},{"year":"1990","title":"Dance productions have been saying a lot this fall - and not merely with choreographic eloquence. Many have used actual speech - texts recited on tape or by the dancers themselves.   Dancers have reminisced, lectured, chided, prattled, questioned and proclaimed - all in the course of performing in Dance Theater Workshop's \\"Out-of-Towners.\\" This series of programs by visiting soloists and companies at the Bessie Schonberg Theater suggests that dances to words are being made from Puerto Rico to Canada.   Through the use of speech, inventive choreographers can add richness to their creations. Words and movements can be allies, enhancing each other. Or they can be disputants, contradicting each other to produce deliberate ambiguities.   In several works at the Bessie Schonberg, choreography and speech carried on a stimulating dialogue. In others, words completely overpowered movement, and in still others words made the dances unduly perplexing.   One of the best pieces came from Jo Lechay, an American choreographer who has been a member of various companies since the 1960's and who now lives in Montreal. She looked back on her career in \\"Affamee\\" (\\"Starved\\"), an evening-long solo she wrote and choreographed in collaboration with Eugene Lion. Speaking as she moved, she acknowledged both the pleasure and the pain of dancing. Her occasional gasps, stamps and harsh thrusting gestures were convincing evidence that her body had experienced the strains and exhaustion her words described. Yet, she confessed, she could not stop dancing.   Her text revealed that she craved more than an opportunity to dance. She morally hungered for social justice. As she wondered how dancing can possibly aid political reform, her bodily twistings became physical counterparts of her intellectual doubts. However, by continuing to move as she argued with herself, she implied that dance can be valuable simply for its ability to raise serious issues.   Whereas Ms. Lechay constantly blended words and movements, Deborah Riley used words sparingly in her \\"Shifting Perspectives.\\" As a result, the way a text suddenly intruded into her dance helped give it a surprise ending. As performed by Deborah Riley Dance Projects, her company from Washington, \\"Shifting Perspectives\\" began as an apparently abstract study in shifting patterns. Then mayhem broke out. Just as it is not considered fair to disclose the plots of mystery stories, so it is probably best to reveal little about the dramatic details of this choreographic shocker. However, it can be said that its grim conclusion was heightened by a terse recorded statement about violence to women.   Other works by Ms. Riley joined words and movements less effectively. \\"Countdown 2000\\" had a lucid text about equality for women that was far more fervent than the vague struggles Ms. Riley devised for her dancers. The action in \\"Eye to Eye\\" was equally hazy. But the text consisted of clear, crisp anecdotes about mothers and daughters.   Sharon Wyrrick, another Washington choreographer, offered \\"Storyboard for an Anxious Journey,\\" a three-part solo during which she delivered a nonstop monologue. Her topics included a mugging, a death, dirty politics, dirty bottles, spilled milk, oil spills, heart surgery and supermarkets. As she talked, she manipulated objects. She set up and knocked down bowling pins. She snipped with shears at potted plants. She clambered over a giant chessboard. Although her props were eye-catching, nothing she did with them was kinetically memorable, and because her incessant chatter gave equal time to profundities and trivia, she made everything she said sound ultimately unimportant.   A program by Awilda Sterling and Petra Bravo, two choreographic collaborators from Puerto Rico, served as a reminder that if words are to be eloquent they must first be understood. Foreign languages may require translation.   Because dance is nonverbal, lovers of that art often boast that it can surmount all barriers to comprehension. Their contention may be exaggerated, for dances do not arise out of vacuums. Rather, they are created in specific social contexts. Anyone unfamiliar with a country's traditions may well be baffled by some of its choreographic conventions. Nevertheless, there are times when dancers expressing strong states of love, hate, despair and hope find themselves almost instantly comprehended by audiences of various national backgrounds.   Ms. Sterling and Ms. Bravo, though capable dancers, never worked such magic. Their offerings were accompanied by texts in Spanish for which no translations were provided, and non-Spanish-speakers might have found them mystifying.   \\"Those Days of the Month,\\" for instance, appeared to show shabbily dressed workingclass women concerned with fitness and hygiene. The title could be a phrase referring to a woman's menstrual period","excerpt":"according to the program note, the piece was supposed to depict \\"the fear of the natural aging process\\" and the recorded text included \\"vulgar, male conversation, the kind that occurs when men are alone with each other and no women are present.\\" Anyone unfamiliar with Spanish had to take the relation between text and choreography on faith.   Ms. Lechay, who spoke in English at the Bessie Schonberg, can perform \\"Affamee\\" in either English or French in Canada. Other choreographers who use texts may find it advisable to prepare multilingual versions of their own works. And all dancers should take care to make sure that their actions invariably speak as loudly as their words.

On the other hand, I stand confident in my assertion that it is the first whose hero is an accordion. To be more accurate, there is a man attached to the device: Pietro Deiro, an Italian immigrant who earlier in this century served as a pioneer of the new piano accordion (a right-hand keyboard replacing the customary buttons) and who has been a patron saint for accordionists ever since.   A two-person team at Anahid Sofian Studio on Saturday night negotiated the studio's small, rectangular dance space, using music, dance, narration, chanting and singing to sketch Deiro's life and musical investigations. William Schimmel was the perambulating accordionist, playing his own music and Deiro's in a headlong, highly emotional virtuoso style. His cooler counterpart was Micki Goodman, whose dancing, movement and manipulation of basic props created a kind of surreal storytelling of its own. The two did it all: as performers, producers, stage managers, even as their own lighting technicians.

The Andersen indictment effectively put the firm out of business (even though the Supreme Court later overturned its conviction), costing thousands of jobs and shrinking the number of major accounting firms to four from five. Without question, the same fate would await KPMG were it to be prosecuted","excerpt":"accounting firms simply cannot withstand an indictment. Can anyone say ''The Big Three?''     If you've been following the KPMG story, you know two things. First, its actions were truly reprehensible. A 2003 investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations leaves no ambiguity: the firm absolutely knew the shelters it was devising would probably not pass muster with the Internal Revenue Service, but sold them anyway. Everything about these products and the way they were marketed was sleazy. The smallest of the Big Four, KPMG used them to bolster revenue -- they are said to have generated $124 million in fees for the firm -- and the executives involved were rising stars. In the Enron debacle, Andersen's fundamental sin was spinelessness; its auditors weren't willing to stand up to a high-paying client determined to bend (and break) accounting rules to post fictitious profits.

The very best commercial banks, when they are acquired, sell for 2.5 times book value. Why then is Anchor Bancorp, which just a few years ago was on the brink of failure, selling for $14.50 a share, nearly three times its tangible book value of $4.98? This has perplexed the savings bank's chief executive, James M. Large Jr., who has seen the stock run up from less than $1 two years ago.    The answer is that investors are looking at Anchor's earnings rather than book value. Anchor earned $1.85 a share in the last four quarters for a price-earnings multiple of 7.8, which is about average for healthy savings institutions. And investors have become confident that the bank, under Mr. Large, has put its problems behind it so that the earnings will continue to grow.

Or why, if unemployment has fallen, 1.9 million jobs have been created in the last two-and-a-half years and the economy is starting to look like a rosy-fingered dawn, consumer confidence is hunkered down lower than an economist's navel.    The fault, according to Greg Tarpinian, is not in our moods but our numbers. Or in at least one number, unemployment, the principal measure of the state of the labor market. Mr. Tarpinian, executive director of the Labor Research Association in New York, contends that the unemployment figures released monthly by the Government don't tell the full story of the current wistful relationship between Americans and employment.
