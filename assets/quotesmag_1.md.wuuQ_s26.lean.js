BEST SHOWING Second round in 1990 FIRST ROUND Romania, June 18 in Pasadena, Calif","excerpt":"United States, June 22 in Pasadena; Switzerland, June 26 in Stanford, Calif. COACH Francisco (Pacho) Maturana, a dentist by profession, has transformed Colombia into one of the most entertaining sides in international soccer. A former player of the year in the Colombian domestic league, he coaches America de Cali, the team he guided to the 1992 Colombian title. STYLE One-touch passing, always attacking. TOP PLAYERS Forward Faustino Asprilla, forward Adolfo Valencia, midfielder Carlos Valderrama, midfielder Fredy Rincon, goalie Oscar Cordoba. OUTLOOK A darkhorse candidate to win the World Cup. Colombia thrashed Argentina, 5-0, in Buenos Aires during qualifying. Before losing to Bolivia, 1-0, in an exhibition in mid-April, Colombia had run its string of unbeaten games to 28. Valderrama injured a knee in February, and while his World Cup availability was initially uncertain, he has resumed playing impressively. Much will depend on how his knee holds up, for his passes are the soil from which so many goals flower. Flamboyant goalkeeper Rene Higuita, jailed last summer for accepting $50,000 to help arrange the release of a kidnap victim, was left off the team, but Cordoba has been a solid replacement, even if he doesn't stray from the goal mouth as far and as often as Higuita did. Asprilla is a spectacular player who punctuates his goals with a backflip. He is apparently a much better soccer player than a driver, given his penchant for auto accidents. He once left his car parked in an intersection for two days before retrieving it. Another time, he received nearly three dozen stitches in his leg after reportedly kicking in the window of a bus after a confrontation with the driver. Valencia helped Bayern Munich to Germany's Bundesliga title this season. Romania CUP APPEARANCES Five (1930, 1934, 1938, 1970, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (lost to Ireland on penalty kicks in second round) BEST SHOWING Second round in 1990 FIRST ROUND Colombia, June 18 in Pasadena, Calif.; Switzerland, June 22 in Pontiac, Mich.; U.S.A., June 26 in Pasadena. COACH After a 5-2 loss during qualifying to the Representation of Czechs and Slovaks, Cornel Dinu was replaced by Anghel Iordanescu. Iordanescu had been coach of Steaua Bucharest, the army-supported team formerly run by the family of the executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. STYLE Latin, combination passing, flair for the spectacular. TOP PLAYERS Midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, forward Ilie Dumitrescu, forward Florin Raducioiu, defender Gheorghe Popescu, defender Miodrag Belodedici. OUTLOOK Since the fall of Ceausescu, many of Romania's top players have become seasoned in Western European leagues. The fulcrum of the team is the tempestuous Hagi, the \\"Maradona of the Carpathians,\\" who has a temper to match his scoring ability. He recently served a two-game suspension for spitting at a player from Northern Island during an exhibition. If Hagi maintains his composure, this team could surprise a lot of people, advancing to the quarterfinals or beyond.The Romanians are concerned about their cross-country travel requirements during the eight-day first round. They played the United States twice recently, tying, 1-1, in 1993 and winning, 2-1, earlier this year. Dumitrescu scored all three goals for the Romanians. Iordanescu does not believe that this team possesses the individual talent of the 1990 World Cup team. The coach is especially concerned that Raducioiu, his one true striker, played sparingly this season with AC Milan. Romania can't afford to have a rusty trigger finger; Raducioiu scored seven goals in five World Cup qualifying matches. This team could give the Americans fits on the counterattack. Switzerland CUP APPEARANCES Six (1934, 1938, 1950, 1954, 1962, 1966) LAST CUP 1966 BEST SHOWING Quarterfinals, 1934 and 1938 FIRST ROUND United States, June 18 in Pontiac, Mich.; Romania, June 22 in Pontiac; Colombia, June 26 in Stanford, Calif. COACH Roy Hodgson, a Brit, took over a floundering national team and qualified the Swiss for the World Cup finals for the first time since 1966 with a victory and a tie against Italy. A charming man, Hodgson took a public relations beating for instituting a teamwide sex ban. Later, he said the celibacy requirement never existed; however wives and girlfriends will stay at a different hotel from the players and will be allowed to visit only after two of the three first-round games. Hodgson said he was less concerned about sex than he was about finding a place that will permit him to light up a cigar in the anti-smoking United States. As a player, Hodgson completed his career in South Africa, then spent more than a decade coaching in Sweden. He then moved to the Swiss club Neuchatel Xamax and in 1992, swapped jobs with Uli Stielike, a German who had become unnerved by the complacency of the national team in defeat. STYLE A 4-4-2 formation that combines individualism of Italian influence with resourcefulness and tight midfield of German approach. TOP PLAYERS Forwards Stephane Chapuisat and Adrian Knup, midfielders Ciraco Sforza, Georges Bregy and Alain Sutter, sweeper Alain Geiger. OUTLOOK None of the Swiss players have World Cup experience, the country's last appearance being 28 years ago. The opener against the Americans, to be played indoors at the Silverdome, in a humid, sticky environment before a pro-U.S.A. crowd, is critical. But Chapuisat and Knup have honed their scoring skills in Germany's Bundesliga. This season Chapuisat scored 16 goals for Borussia Dortmund, and he has a skill that many Americans lack: the ability to finish a play. Knup has scored 21 times in 31 appearances with the national team. Sforza and Bregy are the point guards in midfield, distributing the ball. Goalie Marco Pascolo suffered a knee injury three weeks before the start of the World Cup. At the World Cup draw in December in Las Vegas, Nev., Hodgson said that if his team played a mere 5 percent below its capability, it would not advance beyond the first round. United States CUP APPEARANCES Four (1930, 1934, 1950, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (0-3) BEST SHOWING Semifinals in 1930 FIRST ROUND Switzerland, June 18 in Pontiac, Mich.; Colombia, June 22 in Pasadena, Calif.; Romania, June 26, in Pasadena COACH Known as the Miracle Worker, Bora Milutinovic coached Mexico to the quarterfinals in 1986 and Costa Rica to the second round in 1990. An eccentric coach, he is famous for his shrewd evasiveness.  STYLE Latin, lateral passing, control, possession game. TOP PLAYERS Midfielder Tab Ramos, midfielder Thomas Dooley, midfielder John Harkes, forward Ernie Stewart, forward Eric Wynalda, striker Roy Wegerle, goalkeeper Tony Meola. OUTLOOK If the foreign-based players can be assimilated in time, the United States can avoid becoming the first host country not to advance to the second round. Much depends on the first game against Switzerland. At least the Silverdome audience will be supportive, which may not be the case against Colombia and Romania at the Rose Bowl. A 1-0 victory over Mexico in the final exhibition was a confidence booster, especially since the crowd of 91,123 -- the largest ever to see the United States team play in this country -- was overwhelmingly pro-Mexico. But there are still kinks to be worked out. The United States built a modest 2-2-7 exhibition record against World Cup finalists, struggling to score goals and lapsing frequently on defense. The defense appeared much more cohesive against Mexico with Dooley playing at sweeper in place of Marcelo Balboa, who has not been the same since undergoing knee surgery in April 1993. Milutinovic has plenty of decisions to make: Start Stewart at striker, or opt for Frank Klopas, who has scored seven goals in his last nine games? Start Wynalda, or let him continue to kick-start the attack off the bench? Milutinovic must also find a place for John Harkes, who did not arrive until early June from the English League.

The car will shoot up 10 feet, in an imitation of Michael J. Fox's character blasting off into space.    The Screen Test Home Video Adventure, the Streetbusters show and the Blues Brothers show opened last month. The Screen Test Adventure allows visitors to act as a movie star for a day and then leave with a videocassette of their performance. The Screen Test, which costs $31.75, including tax, is the only show not included in the general admission price. Streetbusters features the action of two popular films, \\"Ghostbusters\\" and \\"Beetlejuice.\\" Travel Advisory","excerpt":"Universal Adds 3 Shows in Florida"},{"year":"1939","title":"HOLLYWOOD, Calif., Oct. 30-- The supporting cast for Universal's W.C.

We have always said that if producers would just forget Indians and buffalos for awhile and concentrate on something modern like divorcees, they could stop worrying about Movie Quiz contests, Bingo and giveaways of that nature. And a picture like \\"The Road ot Reno,\\" at the Globe, in which the sombreros are secondary to the business at hand—call it romance, sex, or whatever you will—goes far toward corroborating our thesis.Besides being an amusingly indoors slant on the Great Outdoors, \\"The Road to Reno\\" is distinguished by the presence in its cast of a former star of silent films, who not only can talk—and fascinate both Randolph Scott and Alan Marshal in the process—but who sings: we refer to Miss Hope Hampton. The story is that Hope (who is Spring eternal) goes out to Nevada for a divorce and then decides that she loves her first—or was it her second?—husband. It's that thin, but there is a certain, as we said before, slant in the way it is told.For instance, when Randolph, Hope's Western incumbent, tries to win her back by showing up Alan, her Eastern suitor, Alan is up before he is, as fresh as a daisy, outswims him in the icy lake, sticks on the \\"outlaw\\" horse the boys had saddled for him as long as any, ??? buster could. And still Hope decides to stick with Randolph. In addition to the novel script (obviously indebted to that famous Reno scene in \\"The Women\\") and Miss Hampton's winsome warnings, the direction, by S. Sylvan Simon—who would rather meet a technical problem than a pieman— is worthy of mention.
