They did it quickly and quietly, taping boxes, discarding old mail, gathering belongings and then leaving for the last time.   One day after the end of the World Series, the Oakland Athletics were still somewhat disbelieving. But the sweep by the Cincinnati Reds was over now. It was time to move on.   \\"Most of the regrets you have were felt last night,\\" said the A's relief pitcher Rick Honeycutt. \\"It's not the way you wanted it to end. But today, it's back to reality. You go home, get the kids in school and try enjoying the winter.\\"   For many, it will not be easy. The Athletics had won 103 games during the season, squashed the Boston Red Sox in the American League playoff and were favored to beat the Reds and lay claim to their second straight World Series victory.   When it did not come, it made the loss difficult to accept. In the end, Tony La Russa, the A's manager, spent most of today practicing damage control, than congratulating the Reds. Canseco's Wife Angry     There were some leftover issues:   Esther Canseco, the wife of the A's outfielder Jose Canseco, was critical of La Russa for benching her husband at the start of Game 4.   \\"He's a punk,\\" she told The San Jose Mercury News before Saturday's game. \\"Let them sweep us. I should have worn a red dress. Tony's going too far. He's putting all the blame on Jose when it's the whole team.\\"   Rob Dibble, the Cincinnati reliever, accused Dave Stewart, the A's starting pitcher, of deliberating throwing at Billy Hatcher in the first inning Saturday, calling it an American League tactic. Hatcher was forced to leave when he was hit by a pitch on the top of his left hand. X-rays showed no fracture.   After the game, Stewart insisted the A's were still the best team in baseball, a remark that prompted the Reds' manager, Lou Piniella, to cry \\"sour grapes.\\" Reply From LaRussa     In his office today, La Russa tidied things up and tried to straighten out the mess that had occurred the night before.   Asked his feelings about the remarks made by Esther Canseco, he answered, \\"I'd rather not say, except that in importance to this club, it was the slightest shade above zero.\\"   Of Dibble, he was even more emphatic.   \\"If he'd check with his teammates and his manager,\\" La Russa said, \\"he'd find out that the pitch was inside and Hatcher dove for it. It happened in the first inning. Stew is not going to give them a run.   \\"When he shouts that they've got the best team, he has every right. But when it goes beyond that, it's ridiculous.\\"    La Russa had no problem with Stewart's post-game declaration about the A's, although he saw Piniella's point, too.   \\"If I were Lou, I'd be upset,\\" he said. \\"Cincinnati won the prize. Mostly what you should do is give them credit","excerpt":"that's my attitude. But when someone pitches his heart out and gets beat like Stew did, I can see how he would feel. He feels we've got the best team, and I give him credit for thinking that. But Cincinnati did beat us.\\"   Because of it, the A's are likely to begin a winter of moderate changes. Willie McGee and Bob Welch will become free agents, and Dave Henderson could join them this week when a decision is made regarding a collusion ruling against owners.    As La Russa delivered his parting comments, players packed in the clubhouse. Some still seemed stunned, others did not.   \\"I'm still a little bit disbelieving,\\" Mike Gallego said. \\"I was expecting to come to work today.\\"   Dave Henderson said: \\"This is wintertime. I don't care anymore. I shut it down after the season. I'm going to watch football and enjoy my family.\\"   But for La Russa it didn't seem as if it would be that easy. He still appeared hurt by the loss.   \\"People underrate how good it feels when you win,\\" he said. \\"It feels worse than you think when you lose. But I'd still rather take the chance of getting my heart broken to get to the other side.  \\"The other side feels real good.\\" Reality Sets In for Stunned A's"},{"year":"1938","title":"Corrigan, Douglas","excerpt":"That's My Story BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Emotions Omitted The Honor Guest Absent Begins Flying Career"},{"year":"1973","title":"Last week Fred Daizell Scotchtaped four short business letters to the southern wall of his dormitory living room. &#8220","excerpt":"That's my wailing wall,&#8221; said Dalzell, a senior quarterback at Princeton University.

When the man in charge of the region's mass transit outlined a plan last week to do just that, however, it was denounced for being politically infeasible.    Robert R. Kiley, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, suggested that only by removing Civil Service and union protection from transit supervisors would service improve significantly. ''We cannot afford to have managers perpetually insulated from the consequences of poor performance,'' Mr. Kiley said. Of the 49,000 employees of the Transit Authority, the M.T.A. subsidiary that runs the subways and buses, no more than 300 supervisors are union- and Civil Service-exempt and could be discharged at the will of the authority's president.

Yet for anyone even marginally interested in Mr. Dylan—and for anyone willing to accept the idea that his evasiveness, however exasperating, is a crucial aspect of his finest work — \\"Renaldo and Clara\\" holds the attention at least as effectively as it tries the patience.No knowledge of Mr. Dylan or his history is supposed to be central to an understanding of the film, but it nevertheless trades heavily upon his past. The singer David Blue, playing himself, talks about the artistic climate of Greenwich Village when Mr. Dylan first arrived there, and Joan Baez is rather coyly cast as Mr. Dylan's former lover. Mr. Dylan, even more coyly, is cast as someone other than himself, a very vague figure named Renaldo.As an actor, Mr. Dylan specializes in giving the simultaneous impressions that he isn't really interested in acting, and that he is always acting anyway. Renaldo is thus virtually useless as a character, but his alleged presence in the film does help call attention to Mr. Dylan's obsessive camouflaging of his feelings, a tendency that produces the film's only intelligible conceit. There are only two central characters in the film, a man and a woman, yet their identities are splintered and then parceled out to a dozen different actors.The woman is most frequently played by Sara Dylan, who is now Mr. Dylan's ex-wife, but aspects of her can also be seen in Miss Baez, Ronee Blakley and Helena Kallianiotes. Mr. Dylan, Ronnie Hawkins and Rob Stoner are among the actors who stand in for the man. The two lovers, apparently about to become ex-lovers, are irremediably locked in battle, but the device of fluctuating identities prevents them from ever confronting each other face to face.This technique, not unlike one used by Robert Altman in \\"Images,\\" is potentially an intriguing one, but Mr. Dylan's love of mystery prevails over his exhibitionism, with disappointing results. Most of the actors here seem to be playing either Mr. or Mrs. Dylan, and all of them slavishly do the director's bidding. But Mr. Dylan's instructiveness, to his actors and to his audience, is incomplete. \\"Renaldo and Clara\\" is so personal it borders on being obscure, yet it remains surprisingly deficient in personality. The figure who dominates the film is a man in hiding.Mr. Dylan has always been elusive","excerpt":"that's no mean part of his charm. But his best work, like the \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" album released a couple of years ago, has derived its momentum from alternating currents of passion and restraint, from conflicting impulses to repress and to reveal. \\"Renaldo and Clara\\" addresses this apparent contradiction so passively, even cold-bloodedly, that it seldom has the urgency it needs. The film is full of connections to be made and riddles to be solved, but it approaches these things so dispassionately that the viewer has little choice but to follow suit.Even though Mr. Dylan makes it clear that he in no way wanted to make a concert film, the footage of him in performance provides not only the film's most electrifying moments but also its most emblematic ones. On the Rolling Thunder tour, Mr. Dylan performed in whiteface, and he is photographed here in tight closeup, singing so ferociously that his sweat melts the makeup; the film's sense of a person at war with a mask is never more riveting than when the camera studies Mr. Dylan's face as he sings. Every detail of these shots is resonant, from the fiery look in Mr. Dylan's eyes to the fresh flowers that someone has apparently been hired to tuck into his hatbrim, just before each show.The film contains more than its share of dead weight, but it is seldom genuinely dull. On the credit side, there are a great many isolated images that have an independent vitality, from the sight of Joan Baez, looking unexpectedly dreamy in a white gown, to the spectacle of Allen Ginsberg, introduced as \\"without a doubt a very interesting and clever personality,\\" reading his poetry to a bewildered band of middle-aged ladies.It's a pity that the editing of the film, which is credited to Mr. Dylan and Howard Alk, pays so little heed to consistency. Following a pattern of linear thought is clearly not one of the film's concerns, but maintaining a constant degree of intensity should have been; this way, by carelessly commingling very complex and suggestive episodes with very flat and simple ones, the editing continually throws an already befuddled viewer even further off balance. Interludes like the culminating meeting of Mr. Dylan, Mrs. Dylan and Miss Baez, at once quite rarefied and in an atmosphere that is amusingly mundane, and an exceedingly one-note segment devoted to Hurricane Carter, are so incompatible that they simply don't belong in the same movie.

Jazz and rock bands, and any group that doesn't depend on written music, agree on what to play in a cooperative process that changes from song to song. And even a solo performer has to consider who will be listening.    A style can speak to and for a community of musicians and fans, rallying them around a song or a beat. It can also keep outsiders at a distance that is enforced by language barriers, questions of taste (try explaining reggae to bluegrass fans) and class and racial differences. In New York, all kinds of musical communities exist side by side, as close but as separate as the radio stations that jostle each other on the AM and FM bands. And while musicians often rail against being pigeonholed, it takes a determined effort to knock down stylistic boundaries. One problem is finding musicians who are ready to collaborate in a new way; the other is creating something new for them to play - and play with - together.

Who wasn't on it? Why? Where were they?    The telephone rang, Boeheim excused himself and took the call. It was someone informing the 47-year-old coach of the latest episode in his mini-feud with Dick Vitale, the broadcaster, which began when Vitale speculated on national television that Boeheim's job could be in jeopardy.    Vitale had been quoted as saying: \\"I'm afraid that given the poor off-court record of Syracuse's players and the current reform movement in the N.C.A.A., Syracuse administrators might have to give in and ask Jim Boeheim to resign as coach when the investigation is over.\\" 'Irresponsible Behavior'     Boeheim had been incensed. He called ABC, which employes Vitale, and suggested, among other things, that Vitale be dismissed for making the remarks, which Boeheim regarded as inappropriate.    The caller was informing Boeheim that Vitale was now angry. Boeheim shrugged. \\"That's the most irresponsible behavior that somebody who's supposed to be in the media can possibly do,\\" he said, alluding to Vitale. \\"Talking about the kids, the games, who's going to get in","excerpt":"that's one thing. Even who isn't doing a great coaching job, or who is. That's O.K.    \\"But when you start speculating about people's jobs I think you've gone over the line.\\" Pressure on the Coach     Allegations over misdeeds in the basketball program surfaced in The Syracuse Post-Standard in December, and then two weeks ago seven Syracuse players were suspended by the university and then reinstated by the National Collegiate Athletic Association hours later. As a result, Boeheim, whose Orangemen play St. John's (17-6, 8-6) at Madison Square Garden tonight, is feeling more pressure than he has in his 15 seasons as a head coach.    \\"The only thing I can say is that these are difficult times,\\" Boeheim said. \\"Obviously, there's nothing easy about what we're going through.\\"    Asked about his personal feelings, he added: \\"When you've been some place 28 years and when you take into consideration what this place means to me, I don't think that should leave any doubt about what my feelings are. There should be no question.\\" Making the Team as Walk-On     Boeheim, who came to Syracuse in 1962, made the basketball team as a walk-on. After his college career, he spent four years in the Eastern League, then returned to Syracuse in 1969 as a graduate assistant. He was promoted to assistant in 1972 and succeeded Roy Danforth as the head coach in 1976. Syracuse has never had a losing season under Boeheim and has enjoyed eight consecutive 20-plus victory seasons. Syracuse has led the nation in attendance for the last five seasons.   This year's team has exceeded all expectations. Syracuse (23-3, 9-3) which was picked to finish third in the Big East, comes into the Garden ranked fifth in both news-agency polls.     Unfortunately for Boeheim, the team's success has been overshadowed by an internal investigation being conducted by two law firms and monitored by a faculty oversight committee. The negative publicity has embittered a number of Syracuse players and has forced Boeheim, perhaps for the first time in his career, to balance his sharp-tongued, hard-core coaching tactics with compassion in order to keep his team settled. More Aware of the Players     \\"When you get into difficult times you have to be more aware of your players' thoughts, what they're thinking, how they're acting,\\" he said. \\"You have to be very concerned about that.\\"    Boeheim rejected the notion that the controversy surrounding the program had brought the team together.    \\"This team was exhibiting these things in practice in the fall,\\" he said. \\"They were playing together; they were doing good things. I just think this team has a little better outside game, we've got the two ball-handlers instead of one. We're not a powerful team, we're not as physical, we don't run as well, but we've got a nice solid balance to our team.\\" A Sharper Edge     There also seems to be a sharper edge, perhaps a deeper commitment and a greater capacity to focus. Boeheim said those factors might be attributable to the controversy.    \\"I've been trying to get them to concentrate and do the very best they can now because you can't get this season back,\\" Boeheim said. \\"This summer, this investigation will have been completed and whatever happens happens. The season's over. You can't then say 'Well, now we can concentrate on playing.' You can't do that.    \\"When I get done with every season I want to look back and say I did the best coaching job I could do. If that means bottling things up and putting things away, that's what I'll have to do. I'm going to help this team get through and be as successful as it can be, because we can never reclaim it.\\" Boeheim Wards Off Critics From All Corners"},{"year":"1953","title":"NYS Youth Comm conducts state-wide drive to divert children's celebration from destructive activities HALLOWEEN MENU: CIDER AND SINKERS","excerpt":"That's One Way to Keep Small Fry Out of Mischief, State Youth Board Tells Adults"},{"year":"1921","title":"MR.

The coupon fight is another front in the war between Robert Maxwell, the British publisher who owns The Daily News, and Rupert Murdoch. The two have competing newspapers in London, and Mr. Maxwell has started a new horse-racing paper, The Racing Times, to compete with The Daily Racing Form, which was until recently controlled by Mr. Murdoch.    Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation also owns Quad Marketing Inc. and Product Movers Inc., two of the three companies that produce the coupon booklets in many Sunday newspapers.     Coupons are an important source of revenue for papers and attract readers. But all three coupon companies stopped placing coupons in The Daily News when its Sunday circulation fell sharply from 1.1 million in the five-month strike that ended in March, when Mr. Maxwell bought the paper.   The Daily News immediately started trying to woo advertisers back by guaranteeing that its audited Sunday circulation would average at least a million for the six months ending in September. A News spokesman said the paper was \\"on target,\\" but declined to give numbers.   Thus far, however, none of the coupon booklets have returned to The Daily News, although they do appear Newsday and The New York Times.   Les Goodstein, vice president of advertising at The News, said the non-Murdoch coupon company, Valassis Inserts Inc., would begin placing its coupons in The News by mid-July. David A. Brandon, president of Valas sis, said a deal with The News was close, but not yet complete.    Should Valassis coupons return toThe Daily News, the other two coupon companies may be under greater pressure from package-goods companies to go back as well.    But Ken Bortner, president of Mr. Murdoch's News America Publishing, said its coupon booklets would not return to The News unless the rates came down drastically.   \\"If our coupons are to be used to build circulation, we should have an incentive to go back,\\" he said. \\"If we just help Mr. Maxwell and not Mr. Murdoch, what's the point?\\"   At The Daily News, there is suspicion that the absence of the coupon books is not based on economics.   \\"Murdoch just does not want to do business with Maxwell","excerpt":"that's the end of the story,\\" said a News executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.   But Mr. Goodstein said he remained \\"confident that at some point we'll get the business back.\\"   And Mr. Bortner said, \\"Given the right structure and right terms, something could be worked out.\\" Editorial Feud Continues    For 15 years, readers of the editorial pages in Shreveport, La., have been able to choose between the conservative voice of The Times of Shreveport and the outspoken liberalism of The Shreveport Journal.   The Journal ceased publication in April, but its prickly editorial page has survived and appears Monday through Friday side-by-side with The Times's editorial page. On Saturday, The Times's op-ed page separates the feuding views, and Sunday belongs to The Times exclusively because The Journal did not publish on Sunday.   \\"As far as I know, this is unique,\\" said Charles T. Beaird, the 68-year-old Shreveport native who has the right to express his liberal views in The Times until 2000.   Starting in 1953, The Times, owned by the Gannett Company, and The Journal were published in a joint operating arrangement in which they merged production, business and delivery operations and split the profits.   The Journal, the afternoon paper, lost money, so the much-larger Times said the arrangement would not be renewed when it expired in 1994. But The Journal owned the rights to the paper's press, a complication.   The compromise was to close The Shreveport Journal but continue the editorial page. And Mr. Beaird's family will also receive The Journal's roughly 20 percent share of The Times's profits until 1994. Latest Bout for Trump    When it comes to negative press coverage, Donald J. Trump usually attacks. So the New York developer recently declared war on a Wall Street Journal reporter.   Norman Pearlstine, the executive editor, acknowledges that his reporter might have used better judgment -- and has second thoughts about a time when he accepted Mr. Trump's expensive hospitality.    But he expressed full confidence in Neil Barsky, who has been covering Mr. Trump for The Wall Street Journal since 1989, and said Mr. Barsky would continue on the Trump beat and would not be reprimanded.   On May 31, The Journal published an article by Mr. Barsky that said Mr. Trump's finances were was so strained that the developer might have to borrow money from his father.    Mr. Trump denounced the article as untrue and charged that Mr.  Barsky had asked for free tickets to the Holyfield-Foreman fight, staged by Mr.  Trump in Atlantic City on April 19.    Mr. Pearlstine said Mr. Trump told him that Mr.  Barsky had been given three $1,000 tickets and then asked for two more tickets and a hotel suite, which were refused. Mr. Trump charged that Mr. Barsky was retaliating with his article.   Mr. Pearlstine said what happened was quite different. He said a Trump official offered a ticket to Mr. Barsky. The Journal's policy generally prohibits accepting gifts. Mr. Barsky asked Fred R. Bleakley, the news editor, whether he should accept.   Mr. Barsky wanted to go to the fight to gain access to top Trump executives. Mr. Bleakley did not express strong opposition, which he now regards as his mistake.   Mr. Barsky accepted the ticket, was invited to take two and agreed, so his brother could go. He paid $100 for a third ticket for his father, but when he went to pick up the two free tickets, he was offered a third $1,000 ticket for his father. He accepted.   But The Journal says there were no requests for two additional tickets or a free hotel suite.   Mr. Barsky said he probably should have refused the tickets. \\"I made a mistake, and it's a beaut,\\" he said.    And Mr. Pearlstine said, \\"The fact that Donald chose to call and complain a month after the event rather than at the time suggests that he was seeking favorable coverage and is upset he didn't get it.\\"    Mr. Pearlstine said he might have erred when he accepted Mr. Trump's invitation in 1988 to a helicopter ride to Atlantic City and free tickets for the Tyson-Holmes fight. He said he reasoned that the trip would enable him to meet valuable news sources. \\"If he offered the tickets today, I would not accept them,\\" he said.   Mr. Trump said he was \\"strongly considering major legal action\\" against The Journal and Mr. Barsky.    But Mr. Pearlstine was skeptical that such a suit would ever be filed. He said The Journal had sent $3,000 to Mr. Trump for the tickets.

The biggest declines were at US Airways, down 49.6 percent, and United Airlines, down 42.4 percent, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics at the Transportation Department. But the jobs picture was much brighter at the seven top low-cost carriers, which had a net gain in workers of 12.5 percent in April of this year (71,000) compared with April 2001 (59,600). It was better still at the regional carriers, which had 14.4 percent more employees in April (56,600) than in April 2001 (30,500).    FARES KEEP INCHING UP -- With the price of oil topping $60 yesterday, the latest fare increases appeared to be sticking.

But last week I returned from an overseas trip to find that Mr. Dole was proposing to repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, and I've changed my mind about the old guy. Yes, sir, scrapping the gasoline tax. That's the sort of leadership America needs","excerpt":"that's the sort of spirit of sacrifice the country's been missing: a President who's ready to sacrifice the budget, to sacrifice the environment, to sacrifice energy conservation, to sacrifice oil reserves in order to save the American people 4.3 cents a gallon. And when Mr. Dole's sidekick Dick Armey, the House majority leader, suggested that we consider cutting the education budget to make up for the lost gas-tax revenue, well, then and there I knew I was a Dole man. I mean, cutting education to save  Americans a few pennies a gallon at a time when their gas is already the cheapest in the world -- that's the kind of thinking that will keep us the world's most competitive nation in the 21st century. I sure hope the Japanese don't get that idea.         Are we out of our minds? Raising the gas tax has been one of the few smart things we've done in recent years. It promotes energy conservation, it helps protect the air, it encourages development of alternative energies, it promotes  national security by reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies -- and it  reduces the budget deficit. That 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax raises $5 billion a year. It is one of the reasons the deficit has been cut in half since 1993.

The premise calls for stable, married, well-heeled Giulio (Mr. Mastroianni) to become smitten with the beautiful Francesca (Miss Kinski), though he knows she's young enough to be his daughter. What he doesn't know, until after they become involved, is that she may very well be his daughter, since her mother was someone he loved and forgot about, just the right number of years ago.Giulio worries about this, of course. What makes the film somewhat novel, or at least modern, is that the intimations of incest don't bother Francesca in the slightest. She likes older men, she explains","excerpt":"that's why she has posters of Hemingway and Einstein on the bedroom wall.And she likes Giulio. And even if he is her father, biologically speaking, he didn't raise her and he hardly knows her and she doesn't have any strong feelings about him one way or the other. She shrugs. Giulio worries. They eventually resolve their differences, but the problem is more engaging than its solution.Mr. Mastroianni attacks his role earnestly, affecting a middle-aged fussiness and seeming genuinely troubled, even torn. He has some excellent moments with a wife and daughter — she is about Francesca's age, and almost as promiscuous — that help supply the film with a broader sense of family relationships, and of the differing mores of different generations.Much of this information is presented and then ignored, but Mr. Mastroianni gives Giulio as much depth as the material will allow. There are hints throughout \\"Stay as You Are,\\" which was directed by Alberto Lattuada, of the much more memorable movie this might have become.Miss Kinski, who is really the daughter of the German actor Klaus Kinski, looks very little like her father and a lot like the very young, very beautiful Ingrid Bergman. The resemblance is strictly facial and it doesn't go more than skin-deep, perhaps because Miss Kinski's manner and bearing are so much less remarkable than her appearance. She makes a convincingly coltish teen-ager, which is really all this role demands. But she's more captivating to look at than to listen to, and her Francesca eventually becomes terribly whiny, even dull.\\"Stay as You Are,\\" which opens today at the Beekman, is dangerously smarmy at times — dangerous because its cheapness undermines Mr. Mastroianni's essentially serious performance, which is the backbone of the movie. The film works best when the story seems to generate its sexual encounters spontaneously. But there are too many times when the plot looks like a pretext for stringing together amorous interludes.

CHRONICLE"},{"year":"1995","title":"A month ago, just after this nation's hyperactive oddsmakers gloomily estimated the chances of a reincarnated Fred Perry turning up in time to win Wimbledon at 1,000-to-1, a turncoat dressed in white and carrying a smoking racquet arrived on the scene. Not since Perry's victory in 1936 has a British man won this coveted singles championship, but as soon as a towering 21-year-old Canadian with the 137 mile-an-hour serve and a ranking of 60th jumped across the Atlantic, the odds on a Briton dropped to a manageable 50-1.   On Monday, with all 13,000 of the Center Court's spectators poised to adopt his cause the way he has adopted their country, Greg Rusedski will try to justify his sudden celebrity, and the epic amount of pressure that accompanies it, with a fourth-round upset of Pete Sampras, Wimbledon's two-time defending champion.    Helped along by his English mother, Helen, but sought after primarily because he owns the world's fastest serve, the hired gun was promptly installed as the British No. 1. The snub to the nation's incumbents caused at least one British player to quit the country's Davis Cup squad, and Rusedski's first-round losses at Nottingham and Queen's Club in his first two events as a Briton seemed to suggest the controversial conversion might have been a flop.    But now 77 aces and three rounds deep into Wimbledon, a frontier no other British player has crossed this year in singles, Rusedski has stolen the scene if not the hearts of his fellow players.   Andre Agassi has sneered about Rusedski's new way with the British vernacular: they don't use words like \\"telly,\\" \\"blokes\\" and \\"brilliant\\" back in Montreal, a city where Rusedski claims to have spent 16 formative years without learning how to play hockey. He was, he said, escorted directly onto a tennis court by his father, who dreamed that his 7-year-old son might one day do what he could not: take on Ivan Lendl.   Instead, Rusedski is taking on the No. 2 player in the world, the player whose game and accomplishments epitomize what he aspires to. Although Rusedski may have fired the world's fastest serve, it is Sampras who has been immortalized in the act of serving on Wimbledon T-shirts.   Doubtless Rusedski will not be receiving any further tennis lessons from Sampras, who claimed not to remember the results of a two-set practice session they had back in Tampa, Fla., in the days when Rusedski was just a 117th-ranked Canadian prospect and not the venerated British No. 1.   \\"I don't remember a lot of my practice matches","excerpt":"that's why they're practice,\\" he sniped after being told that the gregarious Rusedski recalled splitting sets with Sampras, who at the time was ranked No. 1.   This weekend, Sampras expressed reluctance to give up his practice court to \\"a British player,\\" as Wimbledon protocol requires that the top British player gets solo court time upon request, once he saw that the player in the wings was Rusedski. Sampras also said that regardless of what any radar gun decrees, he believes Goran Ivanisevic's serve is superior to Rusedski's.   Sampras said he found it ironic that Wimbledon, in retaliation against the rally-less final he and Ivanisevic played here last year, selected this year to debut softer, slower balls in the hope of reducing aces and enhancing rallies -- obviously a decision arrived at before Rusedski arrived to save the day.   \\"Maybe next year they'll use golf balls,\\" Sampras said.   Sampras added: \\"There's not a whole lot of strategy involved when you play someone like him. He's got a big serve, he's lefty, and whenever you get those two things on grass it's going to be a tough match. And he's obviously filled with a lot of emotion. Hopefully I can get off to a good start and put him out of the match.\\" Sampras apparently didn't notice that the same strategy failed miserably for 16th-seeded Guy Forget against Rusedski in the second round.   Rusedski admitted that his own game will need to be perfect if he expects to give the defending champion significant trouble.   Rusedski, whose only previous Wimbledon experience was a second-round loss last year, needed all 36 aces he launched in his 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) escape from the clutches of Olivier Delaitre of France in the third round.   \\"I will really have to serve well if I'm going to do well against Pete, so I'm not going to go out on a limb and make predictions,\\" said Rusedski, who currently lives in Surrey with the family of his girlfriend, Lucy Connor. He met her four years ago when she was a ball girl for one of his matches.   Meantime, Wimbledon is keeping its grass short, the better to create a sympathetic environment for the bullets of its hired gun -- a tactic that, unfortunately for the home country's hopes, also plays right into the hands of Sampras and the other big servers in the Round of 16, the fourth-seeded Ivanisevic and third-seeded Boris Becker.   Still, the mood is jubilant for this eager transplant who insists he \\"feels British.\\"   \\"This is why I came over here,\\" he said. \\"I love the country. I feel British completely.\\"   That's something Sampras, Agassi, and Ivanisevic, and not even the citizen-of-the-world Becker, will ever say.

After amassing evidence that they were looted, Italian investigators began seeking a handover of the acroliths — statues usually made with wooden torsos but with stone heads and extremities — in the late 1980s.

In 2002 Mr. Bondioli Osio, Mr. Tempelsman and the University of Virginia worked out a deal under which Mr. Tempelsman would give the university partial ownership of the statues for five years and then cede them entirely. On Jan. 1 the acroliths — their wooden bodies long ago lost, leaving two heads, three hands and three feet — became the property of the university, which promptly returned them to Italy. The statues, one of which is shown above, arrived in Rome on Friday along with nine classical antiquities from the private collection of the New York philanthropist Shelby White that were ceded to Italy in January under a separate pact.

Three opinion polls have indicated that public opinion was heavily against her decision, with roughly two-thirds of those questioned opposing British support for the raid.   Political commentators in both The Times of London and The Spectator, publications normally friendly to Mrs. Thatcher, raised the possibility that the outcome of the next British election may have been determined by the week's events.

Her challenger, the formidable ex-Defense Minister Michael Heseltine, says he has the support of about 100 of the 372 Conservative Party members of Parliament who will choose their leader and prime minister in a secret ballot on Tuesday. To win the first round, either candidate would need at least 187 votes, with a margin of at least 56. With Mrs. Thatcher off that day with President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev burying the cold war in Paris, and 15,000 British troops facing the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf, the odds favor her to make it, and so do the bookmakers.

Fashion, customarily defined, has to do with the adornment of the body, nudity with the absence of adornment.

One explanation for this is that fashion's boundaries have gone a long way past clothes, coifs and toenail polish. As Kennedy Fraser has argued in an essay called ''The Fashionable Mind,'' which first appeared in The New Yorker in 1978, the voracious maw of fashion now grips much of literature, dance, film, art - all, in effect, that we call culture. Fashion's credo, according to Miss Fraser, ''holds that appearances are of greater significance than substance'' - a state of affairs not too difficult to perceive in the world at large.

Because of the accuracy of the playwright's perceptions, the play is far more than a case of reverse Moliere. It is a highly literate comedy of manners, with sobering undertones. The subjects are academic insularity and artistic arrogance, the assumption that words are more relevant than actions or emotions. Although the play was first presented in 1970, it seems not to have aged at all, as demonstrated in Gordon Edelstein's vibrant new production at the Long Wharf Theater.   This bourgeois comedy was originally set in the \\"near future.\\" That future is now, and also tomorrow, whenever and wherever people forcibly detach themselves from the problems of the world around them and seclude themselves in a hothouse.

There is a determined disposition to show Rommel in a most heroic light and to convey that he, von Rundstedt and certain others were morally on the \\"right side.\\"This curiously ambivalent thesis is supported, so far as the picture is concerned, by no other evidence more impressive than that of Rommel's distrust of Hitler all along and his final reluctant agreement to participate in a plot against Hitler's life—the memorable abortive bomb plot—when he felt that the Fuehrer was leading Germany to doom. In short, Rommel rates the deification that he unstintingly gets in this film, because he eventually turned against Hitler and paid for this treachery with his life.With apparent disconcern that this thesis fails to take into account that Rommel fought and killed Allies for the Fuehrer so long as he thought that Germany could win, Mr. Johnson and his associates have used all the tricks in the book to portray a military figure of great courage, generosity and humanity. Not only have they got James Mason to play the heroic role, in full knowledge that Mr. Mason is a master of the soulful, \\"misunderstood\\" type, but they have larded this portrait of the general with all the recognized attributes of \\"goodness\\" on the screen.From Mr. Young's book they have borrowed a significant incident of Rommel's \\"decency\\" toward war prisoners during the desert fighting in Africa with which to introduce their hero in the film. They have shown him as selfless, efficient and vigorous in attack, but never thoughtless of his men nor too busy to chat with a sergeant about his peaceful Alpine home. And especially, they have dwelled fondly upon his sentiments as a family man, most touchingly demonstrated toward his good wife, whom Jessica Tandy wistfully plays.Furthermore, it is oddly conspicuous that, in this high tribute to a recent foe, the \\"good\\" Germans have the speech and manners of cultivated Englishmen","excerpt":"the \\"bad\\" ones talk like American gangsters—and Hitler talks like a German low comedian. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is the perfect gentleman as the Lord Mayor of Stuttgart, who importunes Rommel to rebel; Leo G. Carroll is terse and dry as von Rundstedt, and George Macready is crisply cool as an aide. Everett Sloane is harsh and icy as the general who conveys to Rommel the ultimate suggestion of suicide, and Luther Adler portrays Hitler in the same style as he did recently in that ridiculous film, \\"The Magic Face.\\"As for the drama enacted in this picture, now at the Globe, it does not lack in the kind of interest and suspense that go with a good, high-level conspiracy yarn. Henry Hathaway has directed the principals for restraint, but tension in the performance of Mr. Johnson's script, and blazing scenes of actual warfare have been lifted from the great documentary \\"Desert Victory.\\" But, reduced to its dubious moral, \\"The Desert Fox\\" says nothing more than that a soldier is justified in committing treason when he has lost confidence in the military capacity of his commander in chief. The fact that treason is committed against Hitler is the only emotional compensation of this strange film.

That handsome polo player and actor, Jack Holt, essays the rôle of Johnny McCloud, who becomes enamored of a dark-eyed platinum blonde. His exploits in this tale are scarcely credible, but the film affords some unconscious amusement, particularly when it depicts the disappointment and anger of the strong-armed minion of the law, who more than once proves that the fist is mightier than the pistol.The moment McCloud, known by gangsters as a detective who will stand for no nonsense, sets eyes upon Lola Parker, a torch singer, he thinks of wedding bells. Lola at the time is infatuated with a good-looking crook, but, while he understands that he has a rival, McCloud announces in virtually the first sequence that the torch singer is going to be his wife.Judging by what happens here the plight of a romantically inclined sleuth is not precisely enviable. McCloud soon decides that the best way to get rid of the crook, who is known as George Perry, is to have him convicted of a crime, which turns out to be quite easy. The sleuth, however, has not counted on Lola's interference and she arranges to pave the way for Perry's escape from a train on which McCloud is escorting him to Sing Sing.After that one has a picture of McCloud's determination to get his man and also of his falling from grace from the police department because no other case interests him but the apprehension of Perry. Lola and her lover succeed in eluding McCloud by a narrow margin and boarding a steamship bound for Bermuda, where Perry acts as the bootlegging agent for a gangster chieftain named Mossie Ennis.But one surmises that sooner or later McCloud will get his man, and he does. It is even his intention to make Lola suffer the penalty of the law, although he admits his desire to make her Mrs. McCloud after she is released. The torch singer, however, eventually is paroled in the custody of McCloud and, therefore, all ends well with this sleuth's romance.Mr. Holt is miscast in the part of the sleuth. Walter Connolly portrays the chief crook and he gives an excellent performance, which at least atones for some of the shortcomings in the film. Lillian Miles is acceptable as the torch singer. Gavin Gordon is not fortunate in the rôle of Perry.A \\"Silly Symphony\\" cartoon in color called \\"Santa's Workshop\\" is excellent. It reveals Santa Claus and his cohorts preparing for his annual visit to good little boys and girls. There are the making of dolls and horses, the marching of toy soldiers into Santa's sack, the preparations of the reindeer, with the brushing of the animals and the cleaning of their teeth. It is a joyous little bit of film, which one wishes were four times its length.Dancing and Singing.In the stage production are several numbers, including \\"The Dragon,\\" in which the new Roxyettes appear","excerpt":"the \\"Hungarian Fantasy\\" and \\"Budapest.\\"Catherine lattlefield, a dancer, gives two exhibitions of her grace and rhythm.

The new picture is of German origin and was directed by Kurt Barnhardt. Benjamin de Casseres was the American editor.\\"The Prince of Rogues\\" is interesting, with fair characterizations and not too much of a story. Hans Struewe plays the leading rôle, that of a Teutonic Robin Hood, and Lissi Arna is the heroine.The story is about a peasant who so resented the cat-o-nine-tails attention on the part of the nobility that he turned robber. Like Robin Hood, he robbed the rich and gave to the poor. Apparently the stylites complex got the better of him, however, for he thought that he could free the world from oppression. He was ultimately captured and shot.Perhaps the best part of the picture is the section at its close, when the prince of rogues, on the way to his death, sees his son for the first time.

It can be classed only as experimental, however, for an audience attempting to take it by any other category of merits would only laugh it away.\\"The Lion and the Mouse\\" has snatches of spoken dialogue","excerpt":"the \\"Lights of New York\\" has it throughout. The tonal quality of the latter is about the same as hat of the first, save that no one in the \\"Lights\\" is able to give as good account of himself as Lionel Barrymore in \\"The Lion.\\"The picture trundles haltingly along for about a third of its length, and, then, when music and dancing enter, at zooms upward. Music and songs—where the letter \\"s\\" is not so important—are much better in vitaphone than direct speech. When the cabaret scene is left behind the play goes down again, once more haltingly.More care has been lavished on the sound than on the camera's ordinary sphere of activity, for none of the players will better their records by the performances in the \\"Lights of New York.\\" They all overact at times, underact at others, and do not seem able to forget even momentarily that not only their faces but their voices as well are being taken for posterity.The plot of the play is crude in the extreme, containing sharpers, bootleggers, cabaret dancers and a detective who advises youth to go \\"where there are trees and grass and flowers.\\" It has a happy ending, due to the fact that the bold, bad night-club proprietor's discarded mistress finally tells the police that it was she who did the shooting, not the young man from the country.The only evidence of careful direction to be found is in a cabaret scene when a door opens and the music sounds louder. Then, when it closes again, the music grows dim.While the picture could not be described as the best of entertainment, it is novel and may, in its halting manner, be pointing the way to the future.

Despite an unnecessarily flamboyant title and a somewhat obvious American-language sound track, the adventure is both serious and engrossing and a revealing tribute to the dauntless men who risked their lives via these explosive tactics.The producers were aided by Luigi Durand De La Penne, an Italian naval officer who actually blew up a British warship in 1941 and doubles in underwater shots for the actor who portrays his fictional counterpart in the film. Also seen are other survivors of the actual wartime deeds herein dramatizing how the Italian Navy's \\"frogmen\\" were trained for and carried out their perilous but devastating missions.Since it is fairly apparent in this case that the truth did not need much enlarging, the scenes depicting \\"frogmen\\" being educated secretly in the use of special suits, \\"fins\\" and respirators for sub-marine swimming are highly interesting. And their instructions in the details and handling of the specially made \\"pig\\"—a torpedo-like craft, electrically propelled above and under water by a pilot and mechanic and carrying a high-explosive \\"head\\" that is detached and fixed to the hull of an enemy ship—is popular mechanics of a frightening but fascinating nature.The details of the actual attacks in Gibraltar harbor—the daredevils use an Italian freighter interned at Algeciras as a base from which they launch their \\"pigs\\"—are melodramatic but not overplayed. Although the beauteous Eleonora Rossi Drago has been dragged in to portray a saloon singer who is actually a spy, she is merely physically impressive and little else. On the other hand, list as authentically melodramatic and tense sequences showing the transporting by submarine of three \\"pigs\\" and their crews, their launching, their evasion of British patrol boats whose depth charges prove fatal to several \\"invaders\\"","excerpt":"the \\"pigs\\" slipping under the anti-submarine nets, and the climactic destruction of two British warships.Aside from an uncivilized gesture by the British captain who throws our captive hero into the brig knowing his ship will be destroyed, and the exaggerated play-acting of Signorina Drago and a villain who pursues her, the film is strangely devoid of artificial histrionics. Pierre Cressoy, as the commander, and the rest of his intrepid, \\"frogmen\\" crew are sturdy, salty types and seemingly act to the manner born, especially in the murky but vivid underwater sequences.Although \\"Hell Raiders\\" is a strong reminder of the \\"enemy\\" and one of the horrors of war, it is generally sober, arresting and exciting movie fare.

On Monday, Joseph R. Barresi, the Massachusetts Inspector General, wrote a letter to L. Edward Lashman, Secretary of Administration and Finance, saying that the museum was not a \\"cost-effective economic development project\\" and that its sponsors had failed to demonstrate its feasibility. He added that \\"as a practical matter,\\" adverse findings by John I. Carlson Jr., deputy commissioner for capital and planning operations for the state, \\"close the book\\" on the project, known as Mass Moca.   But Mary Sullivan, a spokesman for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who is an advocate of the project, said yesterday, \\"Mass Moca is not dead by a long shot.\\" She pointed out that in a letter to Mr. Lashman on Friday, Mr. Carlson had said Mass Moca did not meet three of the five requirements for state certification but recommended that the state draft a new grant agreement. The new agreement, Mr. Carlson said, should set forth \\"very specific conditions that Mass Moca must meet in order to obtain further state funding.\\" Financing in Question     The museum was proposed five years ago by Thomas Krens, now director of the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, to occupy a vast, abandoned factory complex in the industrial town of North Adams in northwest Massachusetts. It would focus on large-scale art of the 1960's, 70's and 80's, and Mr. Krens said he had pledges of long-term loans of major holdings from the Italian collector Giuseppe Panza di Buomo of Milan, the New York art dealers Ileana and Michael Sonnabend, and the German Architectural Museum in Frankfurt. Now the Guggenheim, in response to a request from Mass Moca's development commission for a collaborator in the project, is seeking to become Mass Moca's operator.   A $35 million grant for the museum's planning, design and construction was approved more than two years ago by the State Legislature. More than $2 million of the grant has been spent on a feasibility study required by the state. Mr. Carlson's review of the much-revised study singles out five \\"critical areas\\" of feasibility for the project and says that two of them, the physical program and schematic plans for the museum building, meet requirements for certification.   But the feasibility study did not satisfy him in three other areas: \\"the amounts, sources and timing of the private capital funding\\" needed to pay the 30 percent of the museum's costs not covered by the state","excerpt":"the \\"post-opening management and operations plans for the facility,\\" and the availability of artworks and money for installation. Before the state could give out more of the $35 million, Mr. Carlson said, the new grant agreement should be drafted with the Mass Moca Cultural Development Commission, which oversees the project.   Yesterday Steve Cotton, first assistant inspector general for the state, said: \\"Mr. Carlson's findings do not preclude the commission from limping ahead on its own. They can still do what has always been open to them, raise $12 million to $14 million in order to call forth the rest of the state grant. But they have failed to raise money for the last year, and nothing suggests a capacity to produce cash in the foreseeable future.\\"   But Joseph Thompson, director of the museum's executive planning group, said yesterday, \\"The project is still very much alive, and we're continuing the work required to launch it.   Mr. Krens resigned from Mass Moca's commission last week to conform to a legal opinion by the Mass Moca Development Commission's chief counsel that it would be a conflict of interest for the Guggenheim actively to pursue an operating agreement while he was still a member of the commission.

MUSICAL ADVANCE","excerpt":"The \\"West Side Story\\" Expands on Screen"},{"year":"1929","title":"The \\"great middle class\\" comes in for a scolding in \\"The Idle Rich,\\" an audible picture that owes its story to Edith Ellis's play, \\"White Collars.\\" Hearing two leather-lunged persons conversing in some of the scenes is none too easy on the eardrums, but when a whole family engages in a lively verbal tilt, several of them talking simultaneously, the result is pandemonium. From the promenade of the Capitol, these particular sequences give one the impression that there is a riot in the auditorium.Aside from the disturbing volume of the voices, this production has a certain merit. A few of the characters are quite well defined, although the action of the tale is invariably incredible. One would have to wander far in. Manhattan to find a family as dull and as stubborn as the Thayers. It would also be no easy matter to discover a millionaire who would bear with what William Van Luyn does in this adventure.There are moments of levity that afforded a deal of mirth yesterday afternoon. For instance, the audience was highly amused when Van Luyn put his hand on a pin cushion while trying to make himself comfortable for the night on a small sofa. Then there is the stentorian Henry, who delivers tirades about the white-collar workers and their hardships. Henry is a tactless specimen of humanity, but finally he decides to accept the position in South America which he had refused because Van Luyn admitted that he had used his influence to get Henry the post. It is at least a comfort to know that Henry is going on a long journey.Joan Thayer, who marries Van Luyn, her employer, without much delay, is not overburdened with common sense, but she is pretty, with faultlessly marceilcd golden hair. Her complex is that her rich husband must be able to live as she did before she became his wife. And then there is the glib Helen Thayer, who is engaged to marry a truck driver named Tom Gibney. Helen refers to her fiance as \\"my truck-driving Romeo.\\" Mr. Gibney hails from the land of the midnight sun and his speech is halting but firm. His eloquence is divided between Helen and a new truck's motor and carrying power. He, of course, does not belong to the white-collar crew.As a gentle pull on the heart strings, there is toward the end the news that Thayer, the father of the family, has lost the job he had held for more than twenty years.Van Luyn has a sense of humor and an idea of human psychology, for when the Thayers refuse a home on Riverside Drive and a house in the country, which he was to give them as a member of the family by marriage, he one day announces with a happy smile that he is going to give his fortune to the building of a hospital for the special benefit of the \\"great middle class.\\" Joan, who has striven, parhaps far too determinedly, to make her husband live as her own people do, is visibly aggrieved at the idea of giving away money for such a purpose. In fact, all the Thayers suffer a change of heart in their consideration of gold and the \\"great middle class.\\"This production was directed by William de Mille, who, despite his stage experience, is guilty of several of the same weaknesses that have afflicted talking films produced by those whose previous work had been confined to client pictures. There are unwieldly lines in the dialogue, and on at least one occasion a character appears to be suddenly afflicted with deafness. There are also unnatural hushes, when the characters seem to be wondering what to say next, which is somewhat surprising considering their garrulousness during other interludes.Mr. de Mille, however, has directed his players well in several scenes. The best character study is that of old Mr. Thayer, played easily and sympathetically by James Neill. Like most screen producers, Mr. de Mille strives for effect in depicting the way in which the Thayers live. In these scenes there is a good deal of harmful exaggeration.Conrad Nagel gives an ingratiating performance as Van Luyn. Bessie Love is capable as Helen. Leila Hyams does moderately well as Joan. Robert Ober is just a wee bit too loud and too tactless as Henry. Edythe Chapman is appealing as the mother, and Paul Kruger is effective as the stolid, gruff, slow-thinking Tom Gibney.On the same program is the first talking \\"Our Gang\\" comedy, a feature that has its moments of merriment and tedium. The outstanding attraction of a long and not especially entertaining stage offering is the dancing scene at the end.Miss Gaynor's Voice.F. W. Murnau's finely directed picture, \\"Four Devils,\\" which was first shown here at the Gaiety Theatre last Autumn, is now at the Roxy, having since been synchronized with a music score, sound effects and a reel of dialogue. The talking comes in the last chapter and Janet Gaynor's voice is then heard for the first time from the screen. It is, a plaintive, childish voice, which, while it does not betray experience in speaking lines, is effective during some periods in the part of the sympathetic and saddened little trapeze performer.The lines she is called upon to utter are not always carefully balanced, which may account for Miss Gaynor's tendency to recite rather than speak them. In the last scenes, however, she does quite well. Her timid speech is a distinct contrast to Mary Duncan's cultivated, sure enunciation, but in view of the fact that Miss Duncan figures in the rôle of the worldly adventuress, this difference in speaking is to be expected.Movietone of Ramsay MacDonald.Through the magic of the Movietone the new Prime Minister of Great Britain, Ramsay MacDonald, is heard in one of the sound news features. Mr. MacDonald is first seen with his son and daughter, discussing the newspaper accounts of the election. The Prime Minister says:\\"Well, these papers are not so very bad this morning. Some of them take a very sensible view of things.\\"Young MacDonald vouchsafes that the photographs are quite good. Miss Ishbel MacDonald in a close-up is then heard saying:\\"I just want to thank the women of this country—the Labor women of this country (Great Britain) for the splendid fight that they have put up for the Labor victory. I feel sure that at present they are all rejoicing in their victory. They have shown tremendous faith in the Labor movement, and I feel that the Labor Government will carry out their desires.\\"Follows then a close-up of Malcolm MacDonald, saying:\\"My father may perhaps be taken to represent the older generation, whilst I represent the younger generation, and I am exceedingly proud that young men and young women did their, part so well in the election, and I am confident that the great majority of them voted for the Labor party. I hope they will continue to do so as they themselves become the older generation of the future. Well, now, I must be off. Good-bye.\\"Ramsay MacDonald then is beheld again. He says:\\"My concerns are going to be for my country. My country at home and my country as an influence abroad. At home we have to face in a way that which we have never faced before—this tremendous problem of unemployment. The problem of the great mass of our people housed under conditions which none of us would care to live under ourselves—uncertain incomes, worrying outlooks. And do remember, my friends, that's not merely for six months or twelve months, but thousands and thousands of these men and women—really good men and women—have to live a life which is unvaried in its monotony. I can assure you that my idea is going to be to give this country (Great Britain) a status in the world based on the righteousness of its action, its enlightenment of policy and its large, generous disinterestedness in helping the world. And I hope that as the result, when the time comes for me to lay down the burdens that I shall have left the country in a very much better state than it was in when I took it on.\\"Well, I am very glad—I was going to say, to have seen you all, but I haven't seen you, but I can imagine you. I am very glad to have met you and to have had the opportunity of saying these things to you. Goodbye.\\"Lou Holtz presides over the destinies of the stage contribution, which is labeled \\"Au Perroquet.\\" It is a nicely staged affair, with plenty of color and action.

It is called \\"Don't Bet on Women,\\" and among those in its cast are Una Merkel, Jeanette MacDonald, Roland Young, J. M. Kerrigan and Edmund Lowe. Its plot may be trifling, but it is worked out with real skill and directed imaginatively by Wiliam K. Howard.The two players who furnish most of the amusement are Miss Merkel and Mr. Young. Both these performers are in their element, Miss Merkel as an ingenuous Southern girl and Mr. Young as the trusting husband of a pretty wife. Tallulah Hope (Miss Merkel) rather recalls a Lorelei Lee without the blonde's gold-digging propensities. No sooner does Tallulah have an idea than she translates it into words, no matter who may be shocked or surprised. She airs her adolescent philosophy with marvelous assurance, all of which is done in a Covington (Ky.) drawl, accompanied by capital acting.As for Mr. Young he gets a far better opportunity than he did in \\"New Moon,\\" and the spectators yesterday afternoon appreciated his brisk wit. Then there is Mr. Kerrigan, the judge of the film of \\"Lightnin',\\" who here happens to be Chipley Duff, the rotund little man to whom the garrulous Tallulah has given her heart. Mr. Duff looks timid, but not so Tallulah.Edmund Low appears as the good-looking Roger Fallon, whose divorced wife informs him that he should have no faith in any woman. Herbert Drake (Mr. Young) is told this by Fallon and, thinking of his own wife, Jeanne, impersonated by Miss MacDonald, he becomes quite indignant on this libel of the fair sex.A little later at a party, Fallon again brings up the discussion with Drake and there ensues a wager of $10,000 that Fallon will not be able to kiss the first woman who passes over a certain line, within twenty-four hours. The first female is awaited. When Drake observes his wife about to approach he is visibly nervous, but she is asked to dance and he is relieved. Then suddenly she leaves the arms of her partner and crosses the line, to the exasperation of Drake and the satisfaction of Fallon.It would not be fair to say who wins the bet or what happens in the subsequent interludes, but, as one may surmise, Jeanne Drake worries her husband. And she does so probably for the rest of his life.Mr. Lowe gives a satisfactory performance. Miss MacDonald is quite effective in her part. Mr. Kerrigan does splendidly as the man ensnared by the Kentucky belle.It is a jolly piece of film work and it is a pity that more productions like it are not made.One of the impressive stage numbers on the surrounding program is \\"The Peanut Vender.\\" A giant vender is perceived, and out of his container fall the peanuts, which in this case are those wonderful dancers, the Roxyettes!

Some Senators spoke earnestly about the new age of communications; others talked slyly about how television - Ho! Ho! Ho! -would leave them untouched. A few potential Presidential candidates, presumably fearful that they might seem immodest, stayed out of sight of the cameras. Meanwhile, as several of its members noted, the Senate was now forever changed.   In theory, the coverage of the Senate sessions, carried by cable television's C-SPAN, is a trial run, ending on July 15. Then, after having thought it all over, the Senators will vote on July 29 on whether to make television a permanent fixture.

Mr. Webb accepted $25,000 for the novel","excerpt":"the 1967, film starring Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross, went on to win Mike Nichols an Academy Award for best direction and earn more than $100 million. A recent London stage adaptation took in $17.7 million, and the stage version was also seen on Broadway. A longtime resident of England, the American-born Mr. Webb was said to owe $2,800 in rent on his apartment in Hove, next to Brighton on the south coast. He shares the premises with Fred, the woman he met in college, married and divorced. He said he had spent five years caring for her after she suffered a nervous breakdown. ''We always worked together, and I had just assumed we would continue like that, but then she had this breakdown, and it threw everything into a cocked hat,'' he said, referring to her role as his illustrator. As for money, it ''comes and goes,'' he said. ''When you need it, you do what you have to do to get it, and when you have a lot, you spend it and then you don't have it.'' Mr. Webb, who said he continued to write although he has published nothing for some time, added that he hoped to improve his finances by writing a book about dealing with Fred's illness.    'Mamma' Goes To Hollywood       Fans of Abba and the international stage hit ''Mamma Mia!,'' below, based on the group's music, can look for the film version of the show somewhere over the rainbow. Arrival time is probably late next year, according to Daily Variety. It reported yesterday that Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman, his partner in the production company Playtone, have reached an agreement with the Abba songwriters Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus, and with Littlestar, the company run by the show's producer, Judy Craymer. Catherine Johnson, who wrote the book for the musical, is at work on the screenplay, and talks with Universal Pictures about financing and distribution are in progress.    Babies for Tom Cruise And Brooke Shields       The watchful waiting has ended. A girl was born to Tom Cruise, 43, and Katie Holmes, 27, below, on Tuesday in Los Angeles. The child was named Suri. Arnold Robinson, a spokesman for Mr. Cruise, said the name, of Hebrew origin, meant princess, or, in Persian, red rose. ''Both mother and daughter are doing well,'' Mr. Robinson said. On the same day a girl was born to Brooke Shields, 40, and her husband, Chris Henchy, 42, a television writer and producer. The child was named Grier. Mr. Cruise criticized Ms. Shields on television last year for taking antidepressants after the birth of her first child, Rowan, who will be 3 next month. Ms. Shields called his remarks ''a disservice to mothers everywhere.''    Ozawa on the Mend       Seiji Ozawa, below, will return to conducting in July, six months after he was hospitalized and canceled his year's commitments at the Vienna State Opera, as well as other engagements, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday from Tokyo. Mr. Ozawa's office said that he planned to lead young professionals in concerts in four Japanese cities in July and would perform in August and September at the annual Saito Kinen, the international classical music festival he founded in 1984. Mr. Ozawa, 70, who was music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1973 to 2002 and is under contract with the Vienna Opera until the end of the 2009-10 season, returned to Tokyo in January for treatment of shingles and exhaustion.

Yet introducing new music to a mainstream audience and into a ballet repertory has always been one of the City Ballet's most honorable traditions. Certainly Mr. Robbins is continuing that tradition. One may or may not like Mr. Reich or Mr. Glass as composers, but the use of their music for ballet is no stranger than Balanchine's use of experimental music in his own works.

Asimov, who died a year ago at the age of 72, published more than 450 books in his lifetime, most of them nonfiction. He was one of the great explainers of his day. Like a missionary sworn to spread the gospel of reason to the unenlightened, he helped introduce an entire generation to the insights of modern science, writing lucidly about everything from the mysteries of matter and energy to the mysteries of the human mind. While he occasionally dabbled in subjects outside his chosen field -- the Bible, say, or the works of William Shakespeare -- he took his self-imposed burden seriously.   No one knew better than Asimov how quickly books about science become obsolete. Even those written from a historical perspective have a relatively short half-life.

How many of the pitchers who have won the Cy Young Award have pitched no-hitters?    A. In their careers, 11 pitchers have achieved both the award and the no-hitter, some more perfectly than others. The left-handers are Warren Spahn, Sandy Koufax, Vida Blue and most recently Fernando Valenzuela. The right-handers are Dean Chance, Catfish Hunter (perfect game), Gaylord Perry, Jim Palmer, Bob Gibson, Tom Seaver and most recently Mike Scott.   Only two members of that staff embellished their Cy Young seasons with a no-hitter. Scott did it for the Houston Astros with a 2-0 decision over the San Francisco Giants in 1986. Koufax did it for the Los Angeles Dodgers, also against San Francisco, with an 8-0 no-hitter in 1963. Then he did it again, 1-0 against the Chicago Cubs, in another Cy Young year, 1965, and this time it was a perfect game.   Cy Young himself was no stranger to no-hitters or perfect games. He pitched one of each for Boston of the American League in 1908 and 1904, respectively, and he also hurled a no-hitter for Cleveland of the National League in 1897. Of course, that all happened a half century before the award named for him was created to go to the outstanding pitcher each season. Hit by the Hit    Q. With two out and a runner on first base for Team A, the batter raps a grounder off the pitcher's legs. The ball bounces toward the Team B second baseman, but strikes the runner going to second. Is he out, ending the inning?    A. The inning still has legs, less sore than the pitcher's. Had he been struck directly, the runner would have been out and the inning would have been over. But by touching the ball, even inadvertently, the pitcher surrendered his defense's chance to field the ball without interference by a runner. So when the runner ran into the ball and \\"interfered\\" with the play, he merely was getting in the way of a second chance by the second baseman. Under that condition, the runner and batter would be ruled safe, and an argument from the Team B manager really wouldn't have a leg to stand on. Stingy N.F.L. Teams     Q. The New York Giants gave up the fewest points during the past National Football League regular season: 211 in a 16-game schedule. Over the last 50 years, what team holds the record for least points allowed during a season?    A. It depends on the length of the season and on ruling out the 1982 and 1987 seasons, which were interrupted, shortened and distorted somewhat by player strikes. Otherwise, if it's a 16-game season we're talking about, then the 1986 Chicago Bears are foremost with 187 points allowed. If it's a 14-game season, then the 1977 Atlanta Falcons hold the mark for holding the opposition to 129 points. In a 12-game season, the distinction goes to the 1949 Philadelphia Eagles, who yielded only 132 points. In an 11-game season, the 1942 Bears stand out with only 84 points scored against them, and over a 10-game season, the cream of the crop is the 1944 Giants, whose opponents managed only 75 points.   Among those five record-holding teams for fewest points allowed in a regular season, the 1977 Falcons finished at 7-7 and failed to make the playoffs","excerpt":"the 1986 Bears went 14-2 but lost in their first playoff game, and the 1942 Bears (11-0) and 1944 Giants (8-1-1) were beaten in championship games by Washington and Green Bay, respectively.   Only the 1949 Eagles wended their stingy way the entire distance. After an 11-1 regular season, the Eagles stopped the pass-minded Los Angeles Rams of Norm van Brocklin, Bob Waterfield, Tom Fears and Crazylegs Hirsch in the title game, 14-0. Short of Goal Line    Q. In pro football, a runner carrying the football can score a touchdown if the ball crosses the plane of the goal line, even if the runner does not. If a receiver catches the ball with his feet in the end zone, but the ball does not cross the plane of the goal line, is that a touchdown, too?    A.  Planely, it isn't, until the ball gets to the goal line, too. Having two feet in the end zone does not guarantee having 6 points in the bank if the ball is still in the plane of play. This is different from the case in which a receiver extends his arms and catches a pass on the sideline with his feet in bounds and the ball beyond the line. On that kind of reception, the ball is spotted based on the location of the feet, not the plane of the ball in relation to the sideline.

There, are hilly woodlands, country estates, lakes, restorations that bring to life the Revolutionary era, and post roads linking communities that once echoed to the tramp of British regulars, Hessian mercenaries and Washington's Continental Army. These days the county is laced with good highways, a boon to visitors who are hunting for houses or antiques, calling at historic sites or merely touring through the countryside. Unlike the county's Interstate highways, the older parkways&#8212;the Hutchinson River, Bronx River, Saw Mill River and Taconic State&#8212;were intended for casual travel. The Bronx&#8217; River Parkway, in fabt, was the world's first automobile parkway and is just 50 years old this year. Although parts of it ate being improved, much of its length from the Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx to the Hawthorne interchange above White Plains offers the same vista&#8208;bridges, waterfalls, ponds, wildfowl and sculptured landscape&#8208;available a half century ago to the original Sunday drivers. Farther north, State Route 100 and U.S. 202 open the way to valleys and quiet villages, and convenient access to the parkways or highways for a quick return to the city.

Marshall led by 17-6 entering the final period, but Youngstown rallied for three touchdowns to win the title. The Penguins scored on a 33-yard pass from Ray Isaac to Herb Williams, a 3-yard run by Ryan Wood with 7 minutes 9 seconds remaining and Smith's clinching run, which capped a 3e-play, 14-yard drive. Youngstown led, 3-0, at halftime, but Marshall scored 17 points in the third quarter on two touchdown passes by Michael Payton and a 42-yard field goal by Dewey Klein.

Losing Christian Laettner was a blow, but Duke's 3-H club -- Hurley, Hill (Grant) and Hill (Thomas) -- will catapult Duke to another Final Four appearance. Grant Hill may be the key","excerpt":"the 6 foot 8 inch junior is fluent in three positions and is the one un-guardable player Duke needs.If Cherokee Parks, the sophomore center-forward, contributes, Duke will be in excellent position for a third consecutive championship. Guess what: the Blue Devils could make it four straight in 1993-94. 2 MICHIGAN (25-9)   The Wolverines should be uneasy about holding a script that seems too perfect to be true: Five starters returning from a team that played for the national championship; two players -- Jalen Rose and Chris Webber -- named to various pre season all America teams. How can they fail?   That's the haunting question. How? Injury? Overconfidence? A flat performance at the most inopportune time. After last season's energizing success, nothing less than a national championship is expected. 3 INDIANA (27-7)    This group of Hoosiers, with Calbert Cheaney and Alan Henderson, could give the Wolverines a ferocious rush for the Big Ten championship. All eyes will be on the Indiana backcourt where critics are openly wondering whether Damon Bailey can consistently operate at point guard in a conference whose talent level has dramatically escalated since Bailey came out of high school three years ago. 4 SETON HALL (23-9)   Terry Dehere and point guard Bryan Caver could be the most explosive backcourt in the nation. But the player who will push Seton Hall up and over the Hills is Luther Wright, the Pirates' 7-2 center. Wright has done all of the physical work, shedding nearly 30 pounds during the summer. From this point, coaches say, the improvement will largely be mental. If Wright blossoms this season, the Pirates could be devastating. 5 KENTUCKY (29-7)   Jamal Mashburn, on the other hand, has an acutely refined sense of self confidence. In two seasons, the junior forward has blossomed into one of the most feared frontcourt players in the nation. He'll be teamed this season with Roderick Rhodes, a highly regarded 6-? freshman forward from New Jersey. Rick Pitino has a knack for shaping a team with good talent around a superstar. 6 KANSAS (27-5)   At a time when too many college coaches lose sight of the fact that players -- not coaches -- win games, Jayhawk Coach Roy Williams has managed to be intense without being irrational. His teams Jayhawks have been similarly well balanced. Adonis Jordan has emerged as the marquee name at point guard, but shooting guard Rex Walters can be deadly. The most important player for Kansas this year will be junior college transfer Darrin Hancock, an incredibly gifted forward who, by season's end, could help lift the Jayhawks to the Final Four. 7 FLORIDA STATE (22-10)   Basketball or football, the Seminoles a fun team to watch. Last season, their first in the Atlantic Coast Confernece, they finished second to Duke. This season all five starters return.Bobby Sura, Douglas Edwards, Sam Cassell are all key Seminole players, but the most important piece in the puzzle, point guard Charlie Ward, won't be available until Jan. 2. Ward is the football team's starting quarterback. 8 NORTH CAROLINA (23-10)   You know going into a season that, at the very least, North Carolina will be in the thick of things come March. With junior center Eric Montross and 6-7 forward George Lynch, ??? Carolina has the nucleus of another outstanding team.  9 MEMPHIS STATE (23-11)   Everyone talks about Michigan's Fab Five, but Anfernee Hardaway and David Vaughn, first-year players last season, return this year to make the Tigers a mighty force. At 6-8, Hardaway is an extraordinary passer while Vaughn, at 6-9, is strong and mobile with a versatile shooting touch. 10 TULANE (21-9)   Under Coach Perry Clark, the Green Wave has made astounding progress in the last several years, finishing 22-9 last season with an upset of St. John's in the national tournament. The challenge this season is to build on last year's success. 11 SYRACUSE (22-10)   The Orangemen aren't eligible for the N.C.A.A. tournament, having been placed on probation by the N.C.A.A. after a year long investigation. But guards Adrian Autry, Michael Edwards and center Conrad McRae make this team the second-best in the Big East.  12 CINCINNATI (29-5)   The Bearcats are a tough team. And while toughness might eventually wilt in the presence of talent, as it did last March when Cincinnati was brutalized by Michigan, it can certainly carry a team great distances. Guard Nick Van Exel epitomizes the rejuvenated Bearcats; as he goes so go the Bearcats. 13 OHIO STATE (25-6)   The loss of Jimmy Jackson to the N.B.A. takes a major plug out of Randy Ayers plans to advance farther in the post season tournament this season. Suddenly, the mantle of leadership falls on Lawrence Funderburke, the junior center who came into his own last year after a two year layoff.  14 U.N.L.V. (26-2)   From the Shark Tank to the Think Tank? Critics and fans have wondered what Rollie Massimino would do in situation where he had a higher level of talent to coach than he did at Villanova. Beginning this season, they'll find out. In J.R. Rider, a 6-5 junior, Massimino has one of the most talented players he has ever coached. Look for a U.N.L.V.team that is just as defense-oriented, albeit with more variations. 15 GEORGIA TECH (23-12)   After Kenny Anderson left two seasons ago, Yellow Jacket fans assumed that they had seen the last of prodigal talent. Enter Travis Best, a 5-11 sophomore who, while not as dynamic as Anderson, is clearly a state of the art player. He'll team with James Forrest, a 6-8 sophomore, and Malcolm Mickey, a 6-11 center.  16 ALABAMA (26-9)   The Crimson Tide has a new, unplaided look this season with first year coach David Hobbs. The Alabama attack will be built around James (Hollywood) Robinson, a 6-1 junior guard.  17 ARIZONA (24-7)   A number of critics -- and fans -- have just about lost faith in Arizona's ability to be the West Coast team that overcomes East Coast muscle. In last year's tournament, the third seeded Wildcats were upset by 14th-seeded East Tennessee State. This season, the heart and soul of the team will be New York-born Khalid Reeves, a 6-1 junior guard, and Chris Mills, a 6-6 senior forward. 18 MICH. STATE (22-8)   Mike Peplowski, the 6-10 senior center, has overcome a series of knee injuries and put forth so much effort and enthusiasm for the Spartans. What better way to go out than a good run through the tournament. 19 NEW MEXICO ST. (25-8)   In an era dominated by 6-8 swing players and 7 foot rejectors, don't you love a team whose most dynamic player is a 5 foot 8 inch point guard. Enter Sam Crawford. The Aggies senior guard, is a sparkplug who ignites New Mexico State's potent offense.  20 OKLAHOMA ()   Billy Tubbs is promising fans a return to the up-beat, up tempo style of play that characterized the Sooners during the mid and late 1980's. To pull it off, Tubbs is relying on three redshirt guards: Dion Barnes, Chris Black and Shon Alexander. Center Bryan Sallier was the Big Eight's leading rebounder last season.

This seven-CD collection prefers the music of that milieu -- the ''alternative rock'' of the decade's first half -- over the hip-hop, alt-country, electronica, rap-rock and teen-pop that also provided the soundtrack for the span from Nirvana to Y2K. Unfortunately, grunge dominates, with Tad, Mudhoney and Screaming Trees crowding out hip-hop beyond novelties like ''O.P.P.'' and ''They Want EFX.'' Oddly, the Northwestern stalwarts Sleater-Kinney and Mudhoney are represented by second-rate songs, though the box does right by grunge knockoffs like Bush and Stone Temple Pilots. Thankfully, there are happy glimpses of postalternative quirkiness that briefly passed as mainstream pop, like the Cardigans' ''Lovefool,'' Fountains of Wayne's ''Radiation Vibe'' and Len's ''Steal My Sunshine.''

It is instead a particular family's story, an account of how one clever woman, long ago in a Polish shtetl, managed to save her household. Like all of Mr. Mamet's work, this dark little tale is laced with foreboding and imminent violence. It is also rife with trademark Mametian dialogue","excerpt":"the aborted, unfinished sentences have an edgy, staccato rhythm that creates an undercurrent of tension. The setting is one of pure domesticity: an older woman and her granddaughter are in the kitchen preparing food for the seder table. They are making haroset, the mix of apples, raisins, honey, walnuts and wine that symbolizes the mortar used to bind the bricks of ancient Egypt. As the young girl cuts up the apples and chops the nuts, bits and pieces of family lore are revealed. The grandmother has been in the Israeli Army; the samovar brought over from the old country, which an aunt had made into a lamp, has disappeared; but great-great-great grandmother Clara's candlesticks have been saved. Inevitably, since this is a Mamet story, attention is focused on the knife the girl is wielding. And a large, glittering chef's knife figures ominously in many of Michael McCurdy's beautifully rendered drawings. The young girl asks if this was the knife Clara had used, so many years earlier, to thwart death. Her grandmother then tells how Clara, during a pogrom at Passover, created a scene of bloody devastation that fooled the enemy. The rampaging Cossacks miraculously passed over Clara's house; her family survived to tell the tale.

In the early 1830's, when the French literary critic Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve set out to write what would turn out to be his only novel, he probably intended to create a book in which knowledgeable readers would recognize the outline of his affair with Victor Hugo's wife -- while also, of course, delighting in the political and psychological adventures of his lustful young hero, Amaury.

Presented as a cautionary letter from Amaury (now a 60-year-old priest) to a young unnamed friend, \\"Volupte\\" describes Amaury's involvement in a monarchist plot against Napoleon, his ardent pursuit and psychological torture of three women of high pedigree, his fall into depravity with Parisian prostitutes and his final decision to join a seminary. Tossing about rhetorical questions like \\"Can a man keep a flame burning in his breast without his clothes catching fire?,\\" Amaury revels in depicting his \\"malign disposition\\" and \\"the foul gutter\\" he crosses when he gives in to lust.

The trio returned to the repertory Friday evening, and though it is impossible to hear the third score played as well as it was by the Met orchestra without being newly bewitched, satisfaction was oddly elusive through most of the evening.   These three works speak the language of the bizarre and the piquant","excerpt":"the accents are of barbed satire or of discreet sensuality, but never exaggerated, never ponderous, never fully serious (except with the seriousness of a child's wonder in the Ravel). They must charm or they have no life: charm is not all there is to them, but it is the contact point through which the rest of their substance can reach us.

For the first time since he took office in 1987, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has said that the economy is in decline. Addressing a House committee on Wednesday, he stopped just short of calling the downturn that began in October a recession. \\"It may get there,\\" he said the next day, mindful that a recession technically requires two straight quarters of decline. He is not about to panic. \\"The world out there when you look at the hard data is not in as bad shape as it feels,\\" he told Congress. And asked whether he would cut interest rates, he was strenuously noncommittal. But economists have little doubt that more generous Fed policies are in store. As William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds, put it, \\"When the man comes down from Mount Olympus and says we're in a meaningful downturn, that's significant. It clears up all doubt about where the Fed stands.\\" An Economic Oxymoron  Maybe they should call them the lagging indicators. The index of leading indicators released on Friday signaled a recession, after everyone had already agreed that the economy has turned down. A 1.2 percent decline for October and a slight adjustment to yield a negative reading for July mean the index has dropped four months in a row","excerpt":"the accepted recession signal is three. Economists, with a glance at their charts, are quick to point out that the index forecasted a recession after the 1987 stock market crash. None occurred. This time, the indicators are merely late. The G.N.P. and the Gulf  The third-quarter figure for the gross national product suggests that the economy only reversed course after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The G.N.P. grew at a 1.7 percent rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported last week, a tenth of a point lower than its earlier estimate. Mr. Greenspan said the decline began in October, mostly because of the crisis in the Middle East. Freeing the Banks  Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady proposed allowing banks and securities firms to merge and letting banks expand across state lines. Mr. Brady, with the President's backing, is preparing legislation to overhaul the banking system and repeal many of the restrictions in effect since the Depression. The regulatory structure \\"is outmoded, burdensome and inefficient,\\" he said. \\"And its flaws are an unseen contributor to our financial institutions' current difficulties.\\" He said he is worried about the financial industry's declining profits and its ability to counter rivals from abroad. Credit Squeeze  Beware a December squeeze in short-term credit. When the bond market curiously weakened for a couple days after Mr. Greenspan said the economy was in decline, some economists said banks were choking off much of the credit they usually provide for trading securities. The banks want to look as sound as possible at year-end, Neal M. Soss, the First Boston chief economist, said. \\"If bankers in normal times like to window-dress their balance sheets,\\" he said, \\"imagine what will happen after the turmoil of the last year.\\" In Brief  President Bush said on Friday that he might waive trade restrictions and send food to help the Soviet Union through the winter. Germany has taken the lead in shipping supplies. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposed allowing savings and loans to convert to state-chartered savings banks. For the Downwardly Mobile  A publication for the 1990's: Pauper, with the initial quarterly issue this spring to feature \\"articles about poor celebrities, bankrupt businesses, failed financial institutions, tips on frugal living, personal issues on the culture of poverty and, hopefully, lots of advertising aimed at the low end of the down-scale market.\\" Richard Grayson, an unemployed Fort Lauderdale, Fla., computer teacher and the magazine's publisher, editor and staff, swears his plans are no joke. But his press release sounds suspiciously parodistic, saying that a Pauper 400 list will answer the lists of the super-rich in \\"wealth-oriented magazines.\\" Mr. Grayson has his own woes. He said he was laid off in the Dade County schools' budget cuts, his unemployment insurance has run out and he supports himself with a temporary job teaching English. He doubts the publication -- \\"a kitchen-table job\\" -- will make him rich.  INTERNATIONAL   Ready to Talk  Having demonstrated his readiness to use tanks, troops, fighters, bombers and rockets to bludgeon Iraq, President Bush began talking about a deal. The United Nations Security Council voted Thursday to authorize an attack on Iraqi forces unless they leave Kuwait by Jan. 15. President Bush said the next day that he would welcome a visit by the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, and wanted to send Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to Baghdad. Oil prices plunged $4.06 a barrel, to $28.85, on Friday; stock and bond markets soared so abruptly that some on Wall Street found the volatility alarming. As Stephen S. Roach, the senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said, \\"The economy is being driven more by fear than reality.\\"  A More Pliable Britain  For John Major, breakfast at 10 Downing Street might be the next best thing to beans on toast with bacon at a south London cafe. The former Chancellor of the Exchequer won a Conservative Party election to succeed Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister. He shares her working-class roots and free-market convictions. But he is a bit more likely than Mrs. Thatcher to think of his nation as part of Europe. At age 47, Mr. Major is the first major European leader too young to remember World War II. He, like Mrs. Thatcher, is no friend of a single European currency and central bank. But he is more willing to bend. Last month, he helped persuade her to have Britain join the European Monetary System, linking the pound's value to other currencies. Japan's Real Estate Problems  Japan's corporate safety net has holes large enough for a major developer to fall through. The Kyowa Company, whichrode the crest of real estate speculation, filed the equivalent of a bankruptcy petition last week, a rare event in Japan's clubby corporate world. Hugh T. Patrick, director of the Center on Japanese Economy and Business at Columbia University, said Kyowa will be only the first. \\"There are some very speculative real estate ventures that are going to go bankrupt,\\" he said. \\"Some big ones.\\" Financial institutions are restricting credit and the central bank wants lower real estate prices, he said. COMPANIES   G.M. Scales Back  The implosion of the General Motors Corporation continues. On Thursday, the company said it was cutting back fourth-quarter car and truck production in North America by 111,000, to 1,186,000, after its target had been trimmed by 181,000 earlier this year. The company cited a weakening economy due to the Persian Gulf crisis and consumers who are doing more brooding than buying. But since Robert C. Stempel became the company's president and then chairman earlier this year, he has been trying to keep G.M. from building more cars than the public will buy. The auto maker took a record $1.98 billion loss in the third quarter, reflecting the cost of shutting as many as nine plants. Analysts say another loss is all but certain in the current quarter. Captured within the world's largest company, it seems, is a much smaller company struggling to get out. Eastern Gets a Raise  Eastern Airlines persuaded a bankruptcy judge on Tuesday that to play with the big boys in the industry it needed a larger allowance. Judge Burton R. Lifland allowed it to withdraw as much as $135 million from escrow to continue operating. Creditors howled, but an Eastern executive said the money was essential because nobody would buy tickets on an airline facing imminent liquidation. Japan's Unrivaled Wealth  No wonder that the largest takeover in the United States this year reflects Japanese financial might. The Matsushita Electric Industrial Company's agreement on Monday to pay $6.13 billion in cash for MCA Inc. is also Japan's largest corporate acquisition in the United States. No American bidder emerged to challenge an offer worth about $69 a share, less than the $75 that an intermediary at first told MCA's chairman, Lew R. Wasserman, to expect. Many American companies are entering a likely recession with weak balance sheets, and corporate raiders can no longer raise money by spewing out high-yield bonds. As Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker, told the MCA board, only a handful of companies can write a $6 billion check.  Computer Censorship?  You can use the mail to complain about lousy postal service, and the phone to gripe about high phone bills. But don't try using the Prodigy Services Company's computerized shopping and information service to attack its fees. Prodigy pulled the plug on a dozen members who used the system to complain to advertisers and start a boycott of them to protest the service's plan for additional charges. Beginning Jan. 1, Prodigy will charge 25 cents for each message beyond 30 a month, in addition to the $12.95 monthly charge. The users whose accounts have been canceled say they are victims of electronic censorship. Prodigy has offered to reinstate them if they agree to quit assaulting advertisers with their computerized complaints.

BRIEFS"},{"year":"1994","title":"The debate over the sentencing of Michael Fay, the Ohio teen-ager who vandalized cars in Singapore and faces six lashes with a rattan pole, illustrates the enduring tension between order and liberty in all societies. Singapore is probably the safest city in the world, although at the expense of many individual rights. \\n\\nSingapore is the lengthened shadow of Lee Kuan Yew, who ruled as Prime Minister for 31 years. He took the country from poverty to plenty in one generation (its per capita gross national product is higher than that of its erstwhile colonizer, England). Upon leaving office in 1990, he took the title of Senior Minister and remains enormously influential. He has also embarked on a career of sorts as a pundit, speaking his mind with impolitic frankness. In January, I interviewed him.\\n\\nQ. Do you view the United States as a model for other countries? \\n\\nA. I find attractive and unattractive features. I like the free, easy and open relations between people regardless of social status, ethnicity or religion. And the things I have always admired about America: the openness in argument about what is good or bad for society","excerpt":"the accountability of public officials, and the lack of secrecy and terror that are part and parcel of Communist government. \\n\\nBut as a total system, I find parts of it totally unacceptable: guns, drugs, violent crime, vagrancy, unbecoming behavior in public -- in sum, the breakdown of civil society. The expansion of the right of the individual to behave or misbehave as he pleases has come at the expense of orderly society. In the East, the main object is to have a well-ordered society so that everybody can have maximum enjoyment of his freedoms. This freedom can only exist in an ordered state and not in a natural state of contention and anarchy. \\n\\nLet me give you an example that encapsulates the whole difference between America and Singapore. America has a vicious drug problem. How does it solve it? It goes around the world helping other antinarcotic agencies to try and stop the suppliers. It pays for helicopters, defoliating agents and so on. And when it is provoked, it captures the President of Panama and brings him to trial in Florida. \\n\\nSingapore does not have that option. We can't go to Burma and capture warlords. What we can do is pass a law which says that any customs officer or policeman who sees anybody in Singapore behaving suspiciously, leading him to suspect the person is under the influence of drugs, can require that person to have his urine tested. If the sample is found to contain drugs, the man immediately goes for treatment. In America, if you did that it would be an invasion of the individual's rights and you would be sued.\\n\\nI was interested to read that Colin Powell, when he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. military followed our approach because when a recruit signs up he agrees to be tested. Now, I would have thought this kind of approach would be quite an effective way to deal with the terrible drug problem you have. But the idea of the inviolability of the individual has been turned into dogma. And yet nobody minds when the Army captures the president of another state and puts him in jail. I find that incomprehensible. This approach will not solve America's drug problem. Whereas with Singapore's way, we may not solve it, but we will lessen it considerably, as we have done.\\n\\nQ. Would it be fair to say that you admired America more 25 years ago? What, in your view, went wrong?\\n\\nA. Yes, things have changed. I would hazard a guess that it has a lot to do with the erosion of the moral underpinnings of a society and the diminution of personal responsibility. The liberal, intellectual tradition that developed after World War II claimed that human beings had arrived at this perfect state where everybody would be better off if they were allowed to do their own thing and flourish. It has not worked out, and I doubt that it will. Certain basics about human nature do not change.\\n\\nMan needs a certain moral sense of right and wrong. There is such a thing called evil, and it is not the result of being a victim of society. You are just an evil man, prone to do evil things, and you have to be stopped from doing them. Westerners have abandoned an ethical basis for society, believing that all problems are solvable by a good government, which we in the East never believed possible.\\n\\nQ. Is such a fundamental shift in culture irreversible?\\n\\nA. No, it is a swing of the pendulum. I think it will swing back. I don't know how long it will take, but there's already a backlash in America against failed social policies that have resulted in people urinating in public, in aggressive begging in the streets, in social breakdown.\\n\\nQ. You say that your real concern is that this system not be foisted on other societies because it will not work there. Is there another viable model for political and economic development? Is there an \\"Asian model\\"?\\n\\nA. I don't think there is an Asian model as such. But Asian societies are unlike Western ones. The fundamental difference between Western concepts of society and government and East Asian concepts is that Eastern societies believe that the individual exists in the context of his family. He is not pristine and separate. The family is part of the extended family, and then friends and the wider society. The ruler or the government does not try to provide for a person what the family best provides. \\n\\nIn the West, especially after World War II, the governments came to be seen as so successful that they could fulfill all the obligations that in less modern societies are fulfilled by the family. This approach encouraged alternative families, single mothers for instance, believing that government could provide the support to make up for the absent father. \\n\\nThis is a bold, Huxleyan view of life but one from which I as an East Asian shy away. I would be afraid to experiment with it. I'm not sure what the consequences are, and I don't like the consequences that I see in the West. You will find this view widely shared in East Asia. \\n\\nIt's not that we don't have single mothers here. We are also caught in the same social problems of change when we educate our women and they become independent financially and no longer need to put up with unhappy marriages. But there is grave disquiet when we break away from tested norms, and the tested norm is the family unit. It is the building brick of society.\\n\\nGovernments will come, governments will go, but this endures. We start with self-reliance. In the West today it is the opposite. The government says give me a popular mandate and I will solve all society's problems.\\n\\nQ. What would you do instead to address America's problems?\\n\\nA. What would I do if I were an American? First, you must have order in society. Guns, drugs and violent crime all go together, threatening social order. Then the schools -- when you have violence in schools, you are not going to have education, so you've got to put that right. Then you have to educate rigorously and train a whole generation of skilled, intelligent, knowledgeable people who can be productive. \\n\\nI would start off with basics, working on the individual, looking at him within the context of his family, his friends, his society. But the Westerner says: \\"I'll fix things at the top. One magic formula, one grand plan. I will wave a wand and everything will work out.\\" It's an interesting theory but not a proven method.

Westermann, Robert Arneson and Joan Brown are less fixed in art world consciousness than they should be. Ditto for Roy DeForest, who is showing new paintings for the first time since 1997 at the George Adams Gallery in Chelsea. At 75, Mr. DeForest is painting pretty much what he has painted for years: dogs, men in hats or headdresses, and supernatural beings against a flattened terrain. Angular, masklike, brusquely rendered, they all seem shamanistic and slightly crazed; their bright, staring eyes imply the ingestion of hallucinatory substances. Mr. DeForest continues to favor dense compositions and oppressively bright colors unrelieved by much in the way of white. (The white goat in ''Goat Daze,'' above, is an exception.) His signature technique persists: tiny dollops of paint, whose culminating twists suggest chocolate chips but also thumbtacks, with their points facing out. His new works have become slightly more structured: compartmentalized into patchworks of portraits, friezes and pictures within pictures, as if the artist had a new appreciation for classic American folk art. They are also more inventive and sensuous in their handling of paint. The bristling textures have diversified -- new additions include mosaiclike sections of dried acrylic paint -- and the clearer composition increases their impact. These works have a blatant, consummate ease. If Mr. DeForest's goal is to transfer the ecstatic experience of the world from his creature-subjects to his creature-viewers, it has never been more clearly or radiantly stated.

Nor will it detract any from the new display of violent passions now being exhibited at the Paramount Theatre to reveal that the lady's dipsomaniac husband, who is district attorney of Iverstown, used his office at his wife's behest to execute an innocent man for the crime she committed in her 'teens. Walter O'Neil witnessed the killing of Martha's martinet aunt, and, though he helped her to lie her way out of the accidental tragedy, his scheming father realized the truth and subsequently engineered a cold, hateful marriage between the two, solely that his son might enjoy the Ivers wealth and social position.All this is established quite early in the two-hour long film, which is essentially a suspensful and at times quite harrowing exposition of moral and, to a somewhat lesser extent, physical decay. The tempestuous nature of Martha is established in a prologue covering events some eighteen years previous to the drama's main action when the willful girl, who has ample reason for detesting her cruel, domineering aunt, is prevented from running away with a lad named Sam Masterson, who was in the house that fateful night. It is Sam's return home and his request to Walter to obtain the release of a girl who is picked up for parole violation that sets the spark to a chain of vengeful events which bring out the diabolical natures of the characters. As the lives of the four are criss-crossed and exposed in a maze of narrative, which is sometimes as coldly revealing as police-blotter notation and conversely maudlin, all their sordid deeds are neatly pulled together like so many pieces in a jigsaw puzzle.And reminding one of a jigsaw puzzle, there are long stretches in \\"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers\\" when it seems as though the director, Lewis Milestone, and Robert Rossen, the author, will not be able to gather in all the pieces of the rambling plot. But they manage it expeditiously, if with less finesse and surprise than one could wish. True, it would be a rather simple matter to knock the chocks from under the plot — the circumstances surrounding the death of Martha's aunt leave reasonable doubt as to whether a jury would have convicted Martha of manslaughter in the first place. Yet, it is to the credit of all concerned with the making of the picture that it holds interest most of the way.Miss Stanwyck is twice the hard-boiled, lustful vixen that she played in \\"Double Indemnity,\\" though her characterization of Martha is more on a one-dimensional plane. Kirk Douglas is convincing as her husband. But it is Van Heflin as Sam who has the meatiest role, and he makes the most of it. This is the actor's first part since he was discharged from the Army, and he brings to it that quality of rugged integrity and certainty of action that is characteristic of Spencer Tracy's acting. Lizabeth Scott, as the girl on parole, has some pretty silly-sounding lines, and her performance generally lacks conviction, a circumstance that finds the author responsible, too, since the character is poorly written.The Paramount's stage show features Dinah Shore, Dick Stabile and his orchestra, Gil Lamb, the dancer-commedian","excerpt":"The Acromaniacs and Tommy Sanford.

Her emphasis on painting process might link her to Chuck Close, her meticulous re-creations of photographs in paint and graphite to Gerhard Richter, and the soft, gray backgrounds of her works from the 1960's to Brice Marden. Looking at the images she has made over the last 28 years, 66 of which form a spare and illuminating exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, it also seems likely that Ms. Celmins helped set the stage for the highly artificialized realism that permeated the art of the 1980's. Signs of her influence can be seen on artists as diverse as Jack Goldstein, Troy Brauntuch, David Deutsch and Ross Bleckner.    Despite such possible connections and credits, Ms. Celmins has always been oddly on her own, an artist's artist who has quietly pursued her almost obsessive vision without benefit of stardom. In career and sensibility she seems closest to a late-blooming abstract painter like Agnes Martin or, even more, the reclusive 50's artist Myron Stout, with whom she shares a penchant for technical perfection, graphite and small images, as well as a low, sporadic output.

The crazy juxtapositions and winking naïveté that defined a visual style are now the stuff of everyday life. Theatrical surrealism survives in two varieties: the menacing and the ridiculous.

As for the ridiculous vein, few have mined it more assiduously than CHRISTOPHER DURANG, creator of such cracked theatrical gems as Sister Mary Ignatius (the frying nun) and ''The Marriage of Bette and Boo.'' If Mr. Durang has sometimes seemed to be recycling gestures, that's a limitation of the genre -- and, cleverly, it's the subject of ''MISS WITHERSPOON,'' in which a suicide victim named Veronica (mistakenly called Miss Witherspoon while in limbo) resists reincarnation. Each time she is forced back to life, she devises a more hilarious (and calamitous) way to die. The real Miss Witherspoon, if there is one, never appears. Previews start Friday, Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.

Fifty years since its English-language premiere, the existential angst that audiences once found so mystifying is old news even to high school students, but the play's unsurpassed strength turns out to have nothing to do with obscurity.

Fang Mulheisen. \\"He had a predilection for obscure, nondescript neighborhoods, forgotten places,\\" the author says of Fang's deep but unsentimental affection for his city. \\"It seemed the right place to find a corpse.\\"   A retired cop named Grootka actually beats Fang to that corpse -- the body of a snitch known on the street as Books because he hung out at a bar called the Library. Grootka almost steals off with the novel, too. Working in tandem with Fang, on the trail of a onetime teen-age psychopath who has matured into an equally deadly computer genius, Grootka always seems to get there first, full of fight. But Fang is the one with the sensitivity to process what they come across: information from characters like Doc Gaskill, the newspaper columnist and souse who strives not for \\"a splendid defiance of grammar\\" but for a certain \\"commodiousness of expression\\"","excerpt":"the action in seedy bars where a jazz trio might be playing \\"Meet Me in the Alley With Your Gym Shoes On\\"; and the helter-skelter ideology of cop justice, which Grootka renders in his favorite phrase: \\"The world is round.\\"   Although the series is still only three books deep, Mr. Jackson stands right up there with the best of the urban crime chroniclers.    \\"My name is Cassandra Reilly and I don't live anywhere.\\" On that blithe note begins GAUDI AFTERNOON (Seal Press, paper, $8.95), a high-spirited comic adventure in which Barbara Wilson, author of the admirable but rather more solemn Pam Nilsen mystery series, introduces a dashing new feminist sleuth.   A literary translator with a chronic case of wanderlust, the peripatetic Cassandra lands in Barcelona when a friend of a friend requests a Spanish-speaking guide to help her find her runaway husband. That done, the lesbian heroine prepares to enjoy the rest of her stay with good friends like Carmen, a hairdresser and a real spitfire, and Ana, an architect of whimsical playhouses for children, among other characters drawn with affection and humor. But comic complications assert themselves in a custody battle that involves Cassandra with a wacky circle of lesbians, gay men, transvestites and transsexuals, all fighting over a child named Delilah who is, indeed, a doll.   In the same way that she works issues of sexual politics into her madcap plot, Ms. Wilson also makes the city of Barcelona a lively party to the action. Her enthusiasm for the surreal architecture of Antoni Gaudi, in particular, surfaces in both the playful unreality of her story and her startling views of the city Gaudi dressed with his wit.    Ole!     The man is fat and his politics are shady. But he has a beautiful mind and a silver tongue, both excellent credentials for a detective. In THE ANGST-RIDDEN EXECUTIVE (Serpent's Tail/ Consortium Book Sales, paper, $9.95), Manuel Vazquez Montalban's formidably intelligent Spanish shamus, Pepe Carvalho, is astonished to learn that a businessman whom he met on a brief trip has been murdered. To his further surprise, he discovers that the executive had been a student revolutionary, part of a 1950's anti-Franco political cell whose six surviving members -- all of them grown up and most of them flush with capitalist-acquired success -- are now prime suspects in his death.   Under the guise of a detective procedural, the Barcelona-born novelist has written a provocative study of the spectrum of political thought among modern Spanish intellectuals. \\"I used to think that Spaniards were cut out to be only executioners or their victims,\\" Carvalho says to the executive, who smartly replies: \\"The victim ones are particularly suited to being foremen in foreign countries. They've got the fears of a born loser, the determination of a survivor, and the hardness of a person who knows he can't turn back.\\"   For all the interesting conversation, Mr. Montalban's story doesn't read talky. (Surely some thanks for that goes to the translator, Ed Emery.) An elegant stylist as well as a perceptive social critic, the author writes with eloquence and humor about his countrymen and the murderous follies they will sometimes commit to make a political point and to hang onto an ill-gotten peseta.    Herman who? Any mind comfy in the exacting esthetic discipline of hermeneutics, or \\"the craft of Hermes,\\" should take glee in the intellectual high jinks of Alexander Tzonis' pedagogic mystery, HERMES AND THE GOLDEN THINKING MACHINE (Bradford/MIT, $19.95). Probably the first mystery with a 30-item bibliography, this eccentric mental exercise follows the adventures of Hermes Steganos, an archeologist who specializes in \\"the decipherment of proto-Hellenic texts using modern cryptanalytic methods,\\" in his search for the villain who murdered his uncle and made off with an ancient Greek computation gizmo.   In giving Socratic instruction in the rudiments of artificial intelligence theory, Hermes does most of his detective work at a computer, explaining to a lovely young student the principles of mathematical search systems and the mysteries of heuristics. True, much of this learned chat remains unintelligible to illiterates in higher math; but Mr. Tzonis, the author of several books on architecture and design, writes with the sort of brio one never encounters in textbooks. And while his erudite characters are mainly mouthpieces for various cognitive theories, they can be as witty as the droll academic who points out that \\"the most exciting things the mind does are lie, laugh, and create chaos.\\"    Trust the academic mystery to resist such trendy methods of homicide as decapitation and evisceration and to stick with a nice, civilized case of poisoning. In Virginia Crosby's first novel, THE FAST DEATH FACTOR (Brown Bag/Council Oak, $14.95), one of the disgruntled faculty members or administrators at a liberal arts college does away with the school's fondly loathed president by slipping something deadly into his glass of Chateau d'Yquem. The murder is done at one of those supposedly congenial academic receptions at which the vitriol flows as freely as the grape and, in this instance, proves almost as poisonous.   Ms. Crosby, formerly a teacher and administrator at Pomona College in California, treats with cheery vindictiveness such stock characters as the neglected faculty wife, the long-suffering executive secretary, the popular dean of the college, the power-hungry trustee and so forth. The stiff-upper-idiom formality of their dialogue eventually becomes quite numbing. (Do academics really address their relatives as \\"cousin mine\\"?) Nonetheless, the serpent-toothed inhabitants of these dark groves of academe remain a frisky bunch as they play their dangerous games of campus politics.

''Flood'' is no exemplar of a well-made play","excerpt":"the action is sporadic, the characterization rudimentary. The accomplishment of Charles Otte, who directed and also did the effective lighting, is to give dramatic form to the distinguished writer's dark reflections on human responses to catastrophe. The result can be seen at the Ensemble Theater.   Since the name of the head of the endangered house is Noah (energetically played by Steven Haworth in a beard of patriarchal proportions), and he at one point reads a few lines about the flood from the Book of Genesis, no great powers of deduction are required to see his house as the ark.

Here, stories from some of our outraged correspondents.   There are some things they never teach you in law school. During his first Christmas season after graduation, Ralph Hummel, a lawyer in Huntington, L.I., got an unusual assignment from his boss. It wasn't a chance to work on a big case. It was a chance for Mr. Hummel to use his own car to carry the boss's Christmas tree. Shades of Scrooge and Cratchit dancing in his head, Mr. Hummel asked why. The boss's reply: \\"Well, you wouldn't want the tree to scratch my Mercedes, would you?\\"   At the time, getting hit by a car didn't seem like a great idea. But in retrospect, Barbara Zapson says maybe it all worked out for the best. The accident, which caused a hairline fracture of her spine, happened one July after Ms. Zapson, a New Yorker, had been working for years as an executive assistant in a large company.   \\"My boss never called, never sent flowers or even a card,\\" she writes. But on the third day after the accident, a Friday, he called to ask if she'd be in on Monday. He already knew, of course, that the doctors said Ms. Zapson needed six weeks of bed rest. But the boss said he couldn't do without her. For eight days she worked out of her home. And when she returned to the office, it was with a promise from the boss that his chauffeur would pick her up and drive her home to spare her the rigors of mass transit.    When she came to the office, the boss told her he had good news and bad news. The bad news was that she had used up all her sick leave and now owed him five days. Next, he said that it was no longer convenient for her to use the chauffeur. The good news was that if she gave up her vacation in August, he wouldn't dock her salary.    Ms. Zapson promptly quit. The boss followed her into the street, begging her to come back, telling her he'd give her anything she wanted. She asked to work 9 to 5. \\"Done,\\" he said. She asked him to pay for cabs for the next four weeks. \\"Done,\\" he said. When she asked for her vacation, he said, \\"Impossible.\\" Ms. Zapson said goodbye.   Her P.S.: \\"For the past three years, I'm happily enjoying the best job and best boss I've ever had!\\"   Bosses with tempers? P.H. says, \\"I actually had a boss at a German bank who once had it written in his contract that he could smash only a certain number of phones per month. What that number was I never found out. Other than that, he wasn't such a bad fellow.\\"   F.J.D. has a number of fond memories of his boss. One of them concerns a salesman who fell from a ladder while decorating his house for the holidays. From his hospital bed, the injured man read F.J.D. a short note from the boss, informing the poor fellow he was being dismissed. That, of course, was the bad news. The good news was the boss's chirpy closer: \\"Get well soon.\\"   \\"It is always an unwelcome surprise to wake up one day and find that you are working for Jabba the Hut,\\" is the way Don Mennie, of Mendham, N.J., begins his account of woe. Stretching the limits of his physical endurance, he was commuting 160 miles a day to a technical writing job. On a snowy Friday in March, Mr. Mennie called ahead to say his arrival for the weekly staff meeting might be delayed. When he arrived 15 minutes late, the boss was in a snit.    \\"I was called on the carpet and accused of every imaginable misdeed. My work output was insulted, and I was put on a humiliating 'probation,' which was supposed to run three months while I 'improved my computer skills.' It lasted only about a week.\\" Despite praise from others within the company, Mr. Mennie was told to resign or be terminated.   During his last days with the company, Mr. Mennie discovered that the boss had recruited an old crony, desperate and unemployed, to take his job, and the sham of probation was designed to insure that there were no gaps in the work flow while the deal was made.   Mr. Mennie concludes with these observations: \\"Forget snipers in the post office. Don't get excited about nerve gas in the subways. For most people, this scenario is what workplace terrorism is really all about today.\\"   Not all bad bosses are found in the corporate office. One New York woman, M. L. Maiscott, says, \\"My worst boss was a mother superior I had when I was in the convent many years ago.\\" The mother superior was paranoid, and after complaints from the parents in the school where Ms. Maiscott taught, the mother superior was reassigned.   And not all bad-boss stories have unhappy endings. \\"Since I left the religious life the same day she went to her new post,\\" Ms. Maiscott writes, \\"I heard only later about the fireworks set off from the convent roof by the nuns who, cheering, watched her car drive off.\\"    With a nod toward \\"A Visit From St. Nicholas\\" comes this memorial to bad bosses from a poet who prefers anonymity.:   \\"Good morning,\\" she started, \\"You all look so happy!   I don't want to waste time, so I'll just make it snappy.   With Hay points and re-orgs I have you confused,   So you can't fight my policy changes,\\" she schmoozed.   \\"You'll get sick no longer, 'cause that's just a ruse.   If your kid's in the hospital, it's vacation you'll use.   Your benefits, too, will be cut, I might add.   The good times are over, and that makes me glad.\\"   \\"Forget about service, or doing what you should.   I think everything's fine if the numbers look good!   Reputation on paper is vital to me","excerpt":"The actual product's just fodder, you see.   Well, now that I've solved the morale problems here,\\"   It's time to move on, that's perfectly clear.\\"   Then, as she waved goodbye and threw us a rose,   She said, \\"I love you all!\\" and our salaries froze!   She went off in search of her next job with glee,    Always ahead of the fallout is she.   With overtime banned, it was time we went home,   Defeated, downtrodden and numb to the bone.   The ride to the lobby was as quiet as before,   Just one day at work, nothing less, nothing more.   And we heard her exclaim, and so matter of fact,   \\"This place might be ruined, but my ego's intact.\\" Late to Work? Let Us Know!    You were helping an old woman cross the street, eh?

Elian Gonzalez has been living with relatives in Miami since he was rescued on Thanksgiving Day after floating at sea for two days strapped to an inner tube. His mother and 10 others died in the journey. His father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was said to have originally approved of the boy's remaining in Miami. But he and other relatives in Cuba have since said they want Elian returned to Cuba, tearfully accusing his ex-wife of having kidnapped the boy. Although many people in Miami argue that the boy's fate has already been decided by his mother's desperate act of taking to the open sea, the law would normally tend to uphold the father's custody rights as a surviving parent.

The children caper and gesticulate or simply gape","excerpt":"the adults, a few paces back, pay wholehearted attention or self-consciously pay none. There is authenticity, but there is also incitement. Part of what the camera sees it has created.Something like this happens in \\"Grey Gardens,\\" where the camera has been placed not in a backland settlement but in the decayed East Hampton, L. I., mansion of two lovely and tormented recluses. They are Edith Bouvier Beale, somewhere around 80, and her daughter Edie, in her mid-50's. They are the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Onassis.The two hidden and disabled lives, who have fashioned a littered, cat-infested carapace the same shape as themselves around themselves, are brought out for scrutiny by Albert and David Maysles, makers of some distinguished American documentaries.The cycle of attachment and tension, the cramped routines in the large, crumbling house, the regular scratching and salving of each other's psychic wounds: all these elements of a two-part relationship are made triangular. The camera is there, the Maysles stand behind it, and the effect is like that upon moths in a dark room when a light is switched on outside. They are instantly at the window, fluttering their wings.The stories of the two women come only blurrily to view in the film's 94 minutes of argument, reminiscence and halting, shifting monologues, which often go on simultaneously.Mrs. Beale, who is bent and feeble—the camera is unsparing of her old sagging flesh, draped in a sort of towel—is witty, fierce and the center of the household. She was once a great society beauty, was divorced when Edie was a child, fell ill and some 25 years ago brought Edie back to stay with her.Edie, who still has considerable beauty, seems the more deeply disturbed. She dresses in a strange costume that exposes most of her legs in black open-work stockings, keeps her head constantly covered with a tight hood and dances and sings disjointedly. She complains, sometimes confidentially to the camera, sometimes in brawling arguements, that her mother has chained her, driven away her lovers, ruined her life.Mrs. Beale rejoins that if Edie has stayed it was because she really didn't want to do anything else. \\"You never fell for a man,\\" she says. \\"France fell, but Edie didn't fall.\\" But at another point, something else breaks through: \\"I didn't want that child taken away. I'd be entirely alone.\\"The camera picks up relentlessly the litter of the house, the cats and raccoons nesting, the motionless world where two women sprawl side by side on beds, eating ice cream and liver paste, singing, posturing, bickering.And continually addressing the camera or rather, the microphone. They use it as a judge, an ally against each other and, in the case of Edie, as something more. \\"Darling David, where have you been all my life? Where have you been?\\" she calls out as she finishes a painful drum majorette routine. \\"All I needed was this man, David. David—I wish I'd had David and Al with me before this.\\"And all that comes back in response to this extraordinary unfolding by the two recluses is a quick view in the mirror of the Maysle's brothers, one at work on the camera, the other on the microphone. Or an occasional, perfunctory snatch of an answer delivered in the tone a doctor uses with a half-anesthetized patient.There is no doubt about the artistry and devotion that the Maysles have used in recording the life in \\"Grey Gardens.\\" There is no reason to doubt them when they say they love and admire the Beales. But the moviegoer will still feel like an exploiter. To watch \\"Grey Gardens\\" is to take part in a kind of carnival of attention with two willing but vulnerable people who had established themselves, for better or worse, in the habit of not being looked at.

Eight to 10 million Americans, most of them adults, face this distress daily. They suffer from what medical experts call bladder incontinence, the inability to prevent the release of urine at inappropriate times. Rather than risk public disgrace, many people, children and young adults among them, become social recluses.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu portrayed the decision as a way to ease a housing shortage. The Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, made no immediate statement, but other Palestinian leaders warned of potential violence should Israel go ahead with the project.   A1    French Blast European Body  The European Parliament, which meets in France, drew the rage of French officials when it criticized a French bill to crack down on illegal immigration. The Parliament, which has no power to legislate on immigration, called for the bill's withdrawal on the ground that it would require denunciations like the French were asked to make against Jews during the Nazi occupation. The bill was passed after the offending provision was eliminated.   A4    Swiss to Share Control of Fund  The Swiss Government agreed, after 18 months of talks, to share control of a Holocaust memorial fund with leading Jewish groups. The bulk of the fund would be distributed to Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe. The agreement, effective on March 1, follows months of pressure on the Swiss to accept responsibility for their policies during World War II.

A6    Koreans Divided on Apology  South Korea's President, Kim Young Sam, appeared to have won sympathy from the public by apologizing for a scandal that has engulfed his administration. A telephone poll showed that 49 percent of the public thought his apology was sincere, but only 30.5 percent said it would help resolve the scandal. Mr. Kim's next step is a shakeup of the Cabinet and the governing New Korea Party.

A1    . . . as Does a Former Aide  Harold M. Ickes, the former deputy White House chief of staff, defended the Administration's fund-raising practices but acknowledged missteps of his own. They included, he said, inadequate vetting of some contributors and White House visitors.

A18    Drug Labels May Be Simplified  The Government proposed simplifying the labels on over-the-counter drugs like pain relievers and cough syrups and making the type larger. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, said the new labels would help buyers ''choose the right medication and avoid harmful mistakes.''   A18    Dispute on Abortion Procedure  Advocates of abortion rights disputed a statement by the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, who said he had lied about the number of procedures of a particular form of late-term abortion.

A1    Bad News on City's Economy  New York City's economic performance lagged far behind the rest of the nation in 1996, despite higher bonuses on Wall Street and larger crowds of tourists, the city reported.

Young journalists who hadn't even been born when, at the age of 50, she closed her business and turned to teaching, come to interview her.

Vautrin is pleased by all this recognition but not hungry for it. Her attachment to the past is tenuous, maintained primarily by the cache of pieces she is unable to part with, stowed in her small apartment. In her mind, however, she has moved on to other things: to sculpture, which she took up when she turned 60, and lately to a book she has written -- a part philosophical, part historical, highly personal account of women's role in Western civilization.

During the campaign, officials forecast a small surplus in the $45 billion provincial budget. Barely a week after the election, they broke the news that there would be a $700 million deficit.

On the one hand, it is a dedicated attempt to do justice to one of America's best artists, who died in 1988 at the age of 75. The installation of 146 works, many of them never before shown, is generally successful, at times moving, and probably the first one to suggest the true complexity and scope of Bearden's achievement.   The catalogue, however, is another matter. It is self-important and mistake-ridden, and it has an insularity that Bearden's entire career was an argument against. In the introduction, Kinshasha Holman Conwill, the executive director of the museum, calls for a \\"long overdue canonization\\" and all but declares her museum the appropriate authority to carry it out. But the sloppiness and narrowness of the catalogue can only draw attention away from a remarkably complex and generous artist who should now be given the most concentrated consideration.

Given this array of talent it was hard indeed to choose a highlight from this gala program of highlights from the repertory of this unusual company, which now has a worldwide reputation.

Congress is in an uproar, the wavering White House is acquiring a new sense of direction, and the American voter may soon be treated to a real campaign.   The Democrats are acting like old-fashioned Democrats. \\"Soak the rich\\" - a phrase born in 1934 to blast F.D.R.'s embrace of Huey Long populism - is the new battle cry of suddenly unabashed liberals.   Having suckered President Bush into abandoning his no-tax firewall, Democrats have shifted the focus of the budget debate away from spending and onto the source of more taxes.   They call this \\"the fairness issue.\\" A central tenet of liberalism is government's guarantee that everyone, working or not, needy or not, is entitled to what politicians decide is a fair share of what the nation produces.   Republicans traditionally grumble that this classic, straightforward demagoguery encourages \\"class warfare,\\" turning rich against poor. They get defensive when charged with standing for vested property interests by opponents who claim to belong to \\"the party of the people.\\"   But these self-conscious conservatives miss the point of politics in an age of affluence. The fairness issue has been turned on its head. Most people think of themselves as closer to being rich than to being poor, and consider it unfair to carry all those unproductive others on their backs.   When these more-rich-than-poor Americans utter such sentiments, old-fashioned liberals deride them not only for being selfish but racist to boot. This swells the ranks of conservatives, because most voters are not so motivated and resent politicians who make them feel guilty.   Therefore, Republicans should not fear class warfare","excerpt":"the almost-rich far outnumber the almost-poor, and most of the people in the middle tend to identify with the almost-rich, whom they want to become.   Moreover, most people now know that the target of taxers has to be the middle-class pocket; squeezing the richies may be egalitarian fun but is not where the big money is.   What happens if you surtax millionaire incomes by 10 percent and add a 10 percent tax on furs, boats and jewelry, as the House liberals suggested? The budget deficit might be reduced by 2 percent, not counting the losses to the Treasury of taxes from people prevented from selling luxury items.   The hidden tax increase in that liberal budget proposal is to reinstate \\"tax bracket creep\\" - using inflation to automatically increase tax rates. That's $36 billion out of middle-class pockets for one year's creep; prevent indexing for five years, as would surely follow, and you achieve the liberal dream of \\"fairness\\" - redistributing income on a grand scale.   The Republican President, chastened by a whopping drop in support after waffling on the central promise of his campaign, says he would veto that bill. That fat and easy target will never reach his desk; Senate Democrats are taking a slightly more sober route of taxing booze and gas.   But whatever budget the Democratic Congress passes, its philosophical approach to the deficit will be new taxes in this \\"in\\" year and pious promises of reduced rates of spending in the \\"out\\" years. Tax now, cut spending later.   This liberal approach will pass over the objections of most of the Republican minority in Congress. Such dissent is healthy; if it means that the Government shuts nonessential services for a while, that will dramatize the depth of disagreement and bring the voters to the polls.   The only way the minority will become a majority is to draw an issue of principle. Within the Administration, Mr. Bush's Stolypin, Jack Kemp, soldiers on in loyal silence, but in Congress, the Republican minority must hold the Bob Packwood line on tax rates and align itself with the majority opinion in the nation. Where will it all end? Isn't compromise the name of the game?  The game's name is political purpose. Compromise should be struck after the will of the people has been expressed. Let Mr. Bush veto the taxation budget, let the Republicans uphold the veto, and let us use this election as a referendum on taxing vs. spending.   The current impasse is no cause for national embarrassment; on the contrary, it is the overdue surfacing of basic political difference.   A closed-down Government on Election Day would bring out anti-incumbent voters in force. Candidates, take your positions: tax and service reductions vs. tax and service increases.

The farther north we got, the more rustic the hostels were -- on two nights we had no electricity and on four nights, no running water -- which is why the van also had to stop at restaurants where passengers used the bathrooms to brush their teeth. Between hostels and ablution facilities, the van made stops for scenic overlooks, hiking trails, horseback riding, mountain biking and river rafting -- and, of course, every time someone saw a bear.

The remaining Hungarians, Karoly Schranz, second violinist, and Andras Fejer, cellist, have been joined by two Englishmen, Edward Dusinberre, first violinist, and Roger Tapping, violist.

In addition to his sheer newness on board, Mr. Tapping seemed far less extroverted than his colleagues, though a greater unity may come with time.   Schubert's Quartet in G (D. 887) generally cohered better than the Haydn.

The losses suffered by the Japanese in this activity were breathtaking. Every time the American bond market moved, it seemed, Japan lost a month's worth of trade surpluses. The American bond salesman could see this and, as a result, he was not so frightened by Japan's financial clout. Some part of him grasped that the Japanese were partly mad, and that their behavior doomed them to financial oblivion.    But to most Americans this was not so clear, perhaps because most Americans are predisposed to thinking of themselves as the innocents of global culture. When Japanese businessmen took to buying prime Manhattan real estate (Rockefeller Center!) and Hollywood studios (cultural heritage!) and famous golf courses (Pebble Beach!) the American reaction bordered on hysteria.

At the stand of the American publishers, the heaviest crush was for copies of a special bilingual catalogue printed for the exhibition, ''America Through American Eyes,'' with brief descriptions of the 312 books on display. These ranged from recent novels to works on sports, art and politics, and such Americana as the Sears, Roebuck catalogue. SOVIET BOOK FAIR OPENS, WITH U.S."},{"year":"1991","title":"A coalition of publishers, artists groups and the American Library Association has filed suit to challenge a new law that requires the keeping of records listing the ages and names of any models or actors used to depict sexual activity in books, film or videos.    The law, drafted by the Justice Department, was enacted by Congress last year and is to take effect next Wednesday. It is intended to discourage child pornography, according to its legislative sponsors.    But the plaintiffs, who sued in Federal District Court here on Friday, contended in court papers that the legislation, a revision of a law that was struck down earlier last year, was unconstitutional and would do nothing to reduce child pornography.   Rather, they contended, it would become an onerous burden on publishers and artists who deal with sexually oriented material involving adults.   The law would require, for example, that magazines and videos state that the producers have records with the ages and identities of the models or actors shown and that they say explicitly where the records can be inspected. Failure to maintain the records would be a felony.    Ann M. Kappler, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said it would be onerous for a magazine to have to ascertain the identities and ages of all the models used in its pages, even those clearly in middle age or older. Question of Responsibility     Maintaining such records would also be difficult for a freelance photographer who sold such pictures to a magazine, she said, and the law is unclear as to which of them, the magazine or the photographer, would be responsible for keeping the records.    Ms. Kappler said that the way the law was written suggested that \\"the Justice Department and Congress were trying to discourage the production and distribution of sex-oriented images of adults, an activity that is protected by the Constitution.\\"   Dennis Burke, counsel to Senator Dennis DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat who was one of the legislation's principal sponsors, said the aim of the requirement was \\"to make producers responsible for who they're using in their films, for example.\\"    He said the new law had been drafted to overcome problems that the earlier legislation encountered last year, when Federal District Judge George H. Revercomb ruled that it violated the Constitution's ree-speech guarantee.    Mr. Burke said that unlike the old law, the new one did not make a presumption that someone who failed to maintain the records was guilty of child pornography. He said it also made clear that distributors and retailers were not responsible for maintaining the records, only a producer or publisher.   But Ms. Kappler said that the vast majority of child pornography, which involves models or actors under 18 years of age and which her clients agree is abhorrent, was produced by an underground network that would be unaffected by the law.   Gordon Conable, an official with the American Library Association in Chicago, said, \\"The law creates so many burdensome restrictions that it will halt the production and distribution of mainstream books, magazines, motion pictures, photographs and medical texts.\\"   A hearing on the suit is scheduled to be held before Judge Stanley M. Sporkin on Monday, two days before the law is to take effect.    In addition to the library group, the 13 plaintiffs include Penthouse International Inc., which publishes Penthouse magazine","excerpt":"the American Booksellers Association, the American Society of Magazine Photographers and the International Periodical Distributors Association.

She had celebrated her 97th birthday on January 19th. She was born in Bethel, Pennsylvania in 1904. She taught first to third grades in a one-room schoolhouse in Berks County, PA. After graduating from Teachers College at Columbia University, NY in 1928, she taught in the Pelham and Geneseo, NY school districts. After her marriage to Joseph A. Zock, an investment banker, she moved to New York City where she worked with her husband for many years. She became a permanent resident of Sea Girt, NJ in 1965. She and her husband were two of the oldest members of the New York Stock Exchange. She was an active member of the Sea Girt Women's Club. During her fifty plus years of marriage, she and her late husband were very private donors to a wide variety of charitable causes and community betterment projects. She and her husband traveled the world extensively, whenever possible by ocean liner. They enjoyed many round the world cruises. She became an accomplished artist in her 70's. She read her beloved Wall Street Journal every day until three weeks before her death. After Joseph A. Zock's death in 1986, she increased her private philanthropic activities. She was the driving force and principal, but anonymous, benefactor in establishing the Sea Girt Public Library in 1991. It was not until her 95th birthday in 1999 that she allowed the town to honor her generosity. She has quietly and anonymously assisted the Tulpehocken, PA area school districts in educating many deserving students and contributed to school improvement projects. She also privately helped many less fortunate individuals throughout Monmouth County, NJ. Through the charitable trusts and private foundations created by Mrs. Zock and her late husband, significant annual contributions have been made to many and varied charities, educational institutions and local government projects. Besides her husband, Joseph A. Zock, she is predeceased by her sister, Mary Kurr Roberge. She is survived by a nephew, Dr. James K. Roberge, Lexington, MA, a grand-niece, Dr. Ann Roberge Cheal and grand-nephew, James D. Roberge and five great-grand nephews.
