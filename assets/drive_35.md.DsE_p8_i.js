There were moments when the stillness was such that a sigh might have been heard and at other times this tenseness was relieved by giggling and chuckling, mostly from youngsters, who were evidently grateful at being able to laugh at Chester Conklin's more or less frightening predicaments.It is another of those fantastic arrangements in which every door has its surprise and the characters invariably appear to be asking for trouble. Added to flashes of lightning, queer shadows and other camera stunts, there is in this up-to-date piece of spookery a variety of sounds, the dominating effects being booming thunder and a howling wind, so necessary to all mystery tales of haunted houses.The whole thing is well pictured, but whether it is interesting depends upon the individual. It is a muddled affair, even for its type. To give much of an idea of what it's about would destroy whatever suspense it may have for some persons. It can, however, be said that it deals partly with the importance of money. The supposedly dying request of an eccentric and, of course, wealthy man is not respected by his relatives, who are so eager to find the storage place of James Herbert's fabulously valuable securities.The fun in this fable is furnished by Mr. Conklin, as Mr. Rackham, and none other than Flora Finch as Mrs. Rackham. The difference between Mr. and Mrs. Rackham is that one of them is hopeful and afraid and the other is determined and scornful. Mr. Rackham is the weak sister of the two. It is he who cries for \\"Mamma,\\" a pet term he has for his wife, when he is caught in a passageway with ghostlike sounds and queer performances of doors and the furniture.Soon the haunted house appears to be crowded with a strange lot of peopel, including Mr. Herbert's grasping heirs, a wild-eyed, powerful man who has curious lapses into unconsciousness, and a beauteous sleep-walker. After seeing some of the people, Mr. Rackham would willingly have sold out for a song his interest in Mr. Herbert's estate.Thelma Todd is charming as the nurse. Mr. Conklin does well with his part, but he could be infinitely more amusing in a tale better suited to his talent as a comedian. Miss Finch is capital, never losing sight of the nature of the woman she is impersonating. Montagu Love is impressive in his role.One of the news reel bits depicts an elephant named Rosie playing golf. Rosie uses a putter for all shots. She occasionally misses the ball, but does not lose her temper. When she gets into a bunker, the footprints are so large that they really don't matter to the player following behind. Rosie heeds no cry of \\"Fore!\\" When Rosie puts she sometimes uses more force with her trunk than is necessary. Once, however, she sinks the ball. In the end, one can't be quite sure, but it looks as if she takes the ball for a real pill and swallows it, perhaps as a sign of having triumphed at the royal and ancient game.\\"Men Among Men,\\" a Vitaphone short feature, with strangely sub-dued voices, provokes no little merriment.

It seems that from  the time he built his first radio set \\"from glass tubes and a spool of lead,\\" George has been convinced that \\"the universe was soldered together with logic.\\"  So it isn't surprising that he reacts with \\"fatherly embarrassment\\" to his new junior office mate's revelation that she experiments with radio frequencies in order to listen for the dead. In fact, George knows that Niagara Spense, who is  partly deaf in one ear, has difficulty hearing many things. What is surprising -- most of all to George himself -- is that, despite his disbelief, Niagara inspires in him \\"a burning curiosity that had not flared in some 20 years.\\" And  in no time curiosity becomes obsession. When he awakens his wife, Judy, yelling, \\"Niagara,\\" she replies, \\"You had better be screaming about vacation.\\" For George, who has had no complaints or extramarital liaisons during his largely unexamined 16-year marriage, Niagara is an improbable love object. Ungainly, untidy and chaotic, she is the antithesis of Judy, \\"a Georgia brand of Southern  belle.\\" But Niagara's presence makes George aware of the fine line between contentment and stagnation. As he explains it, \\"If you leave a car parked long enough, the tires go flat and the battery won't hold a charge.\\" By the end of the novel, when Niagara and her research have enabled George to recapture a few  sparks, Ms. Zuravleff's insightful yet gentle rendering of the absurd has also allowed readers to connect fully with her quirky and endearing characters.

Because of its location across the street from the CBS studios, its shopworn rooms regularly filled with the game show's contestants. But new owners recently overhauled the place with a tongue-in-cheek barnyard sophisticate motif to draw a more cosmopolitan clientele, and it seems to be working. The revamped hotel is just quirky enough to be cool, while budget-minded enough to remain the (ahem) right price.    THE LOCATION  The 66-room hotel's best feature is its location, directly across the street from the popular Grove shopping mall and farmers' market and a short walk from the upscale boutiques of Third Street, the gustatory pleasures of Beverly Boulevard's restaurant row, and, yes, the CBS studios. Melrose Avenue and Museum Row are also close by.    THE SCENE  Although it's now luring stylish but budget-oriented young travelers, the Farmer's Daughter is still popular with ''Price Is Right'' contestants, making for an eclectic mishmash. The open-air lobby's colorful lounges are strewn with magazines like W and Black Book, right next to ''The Price Is Right'' promotional fliers and a shrine to Bob Barker with Polaroids of guests who were contestants. Somehow, the farmer moderne motif -- with pitchforks and wagon wheels bolted to the walls as art, turquoise gingham paint and contemporary rocking chairs -- pulls the two opposing cultures neatly together. That said, the whoops and laughter of game show contestants (especially as they return around dawn after waiting all night for tickets for that day's show) become annoying very quickly.    THE ROOMS  In a previous life, this was a Best Western, and that ancestry is still evident: Rooms are dark, low-ceilinged and thin-walled. But they are spacious and have been given cheerful yellow paint jobs and newly \\"weathered\\" wood floors. Walls are hung with framed snapshots of Shetland ponies and bunnies, rag rugs lay before the Adirondack chairs and the ceiling is camouflaged by (faux) pressed tin. The offerings may be bare bones -- the modest-size television sitting right atop the desk, the fridge empty of any minibar offerings -- but the personal touches of the decorator are evident and appealing. As for the king-size bed, it's comfortably firm, and although the linens are certainly not Frette (in fact, the quilt is denim) they are serviceably soft.    BATHROOMS  Again, think updated Best Western: The bathroom tile is cracked, but the combo shower-tub has been improved with a top-notch rain head shower and the sink gussied up with a quirky pump faucet. Water is hot, pressure is strong and the toiletries (from Lather) are high quality.    AMENITIES  Although rooms have few frills, each is stocked with pocket maps, trendy city magazines and a DVD player (a library of a few dozen contemporary films is available at the reception desk)","excerpt":"wireless Internet is available for $9.95 a day. Off the lobby is a compact pool. A request for fresh towels was delivered, within the minute, by the friendly receptionist himself.    MEALS  With no minibar and no room service, hungry guests have to venture to Tart, the just-opened restaurant that sits in the center of the hotel's courtyard and is already filling up with local scene setters. Although the décor here is still country, the fusion cuisine is definitely not: at $45, the filet of beef with Gorgonzola au gratin is almost half the cost of a room for the night, though breakfast, with omelets for $10 to $14 and grits for $4, is more reasonably priced.    THE BOTTOM LINE  Kitschy, charming, and (other than that the filet) cheap at $129 to $179 a night.The Farmer's Daughter, 115 South Fairfax Avenue, Los Angeles; 800-334-1658; www.farmersdaughterhotel.com.
