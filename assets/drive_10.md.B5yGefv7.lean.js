Though the scene is a bit tamer these days on the edge of Soho, certain quirky details of the past remain in the hotel, which opened last year. Iron bars separate the swooping lobby lounge from the hotel bar -- a sexy, black mica-floored space that also features three prison cells remade as private booths -- and nine suites in former judges' robing rooms. The other 103 rooms are in a new wing built on the site of the old police station. Clad in chic black uniforms, the young international staff is friendly, efficient and well schooled in the unusual history of the establishment.    THE LOCATION       Lively, cafe-lined Great Marlborough Street is in the thick of the theater and shopping districts. Carnaby, Regent, Oxford and Bond Streets form a warren of boutiques and department stores around the hotel. The Oxford Circus subway station is a few blocks away.    THE ROOMS       My standard room was modern and well lighted, with a flat-screen television, blond wood furniture tastefully accented with darker, coarser-grained wood and sleek metal handles, and a red sofa piled high with oversize pillows. The exceptionally cushy king-size bed was made up in crisp white Egyptian cotton sheets, perfect for chasing away jet lag. Everything seemed new except for the beige carpet, which was clean but stained in spots.    THE BATHROOMS       A partial glass wall separates the tub from the rest of the bathroom, which is outfitted with granite counters and tiles, Kempinski brand toiletries and white terrycloth robes.    AMENITIES       On the lower ground level, there is a small but well-stocked Thai-themed spa, Sanook, with a fitness center and a marble pool (open 7 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday, and 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekends","excerpt":"appointments are necessary for all facilities, including the gym equipment). In-room Internet connections are £14.99 (about $29 at $1.94 to £1) for 24 hours. I'd forgotten my AC adapter, and one was delivered to my room within 10 minutes (for a £10 deposit). There are five conference suites, and a business center is available by appointment.    ROOM SERVICE       Available 24 hours, with a limited menu of snacks and starters between 11 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. But it's worth the trip downstairs to the old sections of the courthouse to dine at one of the hotel's two restaurants. The Carnaby (heavy on brasserie-style steaks, soups and salads) takes up the front room, while Silk (Asian fusion -- try the excellent Thai red curry and litchi milk sorbet) is in the old courtroom itself, with a majestic domed glass roof filtering in natural light and the original counsel booths and benches serving as seating.    THE CROWD       Not as rambunctious as our fair rockers, but there are those who still know how to party. On a recent August evening, locals in smart business suits bellied up to the bar for an after-work drink, and a handful of American women shared a round of fruity cocktails. Designer-clad people met other designer-clad people in the lobby as a tanned Italian couple walked by, lugging small children and shopping bags.    BOTTOM LINE       A unique city hotel in a great location with an energetic bar and restaurant scene. And when other hotels are charging exorbitant rates during high season, you can still book online for Web specials (from £169 to £200) that include a Continental breakfast, served in the courthouse's original skylighted waiting room.
