Silence, especially among beings (God, for example) who have populated worlds of their own without offering the key to them, has occupied Bergman for a long time. This time, he populates the screen with a few of his own apparitions, some of whom — notably a 216-year-old lady with a parasol—are quite charming. Others are disgusting or terrifying. And then he himself is silent, or at least only raises the question, whether these characters exist or not. The movie begins with a black screen, and titles telling what it is about. (The written word becomes more and more important in films as it accustoms the eye incidentally to moving about the screen, instead of being passively receptive to it.) The story concerns an artist, Max von Sydow, who goes with his pregnant wife to a hut on an island—where he goes mad and vanishes, leaving his diary. The wife, played by Liv Ullmann, remains on the island and—in a very long monologue spoken directly to the audience—continues the story where the titles leave off. Then, the movie of their time together begins.Von Sydow's sanity is disintegrated under the pressure of an old erotic obsession, a real or imaginary memory of the murder of a small boy, the limitless tactlessness of some real or imaginary characters at a neighboring chateau, and the demons who—when he is painting, or at the hour of the wolf—appear to him. His wife, out of love, grows to share a little of his madness","excerpt":"some of his apparitions appear to her, too, and at the end of the movie she wonders whether her failure to accept all of them was a failure of love. With the ambiguity about whether the apparitions can be said objectively to exist or not—the camera, after all, presents them as ontologically there—the implication is that a failure to accept them would be a failure of responsiveness to Bergman on the audience's part.And it would. It takes great power for an artist to win through to the edge of madness, suicide, memory and guilt so continuously as Bergman does and come back with so much that seems familiar, out of an old dream or an old nightmare. Bergman works where people's nightmares converge. The-acting, of course, by Von Sydow, Miss Ullmann and Ingrid Thulin, as the object of his former love is too good to be apparent, and some of the images—the arrival by rowboat of Von Sydow and Miss Ullmann on the desolate shore of the island, Von Sydow running his hand over a naked body he believes to be a corpse, Miss Thulin's legs gradually appearing down from the upper left edge of the screen as she runs to meet him—are as memorable as anything from Bergman's earlier films. (The circus performer's rescue of his naked wife in \\"The Naked Night\\" and the procession in \\"The Seventh Seal\\" come to mind.)There is also a very eccentric kind of humor. Von Sydow, on his way to Miss Thulin, sees another character walk across a floor and up a wall. \\"It's only my jealousy,\\" the character says, \\"Please go away.\\" One scene, in which a lady dismantles her face when she takes off her hat, is very strongly repellent, and it might be a good idea to look away for a few seconds when it begins.\\"Hour of the Wolf\\" is not one of Bergman's great films but it is unthinkable for anyone seriously interested in movies not to see it.

The New York series began on Wednesday night with a performance of Verdi's \\"Oberto\\" in Central Park.   The value of this sort of endeavor depends on the case at hand. With a composer like Brahms, who edited his own work severely and maintained an astonishing consistency of inspiration, a complete-works survey is revelatory.

Yet \\"if there was uncertainty in those years,\\" Mr. Rios remarks, \\"there was also its opposite. It was the law of physics. . . . These were the constants from the realm of certainty: The seasons, the circus, a good dinner at the finish of a day. This was the gingerbread of living.\\" In that spirit, his stories acquaint us with the daily dramas of a tiny village in northern Mexico during the early decades of this century, a village of haunting characters whose circumscribed lives are filled with a gentle pathos. The 13 tales fold in and out of various chronologies and moods","excerpt":"some of the events we glimpse are slight, while others are clearly momentous. In one story, a coffin maker at work in the funeral home receives a terrible fright when a corpse sits upright. And in the title story, named for the gingerbread pigs that were a local delicacy, a young man becomes a baker in order to court his true love. Much of the drama in Mr. Rios's plotting hinges on misconceptions and the pervasive gossip so characteristic of villages everywhere, but the stories barely hint at psychology, wresting insight instead from the immeasurably deep traditions of folklore. The village, indeed, is a communal character, and Mr. Rios brilliantly conveys the potency of custom and censure in shaping its individual citizens. Part of the delight of his stories comes from their lyricism and part from their wisdom. Mr. Rios has a poet's eye and a storyteller's voice. He does not interpret, except to say: Here is life -- worth the living, worth the telling.\\nSANDRA SCOFIELD 'The Gingerbread of Living'"},{"year":"1931","title":"AS compared with the week just concluded, containing, as it did, the opening of the Whitney Museum of American Art  and of the Winter exhibition of the National Academy of Design, the week at hand promises to be rather lighter.

By Jim Murphy. Clarion. $18. (Ages 8 and up) There are many books about aspects of the 19th-century whaling industry, but this unusual and enthralling one is constructed around the diaries of some of the boys and young men who were eager for adventure and signed on to work as cabin boys or common seamen. It's a fascinating, sometimes terrifying narrative, aided by an extensive and helpful glossary. The illustrations include rare photographs and line drawings.    TRAPPED! Cages of Mind and Body. Edited by Lois Duncan. Simon & Schuster. $16. (Ages 12 and up) A chilling collection of original stories by well-known writers, including Lois Lowry, Francesca Lia Block, Walter Dean Myers, Gregory Maguire and others, that are sometimes alarming and often haunting.

How about being the only waitress at Ye Olde Pancake House during a rush hour that lasts forever?     SO FAR FROM THE SEA. By Eve Bunting. Illustrated by Chris K. Soentpiet. Clarion. $15. (Ages 5 to 9) The year is 1972, and Laura Iwasaki and her family, who are moving from California to Massachusetts, visit the Manzanar War Relocation camp and honor the memory of her paternal grandfather, a fisherman, who died there in 1943. Flashbacks, illustrated in black and white, explain Executive Order 9066 and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Laura leaves a meaningful gift at the grave site.     MONKEY SUNDAY: A Story From a Congolese Village. Written and illustrated by Sanna Stanley. Frances Foster/Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $16. (Ages 5 to 8) Luzolo's father is the village preacher, and she has promised she will sit still during his sermon because it is a special occasion. Tata Nkondi, an important elder, is coming to hear him preach at Matondo, a celebration of thanksgiving that takes place in a thatch shelter. It seems as if every animal in the village, from chicks to monkeys, interrupts her father, but Luzolo manages to sit still. It's the kind of cumulative-chaos story that's great fun to read aloud. The author was raised in Congo.    HARD BALL. By Will Weaver. HarperCollins. $15.95. (Ages 12 and up) Here's the third baseball novel about Billy Baggs, following ''Striking Out'' and ''Farm Team.''

She, of course, has been involved with his archrival since kindergarten. Romantic triangle, sexual tension, heroic athletes, young love.    MY MOTHER'S SECRET LIFE. Written and illustrated by Rebecca Emberley. Little, Brown. $15.95. (Ages 4 to 8) Things get out of control, what with the narrator breaking her mother's necklace after the cat and dog both behave badly. So Mother takes her own timeout, and finally the narrator dozes. To her surprise, Mother appears in her dream in an unexpected role. A deft reminder of life's complexities.     DUKE ELLINGTON: The Piano Prince and His Orchestra. By Andrea Davis Pinkney. Illustrated by Brian Pinkney. Hyperion. $15.95.

But just because you're visiting doesn't mean you have to drink (and pay) like some out-of-town sucker.     All you need to do is get a handle on the city's nearly endless happy hour options, which often feature great food specials as well as discount drinks","excerpt":"some of them are even available on Saturdays and Sundays. So, if a drizzly day happens to ruin your Central Park jaunt, you can drown your sorrows in something other than rainwater (and nearly as cheap). Afterward, seek out New York's two-tiered designated driver system: the guys in the yellow cars aboveground, and the subway conductors below.    HEDEH -- Third Street and its eastern continuation, Great Jones Street, is a pulsing happy hour vein that runs through the heart of Greenwich Village near New York University. There are $5 espresso martinis at Five Points, a $7 sorrel caipirinha (a cocktail in which Jamaica hugs Brazil) at Negril Village and the $4 burger-and-fries to go with your $4 Sam Adams beer at Groove. But Hedeh beats them all (happy hour, 5 to 7:30 p.m.) with its unusual drinks and quirky snack menu. Drinks appeal in their creativity, from the sake-tini, the margarita with yuzu fruit and the sake sangria (all $5 or less). Snacks include maki rolls or a seared tuna sashimi with onion soy dressing. The place, pretty expensive for dinner, is an affordable delight before or after. And, if you can ease into the table by the window on a warm evening, you'll wonder why people eat in the back at all.    SAPA -- This French-Vietnamese restaurant in Chelsea got one star from Frank Bruni of The Times in 2005 for a menu that has entrees in the $30 range. But during its seven-day-a-week 5:30-to-7:30 happy hour, you can get two drinks and a whole lot of appetizers for the same price. Sit either at the inviting bar or at the low-slung white cushioned seats in the lounge and take advantage of $5 martinis (the real gin or vodka kinds, not the litchi/raspberry/apple interlopers) and glasses of wine. Other highlights include a happy hour menu with items like the $2 oyster shooters: a shot glass with an oyster, sake and wasabi for those with rarefied tastes. Then there is the $4 bowl of barbecued pork wontons for the rest of us.    FIVES -- As most everyone knows since the remake of ''The Omen'' came out on June 6, repeated uses of the number 6 means you're dialing the devil's area code. What fewer people know is that repeated fives are associated with great deals on wine. Starting at 5 p.m. on all five weekdays, the Peninsula hotel at Fifth Avenue and 55th Street serves glasses of five different wines for $5 each. The subdued bar in the subdued hotel may not be so different from hotel bars in other cities, but it is a soothing place to relax after a late-afternoon check-in or a day of shopping on Fifth Avenue. There are also nice touches: a piano player, the bamboo toothpicks you use to pluck up the olives, chunks of Parmigiano-Reggiano and house-made candied walnuts that come at no extra cost. The wine selection changes weekly.    RINK BAR -- For those who prefer things a little more lively after their Friday afternoon adventures on Fifth Avenue, there's the outdoor bar on what is, in winter, the ice-skating rink at Rockefeller Center. During the winter holidays, people pay $25 (including skate rental) to glide beneath the world's most famous Christmas tree. But on a Friday night in summer, the same money will get you three $6 margaritas and two $4 Coronas, with change, from 5 p.m. till closing. (There are other drink specials on other weekdays, but none on Saturday or Sunday.) Though there's no tree, you can still stare up at the flags and the Rockefeller Center building, or gaze at a mixed crowd that is lively and unintimidating.    PAZZA NOTTE -- If Fives is too highfalutin and Rink too touristy, a deeper New York scene that bustles with very good-looking people drinking two-for-one $12 martinis is just blocks away (and just south of Central Park). The discount runs from 5 to closing every day, although Saturdays and Sundays lack that high-pheromone after-work edge. Martinis come in endless flavors, from white peach to litchi, but don't ask for two different flavors. Two-for-one means two-for-one, from the same shaker.    LOTUS CLUB -- The drink specials here from 4 to 7 p.m. essentially serve as transition hours from a bright, scone-loving-newspaper-reader-friendly daytime cafe to a bustling nighttime bar. Perfect if your group is split between those who want a great choice of $3 draft beers and those in need of a late-afternoon caffeine pick-me-up. You can even check your e-mail on the wireless network if, sadly, you have taken your laptop on vacation.

Ordinarily, Senate approval of nominees for such a small program - its $305 million budget would buy about a B-1 bomber and a half - is an unremarkable event. But none of Mr. Reagan's 14 previous nominees made it through confirmation. The President has been battling the program for some time. As Governor of California, he tried but failed to get the Nixon Administration to cut off the funding of a legal aid group that kept suing the state and winning. As President, he asked Congress in 1981 eliminate direct Federal legal aid funding, and made 30 ''recess appointments'' while Congress was out of session (the 11 directors confirmed last week received theirs in November 1984).

Nothing    was   going on, anyway - everyone knew that. In the 60's and 70's, as rumor had it, the continent was played out as a matrix of new ideas. The important action was in America, and artists, dealers, collectors and museum curators flocked from everywhere else to be part of it. But behold, by 1980, to general astonishment, European art had begun to claim our attention again.   Specifically, it was work by Germans and Italians that caused a stir - that of Anselm Kiefer, J\\"org Immendorff, Georg Baselitz, Sandro Chia, Francisco Clemente, Enzo Cucchi and others. They didn't come from nowhere","excerpt":"some of them were well established in Europe before they made it here, but at this time their art confirmed and enhanced the Neo-Expressionist figurative revival that was occurring on our shores.

It stood to reason, of course, that behind the output of the star Europeans, there was a body of work by lesser- knowns, and that the cultural assumptions of the art must also be reflected in other creative endeavors - architecture, photography, film and theater.

Ms. James's review is, unfortunately, a prime example of this phenomenon.   Although she begins on a sophisticated, world-weary note (\\"Madonna's book is less the display of an erotic imagination than a cliched catalogue of what the middle class -- her target audience, after all -- is supposed to consider shocking\\"), Ms. James soon exposes herself as a world-weary wannabe. The barely contained discomfort with which she deals with the lesbian and sadomasochistic imagery in Madonna's work establishes Ms. James as -- yes! -- a shocked member of the (presumably heterosexual and, to use her own terminology, \\"nonviolent\\") middle class. The most extreme moment occurs during Ms. James's defensive discussion of Madonna's \\"rough-edged fantasies,\\" in which the reviewer frantically seeks to dissociate herself from the material she has been given to review: \\"Of course, some of us actually like the opposite sex","excerpt":"some of us believe it is possible to have great sex without whips, third parties or domestic pets.\\" Fine.

Despite running for 11 months at the Barrow Street Theater, though, the $200,000 production barely broke even, only collecting its first dollars in the black -- and there weren't many of them -- in its closing weeks in January 2005. It's a phenomenon that is all too familiar to commercial producers Off Broadway, which has been in a protracted slump in the last couple of years. ''It's a constant struggle to justify the business,'' said Scott Morfee, one of the ''Bug'' producers. But what exactly makes the business so tough? Well, expenses, which keep growing, and audiences, which don't. ''Bug'' cost about $34,000 a week to run","excerpt":"some Off Broadway productions cost twice that. Mr. Morfee and his partners kept expenses down a number of ways, including managing the show themselves and staging it at the Barrow, where Mr. Morfee holds the lease. To show how hard it can be to make a go of it, Mr. Morfee took the rare step of opening his books on ''Bug''; the figures at right are averages taken from several different weeks during the run. They include some one-time costs -- like the opening-night cast party -- amortized over the show's 11-month run. And while this is an average week, ''Bug'' broke even with the help of some sell-out weeks, when the profits were greater than those shown here. In the end, ''Bug'' sold about $2 million worth of tickets and cost about $2 million to run. All of which leaves Mr. Morfee a little bemused.
