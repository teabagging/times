Reports from aid workers and anecdotal evidence suggest significant increases in death rates, school dropouts and malnutrition. Some experts say that the legacy of the crisis will be felt long after the region's economies are purring again.   A1    Tale of Two Cities in Italy  Pompeii, the famed Italian town that holds both ancient ruins and a religious shrine, is expecting an infusion of money and visitors as the millennium approaches. But the prospect is inflaming a longstanding rift between two sides of the town -- one crawling with tourists, guides, and archeologists, and the other where the unemployment rate is 30 percent and stray dogs sleep in the sun.   A4    Serb Leader Allows Observers  President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has agreed to allow diplomatic observers to enter and move through the province of Kosovo, where Serbian troops and policemen have been attacking the ethnic Albanian majority, senior Administration officials said. In Kosovo, members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said Serbian troops were removing bodies from areas observers might visit and concealing other evidence of their attacks.   A3    Swiss Reject Research Limits  Swiss voters decisively rejected a ballot measure to place broad restrictions on biomedical and other research involving genetically modified animals.   A6    Mexican Labor Strengthens  A modestly successful strike by Mexican flight attendants suggests that after nearly two decades of falling wages some workers want to lodge more aggressive demands.   A6    Bomb Kills 23 on Pakistan Train  A bomb exploded on a crowded railroad train in southern Pakistan, killing 23 people, and the Pakistani Government immediately blamed Indian secret agents. The Pakistani Minister of information, Mushahid Hussain, said his Government would provide ''hard proof'' of Indian involvement. Indian officials denied the accusation.   A5    NATIONAL   A10-19    National Rifle Association Opens Publicity Offensive  Weary of being seen as an extremist, right-wing organization, the National Rifle Association is going on the offensive with the expected election of Charlton Heston as its next president and a slick new advertising campaign that is starting later this month. The country's largest gun-owners' organization contended at its annual convention in Philadelphia that lazy prosecutors, lenient judges, gratuitous television violence and irresponsible parents cause more problems than guns.   A1    High Temperature Records Fall  The White House will announce that according to an analysis by Government scientists, El Nino joined the continuing warming trend to break global temperature records in each of the first five months of 1998.   A1    Abortion Report is Rejected  A team of Rutgers University researchers hired by New Jersey to examine the effects of the state's new welfare policy found that it has contributed to an increase in abortions, but the state has rejected the findings, and asked for revisions of the report.   A10    Western Manhunt Scaled Back  The police reopened the town of Bluff, Utah, to outside traffic and said they would cut back their search for two armed fugitives suspected in the killing of a police officer.   A10    Senator Sees Chinese Plot  The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said that testimony to the panel last week in closed session showed that the Chinese Government had planned to influence the 1996 election. But Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, added that it remained unclear whether the efforts were carried out.   A14    Religious Leaders Lobby Clinton  From Tibetan Buddhists to Roman Catholics to evangelical Christians, a broad array of religious leaders is urging President Clinton to press the Chinese Government to end the repression of believers there.   A17    A Boon to Florida G.O.P.  Since 1995, when Florida's Democratic governor sued major cigarette companies, the tobacco industry has contributed $592,000 to the Florida Republican Party, more than twice what it gave to the state's Democrats. The industry also sprinkled donations among friendly state legislators, many of whom opposed Florida's lawsuit.   A16    Families Bear a Big Share Of Cost of Care for Elderly  Some elderly people and their families are being caught in the gap between the costs of long-term care and the limited amount of Government aid to pay for it. Fedele Capozzi, 85, sold his house in Philadelphia and recently exhausted his saving paying for care for his wife, Elvira, who is 83 and has Alzheimer's disease.   A18    NEW YORK   B1-12    Giuliani Policy Will Force Disabled Mothers to Work  In an ambitious and controversial effort to boost the number of welfare recipients participating in New York City's workfare program, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will soon begin requiring physically and mentally disabled mothers to work for their welfare checks. The new policy began quietly this weekend.   A1    Insurance an Issue for Pataki  The high cost of auto insurance, an issue that nearly cost Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey her job last year, appears on the verge of becoming a major theme in New York's campaign for governor, with Democrats blaming Gov. George E. Pataki for high rates.   B1    Juror Talks of Death Sentence  One of the jurors who concluded that Darrel K. Harris should be the first man sentenced to death in the city since 1963 said she reached her decision after turning to her Bible.   A1    The constitutionality of the state's untested 1995 capital punishment law and what the defense considers a judge's flawed conduct of the murder trial of Darrel K. Harris will be the focus of his appeal, his chief trial lawyer and legal experts said.   B4    'Lion King' Wins Tony  ''The Lion King,'' a daring mix of experimental techniques with a familiar story that was a critical success and a smashing financial one for the Walt Disney Company, won the Tony Award for best musical. ''Art,'' a three-character comedy about Parisian men whose disagreement over a Minimalist painting jostles loose half-buried fissures in their friendship, won the Tony for best play.

But the television industry is now conceding that most people who buy one of these expensive new sets may face considerable difficulty actually seeing the new crystal-clear programming, because the first digital sets will be incapable of receiving it via cable.
