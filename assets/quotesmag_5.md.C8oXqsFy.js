Hardly. But that's the way it was. And as a result, one of the highlights of 1981 turned out to be the celebration of Bela Bartok's centenary. Some of the celebrating, predictably, was perfunctory enough - we were awash for awhile in performances of the Concerto for Orchestra and we had not one but two mediocre concert versions of the opera ''Bluebeard's Castle.'' But the six string quartets, which had seemed to be slipping from the repertory in recent years, were brought back by several ensembles that clearly believed in their vitality and lasting significance.

''When they learned that we were planning a 50th anniversary sale, a number of valued clients asked if they could be a part of it,'' he related. The result is a sale with so many outstanding coins that they could have been used to stock three first rate auctions.

Illustrated. 430 pp. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. $17.95. PICTURE the skinny teen-age boy, blind, self-conscious with ambition, cramped in a musty broom closet - his mildewed, cobwebbed room of his own - dreaming of Shakespeare. ''Oh, my yearning is simply to become like this great man,'' he types in his journal (a journal he will never be able to read himself). ''I know that's impossible. But if one aims one's arrow at the sky, it will at least get to the top of the trees.''   There is something sweetly heroic about the boy in his broom closet as he painstakingly transforms the tiny, bare room (''close as a coffin'' and smelling of Ajax) at the Arkansas School for the Blind into a writer's studio, an electronic refuge stocked with typewriter, radio-phonograph, tape recorder, Talking Book player and earphones. There's something poignant about the young high school student from India, desperate for news of a world beyond Little Rock, excitedly recording and replaying Edward R. Murrow's daily broadcasts as a charm against his own isolation, ''almost like a boy on the moon.'' But youthful egotism, however delightfully expressed, can become a bit tiresome","excerpt":"announced ambition, however naive (''I would also like my views to be known widely - all over the world''), soon loses its appeal.
