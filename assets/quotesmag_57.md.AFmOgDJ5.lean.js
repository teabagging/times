Tears, both crocodile and glycerine, filled the screen in sodden close-ups, and during the course of the story almost every member of the cast had a good cry. Wynne Gibson was the mother and she played it to an advanced age without cracking a smile. It is one of the cardinal cinema rules that an actress, before stepping into the first line, must first prove her ability to wear a white wig, heavy lines under the eyes, and an expression denoting frantic concern over the whereabouts of her son. If an addled midnight memory is still functioning, this is Miss Gibson's second try and she is still doing it very well.Miss Gibson in the new film is a sacrificial wife whose husband deserts her while she is in a family way. She thereupon goes to live with a kindly art instructor who is secretly but nobly in love with her. After the baby is born, the no-good husband returns and Miss Gibson wallops him over the head with a bronze entitled \\"Ambition.\\" After serving ten years in the penitentiary for her indiscretion, she returns to the home of Paul Lukas, her benefactor, and discovers that her son believes that his mother is dead. Rather than disillusion him she ploughs off into the night. The camera picks her up many years later in Paris, where she is selling flowers and taking unhappy swigs at a bottle that might contain absinthe. Like so many cinema mothers, she doesn't appear to enjoy it very much. Now here comes the dramatic thunderbolt of the story in the person of a young man who asks her to pose for him. The temptation to reveal the identity of the young man is almost irresistible, but it will have to be suppressed out of courtesy to Vicki Baum, who wrote \\"Grand Hotel\\" and who also is credited with \\"I Give My Love.\\"It seemed unlikely at an advanced hour last night that there would be many takers for \\"I Give My Love.\\" In its energetic efforts to shake the auditorium with sobs, it succeeds chiefly in producing a rather self-conscious state of ennui. Motherhood is about as sacred a theatrical cow as there is, and it is necessary to emphasize, while finding \\"I Give My Love\\" a pretty foolish example of film drama, that motherhood is still all right. But it does seem to have had more than its share of bad luck with the film writers.

Like the director's earlier works, including his 1975 play \\"Dead Class,\\" which was revived at La Mama this month, \\"Today Is My Birthday\\" presents a surrealistic evocation of his country's war-torn history that unfolds as a succession of hallucinatory tableaux, all done in somber shades of ash. But \\"Today Is My Birthday\\" was also to have been a more literal self-portrait in which the director, sitting at a table and gazing at a framed photo of his family, conjured up personal visions of the past.

Kantor's early opus, \\"The Dead Class,\\" returned this week to La Mama to reintroduce theatergoers to the work of this icon of experimentalist drama. The director died in December and his company, Cricot 2, is carrying on his work. In the company's previous visits to the United States, all of them at La Mama, Kantor was himself integral to the performance. A brooding totemic figure, he appeared onstage with his actors, serving as conductor, stagehand and silent watchman. His presence added an immeasurable dimension to the theatrical experience.

However, since artists of his type can attract vast amounts of money, let them donate their excess to artists of a more serious, traditional bent.    I find it offensive that Ms. Gilman labels symphonies crowd pleasers, when they are traditional mediums of culture proved by their longevity.

Last week, KPMG reached an agreement with the government that headed off an indictment of the firm itself. As part of the agreement, which is expected to be announced today, the firm would acknowledge wrongdoing, a move that will bolster prosecutors' case against the former KPMG partners and others.     Last week's settlement is a victory of sorts for KPMG and vindication for its legal team, led by Robert S. Bennett of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom. But the willingness of prosecutors to file criminal charges against former partners at the accounting firm may portend a new toughness in enforcing the rules governing complex and lucrative tax strategies. [Page C1.]    Auditor of Hedge Fund Had Ties to Bayou Group  Investors who are worried about the fate of the money they turned over to the Bayou Group, a Connecticut firm that is under investigation by federal and state authorities, will not be happy to learn that there were close ties between the firm and the auditor of its hedge funds. Public documents show that the chief financial officer and head of compliance for the Bayou Group was also a principal in an accounting firm that audited the hedge funds' books. [C1]    Taking In a Sunday Sermon on the IPod  Kyle Lewis, 25, missed going to church one Sunday last month. But he did not miss the sermon. Mr. Lewis, who regularly attends services of the National Community Church in Alexandria, Va., listened to the sermon while he was at the gym, through a recording he had downloaded to his iPod. Instead of listening to the rock music his gym usually plays, he heard his pastor's voice. His church started the podcasts last month. [C6.]    Martha Stewart Has a New Strategy: Martha Stewart  Two years after trying to scrub Martha Stewart the person out of Martha Stewart the brand, Martha Stewart the business has a new strategy: Martha Stewart every day. Ms. Stewart will be free of her court-mandated monitoring bracelet on Wednesday, but the end of her sentence does not mean that she, or her company, are guaranteed success. Ms. Stewart will remain on probation for 18 months for her conviction on charges of lying to prosecutors about a stock sale. Moreover, her postprison appeal as an avatar of taste is untested, and the company's stock is overvalued by the estimates of almost every analyst. [C1.]    A New Ad Every Weekday for New York Magazine  Almost eight years after its last advertising campaign, New York magazine plans to start one that will change five days a week. The centerpiece of the campaign, which carries the theme ''This is New York,'' will be scores of posters that are to be replaced each weekday at five subway stations in Manhattan. Many of the posters, scheduled to appear from Friday through Sept. 30, will be related to events of the day or week they are to run. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C7.]    A Hand-Held Gaming Device With Many Talents  As a hand-held gaming device, it sounds more like a Swiss Army knife. It can play video games, movies and music files","excerpt":"take photos; wirelessly send and receive text messages and e-mail; display Web pages; and function as a navigation and tracking unit. A built-in gyroscope can alter the viewing angle of a game as the player turns the device around. It is called Gizmondo, and it is scheduled to arrive in the United States in the fall. But delivering such an ambitious product has not been without setbacks. [C4.]    Stumbles for U.S. Media Companies in China  Last June, Yu Youjun, the executive deputy governor of Hunan Province, met with Sumner N. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom. Viacom, like many American media companies, is already active in China. Mr. Redstone and Mr. Yu discussed co-productions between Viacom's MTV International and Chinese companies. But the optimism of Western media companies about venturing into the Chinese market has taken several hits recently. Earlier this month, China's Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Culture and four other regulators published new rules that further restricted foreign film and television makers. This week, News Corporation's plan for a television channel to be co-owned with a Chinese company was quashed by the government. [C1.]    AOL Adds Ticket Sales as a Service  Though they have claimed the mantle of respectability since they jumped online in the late 1990's, ticket scalpers have not been able to shake their reputation as hustlers out to make a quick buck on sold-out shows. But with America Online, which has opened its Ticket Marketplace service, joining them, can legitimacy be far behind? E-Commerce Report: Bob Tedeschi. [C4.]    News that New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's office had reached a settlement with America Online requiring it to ''remove obstacles consumers face when seeking to switch or cancel service,'' suggests that breaking up with AOL is hard to do. Link by Link: Tom Zeller Jr. [C3.]    An Initiative to Change the Roots of the Internet  The National Science Foundation is planning an initiative that is intended to re-engineer the Internet and eliminate the shortcomings of today's global network, creating a network more appropriate to a computerized world a decade from now. The project, which has not yet received financing and may cost more than $300 million, is intended to include both a test facility and a research program. [C2.]    Shape Magazine Puts Elizabeth Hurley in Spotlight  Magazines often blur the line between advertising and editorial content, and the September issue of Shape is a prime example. In what Barbara Harris, the editorial director, calls ''synergy,'' the magazine's cover shows Elizabeth Hurley, the actress, model and swimsuit designer, in one of her own bikinis. In addition, ''Ms. Hurley's cover look'' consists almost entirely of products from EstÃ©e Lauder. Ms. Hurley has long been a model for EstÃ©e Lauder, which also bought the inside cover of Shape for a two-page advertisement.
