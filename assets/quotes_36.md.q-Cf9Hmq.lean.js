The purpose of the S.A.T. is to predict college performance. The meaning of \\"discrimination\\" on a test of this sort is a failure of the test to predict the college performance of the group discriminated against as well as it predicts the performance of the group it favors.   It is simple to demonstrate such discrimination when it exists. It is impossible to demonstrate such discrimination on the S.A.T. because the S.A.T. is every bit as successful at predicting the performance of minority groups as it is at predicting the performance of the majority group.   Those who claim discrimination avoid the simple measures to expose discrimination if it existed. They offer theoretical explanations, emphasizing, for example, that some questions demand that baseballs be added or yachts be priced, questions invoking entities that are allegedly so foreign to women and the poor that these groups are at a disadvantage in answering the questions.   But not only does the S.A.T. predict college performance as well for minorities, but the minorities: (a) do as well on the allegedly biased questions as on other questions, and (b) give the same rank ordering of difficulty of questions as the allegedly favored group gives.   To make these points with an absurd example: if all colleges decided to give all their courses in Spanish, Hispanic students would get far better grades than other students. The S.A.T. would switch from questions in English to questions in Spanish (to reflect the new advantage that speaking Spanish gives college students), Hispanic students would do better on the S.A.T. than any other group, and the S.A.T. would maintain its impressive record of prediction.   One could well argue that it would be ridiculous for American colleges to switch to Spanish, but not that the S.A.T. becomes discriminatory when it alters the language of the test to reflect the college language change.   If differences in group college performance are eradicated, then group differences on the S.A.T. will also be eradicated.

The process has been made somewhat easier because some of the candidates were previously considered for the two governor slots recently filled by Wayne D. Angell and Manuel H. Johnson.   Although the talent scouts have not publicly identified the leading candidates, it is increasingly evident that the early White House mention of Beryl W.

This was summed up by John Kenneth Galbraith, the American economist, who said: ''The clear implication is that the artist, the person concerned with artistic endeavor, must show an assertiveness in fields that are not his or her own.''   ''Just as war is too important to be left to the generals, so is an economic crisis too important to be left to the economists or the 'practical men,' '' he said.

Lethem's melancholy and marvelous novel elegizes a slice of urban life in 1970's Brooklyn. The coming-of-age of geeky Dylan Ebdus (who seems to be Lethem's alter ego) and his hip black neighbor, Mingus Rude, is stuffed with cultural touchstones: from comic books, popular music and graffiti to crack cocaine and gentrification. Selected by the Book Review editors as one of the best books of 2003, ''Fortress'' is ''crowded . . . with lessons, insights, facts, dates, song titles and minor characters,'' A. O. Scott wrote here, ''and the naturalistic geography of a borough Lethem knows like the back of his hand is illuminated by a daub of magic realism.''    ALL THE STOPS: The Glorious Pipe Organ and Its American Masters, by Craig R. Whitney. (PublicAffairs, $17.95.) This engaging history of the American pipe organ -- and the colorful characters who devoted their lives to its music -- also explains the metaphor that gives the book its title (the ''stops'' are knobs on the keyboards that control a variety of sounds). Whitney, an assistant managing editor at The Times and an amateur organist, ''manages to slip in a good deal of technical and historical information'' that makes for ''enthralling reading,'' Peter Williams said in these pages in 2003.    STILLNESS: And Other Stories, by Courtney Angela Brkic. (Picador, $13.) Set in Yugoslavia during its violent dissolution, the stories in this debut collection are morally complex, filled with the courage and contradictions of life in wartime. Brkic, a Croatian-American, interviewed refugees in Croatia and worked as a forensic archaeologist in Bosnia","excerpt":"such experience explains ''the passion and conviction she has brought to this spare and poignant book,'' Francine Prose said here last year.    GENTLEMAN REVOLUTIONARY: Gouverneur Morris, the Rake Who Wrote the Constitution, by Richard Brookhiser. (Free Press, $14.) Brookhiser, an accomplished historian and biographer, resurrects one of the more obscure -- and mercurial -- founding fathers: Gouverneur Morris, the one-legged, philandering genius whose achievements include drafting the Constitution and designing New York City's street grid. ''Brookhiser's Morris is the Revolution's Falstaff,'' Carol Berkin wrote here last year.    A PEOPLE ADRIFT: The Crisis of the Roman Catholic Church in America, by Peter Steinfels. (Simon & Schuster, $15.) ''Today the Roman Catholic Church,'' Steinfels writes in this thoughtful analysis, ''is on the verge of either an irreversible decline or a thoroughgoing transformation.'' The author, the ''Beliefs'' columnist and a former senior religion correspondent for The Times, places the sex abuse scandal in a larger context and traces the church's crisis to a vacuum of leadership. ''His balance makes all the more unsettling the harsh conclusions he draws,'' Garry Wills wrote in The Times last year. David Gibson, a former correspondent for Vatican Radio, also sees the church at a crossroads. In THE COMING CATHOLIC CHURCH: How the Faithful Are Shaping a New American Catholicism (HarperSanFrancisco, $14.95.), he argues that the scandals have galvanized the country's rank-and-file Catholics, ushering in a positive transformation. R. Scott Appleby, writing for the Book Review in 2003, said the book was marked by ''incisive observations, a playful wit and a passion.''    AMERICAN WOMAN, by Susan Choi. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) Choi's subtle, mesmerizing second novel, spun from the intersection of the radical activist Wendy Yoshimura with the fugitive Patty Hearst, examines American idealism amid the domestic turmoil during the Vietnam War. The book, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, ''takes us straight into one of the strangest segments of our ever-surreal American dream life,'' Sven Birkerts said here last year.    NINE HILLS TO NAMBONKAHA: Two Years in the Heart of an African Village, by Sarah Erdman. (Picador, $14.) This earnest diary describes Erdman's efforts as a Peace Corps volunteer to bring better health care and AIDS education to a Muslim village in Ivory Coast. As she confronts poverty and fatalistic superstitions, ''Erdman's irrepressibility lofts you along,'' Craig Seligman wrote here in 2003.

There's no need to make the long journey to Spain or Mexico.All the raw excitement of the bullring that anyone could normally require, plus a wealth of the color and drama in the life of a young torero, may be had for the price of a theater ticket and the usual subway fare, from Francesco Rosi's stunning bullfight film, \\"The Moment of Truth,\\" which came to the Fine Arts yesterday.Never have I seen a motion picture that so clearly and unrelentingly shows the whole brutal, bloody business of the killing of bulls in the ring as does this virtual documentary, which has as its star young Miguel Mateo Miguelin, one of the leading bullfighters of Spain.And never have I got such a message of the cruelty of the sport as is conveyed in this film, which owes much of its excitement to superb color photography.Signor Rosi, the Italian director who is barely known over here from his \\"Salvatore Giuliano,\\" which was shown at the New York Film Festival last year, has packed his picture with such details of the elaborate bullfight ritual, from the brilliant entrance into the arena of the cuadrilla to the gruesome dragging away of the dead bull, that anyone who has seen a bullfight will see more here than he has ever seen before and anyone who hasn't seen a bullfight will probably determine forever to be excused.Such dazzling displays of capework by the splendidly dressed matadors, especially by the handsome Miguelin, who is as stunning as any working movie star","excerpt":"such flashing leaps of the banderilleros, such crunching struggles by the horse-borne picadors and such absolutely horrifying slaughters of great, gory, death-resisting bulls, standing there with their heads down, defying the plunge of the swords, have never been shown in movies. And such vivid footage has never—at least, to my knowledge—been so spectacularly and excitingly edited.As an exposition of the bullfight—of death in the afternoon, with beasts and humans sweating and suffering while the throbbing crowds whistle, hoot and cheer—there has not been a more impressive picture than \\"The Moment of Truth.\\"It does have its flaws. There are lapses. Some of the shots in the sequences do not match. And more emphasis is placed upon the close-ups of animal slaughter than upon the artistry of the matadors. But never mind; it is honest, and as vibrant as such a film can be.The corrolary story of a young bullfighter's rise from peasant boy in Andalusia to the backroom of a Barcelona cafe, where he learns the first twists of bullfighting, to his first big fight in Madrid and then on through his tasting the fruits of triumph to his ironic death, is conventional. We have seen it in several bullfight films. But here it is brightly documented and quite realistically portrayed.Miguelin is extraordinarily able in the scenes in which he has to act—a lithe and fluid fellow he achieves sharp emotional variations in his face. From a lad against the lovely pastel landscape of grain-growing Andalusia to a man, full of fear and cynicism, in a Santa Cruz de Tenerife hotel room, he is thoroughly plausible and moving.And when he tackles Linda Christian in one scene of love-making at a cocktail party, he outdoes any star in Hollywood.Pedro Basauri Pedrucho as his agent and José Gomez Sevillano as a bullfight impresario are as rugged and real as the great animals that charge valorously into the ring. All the crowds in the streets, the priests and mummers that put on a religious parade, and everyone else, is thoroughly Spanish. So is the film, though it has dubbed Italian dialogue with English subtitles. Never mind that. Olé!

While that attempt proves quixotic, there's exhiliration to be found in the wild, go-for-broke risks taken and the sporadic battles won. This is a show in which nearly every scene is either a rhymed rap recitation or a mock- burlesque sketch, in which realistic events dissolve suddenly into phantasmagoric comic japes, in which the cast gets about by stylized, leapfrogging movement rather than by conventional means of walking or dancing.

An outsiderish literary stance is traditional","excerpt":"such masterpieces as \\"Moby-Dick\\" and \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" deal with marginal situations and eccentric, rootless characters; many American writers have gone into exile to find subjects of a congenial color and dignity. The Puritanism and practicality of the early settlers imposed a certain enigmatic dullness, it may be, upon the nation's affective life and social texture. The minimization of class distinctions suppressed one of the articulating elements of European fiction, and a close, delighted grasp of the psychology of sexual relations -- so important in French and English novels -- came slowly amid the new world's austerities. Insofar as a writer can take an external view of his own work, my impression is that the character of Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom was for me a way in -- a ticket to the America all around me. What I saw through Rabbit's eyes was more worth telling than what I saw through my own, though the difference was often slight; his life, less defended and logocentric than my own, went places mine could not. As a phantom of my imagination, he was always, as the contemporary expression has it, there for me, willing to generate imagery and motion. He kept alive my native sense of wonder and hazard.\\n\\nA writer's task is not to describe his work but to call it into being. Of these four related novels, I know principally -- and that by the fallible light of recollection -- what went into them, what stimuli and ambitions and months of labor. Each was composed at the end of a decade and published at the beginning of the next one; together they became a kind of running report on the state of my hero and his nation, and their ideal reader became a fellow American who had read and remembered the previous novels about Rabbit Angstrom. At some point between the second and third, I began to visualize four completed novels that might together make a single coherent volume, a mega-novel. Now, thanks to Everyman's Library, this volume exists, titled, as I had long hoped, with the name of the protagonist, an everyman who, like all men, was unique and mortal.

There is now also a new attention to what the Harvard professor of government Samuel P. Huntington has called the clash of civilizations: thus Islam and the West are seen as irreconciliably at odds.

After a hearing at which the lawyers argued only about the length of a prison term, the judge decreed death.    Yesterday, the Supreme Court called that a denial of due process of law and sent the case back for resentencing. As Justice John Paul Stevens noted, while the lawyers argued over the length of the sentence, \\"the silent judge was the only person in the courtroom who knew that the real issue they should have been discussing was the choice between life and death.\\"    The high court's decision was eminently just. But it contained an alarming feature: the close 5-to-4 vote. The dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia said the decision \\"creates a vast uncertainty in the law,\\" and a new defense for any accused person to raise.
