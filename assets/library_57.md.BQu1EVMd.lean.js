That would be plenty of work for most musicians, but it isn't enough for Mr. Ocasek, who is in his mid-30's and who has been playing and singing in rock bands for well over a decade.   He recently completed a solo album called ''Beatitude'' for Geffen Records that features little-known musicians from various East Coast new wave bands and sounds strikingly unlike the Cars. And he now intends to make a new solo disk, as well as a new Cars album, every year.   ''Sure, I'm busy,'' Mr. Ocasek said cheerfully the other day. ''Why not? Basically, there's just a lot I want to get done and these days so many things are happening that you don't expect and have no control over. If someone can walk out in the street and shoot John Lennon, somebody can launch a nuclear attack. It's scary. But you start to take it in stride after a while.

says present system, because of wide variations in service provided by 3 major religious groups, leads to discrimination against Protestant children and de facto racial discrimination, since most blacks are considered Protestant; says that while Jewish agencies can provide for many non-Jewish children beside their own and Catholic agencies fall only slightly short of providing for all Catholic children, Protestant agencies can provide foster care for only 1/2 of Protestant children in need of it;
