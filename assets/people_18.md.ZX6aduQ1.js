Waiting lists go from a few months to a year for appointments with many of the high-end stylists of the moment -- John Sahag, Garren at Henri Bendel's, Kim Lepine, Steven Knoll and Mr. Fekkai. \\"High-end hair is making a comeback,\\" said Charles Booth, owner of the Madison Avenue salon La Coupe for 30 years. Ms. Stewart said: \\"Everything is competitive in New York. Great hair may just give you the edge. It makes you think you will do better in the dating market, in the workplace.\\" High-end hair fits the style of the 90's, in which people express affluence in relatively subtle ways, said Annemarie Iverson, the beauty and health director at Harper's Bazaar. \\"A haircut,\\" she says, \\"is a quiet way to express wealth.\\" The hair salons are capitalizing on the trend. Frederic Fekkai in a joint venture with Chanel, is taking his business, along with his high-profile clientele (like John F. Kennedy Jr. and Christie Brinkley), from a half-floor space at Bergdorf's to a five-story \\"town house in the sky\\" in the Chanel building at East 57th Street in mid-August. On Thursday afternoon at his present salon, while Ms. Stewart sat drying her toes, lines of women walked by, in the latest Prada bags and Gucci loafers, waiting for their appointments. There was almost no room to sit. The customers get to wear black monogrammed smocks and drink their fill of coffee, tea or ice water with a twist of lemon. They can order lunch from a menu while their bill is running up to $90 to $295 for less than an hour's work, typical of the high-end salons. The trend, Mr. Fekkai said, is \\"very simple short hair, the length between the neck and chin.\\" Ms. Iverson said: \\"It's not necessarily the best haircut in the world. You can pay $60 and get the same thing, but it's the luxe element of going to these salons. People can say they got their hair cut next to Sigourney Weaver.\\"   MONIQUE P.

This may seem questionable to some in her latest work, ''Dances of the Golden Hall.'' It looks ornate, it glitters with the gold of Halston's tiaras and tigerskin half-robes, it specifically recalls India's temple sculpture rather than an abstraction of that imagery. It even sports a symmetry, possibly the biggest shock to those who see Martha Graham as the bearer of the 20th-century modernist principle in dance, the upholder of the jagged line and, in fact, of asymmetry.    For all its pageantry and apparent departure from the tough Graham norm, ''Dances of the Golden Hall'' falls completely into the Graham canon.   The Martha Graham Dance Company's current season at the City Center, which ends next Sunday, has also included three great revivals from the 1930's and 1940's -''Primitive Mysteries,'' ''Herodiade'' and ''Dark Meadow.'' The 1981 ''Acts of Light'' has been reordered in sequence and slightly revised, with some new costumes. The recent works and other dances of the 1940's and 1950's are also represented. Only the 1960's are missing. In many ways, the new pieces are closer to the nondramatic works of the 1930's and to those of the late 1940's, a time when Miss Graham became interested in Eastern religions and the writings of the art scholar and author of ''The Dance of Shiva,'' Ananda K.

''It's a sign of a tremendously strong U.S. economy,'' said Allen Sinai, president of Primark Decision Economics of Boston. The rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point, to 4.7 percent, the lowest since 4.6 percent in October 1973. Most other data also pointed to a robust economy. Retailers reported unexpectedly strong October sales, underscoring the importance of Halloween goods","excerpt":"the Goldman Sachs retail composite index climbed 4.5 percent. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that manufacturing unexpectedly strengthened in October, and the Conference Board said its index of leading indicators rose two-tenths of a percent in September. Also, personal incomes rose four-tenths of a percent in September, while factory orders rose for the fourth consecutive month. Demand for metals and high technology paced the gain of four-tenths of a percent. Construction spending fell unexpectedly in September, however, posting its biggest drop in almost a year, 1.1 percent.    MARKETS  A Rocky Recovery  Like many convalescents, the stock market had some good days and some bad ones. After being battered the previous week, the Dow Jones industrial average soared 232 points on Monday. By Friday, investors were selling -- reacting, again, to the uncertainties in Southeast Asia, as well as to the specter of inflation raised by the strong jobs data. The blue-chip average ended the week at 7,581.32, up 139.24 for the week. The Nasdaq composite index was up 8.79 at 1,602.40. . . . The New York Stock Exchange plans to drop its controversial rule No. 500, which makes it nearly impossible for a listed company to move to another market voluntarily. Nasdaq officials have long cited it, warning potential defectors that if they went to the Big Board, there would be no turning back.    TAXES  Vox Populi Is Heard  Were L. L. Bean's flannel shirts about to join the tea in Boston Harbor? Their phone lines jammed by angry consumers, mail order companies backed away from an agreement that the Direct Marketing Association had reached with state tax authorities to collect sales taxes. . . . Nor are Federal taxes any more welcome. The House voted by an overwhelming 426 to 4 to rein in the Internal Revenue Service, giving taxpayers new rights and authorizing the creation of a new board made up largely of private citizens to oversee the tax collectors. ''The I.R.S. is too big and too mean,'' said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader. The agency is also getting a new boss, who has promised to tame it, as well as to rejuvenate its arthritic computers. The Senate confirmed Charles O. Rossotti, co-founder of American Management Systems, a computer systems and consulting company, as commissioner.    COMPANIES  Levi's Cutoffs  It's not that people finally have enough jeans. It's a matter of competing while paying American workers. Levi Strauss said it would cut a third of its American manufacturing jobs, affecting 6,395 workers and closing 11 factories in four states. But it promised a generous severance package. . . . City officials halted work on Donald J. Trump's $3 billion Riverside South project in Manhattan, below, because of defective concrete. Mr. Trump said the subcontractor that poured it, Laquila/Pinnacle, would have to bear the resultant costs. . . . AT&T is cutting to 3 from 33 the number of long-distance rates paid by residential customers who do not subscribe to a special calling plan. . . . General Electric is cashing in its 13 percent stake in Lockheed Martin for $2.8 billion. . . . Boeing plans to phase out the MD-80 and the MD-90, civilian jets that compete with its 737. Boeing inherited the planes when it acquired McDonnell Douglas.    DEALS  Gambling on ITT  Hilton Hotels raised its hostile bid for control of ITT, only to be countered on Friday with a sweetened offer from Starwood Lodging Trust. Shareholders are to meet on Wednesday. . . . The Justice Department recommended that BellSouth not be allowed to offer long-distance service in South Carolina. . . . Microsoft is close to an agreement to invest up to $1 billion in the cable television operations of U S West, according to several people involved in the negotiations.     PRICES  Ceilings Are Legal  Consumers can shop for that hot new car with less fear of having to pay a premium. The Supreme Court, in one of its most important antitrust decisions in years, ruled unanimously that a manufacturer or supplier does not necessarily violate Federal antitrust law by placing a ceiling on the retail price a dealer can charge for its products. The decision was widely welcomed by manufacturers, notably those in the auto and computer industries, who said it could lead to lower consumer prices. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted that it remained illegal for manufacturers to impose minimum prices on dealers.

The series ran from 1964 to 1972 and has won new fans through its current broadcasts on Nick at Night. Like \\"I Dream of Jeannie,\\" which premiered a year later, \\"Bewitched\\" shows women as uncanny superior beings who renounce their magic powers to fit into their narrow domestic role in postwar America. Barbara  Eden's Jeannie is far more overtly sexual than Montgomery's Samantha, who has the breezy, androgynous nickname Sam. But even Jeannie ends up cozy and cuddly,  unlike Kim Novak's eerie witch in the 1958 film \\"Bell, Book and Candle.\\"         In \\"Bewitched,\\" Samantha struggles to be merely human, defending her bland domestic zone against a meddlesome clan of witches and wizards. Her battle-ax mother, Endora, ruthlessly heaps primeval scorn on Samantha's hopelessly square  mate. On the show, men are oafish but endearing and must be manipulated for their own good.

We thought the Russians had dealt amply with his boyhood in \\"Childhood of Maxim Gorky\\" last September, but apparently they felt they had only scratched the surface of his life in old Nizhni Novgorod. In \\"On His Own,\\" offered at the Cameo yesterday, young Maxim still is being kicked and cuffed by his elders, is looking wide-eyed at the world's misery and seeking stubbornly for some clue to the meaning and dignity of life.We won't say that it is a dull film, for Director Mark Donskoi again has conjured up so vivid a picture of Russia in the last century and has presented it so naturally that one has no thought of studio or actors, but accepts it as the work of some marvelous time and space machine. No film with its realistic quality of scene and performance can ever be completely dull. But it does drag through lack of dramatic and narrative continuity. It makes the same points over and over, merely changing the locale or the occasion. It lingers, with an amateur photographer's passion, over meaningless shots of sunsets on the river, trees swaying in the breeze, harbor views and moonlight.Leisurely treatment of a character, taking time to explain his spiritual and mental development and clarify the forces that were working in his molding, is part of every biographer's task. But wise selection of telling incidents must be part of it, too, and an important part even when the biography is to be permitted to stretch into a trilogy. Unless the Russian biographers practice a little Stakhanoffism on Gorky, he still will be in short pants when the next volume ends and will have earned the doubtful distinction of having the longest childhood in history.

But in the West, Ukraine is seen as unpredictable and unreasonable, particularly in its dealings with Russia.   We are often charged with reckless nationalism but the claim is seldom examined. Ukraine has been losing the propaganda war, creating unwanted and unnecessary dangers for everyone.   A principal explanation for the misperception is that news accounts and expert opinion in the West have a pro-Russian bias. For example, the $24 billion Western program of assistance announced last week was reported as aid to Russia, with little attention to Ukraine's share in it.   The explanation for this tilt is that the West has long had strong contacts with Moscow and poor contacts with Kiev. The former Soviet Government and Communist Party funneled everything through Moscow","excerpt":"the Government and party are gone, but the funnel remains.   The U.S. Government's presence in Russia is substantial, but not in Ukraine, which is the size of France. Hundreds of members of the international press corps are permanently stationed in Moscow, but only a handful are found in Kiev. Western business and academic ties have been almost exclusively with Russia.   There is alarm in the West when Ukraine questions the fate of tactical nuclear weapons that are being removed to Russia. But Western accounts never ask if Ukraine's questions have merit. What is happening to the weapons? Are they being destroyed, as agreed, or simply being relocated in Russia?   It surprises Ukrainians that the West, with its history of demands for verification in arms control, finds such concerns surprising. Western representatives talk only with officials in Moscow about removal of the weapons. If the West does not talk with officials in Ukraine, aren't Ukrainians right to raise their own alarms?   The West parrots the charge that Ukraine wants to create an army of 400,000 troops. It would be easy to talk with Ukrainians and find out that this would mean a more than two-thirds reduction in troops now in Ukraine. Such a rapid reduction will create enormous problems. The difficulty of finding work and housing for the former soldiers is the principal reason that the immediate reduction cannot be greater. The long-term plan is to have an even smaller army.    Western press reports have repeated the propaganda that Ukraine was unwilling to carry its share of the debt of the former Soviet Union. Anyone who has visited Kiev knows that Ukraine has always agreed to pay its share of the debts. But Ukraine also demands its share of the assets.    Nonetheless, the West cooperates when Russia takes all the assets. The Soviet seat on the U.N. Security Council is now the Russian seat. Possibly the seat could not be divided. But is this true for Soviet embassies that are now Russian embassies, for Soviet hard-currency earnings that are now Russian, for Soviet gold -- and for the Black Sea fleet, over which Boris Yeltsin reasserted control yesterday.   Perhaps the most revealing complaint associated with the Western misunderstanding of Ukraine involves its plan to replace the ruble with the hryvna, the new Ukrainian currency.   Those few Western experts who have been to Kiev and have listened are convinced that everyone, including Russia, will be better served if Ukraine moves quickly to a new currency that can support its economic reforms. Introducing a new currency is not reckless nationalism; it is responsible and necessary in order to preserve trade and develop economic relations with other countries, including Russia.   Russia must understand that it has truly independent countries on its borders. The challenge Ukraine faces is to act as responsibly as possible and to strengthen contacts with everyone, including Russia and the West, while it transforms its economy, politics and society.   The challenge for the West is to work at strengthening ties with new countries like Ukraine. Just four months ago, Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for independence. Ukraine won't go back. Neither can the West. Throw off old habits, come to Kiev and talk with Ukrainians about Ukraine. Come to Kiev. Listen to Ukraine."},{"year":"1942","title":"AT long last -- after four months of stalling, each waiting for the other to move -- the government's film coordinator and the motion-picture industry have gotten together on a program of \\"who shorts\\" to be made in Hollywood.

TOP STORIES    IZVESTIA    BRITISH POLICE IN MOSCOW: British investigators from the antiterrorist unit, SO15, arrived in Moscow on Monday to question three Russian businessmen who met with Alexander V. Litvinenko, the former Russian intelligence officer, the day he was stricken with radiation poisoning. One of the three, Andrei Lugovoi, will face the most intense questioning, the newspaper said.Mr. Lugovoi headed security for the ORT television channel, which was owned by Boris Berezovsky in the 1990's, before he fled Russia for asylum in Britain. Mr. Lugovoi, according to investigators, met with Mr. Litvinenko 4 times from mid-October to Nov. 1 and may also have met with Mr. Berezovsky.    KOMMERSANT    SUSPECTED SPY ACKNOWLEDGES RUSSIAN CITIZENSHIP: Paul William Hampel, arrested by Canadian authorities on Nov. 14 for espionage, has admitted to being a Russian citizen and has agreed to a swift deportation, his lawyer said on Monday. Last week, a member of the Canadian counterintelligence service testified that Mr. Hampel's actions were typical of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service or SVR. Since his arrest, the SVR has denied any connection with Mr. Hampel.    RUSSIA BANS RICE IMPORTS: Russia's agricultural oversight agency on Monday instituted a full ban on rice imports into the country. According to the announcement, in 2006 the agency identified about 2,000 tons of rice unfit for human consumption from Pakistan, India, Thailand, Egypt, China, Spain and others. Russia imports about 50 percent of its rice supply, leading some experts to anticipate a 100 percent rise in prices in the near future. Importers blamed lobbying groups for the ban, but also said it could be connected to fears about Russia's potential accession to the World Trade Organization.    GAZETA    NO IMMIGRANT AMNESTY: There will be no amnesty for illegal immigrants in Russia, the head of the Federal Migration Service said today following a roundtable on the subject in the State Duma. Since most immigrants come to Russia seeking work rather than permanent residence, he said an amnesty declaration would ''make no sense.'' Instead of amnesty, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, leader of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, suggested jailing illegal immigrants, closing railroad links with immigrants' home countries and increasing antiimmigrant propaganda in Russia.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA    GEORGIAN DIES IN DETENTION: A Georgian citizen held in a predeportation detention center in Moscow since Oct. 5, died on Dec. 2 of heart failure, two days after a Moscow court ruled that she was a legal Russian resident. When questioned by the newspaper, neither the Ministry of Interior nor the Federal Migration Service could say why the woman was held after Nov. 30, when she should have been released. A spokesperson for the Georgian Embassy in Moscow said that the Consul General had already begun an investigation.    GAIDAR'S ILLNESS STILL A MYSTERY: Doctors are still uncertain what caused Yegor T. Gaidar, a former Russian prime minister, to become ill and lose consciousness at a conference in Dublin on Nov. 24. According to Mr. Gaidar's spokesman, doctors are now sure that he was not poisoned with the radioactive substance that killed Mr. Litvinenko, but they have not ruled out poisoning all together. The spokesman also refuted claims by French media that Mr. Gaidar had met with Mr. Litvinenko on Nov. 1.    NOVYE IZVESTIA    GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS NATIONALIST HATRED, REPORT SAYS: According to a report to be released today by the Moscow Bureau for Human Rights, the hatred of ''others'' espoused by Russian nationalists has become manifest in the policies of the Russian government.

In Moscow, there is little if any material benefit to show for a half decade of structural change, and the absence is testing the people's confidence in their leadership. In the nations newly free from the Soviet orbit, the euphoria has ended as people and their governments grapple with the difficulties of building a future for themselves. It is a winter of uncomfortable, sometimes traumatic, transition, as New York Times correspondents in the region report in the following survey.  POLAND  Joblessness and Soaring Prices     As the first year of Poland's economic reform program nears its conclusion, the stores remain full of food and other goods, but the prices are beyond the reach of many working-class Poles. Unemployment has risen to 5.5 percent, or one million workers, and many others fear they are about to lose their jobs. Whoever wins the Dec. 9 presidential election will confront a divided Parliament that itself will face re-election in the spring. Meanwhile, officials are increasingly worried about the prospect that Soviet refugees could swarm across the border in search of food.    Poland's ambitious program to speed the transition to capitalism enjoyed widespread support of the public in its early phases, but the first round of presidential voting last week showed there is now substantial disquiet in the land. Stanislaw Tyminski, a political unknown, illustrated the depth of opposition among workers and younger voters when he came in second to Lech Walesa, the Solidarity chairman, in a showing that eliminated the Prime Minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, from the competition and prompted him to resign. Although Mr. Walesa failed to achieve a majority in the three-way race, he held a wide lead in the first public opinion poll taken after the election -- 58 percent to Mr. Tyminski's 30 percent. Still, many political observers wondered how any president could push ahead with plans to privatize industry, slash subsidies and close inefficient factories and mines. Mr. Walesa has endorsed the economic plan but has said he would change it in ways he has not spelled out. GERMANY  Promises and Impatience     In what used to be Communist East Germany, many people expected reunification to quickly bring them the bounty of a market economy, particularly after western German politicians promised a quick and painless transition. Now their patience is running out as problems mount. Last week, work stoppages crippled eastern Germany's rail system, and they may have been just a foretaste. While the supply of goods is ample, the level of personal debt among eastern Germans suddenly able to buy Western goods is climbing dangerously","excerpt":"the Government's plans to slash price supports on Jan. 1, a move expected to drive up the cost of nearly everything from rents to manufactured goods, generates the kind of fears that sparked the rail strike. Women, who joined the labor force in large numbers under the Communists and gained considerable economic independence, have been hit particularly hard; their jobs have been cut, and so have family care services that the Government used to pay for.   Despite the economic tensions, most Germans from the east continue to regard Chancellor Helmut Kohl as the sole guarantor of eventual prosperity -- one more reason that there appeared to be little doubt that he and his Christian Democrats would be re-elected in the all-German parliamentary elections today. In the weeks leading up to the voting, the Government tried to keep new pressures on the economy to a minimum -- giving in, for example, when workers at the big Trabant factory in Zwickau threatened to strike if the Government didn't provide the subsidies to maintain production of their funny little cars. Another troubling problem has been street violence among youths in the first weeks after unification. Much of the violence takes on neo-Nazi colorings, with screams of \\"Heil Hitler\\" and other Nazi slogans, but youth workers say much of the violence is less a coherent ideology than a cry for attention from a young generation that has lost its bearings in a society free of the strictures of Communist dictatorship. CZECHOSLOVAKIA  Still the Old Shoddiness    A year after Czechoslovakia's gentle revolution, its stores are still well stocked by Eastern European standards -- as they were even during the days of subservience to Moscow -- but the shoddiness of the goods displayed remains, along with the habits of poor service. The Government has announced a privatization plan that takes effect Jan. 1, and there is hope that this will break the bureaucracy's lockgrip on the economy. But it also arouses fears that rents will go up along with prices for nearly all consumer goods. Already, Government efforts to give the Czechoslovak crown, the unit of currency, partial convertibility have caused prices for some goods to rise drastically. The price of the Skoda Favorit, a popular, sturdy automobile, jumped in recent months to about 115,000 crowns, from 65,000, in a country where the average monthly wage hovers at about 3,500 crowns. The gulf crisis and sluggish Soviet oil deliveries have contributed to a doubling of gasoline prices.   For now, the friction between the country's 10 million Czechs and 5 million Slovaks appears to be subsiding. In last week's local elections, nationalist parties did remarkably poorly. Nevertheless, the economic burdens appear to be increasing a susceptibility to all kinds of conspiracy theories and quick solutions. Students who were prominent in the demonstrations that toppled the Communists last year have publicly complained about the slowness of change, while other leaders have complained about the apathy of most students. Scattered demonstrations have protested the lingering Communists in the bureaucracy, and voices call for President Vaclav Havel to get rid of the Prime Minister, Marian Calfa, a former Communist.  ROMANIA  Misery Prevails     Trying to inch its way out of a seemingly permanent state of crisis, the Romanian Government on Nov. 1 ushered in the winter season with the first jolt of economic reform. Prices on some goods jumped as much as 300 percent, but so far the changes have done little to alleviate the shortages that make life a misery for most Romanian consumers. In Bucharest, people still wait for hours in line to get meat, gasoline and other basics; water is periodically shut off, and now as an added insult, cigarettes are suddenly hard to find. Political discontent, which has been brewing all year, has taken on new life with the formation of a new opposition group, the Civic Alliance, and many expect it to crescendo around the turn of the year as the country marks the first anniversary of the overthrow of the Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. \\"The only solution, a second revolution,\\" was one chant at an anti-government demonstration on Nov. 21, an appeal expected to feed on the grim living conditions.   Hungary Full Shelves, Now   As winter sets in, Hungarians continue to enjoy a level of prosperity that their neighbors to the east can only dream of. The stores are full not only of Hungarian products, but also of Western goods, and outdoor stands still offer a colorful array of fresh fruits and vegetables that would trigger huge lines in Bucharest, Sofia or Moscow. But for all the outward abundance, Hungarians are also bracing for the shock of 1991. The double-barrel impact of higher oil prices and decreased tax revenues comes on top of an inflation rate that has reached 30 percent and is already forcing some painful choices, for people and their government. Even those who are doing well in Hungary's struggling private sector share the gloomy mood that permeates Budapest today, as their families begin to economize on meat, Sunday outings and purchases that had come to be accepted as part of the Hungarian way of life. Last month's three-day taxi strike, set off by a sudden rise in gasoline prices, made the Government realize the limits of the Hungarian public's patience, and the depths of its frustration with a dropping standard of living. BULGARIA  Signs of Distrust     The first victim of the winter's discontent in Bulgaria was the Government, which last week resigned after three days of strikes and a monthslong campaign by the opposition. The outgoing Prime Minister, Andrei Lukanov, a former Communist who like the rest of his party's leadership became a socialist before winning last June's elections, had tried to form a coalition government to bring the country out of a deepening economic crisis. But his efforts were rebuffed, a sign of the distrust that has produced a virtual paralysis in government and society. Given its historic bonds with the Soviet Union, Bulgaria is suffering the effects of its giant neighbor's decline most keenly. Higher oil prices and lost trade and revenues have pushed the economy to the brink: Bulgaria last spring stopped payment on its $10.5 billion debt. In Sofia, Western diplomats speak darkly of a winter where cutbacks in electricity, shortages of medicine and an inadequate diet could cost lives. YUGOSLAVIA  Seeking Survival     Nothing less than the survival of Yugoslavia itself is at stake this winter, as the federal Government struggles to come up with a formula that will hold together the country's bitterly divided national groups. Serbia, the largest of the six republics, will hold its first parliamentary elections this month, but an expected boycott by ethnic Albanians living in the troubled province of Kosovo will only highlight democracy's difficulties in this Balkan nation. Political uncertainties and ethnic hatreds have clouded attempts at economic reform, led by the federal Prime Minister, Ante Markovic. Even in Slovenia, the northernmost republic, which has historically been the most prosperous, production has dropped, the trade deficit is growing and local governments are running short of cash. SOVIET UNION  The Weariness of Waiting for Results     FOR the second consecutive year, the Soviet Union is entering winter in a mood of deep pessimism. Changes here started earlier than in Eastern Europe but are likely to take longer. With no experience of democracy, most Soviet citizens had unrealistic expectations and now are disproportionately disenchanted.   Last winter, a half-decade into perestroika, anxiety about the availability of food already bordered on panic; again this year food is the first preoccupation of the public. For the average citizen more time than ever goes into the hunt for affordable goods; meanwhile, politicians here and abroad are feeding the anxiety with talk of \\"famine.\\" The problem is distribution rather than production, and there is no evidence of impending starvation. But in the urban centers, where the disappearance of state-supplied foodstuffs is most dramatic, that is not much consolation.   The level of discontent has made it difficult to enact unpopular measures aimed at moving toward free markets, and outsiders sympathetic to the reform process have begun to worry that hard-liners could seize on the disaffection to destabilize the Government. That fear -- as much as humanitarian concern -- has motivated Germany, for example, to move to send food aid.   The breakdown in food distribution is also a symptom of a breakdown in political power. The union is disintegrating into republics, autonomous regions, provinces, insurgent city councils and even neighborhoods proclaiming sovereignty. President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev has power -- the military, K.G.B., the police -- without authority. His rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian republic, has authority -- the ability to direct popular behavior -- without a real grip on power. The political drama of the season is the effort to find some kind of a coalition that will unite power and authority, and stabilize the union. But at the moment the two men are in head-on competition.   Mr. Gorbachev's proposal for a new treaty defining the federal union seems to be a dead letter. Five or six republics have declared flatly that they will not sign it, and Russia will not go along unless it is assured real sovereignty, meaning the superiority of its laws over Soviet law -- something Mr. Gorbachev cannot accept. But Mr. Gorbachev is holding firm to his course, hoping the tide will shift as the public grows frustrated with the lingering political paralysis. Mr. Yeltsin, meanwhile, is trying with some success to set up a kind of Soviet commonwealth; bilateral treaties with other republics seem to hold more promise for the union than Mr. Gorbachev's proposals.    The public is basically furious at everyone. People have lost much of their faith in the ability of democratic politics to get them out of the mess, and a strong yearning for \\"decisive measures\\" -- although not, apparently, for dictatorship -- extends to economic as well as political measures.    Mr. Gorbachev is increasingly held personally culpable, and he seems incapable of winning back the public's trust. Mr. Yeltsin remains hugely popular, but lesser democrats are already beginning to lose their luster as the public tires of windy televised debates and sees nothing in the stores; Mr. Yeltsin, too, could face such a decline.

The delightful fun in this racy feature is due to the capable acting and the splendid cooperation between Sidney Franklin, the director, and Hans Kraely, the scenario writer who came to this country from Berlin with Ernst Lubitsch. The actual narrative was inspired by a Hungarian, play called \\"Sybil.\\"Miss Talmadge is singularly attractive and, therefore, between the mirth-provoking situations one is apt to reflect on her graceful gowns, on a captivating countenance wholly surrounded by costly furs and on her constantly busy eyes. As Marian Duncan, the American girl who finds her Ace of Hearts in Lieutenant Orloff, she has, in the course of her successive dilemmas, the full sympathy of those watching the screen. Through no fault of her own, she is toasted by the officers of the Czar's crack dragoons, as the Grand Duchess, just when the Grand Duke enters the banquet hall. He, never for a moment thinking that his wife is in the offing, lies like a gentleman, and leaves no doubt in the minds of the jubilant gathering regarding Marian's noble identity.It is somewhat trying, even for Marian Duncan, to have the Grand Duke report to her apartment just when she was having a few words with Lieutenant Orloff, who incidentally had been sentenced to remain in his quarters. Orloff has to make a speedy retreat to a closet, from which he can near the Duke's protestations of affection. But that is not all, for the Grand Duchess, having heard rumors regarding her fickle swain, also calls upon Marian, with the consequence that, as there is only one closet, the Grand Duke is forced to conceal himself in the same place with his disobedient Lieutenant. One word from the young officer and the Grand Duke would have had a most difficult time with his severe-looking consort.Another amusing episode happens when Marian expects Lieutenant Orloff, and has a table set for a nice tête-à-tête repast. In a spirit of mischief, when she hears footsteps, she goes behind a screen, from which she touches the Grand Duke's leg and later caresses his face, which action discloses to the girl's amazement that her hand has come into contact with an unfamiliar face.Herein one also perceives Chester Conklin as an excitable hotel manager, whose method of keeping the secret arrival of the Grand Duchess is to inform all his employes. It is he who presents a bouquet of flowers to Marian, believing her to be the Grand Duchess, and it is he who is shocked when he discovers afterward his outrageous mistake.Tullio Carminati, an Italian actor, is seen for the first time in this picture, in which he gives a capital performance. He is handsome and manly. The rôle of the susceptible Grand Duke falls to Edward Martindel, who lends the necessary dignity to the compromising situations in which the noble Russian finds himself. Rose Dione, as the Grand Duchess, adds to the amusement by the austerity of her expression.

The Argentine Government earlier had charged that Mr. Graiver was a financial adviser for the Montoneros, a leftist terrorist group, and they have suggested that Montonero money was used by Mr. Graiver to seek control of American Bank and Trust. Eight relatives and former employees of Mr. Graiver were sentenced to long jail terms in Argentina for allegedly helping the guerrillas. The Graivers are Jewish and their prosecution raised charges of anti&#8208;Semitism on the part of the ultraconservative Argentine military Government. Mr. Morgenthau said the aid of Interpol, the international police organization, would be invoked in the search for Mr. Graiver; meanwhile, the Manhattan grand jury that indicted him has been extended through 1979; it is expected to investigate the possibility of other crimes, on the theory that if Mr. Graiver is indeed still alive, the pilots who died in the plane crash have been murdered.

While the pennant races conclude and football begins its regular autumn season, hockey sneaks quietly in the back door this week, with players reporting to training camps to prepare for a regular season that starts in early October and is followed by a playoff tournament that ends in mid-June.

Some people need to make no effort at all to remember who has been laid to rest","excerpt":"the grave is fresh, and so is the grief. In some cemeteries, the graves of military veterans are tended by members of the American Legion or the Veterans of Foreign Wars. And in other cemeteries, of course, the graves get no tending at all and are already thick in grass by the end of May. The dead grow more distant, year by year. The living are so busy simply living.     But if this is a day devoted to remembering, it's also a day that has to acknowledge forgetting. The force of the season insists upon it. So does the logic of time, which is an ethical mystery all its own. It would be good to find the very old grave of a soldier from long ago -- not anonymous, but still unknown -- and pay it a visit. Pick up the litter, yes, but let the grass keep growing. Stand where someone from an old war is lying, a veteran of the Civil War perhaps. For a moment, you may wonder how that person died. But what you'll really find yourself wondering is how he lived and what he knew.

Don't forget a soupcon of saleability. Top it off with some sprinkles of originality (optional). Shake well and serve neat. That's the great American fashion cocktail for spring 1991.   Instead of assuming a cautious conservative stance -- which would have been dull but understandable considering the current bleak retail scene -- the majority of New York's designers, stylists and manufacturers have come up with surprisingly buoyant and high-spirited spring collections. At the American showings earlier this month, almost every designer stepped out with clothes that were perky and positive, even optimistically sunny. Skirts continued to be short. The dress returned with a vengeance. Pretty colors like hot pink predominated, though every designer showed something in white. Shine has become a major statement, with plastic or vinyl and splashes of sequins for day or night. But it was the ferocity of the 1960's revival that was most remarkable. Sleeveless cookie-cutter dresses, saucy A-line shapes, big heads of hair, batty eye makeup and accessories like little white gloves and small, structured handbags became commonplace.

At least this is so in a British picture called \\"The Wrecker,\\" wherein that veteran screen player, Carlyle Blackwell, officiates as an expert train wrecker, known as Ambrose Barney. The fact that thirty-five persons have lost their lives causes him to chuckle over his bacon and eggs. He has a motive for his dirty work. He is a railroad official, a fact that does not exactly help Scotland Yard in the search for the wrecker. He is also the guiding light of a motor-bus concern and the train disasters impel the British public to patronize the buses rather than risk their lives on the railway.\\"The Wrecker,\\" a childish melodrama, in its direction and acting, is based on the play of the same name by Arnold Ridley and Bernard Merivale. It came to the stage here last year. The play must have been better than its cinema offspring, for it ran for forty performances. The picture has been inoculated with sound effects and the inevitable theme song, which is titled, \\"Are You Really Mine?\\"Imagine the dramatic effect of this romantic warbling, when the express train, known throughout Britain as the \\"Shooting Star,\\" is thought to be plunging on its way to a collision with a fast freighter and aboard it are the hero and heroine and the woman who has squealed on Barney! Twelve minutes more, one is informed, and everybody will be crushed to death! Minutes pass and the stupid hero believes in risking lives rather than pull the emergency signal. But soon Barney is disarmed and the hero clambers over the tender and warns the locomotive driver. Comes then the theme song, just as the freight and passenger locomotives stop within a few feet of each other. One hears feminine voices floating from the screen:\\"Are you really mine?Is it really true?I belong to you—\\"The good-looking but unimaginative hero and the charming girl are then seen embracing each other.The registering of love, greed, annoyance, impatience and fury is done according to the old-fashioned school of acting. In fact the actions and the expressions of the players in \\"The Wrecker\\" are reminiscent of America's first film feature, \\"The Great Train Robbery.\\"Mr. Blackwell can blame it on the director. So can the other performers and the director can blame the results on his cast. Mr. Blackwell might, however, have avoided having his hair neatly combed a fraction of a second after it had been thoroughly roughed up by the feminine squealer. Roger Doyle, the handsome young fellow who gives up cricket to find the individual who is known as \\"The \\"Wrecker,\\" portrays irritation and impatience by tapping on the arm of a chair. His work in other respects is much given to stopping, looking, listening during moments that call for speed and action.On the same bill is a Christie-Paramount talking film comedy, called \\"Her Husband's Women.\\" It sounds very much as though the players were speaking through barrels of megaphones and sometimes the words might be a mixture of Greek and English for all the information they conveyed yesterday afternoon.

Two years later the story was translated to the movies. It had a great success on its own part, and its many imitations basked in reflected fame. Now comes the sequel to \\"What Price Glory?\\"—\\"The Cock Eyed World.\\"The further adventures of those two warriors. Quirt and Flagg, were set on paper by Messrs. Anderson and Stallings: their rôles are acted by Edmund Lowe and Victor McLaglen—who were in the movie version of \\"What Price Glory?\\" Charmaine, in the person of Dolores del Rio, has departed—or has been left in France—but in her place are a host of other more or less sophisticated charmers.That \\"What Price Glory?\\" was remembered, and its sequel looked for with enthusiasm, could be seen from the manner in which huge crowds stampeded Roxy's when the picture opened on Saturday. There were long lines on the street outside the theatre for most of the day","excerpt":"the greater number of them brought by the picture, but some, no doubt, by the chance of seeing Victor McLaglen, who is giving a small talk in conjunction with \\"The Cock Eyed World.\\" The crowds seemed to highly enjoy both the film and Mr. McLaglen.\\"The Cock Eyed World\\" differs from its predecessor mainly in feeling—the irony which formed the basic property of \\"What Price Glory?\\" Flagg and Quirt still insult each other, they still like the barroom atmosphere and Charmaine's sisters—but their raucousness is this time devised more at entertainment than at editorialization.The picture, being by temporal birth a member of the dialogrue-sound-music-dancing family, has talking sequences throughout. Conversation, of course, is effective. There are also many spots in its length where marines play mouth-organs, where they listen to stringed instruments and where they march to the sound of bands. Possibly there is a shade too much music.\\"The Cock Eyed World\\" starts in Russia on the day the order is received for the marines to return to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Then there are scenes aboard ship, others in Brooklyn, a Coney Island sequence. Not long after this the regiment is ordered South-presumably in pursuit of Sandino, although he is not mentioned.In the tropics Mariana (Lily Damita) puts in a far from chaste appearance and forms the most Southern argument for Flagg and Quirt. Then Flagg goes on a reconnoitering trip by airplane and Quirt gets a bad case of fever. The former, returning, goes to his enemy's bedside and there is conversation about \\"pals.\\"Not long after this not-too-touching scene Flagg leads his troops to glory in the only battle scenes (they are good ones) of the play, and Quirt calmly proceeds to pet well. Then, as in \\"What Price Glory?\\" there is an argument as to which is the father of Mariana's child. That straightened out, at the end of the story, the regiment—and Flagg and Quirt—prepare to return to the States.The chief assets of \\"The Cock Eyed World\\" are its boisterous comedy, its direction and the acting of Messrs. McLaglen and Lowe. Such are its properties that it likely will remain a tenant of the Roxy for a few weeks to come.The Roxy stage show for the week acts as a prelude to the picture. It is modernistic by manner, being a simultaneous projection of a news reel, an orchestra's playing, shootings, whistles, dancing and color of all kinds. It is effective.And Mr. McLaglen's speech—his personal appearances run only through today—is chiefly about how he likes his public and hopes that it he like his picture.

In mixed highway and city driving, the agency has found, a car that gets 30 miles to the gallon in winter in southern Texas might get 27 in Missouri and 24 in northern Minnesota. In summer, the same car might get 33 miles to the gallon in Texas, 31 or 32 in Missouri and 30 in Minnesota.

The film was adapted for the screen by Tim Blake Nelson from his play. In turning the play into a film, the fateful decision was made to pursue a grim, uncompromising realism that may be unprecedented for a nondocumentary film about the Holocaust.

It is a war that the 54-year-old former marine fears he will have to fight until he goes to his own grave.    Mr. Madison's son, Anthony, 27, was one of 13 Army reservists from this proud, hard-luck region of Western Pennsylvania who was killed in a Scud missile attack in Saudi Arabia in the final days of the war.   \\"My son's death has changed my whole life,\\" Mr. Madison said here the other day as he held his son's Purple Heart. \\"I'm altogether different than what I was. I don't know how to describe it.\\"    \\"Emptiness?\\" his wife, Darla, suggested.    \\"Yeah,\\" Mr. Madison agreed, \\"and I can't fill it up.\\"   Twenty-eight reservists were killed that night in the desert but no other patch of America had to bury so many of its sons and daughters, so many of its dreams of grandchildren and fishing trips.   And nowhere else in America were so many broken hearts left behind, scattered across the hilly countryside of small cities and towns like the leafless trees that now sway in the winter wind.   For much of the last year, Diane Radocaj has tried to help ease the suffering as head of a family support group in Greensburg, where the reservists were based.    \\"From what I've seen there is a variety of emotions,\\" she said. \\"Some are bitter and they always will be. Others have accepted it. But the emotion that dominates is just a sense of loss.\\"    In Rochester Mills, a town with one street, where Specialist Christine L. Mayes grew up and was buried at age 22, her father said he and his family were \\"getting as close to normal as you can get.\\"    \\"I could be bitter and cynical but I'm not,\\" Franklin Mayes said. \\"You can dwell on this until it drives you crazy. You have to let it go. Enough is enough.\\" Mr. Mayes's daughter was one of two women from the reserve unit, the 14th Quartermaster Detachment, to be killed in the attack. On the anniversary, Feb. 25, a stone monument will be dedicated to the reservists, both living and dead. Fund for Children of Dead    The $250,000 monument will sit near the entrance of the reserve center in Greensburg and will be surrounded by 13 newly planted trees. Most of the construction, labor and material have been donated. A $20,000 scholarship fund has been established for the 10 children of the dead.   But most people here have closed the door on the war, said the Roman Catholic Bishop of Greensburg, the Rev. Anthony Bosco.    \\"People are back to their own problems,\\" he said. \\"The people who have the empty chair at the dinner table are the ones who feel it. That's not cruel. That's life.\\"   Bishop Bosco said the recession had hit the area hard. Tomorrow, he said, is what most people here now worry about.   \\"I think the proof that Desert Storm is history is in George Bush's popularity polls,\\" the Bishop said. \\"His popularity here is not good because of the economy.\\" 'My Boy Died for Oil'    In Mr. Madison's hilltop home, President Bush is an especially bitter subject.    \\"What really burns me up is that nothing has changed over there,\\" Mr. Madison said. \\"Hussein is still in control. Our President sits around waving his flag like he did something. He didn't do anything. Nothing. My son is dead. What did he die for?\\"    Last February as he waited for his son's body, Mr. Madison said he believed the war was necessary. But today, after months of grief and reflection, he said he no longer had faith in the Government.   \\"They lie and lie and lie and it never ends,\\" Mr. Madison said. \\"The war was about oil. My boy died for oil.\\"   As he talked, tears welling in his eyes, his wife, who was Anthony Madison's stepmother, touched his shoulder and said, \\"It'll be a year ago next month that Tony died, but it seems like yesterday.\\" Faded Glory: Looking Back at the Gulf War -- A Special Report Year After Gulf War, Joy Is a Ghost","excerpt":"The Grief: Broken Hearts Left Behind"},{"year":"2001","title":"DRATT-Rose.

New Jersey Local Names, a directory published by the State Department of Transportation, lists more than 3,000 ''locales, areas and municipalities,'' most of them unincorporated hamlets, neighborhoods, communities, nooks or crannies that someone, at some time, decided to call by a name. Here are three.    COPPER HILL    Raritan Township, Hunterdon County    In the mid-1830's, prospectors began searching here for copper. They found traces in the soil and deep within the hill, but in small quantities and of low quality. Unable to compete with the greater reserves and more profitable operations out west, the mine at Copper Hill was shut down. Today the hill is home to a school, a golf course and a country club.    PENNY POT    Folsom, Atlantic County    In 1762, a tavern and inn was built to accommodate travelers and shelter their horses on the old stage route from Camden to Absecon. The tavern became known as the Smashed Hat Tavern, for, instead of replacing broken window planes, the innkeeper stuffed hats in the windows to keep the cold out.    Legend has it that a traveler from Cape May stopped for the night. When he settled his account, the innkeeper needed change and called to his wife to bring it to him. She called back and said there was ''not a penny in the pot.''    BRASS CASTLE    Washington Township, Warren County    Brass Castle was neither a castle nor made of brass.    Jacob Brass, a local businessman, settled here in the mid-19th century and built an immense log house. According to Snell's History of Sussex and Warren Counties (1881), residents were so impressed by its size that it became known as Brass Castle.

But the incumbent Republican, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who has taken to claiming that he is the true heir to Gov. Bill Clinton's coattails, was also endorsed by some Democrats.   Dominick Fusco, chairman of the Committee of 100 Democrats, a Bronx Democratic organization, said his group had decided to endorse Mr. D'Amato because of Mr. Abrams's \\"ethnic slurs\\" against Mr. D'Amato.    Mr. Abrams called Mr. D'Amato a \\"fascist\\" at a campaign stop in Binghamton, N.Y., the weekend before last. Mr. Fusco, who spoke at Mr. D'Amato's Manhattan campaign headquarters yesterday, said that as an Italian-American who lived during the World War II era, \\"fascist is a bigger insult than any other insult.\\"   Mr. Fusco called it \\"rare\\" for his group to endorse a Republican. But the move was not entirely unexpected","excerpt":"the group endorsed Rudolph W. Giuliani in the 1989 mayoral race. Brother Clinton    Mr. D'Amato, who has called Mr. Abrams far more liberal than Mr. Clinton, says that on issues like the death penalty and welfare reform, he has more in common with the Democratic Presidential nominee than Mr. Abrams.   Mr. D'Amato said his fortunes were not necessarily tied to Mr. Bush's. \\"There is some limited impact,\\" he said, referring to Mr. Clinton's lead in the polls at the top of the Democratic ticket. \\"But ours is a strongly contested race. We're both names, we're both well-known.\\"    Mr. D'Amato has kept his distance from George Bush, but he could not avoid his Vice President. Dan Quayle was the the featured guest at the Conservative Party dinner last night, which Mr. D'Amato was scheduled to attend. Even before the dinner, Mr. Abrams said that merely by attending, Mr. D'Amato was \\"showing his true colors as a loyal servant of Bush-Quayle.\\"   Last night, Mr. D'Amato greeted the Vice President cordially as Mr. Quayle came to the dais, and the Vice President praised the Senator as a \\"fighter\\" who had won his support when they were colleagues in the Senate. But afterward, Mr. D'Amato did not seem especially eager to talk about the Vice President, who had preached fire and brimstone against Mr. Clinton at the dinner. Asked if Mr. Quayle's message had been good for his Senate campaign, Mr. D'Amato referred instead to his own speech, in which he had criticized Mr. Abrams.   Mr. Moynihan, the senior Senator from New York, predicted a Democratic \\"blowout\\" in New York. He repeatedly clapped the Attorney General on the back and said Mr. Abrams would be an important part of a new Democratic dominance of Washington politics and promised \\"100 days like we haven't seen since 1933.\\"  Remembering the 1970's    Both campaigns made use of giant props yesterday. Mr. Abrams spoke against the backdrop of a large sign painted to look like a check for $117 billion and signed \\"jobless New Yorkers.\\" It was a reference to Mr. Abrams's claim that New York has lost $117 billion in Federal money since Mr. D'Amato took office.   Mr. D'Amato, who began his morning at the Long Island Rail Road station in Mineola, denounced his opponent while standing next to a giant billboard on the train station wall.  Above Mr. Abrams's name was text from an interview with The Bronx Press Review, a weekly newspaper, that read: \\"I am here today to oppose a New York State law or any other form of subsidy for the L.I.R.R.\\" Beneath it, the campaign added its own message. \\"Now, he wants to be your Senator.\\" An aide to Mr. D'Amato said the poster would be displayed on billboards throughout the L.I.R.R. system.   Mr. Abrams's statement was made in 1970, when he was the Bronx Borough President. Mr. D'Amato said that the 22-year-old remark was still relevant.   Timothy Gilles, a spokesman for Mr. Abrams, called the poster an \\"outrageous mischaracterization,\\" and said Mr. Abrams had opposed any further subsidies for the L.I.R.R. until the city's subways received their fair share of financial aid.

Nancy Druckman, the director of Sotheby's folk-art department, said this week that the red, white and blue images reflect the optimism felt after the Civil War for a strong Union. She said the quilt was completed in 1867, a date embroidered on a square showing a black man, wearing a straw hat and striped coat, leading a goat-drawn cart labeled \\"Ice Cream Done.\\"   \\"This is one of the most remarkable quilts I've handled in my 20-year tenure here,\\" Mrs. Druckman said. \\"It's most unusual to see a number of black and white people represented on a 19th-century quilt. It was made in New York State, where many people had supported the abolitionist movement. To me it represents the first blush of hopefulness after the Civil War.\\"   Mrs. Druckman said the unidentified seller, an elderly widower, told her that it had been handed down in his wife's family in New York. Each of the 42 squares is appliqued and embroidered with a different image of people, flowers, animals or birds banded in red. On one, a black man speaks to a white man on horseback and his words, \\"Master I am free,\\" are embroidered between them.   The house estimates the quilt will bring $50,000 to $80,000.   At the same session, Sotheby's will auction 26 weather vanes from a collection of about 70 acquired over 20 years by David L. Davies, a San Francisco graphics designer and real-estate investor. The rest are to be offered in Americana sales in January and next October. Mr. Davies decided this summer to send his weather vanes to Sotheby's after he sold his carriage house in New Jersey, where they were housed. \\"He had tapered off collecting weather vanes in recent years,\\" Mrs. Druckman said. Sotheby's estimates that the collection will bring $700,000 to $1 million","excerpt":"the group to be auctioned tomorrow is estimated to sell for $110,000 to $150,000.    Weather vanes of vehicles, a special interest of Mr. Davies, include a rare mid-19th-century copper vane of a fire-hose reeler, which is estimated to sell for $20,000 to $25,000, and a copper fire engine from the late 19th century made by Harris & Company of Boston, at $25,000 to $35,000. Others depicting horses, cars, a bicycle, a biplane and a hook and ladder are estimated to bring $5,000 or less each.  Important Pedigrees    Several impressive German silver vessels to be auctioned in a sale at 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. on Wednesday at Christie's in New York were bought in the 1930's and 40's by Siegfried Kramarsky, a German-born banker, philanthropist and art collector who died in 1961. Mr. Kramarsky also owned van Gogh's \\"Portrait of Dr. Gachet,\\" which brought $82.5 million at Christie's in New York last year in a sale to a Japanese industrialist.    \\"These are marvelous things with important pedigrees that are fresh to the market,\\" said Christopher Hartop, who heads Christie's silver department. For example, he said, Mr. Kramarsky paid $160 for a gilded silver squirrel perched on a tree, an item made in Nuremberg, Germany, about 1600 and bought at a 1947 New York auction of silver originally owned by J. Pierpont Morgan. Christie's estimates the squirrel will bring $40,000 to $60,000.   A silver-gilt cup in the form of a leather-covered shoe, a vessel made for the shoemaker's guild about 1580 in Nuremberg, was bought by Mr. Kramarsky for $650 at a 1949 sale in New York of the collection of Joseph Brummer, an art dealer. Christie's estimates the shoe will sell for $40,000 to $60,000. Another Kramarsky object from Nuremberg combines gilded silver and a nautilus shell to make a covered cup on a stand with finials of a snarling winged dragon and Neptune. Christie's presale estimate for this richly embellished object from about 1630 is $50,000 to $80,000.  A Bankrupt Toy Store    Christie's in New York announced this week that it would auction on Dec. 16 the period toys from the Manhattan branch of Mint and Boxed. The three-story toy shop was opened a year ago by Jeffrey S. Levitt, a British collector turned dealer. The store, on Madison Avenue at 84th Street, closed in May when Mint and Boxed filed for bankruptcy. The 550 toys are to be auctioned without starting prices in a sale that Christie's estimates will total more than $1.5 million.   The contents of Mr. Levitt's store in Edgware, Middlesex, near London, are to be auctioned on Jan. 16 by Sotheby's in London in a sale of 500 toys that it estimates will total $850,000. The store went into receivership this year.                    . . .         SOTHEBY'S, York Avenue at 72d Street, Manhattan,(212) 606-7245.

Since his discovery by Wynton Marsalis in 1987, Mr. Hargrove, above, has ranked among his generation's leading proponents of hard bop, with fruitful detours into symphonic strings, Cuban groove and neo-soul. He caused a minor stir in 2003 with the RH Factor, an electric project trafficking in soul, gospel and R & B, along with a sprinkling of organic hip-hop","excerpt":"the group's debut, ''Hard Groove'' (Verve), featured guest turns by the singers D'Angelo and Erykah Badu and the rappers Q-Tip and Common.

If it all suggests a double life, that's not far off the mark: Mr. Hargrove's forthcoming album, ''Reflections and Distractions,'' will feature one disc of hard bop and another of RH Factor groove. (The album is scheduled for release in late-February on Verve.)

Where from? Japan, of all places, and from the devastating hand of that great director, Akira Kurosawa. Here is one import—for suspense fans and students of moviecraft—that simply must be seen.Using, of all things, Ed McBain's strictly American novel, \\"King's Ransom,\\" as a source, Mr. Kurosawa and two co-scenarists have transferred the kidnaping yarn from Manhattan to Yokohama, using a fine cast headed by the famous Toshiro Mifune.The result is a sizzling, artistic crackerjack and a model of its genre, pegged on a harassed man's moral decision, laced with firm characterizations and tingling detail and finally attaining an incredibly colorful crescendo of microscopic police sleuthing. Crime, believe us, doesn't pay in Yokohama—not in the end.From the very fade-in, when Mr. Mifune, as a prosperous business executive, tangles with his stockholders in his suburban home, the quiet wizardry of the director is apparent in the chessboard groupings framed by the superb photography of Choichi Nakai and Takao Saito.The stage is set here, literally and leisurely, for a menacing telephone call and a crucial decision. Shall the bristly, self-made hero use his fortune to subjugate his hostile partners or to ransom his chauffeur's son, mistakenly kidnaped for his own? Mr. Kurosawa takes his time in these opening scenes, in the precise confinement of a two-room setting, with Mr. Mifune attended by his anxious wife Kyoko Kagawa","excerpt":"the groveling chauffeur, Yutaka Sada, and two extremely alert detectives, Tatsuy Nakadai and Kenjiro Ishiyama.About here, some viewers may wonder if the gifted director has blandly glued the whole film indoors. Not on your life.The action with the two detectives suddenly fans out across the bustling metropolis. The chase is on and the dazzling scenes that follow, with the entire police force scientifically sifting skimpy evidence, make masterful use of pure movie technique.Mr. Kurosawa's galvanic use of a train for the ransom-tossing, for instance, makes the one in \\"The Lady Vanishes\\" seem like the Toonerville Trolley. Bit by bit, in such things as a crackling newspaper, the stillness of a coastal villa, a small boy's drawing and a brilliantly spangled kaleidoscope of Yokohama's lower depths, Mr. Kurosawa has composed a remarkable movie mosaic, both spine-tingling and compassionate.As the suave chief inspector, Mr. Nakadai almost steals the show. Almost. It belongs, of course, to the man who made it. Anyway—since we can't say it in Japanese—bravo!

CD-ROM Review","excerpt":"The Hardware Choices: On PC's, CD's Can Be a Pain"},{"year":"1991","title":"THE GULF between the theory of using computers in schools and the reality is wide and deep. It's a rare educator who does not believe that computers have a place in the classroom, but just how the computer is to be integrated is still subject to intense debate. Even basic issues, like whether the system should be based in classrooms or in a separate laboratory, or whether or not it should be tied into a schoolwide network, engender argument.    What follows are considerations to keep in mind once the decision is made to computerize, whether it be a single classroom or an entire school system.   GOALS: Having a clear, well-thought-out plan detailing -- in writing -- the goals of the proposed computer system is a critical and often-overlooked first step. The document should include a statement of the school's basic education philosophy, what is expected of the computer system and how it is to be integrated into the current functions of the school.   CONSULTATIONS: Get input from teachers, administrators, parents and students. Each constituency has a different agenda for a computer system and these need to be reconciled. Students should be included in the process, because they often have the best grasp of what computers can do for them.   HIRE A CONSULTANT: If the school district doesn't have qualified hardware and software specialists, then hiring a consultant can be a wise investment. While software and hardware vendors offer deep discounts to educational institutions, a moderate-sized computer system can still cost several hundred thousand dollars. A good consultant can help a school save money, cut weeks off equipment installation and avoid many other pitfalls.    The problem is finding a good consultant. There are no licensing requirements to being a computer consultant, so check references carefully. See what arrangements, if any, the consultant has with hardware and software vendors. While it is best to deal with an independent consultant, there are some very good ones who have ties to vendors. Such vendors are usually intimate with their company's operation and procedures and can often cut bureaucratic corners.    SOFTWARE: The key to any computer system is the software. First find the software you want","excerpt":"the hardware decision will follow naturally.    There are hundreds of software vendors with thousands of programs on the market. Finding the right ones is tricky. Using the goals document can be an effective filter, helping to narrow your selection of vendors. Arrange with the vendor to have your staff and students -- using your criteria -- evaluate possible software purchases.   HARDWARE: The software needed to accomplish the school's education goals will dictate the type or brand of computer equipment needed. This decision is made even easier if computers have not previously been used in the school system. Unfortunately, few school systems today are completely devoid of computers, even if the models are antiques, like Commodore PET's and Atari 800's.    There are three main computer vendors in today's education market -- Apple, I.B.M. and Tandy. All offer one-stop shopping for hardware and software solutions.    Apple and Tandy have been in the market for years and there are plenty of schools using their older systems -- Apple II's and Tandy TRS80's -- to prove it. While Apple and Tandy still offer technical support and products for such older installations, it's the new-generation hardware that they're selling: Macintosh systems, in Apple's case, while Tandy is touting its 1000 series I.B.M.-compatibles.    TRAINING: \\"User friendly\\" is a nice concept, but nothing replaces proper training for making computers alluring to those who will use them. When planning your system, include an adequate budget for initial and ongoing training. This is an area often neglected. It is also the one that becomes a budget-buster, since school administrators seldom consider how expensive training can be if conducted after the fact.    STAFFING: Conventional wisdom has it that computers eliminate jobs. In large computer installations, however, they create several new ones. Systems administrator, system support and system maintenance are just a few positions needed to keep computers functioning properly.     HIDDEN COSTS: Ven dors are very good about giving hard numbers on the cost of their systems and software. But only school administrators can calculate the hidden costs -- the purchases and changes that must be made to accommodate a new computer system. Such costs must be included in the school budget.     Will a school building, for example, need new lighting or an upgraded electrical system? Must a regular classroom be transformed into a computer lab? There may be other one-time costs, like new furniture, printer stands, surge protectors, computer covers and extra cabling.    What might appear to be a minor expense can mushroom if school administrators are not alerted ahead of time. For example, floppy disks are not very expensive, but if a school decides to supply each student with a disk to store work, then several thousand disks will be needed, at a cost of several thousand dollars. And that does not include the price of replacing full or lost disks. Add to the price tag the cost of paper, printer ribbons and disk storage boxes, and suddenly the blush is off the school's computer bargain.   MAINTENANCE: Modern computer equipment is rugged and reliable, but it is not problem-free. A school can get a maintenance contract or hire an in-house maintenance staff. There is no clear-cut answer as to which method is preferable. Administrators must decide how much disruption their computer system can stand, and for how long, to determine which is more effective. Preventive maintenance is best.   UPGRADES: Computer technology does not stand still. More powerful computers are designed and software constantly evolves. With these new developments come upgrades. A school's budget should reflect a schedule of such upgrades. Before committing yourself examine the hardware or software carefully to determine whether the upgrade would provide an important new function or function only as a nice decoration.

Employed by MetLife, he was appointed manager of his own branch in 1994 due to his pioneering efforts to use The Bloomberg business computer as an insurance channel of distribution. He spoke of establishing an ''interactive, multi-media, office-shopping network.'' Mr. Daly was a board member of Ursinus College in Pennsylvania.
