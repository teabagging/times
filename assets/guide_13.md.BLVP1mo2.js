His training is in ballet, and he has performed with companies including the Eglevsky, American Festival Ballet and the Lexington Ballet. But the program failed to answer the question of why Mr. Witchel has chosen ballet for his medium of expression.   Some, John Selya and Clark Tippet among them, seem to choose to explore ballet as a kind of vital puzzle to be solved. A few seek to express dramatic themes or their own individuality. Mr. Witchel appears to have a love of order and formality that is met by ballet. It is clear he also has a fondness for scores others might not think to choreograph to.
