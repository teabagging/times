Nick Pastore, he will tell you, was \\"an outstanding patrol officer,\\" a \\"super crime-fighting cop,\\" \\"a good cop with the Mafia,\\" \\"Sherlock Holmes.\\"   Most of all, the man who has been police chief here for the last 20 months portrays himself as someone who inherited \\"a city out of control\\" and led it out of an iron-fisted law-enforcement tradition into the promised land of community-based policing. Campaigning on Crime    \\"I'm not a cop's cop,\\" he said. \\"I'm a people's cop. You understand what I'm saying?\\"   But turmoil over the Chief's flamboyant leadership as well as an ominously rising murder rate and random nightly gunfire -- including a shootout on the steps of police headquarters only weeks ago -- have led many to question whether this city of ivied Yale towers and concrete-block slums is on the right course.   On Tuesday, the city's first black Mayor, John C. Daniels, seeks a second term after a campaign in which crime has been the most volatile issue. Although figures show major crime down about 10 percent for much of this year compared to last, New Haven in 1990 ranked sixth in violent crime per capita in American cities with more than 100,000 residents. In October New Haven had an average of six reported gunfire incidents a day.   In effect, New Haven will also be choosing between two approaches to handling crime: whether to entrench, citywide, Chief Pastore's experiment with \\"problem-solving\\" foot patrols, an experiment on which the verdict remains out, or revert in large part to reactive policing by emergency-response radio cars and SWAT teams, as advocated by the Republican challenger, Alderman Jonathan J. Einhorn.   Perhaps in no city in America is the dichotomy in policing more clearly drawn, with the outcome of importance to departments around the country. Dean M. Esserman, a disciple of the guru of community policing, Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown of New York City, recently took the job of assistant chief here, with Mr. Brown attending his swearing in.   But the argument over the best way to fight crime in New Haven has been clouded by what amounts to warfare between the freewheeling Chief and his many disgruntled officers, backed by their union. He is treating them, they say, the authoritarian way he doesn't want them to treat the public.    \\"The cops clearly hate the Chief and they say it,\\" said Mr. Esserman, a former counsel to the New York City transit police, who has been working furiously to repair relations and win officers over to Chief Pastore's program.   In many ways the 53-year-old Chief has made himself, as much as his program, the issue. Describing the department he took over in February 1990 as \\"brain dead,\\" he has proceeded to turn it upside down, staging what he called a \\"coup\\" aimed at \\"ventilating\\" the 417-member force and wiping out the command echelon and a fifth of the ranks.    A popular commander was literally dispatched to the doghouse as head of the department's animal shelter. From banning leather gloves as too intimidating to ridiculing officers who lingered in doughnut shops to secretive motel room meetings with a shadowy \\"Mafia informant,\\" the irrepressible Chief has put his stamp on New Haven.    To protest disciplinary action against two officers whose shots killed a fleeing drug suspect, more than 60 officers came down with the \\"blue flu,\\" calling in sick on a weekend in September. Citing a \\"thunderous\\" no confidence vote in the Chief's leadership, the police union demanded his resignation, adding, \\"Please reserve a table at your retirement for the union executive board.\\"  The Troubled Years Politics, Wiretaps And a 'Stud Bus'    The confrontation in this ethnically diverse city of 130,500 on Long Island Sound, a city of communal neighborhoods and small-town familiarities, springs from years of political maneuvering and personal ambitions and animosities. Politics and the police, in particular, have long been intertwined.   In 1977, it was disclosed that the police had illegally wiretapped thousands of phones during the heyday of demonstrations against the Vietnam war, especially after the Black Panthers helped turn Yale into a center of protest. Mr. Pastore, who had joined the force in 1962 and briefly ran the wiretaps in 1968, was a star witness before a police board inquiry, an act for which some members of the force never forgave him.    By 1981, Mr. Pastore concluded he could not serve under the new Police Chief, William F. Farrell, a former Marine Corps officer. They were just incompatible, he recalled recently. Suffering from a kidney ailment and wary of what he said were \\"all those people around who were going to get Pastore,\\" he left the department as Chief of Operations after applying unsuccessfully for a medical disability pension.  Increasing Violence    Under Chief Farrell, whose office was adorned with military regalia and who still flies a Marine flag at his home near the coast, the department epitomized the reactive style of American policing of the time. Patrol cars raced from one emergency to another as officers fought a battle of containment against rampant drug-fueled violence. Cocaine was sold openly although New Haven was spared the epidemic of low-priced crack that devastated New York City starting in the mid 1980's.   Between 1987 and 1989 alone, complaints of robbery and aggravated assault each rose by about 50 percent. The number of murders annually rose from 23 to a record 34.    Yet the Police Department collected virtually no intelligence of its own and mounted no significant undercover operations. The existence of drug gangs, though well known to police officers, was officially denied, even in the face of a downtown gun battle between rival factions that had passers-by ducking bullets on the courthouse steps.    Meanwhile, a hard-pressed Police Department developed its own reputation for harsh tactics. A squad of officers hidden in a van known as the \\"stud bus\\" often descended on youths gathered on street corners, seizing or roughing up many without cause, according to widespread complaints. The unit was referred to on the streets as \\"the beat-down posse.\\"   Mr. Farrell, in an interview, said he believed in \\"being firm\\" but denied tolerating improper force. \\"You didn't have to have notches in your gun to go forward with me,\\" he said.   One incident in September 1989 -- never publicized -- occurred especially close to home: in the jail adjoining police headquarters downtown at One Union Avenue. Despair Over Crime    A jail clerk reported seeing an officer grab a handcuffed prisoner, a young man, by the neck and push him to a desk. \\"As I looked through the window I observed the police officer punching the prisoner in his back left side, the area of his kidney, and then punch him in the front portion of his left side,\\" she said in a complaint. At first she thought the officer was using brass knuckles. Police officials now say it was his keys.   An assault charge against the officer was dropped after the victim declined to testify. The officer, granted \\"accelerated rehabilitation\\" by the court, remains on the force.    Such incidents, coupled with despair over rising criminal violence, led in November 1989 to a new city regime espousing the politically catchy gospel of \\"community based\\" policing. Mr. Daniels, the new Mayor, was a State Senator and former Alderman who operated a plumbing company.    A report later written by two graduate students from the Yale School of Organization and Management quoted a senior Daniels adviser as saying that the campaign had advanced the idea of community-based policing to provide \\"a patina of technocracy\\" for the mayoral platform to appeal to New Haven's \\"progressive, intellectual community.\\"   Behind the scenes was Mr. Pastore. He spent the 1980's selling costume jewelry and, staked by large bank loans, investing heavily in real estate, including an ice cream parlor with a video game arcade in Madison, Conn. But when the real-estate downturn hit, he was sued by a variety of creditors for more than $2 million. Today, by his count, he owes $1.3 million and, hoping to avert bankruptcy, is looking for \\"a workout with the banks.\\"  Moving for 'Ventilation'    During the 1989 campaign, Mr. Pastore quietly advised Mr. Daniels, a friend from high school days. And the following February, after what was proclaimed to be a broad search, Mayor Daniels stunned New Haven by bringing Mr. Pastore back to the Police Department as chief.   Chief Pastore embarked quickly on his \\"ventilation.\\" He removed the shield of bulletproof glass separating the public from desk officers in the fortress-like police headquarters, made a show of throwing open his office door to members of the department and replaced martial symbols with a photograph of himself and Lee Brown. A large mural of police activities, done by a police artist and prized by Chief Farrell, was unceremoniously painted over on a weekend.    Among his first targets were some of the highest-ranking commanders, five of whom received a \\"golden handshake\\" giving them 75 percent of their pay as well as full health benefits for life -- well above the norm.   The sixth, former Comdr. Leonard Gallo -- who had been supervisor of patrol services, the street crime and drug unit, the harbor patrol, and was a graduate of Federal Bureau of Investigation and Secret Service programs -- suffered a more ignominious fate.    Refusing to be, as he put it, \\"pushed out\\" after 21 years -- even at $43,000 a year for life -- he was reassigned to the New Haven Animal Shelter and required to \\"stay abreast of trends in animal epidemiology\\" and design a system of \\"intake-to-release paperwork for all dogs.\\"    The Chief also earned the enmity of many officers by ejecting them from desk jobs to street duty. Some quit. A One-Man Operation The Chief Meets In the Shadows     In the spring of 1990, the Chief began an unusual operation of his own, one that would arouse the curiosity of a department lawyer and the Connecticut state police but was never made public. He rented rooms at the Holiday Inn in nearby Milford and met there with someone he later described as an informant on Mafia activities.    At the same time, he said last week, he used other rooms at the motel for personal purposes, putting up friends at a special rate he was granted and using the swimming pool, sometimes with his granddaughter.    According to bills reviewed by The New York Times, the informant operation cost the department thousands of dollars. The Chief said he never told anyone whom he was meeting with -- he gave conflicting descriptions of the person -- and never stayed overnight. He saved no notes or other record of the meetings but, he said last week, passed on to his aides information that became the basis of a continuing undercover operation into mob control of several small New Haven businesses. That operation produced several drug buys and would lead to arrests, the Chief said. But Assistant Chief Esserman said in a separate interview that the operation had been of little value and should be shut down.   An inquiry into the motel expenses began last fall after a lawyer for the Police Department was shown some of the bills by a disaffected police major, Thomas P. Muller, who questioned whether the chief was using the rooms for personal reasons. The lawyer, Glenn Coe, a former state prosecutor now in private practice in Hartford, was concerned enough to pass the matter on to the state police.    Bernard Sullivan, who was then State Police Superintendent, said recently that at a meeting in his office last November, he was told in general terms by the New Haven State's Attorney that Chief Pastore was engaged in a law-enforcement operation and so, before starting an investigation, dropped the matter with the questions unresolved. The New Haven prosecutor, Michael Dearington, declined to comment on the matter last week, and it remains unclear what he knew of Chief Pastore's use of the rooms.    If some officers question the wisdom of a police chief meeting on his own with mob informants, Chief Pastore has no qualms. He boasts he had 108 informants when he was detective commander years ago.   \\"I go anywhere in this community and speak to anyone at any time,\\" Chief Pastore said. \\"A Mafioso, a drug dealer, a whore, a pimp.\\"  The Future Nightsticks To Plowshares     The Chief created a sensation by giving an interview on drugs to a journalist who later sold the article to High Times, a magazine about the drug culture. In the interview, published in the August 1990 issue, the chief dismissed interdiction as a failure and urged: \\"Let's decriminalize and medicalize the problems.\\" Going further, the Chief has discouraged his officers from arresting first-time drug offenders, attempting to steer them toward treatment while helping to clear clogged court calendars.    \\"To this day,\\" he said in an interview in his office, \\"we don't police with tenderness, kindness, understanding. In fact, much of the problem in American society has been caused by mean policing that exacerbates, perpetuates and results in mean streets.\\" 'Service-Oriented' Officers    So the Chief is looking for more than a few good women -- along with more black and Hispanic recruits. The department now has 77 vacancies out of 417 slots, and the Chief has told the union he would welcome another hundred openings -- jobs that generally would not be filled, he said, with \\"young white males from the suburbs\\" or \\"adventure-type individuals.\\"    The Chief's aim is to fill the ranks with \\"service-oriented\\" officers who would staff the 12 permanent police substations he intends to open throughout New Haven -- the heart of his community policing program. From here, the officers would fan out through the neighborhoods, getting to know the residents, winning their trust and spotting problems before they fester.    In Chief Pastore's vision of \\"21st century policing,\\" Yale would replace jail. \\"You're not going to spend $30,000 for one black inmate,\\" he said. \\"You're going to send him to Yale. You're going to send him to the University of New Haven. Quality of life, that's the change.\\"   \\"Talk about the criminal mind,\\" he said. \\"If we could rechannel that into positive behavior. That's what I try to do all the time, modify people's behavior.\\"   After less than two years, the payoff from the Chief's approach is difficult to read from crime figures, which can be skewed by inaccurate reporting and are subject to differing interpretations. But overall the data show complaints are down.    With the 28th murder of the year on Monday, the city's homicide toll may top last year's 31 and approach or surpass 1989's record 34. On the positive side, reported robbery complaints were down 24 percent, rape complaints were down 21 percent and burglary complaints were down 14 percent, comparing the first eight months of 1991 to 1990. Assault complaints were level.   But in recent years the percentage of robberies with guns has increased from about a fifth to over a third. And the high number of assaults, 2,008 in 1990, contributed to making New Haven the most violence-ridden American city of 100,000 or over, per capita, after Miami, Atlanta, Newark, St. Louis, and Tampa, according to figures supplied to the F.B.I. New Haven had 3,059 reported violent crimes -- homicides, rapes, robberies and assaults -- per 100,000 people. New York City was far down on the list, with 2,384.   The Chief's program, real on the streets or still on the drawing board, has heartened many New Havenites. John R. Williams, a defense lawyer and longtime police critic who represented the plaintiffs in the wiretapping suit, has become -- somewhat to his amazement -- an admirer of Chief Pastore, calling his appointment \\"a brilliant move.\\" The Chief returns the compliment by saying that without Mr. Williams \\"us scoundrels would be out of control.\\"   To Bea Dozier-Taylor, a gallery and bookstore owner in the crime-scarred Dwight-Kensington neighborhood, where community policing has already started, the officers on patrol are forging \\"a unity with the community.\\" In the past, she said, the police were seen only in emergencies.   Sgt. Achilles Generoso, who supervises her area, said he was \\"no bleeding-heart liberal\\" but he had become a convert to community policing, describing it as \\"nothing more than common sense.\\" Nevertheless, Sergeant Generoso admits to dismay over the way he said Chief Pastore had stereotyped many officers as laggard. \\"I was angry with him,\\" he said.   Sergeant Cavalier, the union president and a 25-year-police veteran, said the anger against the Chief runs deep. \\"He puts officers in an area riddled with shootings and tells them to approach drug dealers to seek a better life,\\" he said. \\"The drug dealers are laughing at the police.\\"   In his office, still unpacking his papers from New York, the new assistant chief, Mr. Esserman, shrugged. He had heard the complaints, he said. He knew the problems. And he had advised the Chief to get closer to his officers. \\"Great men have great faults,\\" he said.

But plainly Director Louis Daquin is no Julien Duvivier or Jean Benoit-Levy with kids and the authors of his scenario are far from shrewd trans-scribers of childlife.For their genial little picture about a bunch of provincial French kids who drop their child's play and band together to absorb a seeming injustice from grown-ups, while sparkling and penetrating in flashes, is rather laboriously contrived. And it reflects the concepts of adults much more than those of kids. Some of the ways in which its youngsters raise money to pay the cost of damage to a school window accidentally done by one of the boys are not only ingenious but genuine, such as teaching other youngsters to speak slang or spraying peoples' shoes with muddy water so they'll have to patronize the shoe shine stands.However, the interrelation of youthful inventiveness with a fatuous adult romance, involving the usual triangular points, betrays adroit fabrication rather than an insight into kids. And the idea of juvenile unification under pressure from adults makes a pretty symbolization which is not wholly plausible.Some of the youngsters are well played, with Jean Pierre Geffroy and Georges Reygnier most conspicuously natural, but the performances of the adults are thoroughly superficial. Particularly, Pierre Larquey as a comical amateur detective is pure burlesque bait for laughs. Adequate English subtitles translate the French dialogue.

PETER WATROUS Juju, Updated    Sikiru Ayinde Barrister, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. African music, especially from Nigeria, had its moment here almost a decade ago. Musicians in Nigeria haven't heard the news, thankfully, and here comes Barrister, who updates the basic juju sound with a heavier drum section. It's trance music and dance music, and beautiful. It's extremely rare to hear it, so the shows are something special. Sets tomorrow are at 10 P.M. and midnight. There is a $10 cover charge. P. W. Randy Weston    Randy Weston, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Randy Weston is among jazz's great living pianists, and would be just for his touch, which has the percussive qualities of both Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk. He's an exceptional composer as well, having written some of the better ballads of the 1950's; his modern writing is rife with the influence of his African travels. As is his improvising: his rhythms, which he underscores with a judicious use of bright dissonances, can be thrilling. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 9, 11 and 12:30 (but no third set on Sunday). There is a $15 cover charge and a $10 minimum. P. W. Marion Brown Benefit    Benefit for Marion Brown, the Cooler, 416 West 14th Street, West Village, (212) 229-0785.

In her inimitable style, she will recite stories about the African diaspora in performances for the family program of the Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival. Ms. Whitney will be joined by Pearls of Wisdom, a group of elder female storytellers who like tales of courage, and who doesn't need to hear about that? They will perform at 3:45 P.M. tomorrow and Sunday.   Families can also try the festival's dance workshops tomorrow and Sunday. At 2 P.M. each day, Silvana Magda's Viva Brazil ensemble will show how to do the samba de roja, the original samba, in which you invite the person next to you to dance by bumping into him or her. (You can't be shy.) They will also teach the samba carioca, which has more hyped-up movements. Greek circular and line dancing reach back to the days of Helen of Troy, and at 3 P.M. the Greek-American Folklore Society will teach the basic 5/4 rhythm that this dancing is about. At 4 P.M. each day, the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers will teach round dancing, and at 5 P.M. you can learn contra dancing.   There's nearly a trainful of other entertainers, including Pete Seeger tomorrow at 7:30 conducting a 200-voice chorus, plus puppeteers and drummers throughout tomorrow and Sunday afternoon, all free. 'Fool Moon'  Richard Rodgers Theater  226 West 46th Street  Manhattan  (212) 307-4100  Recommended ages: 6 and up  Through Sept. 5    At the opening of this high-brow clown show, David Shiner, one of the two performers, climbs over a row of people, practically choking a man in the last seat. That leads to a burst of near-fisticuffs, which Mr. Shiner seems to encourage. He then moves through the audience, throwing people's clothes around while pushing them out of their seats. He's an aggressive clown, with a hatful of neurotic tics and an ability to mock people while making them want more. His partner, Bill Irwin, a clown who has received a MacArthur Fellowship, is a slyly humorous guy who in one act tries to seduce Mr. Shiner's date. In another act, he has infinite trouble putting a vest on","excerpt":"children can relate to that.   In fact, children can find a lot in common with Mr. Shiner and Mr. Irwin's antics. The two-hour show relies a lot on audience participation; during a recent show, a boy and a girl from the audience were enticed onto the stage to participate in an act with Mr. Irwin.   Tickets are available in all sections at most performances. Performances are Monday through Saturday at 8 P.M.; there are matinees on Wednesday and Saturday at 2 P.M. From Aug. 30 to Sept. 5, performances will be Tuesday through Saturday at 8 P.M., Wednesday and Saturday at 2 P.M. and Sunday at 3 P.M. Tickets are $25, $37.50 and $42.50 except for Friday and Saturday nights, when they are $32.50, $39.50 and $45. 'Girls and Girlhood' 'A Perilous Path'  United Nations Lobby  45th Street and First Avenue  Manhattan  (212) 759-0760  Recommended ages: 7 and up  Through Aug. 19    This small exhibition uses large, handsomely painted illustrations and photographs of girls around the world to show that they are not only different from boys but are also often treated in a petty way, as if they are, indeed, the second sex.   Against this colorful backdrop, which includes illustrations adapted from \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Linnea in Monet's Garden,\\" American girls can read facts about girls on the other side of the world. For example, 60 million girls do not have access to primary schools, compared with 40 million boys. In Java, girls work 30 percent more hours per day than boys do. In Bahrain, 50 percent of girls are married by age 15. Visitors may find that the photographs alone -- of street girls, girls selling flowers, a girl washing clothes in a murky river -- tell the story.   The free exhibition, a collaboration between Unicef and children's book authors, illustrators, publishers and photographers, suggests that the remedy is not to ignore the differences between boys and girls, but to identify and end discrimination in health care, play and schooling, and to promote self-esteem and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse.

Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. Justice Thurgood Marshall's dissenting opinion was joined by Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens. Justice David H. Souter took no part in the case. FROM THE OPINION By Chief Justice Rehnquist    Petitioner Board of Education of Oklahoma City sought dissolution of a decree entered by the District Court imposing a school desegregation plan. The District Court granted relief over the objection of respondents Robert L. Dowell, et al, black students and their parents. The Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit reversed, holding that the board would be entitled to such relief only upon \\" ' [ n ] othing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions. . . .' \\" We hold that the Court of Appeals test is more stringent than is required either by our cases dealing with injunctions or by the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. History of the Litigation     This school desegregation litigation began almost 30 years ago. In 1961, respondents, black students and their parents, sued petitioners, the Board of Education of Oklahoma City (Board), to end de jure segregation in the public schools. In 1963, the District Court found that Oklahoma City had intentionally segregated both schools and housing in the past, and that Oklahoma City was operating a \\"dual\\" school system -- one that was intentionally segregated by race.   In 1965, the District Court found that the School Board's attempt to desegregate by using neighborhood zoning failed to remedy past segregation because residential segregation resulted in one-race schools. Residential segregation had once been state imposed, and it lingered due to discrimination by some realtors and financial institutions. The District Court found that school segregation had caused some housing segregation.     In 1972, finding that previous efforts had not been successful at eliminating state-imposed segregation, the District Court ordered the Board to adopt the \\"Finger Plan,\\" under which kindergarteners would be assigned to neighborhood schools unless their parents opted otherwise","excerpt":"children in grades 1-4 would attend formerly all-white schools, and thus black children would be bused to those schools; children in grade 5 would attend formerly all-black schools, and thus white children would be bused to those schools; students in the upper grades would be bused to various areas to maintain integrated schools, and in integrated neighborhoods there would be stand-alone schools for all grades. Compliance for Five Years     In 1977, after complying with the desegregation decree for five years, the board made a \\"Motion to Close Case.\\" The District Court held in its \\"Order Terminating Case\\":   \\"The court has concluded that  [ the Finger Plan ]  worked and that substantial compliance with the constitutional requirements has been achieved. . . .   This unpublished order was not appealed.   In 1984, the School Board faced demographic changes that led to greater burdens on young black children. As more and more neighborhoods became integrated, more stand-alone schools were established and young black students had to be bused farther from their inner-city homes to outlying white areas.   In an effort to alleviate this burden and to increase parental involvement, the Board adopted the Student Reassignment Plan (SRP), which relied on neighborhood assignments for students in grade 1-4 beginning in the 1985-1986 school year. Busing continued for students in grades 5-12. . . .    In 1985, respondents filed a \\"Motion to Reopen the Case,\\" contending that the School District had not achieved \\"unitary\\" status and that the SRP was a return to segregation. Under the SRP, 11 of 64 elementary schools would be greater than 90 percent black, 22 would be greater than 90 percent white plus other minorities, and 31 would be racially mixed. . . .   .  ..     The District Court found that present residential segregation was the result of private decision making and economics, and that it was too attenuated to be a vestige of former school segregation. It also found that the district had maintained its unitary status and that the neighborhood assignment plan was not designed with discriminatory intent. The court concluded that the previous injunctive decree should be vacated and the School District returned to local control. 1932 Court Decision Cited     The Court of Appeals again reversed. . . . Relying on United States v. Swift & Co. (1932), it held that a desegregation decree remains in effect until a school district can show \\"grievous wrong evoked by new and unforseen conditions,\\" and \\"dramatic changes in conditions unforseen at the time of the decree that . . . impose extreme and unexpectedly oppressive hardships on the obligor.\\" Given that a number of schools under the SRP, circumstances in Oklahoma City had not changed enough to justify modification of the decree. . . .   We now reverse the Court of Appeals.   .  .  .   In Milliken v. Bradley (Milliken II) (1977), we said: \\" [ F ] ederal Court decrees must directly address and relate to the constitutional violation itself. Because of this inherent limitation upon Federal judicial authority, Federal Court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate the Constitution or does not flow from such a violation. . . .\\"   From the very first, Federal supervision of local school systems was intended as a temporary measure to remedy past discrimination. Brown considered the \\"complexities arising from the transition to a system of public education freed of racial discrimination\\" in holding that the implementation of desegregation was to proceed \\"with all deliberate speed.\\"    Considerations based on the allocation of powers within our Federal system, we think, support our view that quoted language from Swift does not provide the proper standard to apply to injunctions entered in school desegregation cases. Such decrees, unlike the one in Swift, are not intended to operate in perpetuity. Local control over the education of children allows citizens to participate in decision making, and allows innovation so that school programs can fit local needs. A Reasonable Period of Time     The legal justification for displacement of local authority by an injunctive decree in a school desegregation case is a violation of the Constitution by the local authorities. Dissolving a desegregation decree after the local authorities have operated in compliance with it for a reasonable period of time properly recognizes that \\"necessary concern for the important values of local control of public school systems dictates that a Federal Court's regulatory control of such systems not extend beyond the time required to remedy the effects of past intentional discrimination. . . .\\"   .  .  .     A District Court need not accept at face value the profession of a School Board which has intentionally discriminated that it will cease to do so in the future. But in deciding whether to modify or dissolve a desegregation decree, a School Board's compliance with previous court orders is obviously relevant. In this case the original finding of de jure segregation was entered in 1961, the injunctive decree from which the Board seeks relief was entered in 1972, and the Board complied with the decree in good faith until 1985.   Not only do the personnel of school boards change over time, but the same passage of time enables the District Court to observe the good faith of the School Board in complying with the decree. The test espoused by the Court of Appeals would condemn a school district, once governed by a board which intentionally discriminated, to judicial tutelage for the indefinite future. Neither the principles governing the entry and dissolution of injunctive decrees nor the commands of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment require any such Draconian result. Case Sent to District Court     Petitioners urge that we reinstate the decision of the District Court terminating the injunction, but we think that the preferable course is to remand the case to that court so that it may decide, in accordance with this opinion, whether the Board made a sufficient showing of constitutional compliance as of 1985, when the SRP was adopted, to allow the injunction to be dissolved. . . . The District Court should address itself to whether the Board had complied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination had been eliminated. . . .   In considering whether the vestiges of de jure segregation had been eliminated as far as practicable, the District Court should look not only at student assignments, but \\"to every facet of school operations -- faculty, staff, transportation extra-curricular activities and facilities. . . .\\"   After the District Court decides whether the Board was entitled to have the decree terminated, it should proceed to decide respondent's challenge to the SRP. A school district which has been released from an injunction imposing a desegregation plan no longer requires court authorization for the promulgation of policies and rules regulating matters such as assignment of students and the like, but it of course remains subject to the mandate of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. If the Board was entitled to have the decree terminated as of 1985, the District Court should then evaluate the Board's decision to implement the SRP under appropriate equal protection principles. FROM THE DISSENT By Justice Marshall    The majority today suggests that 13 years of desegregation was enough. The Court remands the case for further evaluation of whether the purposes of the injunctive decree were achieved sufficient to justify the decree's dissolution. However, the inquiry it commends to the District Court fails to recognize explicitly the threatened re-emergence of one-race schools as a relevant \\"vestige\\" of de jure segregation.   In my view, the standard for dissolution of a school desegregation decree must reflect the central aim of our school desegregation precedents. In Brown v. Board of Education, (1954) (Brown I), a unanimous Court declared that racially \\" [ s ] eparate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\\" This holding rested on the Court's recognition that state-sponsored segregation conveys a message of \\"inferiority as to th [ e ]  state  [ of Afro-American school children ]  in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.\\" Remedying this evil and preventing its recurrence were the motivations animating our requirement that formerly de jure segregated school districts take all feasible steps to eliminate racially identifiable schools.   I believe a desegregation decree cannot be lifted so long as conditions likely to inflict the stigmatic injury condemned in Brown I persist and there remain feasible methods of eliminating such conditions. Because the record here shows, and the Court of Appeals found, that feasible steps could be taken to avoid one-race schools, it is clear that the purposes of the decree have not yet been achieved and the Court of Appeals' reinstatement of the decree should be affirmed. I therefore dissent.   .  .  .     I agree with the majority that the proper standard for determining whether a school desegregation decree should be dissolved is whether the purposes of the desegregation litigation, as incorporated in the decree, have been fully achieved. . . . I strongly disagree with the majority, however, on what must be shown to demonstrate that a decree's purposes have been fully realized. In my view, a standard for dissolution of a desegregation decree must take into account the unique harm associated with a system of racially identifiable schools and must expressly demand the elimination of such schools.   .  .  .     Just as it is central to the standard for evaluating the formation of a desegregation decree, so should the stigmatic injury associated with segregated schools be central to the standard for dissolving a decree. The Court has indicated that \\"the ultimate end to be brought about\\" by a desegregation remedy is \\"a unitary, nonracial system of public education.\\" The Message of Inferiority     We have suggested that this aim is realized once school officials have \\"eliminate [ d ]  from the public schools all vestiges of state-imposed segregation,\\" whether they inhere in the school's \\"faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities and facilities,\\" or even in \\"the community and administration [ 's ]  attitudes toward  [ a ]  school.\\"    Although the Court has never explicitly defined what constitutes a \\"vestige\\" of state-enforced segregation, the function that this concept has performed in our jurisprudence suggests that it extends to any condition that is likely to convey the message of inferiority implicit in a policy of segregation. So long as such conditions persist, the purposes of the decree cannot be deemed to have been achieved.   The majority suggests a more vague and, I fear, milder standard. . . .   By focusing heavily on present and future compliance with the Equal Protection Clause, the majority's standard ignores how the stigmatic harm identified in Brown I can persist even after the state ceases actively to enforce segregation. . . .    In sum, our school desegregation jurisprudence establishes that the effects of past discrimination remain chargeable to the school district regardless of its lack of continued enforcement of segregation, and the remedial decree is required until those effects have been finally eliminated.   Applying the standard I have outlined, I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision ordering the District Court to restore the desegregation decree. For it is clear on this record that the removal of the decree will result in a significant number of racially identifiable schools that could be eliminated.   .  .  .     Against the background of former state sponsorship of one-race schools, the persistence of racial identifiable schools perpetuates the message of racial inferiority associated with segregation. Therefore, such schools must be eliminated whenever feasible.   .  ..     Consistent with the mandate of Brown I, our cases have imposed on school districts an unconditional duty to eliminate any condition that perpetuates the message of racial inferiority inherent in the policy of state-sponsored segregation. The racial identifiability of a district's schools is such a condition. Whether this \\"vestige\\" of state-sponsored segregation will persist cannot simply be ignored at the point where a District Court is contemplating the dissolution of a desegregation decree. In a district with a history of state-sponsored school segregation, racial separation, in my view, remains inherently unequal.

NEW JERSEY GUIDE"},{"year":"1990","title":"The Mellow Pages    Like a wine that spends extra time in bottle or barrel, the bimonthly newsletter Wine and Food Companion has become easier to enjoy after two years. It has a more attractive format, and its approach to matching food and wine is more relaxed.   Instead of deciding which wines are best with a particular dish, David Rosengarten and Joshua Wesson, the publishers, approach whole categories, like Chinese food, with more general and sensible advice.    There are more recipes with wine suggestions and more reviews of restaurants. But capsule reviews by correspondents in American and foreign cities lack information on prices and, often, wine lists. And in case wine lovers do not have enough guidance from wine ratings published by Robert Parker and The Wine Spectator and the like, there are still more ratings of the 1989 Bordeaux, among other categories, to chew on.    Mr. Rosengarten and Mr. Wesson have also come up with a bimonthly Companion Wine Review, a newsletter that evaluates hundreds of wines. Subscriptions to either publication are $36 a year, $49 for both. For information, call (800) 888-1961. Big Apples    The most gigantic apples in the Big Apple are Mrs. Prindable's apples on a stick sold at Saks Fifth Avenue. Each apple is as big as a softball, weighing about a pound. And the apples under the incrustation of assorted candy coatings are super-deluxe Delicious apples that are indeed delicious, crisp and fairly tart.   But forget about eating them on the stick. One apple sliced in wedges could easily serve four.    The coatings include toffee, milk and dark chocolate, coconut and cookie pieces. The apples are $12 each.  Westchester Festival    On Sunday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., the Westchester County Center on Tarrytown Road in White Plains will become a food festival. Chefs Day, sponsored by the local chapter of the American Culinary Federation, involves nearly 100 chefs giving cooking demonstrations. Sample tastes of cheeses, chocolates, sausages and other foods will be available from about 25 producers.   Admission is $5","excerpt":"children under 12 are free. Venison Sausage    Venison is definitely the new meat on the block, appearing with increasing frequency on restaurant menus and available at some butcher shops. Now there is a salami-style smoked venison sausage from Millbrook Venison Products, a venison farm in Millbrook, N.Y., that is being sold in many shops throughout the region. The sausage is being made for the farm according to its recipe. The venison is dark, rich and tangy, delicious with a lusty stein of good, malty beer to celebrate Oktoberfest.    In Manhattan, the sausage is sold at Ideal Cheese, 1205 Second Avenue at 63d Street, for $19.80 a pound, and at Delmonico's, 55 East 59th Street, for $20 a pound.    On Long Island, it is available at Prime Concern, 17 Middleneck Road, Great Neck, for $18 a pound and at S & D Cheese, 312 Sunrise Highway, Rockville Centre for $20 a pound. At the Market Basket, 813 Franklin Lakes Road, Franklin Lakes, N.J., it is $15.95 a pound.   The sausage can also be ordered whole or sliced for $11.95 a pound directly from Millbrook Venison Products by calling (914) 677-8457. There is a shipping charge of $10 an order. The Deer Hunter    John Doherty, the executive chef at the Waldorf-Astoria, seems to have created a side specialty for himself: giving cooking classes designed to appeal to men. His latest is for hunters who have bagged a deer.    On Thursday, Nov. 8, at 5:30 P.M., in the hotel kitchen, he will talk about cuts of venison and how to prepare them. He will even show how to smoke venison.    Although he cannot legally prepare hunted venison in the restaurant kitchen (no commercial establishment can), he will discuss how to combat the gaminess of wild venison.    At the end of the class the participants will feast on an autumn venison dinner. The cost of the class is $69. Reservations can be made by calling the chef's office, (212) 872-4866. PRICES NOW AND THEN    COMPLAINING about higher food prices? It depends on how you look at it.   The United States Department of Agriculture said that in 1989 prices for food increased 5.8 percent, the most since 1981. For food consumed at home, the increase was 4.2 percent; restaurant prices rose 6.5 percent.   Consumers spent $440 billion on food, or 11.6 percent of disposable income. But if that sounds like a lot, consider that the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that at the turn of the century, when life was simpler and the mailbox was not stuffed with car and cable television bills, as much as 40 percent of a family's income was spent on food. In 1960, it was 17.6 percent.   Last year's increases were higher for poultry than for meat or seafood because of the demand for chicken by fast-food chains. On average, 24 percent of the price of an item goes to the farmer or fisherman; the rest covers processing, packaging, advertising and distribution, with labor a major part of these expenses.

Punctuated with serio-comic flashbacks to the 1960's, it deals with a loss of family unity through death, divorce and illness. The seriousness of the situations is relieved by the comic personalities of the characters, Ms. Palmer said.   The protagonist is Joanne, a young writer facing the death of her grandmother. The title refers to a horse about whom the grandmother dreams as a symbol of her hopes for Joanne's future.   \\"When we did the play two years ago people laughed and cried in all the right places,\\" said Ms. Palmer. \\"And I had Jewish and black members of the audience tell me how alike the characters were to people in their families.

Bar-Ilan University in Israel and its American Friends mourn with deepest sorrow the passing of one of its most beloved and distinguished leaders, Dr. (honoris causa) Alfred Mackler, and extends profound condolences to his beloved wife, Helen, their children and grandchildren, & to his surviving sister, Charlotte. A prominent member of the Bar-Ilan Global Board of Trustees, Alfred Mackler personified the greatest ideals of leadership & commitment to the Jewish people. He served with distinction for several decades as Secretary and Treasurer of the American Board of Trustees, and as the accountant and national administrator for Bar-Ilan's U.S. operation. In recognition of his vital contributions to the University's growth and development, he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Bar-Ilan. A man of singular integrity and tact, his involvement in every aspect of university activity established a standard of excellence for others to follow. Through the Joseph Alexander Foundation, the Macklers are major Bar-Ilan university benefactors who have made possible the establishment of the Joseph Alexander Memorial Library in the Department of Social Sciences, the expansion of the Maria Finkle and Ruth Rackman Student Couseling Center, and many other vital projects. We extend heartfelt condolences to the Alexander Foundation Trustees-his wife, Helen, his son, Harvey, Bob Weintraub, and Arthur Alfert. A consummate gentleman and an individual of impeccable personal character, he was loved and respected by faculty, students, lay leaders and staff alike. His interpersonal relationships exemplified, as he did in his home, the beautiful family values he cherished-values shared by Helen.

Its symptoms include mild to severe bewilderment, painful indecision and a high degree of perplexity. Victims of the illness suffer frequent attacks in bookstores, where they can be seen thrashing about aimlessly near the shelves of children's books.
