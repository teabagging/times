The Portuguese fortified Bahrain in the 16th century but were driven out by the Persian shah Abbas I early in the 17th century. At the end of the 18th century, it became an Arab sheikhdom within the Ottoman Empire. Bahrain entered into treaty relations with Great Britain in 1820 and became a British protectorate in 1861. After British forces withdrew from the gulf, the nation became an independent emirate, in August 1971, under Amir Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, who had come to the throne in 1961. The U.S. has maintained a large military base here for many years. Oil reserves—first discovered in 1932—were depleted by the mid-1970's. The economy diversified to include oil refining, aluminum smelting, international banking, and shipping. Bahrain has close relations with Saudi Arabia; a causeway permits direct communication between them. In June 1995 social and political unrest caused by uneven distribution of wealth, high unemployment, and a repressive government erupted into serious rioting. Protests by the Shiite majority began again in early 1996; a government crackdown led to the arrest of over 600 dissidents. Bahrain's family-run, Sunni Muslim government continued with the March 1999 death of its founding emir and his replacement with his son, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa. The new emir, in Feb. 2001, fostered a trio of reform measures: extending amnesty to 400 political prisoners and repatriation to 100 exiles; repealing the State Security Law and abolishing the State Security Court, both of which had been designed to quash Shiite unrest; and sponsoring a referendum which approved (by 98 percent) the restoration of a parliament, the founding of an independent judiciary, and the extension of the right to vote to women. Then, in Feb. 2002, Sheik Hamad declared the state to be a constitutional monarchy, the Kingdom of Bahrain, with himself as king. Municipal elections were successfully held in May, with elections for the lower house of the legislature in Oct. giving Sunni candidates 19 of 40 seats.

The home of some of the world's most ancient centers of civilization, Syria was successively part of the Hittite, Assyrian, and Persian empires. At various times it was conquered by the Babylonians and the Egyptians. From about 1250 B.C., the coastal cities came under Phoenician rule. Alexander the Great brought Syria into the Hellenic world with his conquests in 332 B.C. After the fall of the Alexandrian empire, Syria came under the domain of the Seleucid empire but was constantly threatened by the Hellenic kingdom of Egypt, based in Alexandria. In the classical period, Syria embraced a much larger territory than that of the present Syrian nation; it included the entire Levant and parts of present-day Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Jordan. Greater Syria was conquered by Rome in 63 B.C. Under Roman rule the oasis region of Palmyra grew into a powerful semiautonomous kingdom. With the division of the Roman Empire in the fourth century A.D., Syria became part of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods, the country was an important center of Christianity. Syria was one of the first areas conquered when Islam began expansion from Arabia; Islamic rule was established by 636. From 661 to 751, Damascus was the center of the Caliphate, the ruling body of the Islamic world. By the late 11th century, the Seljuk Turks had conquered Syria. The large Syrian Christian population welcomed the European Crusaders as liberators from the Turks, but both Christians and Turks were defeated by the Arab general Saladin in the late 12th century. Saladin's rule was followed by that of the Mamluk empire of Egypt. During the Mamluk period, Mongol armies twice invaded Syria, in the mid-13th century and at the turn of the 15th century. An Ottoman army defeated the Mamluks in Syria in 1516, making Syria part of the Ottoman Empire. In the 18th century, France declared itself the protector of Syria's Christian community against Ottoman abuses. Napoleon invaded Syria in 1799 but withdrew after a brief occupation. In the 1830's Egyptian troops occupied Syria but were forced to withdraw under pressure from the European powers. Syrian nationalist aspirations emerged as the Ottoman Empire began to crumble before World War I. During the war the British encouraged Syrians to rebel against Turkish rule. After World War I, France governed both Syria and Lebanon under a League of Nations mandate. Under French rule, the region was divided into small territorial states along communal lines; Lebanon became independent in 1926. After prolonged negotiations much of Syria was organized into a semiautonomous state in 1930–32. In June 1940 the French administration in Syria declared its loyalty to the Vichy government. British and Free French forces invaded in June 1941, and an independent Syrian republic was established in September 1941. Separately administered territories were consolidated with the republic over the next two years, and full independence was declared on Jan. 1, 1944; foreign troops did not withdraw, however, until April 1946. Syria became a founding member of the Arab League and participated in the first Arab-Israeli War in 1948. An armistice with Israel was signed in July 1949. Severe political instability marked the early years of Syrian independence; the government was overthrown by military coups three times in 1949 alone. Most of Syria's Jews emigrated to Israel before or during 1948, and much of its once-substantial Christian population has emigrated also. Syrian politics remain dominated by communal concerns, however; the Arab majority is divided into Sunni, Shiite, Alawite, and Druze communities. Syria and Egypt merged as the United Arab Republic in February 1958; Syria seceded from the federation on Sept. 30, 1961. In Mar. 1963 a military coup established the pan-Arab Socialist Baath party in power; all other political parties were abolished. The Baath party leadership is dominated by the minority Alawite community. Pres. Hafez al-Assad took power on Feb. 22, 1971. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War (the Six Day War), Israel seized and held the Golan Heights region of Syria, from which Syria had long shelled Israeli communities and military installations. The Golan Heights have since been incorporated into Israeli territory. Syrian troops aided Palestinian forces fighting government troops in Jordan in September 1970. After the expulsion of Palestinian forces from Jordan in July 1971, Syria broke off relations with Jordan; relations were restored in 1975. On Oct. 6, 1973, Syrian and Egyptian forces attacked Israel, touching off the third Arab-Israeli War, the Yom Kippur War. A cease-fire took effect on Oct. 24; Syria failed to regain territory lost to Israel in 1967. Following the 1973 war, Syria became a major recipient of economic aid from the Arab oil states and of military equipment from the Soviet Union. In 1976 Syrian troops entered Lebanon in an attempt to mediate a civil war there and became enmeshed in that conflict. Major fighting between Syrian troops and Lebanese Christian militiamen broke out in April 1981. On June 6, 1982, Israeli troops invaded Lebanon and engaged Syrian troops in a five-day war in the Bekaa Valley. Following serious losses of aircraft and troops, Syria agreed to a cease-fire with Israel on June 11. Syrian troops continue to occupy parts of Lebanon. An attempted coup, in February 1982, by the Muslim Brotherhood, led to serious fighting within Syria, but the rebellion was put down; casualties topped 5,000 on both sides. From the time of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War (the Yom Kippur War), Syria consistently adopted a radical stance in Middle Eastern politics, rejecting the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli accord and all other attempts at Arab-Israeli reconciliation. Supporting radical movements within the Palestine Liberation Organization, Syria aided Palestinian militants in driving Yasir Arafat's centrist faction of the PLO from its headquarters in Tripoli in 1983. The government was implicated in various acts of international terrorism in support of Palestinian, Libyan, and Iranian causes. Syria played a major role in the Lebanese peace process and accommodating a peace settlement between rival Shiite militias. Syria also took part in the anti-Iraq coalition in 1990–91, sending 20,000 troops to Saudi Arabia, as well as mobilizing forces on its common border with Iraq. Syria in 1994 made serious efforts toward achieving peace in the Middle East, including an offer to normalize relations in exchange for a return of the Golan Heights. But talks between the two countries were suspended after several bombings by the militant Islamic group Hamas. In Oct. 1998, Syria reached an accord with Turkey; with 10,000 Turkish troops massed on Syria's border, Syria agreed to cease supporting Kurdish rebels. The legislative elections in Dec. 1998 contained no surprises: Assad's National Progressive Front won all 167 seats that they chose to contest. Then, in Feb. 1999, Assad himself won, with 99.95 percent approval in his sole candidacy, election to a fifth seven-year term as president. A cabinet shake-up in March 2000 produced 22 new members among the 36 under new premier Mohammed Mustafa Zubi just three months before the death of Assad. After his 30 years of rule, the government backed his son (and armed forces commander) Bashar al-Assad, 34. Syria"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: southeastern Europe.

The city of Epidamnus (Durrës) was colonized by Greeks from Corinth and Corcyra in 625 B.C. Later the Roman province of Illyricum, Albania was a much-coveted area after the fall of Rome and was in turn ruled by Byzantines, Normans, Venetians, Slavs, and the kings of Naples. Under the leadership of Skanderbeg (1405–68), Albania repelled repeated Turkish invasions. But Albania was part of the Ottoman Empire from 1478 until 1912. Ottoman rule succeeded in converting most of the populace to Islam (with Catholic minorities in the north and Greek Orthodox in the south) but did not destroy the Albanian sense of national identity, based on ties of tribe, clan, and family. Independence came in 1912 as a result of the First Balkan War, when Austria-Hungary and Italy fostered the creation of an Albanian state. Occupied by its sponsors during World War I, Albania emerged from the war in a state of near-anarchy. With Yugoslav support, Ahmed Zogu became president of the republic in 1924; he proclaimed himself King Zog I in 1928. In 1939 Italy invaded and annexed Albania. During World War II, partisan resistance was dominated by Communist forces under the leadership of Enver Hoxha. In 1944 Hoxha seized control of the government. A socialist republic was established in 1946: foreigners were expelled and their assets nationalized; churches were closed; agriculture and industry were collectivized. Albania under Hoxha became one of the world's most thoroughly totalitarian states. A doctrinaire Stalinist, Hoxha broke with Khruschev's Soviet Union in 1961 and became a client state of China. But with liberalization in China after 1977, Hoxha broke that link as well. Albania became almost totally isolated from world affairs. Hoxha died in 1985 and was succeeded as president and first secretary of the Albanian Communist party by Ramiz Alia. In 1990, Alia eased restrictions on religion, tourism, and foreign investment, and allowed the formation of an opposition Democratic party. But he scheduled elections to the National Assembly for 1991, before awareness had spread of the old regime's faltering power. The Communists carried the rural districts and formed a coalition government with the Democrats, who carried the cities. In 1992, the Democrats completed the rout of the Communists, winning 92 of the 140 seats in the Assembly, and replacing Alia with Sali Berisha, a heart surgeon. But by the end of the year, factions within the Democratic party were already complaining about Pres. Berisha's “autocratic rule.” Meanwhile, anarchy plagued much of the country, with food riots in the cities and armed brigandage in the countryside. EC and U.N. grants helped pay for needed imports and Italy provided invaluable assistance to the Albanian police forces. By 1993, zones of law and order were being established, churches were reopening, and 90 percent of farming had been privatized. But in November 1994, voters rejected (54-42) a new constitution proposed by Pres. Berisha. In 1996 Berisha's Democratic Party won a major electoral victory amidst complaints of fraud, but he and his followers were driven from office in 1997 after a series of pryamid schemes collapsed ruining the finances of tens of thousands of families who had participated in them. Violence and looting occured in many areas and a multi-national force of 7,000 was sent in to help restore order. The Socialists (formerly Communists) returned to power under Fatos Nano. In the spring of 1998 NATO advisors began to train Albania's tiny army as ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo province of Yugoslavia began a violent rebellion. Yugoslavia's suppression of the rebellion drove thousands of ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo into Albania. Amidst this further tumult, internal struggles continued between supporters of the Democratic Party and the Socialists, erupting into serious violence in Sept. 1998. Though Nano resigned as prime minister late in 1998, he has continued to dominate Albanian politics as Socialist Party chairman, while prime ministers come and go.

Georgia is a land of rugged natural beauty, renowned for its famous war heroes and its hospitality. Georgia's most famous son, Iosif Djugashvili, known as Josef Stalin, was born in the mountain village of Gori in 1879. The name of Georgia derives from the Persian name for the native people, Gorj. An independent state was founded in the fourth century B.C. following the conquest of the Persian Empire by Alexander III. Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century A.D. Both the Georgian language and the capital city of Tbilisi date from the fifth century A.D. The Georgian people, whose main occupation was cattle raising and agriculture, began to develop feudal states in the sixth century. Georgia's later history, however, is one of almost continuous foreign domination. In the 12th century, Georgia gained independence from the Persian Empire, but it came under Mongol rule in 1236. For centuries Georgia was a battleground between Turks and Persians, and the territory was ultimately divided into principalities, some under the control of Persia and some under Turkey. In 1801, the Persian principalities were absorbed into the Russian empire, and by the end of the century the remaining Georgian state under Turkish domination was annexed to Russia. Once the Russian Empire collapsed in 1917 with the Bolshevik revolution, independent Georgia was once again proclaimed in May 1918. It was dominated by Mensheviks (from the Russian word “minority,” as opposed to Bolshevik, meaning “majority”), whose hold on power was short-lived. Although the Soviet Union and Georgia signed a treaty in May 1920 agreeing on their respective borders, the Soviet Red Army came into Georgia and forcibly incorporated it into the Soviet Union as a Socialist republic in early 1921. In 1922 it was made part of the Transcaucasian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic with Armenia and Azerbaijan, and in 1936 it became one of the U.S.S.R.'s union republics. The Georgians have always been fiercely nationalistic, even in the face of the U.S.S.R.'s “one Soviet people” policy. Georgian pride was evident from the first demonstrations against “russification” in 1956, and again in 1978 when the rewritten U.S.S.R. constitution attempted to weaken the status of Georgian language. In 1988, during Gorbachev's policy of “glasnost,” or openness, great numbers of Georgians began to call for sovereignty. Even as Georgia fought for its independence from the U.S.S.R., the autonomous provinces of Abkhazia, Adzharia, and South Ossetia began fighting for independence from Georgia. Tensions continue to run high in Adzharia, where allegiances to Islam frighten many in Christian Georgia, and in South Ossetia, which is struggling to end its association with Georgia and to unite with North Ossetia in the Russian Federation. But the greatest conflict raged in Abkhazia, the home region of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who was elected the country's first president in May 1991, but ousted from office seven months later. Fighting between the Georgian army and troops loyal to Gamsakhurdia continued from 1991 to 1993, resulting in more than 2,000 casualties, including Gamsakhurdia, until Pres. Eduard Shevardnadze persuaded Parliament to give him emergency powers to quell the insurgency. His political power consolidated, Shevardnadze began to renew ties to Russia. In 1994 he agreed to a cooperation pact to increase Russia's military influence in his country and, over the objections of the opposition National Radical party, Parliament ratified Georgia's membership in the Commonwealth of Independent States. In Aug. 1995 Parliament overwhelmingly approved a new “strong president” constitution. And in Nov. 1995 Shevardnadze easily won election to a new five-year term, while his two-party coalition captured close to 80 percent of the seats in Parliament. But continued instability in Abkhazia, the presence of Russian troops, and several assasination attempts on Shevardnadze left future development in doubt. Still, Shevardnadze easily won reelection in April 2000 and in June, Georgia became the WTO's 137th member. After firing his entire cabinet in Nov. 2001, Shevardnadze announced that U.S. troops (to reach a total of 1,200) were arriving (Apr. 2002) to train Georgian troops in the struggle against Muslim separatists.

Equatorial Guinea consists of the Mbini River basin on the West African coast, and a number of offshore islands, chiefly Bioko and Pagalu (Annobón). Indigenous Pygmies were displaced beginning in the 17th century by migrations of various peoples that now inhabit the coastal region and by the Fang, who comprise 80 percent of the present population. Bioko was discovered in 1473 by the Portuguese explorer Fernando Po, and until modern times the island bore his name. Portugal controlled the islands and adjacent mainland, exploiting them for the slave trade, until 1778 when the territory was ceded to Spain. Equatorial Guinea remained underdeveloped because of conflicting territorial claims and a lack of Spanish investment. Eventually, however, a plantation system was developed for the cultivation of cocoa, particularly on Bioko, using workers imported from Nigeria. In 1959 the Spanish territories in the Gulf of Guinea were given status equivalent to a province of Spain. Investment in education, health care facilities, and other social programs, combined with the flourishing plantation economy, made the territory one of the most prosperous and best educated in West Africa. Local autonomy came in 1963, full independence in 1968. Francisco Macias Nguema was elected Equatorial Guinea's first president in 1968. In 1970 he dissolved all opposition parties and declared a one-party state, and in 1972 proclaimed himself president for life and commenced rule by decree. During the next seven years, a reign of terror resulted in the death or exile of one-third of the country's people. Nigerian workers, along with other foreigners, were expelled from the country in 1976; without their labor and technical skills, the economy was quickly ruined. Macias Nguema was overthrown in August 1979 in a military coup led by his nephew, Lt. Col. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. Macias Nguema was tried and executed a month later. The new leader moved to reduce Soviet influence and to improve relations with Spain. A new constitution was approved in a referendum in August 1982 and again in 1991, the latter calling for a multiparty political system. Nguema, however, retains firm control. Economic prospects have improved with the discovery of oil reserves estimated at over 65 million barrels a year.

Geneva – Lodging for Under 100 Euros a Night"},{"year":"2006","title":"WHY GO NOW -- When it comes to contemporary art and architecture, Basel, Switzerland, seems an unlikely hotbed. Hugging a bend of the Rhine River, where Switzerland, France and Germany meet, this picturesque enclave of fewer than 200,000 residents has both the quaintness of a small town and the no-frills pragmatism of the Swiss.      But tens of thousands of art lovers can't be wrong. From June 14 through 18, artists, collectors and dealers from around the world will descend on this city for the 37th annual Art Basel (www.artbasel.com), the mother ship of contemporary art fairs.      While its four-year-old American offshoot, Art Basel Miami Beach, has quickly gained a reputation as the art crowd's sun-soaked, Champagne-drenched answer to Cannes, the original Art Basel (in Basel) remains a more buttoned-up affair. Nevertheless, with an expected attendance of more than 50,000, satellite fairs like Liste and Volta and a growing number of ancillary events, this year's fair is taking on shades of the Miami spinoff. For starters, Design Miami -- a design sideshow that was first held in Miami last December and featured big-ticket works by Jean Prouvé, Charlotte Perriand and Ron Arad -- is being replicated in Basel this year.      One need not rub so many shoulders, however, to enjoy the city's cultural offerings. Flush with pharmaceutical money (Novartis and Roche have headquarters there), Basel is home to an astounding array of museums and important art collections that are accessible year-round. It is also a showcase for new architecture, best exemplified by the cache of noteworthy buildings throughout the city by the hometown firm of Herzog & de Meuron.      Basel may be small in size, but its creative pulse and overheated arts scene are more befitting of a teeming metropolis.    WHERE TO STAY -- Basel is not kind to procrastinators, so book rooms far in advance. The city is host to numerous trade fairs and conventions, during which hotels fill up quickly and room rates can skyrocket. In the worst-case scenario, many visitors wind up staying in nearby cities like Zurich. In the best case, they get a riverfront room at Les Trois Rois (Blumenrain 8","excerpt":"41-61-260-5050; www.lestroisrois.com). Having completed a top-to-bottom makeover in March, this plush and luxurious hotel has been restored to its 19th-century grandeur. Doubles start at 590 Swiss francs ($482, at 1.23 francs to the dollar).      Also recently renovated, but considerably less expensive, is the Hotel Krafft (Rheingasse 12; 41-61-690-9130; www.hotelkrafft.ch). It has a very good restaurant overlooking the Rhine, and its rooms, which are sparsely decorated with warm woods and modern furnishings, start at 230 francs for a double. Another popular hotel is Der Teufelhof (Leonhardsgraben 49; 41-61-261-1010; www.teufelhof.com). The lobby might look like a retirement-home cafeteria, but the rooms, which start at 255 francs for a double, offer contemporary comfort and fanciful artists' touches, like oversized sheet music wallpaper.    WHERE TO EAT -- Basel does not suffer for lack of good restaurants. The Michelin-starred Stucki Bruderholz (Bruderholzallee 42; 41-61-361-8222; www.stucki-bruderholz.ch) is a French institution designed like a country villa, with prices -- medallions of lamb for 75 francs, for example -- to match. The check might be easier to take at Chez Donati (St. Johanns-Vorstadt 48, 41-61-322-0919), an art world standby that serves Italian fare like shrimp ravioli (28 francs) in an elegant interior outfitted with works on paper by Willem de Kooning, Richard Serra and others.     A convivial if somewhat noisy atmosphere can be found at Bodega zum Strauss (Barfüsserplatz 16; 41-61-261-2272), which is popular with the beer-chugging crowd -- that is to say, everyone. A favorite dish is the osso bucco for 29 francs. And while trendy is not a word that often applies to Basel, it aptly describes two restaurants that recently opened there. The intimate Johann (St. Johanns-Ring 34; 41-61-321-3232; www.johanns.ch) offers concrete gray minimalism along with an ever-changing menu that might include seared tuna loin (23 francs) or rack of lamb (43 francs). The sprawling and ultramodern Noohn (Henric Petri-Strasse 12; 41-61-281-1414; www.noohn.ch) serves reasonably priced pan-Asian dishes. In its futuristic sushi bar, small plates glide around the counter on an invisible conveyor belt (the secret lies in concealed magnets).    WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY -- It's nearly impossible to look up in Basel without seeing a museum, whether it's of fine arts, dolls, cartoons or even paper. Start at the Kunstmuseum Basel (St. Alban-Graben 16, 41-61-206-6262; www.kunstmuseumbasel.ch), which holds the world's largest collection of Hans Holbein paintings (a one-man show is on view through July 2). The 10-franc ticket also gets you into the Museum für Gegenwartskunst (St. Alban-Rheinweg 60; 41-61-206-6262; www.kunstmuseumbasel.ch), which specializes in post-1960's artists like Joseph Beuys, Robert Gober and Matthew Barney. For art that's strictly of the moment, head to Kunsthalle Basel (Steinenberg 7; 41-61-206-9900, www.kunsthallebasel.ch). And for Jean Tinguely fans, there's the Museum Tinguely (Paul Sacher-Anlage 1; 41-61-681-9320; www.tinguely.ch).     There's more on the must-see museum circuit. Take the No. 6 tram to the Foundation Beyeler (Baselstrasse 101; 41-61-645-9700; www.beyeler.com), a Renzo Piano-designed gallery that houses an extraordinary collection of Picassos, Cézannes, Rothkos and Légers -- as well as special exhibitions like ''Matisse: Figure, Color, Space,'' now through July 9. This summer, it would also be inexcusable to miss the Schaulager (Ruchfeldstrasse 19; 41-61-335-3232; www.schaulager.org). Built as art storage for a private foundation, this spectacular Herzog & de Meuron-designed institution offers only one exhibition a year. Currently on display (through Sept. 24) are the contemporary artists Tacita Dean and Francis Als.      Finally, save that last bit of energy for the Vitra campus, 20 minutes away by bus in Weil am Rhein, Germany (Charles-Eames-Strasse 1; 49-7621-702-3200; www.design-museum.de). Vitra, the famous furniture maker, has turned its assembly plant into an architectural wonderland with buildings by Zaha Hadid, Tadao Ando, Jean Prouvé and others. The Vitra Design Museum, done by Frank Gehry, currently has an excellent exhibition on the Italian mid-century designer Joe Colombo (until Sept. 10).    WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT -- During the art fair, virtually everyone winds up at the Kunsthalle's Campari Bar and its leafy outdoor garden (Steinenberg 7; 41-61-272-8383), where minor aristocrats and other heirs and heiresses have been known to steadily lose composure as the night unfolds.      Cargo Bar (St. Johanns-Rheinweg 46; 41-61-321-0072; www.cargobar.ch) is a riverfront hangout that's popular with the distressed jeans and ironic T-shirt crowd. On weekends, the Swiss hipsters can be found taking the long and dark walk through an old railyard, toward two other joints: nt*/Lounge (Erlenstrasse 21; 41-61-683-3546; www.areal.org), a stylish electronica venue, and Wagenmeister (Erlenstrasse 23; 41-61-683-9677; www.wagenmeister.ch), a punk-edged pub decorated with rusty steel drums.      For a mellower place to unwind, ride the elevator to Bar Rouge (Messeplatz 10; 41-61-361-3031; www.barrouge.ch), a red-swathed lounge with 31st-floor views of the city. Or, for those who haven't had enough culture, Basel has an energetic concert and performance scene. Go to the Basel Tourismus Web site (www.baseltourismus.ch) for venues and schedules.    WHERE TO SHOP -- If you find yourself underdressed in this well-heeled city, head to Freie Strasse for all your Prada, Lanvin and Kiton emergencies. The fashion temple Trois Pommes has separate stores for men's (Freie Strasse 93; 41-61-272-9757) and women's (Freie Strasse 74; 41-61-272-9255).     For more offbeat, but equally fashionable wares, including antiques and jewelry, explore the area around Schneidergasse and Spalenberg. Impress the design-snob geeks back home with clever iPod cases made of felt (22 francs) and totes made from boat sails (89 francs) from Seven Sisters (Spalenberg 38; 41-61-262-0980; www.sevensisters.ch). Sharing the same space is Hand Made (Nadelberg 47; 41-61-261-3161; www.h-made.ch), a tightly edited trove of clothing and objects by Carpe Diem, Comme des Garçons and the French design duo Tsé & Tsé.      Like Art Basel, some of the best shopping here is fleeting. Through June 24, Comme des Garçons's latest ''guerrilla store'' is in the basement of Gare du Nord in the Badischer Bahnhof train station (Schwarzwaldallee 200; 41-61-261-3161; www.guerilla-store.com), showing conceptual pieces from current and previous collections. Likewise, Prada has its own pop-up store at St. Johanns-Vorstadt 38; open through June 19.    YOUR FIRST VISIT OR YOUR 10TH -- This capital of cutting-edge architecture has simply too many distinguished buildings to see in one trip: among them, buildings by Richard Meier, Mario Botta, Diener & Diener and, of course, Herzog & de Meuron. An architectural walking brochure is available at the Basel tourism office in the Stadtcasino at Barfüsserplatz (41-61-268-6868, www.baseltourismus.ch).    YES, FREE -- Within moments of arrival, all hotel guests are given their first taste of Basel hospitality: the Mobility Ticket, a free pass to the city's trams and buses. It's good for the length of your stay.    HOW TO GET THERE -- There are no direct flights to Basel from the United States.      From Kennedy Airport, American Airlines flies to Basel/Mulhouse Airport via London. A recent web search yielded round-trip fares in early June starting at $1,093. An often cheaper, and perhaps more convenient, way is to fly nonstop to Zurich. (Fares on Swiss International Air Lines from Kennedy Airport started at about $562.) From the Zurich airport, frequent trains arrive in central Basel in just over an hour, with a standard fare of 34 francs each way.    GETTING AROUND -- Basel is easy to navigate by foot, once you master the nuances of the street names. For example, Aeschengraben should not be confused with Aescherstrasse, Aeschenvorstadt and Aeschenplatz. Taxis run around 20 francs for trips within the city center. A better bet is the hop-on, hop-off tram system, Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (www.bvb-basel.ch), which is cheap, efficient and easy to use.

They were uninhabited when first discovered by the Portuguese in 1470 but by the mid-1500's became Africa's foremost exporter of sugar. As the sugar market declined, the islands became a major slave-trading center and producer of coffee and cocoa. By 1908 São Tomé was the world's largest cocoa producer. Portugal did not abolish slavery until 1876, and abusive labor practices continued until well into the 20th century. In 1953 hundreds of workers were killed in clashes with the Portuguese. Soon after, a small number of São Toméans formed the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (MLSTP) with its base in Gabon. But the islands did not gain independence until July 12, 1975. The MLSTP took over after independence and became the country's only official party. By 1986 the country relied on foreign aid for approximately 41 percent of its GNP. Although in the past it received military advisers from the former Soviet Union and economic advisers from Cuba, São Tomé and Príncipe has announced a foreign policy based upon nonalignment.

And while the history of luxury cruising is explored and the emergence of the Atlantic superliners recalled, there will be talk too, of the future - of the ships of the 21st century.   All this will be incorporated in a series of lectures given by Allan E. Jordan, historian of the American Merchant Marine Museum, a repository of marine artifacts, paintings, ship models and memorabilia on the grounds of the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y.   The setting for the lectures will be the Royal Viking Line's Royal Viking Sky, departing from New York on Aug. 24 and returning Sept. 6, and calling at Halifax, Quebec, Montreal, St. Pierre, Boston and Newport, R.I. Based on double occupancy, the prices range from $2,821 to $9,230, depending on choice of accommodations. Air fare from 50 designated North American cities to New York, the port of embarkation, is free.

Could you tell me what the best time of year is to do this and the names of places from which to charter? -S. E. M., New York Answer:According to experienced sailors, the strong currents, lack of safe anchorages and limited availability of boats in Hawaii make those islands unattractive for sailboat chartering. Much of the activity there is day sailing close to shore. In the South Pacific, sailing is popular the year round, but more rain is likely from December through March.   Among yacht charter agents with long experience in the South Pacific is Windward Leeward Yacht Charters (1212A Union Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94109","excerpt":"415-441-1334 or, outside the 415 area code, 800-922-4874). The company arranges both bareboat and crewed charters, particularly in Tahiti and the Kingdom of Tonga. Susan Karatsis, owner of the company, says Tahiti and Tonga offer more attractive sailing than Samoa, where few boats are available. She added that a 40-foot boat in Tahiti, with a skipper (but no cook) and all provisions, costs about $800 a person a week, based on a party of four. Q AND A"},{"year":"1986","title":"BIRD WATCHING OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA - Twenty-five miles to the west of the Golden Gate Bridge, in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean, lies a group of rocky outcroppings known as the Farallon Islands.   Here - at the largest sea bird rookery south of Alaska - are gathered more than a quarter of a million nesting birds: tufted puffins, petrels, murres, pelagic cormorants, rhinoceros auklets and black oyster catchers. Here, too, are to be found elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals, while the nearby waters are home to humpback and blue whales and porpoise.   Each Saturday and Sunday from now through October the Oceanic Society, a nonprofit organization devoted to conservation and education, offers trips to the Farallons aboard Coast Guard certified boats.   Each of the eight-hour expeditions leaving the San Francisco Yacht Harbor at the foot of Scott Street in San Francisco at 9 A.M. and returning at 5 P.M., is accompanied by two naturalists who provide information about the islands, their history and their wild inhabitants. The cruises are priced at $44 a person, not including any food or beverages.

Anti-Vietnam War activists drawn here during that decade of protests found more than politics. They discovered that Berkeley was a cosmopolitan place filled with museums and culture and blessed with a mild climate that made even winter enjoyable.

The 19-day trip is scheduled twice a year, in late October and again in late January. Land arrangements cost about $2,000 a person; air fare is extra.   Mountain Travel also offers similar expeditions by jeep in the same region of Algeria as well as in the Nubian desert of the Sudan and in the Arabian Peninsula of North Yemen.

Delta Line is phasing out the Santa Maria, the Santa Magdalena and the Santa Mariana. Each accommodating fewer than 100 passengers, the vessels - built in 1964 by the Grace Line for cargo and luxury travel - earned high repute on voyages that circumnavigated South America, passing through the Panama Canal in the north and around the Strait of Magellan in the south.     The 54-day voyages on these Grand Circle Cruises touched at ports from Manzanillo in Mexico and Balboa in the Canal Zone to Cartagena, Puerto Cabello, La Guaira, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Buenos Aires, Valparaiso, Callao, and Puerto Bolivar before returning to West Coast ports.    In the final series of cruises, departures are scheduled for July 26, Aug. 16, Sept. 6 and 17 and Oct. 18 from Los Angeles. The ships will also call at Vancouver, Tacoma and San Francisco. Though prices for the South American circumnavigations range from about $15,000 and up for the longest journey - beginning in Vancouver and returning there - the line offers less costly programs that include free flights to Rio and Buenos Aires that enable passengers to join the voyages for shorter spans.
