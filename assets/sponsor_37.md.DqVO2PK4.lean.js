The Japanese setting of the story gave Henry Otto, the director, and his associates exceptional opportunities, and they did not seem to have missed any of them. Also they made a number of pictures which revealed a mastery of camera technique as well as artistry of setting. Their dream and moonlight scenes were especially good. It was by its pictorial quality that \\"The Willow Tree\\" achieved distinction.With all its admitted accuracy of detail, and despite the fact that its cast included several natives of Japan, the photoplay was not impressively Japanese. Perhaps it wasn't meant to be. It was probably intended to be what it was, simply a romance employing an idea of Japan familiar in popular fiction, with costumes, settings and customs serving rather to give it fanciful colors than to identify it with the country across the Pacific.Viola Dane, who played the leading rôle, was a Japanese maiden of the kind seen sometimes in American musical comedies. Many persons, perhaps, would be pleased by her shrugs and smiles, her coy and cute ways of doing things, but none of her little tricks would be strange or foreign to them. It may be that they would like her better for that. A genuinely Japanese heroine might be somewhat incomprehensible.The story of \\"The Willow Tree\\" is from the play by J. H. Benrimo and Harrison Rhoades and is well known surely. Like most other Japanese romances contrived for Western consumption, it is about the love of an Englishman (sometimes he is an American) for a maiden of Japan, and the consequent, and expected, difficulties that arise. The narrative gets out of the rut, and becomes charming, when a supposed, and perhaps actual, Japanese legend is introduced in which the personified heart of a willow tree destroys her mortal life so that the warrior she loves may be free to answer his country's call to arms. The situation in the legend arises in the story, but the real heroine resorts to a ruse to send her English lover to the war against Germany and is waiting for him in perfect health when he returns four years later. She could not emulate the girl of the legend because that would have made the ending tragic, and \\"The Willow Tree\\" never has any idea of becoming a tragedy.Among those most noticeable in the cast, besides Miss Dana, are Edward Connelly, Pell Trenton, and Frank Tokunago.Beginning this week, the Capitol abandons its policy of continuing a musical production of the revue type through several weeks and turns to the presentation of operatic and other works to be changed every Sunday. The present offering is an elaborately staged cantata opera, \\"Hiawatha's Wedding Feast,\\" for which S. Coleridge-Taylor composed the music. Longfellow's words are sung by a chorus to orchestral accompaniment and the story is acted in pantomime by the principals. The result is novel and pleasing, except, perhaps, for those who have forgotten their \\"Hiawatha\\" and neglected to read the part of the poem printed in the program. The pantomime is hardly intelligible unless one knows beforehand what it is all about. Every one, however, can enjoy the excellent music and also the setting and general atmosphere of the production.\\"Double Speed,\\" with Wallace Reid, is at the Rivoli this week. Its title is misleading to those who have Reid's \\"The Roaring Road\\" and \\"The Lottery Man\\" in mind. Its speed is generally about half that of those productions, and sometimes much less. The story does become merry in places, though, and the general opinion will probably be that, if one has to wait for the laughs, they prove worth waiting for. This is principally because of Reid, but is also due to clever complications in the story, which is such an involved arrangement of nonsense that no satisfactory outline of it can be given in the space available. It must do to say that Reid takes the part of an adventurous young man who goes from New York to Los Angeles in an automobile, or rather two of them","excerpt":"changes his identity several times, fictitiously assumes his right name, and, after having all of his tangles straightened out, concentrates on making love to his heroine, who, by the way, is Wanda Hawley, as prepossessing and talented a young person as one is likely to meet on the screen for weeks.Tully Marshall and Theodore Roberts are in the cast, but haven't much to do, though, of course, they do that well. The production was directed by Sam Wood.Gaiety is added to the Rivoli program by a Chaplin-Essanay revival, \\"A Burlesque on Carmen,\\" in which Edna Purviance, the best leading woman Chaplin ever had, and Ben Turpin will be recognized.The photodramatic feature at the Strand this week is \\"Water, Water Everywhere,\\" with Will Rogers in the leading rôle, and other pictorial offerings are \\"Moosing Through Kipawa,\\" a Chester scenic, and \\"Call Loan,\\" an adaptation from O.

Welfare recipients remained very poor, the incentives the system gave them were horrible, and the lessons implicitly taught about responsibility and opportunity were destructive.    It seemed better, according to the consensus of opinion makers, to make a big push to shift people from welfare to work. The idea was to bolster the wages of low-skilled workers, to provide training programs so that long-term A.F.D.C. recipients could build enough skills to escape the system and to offer job-search assistance so that they could find employers who would pay for those skills. Such an extensive welfare overhaul would be more expensive for the government than would simple cash grants to nonworking single mothers, but to many liberals and conservatives it seemed worth the price.

The antimoose-hunting interests' defeat was substantial, about 60-40, but that the vote even took place, particularly in a state steeped in the hunting tradition, may be more significant than the outcome.   It was the first time in the nation that a big-game hunting season had been so challenged, and it seems certain that more such attempts - involving creatures other than moose, as well as hunting itself - will follow elsewhere.   The Maine referendum served notice that a distinct change in the national attitude toward hunting is taking place. What has apparently happened is that many citizens who do not hunt but who hitherto had no strong feelings about it are beginning to believe that it is an anachronistic, immoral, degrading and cruel activity.

Two public television series and a special are intended to send young readers to the stacks.    On the special, \\"Celebrate Storytelling\\" (Channel 13, Sunday, July 23 at noot), Kelly McGillis wanders into a book-filled room to introduce two Hans Christian Andersen stories. She tells \\"Thumbelina,\\" and Glenn Close narrates \\"The Emperor and the Nightingale.\\"    On \\"Storytime\\" (Channel 13, weekdays at 10:30 A.M., Channel 31 Monday through Thursday at 3:30 P.M.), which just began its second year on PBS, celebrites stop by a library set to read a story and chat with a puppet named Kino. On Monday, for example, John Goodman drops in to read \\"Little Polar Bear,\\" by Hans de Beer, and \\"Rose Meets Mr. Wintergarten,\\" by Bob Graham.    \\"Reading Rainbow\\" (Channel 13, weekdays at 4 P.M.","excerpt":"Channel 21, weekdays at 9:30 A.M.), which has been on the air since 1983, uses a book as a starting point for an adventure, activity or discussion, and offers children's mini-reviews of related books. On one show LeVar Burton, the host, follows a 17-year-old girl who has always wanted to be a pilot on her first flight, and Linda Lavin reads \\"Ruth Law Thrills a Nation,\\" by Don Brown. Mr. Burton plays with light, and Robert Guillaume reads Robert Louis Stevenson's poem \\"My Shadow.\\"    While Congress and parents cluck over the state of pop culture and its effects on children, programs like these continue to show that there are signs of intelligent life on television. Far from the din of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, beyond the known quantities of \\"Sesame Street\\" and \\"Barney,\\" the programs exist like small, calm islands, waiting for children and their parents to happen upon them.    The pace is slow, leaving room for imagination. The stories unfold as the camera lingers on illustrations. Some are minimally animated. Musical touches enhance the dramatic ebbs and flows. If a child can slow down long enough to be drawn in, the effect can be mesmerizing.    These programs are meant to jog parents to read to their children, and to prompt children to ask them to. Julie Cummins, the coordinator of children's services for the New York Public Library, said the New York City public schools have increased their push to keep pupils reading over the summer. Those who do, she said, \\"keep up their level of conprehension and don't have to catch up when they get back to school.\\"    The books that are read on the shows are a mix of the familiar and the new. The pattern between stories shows how books can start conversations. And on \\"Storytime,\\" seeing a grown-up curled up with a couple of kids on a couch is a reminder that children -- and parents -- need physical closeness to thrive and that reading together is one way to be close.    Is anybody tuning in? Recently 20,000 children ages 5 to 8 entered their own illustrated stories addressing the \\"I can do anything\\" theme of \\"Reading Rainbow.\\" Rabbit Ears, the producer of \\"Celebrate Storytelling,\\" modestly began a weekly radio show of children's stories read by actors like Robin Williams, Jeremy Irons, Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep last year that has been picked up by an impressive 271 public radio stations. (Locally it can be heard on WNYC-FM 93.9, at 7:30 A.M. on Sundays.) \\"Storytime\\" has added 10 new programs to its trove of episodes, and plans 10 or more for 1996. Ms. Cummins said that when it can, the library tries to make available the books on \\"Reading Rainbow.\\"    \\"Showing people reading, and valuing reading, passes along that value to children,\\" she said. \\"Anything that makes a connection between books and enjoyment is O.K. in our book.\\" When Television Is an Open Book"},{"year":"1963","title":"IT was last Aug. 10 that Harry Bachrach, the ticket  manager of the New York Giants, sold the last seats for the team's home opener at Yankee Stadium this Sunday against the Cleveland Browns.

Since the 1960's, the oily fish, used in fertilizer and cat food, has been harvested with power winches, but the songs that rallied the fishermen's strength have survived. They were the rarest music in Tuesday's concert, a Folk Masters program that also included Delta blues from Mississippi and Mardi Gras Indian songs from New Orleans.   As the program's host and folklorist, Nick Spitzer, pointed out, the chanteys sound like kin to the South African miners' songs of groups like Ladysmith Black Mambazo. They are call-and-response songs, paced like slow-rolling sea swells. A single voice or two in harmony sing a line that is answered by the full chorus in warm major chords, with lyrics about the work, the weather, harsh captains and women back on shore.

Such an America could produce only the conservative Revolution described by historians of a generation ago, a Revolution meant not to bring change but to preserve an established good life from the threat of change.   Such golden ages have a way of disappearing under close scrutiny. The 18th-century America that is emerging slowly from recent studies was a more divided and troubled place than tradition and most textbooks suggest.

Her midwestern roots were evident in her sense of fairness and ethics. Born and raised in Duluth, MN she graduated from Smith College in 1924 (was the only one to return and participate in her 75th reunion). Attended the Sorbonne, received a law degree from New York University in the late 1920's. She was a pro bono lawyer for 20 years at the Juvenile Court in the Bronx. A seasoned traveller before World War II. She could read Greek, Latin and French; studied Russian language and Russian literature at Hunter College until she was 96. Attended art classes at the Metropolitan Museum and went to the Philharmonic until late last fall. Married to Arthur M. Berger for over 53 years. He predeceased her, as did a brother Irving and son-in-law Daniel Cowin. Survived by daughter Joyce Cowin, three grandchildren Kenneth (Jasmin), Andrew (Allyson), Dana (Barclay Palmer), three great-grandchildren Reagan and Alexandra Cowin, Sylvie Palmer. As well as a sister Muriel Cowan and brother Arthur Josephs (Adrianne) from Duluth, MN. Interment private. A celebration of her life will be held at her daughter's, April 3rd, 4-8 PM.

The Board of Trustees and Professional Staff of the American Folk Art Museum record with sorrow the death of their friend Sylvia Josephs Berger, mother of Joyce Cowin, a dedicated member of the Museum's Board. A person of grace and quiet dignity, Sylvia Berger enjoyed a long lifetime distinguished by its adventurous pursuits, commitment to learning and often anonymous deeds of kindness. She joined her daughter, Joyce, and late son-in-law, Daniel Cowin, in rallying to the cause of the American Folk Art Museum, doing so with her customary generosity and enthusiasm to help the Museum realize its dream of a new institutional home. Living into her 100th year, Sylvia Berger embraced life to its fullest. To Joyce and her family we convey our deepest sympathy and heartfelt condolences. Ralph Esmerian, Chairman L.
