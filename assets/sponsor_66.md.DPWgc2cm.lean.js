If the tactic succeeds, victory may be swift and allied casualties minimal. If it fails, battlefield confusion could greatly complicate fighting and prolong the war.    AirLand warfare -- a tactical doctrine the Army eccentrically persists in spelling as one word -- was developed in the 1970's as a defense against a hypothetical Soviet invasion of Western Europe, in which Soviet armored forces would greatly outnumber those of the defenders. In essence, a force using the tactic would concentrate its heaviest fire on the enemy's rear lines, long-range artillery, reserves and supply routes, crippling reserve tanks and armored vehicles before they could be brought to the front. Political Factors Involved     The object is to so weaken the underpinnings of a large army that its cutting edge can be shattered relatively painlessly. In an assault against the large and well-equipped Iraqi force in Kuwait, believed to number about 400,000, this could be achieved by planes, helicopters, battlefield missiles and large shells, like those fired from the Persian Gulf by the 16-inch guns of the battleships Missouri and Wisconsin.

The Hawks have accused Mitchell of breaching his $4.5 million contract, but Sroba said the Hawks have breached it by their actions.

The council has met eight times, most recently last Wednesday. ''We've made a number of recommendations to the President, each of which he has followed, I think without exception,'' Mr. Baker said.  It was the new council that worked out the Administration's successful salvo in the ''pasta war'' with the European Economic Community - the threat to  raise duties on European pasta if Europe did not begin removing its barriers against imports of American citrus fruit.

His familiar stance, while not entirely wrong, is exaggerated and misleading because it ignores that there is another and brighter side to the strong dollar and the trade deficit, besides the dreary one that preoccupies him.   For example, the U.S. trade deficit is and has been a significant transmitter of the American economic recovery to our European allies - which is, of course, an important national interest to the United States and, incidentally, has been not a negligible factor behind NATO's recent decision to increase expenditures for military infrastructure and related improvements in conventional defense capabilities.  The strong dollar and our large import surplus have also made major contributions to the improvements that have occurred in the economic prospects of Mexico and Brazil. Indeed, for these countries and other major international debtors to have any reasonable chance of servicing their large dollar debts, it is essential that the U.S. should incur substantial trade deficits.  It hardly needs saying that the strong dollar also benefits American consumers and producers by both damping inflationary pressures in the U.S. and by the increased access it provides for a wider choice of imported consumer and producer goods at favorable dollar prices.  Mr. Bergsten's hand wringing over the acquisition by foreigners of dollar assets ironically reveals the nationalist and even latent isolationist sentiments harbored by some folk who, like him, prefer to think of themselves as avid internationalists.","excerpt":"U.S. ECONOMY IS A RELATIVE PILLAR OF STRENGTH"},{"year":"1965","title":"There was no sign last week that the nation's economy was losing any of its steam.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 - President Reagan ordered the use of American air and naval forces against anti-Government positions near Beirut today as a show of support for President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon and as a warning to Syria and its Lebanese supporters, Administration officials said.   The officials said the air strike - only the second time United States aircraft carrier-based planes had carried out raids in Lebanon - and the naval bombardment were ordered to protect Americans, after the marines and the United States Embassy were shelled on Sunday as part of the stepped-up effort by Syrian-backed Druse and Shiite forces to undercut the Gemayel Government.   One White House official said the American military moves were taken to put some ''bite'' into the Administration's latest words in support of Mr. Gemayel, who is seeking to form a new, more broadly-based government after his Cabinet resigned on Sunday as a result of Syrian and opposition pressure.

They add that if the young Lebanese leader is to survive the challenge with his job and his country's unity intact, there will have to be sweeping changes in the way he has been governing the country and dealing with its Moslem majority.   Mr. Gemayel's attempt on Sunday night to appease his opponents was, in the words of one Greek Orthodox former Defense Minister now in the opposition, ''way too little and way too late.''

At the same time, it is beginning to wonder whether Mr. Gemayal can continue in power.  President Reagan has fallen back on the increased use of American military power as the only way to hold the situation together, having decided that Syria has ignored American warnings against stepping up the fighting.    More force and more one-sided commitment are not what Mr. Reagan wants. But officials say they are coming to feel that these factors are inherent in the circumstances.
