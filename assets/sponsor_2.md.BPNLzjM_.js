What do you think is wrong?  Strict Limits Are Needed   Senator Bradley is correct when he says that the political system is broken. It is broken because Government has gone far beyond its legitimate powers as enumerated in the Constitution. Government has been indifferent to the costs of its policies and oblivious to the diminishing of personal liberties. A strictly limited Government is the only fix that will work. JIM TOSONE Washington Township A Killer Sport   Politics has become a killer sport, with corporate interests owning players, media touts setting the odds, backroom wheelers and dealers divvying up the gate and extremists from both sides screaming for blood. If anyone can restore humanity to politics and bring clear, deliberative thinking to government, Bill Bradley will be the one to do it. LOIS B. REDISCH Englewood Ready for 3d-Party Vote   The Democratic Party is what's broken. Bill Bradley wants to run for President, and lots of us want to vote for him. Americans are not worried about voting for a third-party candidate. Perot might have won if he weren't so quirky. Any other conservative Republicans for Bradley out there? JOHN VAN HEUSDEN Osprey, Fla. An Incredible Position   It's absolutely incredible that a liberal like Bill Bradley, who voted for 17 years for every partisan Democratic movement and against the Balanced Budget Amendment, has the nerve to suddenly say that both parties are broken and that he just might be the independent we need to be President. HARRY HURLEY Ventnor Too Much to Endure    I agree the system is broken.  There are several reasons. First, the expense of campaigning leads to compromises for fund-raising that foster corruption and the abandonment of principle. Second, candidates and officeholders, as well as their families, have been subjected to vicious smear campaigns.The number of people willing to endure this is a rapidly shrinking pool. JUDI OWENS Brick The Citizens' Fault    Is politics broken? You bet it is, and for the same reason a house falls apart or a car breaks down. The owners are to blame, and that means the average American citizen. My question is not why Bill Bradley is calling it quits, but why he took so long to throw in the towel, as many other thoughtful, frustrated politicians have.

Sight and Sound   At Imagine Tomorrow, children in groups of eight work on projects that integrate all of the elements of multimedia. They can construct videos with special effects, design computer games with themselves as characters, and watch their ideas come to life as they produce interactive stories. The projects require planning, logic and critical thinking skills. Children schedule their time, outline their ideas, write their script, and plot their games. In addition, they learn how to find information on on-line services and multimedia encyclopedias. The kids are learning and having fun. There are centers inPark Ridge, Madison and Bernardsville, and two more will open this summer, in Denville and Middletown. KATHERINE PATTERSON Morristown The author is vice president of Imagine Tomorrow. Musicals All Summer   Gloucester Township center for the arts presents these children's musicals at 10:30 A.M.: July 11-14, Jungle Book. July 18-21, The Wizard of Oz. July 25-28, Pinocchio. July 26, Gary Rosen (Tot Rock) of Rosenshontz. Aug. 1-4, Kids on Broadway.    Call 609-227-3091 for information or tickets. ED FISCELLA Blackwood Last month, Chatter asked for opinions about the way the news media covers New Jersey. Look to the Shore   We have wonderful restaurants and entertainment down here. There is an abundance of well-received live theater (especially the Henderson Theater in Lincroft, which is currently featuring a new original play by the writing team of Milmore and VanZandt, who have many situation comedy credits to their name, as well as some off-Broadway New York productions) and an active alternative and jazz music scene.   The northern shore communities are anything but summer tourist attractions, and it would be nice to see more reporting on us down here. Also, there is hard news going on in urban areas like Long Branch and Asbury Park, where attempting to rebuild is a daily struggle. LEE-ANN NIBBLING Long Branch Covering the Arts   You solicited opinions about the way the news media cover the state. In my view, superbly well except perhaps for the performing arts. There is an explosion of dance events and plans by indigenous regional and touring companies which deserve to be chronicled. Last year I discovered the formation of a performance center and school in upstate New York, at which four New Jersey companies are committed, among others, to presenting seminars, classes and performances. The story has been under-reported everywhere. JOSEPH GALE Millburn How to Talk Back    Each week, this column summarizes responses to one question and poses another.

Next: Supporters of Governor Whitman's plan to cut the state income tax by another 15 percent say it will distribute the tax burden more fairly and stimulate the economy. Opponents say her timing is unwise, given the possibility of large cuts in Federal aid or a recession, and they claim it will lead to higher property taxes. What do you think?
