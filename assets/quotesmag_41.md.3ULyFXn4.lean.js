So Israelis now keep especially close watch on the U.S. elections even as their own June 23 day of reckoning approaches. Bill Clinton will be pleased, sort of, with the Israeli preference. But President Bush can console himself, sort of, with the fact that deteriorating Israeli-American ties have not become a campaign issue in the Holy Land.

Mr. dos Santos had held, and won, free and fair multiparty elections last September. Mr. dos Santos's antagonist, Jonas Savimbi, head of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, having petulantly denounced the balloting, then renewed his guerrilla war. And while Mr. dos Santos accepted a United States-brokered peace plan early this month, Mr. Savimbi has not. Angola has over the years retained close trading ties with the United States, despite aid provided to Mr. Savimbi by the Bush and Reagan Administrations.

The producers are William Miles, who has focused much of his documentary-film career on the subject of blacks in the military (\\"Men of Bronze,\\" \\"A Different Drummer\\"), and Nina Rosenblum, a film and television producer, director and writer, whose father documented the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau as an Army Signal Corps cameraman. As might be expected, the archival material in \\"Liberators\\" is riveting.

The old Herreshoff Manufacturing Company, now extinct, built eight in a row, starting with Vigilant in 1893. Its modern counterpart, Eric Goetz Custom Boats, built the 1992 winner here, and all three of the U.S. boats that competed to defend the cup this year -- Stars & Stripes, Young America and Mighty Mary.    There is a century of difference between Capt. Nat Herreshoff's huge gaff-rigged sloops that stretched as much as 150 feet overall, and the sleeker, slimmer designs, half as long, of today. But there is one striking similarity. Boats that raced in the 1890's represented the cutting edge of marine technology at the time, just as the boats in the races that start Saturday off San Diego represent today's most advanced. Dennis Connor's crew won the trials in Stars & Stripes, but will defend the cup in Young America, which seems faster. Such is the margin of perfection in modern boat-building.
