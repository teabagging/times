There, she is haunted by reminders of the mysterious Irma Vep, Lord Edgar's first wife. With two actors taking on eight roles between them, the show is solidly built on a lightning-fast series of costume changes and on gags that pile allusion upon allusion but never collapse under their  silly weight.

In this colorful, whimsical show of 145 original Jean and Laurent de Brunhoff watercolors and sketches, families can see Babar on skis, in an air balloon, being wed, crying when he remembers his mother, and in a lifeboat. Celeste, Babar's wife, and their three children, Pom, Flora and Alexander, are frolicking in many of the illustrations, too, in settings so detailed, vivid and natural that the Babar clan seems far more lifelike in these three galleries than it does on the pages of the reproduced books. As one caption from a Babar book says, \\"They look like elephants, but yet they were not elephants.\\" The show is split between the academy's third and fourth floors (the funnier paintings are on the fourth floor), and the artworks are hung at the eye level of an older child, so younger children will have to be lifted up to see, for example, \\"The Camp of the Elephants,\\" a scene where bull's-eyes are being painted on elephants' backsides. Many of the paintings bear the original French captions, so those schooled in that language can try out their skills. The academy has painted the woodwork in bright Babar colors and the bookstore sells Babar books and T-shirts ($11.95 for children, $14.95 for adults) that were designed for the show by Laurent de Brunhoff. The academy also has a free Babar arts-and-crafts drop-in workshop from 1 to 3 P.M. on the weekends. The galleries are open Tuesdays from noon to 8 P.M., Wednesdays through Sundays from noon to 5 P.M. Admission: $3.50 for adults and $2 for children. (Free on Tuesdays from 5 to 8 P.M.) 'Bronze Casting'  Metropolitan Museum of Art  (212) 879-5500  Recommended ages: 7 and up  Through Nov. 3    Have you ever wondered how a bronze sculpture is created from start to finish? This current exhibition, \\"Bronze Casting,\\" coincides with another show, \\"The Art of Paul Manship\\"","excerpt":"both explore sculpture casting techniques. Sculptors who use this form spend most of their time on such labor-intensive tasks as chasing (filing and grinding) the metal. In this clear show, cross-sectional, adult's eye-level displays of the many stages of creating a bronze sculpture examine the lost-wax, French-sand and ceramic-shell casting methods. Viewers will discover that casting is itself an art; many sculptors rely on foundries to handle this complex, technical work. The final stage of a bronze sculpture is the application of color, using a patina. Children also can admire an assortment of serious-looking foundry tools. A short video adds another visual aid to understanding the various techniques. The show is in the Henry R. Luce Center for the Study of American Art, at the mezzanine level below the American Wing. Afterward, families can look at Paul Manship's bronze \\"Group of Bears\\" in the Charles Engelhard Court. The Met is open Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays from 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. and on Fridays and Saturdays from 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M. Suggested admission for adults, $6; students, $3; children under 12, free. Art Workshop: 'Puerto Rican Discovery and Heritage'  Museum of the City of New York  Fifth Avenue at 103d Street  (212) 534-1672  Recommended ages: 8 to 12  Tomorrow    The painter Armando Soto is an old hand at \\"helping children tell a story on paper.\\" He has worked extensively with New York City children on murals; for tomorrow's art workshop, he will have children use themes from their neighborhoods to create a collage mural. \\"They can use the tools -- like musical instruments -- that are in the neighborhood,\\" Mr. Soto explained. As an example, the artist cited the tambourine, an instrument one finds frequently in East Harlem. Children will draw such images with crayons and Magic Markers on paper, cut them out and paste them up on the mural paper. Mr. Soto will also take children and accompanying adults on a tour of \\"A New Season: Art From Taller Boricua,\\" an exhibition in the museum in which Mr. Soto has a still-life drawing. Taller Boricua is a longstanding arts group that organizes art classes for young East Harlem residents. For the 2 P.M. workshop tomorrow, art supplies will be provided at no charge. The workshop is free for members and $3 for nonmembers (includes museum admission) and lasts about 90 minutes. Suggested museum admission is $4 for adults and $2 for children. The No. 6 subway train stops at 103d Street, three blocks east of the museum. 'Con To' Los Hierros: A Retrospective of the Work of Pepon Osorio'  El Museo del Barrio  104th Street, at Fifth Avenue  (212) 831-7272  Recommended ages: 2 and up  Through Dec. 1    Upon opening the exhibition's aqua screen door, visitors to this cheerful and open museum will be struck by Pepon Osorio's tropically colored and lavishly decorated artwork. What children might notice after that is the elaborately festooned chandelier in the first gallery. Draped in beads and enlivened with miniature plastic palm trees, baby dolls, spiders, squirt guns, among other eclectic items, the chandelier seems to dance more than just hang. Children should take great delight in pointing out the dozens of tchotchkes. They probably will also notice the mauve velvet couch hanging on the wall. This work, entitled \\"A Mis Adorables Hijas\\" (1990), has a solemn message (as do some of the other works) scrolled, in gold lettering, across the cushions. (The message, in Spanish, refers to a mother bidding farewell to her daughters.) \\"La Bicicleta,\\" 1985, is fantasy with a purpose: when the artist was a youngster, he liked to put cards and half-blown-up balloons on his bike so it would sound like a motorcycle. This bicycle has Mass cards glued to its pedals, orange and purple tires, and chrome covered in plastic cupids and palm trees. The piece de resistance is \\"La Cama,\\" 1987, a bed that, as the placard says, \\"breaks the boundaries of good taste.\\" But who can resist it? With a bedspread covered with ribbons, the bed suggests dreams of angels and heaven. The one-floor museum has no eating area but is conducive to strollers. It is open Wednesdays through Sundays from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Suggested admission is $2 for adults and free for children under 12 when accompanied by an adult. 'Columbus'  Theaterworks/USA  Promenade Theater  2162 Broadway, at 76th Street  (212) 677-5959  Recommended ages: 8 to 12  Through Oct. 26    Theaterworks/USA begins its eighth season with the story of Columbus's forays into the New World. This musical -- with songs that show off the male cast's voices -- travels back to Columbus as a teen-age upstart in Genoa, where he is eager to become a mariner, and then onward to Lisbon, where he owns a map shop and is even more eager to sail west, thereby opening a new route to the Orient. He is then depicted in Spain, where his pleas for money from Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand are met with rebuffs for about six years. Finally, the Queen finances the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria, and Columbus, dressed in blue crushed velvet, departss. The play's tension and pace reach their peak during the voyage, when Columbus and his wary crew are hungry for the sight of land. Once they come upon a flat, green island (which he names San Salvador), the tension unravels. Columbus returns to Spain and subsequently sails to the New World several more times, but never finds the East. The 75-minute play has no intermission and it follows closely the explorer's decline. Columbus, played energetically by Michael Bartoli, is portrayed as slightly foolish at times. Some younger children grow restless toward the play's end, but overall \\"Columbus\\" is educational, historically current and introduces Bartholomew, Columbus's naysayer brother. Performances are tomorrow and Sunday (and Oct. 26) at 12:30 P.M. Tickets are $15 and $13. KEEP IN MIND    \\"JOYOUS DRAGON SHADOW THEATER,\\" where children can watch a shadow-theater performance and then learn to make their own shadow figures (for children 8 and over only).

Most of his albums are solo recordings, with Jandek unsteadily strumming a barely tuned guitar and singing -- or mumbling, or declaiming, or sighing, or occasionally shouting -- songs that evade melodies while the lyrics contemplate desolation and estrangement. A female singer or a drummer sometimes joins him.    Jandek did not perform in public, it is believed, until 2004, when he appeared at a festival in Glasgow. Now he is playing a handful of American dates, including this New York concert. 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212)505-5181.

Modern country allows for individualism, but only in tandem with an overriding respect for tradition.

Squeeze, however, wants to push things further.    Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, Squeeze's songwriters, have a puzzle-maker's approach to pop. On the surface, the band follows the Beatles model; Mr. Tilbrook sings like a lighter-voiced Paul McCartney in tunes that chug along like 1960's pop-rock, with occasional excursions into rockabilly or quasi-country. Their unannounced project is to write songs that make unlikely chords and tunes cohere, with lyrics that intelligently anatomize romance, while sidestepping ordinary structures (like a song with verses and a bridge but no chorus), but that sound catchy anyway. Sometimes they go so far that the songs lose their pop veneer and start to ramble, but after 17 years as a band, Squeeze has learned when to hold back. And when it does indulge itself, it can always fall back on its hits.

I don't believe I've ever heard even the most ardent Aaron fan ever say Hank Aaron was better than Babe Ruth, but let's give Hank some credit:   *He hit 313 homers from age 33 on (Ruth hit 298). Only 56 players in the history of baseball hit more during their entire careers!   *While he did play nine years in Atlanta, the 335 homers he hit there areonly three more than the 332 he hit during his last nine years in Milwaukee. Ruth played in the Polo Grounds where in two and two-thirds seasons he hit 148 homers, and 12 years in Yankee Stadium","excerpt":"both made for left-handed pull hitters.   *Aaron played night games, day games after night games (Ruth would have loved that), traveled far more than Ruth, faced hard-throwing relief specialists, the slider, etc.   *Between 1955 and 1973, Aaron hit over 30 homers 15 times, never hitting fewer than 24. He drove in 90 or more runs 16 times, never fewer than 77. He hit over .300 14 times, never less than .265. A guy who hits 24 homers, drives in 77 runs and hits .265 is worth $2-$3 million today.   A career is a career, no matter how many at bats it includes. Hank Aaron had a great one and it's about time people started comparing it to his contemporaries and not to the ghost of Babe Ruth.

With prescience (considering the brouhaha about exit-polling that burst forth over a century later) he added: ''It is the greatest of cowards, for it is afraid of itself.''   If Hazlitt had been writing today, he would have used one adjective that now does the work of those eight:    mean-spirited   . The rise of this word - paralleling either an increase of mean-spiritedness or an escalation of the attack on mean-spiritedness - is a perfect example of the way an old and occasionally- used term, straggling along behind the march of language, can be rejuvenated and rushed to the vanguard when the moment arrives for its special meaning. Only a word can fill a void.   This parasynthetic compound had a religious upbringing: ''Away with that mean-spirited religion,'' adjured Francis Bragge in 1694, discoursing on the parables. Five years later, Matthew Henry used the word in his ''Meekness of Spirit'': ''Meekness is commonly despised as a piece of cowardice and mean-spiritedness.''

SONTAG & KAEL: Opposites Attract Me, by Craig Seligman. (Counterpoint, $23.) An eager, confiding book, by an experienced writer and editor, about two widely discussed and influential critical icons who arose at the same historical moment (mid-1960's). They come to represent a quarrel, never explicit, between attitudes that Kael might call solemnity and that Sontag might call frivolity.    BIRTH OF THE CHESS QUEEN: A History, by Marilyn Yalom. (HarperCollins, $24.95.) A wide-ranging exploration of the origins of chess and of its most powerful piece, the queen. Chess was once queenless, and Yalom attributes the queen's arrival and empowerment to the rising status of women in medieval Europe.    INSIDE THE VICTORIAN HOME: A Portrait of Domestic Life in Victorian England, by Judith Flanders. (Norton, $34.95.) A nimble piece of social history that draws from archives, novels, advice manuals and newspapers to show home becoming what it still ideally is: a refuge from the Industrial Revolution and an expression of morality sequestered from the harsh world.    PORT MUNGO, by Patrick McGrath. (Knopf, $24.) This immensely clever, tautly composed novel concerns a Gauguinistic artist who flees the suffocating confines of London for New York, then Havana, then Port Mungo, at the end of world and mind, where his genius flourishes.
