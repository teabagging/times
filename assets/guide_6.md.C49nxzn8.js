Max Morath, sometimes as a singer but more prominently as ragtime pianist, has been similarly subversive at the keyboard. The three came together on Sunday afternoon in the Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College. Benefiting was the Institute for Studies in American Music at Brooklyn College. Cited was H. Wiley Hitchcock, its founding director, who is retiring. And noted, too, was the Bolcom and Morris anniversary: The team's first concert, in 1973, was under the auspices of the institute.   Musical values have been so influenced by ideas and progress -- in other words, by the politics of style -- that the American popular song is by and large the recipient of affectionate pats and subsequent dismissal from serious scrutiny. Its harmonic language has not kept pace with the Schoenbergs of 20th-century music and, at its most sophisticated, goes very little past turn-of-the-century Ravel. The June-moon-croon school of lyrics sounds somehow more legitimate in Schumann's German than in 1920's Americanese.
