Besides running a research center with 1,000 employees, giving lectures and advising students, he campaigns for medical aid to poor countries, helps the secretary general of the United Nations with economic development strategies and advises heads of state and government on financial policies.

Davis took a pass from a double-teamed John Starks, went up from the top of the circle, one foot on the 3-point line. He was wide open, so Scottie Pippen came a calling from inside the lane. Pippen, with two of the longest arms in pro basketball, leaped out at Davis, tried to alter the shot. He did that, too, but he got a piece of Davis's hand, no question, on the way down and an official named Hue Hollins didn't let him get away with it.

Born in Moscow in 1918, she lived in Berlin and Paris before immigrating to New York in 1938. Following her father's deportation to Auschwitz, she was the driving force in bringing her mother and sister to the United States in 1947. She loved all things beautiful: nature, art, theater, music and dance. Once a professional dancer, she received an MFA from Queens College. She translated the fluid beauty of the body into insights about character, creating a vision called Imageology. Knowing how important self-image can be, especially for those struggling with cancer, she pushed tirelessly for increased use of creative and alternative therapies, especially dance, music and art therapies, to enhance the quality of patients' lives, even as she herself was battling debilitating illness. She was well ahead of her time in recognizing the value of these creative therapies in helping patients. Surviving her are her beloved sister Vera Stern, her six nephews and nieces by birth and marriage, her five great-nephews and great-nieces, and her many friends and students. Both she and her family are grateful to Patricia and Precilla, and all the doctors, nurses and staff on the 12th floor of Memorial Hospital.
