Without wasting too much regret over this speed-up system which necessarily breeds a certain careless, assembly line attitude in the idea department, we may venture to predict that in the current chapter the Hardys will enchant the family-picture trade as usual. Mickey Rooney in the throes of puppy love and a class play simultaneously will almost inevitably prove too comical for this special audience to resist.Serious-minded Hardy fans, on the other hand, who value integrity of character more highly than variety of incident, may well protest against the psychological violation of old Judge Hardy, which takes place incidentally in the present volume for no better object than to lend poignance to the romancings of Master Rooney. It was only last April, in \\"The Hardys Ride High,\\" that the old judge figured as a shrewd, unmaterialist philosopher, above such pretty hurts as the loss of a $2,000,000 inheritance. Now, though we can see plainly that he is still Lewis Stone, we must accept him as a person sufficiently greedy and credulous to fall for a confidence scheme which the average boardwalk sucker would see through. Of course, he gets out handily in the end, but the principle's the same.For the benefit of guests just new entering the Hardy family circle, if such there be, we must explain that Master Rooney is always the whole show in these affairs. This time he becomes emotionally involved with a pretty teacher of dramatics, exhibits a rather disquieting precocity, in fact, and it is only the combined sympathy of the pretty teacher and (he wisdom of the judge which steers him back to his steady girl friend, the relentlessly ungrown-up Miss Ann Rutherford. Incidentally, it may be remarked in passing that the directoral technique of W. S. Van Dyke 2d is growing more and more to resemble the factory methods of Mr. Charles Bedaux.

Two new German films that are far above the average, deserve to be placed in that very still small number that give the film the right to be taken seriously as an entertainment for mental grown-ups. If you like your films flavored with thought, then Germany is the place to supply your demand. I know the nabobs of Hollywood think the German producers are often crazy idealists but the Teutons seem to make money at it—so perhaps even crazy idealism sometimes pays.The first picture for which I am hanging out banners is \\"Mädchen in Uniform\\" (Girls in Uniform), which had its premiere at the Capitol. It is a \\"studio\\" film. This designation usually means that an optimistic young man who believes that he is a director has collected a lot of optimistic young people who believe that they are actors and, putting an old camera under his arm, has gone out into the great outdoors and made something he called a film drama. You have to be a relative to enjoy the result. But this time, although somewhat the same methods were used, it was all done under the supervision of Carl Froelich, one of Germany's very finest directors. This film has all the technical finish of the usual \\"commercial\\" productions and something of the freshness and idealism which are often the only commendable feature of \\"studio\\" productions.The scenario of \\"Mädchen in Uniform\\" was founded on the stage play \\"Gestern und Heute\\" by Christa Winslow. This was a sincere, often subtly characterized little drama, but I did not see any particular reason for setting it over onto the screen. It seemed too concentrated scenically and was lacking in dramatic impulse. Well, I am happy to be able to report that I was wrong. It made one of the most moving and original scripts of the season.Indeed it was one of those exceptional cases where the screen adaptation was better than the stage play. The whole action is laid in a Potsdam boarding-school for girls of aristocratic families. And the film could give us the life of the \\"young ladies\\" with far greater fullness—we saw the whole school, not just a room or two. Moreover, on the stage the play dwindled off toward the end, its last act was its weakest. But the screen adaptation added tension to it and by skillful cutting built it up to a powerful dramatic finish.Seldom has mood been caught on the screen as here the chill frigidity of this Potsdam \\"institute of education.\\" Seldom has so large a number of rôles been played with such complete self-effacement, such an unswerving desire to serve the story alone. There is Hertha Thiele as Manuela, an orphan, who finds in the human warmth of the teacher, Fräulein von Bernburg, played by Dorothea Wieck, the mother love she missed at home. But this girlish, slightly hysterical adulation is misinterpreted by the head m'stress, a masterpiece of Prussian severity in the characterization of Emilia Unda. Manuela is severely disciplined, forbidden to ever speak to the teacher again. She is only barely saved from suicide and the picture closes on the old head mistress stumping away with her cane down a long corridor, a distant bugle call underlining the passing of an ideal—the fanatic Prussian creed of duty.The second film, \\"Kameradschaft\\" (Comradeship), directed by G. W. Pabst, aimed higher and, as is so often the case, came less nearer the bullseye of perfection. It swept out to take combat with some of the most vital social problems of our time—you can hardly expect that it would be completely successful. But it was a heroic attempt, as stirring as all vigorous crusading. It is nothing for the squeamish, those whose nerves lie close to the surface. But if you are strong enough to stand a hearty slab of truth, if you want to face the reality of our time, this is a film you will not want to miss. Its dialogue, half French, half German, is of a subordinate character and it is quite possible to follow the story without understanding either language.The film is not built around individual human beings but about coal mines and the spirit of solidarity which unites the miners of all nations. The terrible mine disaster at Courbiére near the French-German border gave the basis for the scenario. Then German workers crossed the border to bring help to their French comrades who were trapped in the shafts. The adaptors have added an effective touch which I understand is not based on fact. The French and German mines on the border meet underground and are only separated by an iron gate over which is the sign \\"Frontière 1919.\\" Some German miners break through this when they set out on their rescue work and the film closes with the gate being set up again, French and German officials stamping protocols recording this re-erection of the border. A proof of the film's success was that the audience received this scene with protests and jeers.Yes, whatever its faults may be, the picture certainly accomplished its main object. Its magnificently conceived and executed picturization of a mine disaster caused by gas explosions makes us realize the horrible dangers to which coal miners are continually exposed, makes us understand that tie of common fear which binds them together. And the film is all the more suited to do pioneering work in its field, as it is without the crude communistic edges which make the Soviet pictures ineffectivefor us. \\"Kameradschaft\\" is one of the few pictures that make us aware that there are other problems than whom Susie is going to marry or why Reggie put poison in the tea. And, if only for the sake of variety, it is a good scheme to occasionally take your entertainment without sugar.THE German film industry is beginning to get excited and run around waving its arms. The cyclone is due day after tomorrow, they shriek. In an industry which sells drama even the salesmen have a tendency to be dramatic—really it isn't as bad as all that. But still there is a good deal to worry them. In the first place, things had been going almost too well. The arrival of the talkie gave the German producers their big chance, for it practically wiped out the American, their strongest competitor, from the German market.But now, owing to the general depression and the fact that talking pictures are no longer a novelty, the receipts are falling in the film theatres. And the possibilities for exporting German films are also getting smaller and smaller. Lettland is cutting down the number of foreign films, Yugoslavia is on the verge of bankruptcy and Hungary is almost completely busted. Czechoslovakia has just passed severe new rulings about the importation of foreign films. Scandinavia has dived into a new depression. Austria, which was always considered a part of Germany, has issued a new import permit regulation which cuts down the profits to be gotten out of that counry. And, on top of all this, the new strict German and foreign currency regulations often make it impossible for the Germans to get hold of the money which their pictures have earned outside of the Reich.So the Spio, the organization which combines all branches of the film, including producers, distributers and theatre owners, has passed a lot of revolutionary resolutions which seek to cut down expenses all along the line. The stars' salaries are to be reduced to a normal figure (a very elastic phrase). The other actors are to get a cut of at least 20 per cent. No actors are to be engaged through agents or managers, thus eliminating a commission. The technical staff, although this was seldom overpaid, is either to have its salaries docked or be reduced in number. In order to see that these cuts are really carried out, a central office is to be established, at which the salaries of all actors, camera men, &c., are registered, and from which any firm can find out their lowest figure.Further, the Spio is continuing its offensive by trying to get reduction in the license charges asked by the Tobis (the German sound patent holders), in the price of film stock, in the charges asked for the developing of films and in the rents of the studios. Up to now, the only result has been the reduction of the charges for the developing and printing of films from 21 pfennigs to 15 pfennigs a meter. There was a mighty to-do about the opening of negotiations with Tobis and then came a great silence. Tobis have a monopolistic position, as they own all the sound patents, and it is difficult to budge them. They have a lot of smooth business men in their organization, but perhaps they are just a little too clever—after all, the important thing for Tobis is that they have a healthy group of producers on whom they can depend and who will pay their bills promptly. A lot of bad debts, no matter how imposing they may look on paper, never brings cheer to the stockholders. But this Winter will see several producing firms in the bankruptcy court, so Tobis may decide to loosen up a bit.A striking demonstration of the theory that seeing motion pictures may be classified as a necessity as well as a diversion is found in a recent decision by the leading film houses of Berlin to place 60,000 free tickets per month at the disposition of the municipal welfare bureau during the Winter season. As reported in Vorwaerts, the authorities will check up on all applicants for free tickets so that there will be no abuse of the charity.According to a report from Moscow in the Frankfurter Zeitung of Nov. 12, the Soviet Government has reduced the annual subsidy of the film industry from 7,700,000 rubles (nominally worth 51 cents each) to 3,000,000, because of the difficult economic situation. It is said that only five big feature films are to be produced in the State studios in 1932, instead of eight, as originally scheduled.Edna Ferber's stories continue to lure the picture makers. Now the Warners are prepering to film \\"So Big,\\" the novel which won the Pulitzer Prize for Miss Ferber in 1924. Barbara Stanwyck will play the leading rôle. William Wellman has been selected to supervise the production and J. Grubb Alexander will write the adaptation.

Gary Lakes, who sang the role when the production opened last month, took over for Aeneas's farewell.    A singer whose voice is properly supported can sing through a sore throat, and in the dead of winter this is more common than audiences usually know. The problems with Mr. Frey's Aeneas could not all be ascribed to illness. From the start, his sound was powerful enough to cut through Berlioz's hefty orchestration, but he sounded fuzzy, as though he were singing with a mouthful of cotton. Persistent pitch problems and stiff acting also afflicted his reading, but it was undoubtedly the cracked notes in the passionate duet with Dido at the end of the second act that persuaded Mr. Frey to abandon the effort.

Military patrols in a small border town  in a fragile Latin American democracy are making a brutal house-to-house search  for a young rebel fugitive. When the hunted man steals into the austere home shared by two nuns, Sister Ana (Veronica Oddo) and Sister Ursula (Elba Escobar), they must make a potentially life-or-death decision whether to hide him or force him to leave.         Ursula, the younger, more hysterical of the two, flies into a panic, since the punishment for harboring a fugitive is death. Ana prays for guidance, and as she examines her faith, her resistance to the authorities stiffens. The nuns' home is theoretically exempt from search because its occupants are nuns, and the civil authorities fear offending the Roman Catholic Church. But their deference  has its limits.    FILM REVIEW","excerpt":"Two Nuns and a Decision of Life or Death"},{"year":"1991","title":"Directed in a composed, painterly style, Miguel Picazo's \\"Extramuros\\" is as staid as a film about the Spanish Inquisition can be. It concerns the clandestine activities of two nuns, Sister Angela (Mercedes Sampietro) and Sister Ana (Carmen Maura), who run the risk of grave punishment for their activities. Most conspicuously, the two contrive to fake stigmata on the hands of Sister Angela, whose newly found public recognition brings her convent great, unexpected fame.    More privately, they also embark on a love affair that is presented as a series of tremulous, stagy clinches fraught with noble passion. The film's gentility in depicting this attraction is modulated by the placid sincerity of Miss Sampietro, and the always larger-than-life emotions of Miss Maura, who can bring desperate intensity to any role.

But no more.   Bungee jumping, a mildly outlaw sport through most of the 1980's, is now a booming business. Enterprises offering supervised jumps from construction cranes and hot-air balloons -- heights reach 320 feet, fees $99 a leap -- have sprouted in at least nine states, including Texas, California and New Jersey.   Though several people have died in leaps overseas, commercial bungee jumping in the United States has a pristine safety record. But the industry's rapid growth is raising concern about a lack of government regulation and uniform training for those supervising the jumps.    Joe Bergman, of Jump Master Bungee in Livingston, N.J., said: \\"We need some guidelines to make sure people going into the business are trained. This is not as easy as it looks. There are a lot of technical calculations you have to make.\\" Human Yo-Yo    For the thrill-seekers themselves, bungee jumping is unmatched for sheer simplicity. It supplies an intoxicating tide of adrenaline for little expense and energy, compared with, say, skydiving, and no advance training is needed. A jumper is provided a body harness that attaches to a set of three, four or five elastic bungee cords. The bungees hook into nylon webbing that is bound around a crane, balloon basket or other structure.   As the jumper plunges earthward, the cords stretch to about twice their normal length and then contract, which by turns cushion the fall and bring on slingshot-like rebounds.   Though no one officially tracks the industry, interviews with bungee entrepreneurs around the country suggest that clients are plunging from platforms and baskets more than 1,000 times a week.    In four years of commercial jumping in the United States, no deaths or serious injuries have been reported. But in 1989, three people died bungee jumping in France, where a single-cord system is used","excerpt":"two of the people died when their cords broke and one slammed into a tower. Deaths have also occurred in Australia, Germany and New Zealand.    After the accidents, France and one state in Australia banned the sport, but bungee operators elsewhere in Australia and in New Zealand have developed safety standards and asked their governments to enforce them, said Geof Pearson, spokesman for World Bungee, an Australian operator.  A Regulatory Vacuum    In the United States, commercial bungee jumping appears to be a lawless province, other than local building codes, zoning ordinances and state liability insurance requirements for entertainment sites.    Debbie Edgecombe, a consumer analyst at the California Department of Consumer Protection, said she had received numerous calls about the sport in recent weeks. \\"People want some kind of standards for this industry, and at this point there are none,\\" she said.   Jane Vidler, a spokeswoman for Lloyd's of London, said companies that sell insurance for unusual risk activities \\"are not touching it at this time\\" because of uncertainty about the sport's potential legal status.   Manufacturers of construction cranes are worried about negligence lawsuits, said Robert E. Zeigler, senior safety consultant at the Crane Institute of America.   The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has jurisdiction over mobile carnival rides, is investigating the use of cranes for commercial bungee jumping. James De Marco, a compliance officer at the commission who is spearheading the investigation, said it \\"may be possible for the Federal Government to enforce industry-generated standards, with the Australian plan as a model.\\"   \\"We are trying to learn as much as possible about the sport,\\" Mr. De Marco said, \\"and will eventually put in a jurisdictional opinion on it.\\"    Even enthusiasts are concerned. John Kockelman, the 32-year-old \\"grandfather\\" of American commercial bungee jumping who with his brother founded the first jump enterprise, in Mountain View, Calif., has written a detailed safety standards manual for a fledgling industry group called the United States Bungee Jumping Association. \\"If people are going to get hurt, it will not be because a cord breaks,\\" he said. \\"It will be human error. This manual can show people how to avoid that.\\"   The roots of bungee jumping are in a South Pacific rite of manhood and harvest blessing. Each spring the \\"land divers\\" of Pentecost Island still twist liana vines into cords, lash them to their ankles and leap from trees or specially built towers.    Modern bungee jumping, using the wrist-thick bundles of rubber strands wrapped in woven nylon, was born on April Fool's Day, 1979, when members of the Oxford Dangerous Sports Club attached bungee cords to themselves and dived from the 245-foot Clifton Bridge in Bristol, England.   In New Braunfels, a resort town near San Antonio, a bungee tower has been erected on a limestone cliff, 120 feet above the Guadalupe River. Half suspension bridge, half gangplank, the tower arches partway across the gorge and ends abruptly in a small platform.   Since the venture, called Bungy Over Texas, opened July 4, Mike Stine, a safety consultant on bungee jumping, has introduced hundreds of jumpers to the chills of free fall. Mr. Stine owns Vertigo Bungee of Lake Tahoe, Nev., which assists entrepreneurs in setting up companies. 'JUMP!'    \\"This will be the most terrifying moment of your life,\\" Mr. Stine calmly told a reporter who quivered on the platform, before shouting, \\"Five-four-three-two-one-JUMP!\\"   He was correct. In the two or three long, long seconds after a jumper's feet leave the tower, breath disappears with startling completeness.   There is a ridiculous, fleeting urge to try to climb the air.   Just when the butterfly-stomach sensation, familiar to riders of roller coasters and fast elevators, seems it will expand beyond what the body can bear, the bungee cords tug at the harness and the first, deep bounce begins. In that instant, exhilaration replaces terror.

Throughout most of the year, sportsmen from all over Britain line their banks engaged in that keenest of Scottish traditions, fishing for salmon on a colorful, hand-tied fly. This is not the timid, intellectual angling of North American trout streams but the hearty, two-fisted manhandling of a 16-foot salmon rod along the craggy outcroppings and raging currents of Europe's finest spate rivers -- those that rise and fall rapidly depending upon local rainfall.   It is also not an enterprise for the faint of heart -- or wallet. The rights to fish salmon in Scottish rivers are often owned separately from the surrounding land, and many rivers are virtually inaccessible because their salmon stocks are held by private individuals or syndicates who reserve fishing rights.  Those wishing to wet a line must book through a hotel with its own fishing rights or rent a private lodge through estate managers who specialize in fishing leases. A week's fishing on one of the better salmon rivers can cost up to $1,500 a rod. (A rod means one person fishing a full day","excerpt":"two or three anglers often divide a rod, alternating with each other in the course of the day, and split the cost.) It's no surprise, then, that few anglers ever release a catch. The salmon are earmarked for the table. Rods and Rituals in Scotland"},{"year":"1970","title":"Meade H.

Roger Norman, impersonated by none other than Rod La Rocque, has many idle hours and evidently a substantial bank account. And, judging by his experiences in this pictorial chronicle, he enjoys enough excitement to cause him to return with satisfaction to the usual uninspiring sights in the rooms of a London club almost any afternoon or evening.This picture opens with beams of light cutting the night's darkness, which turn out to be the thoughts of past airplane exploits of Mr. Norman. In his Piccadilly club he is confronted with what he terms the horrors of peace, which include two elderly gentlemen engaged in an exciting (to them) game of chess","excerpt":"two others lolling on a sofa smoking and another enjoying a siesta in an armchair. Mr. Norman has faced so many adventures during the clash of nations that he is fed up with the soporific influence of post-war days. Being carefree and unattached, he is able to indulge his whim in search of adventure. So he trots off to Greece, where a more or less amiable bandit is making things hum. It is a mere matter of a fade-out and fade-in before Mr. Norman is in a Greek uniform, attached to a body of soldiers hunting Ghika, the pirate of the mountains.Mr. Norman is a misogynist, but beauty in the form of Jania, is thrust upon him and likewise an unexpected slice of adventure. It happens when he discovers one of the Greek officers trying to embrace Jania. Mr. Norman forthwith uses his fists, and after his victim is laid flat on the floor, the victor is somewhat perturbed as the man't heart has ceased to beat. Norman is, therefore, confronted with the alternative of being shot or fleeing with Jania. After miles and miles on horseback, whom does Mr. Norman run into but the redoubtable and imaginative Ghika! It needs but a brief study of the situation for Mr. Norman, the adventure-yearning Britisher, to grasp that he is between the devil and the deep sea.These scenes are pictured in a vivid and subtly humorous fashion. To add to the atmosphere there is a primitive basket elevator used by Ghika to haul up his men and provisions. This contrivance results not only in a thrill or so for Mr. Norman and the bright-eyed Jania, but also for the spectator, who may satisfy his adventurous spirit merely by gazing upon these scenes. Jania, played by Lupe Velez, the termagent of Douglas Fairbanks's \\"The Gaucho,\\" being unusually charming, attracts the vagrant eye of Ghika, and once more Mr. Norman, the woman-hater, discovers that he has to interfere, this time with the moderately, accurately aimed knife. Ghika, having discovered that on a question of law, he may (by sending Norman back to the soldiers) save his own neck, decides to get rid of the officer. The most exciting scene is not when Mr. Norman is seen going down the dizzy height in the basket lift, but when he returns, like a trapeze artist, hanging to the bottom of the contrivance, and then also when he slips from the basket to the cliff, with something like two or three thousand feet of space below.The exaggerated panting of Miss Velez during the supposedly agonizing moments may be excused by the nature of the story. Mr. La Rocque is admirable as the courageous Mr. Norman. Warner Oland has an eye for mirth as well as beauty as the picturesque brigand.On the surrounding program are Pauline Alpert and \\"The Dancing Gobs.\\" There is also one of Will Rogers's travelogues; it deals with roaming through Ireland and has a number of laughs and glimpses of the rich beauty of the Emerald Isle.
