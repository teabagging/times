Dates and times are subject to change.\\nWednesday \\n\\n\\"V. I. WARSHAWSKI.\\" With her high heels up on the desk, Kathleen Turner makes a sexy, droll private eye whose cases and cohorts, unfortunately, don't exhibit anywhere near the same flare in a somewhat drab detective story that could use another star or two and \\"is a lot less glamorous than Ms. Turner's performance\\" (Janet Maslin). 1991. Hollywood. $92.95. 1:29. Rated R.\\nNov. 20 \\n\\n\\"HUDSON HAWK.\\" Somewhere in this smirky, mean-spirited disaster is a plot line about a cat burglar (Bruce Willis) descending on the Vatican, but the result is so confused and pointless that the film becomes more farce than thriller, \\"a colossally sour and ill-conceived misfire\\" (Maslin). 1991. Columbia Tri-Star. No suggested price. 1:35. R.\\n\\n\\"A RAGE IN HARLEM.\\" A fancy woman from Natchez (Robin Givens) smuggles a trunk of gold to New York City and precipitates a number of thin comic adventures with local residents, among them Jackson (Forest Whitaker), Goldy (Gregory Hines) and Easy Money (Danny Glover). All are in good form in a lightweight caper, especially Ms. Givens, who \\"shows a real flair for absurd comedy\\" (Vincent Canby). 1991. HBO. $92.99. 1:55. R.\\nNov. 27 \\n\\n\\"ONLY THE LONELY.\\" John Candy is a man with a mother problem in Chris Columbus's film about the suffocating control a parent (Maureen O'Hara) can bring to bear on an adult offspring. Mr. Candy brings depth to the mother-son struggle, and Ms. O'Hara makes the mother \\"a funny and engaging figure without stinting on the character's truly noxious side\\" (Maslin). 1991. Fox. $92.98. 2:00. PG-13.\\n\\n\\"SOAPDISH.\\" As a soap opera queen, Celeste Talbert (Sally Field) collects award statuettes, frantically outmaneuvers rivals, including a hostile producer (Robert Downey Jr.), and resumes a relationship with a former lover (Kevin Kline) whom she once double-crossed in an old show-biz machination. Michael Hoffman's film \\"enters wholeheartedly into the iffy state of longtime soap opera denizens living in a weirdly elastic universe\\" (Maslin). 1991. Paramount. No suggested price. 1:40. PG-13.\\nDec. 4 \\n\\n\\"CITY SLICKERS.\\" In the midlife dumps, three Eastern dudes (Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby) decide that two weeks on a cattle drive run by a ranch in New Mexico might be just the thing they need to revive themselves. Trying to get at their problems without offending anybody, Ron Underwood's comedy is \\"cheery, earnest, harmless and almost totally lacking in bite\\" (Maslin). 1991. New Line. $99.95. 1:47. PG-13.\\nDec. 11 \\n\\n\\"NAKED GUN 2 1/2: THE SMELL OF FEAR.\\" Leslie Nielsen is once again the groomed, pompous Lieut.

HBO. $92.99. 1:36. R.\\n\\n\\"TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY.\\" A mellowed Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) teams with a body-building mom (Linda Hamilton) to defuse potential nuclear disaster. The summer's big box-office winner, James Cameron's sequel is a \\"swift, exciting special-effects epic that thoroughly justifies its vast expense and greatly improves on the first film's potent but rudimentary visual style\\" (Maslin).

Laura Dern plays Rose, a free-spirited farm girl who works for a middle-class Georgia family during the Depression. Rose falls briefly in love with the head of the household (Robert Duvall), partly initiates his 13-year-old son, Buddy (Lukas Haas), into sex, and stirs things up among the men in town. Martha Coolidge, who directed, brings a sympathetic feminist perspective to the story. (1991. $92.98. Live Home Video. 1 hour 55 minutes. Rated R.)   BOYZ N THE HOOD: In the wake of the Los Angeles riots, the kitchen-sink realism of John Singleton's first feature about life in a black Los Angeles neighborhood seems almost too cozy. But it is still the first mainstream Hollywood movie to begin to capture the texture of daily life in an environment whose ills are usually sensationalized by the movies.

Winona Ryder is the least likely driver, a tiny woman with a dirt-smudged face who dreams of becoming a mechanic. At a Los Angeles airport, she picks up an elegant agent, played by Gena Rowlands, and the two dish the dirt about problems with careers and men.

Happily, video wrist has become a rare ailment as electronic home-movie equipment slims down.

Some six million American homes now have video-cassette recorders, or VCRs. Although the vast majority of VCRs are bought to record programs from television or play back prerecorded cassettes, about 10 percent also serve as home moviemakers.

Topics covered include wounds, fractures, head injuries, insect and snake bites, hyperthermia, hypothermia, sprains, strains and even removing a fish hook from an angler's flesh.    This videotape will let you know what a basic backpacking medical kit should contain, and many will find the demonstrations of various procedures, including bandaging wounds and sprains and dealing with dislocated shoulders and fingers, more understandable than textbook descriptions.    Auerbach is associate professor of surgery and medicine at Vanderbilt University and director of the emergency department at the university's medical center.    The tape is mildly flawed by occasional silly dialogue, as when the narrator, as a way to broach the subject, tells Auerbach that he is under the impression that all ticks are harmless. It is impossible, for this viewer at least, to believe that anyone who can read a newspaper is unaware of Lyme disease or Rocky Mountain spotted fever, both tick-transmitted disorders. And then there is the doctor's suggestion when dealing with someone suffering from hyperthermia, to, after wetting the victim down, to fan him with an article of clothing or a newspaper to hasten evaporation. Backpackers don't usually carry newspapers. But this is small potatoes. The tape is excellent and crammed with good advice.    The videotape bears the title of Auerbach's first-rate paperback (Little Brown & Co., 348 pages, $12.95), which was published in 1986. The book was somewhat revised for the second printing of the first editions and a greatly expanded second edition is in the works. The videotape, which should be regarded as an adjunct to the book, is put out by Centre Films Inc., 1103 El Centro, Hollywood, Calif. 90038, telephone (213) 466-5123, and sells for $29.95.    Although the technique is not mentioned in the first printing of the book, Auerbach's videotape demonstrates how to use the Sawyer Extractor pump, an inexpensive little device that sucks the venom from a snake or insect bite from the victim's flesh.    I have never used the Sawyer pump for a snake bite, but on three occasions have used it to remove the venom from wasp or bee stings. In all three instances, the victims had previously experienced fairly severe reactions, including swelling and pain, from such stings. When the Sawyer pump was used -- you can actually observe a droplet of venom emerging from the flesh -- there were little or no such reactions. There were no reactions when the pump was used within three or four minutes after the sting. In one instance -- when the pump was applied six or seven minutes after the sting -- there was mild swelling but no pain. Obviously, the sooner the suction begins the more efficacious it will be.   This is not to suggest that the Sawyer pump is a substitute in the case of those who develop severe and dangerous allergic reactions to insect stings for a subcutaneous injection of epinephrine, which is available in allergy kits, but merely to note that it provides immediate relief in some cases. At the very least, it can do no harm.   It's worth noting that while honeybees leave their stingers, often with venom sac still attached, in the victim, wasps, hornets, bumblebees and yellow jackets retain their weapons and may inflict multiple stings. Because the venom sac may be present, one should not try to remove a honeybee's stinger with a pinching maneuver as with fingers or tweezers. That could result in the remaining venom's being injected into the victim. Remove the stinger by scraping with a knife or a razor blade, then apply the pump. If the scraping tool isn't instantly at hand, it would probably be wise to apply the pump and deal with the stinger later on.    The Sawyer Extractor may be had for $11.95 from Sawyer Products, P.O. Box 188, Safety Harbor, Fla. 34695, telephone (813) 725-1177.    Another unusual and valuable first aid item that Auerbach used in his videotape is the so-called SAM splint. Made of aluminum that is coated with a closed-cell foam, it is 36 inches long, 4 1/2 inches wide and weighs only four ounces. It can be quickly formed into a variety of shapes, whether as a splint for an arm or leg or even a collar for a neck injury. The SAM splint is manufactured by the Seaberg Co., Inc., P.O. Box 734, South Beach, Ore. 97366, telephone (503) 867-4726. The firm sells the splint -- and a smaller one for fingers -- through distributors. (The suggested retail price is $12.95.) Literature on the splints and the names of the distributors will be mailed on request.

Granted, a good dinner can rarely be found for less than $15 and double rooms in the center for less than $100 are only slightly more available. But compared with cities in Italy and Germany, Vienna -- and Austria in general -- is a reasonably priced vacation spot.    One reason Austria appears affordable is that its inflation is so low -- only about 3.5 percent last year. Whereas in such Italian cities as Venice the price of a simple tomato and cheese pizza has more than doubled, and in some areas tripled, in the last six years, the price of a Viennese melange (coffee with milk) in Vienna has stuck at just about $2, and you can buy one coffee and sit until closing time. A glass of draft beer at a sidewalk cafe is about $1.90. For Americans, the low inflation in Austria helps make up a little bit for the steep fall in the dollar in the last six years. In 1985 the dollar stood at 21 schillings while it now stands at about 12 schillings, a slight improvement over the rate at the same time last year, when it was down to nearly 10 schillings. Egon Smeral, an economist at Vienna's Institute for Comparative Economic Studies, says that German unification has slightly lowered prices in Austria because of more competition, and Austrians are hoping that their entry into the European Community, which is not expected before 1993, will guarantee stable prices in the future.

Questions of authentic style and conductorial predilection are largely moot when the Vienna Philharmonic plays Mozart.

It will depend on our soldiers, those in the desert, those waiting to go and those who have not yet joined the armed forces. This is the legacy of Vietnam.    Already one can hear warnings by parents of those in the desert that they draw the line on actual war. They are only a tiny minority, but because so many are joining support groups across the country, they will swell to a force not to be resisted once the casualties start.   This has been the overlooked development, but from now on our soldiers and their families will have as much to say as the President about how long we remain in any war. The President will be able to marshal our forces and prepare for war, and he will even be able to declare war, but as soon as the fighting begins, his power will depend on the men doing the fighting.

''Bittersweet Memories: A Vietnam Reunion'' represents an unusual venture for television. It was produced in cooperation with Newsweek magazine, which this week is featuring a cover story on the soldiers of Charlie Company, who saw combat in Vietnam in the 1960's. Of the 80 men interviewed for the story, 30 were brought, along with some of their wives, by CBS News to a threeday gathering in Florida.   The idea for the reunion was devised by Howard Stringer, who produced the program with Andrew Lack and Bill Willson. The veterans are seen talking among themselves and being interviewed separately.  The reporter catalyst happens to be Bill Moyers, who recently returned to CBS from public television. The Moyers manner is especially suited to this kind of project. In a one-to-one interview, he is sharp without being hostile or patronizing. In a group setting, he steers the conversation without being obtrusive. He has an enviable gift for connecting powerfully with all sorts of people.

More than two-thirds of all Vietnamese refugee boats that land in Thailand and Malaysia are attacked by pirates, most more than once. ''Attack'' is a term that covers a multitude of atrocities. Theft of whatever valuables the refugees have brought with them is universal. Frequently the attackers also steal the boat's motor or otherwise disable the craft, causing enormous suffering and loss of life. However, violence is the most vicious of all.  On May 6, for example, a boat carrying 31 Vietnamese refugees was attacked twice by Thai pirates. Twelve of the refugees were knifed or clubbed to death and thrown overboard. Three young women were abducted; the possibility that they survived is minimal. Twelve more people drowned when the refugee boat sank while being towed by the pirates. Only four men survived.
