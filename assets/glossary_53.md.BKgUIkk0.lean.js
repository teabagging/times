For over a decade, he served on the Lincoln Center Real Estate and Construction Council where he was twice honored. Moreover, he was the recipient of the Lincoln Center Laureate, the greatest distinction we bestow. In memory of his mother, Belle, his philanthropy showed a special concern for people with visual disabilities. He also had a profound desire to bring the performing arts to the broadest possible audiences through his funding of Live from Lincoln Center telecasts. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Sandra, a full partner in his philanthropic and civic endeavors, and to his children, Deborah, Jonathan, and Adam, and to his brothers Daniel and Elihu, and their entire family, as well as their friends and associates.

IDENTITY: Actor","excerpt":"brother of the actresses Rosanna and Patricia Arquette. AGE: 24. RECENT STAGE PROJECT: Just finished playing Lee Harvey Oswald in the Steppenwolf Theater's production in Chicago of \\"Libra,\\" directed by John Malkovich. CURRENT MOVIE ROLES: Jack in \\"Jack Be Nimble,\\" a Gothic horror film from New Zealand, and Bill in \\"Grief,\\" a film about the writers on a cheesy television show. Q.  How did you approach playing Oswald? A.  When most people play a villain, they play him as bad. They forget that people who do bad things don't see themselves that way. I imagined him as someone who was manipulated, who had a story to tell and never got to tell it. I played him like an Everyman. Q. How did the cast react to the death of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis? A.  Our show has a lot of technical aspects to it. We show the Zapruder film. The night she died, for the first time, we had technical difficulties. Even the mice in cages backstage got loose, and no one could explain why. There was talk of our being haunted.   Q.  Tell me about the character you play in \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. A.  I haven't seen it yet, so it depends what wasn't left on the cutting room floor. He's a drug underling who is supposed to make the two hit men doubt their passion for killing. Q.  The 1990 movie \\"Last Exit to Brooklyn\\" was your big break, right?  A.  It was my first acting job really. My sister Patricia was asked to play the Jennifer Jason Leigh role, but she was pregnant. She went to New York to tell them no in person. She said, \\"Lexy, come with me.\\" The next thing I knew my sister's agent was telling me that they wanted me to play Georgette. I thought they were just using me to get Patricia to take the role. Q.  Had you ever done drag before? A.  Only in a sophomoric way on Halloween. I began researching by going to drag clubs. Though the movie is set in the 50's, I figured things were the same. I befriended these performers who were flamboyant and talented, yes, but they weren't Georgette. She was an addict. She didn't dress to be glamorous. She was a subversive beatnik. Q.  Since then you've created other drag characters, like Eva Destruction, which you perform at clubs. Are you worried about being known as \\"that actor who does drag\\"? A.  I'm not a career drag queen. I certainly don't make money out of it. Now I mostly do it for benefits. People try to trivialize it, and say it's just drag. Mike Myers as Linda Richman and Dana Carvey as Church Lady have become famous with their drag roles.  Q.  Would you ever dress up as one of your sisters? A.  Patricia was meant to judge a fashion show at a club in L.A. She couldn't make it. I threw together an outfit that was identical to her costume in \\"True Romance.\\" We simply introduced me as Patricia Arquette to the audience. I came over later and showed her. Q.  I hear you were upset that Patrick Swayze got the role you wanted in \\"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar,\\" the road movie about three drag queens that Steven Spielberg is producing. A.  Patrick Swayze's far too old and far too straight in my opinion. It's fine if straight actors want to play gay roles because I'm a gay actor who also wants to play straight roles. Of course, Tom Hanks was great in \\"Philadelphia.\\" But I do have a problem that three drag queens are being played by three straight actors. It makes me want to run away and do films in Turkey or India. Q.  Is that why you went to New Zealand to make \\"Jack Be Nimble\\"? A.  When I read the script, I was just stricken by the beauty of it and the kitsch black humor. It's my favorite work to date. It's like all the movies I love, like \\"Carrie\\" and \\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"Eating Raoul.\\"  Q.  What's next for you? A.  The only thing I know I'm doing for sure is a film called \\"Forget-Me-Nots,\\" with John Malkovich, which is going to be another one that gay groups won't like. It's about an unstable man who kills his lover after learning that his lover is H.I.V. positive and hasn't told him. I'm going to be a character that John uses as an alibi.
