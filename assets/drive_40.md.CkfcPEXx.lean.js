To July 28. 324-0806. For 10 years Carroll Dunham has been on most everyone's list of young talents to be watched. He manages to pack power, imagination and energy into paintings that seem original, effective and right for our time. In his latest canvases fields of activity are filled with free-flowing doodles and glandular forms that appear to be mining the science fiction in his subconscious. Like much contemporary art, this work explores physicality in new ways. The lush sensuous color is gutsy","excerpt":"cartoonish creaturelike architectural forms burst with  an uncanny vitality, and sizable round spores protrude from the surface, spreading in a manner that seems out of control. There is a tendency to interpret the clusters of spores as human or technological viruses, or both. Paintings are crowded and abstract, yet suggestions of real-life content can make them appear unexpectedly edgy. Sometimes the organic forms seem part of fantasy narratives or undefined incidents. It is not unusual for the image to be disquieting and for the tension to build through contrasts between the man-made  and the anthropomorphic, the firm and the pliable, the solid and the vulnerable. Scale is unsettling when human characteristics are assigned to geometric buildings. \\"Tower,\\" with its tilting pink structure, gives the impression of a wired world  gone crazy and is one of the show's best examples. Signlike and immediate, \\"Visible Language\\" suggests a cell magnified into a single icon. Line is basic to all Mr. Dunham's work, because it is his primary way of opening the flow of invention. Be sure to see the wonderful drawings in paint and graphite on papyrus in an area adjacent to the main gallery. \\"Carroll Dunham: Paintings and  Drawings\\" was organized by the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum, which is circulating the exhibition.

In truth, its saturation had taken the Chanel look from the peaks of chic in the early 1930's to the depths of banality by the early 1980's. There were a few exceptions. When Mademoiselle Chanel came out of retirement in the 1950's, for one. And later, when designers such as Yves Saint Laurent and Sonia Rykiel have occasionally reworked the Chanel concept. But though the house of Chanel had remained in operation since Mademoiselle's death in 1971, the credit for keeping the legend alive really belongs to New York's Adolfo, who kept churning out variations of the Chanel theme.

In a 1987 case he brought, the Court ruled that the death penalty was not unconstitutional just because far fewer people were executed for killing blacks than for killing whites. Then last year, when Mr. McCleskey argued that the prosecution had withheld evidence from the jury, the Court rebuffed him with a ruling that sharply curtailed the ability of state prisoners to file multiple Federal appeals.  Mr. McCleskey's supporters said he thus faced execution \\"in violation of the Constitution.\\" He lost his last Supreme Court battle at a little after 3 A.M.

If false, it would have been unfair to allow this cloud to linger over the reputations of those accused of being involved.   The task force report concluded there was virtually no credible evidence to support the accusations.
