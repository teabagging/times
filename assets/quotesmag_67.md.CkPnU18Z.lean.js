While black Americans may be making strides as conductors, their membership within orchestras remains pitifully small.

The surrender of Japan and the end of World War II touched off a celebration in Times Square on Aug. 14, 1945, in which strangers hugged and kissed and danced in the street. Today, Times Square will be closed to vehicles as New York City marks the 50th anniversary of V-J Day starting at 4 P.M. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will welcome veterans, entertainers will perform, and 1940's music will be played. People are invited to live V-J Day, or relive it. Depending on one's age, it may seem like long ago, or only yesterday.   During the war, Nora Bender, now in her late 70's, was a hand model for Van Cleef & Arpels on Fifth Avenue.    \\"I saw the parade. I remember Eisenhower turned the corner: He looked happy, thin and fit, and so strong then. People raised their hands and made the victory sign. Everyone talked to everyone else. No introductions were necessary. People said things like, 'Have you heard any more news?' 'What's really happening?' 'Why did we bomb Nagasaki?' \\"     \\"I saw Oppenheimer and his wife at a bus stop on Madison Avenue, and I wanted to ask him how he felt about the end of the war, about Nagasaki, but I was too shy. I can't understand Americans' confusion today as to why we dropped the bomb. We had suffered such tremendous losses in Europe and in the Pacific.\\"       Edith Shain, 77, a part-time nurse at Doctor's Hospital, was immortalized in a famous kiss (above).    \\"When I was kissed, I closed my eyes. I didn't look at him. It was a startling thing. But I thought, this man had fought the war for all of us.\\" After another kiss from a soldier, Ms. Shain and a friend fled back down the subway. \\"I was getting grabbed, she was getting grabbed. In those days we didn't do that sort of thing.\\"      James Landes, 87, captain in the First Army of the Corps of Engineers, was at Halloran Hospital on Staten Island for a spinal injury.    \\"I heard about the Japanese surrender and the guys in the hospital were overjoyed. People shouted, 'We don't have to go!' \\" There was no celebration for us, just relief that the war wasn't going to begin again for us.\\"       James Dematties, 69, a gunner in the Navy Special Forces, was awaiting reassignment at the Hudson River Pier 92, near 52d Street.     \\"We were about 500 guys. They gave us liberty and we went right into town, to Times Square. We really tore up the town. At that time, the Copacabana on 48th Street was free bees and honey. The management opened everything up for us. Drinks on the house. Most of the guys were throwing money around anyway. Money all over the bar, they were so happy it was over.       Angie Perisone, 66, set and tested clocks for bombs at Jaeger Watches on East 45th Street.    \\"It had been terrible before then","excerpt":"blackouts, air raids, news of people killed in action. We did all the flirting and kissing that could be done. We kissed every serviceman on Broadway. There were block parties that lasted almost a week in the neighborhood, and store owners donated food and soda. For the parade in my neighborhood, my sister was the Statue of Liberty.

Contrary to your observation, the rise of Gen. Colin L. Powell to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the positive racial role model that may provide, does not explain why blacks are 12 percent of the United States population but 29 percent of the armed services.   Blacks are two and a half times more likely to join the military than other Americans because their civilian options are so severely limited. Young blacks face an unemployment rate of more than 50 percent.

Whatever farce is, its nature is such that all sober definitions automatically contradict the essence of something that is too buoyant, too breathless and too volatile to be contained by mere words. The best one can do is describe it.   It's Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau, in one of his ''Pink Panther'' films, being blessedly unaware that the putty nose by which he's disguised himself is melting over his upper lip. It's Dudley Moore, in ''10,'' hiding in a large floral display in a church during a wedding ceremony, being stung by a bee. It's Richard Mulligan, as the suicidal movie producer in ''S.O.B.,'' attempting to hang himself on the second floor of his house, only to have the rope snap so that he crashes through to the first floor, to maim severely the Hollywood gossip columnist standing in his line of fall.

Mr. Denman attributes the outcome to a falling economic tide and exaggerated expectations. But neither argument washes.   The breakdown in Brussels developed when the European Community, supported by Japan and Korea, stonewalled appeals by the rest of the world to discipline their trade-distorting agricultural export subsidies and to open their agricultural markets further.   Agriculture has been debated in previous GATT rounds over at least two decades, under varying economic conditions. It is not economic travail that has prevented the development of international rules in this area comparable to what has evolved in the GATT for industrial goods. It is the lack of political will, particularly in Western Europe. If anything, the danger of a global recession should have helped stimulate a positive response by the European Community in Brussels, but regrettably that did not occur.   If expectations were exaggerated, it was the European Community whose views were out of line with those of most of the world, including a host of developing countries. Realizing that the GATT needed to play catch-up in agriculture, nearly all other countries were prepared to undertake major reforms over the next decade. Though change is politically difficult, these countries, including the United States, were prepared to reduce export subsidies dramatically, expose their farmers to global competition and reduce their internal subsidy programs. The European Community, however, wanted to nibble only at the edges of reform.   If there were any negotiations at gunpoint in Brussels, they came from the European Community too -- saying to the rest of the world, \\"We want to protect our markets from your exports, we want to dump our surpluses on the world market, and we want to retain the policies that permit us to do so.\\" That is trade policy at its worst, and the rest of the world will no longer tolerate it. It should come as no surprise that the European Community was isolated in Brussels.   Let's hope the European Community will yet find the political will to salvage these negotiations. Otherwise, all of us, including Western Europe, will pay a heavy price for failure.
