It is the physical heat of weather in a South African township, inside a smoky, airless little bar. It is also the emotional heat of political repression, hopelessness and poverty. And the Ailey dancers created the illusion of both in a low-key but potent performance.   The dance is a homage to Hugh Masekela, the South African trumpet player and composer, and his searing, wistfully melodic music. There is no particular story, just a series of desultory encounters. A tough, sensuous woman who may be the bar's proprietor, danced by Debora Chase, draws the men around her for a moment. A prosperous-looking man, portrayed by Andre Tyson, gets the patrons together and exhorts them to buy, in what could be a pitch for snake oil as much as for political action.

No mean feat, either, for even fewer screen treatises on the awakening of adolescence have examined such a delicate triangle of protagonists—a teen-age lad with an acute case of Momism, his youthful mother and her lover.This one is a comedy-drama, actually not much more than a literate conversation piece. Paul Vandenberghe has adapted it from his own play, with the cast and action kept down to a minimum and the plot unfolded from the youngster's viewpoint. Here we have a lad given to composing sonnets and trailing his attractive, youthful mother, a widow. During a Riviera vacation, he gregariously annexes a neighbor, a wise, kindly middle-aged novelist, into the little family circle.Back in school at Paris, the boy's growing sexual awareness is briefly jarred by a helpful bobbysoxer's initiation and he is horrified to discover that his mother and their new friend have entered into a tender liaison. The pair win him over in a final reconciliation scene, the best of the persuasive, tasteful little vignettes that comprise the picture.M. Vandenberghe's dialogue is exactly right. Director Berthomeiu keeps the story moving with fluency, warmth and conviction. This goes for the performers. Jacqueline Delubac makes a lovely, winsome mother","excerpt":"Aime Clariond plays the writer with gentle incisiveness and Louvigny puts in a few owlish appearances as the uncle colleague of the boy.In this role, one tough assignment, a young man named Gerard Nery shoulders the picture sturdily and carries it.

So the investigators laid out a plan that will take weeks or months to raise a substantial part of the Boeing 767 from more than 250 feet of water, twice as deep as Swissair 111 or TWA 800. The flight data recorder shows a plane that flew ''straight as an arrow,'' as one crash specialist put it, until it plunged, but the cockpit voice recorder is ambiguous.
