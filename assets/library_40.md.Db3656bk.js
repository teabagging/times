Sadly, we must report that the Johnsons now seem a little stale","excerpt":"the best sequences in this picture are familiar clips from their many travel films, while the several reenactments of little episodes in their career, which are used to knit the story together, are stagey and somewhat vainglorious. But for those who look back, as we do, with affectionate memory upon the days when Martin and Osa were consistently in the news and regularly upon the screen with another of their many filmed excursions, \\"I Married Adventure\\" should have a pleasant, nostalgic appeal.The story, as Osa presents it, begins with the departure of the youthful Johnsons on their first adventure—to the South Seas and Borneo. Defeated by rain and fever, they return to New York much depressed, but receive encouragement from Carl Akeley and start off for Africa. Thence the picture unreels a succession of exciting episodes—a lion hunt by natives armed with spears, an encounter by Osa with a charging rhinoceros, the battle between a leopard and a wart hog, the capture of a giant orangutan—taken from such previous Johnson films as \\"Congorilla,\\" \\"Bamboona\\" and \\"Borneo.\\" And it ends with a limp and maudlin apostrophe to the dauntless spirits of the two adventurers.The resurrected sequences are packed with dramatic action, even though they do—in their construction—suggest a bit of staging. But the little scenes by which Mrs. Johnson has attempted to give the story a loose chronology—scenes in which she plays herself very badly and an unidentified actor who never shows his face plays Martin—are pitifully amateurish.The name Leidenschaft (\\"Passion\\") of the new German picture at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre is more suggestive of dramatic thrills than is the action of this run-of-the-mine story of rural life involving poachers, a fine young forester (Hans Stuwe), the charming and comparatively youthful wife (Olga Tschechowa) of an elderly nobleman (Paul Otto) and the usual batch of minor characters. Playing the latter are such excellent actors as Fritz Rasp, Hans Junkermann, Otto Gebühr, Hilde Körber and Traudl Stark, the Viennesse Shirley Temple. There never is any doubt in the minds of the audience regarding the solving of the murder \\"mystery.\\" It seems strange that the Terra concern could not have found something fresher for such a first-rate company and such an able director as Walter Janssen.From a cold-blooded, critical point of view the waste of acting talent in \\"Mi Madrecita\\" (\\"My Little Mother\\"), the Arzoz and Gene production directed by Francisco Elias now at the Teatro Latino, is something fearful. But judging from the way Harlem audiences are weeping through most of this highly sentimental film and cheering and laughing at the happy ending, it is just what they like.Sara Garcia is practically perfect as the elderly mother with one loyal, if thoughtless, son and another son and a daughter almost too mean to be true.

(A mansard roof was destroyed in the 1930s.) The hall, seen above in the 1910s, became famous for masquerade balls after a 1913 fund-raiser for the socialist magazine The Masses and became a hub not only for Village bohemians but also for gay men and lesbians. The artists Charles Demuth, Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray used the hall, as did F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and political and labor leaders like Goldman, Samuel Gompers, Margaret Sanger and Dorothy Day. The Progressive Labor Party was established there in 1887, and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in 1914. In the 1950s and ’60s, RCA Victor operated a studio there, where Arthur Rubinstein, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Marian Anderson and many others recorded.

Hawkins charges that the Administration's youth wage bill is an ''inadequate'' response to teen-age unemployment because (1) it is not specifically targeted to individuals and communities most in need, and (2) it does not ''provide remedial and educational services to address the correlation between educational deficiency and unemployment.'' The ''answer'' to youth unemployment, Hawkins claims, is a $2 billion proposal called the Youth Incentive Employment Act, which would serve only the economically and educationally disadvantaged.   Hawkins's arguments convey the erroneous and overly simplistic impression that the choice between these two pieces of legislation is a choice between right and wrong.

The book was published this past February and made it onto The New York Times and Wall Street Journal best-seller lists.     Marcie Walsh may not be as celebrated a young author as, say, Jonathan Safran Foer. But on the other hand, she didn't have the advantage of an Ivy League education and the support of critics who see her as a master of experimental fiction. In fact, she doesn't even exist. Her book, ''The Killing Club,'' is quite real. It was written ''with'' Michael Malone, the prize-winning (and nonfictional) author of several mysteries, and there are 150,000 copies in print.

At the Beacon Theater on Monday night, in the first of four sold-out concerts, Mr. Robinson's dance moves were one of several elements that kept the crowd entertained. Musically, the show had its peaks and valleys. The Black Crowes have earned a large following by revamping the music of the late 60's and early 70's for a young crowd that never knew it firsthand. The sound borrows heavily from the two-guitar thrust of the Rolling Stones and the Southern boogie of the Allman Brothers, as well as the soul and rhythm-and-blues that both those groups poached. At their best, the Black Crowes overcome their self-inflicted genre exile: \\"Twice as Hard,\\" \\"Jealous Again\\" and a version of Otis Redding's \\"Hard to Handle\\" (all from the band's debut album, \\"Shake Your Money Maker\\") were as groove-worthy as Mr. Robinson made them out to be.

Simon & Schuster. $27.50.   In his classic study, \\"An American Dilemma,\\" published 49 years ago, Gunnar Myrdal wrote that the problems confronting disadvantaged blacks in a dominant white society put a spoke through the wheels of democracy. Yet the Swedish economist recognized that despite slavery and adversity, blacks helped to hold the country's social fabric together. In his chapter on black family life in the rural South, he said that blacks had built up their own kind of close-knit family organizations that were conducive to social health.   Now in \\"Climbing Jacob's Ladder,\\" Andrew Billingsley, a respected black sociologist, builds on Myrdal's work and offers his own surprisingly optimistic study about the inner strength and stability of black families. Professor Billingsley, chairman of the family studies department at the University of Maryland and visiting scholar in residence at Spelman College in Atlanta, finds that like white strivers on the lower rungs of society, blacks also want to gain entry into the American middle class. The new book, a sequel to his \\"Black Families in White America,\\" published in 1968, continues his argument that black families are born survivors and contain the seeds of their own rejuvenation.

For some reason or other the Soviet Government refused to permit the picture to be exhibited, despite the fact that it is a translation of a Russian play.The citizens of the Soviet, however, have not missed much, for this production is not remarkable for its originality nor for its acting. The story is the old idea of a Public Prosecutor finding out that his own wife is responsible for the shooting of a blackmailing libertine. The wide-eyed registering of astonishment by Marie Jacobeni is apt to provoke giggling, as are the expressions of other players. Gregor Chmara darts in and out of the scenes trying to appear funny, but if the audience yesterday afternoon is any criterion of his success, his efforts caused more wonder than laughter.Vera Mirzewa, played by Mme. Jacobeni, is a temperamental wife. Her husband permits her to go from Russia to the French Riviera, and on the train she encounters the rogue, Schegin, who at first hides his countenance behind a copy of Le Matin. Schegin's finances are at a low ebb. Creditors pester him and he therefore decides to blackmail Vera, after pouring forth affectionate phrases and receiving from her letters which she could not show to her husband.A glass of wine goes with most of the supposed dramatic incidents and the little shooting affair, through which the world is rid of Schegin, is prefaced by what might be Burgundy. The slaying is accidental, but Vera, who is seen at the opera just before she pays the visit to Schegin's apartment, hastens back to her box after the supposed murder, with her love letters in her corsage.Through the testimony of witnesses, Vera is suspected by Mirzew, her husband, of being the guilty party. He therefore resigns, suggesting at the same time that Vera be prosecuted for the crime.The jury, having regard for Vera's big brown eyes and her dimpled cheek, decides that Schegin came by his death through an accident and Vera is released. She and her husband are reconciled.This pictorial effort is often puzzling, but it is not as tedious as one might imagine. There are some new faces and some different ideas. Warwick Ward, who may be remembered by his performance as Artinelli in \\"Variety,\\" does competent work as Schegin. Jean Angelo is only fair as Vera's husband.On the surrounding program are Emmet Moore's scenic film, \\"The Land of St. Patrick,\\" and the British Instructional Film Company's short picture, \\"Springtime at the Zoo.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Blackmailer's End."},{"year":"1994","title":"Years ago I met Justice Harry Blackmun and his wife, Dottie, at a judicial conference in Colorado.

At least twice he consulted lawyers when he felt that his privacy was threatened: once in the 1920's, when a newspaper mentioned the ''nervous breakdown'' that precipitated ''The Waste Land,'' and again in the 1950's, when an academic critic probed too deeply into the sexual ambivalences of the poem. And in some of his most famous literary essays he counterbalanced or concealed the confessional nature of his poetry by stressing the ''impersonality'' and ''objectivity'' of the artist. Poetry ''is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality,'' he declared magisterially in ''Tradition and the Individual Talent,'' a formula that was remembered and quoted far more often than the personal aside which follows it: ''But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.''

Mr. Burns's 18-hour series on baseball begins on public television next Sunday, with management and players of the big leagues failing thus far to negotiate the game back to life and come out of the megamillion-dollar sulk over profit- sharing that has left Americans closer to embracing that growing alternative national pastime, cynicism.   Even President Clinton, with his vaunted weakness for talking his way into high-profile dilemmas only to retreat in irresolution, will remain well clear of this one for some while longer, according to newspaper interviews with his aides. And the best the TV highlights could offer last week was a minor league clip of some rookie on a bench suddenly leaping about the dugout after a teammate snuck a hotfoot onto his cleats. Yuk-yuk. At least that spared us another Michael-Jordan-at-bat clip and was a decided improvement over those closeups of Tommy Lasorda lounging like a surly odalisque in the Dodger dugout while his boys of summer slobber tobacco juice and pluck at themselves. Windbag Alert    But one real risk in the absence of the major league game is that the vacuum may be filled by still another outburst from the literary cottage industry that has been profitably wringing baseball as a subject for gross esthetic monographs and nostalgic piffle, for prurient confessions of male bonders and liberal arts graduates on the commercial make for Life's meaning -- in general, for reducing a game of great fun to something that smacks more of the Proustian counterpane than of the vacant lot.

They weren't putting the white person down. They were just wondering. Does he \\n\\nreally \\n\\nunderstand it? The performer has the idioms down pat, the phrasing and perhaps even the voice. But is it more than an imitation of life? Is the burden borne really that burdensome? I have always wondered about that myself.

For the last few months, there hasn't been much opportunity to get out of Times Square. Broadway, showing uncharacteristic signs of liveliness, has grabbed the lion's share of the attention. Two weeks from now, when the Tonys are awarded, there'll be even more grabbing. In the relative calm before that annual orgy of pride and humility, here's a quick look at what's going on in some theaters off the beaten macadam.  'Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn And Other Identities'    You could describe Anna Deavere Smith as a documentary film maker who has simply decided to dispense with the camera. Instead of capturing her subjects on film, she interviews them, then, using their own comments and a few of their mannerisms, portrays them on the stage. In \\"Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other Identities\\" (at the Joseph Papp Public Theater), she assumes the personalities of nearly 30 people -- male and female, young and old, famous and anonymous -- caught up in racial unrest.   If the actress weren't vitally concerned with giving us the truth of each of her subjects, the 90-minute piece could easily come off as so much quick-change trickery. Instead, you are apt to leave the Public thinking that the old saw about every story having two sides vastly underestimates the matter. To every story, especially one as tangled and inflammatory as this, there are as many sides as there are participants. The fact that Ms. Smith takes    all    of them in turn strips the work of any partisanship. The prevailing tone is curiously cool and distanced, even when the actress is depicting behavior that isn't.   In \\"Fires in the Mirror,\\" she is looking into the widely reported racial disturbances that rocked a Brooklyn neighborhood almost a year ago. The trouble began when an automobile, driven by a Hasidic man, leaped the curb and killed Gavin Cato, a 7-year-old black child. Several hours later, in what appeared to be an act of retaliation, a crowd of angry blacks stabbed Yankel Rosenbaum, a 29-year-old Hasidic rabbinical student visiting from Australia, who died shortly afterward in the hospital. Battle lines were rapidly drawn. Riots broke out. By the time they were over, the Jewish and the black communities were eyeing each other across a deep divide of bitterness and suspicion.   What's notable here is how little it takes to transform Ms. Smith. Dressed in black pants and white shirt, the barefoot actress occasionally relies on a prop or a piece of clothing to switch identities. She's not above modifying her voice or, more often, her vocal rhythms. But doing impersonations doesn't interest her as much as communicating essences. If you believe her as the Rev. Al Sharpton or the feminist rapper Monique (Big Mo) Matthews, as Gavin Cato's father or as Roz Malamud, an indignant Jewish homeowner, as an anonymous drugged-out bystander or Yankel Rosenbaum's outraged brother, it's because the actress commits herself fully to their passionate words. And the    words    actually remake her -- hardening or softening her features, adding to her height or subtracting from it.   With the rioting in Los Angeles fresh in our minds, the obvious remark to make about \\"Fires in the Mirror\\" is that it couldn't be more timely. Yet the timelessness of the piece is what impressed me. Put the specifics aside and you have a view of people so at odds with one another that human nature itself seems to be to blame. We are stubborn creatures, claiming right for ourselves and wrong for the other guy, and that stubbornness repeatedly dooms us to violence. Nonetheless, we advance a thousand and one reasons, grand and pitiful, to explain why giving an inch just isn't possible.   Beyond the anger that separates the individuals in \\"Fires in the Mirror\\" is an unarticulated sadness that binds them together -- if only they knew it. 'Ruthless!'    If Rhoda Penmark, that little darling better known as the bad seed, had craved a show-business career and killed for roles, instead of penmanship medals, she might have turned out rather like Tina Denmark, the pre-teen heroine of \\"Ruthless!\\" (at the Players Theater). Such, at any rate, is the operating assumption of the writer and director Joel Paley and the composer Marvin Laird, who have concocted this brash and campy musical spoof. As played by Laura Bundy, Tina is what you'd get were you to cross a cherub with a shark -- a cloud of fluffy blond hair, smooth skin, sharp teeth and beady eyes that just dare you to move.   \\"I was born to entertain,\\" she sings out, in the kind of voice that blows down electrical wires and topples church steeples. Soon after, she is tap dancing furiously on the living-room coffee table. When someone suggests that maybe she should postpone her ambitions and enjoy a normal childhood, she snaps back: \\"I've had a normal childhood. It's time to move on.\\" She's a terror, all right.   In two acts and 14 songs, \\"Ruthless!\\" tries to get to the bottom of what is clearly a genetic predisposition toward celebrityhood. On the surface, Tina's mother (Donna English) seems to be a perfectly normal, if vacant, homemaker in polka dots, while her grandmother, the acid-tongued drama critic Lita Encore (Denise Lor), not only hates musicals, but can barely bring herself to sing her allotted number in this show. Before long, however, surprise twists are playing havoc with the family tree. Everybody is coming unglued and lunging desperately for the big time. That includes Sylvia St. Croix, an imperious, gravel-throated agent (played by Joel Vig in drag), and the frustrated actress turned third-grade teacher (Susan Mansur) who is directing the production of \\"Pippi in Tahiti, the Musical,\\" which first stirs the blood lust in Tina.   While \\"Ruthless!\\" begins promisingly enough, by the end it has veered off into total inanity -- which is not quite as good as total insanity. Even the cheerful score has become relentlessly cheerful. What you have here, I fear, is material for a solid half-hour sketch. (Actually, Carol Burnett would have done it up brown in about 15 minutes.) Dragging it out only drags it down. The same joke -- people will do anything to be in a show -- is made time and again. Each time, it's a little less funny.   Still, I'd be lying if I didn't say the musical has its moments. Ms. Mansur, as the tyrannical teacher with envy lodged deep in her heart and curls like rusted bedsprings piled high on her head, is responsible for a lot of them. 'Empty Hearts'    Cotter Smith and Mel Harris are a sexy couple and they bring considerable heat to \\"Empty Hearts,\\" a courtroom drama with flashbacks (at the Circle Repertory Company). He's a craggy/sensitive type, a Clint Eastwood who can quote Yeats. She comes on smart and tough -- even her nose flips up defiantly -- but underneath she's appealingly vulnerable and needy. As soon as they lock eyes, you sense something's going to combust.   They meet at a state hospital, where Mr. Cotter plays Michael, a psychologist specializing in geriatric care. She portrays Carol, a volunteer with a young son and a lousy marriage. In no time, they're going to dinner. Then, they're going to a motel. And not too long after that, she's left her loutish husband, and she and Michael, draped with flowers, are headed for the altar.   Mr. Cotter and Ms. Harris, who happen to be husband and wife offstage, are thoroughly persuasive in their depiction of buried yearnings and runaway passions. What the playwright John Bishop gives them to say isn't particularly original. But the performers put so much oomph of their own into the relationship that you can get easily involved in their mating games.   Unfortunately, that's the flashback part of \\"Empty Hearts.\\" Its immediate concern is Michael's trial for murder. (Accordingly, the set designer John Lee Beatty has made the inside of the theater into a courtroom.) You, the juror, will gather early on that Carol is the victim, which makes the play not so much a whodunit as a    why   dunit. But the psychological motive, when it finally surfaces, will not have you tumbling from your seat. Until then, Mr. Bishop, who is also the evening's director, hopscotches back and forth between past and present -- the present tending to extinguish whatever excitement is generated by the past.   The supporting players are required to enact two and three roles apiece -- a task that John Dossett accomplishes very convincingly, and Edward Seamon and Susan Bruce accomplish not convincingly at all. Mr. Bishop's title is taken from the passing observation that now and again what seems like love is just \\"empty places desperate to be filled.\\" I wish he'd looked further into the idea.  'One of the All-Time Greats'    In all the years that playwrights have been telling us what happens behind the scenes in the theater -- producing comedies like Moss Hart's \\"Light Up the Sky,\\" Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman's \\"Royal Family,\\" Terrence McNally's \\"It's Only a Play\\" -- no one has ever accused show folk of being bland.   Self-centered, unreasonable, jealous, myopic, sentimental, magnificently temperamental, yes. Bland, no.   The actor and occasional playwright Charles Grodin may be breaking fresh ground. \\"One of the All-Time Greats\\" (at the Vineyard Theater), his comedy about the travails of putting on a Broadway show, is flat and colorless. The characters -- the director down on his luck","excerpt":"the blustering producer lacking in taste; the young playwright hungry for success; the hotshot director who may be hired as a replacement; plus assorted wives, girlfriends and hangers-on -- is predictability incarnate. The drama that has brought them all together is an epic called \\"Thunder Road\\" and is described as a combination of \\"Barefoot in the Park\\" and Kafka.   \\"One of the All-Time Greats\\" takes place in the back room of a Chinese restaurant, where these ciphers gather during previews to thrash out personal and artistic differences; then again, after the opening night performance, to await the reviews, which are scalding. No surprise there. Momentarily closing ranks, they clap one another on the back in a brave expression of solidarity -- which seems to be the fairly insignificant point of this endeavor. We may trust in God, but in times of theatrical calamity we embrace.   The actor Tony Roberts, making his directorial debut, stages the evening at such a glacial pace that the obvious becomes only more so. Renee Taylor, as the luckless director's wryly supportive wife, comes off best. In view of the evidence elsewhere, I suspect her wryness is a native, not Grodin-given, quality. It does serve effectively to shield her from professional harm, though.

During the most violent spasms of the 12-year civil war in El Salvador, a cashiered National Guard officer named Roberto D'Aubuisson preferred to go on television to denounce people he considered subversive. Then they would be killed.   So when an investigatory panel sponsored by the United Nations reported last week on the Salvadoran war's worst violence, most of its findings rang familiar. This Commission on the Truth was in some ways the culmination of the settlement that formally ended the conflict last December. For a country that grew so polarized while at center stage in the cold war that priests became military targets and Mr. D'Aubuisson nearly became president, the panel was meant in part to lay a basis for reconciliation. And in a land where power stemmed from both terror and deniability, it was also meant to provide a clearer sense of reality. But no sooner did the commission offer its conclusions than events in El Salvador began calling into question what effect even an impartial, internationally sanctioned view of the past can have on hatreds so impacted.

This book -- \\"A Schoolteacher in Old Alaska\\" -- is much more important than its self-consciously quaint title lets on. It is nothing like any of Jane Jacobs's other books, and in fact was written only partly by her","excerpt":"the body of it is the memoir of her great-aunt, Hannah Breece, who spent 14 years at the beginning of this century teaching children of Alaska natives. Breece died in 1940, leaving her great-niece a manuscript she hoped would be put into publishable form.         The pleasure in this book comes not from any sense that Ms. Jacobs has reversed course; quite the contrary. She has not elevated Fort Yukon over Greenwich Village, and neither has she put aside her profound belief in the value of serendipity. What she has done is make the point that a sense of independence and of control over one's life is essential to satisfaction and productivity. This is hardly inconsistent with what Jane Jacobs has been telling us for more than 30 years; it is just that until now she has been fairly constant in wanting us to believe that the wide range of choice the city offers  makes it a more likely source of fulfillment and independence than the country.  The truth is that these are virtues that transcend geography, and can occur in all kinds of places and all kinds of situations; perhaps the most important aspect of her new book is that it contains Jane Jacobs's implicit recognition that this is so.

From New York to cities as far away as New Orleans, the police said, the word was spread among reputable dealers and underworld fences to be on the watch for the stolen art objects.   Detectives questioned passers-by in the vicinity of the museum in the hope of finding someone who might have spotted the thief as he made his escape by climbing down a rope from the second-floor exhibition hall where the theft occurred. They also began questioning people previously arrested for art thefts.   Close to 6,500 people visited the museum last Sunday, and one of them, the police believe, did not leave with the others but hid somewhere in the museum's labyrinth of 22 buildings until after closing. He then apparently made his way to a narrow passage between the display cases in the Hall of Mexico and Central America and an outside wall.

By Cathy Luchetti. (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $27.95.) One of the most fascinating things about revivalism is how it reproduces itself, re-creating even in the contemporary world a mood of apostolical preaching established millenniums before. Evangelical Christianity on the American frontier is the focus of ''Under God's Spell,'' a collection of diary entries by 19th-century missionaries","excerpt":"the book also contains an 18-page introductory essay about general aspects of this phenomenon by Cathy Luchetti, the co-author of ''Women of the West.

There are the full-fledged productions, like last week's extraordinarily successful CBS production of \\"Gypsy,\\" starring Bette Midler. And there are the concert versions with full orchestra, several performers and a few props. They, too, can be exceptionally rewarding. A few years ago, public television offered Stephen Sondheim's \\"Follies,\\" taped at Lincoln Center. Tonight on \\"Great Performances,\\" on PBS at 9:30, there's \\"On the Town,\\" taped last year at the Barbican Center in London.

For this performance, directed for the stage by Patricia Birch, the London Symphony Orchestra is conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas. As it happens, he was born in 1944.

(Knopf, $26.95.) In a book about biography as much as about the Brontës, Miller surveys the mythification of the three brilliant bad-luck sisters on the blasted heath of Yorkshire as a growth industry, a process of romantic adoption and transformation that started while Charlotte, the last to die, was still on the scene.    A QUESTION OF BLOOD, by Ian Rankin. (Little, Brown, $22.95.) Rankin's 14th novel (the first was published in 1987) about Inspector John Rebus adheres fairly closely to the procedural formula, though its author sometimes cites the perceptions of the Rolling Stones. This time around, Rebus himself is in trouble for being seen drinking with a man who turns up the following day as a murder victim.    GRACELAND, by Chris Abani. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) Abani's protagonist, Elvis Oke, lives in a slum near Lagos, Nigeria, where the poor pick on the extremely poor, violence is ubiquitous and justice rare. The author was arrested in 1985, when he was 18, in connection with a politically dangerous novel he had written two years earlier.    THE AGE OF SHAKESPEARE, by Frank Kermode. (Modern Library, $21.95.) A characteristically lucid study by a critic and scholar whose overview of Tudor politics and English Christianity serves as background to the breathtaking development of English drama from nothing much to the heights of Shakespeare in less than a generation.    THE ANATOMY OF HOPE: How People Prevail in the Face of Illness, by Jerome Groopman. (Random House, $24.95.) Groopman, a physician and a writer for The New Yorker, derives from the surprising, often troubling stories of his patients the proposition that hope itself is a kind of vital organ that needs mindful handling in negotiations between doctor and patient.    TROUBLE IN MIND: Poems, by Lucie Brock-Broido. (Knopf, $23.) The inner landscape of a poet who has seemed to allegorize her own life has become northern, bleak, full of negation","excerpt":"the book appears to circle obsessively about its griefs as the poet's incantations are directed toward death and the diminished self; elegy and epitaph abound.    DOT IN THE UNIVERSE, by Lucy Ellmann. (Bloomsbury, paper, $13.95.) A cheerfully subversive novel whose heroine, Dot, an inconspicuous wifey in an English seaside town, acquires a taste for blood in an accident and takes to wiping folk out, including herself; after a spell in hell, she is reborn to an American family, but retains, for social observation and comment, all her British powers of snideness.    DANCING WITH CUBA: A Memoir of the Revolution, by Alma Guillermoprieto. (Pantheon, $25.) In 1969 the author, then a 20-year-old Merce Cunningham dance student, took a teaching job in Castro's Cuba. She and Cuba did not get on; though she did her best, she found homosexual artists more appealing than Fidelista officials. She grew up to become not a dancer but a splendid reporter, and this book is a sagaciously observed view of her memories.

Essays by the least earthbound of biographers on subjects like the literary productivity of Romney Marsh and the youthful despair from which he was rescued by the yet more despairing Chatterton.    HITLER. 1936-45: Nemesis, by Ian Kershaw. (Norton, $35.) The second and final volume of Kershaw's biography sees in its subject an unerring sense of other people's weaknesses, fears and vanities, the mental equipment of a malign guru whose followers could project their worst fantasies onto him.    A LIFE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: Innocent Beginnings, 1917-1950, by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. (Houghton Mifflin, $28.95.) The remarkably fruitful first 33 years of a professional historian who analyzed Andrew Jackson, justified Franklin D. Roosevelt, knew everyone there was to know, and would go on to partake of visible political activity.    THE PERSIAN BRIDE, by James Buchan. (Houghton Mifflin, $23.) A novel both epic (it spans the last quarter-century in Iran) and romantic (love, in a specially ''selfless and fatal'' Persian version, drives the events), in which an innocent Englishman's year of marital bliss with an Iranian woman is followed by years of painful travail and searching.    THE TWO HEARTS OF KWASI BOACHI, by Arthur Japin. (Knopf, $26.95.) A rich, spacious and humane first novel, set in the 19th century, by a Dutch writer whose protagonist, an Ashanti prince from the Gold Coast, is more or less taken hostage in the 1830's and compelled to live out his life in an exile that places no value on a black man.    FOUNDING BROTHERS: The Revolutionary Generation, by Joseph J. Ellis. (Knopf, $26.) A scholar's portrayal of the fraternity that founded our nation -- Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Adams, Hamilton, Madison and Burr -- and managed, usually, to solve controversies by personal honor and exertion before settled political structures fell into place.    THE JOURNEY HOME, by Olaf Olafsson. (Pantheon, $24.) This novel's heroine, a tough woman who has been running a hotel in England for 20 years, returns to her native Iceland, keeping a diary in which a lifetime's grave issues burble up; the author, vice chairman of Time Warner Digital Media, wrote the book in Icelandic, then Englished it himself.

THE HUNTER, by Julia Leigh. (Four Walls Eight Windows, $20.) A moody first novel that follows an obsessed Australian hunter in his effort, undertaken on a mission for a biotech company, to find and kill a Tasmanian tiger, a beast as fierce as the hunter himself but believed extinct since 1936.

SCHMIDT DELIVERED, by Louis Begley. (Knopf, $25.)

''The Silver Spoon'' has now been translated into English, and the result -- a big, well-marbled slab of a cookbook -- is catching on with American readers","excerpt":"the book is No. 13 on this week's extended hardcover miscellaneous list, available on the Web. (The only other cookbook on that list is ''Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook,'' at No. 8.) ''The Silver Spoon'' gives good value. It weighs in at 1,263 pages and has some 2,000 recipes, but it sells for $40. It's also full of surprises -- put the cheese on your pasta before the sauce, the authors advise -- and, happily, it hasn't been stripped of its Italian character. (There are piles of recipes here for things like buck's horn plantain, hard to come by in this country.) The classics are covered back-to-front -- there are 23 risotto recipes -- but ''The Silver Spoon'' also works in some interesting margins; you'll learn three ways to cook a calf's head, and methods for making both heart and eel kabobs. The authors can be sticklers.

The director, apparently fearful lest a point be missed, invariably stresses the action most painfully. There are prolonged sequences depicting Wilhelm Spengler's devotion to his son and then there are others dealing with Mrs. Spengler's fits of coughing. In some ways Spengler is an uncouth fool. He is selfish and thoughtless regarding his wife and daughter, but he is devoted to his boy from the time the child is born, incidentally in the first chapter.At the outset one can't help but be struck by the clever detail, which holds out great promise for the production as a whole.There is the bustle and hustle behind the scenes in a big hotel, with flashes of the kitchen and waiters parading with dishes. Soon a familiar back is perceived. It is that of Mr. Jannings, who, as Spengler, is a competent waiter. Spengler is serving a favored party, when his colleague, Gus, whispers in his cry that Mrs. Spengler has become the mother of a baby boy. Spengler, in thinking of the infant, lets a dish slant so that the gravy pours on the immaculate raiment of a lady in white and he is forthwith dismissed by the maitre d'hotel.Spengler's jubilation is slightly subdued by the incident, but his spirits are soon revived when he reaches home, where he proceeds to take the child on a pillow and hold it as he had the dish that terminated in disaster.The time lapses are adroitly evolved, and soon Spengler is beheld as the owner of a saloon and restaurant. During this period, Spengler goes to a waiters' ball, where he sings an aria from \\"Der Trompeter von Saekingham.\\" This song is heard through the innovation of sound. It is particularly well synchronized, but it happens to be intended only as an artless saloonkeeper's idea of melody, which elicits wild hilarity from Gretta, Gus's inamorata. Gretta, played by Ruth Chatterton, after listening to Gus, decides to set her cap at Spengler, which results later in a none too pleasant scene and Mrs. Spengler's sudden death.Mr. Berger has taken advantage of the opportunities offered by the last wet night in the country. He shows the wild gathering in Spengler's place on the night prohibition becomes effective and the eagerness of patrons to buy bottles of whisky and gin just before the clock strikes 12.It is following a suggestion from Gus that Spengler becomes a bootlegger and amasses great wealth. Poisonous whisky is sold through the avaricious Gus's instrumentality and one night Tom, Spengler's idolized son, returns from college. Spengler has married the gold-digging Gretta and turned his daughter, Mary, out of his home. The bootlegger now lives in a palatial dwelling. The table is laid for three, but suddenly the new Mrs. Spengler announces that she is going out for the evening, and Tom, a few minutes later, tells his devoted father that he is dining with society people—the sort Spengler wanted him to meet. So old Spengler is forced to sit alone at his table, and when Tom returns the father is shocked to see his son intoxicated, brandishing a bottle of the liquor from which he. Spengler, had amassed a fortune.Subsequently the old man is crushed by the knowledge that his son has lost his sight. Spengler is sent to prison, where once again he officiates as a waiter, spooning out stew to the other convicts. Years later he encounters his blind son, who has been cared for by his sister and her husband. And so there is comparative happiness.This film is twenty-five years or more of Spengler's life.Miss Chatterton does well as the harsh, loud, calculating Gretta. Mr. Jannings plays as cleverly and then also with that unnatural slowness he did in \\"The Way of All Flesh.\\" Barry Norton tackles a rôole beyond him in playing Tom. Zasu Pitts is splendid as the first Mrs. Spengler. Matthew Betz and Jack Luden give capable performances. THE SCREEN.","excerpt":"The Bootlegger's Boomerang. A Technicolor Film. Stocks and Madness.

The sympathy in the story is on the wrong side of the fence and toward the end it seems imminent that Jack Kells, the bandit leader, is going to shed a few tears. His loyal lieutenant has stopped a bullet and there are only three members of the legion left. Kells, however, does not weep, for another piece of lead comes his way and it is only a question of a minute or so before the head marauder himself topples from the saddle in death.Up to that time Kells had led a charmed life, for he rides in the face of gunfire and is unharmed when the citizens of one place have the effrontery to use dynamite. Although he has killed many a man and feathered his nest with loot, those responsible for this pictorial production seem to feel that he is entitled to a hero's grave. The real heroic character of the tale is sidetracked. He is Jim Cleve, a handsome fellow who does not seem to be long on brains. Jim, however, has the satisfaction in the end of living and riding off with that fair creature, Joan Randall, a pianist, who at one time thought Kells to be quite a charming chap.Among the drinkers in the film is Judge Savin, who is no skinflint, being always willing to stand a round. He also presides in court and winks at hangings. Judge Savin is acted by Richard Carle, who years and years ago used to chant, \\"For I picked a lemon in the Garden of Love, where they say only peaches grow.\\"Monte Blue personates the dauntless Kells. Sam Gulden, the scar-face of those days, comes to life in the form of the stalwart Fred Kohler.

It is chilling now to remember how successful the Nazis were in anesthetizing the world to the barbaric realities of such camps, not only early in the war, but almost to its end.

A celebration of the garden's centennial, this densely installed show concentrates on what might be called a major minor art form -- botanical illustration, a genre with an unusual combination of rigor and seductiveness. As tools of scientific research, botanical illustrations demand absolute precision, so fine lines and well-placed marks are abundant. In addition, the forms under scrutiny include some of the most graceful and complex of nature's creations, among them orchids and waterlilies.

However, the movie, which opens today at the Film Forum 1, owes more to the memory of other movies and the imaginations of other movie makers than to its young protagonist.   In a series of set pieces, Mr. Yevtushenko, the well-known Soviet poet, offers his tribute by imitation to boys' adventure movies, war movies, crime movies, propaganda movies and surrealist movies.   The story follows the boy, Zhenya, played quietly by Sergei Gusak, on and off a train filled with Muscovites fleeing east after the German invasion in 1941.

They encounter the conventional disappointments","excerpt":"the boy, who wants to sing, is labeled vain, and the girl, who wants to dance, is roughly treated because she jazzes up a sacrosanct ballet. Failure and a cruel division threaten until each learns artistic discipline—and then, of course, personal triumphs follow and dew-sprinkled love conquers all.At least, that's the indication in the Soviet-made song-and-dance film, \\"Russian Ballerina,\\" which came to the Stanley yesterday. The major difference is that the nature of artistic expression in this film is a good bit more classical and formal than it is in an average Hollywood job. The boy sings such full-throated numbers as a paean to the defense of Leningrad and the girl dances gracefully and gauzily in standard operatic ballet.With handsome Maria Redina of the Leningrad Ballet playing the girl and with leather-lunged Vladimir Kazanovich playing the boy, that is easy to take. And with Galina Ulanova, one of Russia's great ballet stars, starting things with a beautiful selection from Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake,\\" the mood is good. Ballet fans and those partial to fat music should enjoy these selections very much. But a minor objection to this picture is that the humor and the incidents are flat. In that it also resembles the average Hollywood musical. You pay your money and you take your choice.

But \\"Lies My Father Told Me,\\" the Canadian-made comedy drama that arrived at the Paris Theater yesterday, makes its bittersweet nostalgia pleasurable without cloying aftereffects.Ted Allan's dramatization of remembrances of his own Jewish family in the Montreal melting pot of a half-century ago is brought appealingly alive with the aid of Jan Kadar's perceptive direction and some strong, natural performances.Father, mother, relatives and neighbors are important but not nearly as central to this memoir as 7-year-old David Herman and his bearded, Tevyalike, junkman grandfather (Zaida). They form a mutual admiration society that also includes Ferdeleh, the ancident nag that draws grandfather's creaking wagon (along with a happy David on Sundays) through slum backyard alleys and rich wooded areas in quest of castoffs.Grandfather's orthodox religious beliefs are transmitted to the loving youngster through parables and tall tales. If he accepts them and his Zaida on adoring, ingenuous faith, he is also confused and shattered by the reality of an irascible father, who is a failed inventor of creaseless pants and the like and is constantly seeking loans from the old man for pie-in-the-sky schemes.Of course, the teeming neighborhood scene's varied characters touch on and color the family's life. There are the local young prostitute, a friend of the clients and local kids, who is stridently done by Carole Lazare","excerpt":"the boy's truly doll-like little confidante-playmate, Cleo Paskal, and a gently argumentative Marxist tailor, portrayed to the manner born by the film's author.And there's a termagant housewife, played in vixenish style by Barbara Chilcott, whose complaints about grandfather's stable, its smells and the horse manure David spreads on her backdoor lead to the seriocomic denouement.A properly distraught performance by Marilyn Lightstone of David's hard-pressed young mother illuminates the tension of maintaining allegiances to her son, husband and father. And Len Birman's portrait of the luckless would-be inventor-husband is both brash and pitiable.Dominating the largely Canadian cast is the veteran Israeli actor Yossi Yadin, in a forceful yet tender delineation of the grandfather. His unwavering faith in ancient religious tenets is equal to his love of his grandson and his resigned but wise acceptance of his son-in-law's inadequacies. As the wide-eyed grandson, a newcomer, Jeffrey Lynas, reflects love, innocence, sibling rivalry and the ultimate shock of his grandfather's death with childlike but genuine conviction.The clashes between the grandfather and the father leave no doubts as to the boy's allegiance. And Mr. Kadar, the Czechoslovak director best known for his memorable \\"The Shop on Main Street,\\" is equally pointed in his affection and professionalism. \\"Lies My Father Told Me\\" (actually the harsh truths the boy cannot understand or accept) may be somewhat sentimental and quaint in its Jewish rituals and traditions. But under Mr. Kadar's sensitive guidance, this journey back to lost youth modestly but touchingly reveals people as authentic as the settings in which they are captured.

Cybill and Maryann lunch together, work out at the gym together, stalk Maryann's ex-husband together and commiserate on the trials of life after 40. They're part of a long line of sitcom female best friends. But oh, how those twosomes have evolved! They've always been women of their times. ANITA GATES Lucy and Ethel, 1951-57 Era -- Life revolved around home and husbands when Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) and Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance) were pals on \\"I Love Lucy\\" (CBS). The girls always wanted to go to a nightclub","excerpt":"the boys always wanted to go to the fights. Living Arrangements -- The same New York Apartment building. Specialty -- Silly capers. Balance of Power -- The Mertzes own the building, but Fred (William Frawley) and Ethel are round and middle-aged while Ricky (Desi Arnaz) and Lucy have youth and beauty on their side. Lucy is a little nuts, but Ethel almost always goes along with her schemes, from dressing up as Martians to sneaking into Richard Widmark's backyard. Lucy returns the favor at least once, posing as the Mertzes' maid to impress a visiting friend of Fred's. Togetherness -- The couples go everywhere together (Hollywood, Europe), and when the Ricardos move to Connecticut, the Mertzes soon follow. Loyalty -- Stong, but when Lucy loses her bit part in an Italian movie by soaking up local color literally (during a fight with a fellow grape stomper), Ethel accepts the movie part herself. Gleefully. Mary and Rhoda, 1970-74 Era -- In the 70's, when Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore, right) and Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) were best friends on CBS's \\"Mary Tyler Moore Show,\\" working women who were over 30 and single had to stick together. Living Arrangements -- Apartments in the same Minneapolis house. Specialty -- Moral support. Balance of Power -- Mary is prettier and thinner and has a better job (television news producer; Rhoda is a window dresser) and a nicer apartment. Even Rhoda's mother likes Mary better. But Rhoda is braver (she even calls Mary's boss by his first name). Togetherness -- Largely home-base, although Rhoda does turn up at Mary's office now and then. Loyalty -- Strong. Mary takes in Mrs. Morgenstern when Rhoda decides she can't deal with one more maternal visit. Rhoda stays up all night helping Mary meet a deadline for writing obituaries. Still, after four seasons, Rhoda dumps her and leaves town faster than you can say \\"spinoff.\\" Laverne and Shirley, 1976-82 Era -- ABC's \\"Laverne and Shirley\\" was set in the 1950's (as seen nostalgically from the feminist 70's), when single women shared a single goal: as Shirley says just after Laverne has gone face-down into a chopped-liver sculpture, \\"I just thought that we might meet a couple of rich guys.\\" Living Arrangements -- Laverne De Fazio (Penny Marshall) and Shirley Feeney (Cindy Williams) share a modest apartment in Milwaukee. Specialty -- Silly man-hunting capers. Laverne gets her hand stuck in a crematory urn while trying to impress a handsome mortician. Balance of Power -- Shirley is naive. Laverne is manipulative. Togetherness -- They work together at a brewery and double-date a lot. When Shirley really, really wants to attend a cocktail party at the Pfister Hotel to meet businessmen, Laverne accompanies her, even though she has just completed a sleep-deprivation experiment and keeps sliding to the floor. Loyalty -- After the characters relocate to California, Shirley marries and moves overseas, leaving Laverne to face cancellation alone. Kate and Allie, 1984-89 Era -- On CBS's \\"Kate and Allie,\\" 1980's women had problems that Lucy and Ethel could barely have imagined. Living Arrangements -- Kate McArdle (Susan Saint James, right) and Allie Lowell (Jane Curtin), both divorced, live with their total of three children in a big New York apartment. At one point, they pretend to be lesbians so the landlady won't throw them out for being a two-family household. Specialties -- Hugs and late-night talks about love, children and life. Balance of Power -- Kate is cooler, more worldly; Allie is old-fashioned and keeps tranquilizers in the spice rack. Togetherness -- Allie stays home to cold-shower Kate out of an accidental sedative overdose. Kate rushes home from work when Allie calls, panicked about her 17-year-old daughter's intentions to have sex. Eventually the two women open a catering business. Loyalty -- Even after Allie remarries, Kate moves in with her. Patsy and Edina, 1992-  Era -- The 90's, but the dissolute, self-indulgent heroines of \\"Absolutely Fabulous\\" (BBC; shown here on Comedy Central since 1994) refuse to leave the 60's. Living Arrangements -- No one understands Edina Monsoon (Jennifer Saunders, left), who lives in a chic London house. Thank God for Patsy Stone (Joanna Lumley), who lives somewhere within taxicab distance and keeps moving in. Specialties -- Drinking (Bollinger is a favorite), drug use (Patsy smuggles marijuana into Morocco in her Ivana Trump hairdo), shopping, belittling Eddy's annoyingly sensbile teen-age daughter, Saffron (Julia Sawalha), and complaining in spoken italics (\\"Why can't life just be made a little easier?\\" Eddy asks a traffic court judge). Balance of Power -- Patsy, a magazine fashion director who often can't find her office, has the more glamorous job and looks. But Eddy, a publicist, holds all the cards, as her daughter and her best friend fight for her love. Togetherness -- Absolute. When Eddy was hospitalized for foot surgery (a lost acupuncture needle), Patsy checked in for moral support -- and a face-lift. Loyalty -- Total. Who but Patsy would call Saffron pretending to be the Betty Ford Clinic confirming Edina's reservation? Hope and Gloria, 1995-  Era -- Here and now (NBC's \\"Hope and Gloria\\"). Living Arrangements -- The same apartment building in Pittsburgh. Specialty -- Too soon to tell. Balance of Power -- Mixed. Hope Davidson (Cynthia Stevenson), recently dumped by her unfaithful husband, is a television producer so meek she accepts applying cream cheese to her boss's bagel as part of her job. Gloria Utz (Jessica Luncy) is a twice-divorced hairdresser and mother of one who carries a tote bag the size of a coffee table and talks back to just about anyone. Togetherness -- Growing. They do visit each other's apartments constantly. Loyalty -- Promising, but Hope could have been alittle more supportive when she hired Gloria at the television station, then pretty much took the job offer back. Through Thick and Thin (Thin?

By some productional miracle, the film achieves the lusty, amoral quality of the original city, the city of prodigious growing pains, the infant Gargantua of the prairies, in spite of the Hays office—which is probably Art. Vulgar, ostentatious, squalid, exuberant, bawdy and delightful (to contemplate, at least) Mr. Zanuck's Chicago makes Carl Sandburg's metropolis of bohunks seem as literary and anemic as the Hamptons.Patrick O'Leary (J. Anthony Hughes) driving West with his Celtic brood, talks and dreams of a great city in the plains. But impulsively racing with a Currier & Ives locomotive, Patrick is dragged out of his covered wagon to death—a senseless death, an accidental overflow of a people's vast energies. In a brutally powerful yet hauntingly effective sequence, Henry King uses the sound of the victorious train whistle, distantly receding, to accentuate the horror and despair of the O'Learys, and the desolate crying of the youngest O'Leary for a father who lies dead in the wilderness.From Patrick's grave to the sprawling city of mud, gambling dens, gay ladies, is a mere camera dissolve. The Widow O'Leary, solidly portrayed by Alice Brady, industriously plies the trade of a washerwoman","excerpt":"the boys grow up, clash on certain ethical matters, but are still O'Leary's—and Niven Busch by the way, has not only accepted the O'Leary theory of the fire's origin, but has made the O'Leary tribe the sociological and politics backbone of Chicago. Disapproving of Tyrone Power, who owns the town's most prosperous saloon, Mama O'Leary continues to occupy her miserable frame house in the district known as \\"the Patch,\\" and it is established early in the picture that her cow is a kicker. (Keep your eye on that cow.)Pricelessly in the period is Power's wooing of Miss Faye who, as a commercially minded lady called Belle Fawcett, thereafter moves her baroque wardrobe and her repertoire of songs from Brian Donlevy's establishment, to Tyrone's place, which promptly becomes the rage. By knifing the now impotent Donlevy at the polls (after coolly accepting his bribes) Tyrone elects his brother to the office of Mayor, the latter holds out for reform, and just when Tyrone is on the verge of fratricide, or something, Mrs. O'Leary's cow kicks over the legendary lantern.At the first cry of \\"Fire\\" the screen suddenly flowers into beauty, violence and terror. The ineffectual bucket brigades, the tangle of confused apparatus, the headlong plunging of fire horses around congested corners, the confusions of a fleeing populace, are expounded with enormous gusto and relish, like facts worth recounting for their town sake (and properly so).The script by Lamar Trotti and Sonya Levien is to be commended, as something better than merely an excuse for an excellent piece of antiquarian cinema; Mr. King's direction, occasionally, is inspired, and the photography has unusual style and dramatic impact. Incidentally, the film is a paradise for bit players and extras, and for secondary people like Andy Devine, Mr. Donlevy, Phyllis Brooks, Tom Brown, Sidney Blackmer and June Storey, who acquit themselves admirably.

The callery pear bears white flowers in the spring, although the flowers are somewhat hidden among the leaves that emerge before they bloom. Its modest 20- to 30-foot height makes the pear well adapted for small gardens and other sites with limited space. Many individual plants produce a striking fall color that may range from crimson to wine purple. The fruits are small and insignificant, so they do not make a mess that must be cleaned up.\\n\\nIn the 1950's, an exceptionally attractive seedling of the callery pear was selected and named the Bradford pear. It contains all of the good features of the species, including what was thought to be an especially attractive form. It grew rather slowly into a narrow, upright tree 12 to 15 feet in height within a 10- to-12-year period. This form made it well suited to planting where there was little space for a tree to grow in width. It seemed to be especially well adapted for planting along streets and sidewalks, where a wide-spreading tree would interfere with traffic. Increasing numbers were planted in these sites year after year as landscape architects and nurserymen, along with well as consumers, became familiar with the tree.

As a corporate pilot for Primerica and most recently Dun & Bradstreet, Mr. Milano has flown around the world half a dozen times as captain of Gulfstream and Falcon jets. And because of his flexible schedule as a corporate pilot, in which he flies only 8 to 11 days a month, he has had time to develop a business of his own, Ardsley Mobil Automotive Service Center, which he says is the only high-technology service station of its kind in Westchester.    \\"What gives us that distinction is a brake-testing machine I had installed after I bought the station seven years ago,\\" Mr. Milano said. \\"It is an extremely sophisticated and expensive piece of equipment, which cost us $35,000, but technically it is the state of the art,\\" he said. \\"This level of equipment isn't for the average service station, but we wanted to attract demanding customers. We excel in Jaguar repairs, and I thought it would be a great marketing tool. There are only four machines of its kind in all of New York State, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\\"    For the mechanically ungifted, Mr. Milano described the brake tester as \\"a computerized machine that literally gives customers an 'EKG' profile of their cars.\\" The process is the same, he said. \\"When the car goes up on the rack, the brake tester makes a diagnosis in as little as a minute. But in that time the car is weighed. The wheel alignment on all four wheels is checked","excerpt":"the brake-system performance is analyzed, and then all the information is cranked out in a computerized report.\\"  Satisfaction and Profitability    The printouts, he said, which are given to the customer, enable them to monitor their car's performance.    \\"There are a lot of things that can go wrong with a car,\\" he said. \\"If a customer is driving to Florida, for instance, and has car trouble, the print-out contains valuable information that will be useful to a strange mechanic.\\"    The brake tester, he said, is paying its way in customer satisfaction and profitability. \\"It yields so much important information that even car dealers and other service stations bring in their cars to us for a testing.\\"    Customers having work done on their cars are not charged extra for an inspection on the brake tester, Mr. Milano said, but someone wanting only a checkup would be charged $40 plus tax. The hourly labor rate varies from $65 to $75 depending on how \\"exotic\\" the car is.   Mr. Milano, who is 35, said he has been working at the station in one guise or another more than half his life. \\"When I was in school I had a part-time job there,\\" he said. \\"The station is a landmark in Ardsley. There has been a service station on the same corner since 1926. It was previously known as the F.H.L. Service station when it was owned by Floyd Lichtenberg, when I was a kid. Many years later I bought it from Mr. Lichtenberg.\\"  A Changing Industry    But, he said, the station he worked in as a teen-ager bears little resemblance to the one today. \\"Those 'Gasoline Alley' days are gone,\\" Mr. Milano added. \\"I remember when I was in high school, everybody with even a slight mechanical bent used to tinker with their cars. But today, you can't monkey with a car. It's even impossible to change carburetors because high-tech computer microprocessors control their function.\\"    A few years after he bought the station, Mr. Milano said, he realized the best way to keep business growing was to upgrade the service. \\"The industry was changing,\\" he said. \\"It was becoming so specialized that technicians were needed to service cars instead of mechanics. It was expand or die. We decided to expand.\\"    Using their own money, Mr. Milano and his wife, Isabel, who is his partner and takes care of the bookkeeping and business end of the business, invested about $750,000 to remodel the 5,000-square-foot building with five king-size bays.    \\"At the station we only do mechanical work,\\" Mr. Milano said. \\"We're set up like a dealership in that every car we work on gets dealer parts, and every car we service is tested on the brake machine for free.\\"  Jaguars a Specialty    Customers come from all over the county and include many Jaguar owners. \\"Jaguars once had a bad rap for always being in the shop,\\" Mr. Milano said. \\"But they have been vastly improved. We service both the brand-new models and the classics. We even find original parts for the classics, but like any other high-powered car, they both need periodic checkups. The way I started servicing Jaguars is that some of the executives I fly for brought their Jaguars in, and through word of mouth other Jaguar owners followed.\\"   In addition to the equipment that he has installed, Mr. Milano employs 21 technicians. \\"They receive ongoing training weekly at an automotive facility,\\" he said. \\"They also have a library of service manuals, electronic technical service bulletins and access to a technical hot-line service.\\"   He continued: \\"We're not talking about mechanics, but highly skilled, highly educated individuals who are looking not for jobs but careers here. They earn $35,000 at the beginning and can work up to $70,000 with full benefits included.\\"  Fascination With Jet Engines    The connection between his own two careers, he said, is his mechanical ability. \\"It was the mechanical aspects of flying more than the romantic idea that attracted me,\\" he said. After graduating from St. John's University in Queens, with a bachelor's degree in administration, Mr. Milano continued his studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla. \\"Embry-Riddle is known as the Harvard of the aeronautics industry,\\" he said. \\"I went there because I was fascinated with jet engines.\\"    Two years later, Mr. Milano graduated with an associate degree and received a license as a commercial pilot and flight instructor.    \\"My first job was with a Cessna dealer teaching classes of 10 students how to fly,\\" he said.  Victims of the Recession    The planes he flies for corporate clients have all been based in hangars at Westchester County Airport.    \\"What isn't common knowledge is that the Westchester Airport is the largest corporate jetport in the world,\\" he said. \\"And when it comes to the travel activities of executives, corporations prefer to keep a low profile.\\"    Recently, he said, more than one corporate jet had become a victim of the recession. \\"When corporations have to cut back, the $30 million jet may be one of the first things to go,\\" he said. \\"A lot of corporations are using commercial airlines today, which is another reason I am very glad to have a business. We expect to do $1.5 million to $2 million in sales this year, which is up 20 percent from last year's figures.\\" The Business That a Brake Tester Built"},{"year":"1958","title":"Mergendahl, C: The Bramble Bush The Doctor Takes a Wife","excerpt":"THE BRAMBLE BUSH.

At yesterday's first showing, however, the lines spoken by the players were frequently very indistinct, which may be owing to the studio recording or to the sound reproduction in the theatre.The story is one of those see-sawing affairs about two English officers who quarrel over their love for a married woman. Many of the incidents are far from convincing, but it is interesting to witness Mr. von Stroheim's performance, this time somewhat mechanical, but here and there quite effective. It is he who plays Victor Sangrito, the husband of Alva (Miss Damita), with whom Captain Roberts (Mr. Menjou) and Lieutenant Nichols (Mr. Olivier) are in love. To add to the complications, Sangrito, a connoisseur of porcelains, one day uses a whip on his fair wife and a secretary picks from a case a pistol, which is conveniently loaded, and kills the savage husband. When he is out of the way, it might seem an easy matter to have either Roberts or Nichols appear at the psychological moment for the purpose of marrying the young widow, but the author decides to have Alva temporarily engaged to another man by that time.Part of the picture is laid in London, after which it is tranferred to the Indian frontier, where Roberts and Nichols are in uniform. It is there that Roberts discovers through a photograph of Alva in Nichols's quarters that the younger officer and he are infatuated with the same woman.Victor Shertzinger, the director of this film, has not handled the situations with any marked finesse. The men squabble like a pair of flappers and then decide to burn Alva's photographs and letters. Afterward they return to London and encounter the object of their past affections in the home of General Armstrong and the jealousy of the two officers flames forth again. To the spectator it seems as though Alva had a perfect right to choose the man she loved, but apparently young Nichols thinks otherwise. In fact he feels so strongly about it that he threatens to shoot both Roberts and Alva. As it hardly seems possible that the film will wind up with a double murder and a possible suicide, there is little or no suspense concerning Nichols's threats, even though he fires a bullet through a valuable print and thus arouses the anger of the old General.Frederick Kerr as General Armstrong sounds a true note, and curiously enough his lines are always understandable. The other players give competent performances, but there was at this initial exhibition always a strange incoherence about many of their utterances.Among the items on the stage program is \\"Armistice Memoriam,\\" with Martha Atwood and a male chorus. It is extremely effective. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Brave and the Fair, and a Thriller From, the Sherlock Holmes Detective Series. A Conan Doyle Tale. Cinderella Wins Out. A Jolly German Operetta.

Correction"},{"year":"1991","title":"Domestic triangles consisting of a husband, a wife and another man are common enough","excerpt":"the bridge equivalent is very rare indeed. The third side of a triangle that is believed to be the first in major American championship competition was completed a week ago at the Spring National Championships of the American Contract Bridge League in Atlantic City, N.J.   The first side was put in place three years ago, when Henry and Kitty Bethe of Manhattan were part of a team that won the North American Swiss Teams in Anaheim, Calif. A year and a half ago Mrs. Bethe was a member of the winning American squad in the World Women's Team Championship in Perth, Australia. And four months ago, in San Francisco, she produced the second side of the triangle by winning the Swiss Teams again, this time partnering Larry Mori of Ballston Lake, N.Y.   When the Atlantic City Nationals began, Mori was due to play again with Mrs. Bethe. But she could not take time off from her work as a systems analyst for the Bank of New York and her husband took her place. He is a Vice-President of a rival institution, Chase Manhattan, and had no trouble in forming a first-time partnership with Mori, a clinical social worker. They won the Open Pairs by a margin of one match point at the end of two days, which is like winning a mile race by an inch. The triangle was complete.   The unlucky losers, falling just short, were Zia Mahmood of Manhattan and Fred Chang of Flushing, N.Y. This added up to an outstanding performance by players of Asiatic origins: Mori is American-born of Japanese parents; Zia is from Pakistan and has twice come close to winning a world title for that country; Chang, an engineer by profession, is from Taiwan. In close pursuit at the end of the event, and finishing fourth, were Edith Kemp Freilich of Miami Beach, Fla., who has had a great career in the game, and Margie Gwozdzinsky of Manhattan, who was Kitty Bethe's partner in the Perth victory.   The title was won and lost when Bethe and Mori played against Zia and Chang and took nearly all the available match points. There was some irony on the diagramed deal: Zia was in a game contract that an ordinary player would make routinely. He failed -- partly because he is a great player, and partly because the defense was tricky.   Zia landed in a normal contract of four hearts, after East had overcalled in spades. West had modestly raised to two spades, recognizing that his partner's overcall had to be a minimum in the light of the opposing bidding. The three-spade cue bid followed by four hearts was a mild slam suggestion.   Bethe as West led the diamond king and Mori dropped the queen. This clearly showed the jack, a standard signal, since a singleton queen was impossible, and the eight was led to the ten. A trump was returned to stop the impending diamond ruff, and Zia's game was in jeopardy.   In this position at another table the declarer had reached five hearts. With only one chance to make 11 tricks he drew trumps and finessed the club 10. When this succeeded he was able to ruff his way back to his hand in spades and finesse again in clubs, acquiring a very lucky top score.   But Zia needed only 10 tricks, and suspected from the bidding that the club king was on his right. He took all but one of his trumps and reached this ending: [ DIAGRAM ]    The last trump was led and West and North gave up a club. East threw the spade jack, and Zia settled down to work it out. He was sure East still had the king-queen of spades, and he appeared to have no more diamonds: He had cleverly thrown the diamond jack, a card he was known to hold.   So it seemed that he was clutching the guarded club king, and Zia led to the spade ace and exited with the spade ten. He thought he was forcing a lead from the club king, but Mori produced the diamond seven to defeat the game and win the title.   Should Zia have seen through East's tricky defense? Perhaps. He might have asked himself why West would save all his diamonds if he had started with five. But Mori must get credit: If he had saved his diamond jack, which Zia knew about from the play to the first trick, the contract would surely have been made.

For, as Mr. Scher argues, these medals were considered the perfect vehicle for the sitter's aspirations of immortality. Emperors, popes, the Medici and wealthy merchants all had their images captured in this medium. Strangely, however, for all their beauty, the medals have wallowed in art-historical obscurity while Renaissance architecture, painting and sculpture have been studied in great detail. \\"The Currency of Fame\\" seeks to correct this imbalance.

One enters a field where great loss of life once took place. Perhaps even more than in a cemetery, one feels the presence of spirits here because this is where soldiers fought and died. The Battle of Chickamauga, which took place Sept. 19 and 20, 1863, roughly eight miles below Chattanooga, was one of the bloodiest engagements of the Civil War. There were 2,268 Confederate soldiers killed, and 1,656 from the Union. (The total of dead, wounded and missing at Chickamauga came to around 34,000, enough to populate a fair-sized town.) Tactically, it was a Southern victory, but in the costly victory (and in not pursuing their enemy when they had him whipped) the death knell of the Southern Rebellion was sounded. As Gen. D. H. Hill of the Confederacy said afterward: \\"It seems to me that the elan of the Southern soldier was never seen after Chickamauga","excerpt":"the brilliant dash which had distinguished him was gone forever. He fought stoutly to the last, but after Chickamauga, with the sullenness of despair, and without the enthusiasm of hope. That 'barren victory' sealed the fate of the Southern Confederacy.\\"   Visiting Chickamauga in early July of this year, I spent my first night a hair's breadth from the federally preserved boundaries of the battlefield, in the Fort Oglethorpe Motel, the last outpost before the gates on U.S. 27 (or Georgia 1). The accommodations were rather Spartan, in keeping in a way with a military excursion: No swimming pool, no coffee shop, a cinderblock feel to it. But there were treats. Osmo Marshall, the proprietor, kept a collection of original unpublished Civil War letters and journals in his office for guests who were interested. \\"You'll get a real picture of the war that way.\\" However, he couldn't find them by the time I moved off the front lines to one of the standard motels by Interstate 75 that provided a more customary array of services.   I later learned that the Fort Oglethorpe Motel stands on the very ground where Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry had camped during the battle. My grandfather, Cpl. William A. Bowers, C.S.A., was a trooper in Forrest's Corps. That fact brought on an odd sensation that fit in perfectly with the battlefield's hallucinatory effect. Narrow U.S. 27 now slices through the heart of the preserved battlefield; at the time of the fighting it was called the LaFayette Road. Anyone who knows anything about Chickamauga knows about the LaFayette Road. It was the principal line that separated Union and Confederate forces. Driving along, one sees, amid the green sloping hills and from out of the dense cluster of trees, the brass cannons of war, seemingly ready to unload a round or two.   The Visitor Center, a commodious brick building, is immediately to the right as one enters the park's gate from U.S. 27. An average of around 1,400 tourists pass through it on any given day, the first stop for any tour. Here one may pick up audio cassettes that greatly enhance a visit. It would be fine to cover the terrain on foot, as the infantry did, but impractical considering the time, energy and more than 8,000 acres to be covered.   It is a good idea, too, to read an account of the battle the night before touring the actual ground. Chickamauga was a complicated battle, begun by chance when Brig. Gen. John M. Brannan of the Union was dispatched to capture a stray Confederate brigade at Jay's Mill, a small sawmill at a turn in the road, and encountered instead an entire Confederate division as well as Forrest's cavalry on that early September morning.   I got out of my rented car at the Jay's Mill site and tried to imagine the hot contest that went on there: Nathan Bedford Forrest in a long white linen duster, a brace of pistols at his waist, a cavalry saber in hand, barking orders through the dust and din -- and scattering Yankees. Jay's Mill is long since gone, but the terrain, according to park historians, looks pretty much the way it did then. Throughout the battlefield monuments and statues loom majestically and have a way of turning one's thoughts inward. Since the landscape is spread out and the foliage dense, one never gets the feeling of being crowded although hundreds may be making the tour at the same time. I found not one shred of litter.   In the woods near the mill, off the beaten track, I found the spot where Gen. Braxton Bragg's headquarters stood. It is reached by a footpath, past some bramble, and is in keeping with the spirit of poor, hapless, ill-fated Bragg, who had trouble controlling his army and understanding what was happening in battle. On the fiercely bright day of my visit nearly everything was sun-kissed save Bragg's spot, which seemed airless and cramped. Trees overhung it and no birdcalls resounded. Sam Watkins, a Confederate private from Tennessee, wrote in his lively memoir, \\"Company Haitch\\": \\"Not a single soldier in the whole army ever loved or respected\\" Bragg. With superior numbers and some uncharacteristic good luck, Bragg \\"won\\" the Battle of Chickamauga. But he didn't press his advantage, and the Yankees regrouped in Chattanooga under Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, and soundly thrashed Bragg and his Confederates there two months later. Bragg blamed everyone but himself.     No matter how much one has pored over various accounts of the Battle of Chickamauga, being there ultimately changes one's idea of it. A battlefield may hold spirits and give off reverberations -- but, unlike images from a book or from a lecture -- a battlefield is geography. It remains a part of the earth. In a way, one experiences the battle afresh by being there, and one can get disoriented just the way soldiers do in combat. I recommend carrying a compass. At the Brotherton farmhouse west of the LaFayette Road, where Gen. James Longstreet broke across the road and through a gap in the Federal line, I had trouble telling north from south, east from west. There were simply too many markers, too much to drink in.   Farther along, on a grassy knoll three-quarters of a mile northwest of the tour road, the location of the headquarters of the Union commander, Gen. William S. Rosecrans, is marked. In his own way Rosecrans was just as star-crossed as battered Bragg. In the heat of the second day of the battle, while Longstreet's men were wildly throwing the Union forces back, Rosecrans -- heretofore an almost flawless general -- lost his bearings and his nerve and lit out for Chattanooga. Just up and left the field and skedaddled to safety. He had barely recovered when Grant came fresh from his triumph at Vicksburg and took his place. But Rosecrans was a man of good cheer, too -- expansive, adored by his men -- and his open, grassy spot on the field at Chickamauga is in keeping with his sunny, likable disposition.   Union General George T. Thomas, a Virginian from old stock, was the real hero of this battle. The spot where this Rock of Chickamauga made his stand, and prevented a debacle -- Snodgrass Hill -- fittingly rises at the end of the taped tour. Hordes of Longstreet's troops had rushed the hill on the 20th, overpowering its defenses, but were  repulsed at each assault by Thomas's men. The very last desperate attack was led by Confederate Gen. Archibald Gracie, who wore gray but came from New York City. (Mayor David Dinkins now lives in Gracie's ancestral home by the East River, which was built in 1799.) Snodgrass Hill was smaller than I had imagined, and the Snodgrass farmhouse near the top, which served as Thomas's headquarters, is no great shakes either, more cabin than antebellum residence. One is reminded here that Chickamauga was frontier territory when the battle took place -- it was no Fredericksburg or Gettysburg. It had been farmed by frontiersmen for scarcely more than a decade, having been taken from the Cherokees when the Civil War began. Farm animals -- pigs and cattle -- had been accustomed to foraging in the Chickamauga woods, munching the bramble, and the battling troops only had to contend with a minimum of obstruction between the trees.   A short drive north of Chickamauga, close by Chattanooga, the later battles of Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge raged, both fought in November of the same year, crucial battles that opened the so-called Gateway to the West, making possible Gen. William T. Sherman's sweep to the sea. It is approximately 18 miles by car from Chickamauga to Point Park atop Lookout, 16 miles to Sherman's Reservation on Missionary. Point Park at the north end of Lookout, overlooking the magnificent sweep of the Tennessee River's Moccasin Bend, is where Gen. Joseph Hooker's men finally raised the Stars and Stripes in victory. Cars are not permitted in the park but visitors can park outside the gates, and a tour on foot takes an hour or two. It and 2,600 acres of slopes on either side are Federally preserved. The rest of Lookout is tightly controlled.    Missionary Ridge, directly across the horizon to the east, is virtually private domain, with a few slivers of land of historic importance under Federal control: for instance, Bragg's Reservation, where Bragg watched in horror as Thomas's blue-clads scaled the heights against all odds and sent the Confederates reeling, and Sherman's Reservation at the north end where lion-hearted, Irish-born Pat Cleburne held off Sherman's troops until the Rebels could retreat and avert a catastrophe. Quite a few of the private homes on Crest Drive, which runs along the top of Missionary Ridge, display cannons and historic markers in front yards.   A lighter, more carefree spirit seems to emanate from Lookout than from Chickamauga, as well as more contraptions and commerce. At the base of Lookout Mountain is something called the Confederama, an electric map housed in a pseudo-castle structure. The huge map of the battle is a useful aid to understanding it. The Incline Railway, originally built in 1895, runs up and down steep Lookout in a few minutes. (Round trip $5; children $3). On a clear day the view from Lookout is bracing and far-reaching (into Tennessee and Georgia) and a fine appreciation is soon reached, looking down the near-precipice slope, of the obstacles Hooker's men must have faced in their successful assault coming up. The battle of Lookout Mountain is often called \\"The Battle in the Clouds\\" because fog wreathed the mountain.    The idea of preserving the Chickamauga battlefield began at a barbecue for Union and Confederate veterans at Crawfish Springs, Ga. (now simply known as Chickamauga) on Sept. 20, 1889. Fourteen thousand veterans of both sides showed up. On 10 acres 30 tables were set up, each 250 feet in length. The veterans ate 12,000 pounds of meat, 12,000 loaves of bread, 300 pounds of butter, 65 pounds of pepper, and 1,200 pounds of salt. After the repast they smoked peace pipes made from wood taken from Snodgrass Hill. The former Confederate general, John B. Gordon, spoke -- and then came the former Union general, Rosecrans. They called each other comrade and embraced. Spontaneously the veterans lifted the two generals up in the middle of the center table and a band struck up \\"Dixie.\\" There followed a Rebel yell. President Benjamin Harrison, himself a veteran of the war, signed legislation making Chickamauga officially a park on Aug. 19, 1890.  Food and lodging near the site Restaurants   A visitor at the following Chattanooga tables may find himself in conversation with descendants of those who fought in local Civil War battles.   For local color try Rickey's (2603 Fourth Avenue; 615-622-9234), a family-run \\"meat-and-three\\" (vegetables) serving lunch plates for around $10 for two from 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Monday through Friday. Jessie Muse has made the restaurant's famous pies for more than 40 years, with a whole coconut pie priced to go at $6.60.    The River Inn restaurant (Suck Creek Road; 615-886-1864) serves catfish, the regional specialty, alongside the Tennessee River and occasionally to the tunes of blue-grass musicians; there is a fireplace in winter and a deck in summer. Dinner for two is about $30. Open Tuesday to Thursday 3 to 9:30 P.M. and Friday to Sunday noon to 10:30.  Call for directions by car or boat.    La Cabriole (134 Burgess Road; 615-821-0350) is the creation of a globe-trotting Algerian, Jacques Charton, who serves up to 45 people each Friday and Saturday night for a fixed $25 a person. He runs the \\"French-French, not French-American\\" restaurant out of his house on his horse farm just outside Chattanooga. Reservations required.  Papa's Riverview Restaurant (1101 Hixson Pike; 615-756-8700) serves Continental fare with favorites of veal and pasta; dinner for two runs around $60. The restaurant is in a renovated wood and brick theater.   Mount Vernon Restaurant (3509 Broad Street; 615-266-6591) is a self-styled \\"experience in Southern dining\\" popular with Chattanooga families; fresh vegetables and homebaked breads. Dinner for two runs $25. Open Mondays through Fridays 11 A.M. to 10 P.M. and Saturdays 5 P.M. to 10 P.M. Hotels   Downtown Chattanooga retains something of an Old South aura. Among the hotels are:    The Chattanoga Choo-Choo (1400 Market Street; 800-872-2529 or 615-266-5000) features Pullman Cars renovated to turn-of-the-century authenticity down to their 30-gallon hot water tanks. Now operated by Holiday Inn, double rooms are $105.   The Radisson Read House (827 Broad Street; 800-333-3333 or 615-266-4121) began as the Crutchfield House across from Union Station in 1847, served as a Civil War hospital to both Confederate and Union troops and was opened again as a hotel in 1872 by Dr. John T. Read. Old suites with Victorian furniture start at $79, and doubles in the newer part at $58.   The Chattanooga Marriott (2 Carter Plaza; 800-228-9290 or 615-756-0002) offers standard accommodations connected to the Chattanooga Convention and Trade Center, with doubles starting at $98.

This kind of communication has to do only partly with vocal quality and technique, although it undoubtedly helps to begin with an attractive sound and to know how to use it. The magic, though, is in discovering the chemistry between the poet and the composer and then adding the personal resonance that makes the singer seem an indispensable part of the amalgam.    Miss Fleming achieved that in several of the songs she offered. In Brahms's \\"Lerchengesang,\\" her smooth, slightly dark, gracefully weighted tone was ideal for the mystical imagery of Carl Candidus's text, and there was artfulness and subtlety in the way she shaped the lines, particularly ascending figures that tapered to a sweetly produced pianissimo.

He also hurt his elbow, leaving the second half to Steve DeBerg.   But, in a scenario that became common for the Broncos that season and the next, the defense bailed them out, intercepting three of Cliff Stoudt's passes and recovering four fumbles as the Broncos won, 14-10.   More bad memories: The next time the teams met, in a divisional playoff game last season in Denver, Elway threw a pass that was intercepted late in the game and set up the winning touchdown. The Steelers won, 24-17, to advance to the conference championship game. So much for history. Now, even though Elway may have established himself as one of the National Football League's better young quarterbacks, playing in Pittsburgh won't be any easier.

The Los Angeles Lakers are the only other franchise to make the playoffs that many times during that 22-year period.    Once in the playoffs, the Lakers have gone on to win six N.B.A. championships","excerpt":"the Bucks have won only one (1971), and two conference crowns and 12 divisional titles. Despite their success in making the playoffs year after year, the Bucks have received little national recognition.     Before the start of every season, it seems, the conclusion drawn after studying Milwaukee's roster and those of the other Central Division teams is that the Bucks are \\"too old, too small or too injured.\\" Invariably, the preseason predictions are that the Bucks will drop out of the league's higher echelon of teams.    The consensus this season was for the Bucks to finish just ahead of the Charlotte Hornets in the seven-team Central Division.    All of which was enough to upset Jay Humphries, the Bucks' co-captain.   \\"No one shows us any respect,\\" Humphries said on Wednesday night after the Bucks handed the Atlanta Hawks their sixth straight loss, 105-93. \\"I think that by now they should have learned. It's getting so that I no longer pay any attention to preseason ratings.\\"    If the Bucks can stay healthy, early indications are that they will not only make the playoffs for a 12th straight season, but they will make it as a 50-victory team.    Much like the Detroit Pistons, and now the Portland Trail Blazers, the bulk of Milwaukee's scoring comes from a three-guard offense of Ricky Pierce, voted the N.B.A.'s best sixth man last season, Alvin Robertson and Humphries. They have combined for an average of 54.3 points a game.    During the off season, the Bucks needed to get bigger and become a better rebounding team.   \\"We had to get stronger up front,\\" Coach Del Harris said. \\"There were times we were rebounding by a wish.\\"    They did it with two trades. They got the 6-foot-11-inch Danny Schayes from the Denver Nuggets for the draft rights to Terry Mills, and picked up the 6-10 Frank Brickowski from the San Antonio Spurs for Paul Pressey.    On Wednesday night, the Bucks managed to outrebound the Hawks, who are considered a good rebounding team, 63-44. Tomorrow afternoon, the Bucks will oppose the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Celtics Go With Tradition     Coaches change in Boston but not the tradition of the sixth man, which began in the 1960's with Frank Ramsay.    Chris Ford, the new Celtic coach, began the season by starting either Ed Pinckney or Michael Smith at power forward so that he could bring Kevin McHale off the bench. With neither Pinckney nor Smith producing to his liking, Ford made another switch. He moved Larry Bird from the small to big forward four games ago and put Kevin Gamble into Bird's spot. And when McHale and Bird are in the game together, Bird returns to small forward.    The Celtics (8-2), leaders in the Atlantic Division, haven't lost since the change, and Bird, who will be 34 years old on Dec. 7, doesn't have to chase after the quicker, high-scoring small forwards as much.  Bird Nearing Milestone     Bird is 71 points short of scoring his 20,000th career point. In doing so, he would become only the fifth player in N.B.A. history to have scored that many points in addition to piling up 5,000 assists.    The others who have accomplished the feat are Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,327 points and 5,660 assists), John Havlicek (26,387 and 6,114), Oscar Robertson (26,710 and 9,887) and Jerry West (25,192 and 6,238).  Inseparable Pair     No matter where Billy Thompson, the Miami Heat small forward, is playing, Milt Wagner won't be far behind. They played together at Camden, N.J., High School from 1979 to 1982, leading a team that averaged 105 points a game and taking it to the No. 1 ranking in the nation during their senior year. They played together at Louisville, which won the national championship in 1986. And they were reunited on the 1988 Lakers, who won the N.B.A. title.    When the Miami Heat came into the league last season, they selected Thompson in the expansion draft. This season, they added Wagner, a guard, who was signed as a free agent. Nuggets Cooling a Bit     Have you noticed that the new, run-and-shoot Denver Nuggets have begun to cool off some? After having averaged 138 points through their first six games, the Nuggets have scored 129, 121, 112 and 121 in their last four games, three of them losses. . . . After watching the San Antonio Spurs beat the Nuggets, 161-153, George Gervin, a four-time N.B.A. scoring champion, told friends, \\"I would have come out of retirement for that one.\\" . . . A contributing factor to the Chicago Bulls' poor 5-5 start may be the poor shooting by Scottie Pippen. His shooting percentage increased in each of his three pro seasons from a low of 46 percent in his rookie season to a high of .489 last season. This season, he is struggling at 42 percent.

Renowned for his musical unpredictability and cluster bombs of notes played at numbing decibels, Mr. Guy was considered too wild and overamplified for the owners of Chicago's Chess Records. Consequently, he was either used as a sideman for blues elders like Muddy Waters or toned down for his solo recordings. Until the album \\"Stone Crazy\\" was released in 1981, Mr. Guy was considered a great live act -- he played the guitar with his teeth and behind his back years before Jimi Hendrix -- who couldn't be captured on record. Today, however, all that has changed. Mr. Guy is a Grammy Award winner, and his album \\"Damn Right I've Got the Blues\\" is considered a blues milestone. The book of the same name, DAMN RIGHT I'VE GOT THE BLUES: Buddy Guy and the Blues Roots of Rock-and-Roll (Woodford Press, 660 Market Street, Suite 206, San Francisco, Calif. 94104, paper, $14.95), an oral biography written by the music journalist Donald E. Wilcock with the guitarist's cooperation, is a frank assessment of the life, many disappointments and rare hurrahs of Buddy Guy. Suffering from lingering insecurities about his own abilities, Mr. Guy even today insists there are dozens of musicians who can play better than he does. At the end of this slim volume he tells of buying his son a guitar so that he could learn to play like Prince. Mr. Guy recommended that the young man also listen to Jimi Hendrix. After watching a film clip of Hendrix, the son called his father and said: \\"He said he learned from you.

Economic Scene","excerpt":"The Budget's Many Facets"},{"year":"1991","title":"President Bush's new budget proposes to take about $15 billion worth of Federal programs, abolish them and turn the money over to the states. It's an old and seductive idea, and the nation's governors, hard pressed for cash, are understandably enthusiastic.   The governors are fooling themselves. Unless radically revised, the plan deserves swift burial. It threatens the poor. It won't help struggling cities. And despite the flowery Budget Message rhetoric, it does little to serve the cause of federalism.    The idea of decentralizing Federal programs has an honorable pedigree. Partly in reaction to the vast array of categorical grant programs passed under Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, every President since has tried to group programs more rationally, in so-called block grants, and by other means transfer more operational authority to states and cities.   The purposes have been for the most part laudable: Move Federal funds closer to the people, cut overhead costs, give states greater spending flexibility and encourage innovation. President Nixon, who called the idea \\"the New Federalism,\\" consolidated related programs in areas like job training and community development. He also persuaded Congress to enact a $7 billion program of general revenue sharing, money the states could use for almost any purpose.    President Reagan had even more ambitious plans for devolving power, but they were thwarted for two reasons. He promised states more control but less money -- as the governors and Congress swiftly detected. And he stumbled over Congress's reluctance to let states and cities win credit for spending the money that Congress raises.    Mr. Bush also speaks grandly about returning more power to the people. But on inspection, his plan would merely give more power to the governors. Unlike Mr. Nixon, Mr. Bush is not talking about consolidating related programs. The governors would select $15 billion from a list of unrelated programs totaling $20.9 billion. The $15 billion would then be tossed into a giant block grant.    That might be acceptable if the plan required states to spend the money for essentially the same purposes served by the programs scheduled for abolition. But it does not","excerpt":"the budgetary language is so vague that a governor could theoretically take money originally earmarked for literacy and spend it on waste disposal.   That's ominous because four-fifths of the programs on the \\"hit list\\" serve the poor -- $3 billion for low-income housing, for example; $2.8 billion for social services; $5.1 billion for administering programs like Medicaid and welfare. The risk is that hard-pressed governors might be tempted to divert funds to other programs favored by constituencies more powerful than the poor.    There's also a money problem. Richard Darman, the budget director, pledges that the $15 billion figure will be maintained for five years. What then? Leon Panetta, chairman of the House Budget Committee, warns that political support for the individual programs will inevitably decline once they're lumped together.    But the largest failure in Mr. Bush's idea is that he has missed a chance to redefine the division of labor between the states and Washington. And that would be to ask Washington to pick up a far larger share of the cost of expensive    national    problems like Medicaid and welfare. In exchange, states and cities would take more responsibility for services best managed locally, like transportation, job training and education.   Such a plan would at least force Congress to think seriously about the problems that have piled up on the nation's agenda for 10 years.

What do you know about the life and work of Sacheverell Mongoose, to whom the 1978 A.I.A. Guide to New York City attributes the rowhouses at the northwest corner of 84th Street and Madison Avenue? . . . Prof. David Bady, director, the City and the Humanities Program, City University of New York.     A. The late Elliott Willensky, co-author of the guide, said about 10 years ago that the name was a fiction, inserted in the second edition to catch those who pirated its research -- of whom there were many.    In fact, this unusual row of buildings was designed in 1891 by John H. Duncan, who had won the competition for Grant's Tomb three years before. These houses seem to combine elements of Greek, prairie and Renaissance styling. There were originally six houses with an apartment house at the north end of the row. In 1977 the Landmarks Preservation Commission proposed a Metropolitan Museum Historic District that included all six houses, but the northern three were exempted from designation because a developer, John J. Avlon, protested. About eight years later they were replaced by the present apartment tower at 30 East 85th Street.   The current edition of the A.I.A. Guide correctly credits the remaining houses. No one seems to have appropriated the misleading Mongoose attribution. The 'Chateau' on West End    Q.    What is the unusual building on the west side of West End Avenue, between 72d and 73d Streets? It looks like a chateau, but has been very changed at the top. . . . Richard Giglio, Manhattan.     A. The limestone town house at 266 West End Avenue was built in 1896 for the family of Julius N. Jaros, an importer who occupied it only through 1906.   It appears that the peaked tile roof was removed to add a modernistic fifth floor in a 1944 alteration by the architect Harry Hurwit. By that time it had already been converted into a multiple dwelling. York Avenue History    Q.    My family owned a building at 1335 York Avenue for 100 years beginning in the 1860's. When was it built? . . . Charlotte Healy Whalen, Massapequa, L.I.     A. William Glass bought the land in 1868 and the two-story brick house shows up on yearly property tax records for the first time in 1869, suggesting that your family may have built it. But no Glasses occupied the house until 1883, when the widowed Margaret Glass is first listed there.    The 1890 census records 13 occupants at that address: Margaret Glass and two children, five members of the Varcasia family and five members of the Bissinger family. Some of these probably occupied a building that stood at the rear of the lot. A 1940 photograph shows the house with an awning reading Healy's Dining Room. The Glass family -- by this time including Healy relatives -- sold the building to make way for the Mary Manning Walsh Home in 1966.  East 87th Brownstones    Q.    The south side of my block, East 87th Street between York and East End Avenues, is built up with brownstones, the north side with small apartment houses. I have heard the plan was for the poorer people on the north side to serve the richer people on the south side. True? . . . Howard Davis, Manhattan.     A. The brownstone rowhouses on the south side were all built between 1871 and 1875","excerpt":"the buildings on the north side were built in 1891 to 1893 as \\"flats\\" -- midway between tenements and luxury apartment houses. All were built by different groups of professional developers and it is unlikely that there was any link between the two building episodes: The ideal of the 19th-century private householder was to live on a street restricted to like dwellings.    The shift in developers' choices in what to build also represents a change in the housing market in the area. After the Civil War, Beekman Place, Sutton Place and East End Avenue were attractive locales for rowhouse construction. But towards the end of the century they declined, in part because of the increasing age of their housing stock, in part because of the industrialization of such waterfront areas. Land for flat and tenement construction usually brought lower prices than land suitable for private house construction. During the revival of these areas after World War I the most attractive were those with a large existing private house stock. Mount Morris Sanitorium    Q.    I was born in Harlem in the \\"Mount Morris Park Sanitorium\\" on Aug. 26, 1925. Where was it? . . . Janice Stern, West Hartford, Conn.     A. The seven-story building was built in 1923 at the southwest corner of 121st Street and Mount Morris Park West (now Nathan L. Davis Place) by Hermann Reichmann, whose \\"Hydropathic Institute\\" was across the park on Madison Avenue.

Economic Spotlight","excerpt":"The bulls outnumbered the bears at the yearend."},{"year":"1996","title":"Michael Jordan is not sure how to answer this one. If he says yes, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird might differ. If he says no, he is backing down. \\"Are we the greatest team of all time?\\" muses the Chicago Bulls' supernova guard. \\"Well . . . \\" How can anyone be sure after this championship series, when it is no longer Bulls versus SuperSonics, but rather Jordan and his teammates against National Basketball Association history. As Chicago looked to close out the finals with Seattle in Game 4 on Wednesday night at Key Arena, the overriding theme was not what little chance the Sonics had but how Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and the hired help would be construed next to the league's other great teams. The Lakers always had the Celtics for six or seven games to measure themselves by. The Bulls of the early 90's had the Pistons and the Knicks. Ali had Frazier. Martina had Chrissie. These Bulls have . . . these Bulls. Either they're simply too polished to have their greatness quantified or no one  will ever know how good they are because they were never tested. They beat the rickety Knicks in five games, swept away some big kids in mouse ears from Orlando in four games and are on the brink of removing Seattle's voicebox, also  in four. The last playground war they took part in came three weekends ago in New York, where a split at Madison Square Garden became the only blemish on their 14-1 post-season record. \\"The fact that there is no comparison says it all,\\" Pippen said. \\"And that is: We're the greatest team of all time. That's my opinion.\\" It is one shared by many outside of the organization. With Nate McMillan doubtful with a strained back for Game 4 and the squawking of Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp surpassing their play, the Sonics will become the second 60-victory team to be eliminated by Chicago in four games en route to a title. Only one other team in N.B.A. annals has accomplished that feat: the Bulls of 1993, who beat the Knicks (60 victories) and the Suns (62). A sweep would also mean a 15-1 post-season mark, the best during a championship run. But, really, aside from the Knicks, there were no decent scrums, no great test in the post-season for this collection of basketball players who won a league-record 72 games during the regular season. \\"That's not the Bulls' fault,\\" said Bill Walton, the NBC analyst who played on the 1986 Celtic team that is considered among the league's best. \\"That's everyone else's fault. They have no control over who they play.\\" Ron Harper, who did not start Game 3 because of a bruised knee, is expected to start in Game 4. Seattle Coach George Karl will sit down center Ervin Johnson in favor of Sam Perkins or Frank Brickowski, going with either more offense and physical play. In other developments today, Phil Jackson, who is essentially cashing in his last bargaining chip on Wednesday, made it clear he is not opposed to taking a year's sabbatical instead of returning to coaching next season. He did not rule out coaching in Europe or taking a job as an announcer for a year, like Pat Riley did in between coaching the Lakers and the Knicks, or merely retreating to Montana to mellow out. The options, of course, become more  diverse -- Jackson has yet to mention becoming a parasailing instructor -- the longer the Bulls wait to sign their free-agent coach to a short-term deal that would not be insulting, one for John Calipari and Riley money. Meanwhile, between diatribes on how great this Bulls team is compared with how great those other Bulls teams were, Jordan decided that \\"great\\" was being thrown around a little too freely, considering Game 4 had not yet begun. \\"We can taste it,\\" Jordan said. \\"It's definitely there. But we still have one hurdle to go over. Sometimes that last hurdle is taller than all the others when you get to the end.\\" Jordan, who has said he only wants to play with Jackson as his coach, went on to say that as loyal as he is, he will only go so far. \\"Tell Phil I'm not going to Montana,\\" he said, with a mischievous smile. Neither the coach nor the star player of perhaps the greatest team in league history mentioned an eventual trip to Springfield, Mass.

Again, under the most difficult of conditions, she completed her dental and medical degrees, graduating from the University of Munich with highest honors. In 1951, she arrived in New York and interned at Greenpoint Hospital, Brooklyn. She completed her residency in psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital. For the next almost four decades, she worked as a staff psychiatrist for the Catholic Charities Guidance Institute","excerpt":"the Bureau of Child Guidance, NYC Board of Education, Psychiatrist, Family Court, NYC; and as a psychoanalyst for the American Institute of Psychoanalysis as well as the Karen Horney Clinic. She was a Fellow of the American Geriatrics Society and of the American Acadmy of Psychoanalysis. Her memberships included the AMA; American Psychiatric Association, Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis, the New York Council of Child Psychiatry and the Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy. Her commitment to Latvia was reflected in her ever generous support of Latvian organizations and philanthropies in the diaspora. Since 1991, her great energies were directed to supporting educational endeavors in the newly free Latvian Republic. A deep religiosity informed her life and work. She is survived by cousins in Latvia, her beloved godson Mikelis Svilans (Ottawa, Canada) and many, many friends. She is lovingly remembered by Dr. Rita D'Angelo and Dr. Astrida I.

Scott Fitzgerald was an embittered man during the last days of his life, he was deeply involved in writing \\"The Last Tycoon.\\" It was, of course, that unfinished novel and not his patchwork career as a screenwriter that became his Hollywood legacy. Fitzgerald's travail in the movies and how it eventually fed his artistry would seem to provide a rich subject for dramatization. Sadly, John Kane's monodrama, \\"The Other Side of Paradise,\\" is misguided and superficial.   The play, which opened last night at the Kaufman Theater, reduces Fitzgerald to a burned-out egotist who has lost his adrenalin along with his wit. Loosely stitching together anecdotes from fact and legend, Mr. Kane puts everything into the mouth of the author, who alternately talks to himself and chats awkwardly with the audience. Occasionally there is an evocative story, but nothing the character says or does on stage persuades us that he could have written any of his books. The discredit for the show is shared by the playwright and the actor Keir Dullea, who has rashly decided to go it alone in this slapdash vehicle. Review/Theater","excerpt":"The Burned-Out Days Of F.

John Mason Cooney succumbed to cancer on June 13, 2005. He was 71 years old. This brought to a close a life devoted to education and community service, including 30 years of distinguished service at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. Cooney was born in 1933 and raised in McDowell County, West Virginia, where his father and grandfather were involved in the coal industry. Graduating from Elkhorn High School as class president, he continued his education in 1952 at the McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, one of the nation's top college preparatory schools. Cooney obtained his bachelor's degree from Marshall University in 1956, studying philosophy and Greek. He then attended Princeton Theological Seminary from 1956-1958 and transferred to Harvard University, where he received his divinity degree (theology) in 1959. In 1962, he completed credits for his doctoral degree in political science at Rutgers University. Cooney's early professional years were spent in the church. He served as minister of the Fairmount Presbyterian Church in Califon, New Jersey, from 1959-1966. He was a member of Newton Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church (honorably retired). Cooney was the organizing chairman of the Northwest New Jersey Community Action Program, the antipoverty agency still serving Hunterdon, Warren, and Sussex counties. He then worked for New Jersey Governors Hughes and Cahill in the Department of Community Affairs, in the areas of education and youth. Among his many duties, he served Governor Cahill as staff director for the White House Conference on Children and Youth (1969-1972), assembling and directing the New Jersey committee that included, among others, future New Jersey Governor and 9/ 11 Commission Chair Thomas Kean. In 1972, Cooney began work representing Rutgers University in the local community and as a liaison to the state government, local government and community organizations, and coordinating visits of national and world dignitaries while serving Rutgers University President Edward J. Bloustein. He continued to serve in that role under Bloustein's successor, Francis L. Lawrence. Cooney retired from that position in 2002. At Rutgers, Cooney administered programs that brought distinguished visitors to the institution: the Victoria Program in Contemporary Issues, the Clifford P. Case Fellowship Program, Senator Bill Bradley student programs, and the Holland Program on Ethics in Government. Among the visitors were former Presidents Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton, former Speaker of the House Thomas Tip-O'Neill, and former Vice President Walter Mondale. He coordinated the royal visits of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and the Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan. Cooney also administered the University's Kirkpatrick Chapel for many years. He established the first day care program for the children of faculty, staff and community residents. The Senior Citizen Audit Program was administered by his office. Cooney held leadership positions in a number of community agencies, including the United Way of Central New Jersey, serving as its President and on its Board of Directors. His office at Rutgers was also responsible for organizing and directing the University's annual drive for its combinedcharities campaign. He served on the boards of: the Raritan-Millstone Heritage Alliance","excerpt":"the Business and Education Partnership of Somerset/Hunterdon counties; the New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Blindness; the New Jersey Teen Arts Festival; New Jersey Special Olympics, the Boonton Hospice; and the Friends of New Jersey Public Television as president from 1968-1972.
