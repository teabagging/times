Now I said, \\"Got to go, huh?\\" And they said, \\"The polls have spoken. America can't stand her.\\"   If you want to be President -- and wow! Do I ever want to be President! -- you must obey your handlers. \\"Changing her name from Flossie to Emily,\\" I asked, \\"didn't help her polls?\\"    In fact, said my handler, dropping the Flossie had cost her four points among over-60 voters. They were old enough to remember when people had mothers named Flossie. They thought my wife's switch to Emily was an insult to motherhood.   \\"I hate it, my wife having to go,\\" I told my handlers, who scowled at me, no doubt thinking I didn't have fire in the belly. So I said to them, I said: \\"Just kidding, guys. You say the wife's got to go, she goes. As far as I'm concerned it's 'So long, Flossie, it's been good to know you.' Because, wow! Do I ever want to be President!\\"    You've got to handle handlers with a velvet touch or they'll quit handling you, then what have you got? Catastrophe unmitigated: ex-handlers telling the media buzzards you don't want it bad enough, don't have any fire in the esophagus, much less the belly, and a guy who won't obey his handlers, what kind of President would he make anyhow? America's lucky your handlers found out what a wimp you were before they started marketing you.   My good old Mom -- bless her even though she's still lost back there in the Arthur Godfrey age -- she was shocked when I first brought my handlers home to shape her up.    \\"Did you say they're handlers, Bub? You need handlers?\\"    \\"Can't be President nowadays without handlers, Mom.\\"   \\"You're spoofing good old Mom, aren't you, Bub? Elephants have handlers. Giraffes, camels, zoo creatures, they have handlers. Don't you have any more brains than a poor caged beast, Bub?\\"   The handlers told me to tell Mom to button her lip and go to makeup, then to ghostwriting where my wordsmiths would fit her out with a new biography which my speech teachers would train her to emit in seven-second but heartbreakingly touching sound bites. \\"And tell her to keep it buttoned until we assign her a full-time lip handler.\\"    So I said, \\"Keep your lip buttoned, Mom, because -- wow! Do I ever want to be President!\\"   Mom's lip handler has her under control now, so she's quit telling every TV buzzard who rams a camera up her nose that her son hasn't got any more brains than a caged giraffe.    She was so excited about a crack at the First Mother job that she didn't scream when my handlers told her she'd have to change her name from Peaches to Rose Marie. They're hoping to get a bump in the blue-rinse-and-rheumatism vote by spreading enough payola to bring back Nelson Eddy's recording of \\"Rose Marie, I Love You.\\"   My wife is not so cooperative, however. What a big deal she made of changing her name from Flossie. It was like she didn't have any fire at all in the belly. Then all that whining about giving up her partnership in Asham, Masham, Sushi & Kaminsky. My handlers were nice to her, too. Explained it so clearly.   \\"Flossie,\\" they said, \\"the polls show Americans hate to see a wife pulling down multimillion-dollar bonuses from investment banking when she can't even cook macaroni and cheese.\\"    \\"You mean I've got to quit being Flossie, drop out of this merger deal with Consolidated and Systemics Galore, and sit home cooking macaroni and cheese?\\" she threatened. She did what was right, though, after I gave it to her straight from the shoulder.   \\"Flossie,\\" said I, \\"in me you see a man who never admired George Bush so much as on the day he said, 'I will do what I have to do to be re-elected.' \\"   \\"You want it that much?\\"   \\"Wow!\\" I explained. \\"Do I ever want to be President!\\"   Now, though, my handlers were saying it hadn't worked. Not even the macaroni and cheese. She had to go.  \\"Where?\\" I asked.

Foreword by Robert M. Coles.  333 pp. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co. $14.95.   ''IS THERE NO PLACE ON EARTH FOR ME?'' is the compelling, mordantly funny story of Sylvia Frumkin (the name is a pseudonym","excerpt":"the person is real), a diagnosed and deteriorating schizophrenic. The title repeats the question that Sylvia first asked her mother when she was 15 years old and in the process of being transferred from a private psychiatric facility to a state-run hospital. ''It was a question,'' writes author Susan Sheehan, ''that Sylvia asked her mother dozens of times over the next seventeen years.'' The answer, one would have to infer from the desperate tale told here, is ''No place on earth but Creedmoor,'' the depressing, understaffed mental hospital located in Queens Village, N. Y. For Sylvia Frumkin, now in her early 30's, has grown into schizophrenia rather than into her own independent adult existence; no one knows where she does belong during those periods when she isn't frankly psychotic. Each path that she begins to tread, each new effort to get well and to get on with her life, leads her, with iron inevitability, back to craziness and to Creedmoor.

Like it or not, that's  the way we think and talk in a sexually sophisticated society. But as  graphically as Ms. Cho describes kinky sexual experiments, she is not interested in shock for shock's sake or even in titillation. The movie, directed and edited by Lorene Machado and taped in Seattle before a largely gay and lesbian audience, is really about personal liberation.

Like its predecessor, ''The Wake of Jamey Foster'' is about a batty, small-town Mississippi family drawn together by grief. In the new play, the occasion for the gathering is the death of the title character, an alcoholic dreamer about whom even his widow (Susan Kingsley) had ''mixed emotions.''

It's easy to figure out why -- money. America's foreign arms sales topped $31 billion in 1993, and conventional wisdom holds that these exports are simply too good to pass up, regardless of the moral, political and strategic concerns they raise.\\n\\nBut the conventional wisdom is wrong. A study by the World Policy Institute reveals that when public and private subsidies and indirect costs are included, arms exports may actually harm the American economy -- notwithstanding the $31 billion. Four major factors are involved:\\n\\n* Taxpayer Subsidies. The Federal Government spends more than $7 billion a year on arms exports. The sum includes loans and grants that directly or indirectly finance weapons sales, the salaries of the thousands of Government workers who assist in those sales, and promotional activities. The Pentagon alone annually spends more than $300 million for an arms export staff of 5,000 employees as well as $25 million on trade shows.\\n\\n\\n* The Cost of Offsets. In most major arms sales, American companies enter into \\"offset\\" agreements to steer to the purchasing country business worth anywhere from 50 percent to 100 percent of the sale value. Offsets frequently mean taking business from American companies and giving it to foreign suppliers -- thus drastically reducing the sales' benefits to our economy. In a $3 billion sale of fighter aircraft to Finland in 1992, for example, the Northrop Corporation agreed to help send $2 billion in business to Finnish companies.\\n\\n\\n* Threat Creation. American arms sales contribute to regional arms races, which in turn fuel higher Pentagon spending to deal with these greater threats to our security. In 1992, the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency, estimated that the United States could save $10 billion or more on defense if weapons imports into the Mideast were curtailed. Given those numbers and the common military view that a potential conflict in Asia poses a big threat to American security, a similar curtailment in that region would also save billions of dollars. \\n\\n\\n* Stunted Markets. When developing nations import armaments, their economies grow more slowly and their markets for nonmilitary exports are smaller. A recent study by the International Monetary Fund estimated that a 20 percent reduction in worldwide military spending could generate $190 billion in new markets for consumer products -- nearly four times the revenue of the international arms market. \\n\\n\\nEven ignoring the moral and strategic problems of arms sales -- something many will decline to do -- their economic benefits are greatly exaggerated. When taxpayer subsidies and corporate offsets are subtracted, the net benefits to the American economy amount at most to a few billion dollars each year. And when the added military costs and the dampening effect on foreign markets are included, the sales may actually hurt the economy.\\n\\nBUT the Administration doesn't see things that way. A year ago, it promised to try to curb the flow of weapons to regions of conflict. But nothing has yet happened, and the Administration's proposed budget for fiscal 1995 will provide substantial subsidies for arms exports.\\n\\nThis inaction is easy to explain. While foreign arms sales make no large economic sense, they are lucrative for the companies and communities involved. The Administration, busy with other issues, fears any restrictions will provoke a harsh political backlash by the arms industry.\\n\\nThus, if arms trading is to be reduced, Congress and the public must do it. A good place to start -- and one that jibes with deficit reduction -- is to cut back on the billions of dollars in arms export subsidies in the proposed 1995 Federal budget. A second reform is to legislate strict limits on offset arrangements.

The contributions that he and his beloved wife, Dr. Muriel Berman, both members of the University's Board of Governors, have made over the years will benefit many generations of scholars and researchers in a number of important areas, including medicine, archaeology, and the arts. Among their many important contributions are: The Philip I. and Muriel M. Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology","excerpt":"The Philip I. and Muriel M. Berman National Medical Library, one of the most modern and efficient medical libraries in the world and a center for biocommunications for all of Israel; an apartment home for nurses at the Hadassah - Hebrew University complex at Ein Kerem; a 350-seat auditorium at the Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus; the Berman Computer for the University's Index of Jewish Art; and the Muriel M. and Philip I. Berman Scholarship and Fellowship Program, which provides fellowships for advanced overseas studies, teaching fellowships, merit scholarships and visiting professorships. In addition, several important works of art donated by the Bermans grace the University's campuses, reminding all who walk by of their generosity and superb taste. Philip and Muriel Berman received honorary doctorate degrees from the University, and were awarded the Scopus Award, the highest honor that the American Friends can confer. Philip was a role model to all. We want to express our deepest sympathies to his wife, Muriel, their three children, Nancy Berman Bloch, Nina Sheafer, and Steven Berman, their six grandchildren and extended family.

A new building designed by Cesar Pelli, the architect and former dean of the Yale School of Architecture, is to be built on the campus, with money to be raised by the Friends of Music at Yale.    The first event in the campaign is a concert scheduled for 5 P.M. today in Battell Chapel, featuring William F. Buckley Jr. as harpsichordist in a performance of Bach's \\"Chromatic Fantasy\\" and \\"Concerto in F Minor.\\" Mr. Buckley will also serve as narrator for Saint-Saens's \\"Carnival of the Animals,\\" accompanied by the Yale Symphony Chamber Players under the direction of James Ross.    Mr. Buckley noted that \\"nobody in the history of the world has attacked the F Minor Concerto of Bach as I have done, extruding my exiguous musical resources with the kind of care you would take with a quart of water embarking in a life raft across the ocean.\\" The author, editor, television personality, political conservative and Yale alumnus suggested that Democrats be charged more for admission than Republicans, but the idea was dropped for possible unconstitutionality.    Tickets are $10, students tickets are $5, and patron tickets, which include a post-performance reception with the artists, are $35. Battell Chapel is on the Yale campus at the corner of College and Elm Streets in New Haven.

Her script will be enhanced by excerpts from Tchaikovsky's music played by Dorothy Happel, violinist, and Lowell Lacey, pianist.    Tchaikovsky and von Meck never met face to face, but they exchanged deeply personal letters for 14 years.  Mme. von Meck supplied Tchaikovsky with an annual allowance, permitting him to abandon teaching and devote himself to composing.   Tickets available at the door are $10, $5 for students.

Call 966-6668 for reservations or more information. CIRCUS POSTERS     Before television, the poster was the most publicly visible form of advertising, and it was used extensively by circuses, which often came to town for one night only and had to maximize publicity by plastering notices on every available wall. High-wire and animal acts, ringmasters, fire eaters and bareback riders were immortalized in wood or stone engravings.    The Barnum Museum in Bridgeport, named for P. T. Barnum, founder of the circus empire and a former Mayor of the city, features a permanent collection of circus memorabilia. Some of it, plus pieces on loan from the Big Apple Circus, the Henry Ford Museum, the New York State Museum and other museums, libraries and private collections, makes up a new exhibition opening Friday and running through April 14.    Called \\"The Circus is Coming! Advertising Art: Posters and Ephemera,\\" the display contains more than 100 items covering the past 200 years of circus activity in America and Europe.   In addition to posters, the show features tickets, handbills, lithographers' stones and tools and an area where children can make their own circus posters.    The museum's Victorian brownstone building at 820 Main Street, was reopened last year after an $8.5 million restoration that included a new wing, designed by Richard Meier, where the exhibition is on view. It is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M., and Sunday from noon to 4:30 P.M. Admission is $5, $4 for students and the elderly, $2 for children. Call 331-1104 for more information.

How can one find out if it is O.K. to bring goods made of crocodile or alligator into the United States from abroad? -- Randall-Scott Ross, New York, N.Y.     A.  Under the Endangered Species Act it is illegal to bring into the United States many products made from the skin of alligators, crocodiles or related reptiles called caimans. If brought into the United States, watchbands, shoes, purses, belts and other goods made from endangered species can be confiscated with no recompense to the owner. It is quite difficult to determine on your own which species an item is made of, and buyers must rely on the word of merchants that their goods may legally be brought back home.    Items made of American alligator -- generally exported from this country and then processed and often sold abroad -- are not endangered and may be brought into the United States, so long as they are for personal, not commercial, use. The skins of most crocodile species are prohibited. Of three species of caiman, which live in Central and South America, two are banned. One of these, Caiman crocodilus yacare, is often passed off as the common caiman, the species that is legal. Only an expert to tell the skins apart, a spokesman for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service said. Lizard-skin products originally from Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela and India, Nepal and Pakistan are banned, as are snakeskin products originating in Latin America and some Asian countries, including India, and all sea turtle products.   When a traveler arrives in the United States with an item made of reptile skin (or any other possibly endangered species like coral), Customs agents inspect the goods. Any questionable items are then inspected by a Fish and Wildlife agent, who may take the goods away either permanently or until it can be further examined by experts. Generally, forfeiture is the penalty for bringing in banned products, though repeat offenders, especially those trying to smuggle quantities of such goods, can be fined up to $25,000.   If you have an idea of what you want to buy, it is a good idea before leaving -- or even once abroad -- to call a Fish and Wildlife Service office","excerpt":"the phone number of the New York office is (718) 917-1705. The World Wildlife Fund, (202) 293-4800, also can supply information. However, these organizations warn, only inspection can determine the origin of a reptile or other creature. English Cottage Gardens    Q.     I am very interested in taking a tour of English cottage gardens. -- Jane Brook Barba, New York, N.Y.     A.  Few tours focus primarily on cottage gardens, informal groupings of massed flowers; the primary focus is hedged, manicured formal gardens most often seen by tourists. One tour, May 21 to June 1, offered by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, does include one cottage garden, Greatham Mill, surrounding a 17th-century mill near Winchester. Also included are a more formal gardens and entry to the Chelsea Flower Show in London. The cost is $5,218 a person in double occupancy, including air fare from New York, hotel and most meals. Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 1000 Washington Avenue, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11225; (718) 622-4433.   Anne Mazlish, who used to run a tour company specializing in British gardens, will consult, for $50 an hour, with groups or individuals who wish to arrange a garden tour. She can be contacted at 3 Channing Circle, Cambridge, Mass. 02138; (617) 354-1879.   To see cottage gardens exclusively, you may need to construct your own tour. To do so, a paperback book called \\"Gardens of England and Wales,\\" published by the National Gardens Scheme, will be helpful. The book describes private gardens that are open to the public, and when, and is considered the best source for cottage gardens.

A group of 10 of us plans to travel to Vienna, Prague, Berlin and Budapest. How can we go about hiring a small bus with a driver and guide? -- Vera Glaser, Washington     A.  In order to travel as you wish, you can call a company experienced in arranging travel in Eastern Europe and ask for the F.I.T. (for foreign independent travel) department. The company will know of vehicles and drivers in the places you want to visit. It will be difficult to find a guide knowledgable about all four cities, and fluent in all three languages, to acccompany you. The travel companies suggest hiring an English-speaking driver and arranging to have a different guide meet you in each city. The cost of the trip will vary greatly according to your arrangements; the companies contacted would not venture even a rough guess.   One money-saving suggestion was to rent a minibus out of Prague or Budapest and return it there at journey's end; renting out of Berlin would be more expensive, and out of Vienna more expensive yet. A company specializing in Eastern Europe, General Tours, reported difficulty in one such trip in finding parts for repairs to the bus and in finding gas stations that took the travelers' credit cards.    Here are two companies that say they will work with requests such as yours. Tour Designs, 510 H Street S.W., Washington, D.C. 20024; (800) 432-8687 or (202) 554-5820.

It is really very funny","excerpt":"the photographer has been kept on the alert with trick photography in the airplane exploits of Robert Street, which part is played effectively by Douglas McLean. Hence the Cameo, where this effort is being presented is a merry theatre this week, and the laughter almost drowns the work of the musicians.Lloyd Ingraham directed this film, the action of which is swift and without a tedious instant. Not only does McLean perform his rôle satisfactorily, but Hallam Cooley is very efficient as Street's friend, Hopkinson Brown. These two really get away from the ordinary motion-picture acting, and they seem quite natural, actually moved to mirth themselves by the story of the farce.As may be remembered, Street, a young author, makes a huge success out of his aviation book \\"Going Up,\\" never having soared in the air for a moment. His publisher, bent on selling the book, is keen for publicity, and he tricks Street into taking a ride in a flying machine, which abruptly returns to earth. Street sustains a very slight injury to his knee, of which he makes the most. Thereupon he has to give an excuse for his game leg at the White Mountains hotel, where he tells a pretty girl that he fell 15,000 feet, At the wrong moment Jules Gaillard, a French ace, alights from his airplane near the hotel. He is told that he must race Street. So the writer is forced into a flying machine, and the stunts he makes it perform, because he does not know how to handle the machine, cause the Frenchman to descend with the declaration that there is not enough room in the sky for the two machines and the umpiring blimp.When McLean is supposed to be in the air, one gets his view of the earth, an idea of the fear of the men in the blimp, and now and again the surprise of the Frenchman, who supposes Street to be a wonder with his airplane. Gaillard is thoroughly humiliated, as he had insisted that he was going to defeat Street as he \\"never was defeated before.\\"Eventually Street comes to grief with his machine, but when the fuselage is pulled away. Street is discovered still at the wheel, believing that the machine is still going. He had been through a railroad tunnel and narrowly missed a collision with a train, and was intensely relieved to discover himself actually on terra firma.Another ludicrous sequence is where a heavyweight flying teacher attempts to instruct Street on the eve of the contest. Here Street has a toothbrush in either side of his straw hat, and is seated on a chair on top of a wheel tea table, fascinated by steering the whole affair round and round the room, when Gaillard, the intrepid and scoffing one, enters. The mere sight of the Frenchman is enough to make Street's face pallid. This is a film which will appeal to everybody who wants a really good laugh.The Dempsey-Firpo fight pictures are also showing at the Cameo, as well as a clever satire on hunting big game.

When the Soviets decreed that all art was required to hew to the Socialist Realist line and carry the promise of the revolution to the masses, political leaders already had a sense that photography could do this particularly effectively. No  one needed an art education (or any other kind) to read photographs. The images were inherently credible, and photomontage provided a vivid means of combining fact and ideology: modern machinery dwarfed by heroic workers, happy masses presided over by gigantic Stalins or Lenins.         From 1930 to 1941, the Soviets exported unrelentingly good news about their revolution to Europe and beyond via a remarkable photographic magazine called U.S.S.R. in Construction. Published in Russian, English, French, German (and for a while in Spanish) editions, U.S.S.R. in Construction reported, or more precisely boasted, about the astonishing feat of compressing decades upon decades of technological development into a few short years. Almost overnight, a 19th-century nation was transformed into a 20th-century colossus. Never mind that the transformation cost the lives of millions it was meant to help","excerpt":"the photographs studiously ignored any such dirty business.    PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;From a Soviet Magazine That Made a Revolution Of Its Own in Design"},{"year":"1921","title":"William Vaughn Moody's \\"The Faith Healer,\\" done in motion pictures under the direction of George Melford, from a scenario by the playwright's widow and Z. Wall Covington, is the now photoplay at the Criterion Theatre. The fact that Mrs. Moody aided in the adaptation of her husband's play argues that the production is a generally faithful translation of its original, but, however this may be, the present fact is that Mr. Melford and his associates have made an unusually interesting photoplay—except, probably, for those who object to modern miracle stories.For \\"The Faith Healer\\" is unequivocally a miracle story. It has the courage of its convictions, anyhow. Like the genuine ghost story which scorns rational explanations of its phenomena, it makes no compromise. It meets the challenge that its miracles are merely the result of mental suggestion with a scene in which an infant dead in its mother's arms is restored to life. Those who choose to admit this as a fact, but offer the naturalistic explanation that the child was only in a state of coma are at liberty to do so, but the photoplay clearly rejects their attempt at rationalization, electing to stand or fall by its affirmation of the miraculous. So the spectator can take it or leave it, but he cannot accuse it of seeking to please everybody by the method of ambiguity. This, at least, is to its credit.As many who have seen or read the play know, the story is of a wandering evangelist who goes his religious way alone until he finds a woman for whom he develops a humanly physical love. His conscience troubles him then. He feels that his love is incompatible with spirituality and he loses his power of healing, until there comes to him the conviction that it is not his love, but his mistrust of love, that is disturbing him, and his miraculous power returns.Mr. Melford has succeeded in telling much of this story in kinetic photography. Occasionally effectiveness is lost through the weakness of expressionless scenes lamely explained by words, but there are other scenes which are tensely dramatic within themselves. In a number of its crises the photoplay, depending upon cinematography, becomes emotionally compelling.Many of the pictures are effectively composed","excerpt":"the photography is excellent, on the whole, and the settings are appropriate, though sometimes scenes are too crowded. The acting is generally good, and in some cases exceptional, Mlton Sills, as the healer, is suited to his part. He gives it the dignity and sincerity, with the blending of spirituality and materiality, required to make it convincing. His crooked smile now and then seems forced and unspiritual, but most of the time, especially when he is not too close to the camera, he is impressive. Ann Forrest, as the woman, is admirable. She skillfully accomplishes a change of manner, if not of character, required by the plot, and at all times seems to be the woman she is impersonating. The others in the cast, particularly Fontaine La Rue as an invalid, Frederick Vroom as her husband, and Adolph Manjou as the Healer's principal opponent, are entirely satisfactory.Another charming post nature picture, \\"The Lone Indian,\\" is on the Criterion's program. A custom of certain Canadian Indians, it is said, is to send out into the forest alone any youth who has failed to measure up to the standards required of the hunter, so that he may find full manliness and return to the tribe or stay away forever if the right stuff is not in him. Many strikingly beautiful and picturesque scenes are given interesting continuity in \\"The Lone Indian\\" by the wandering of one of these youths seeking and finding his manhood.Also at the Criterion is an Ollendorff Sketchograph, \\"Eve's Leaves,\\" a sort of Wellsian outline of the history of feminine dress, interesting, amusing and well-executed, except in places where the dissolve is used without logical justification.A white child is adopted by a Chinese and raised to young womanhood among Chinese in China and San Francisco, with no one's suspecting that she is not of pure Celestial birth—and thereby hangs \\"A Tale of Two Worlds,\\" the photoplay at the Capitol this week. If you can accept this beginning, and also a number of succeeding incidents of highly improbable nature, you are likely to enjoy the melodrama, which Gouverneur Morris has written and Frank Lloyd directed, with Beatrico Joy, Wallace Beery, J. Frank Glendon and Jack Abbe in the principal parts. The story is theatrically, if not actually, Chinese, and, for all of its mechanical method, it is climactic. It is a thriller which sometimes thrills.This is chiefly because Mr. Lloyd is a capable cinematician and the actors, while not particularly Chinese in appearance, are melodramatically expressive, especially Miss Joy, Mr. Beery and the apparently young Mr. Abbe, who gives the most persuasive performance of all. The photography, too, is noteworthy. Some of the night scenes are exceedingly well done.Of course, if you insist on something of logic and plausibility in a photoplay, \\"A Tale of Two Worlds\\" cannot meet your demands. Incidentally, it is the first story written directly for the screen by Mr. Morris, but there does not seem to be any-conspicuous sign that the author has become fluent in the language of moving pictures.There is also a mildly amusing Edgar comedy. \\"Get Rich Quick Edgar,\\" at the Capitol, and a Bruce scenic, \\"Water Trails,\\" which the reviewer regrets having had to miss.\\"The Second Latchkey,\\" with Katherine MacDonald, and Mack Sennett's \\"Love, Honor and Behave,\\" are at the Strand: \\"Beau Revel,\\" with Florenes Vidor, is at the Rivoli, and \\"The Plaything of Broadway,\\" with Justine Johnstone, is at the Rialto.The Fox production, \\"A Connecticut Yankee,\\" opens at the Selwyn Theatre tonight.

For each photographer, the person in front of the camera has something to say about himself, and it is the photographer's job to reveal that in his or her own way. This can be interpreted by the choice of camera angle, lighting and film, plus selecting the decisive point in which a moment of that subject's life is frozen in time and space.   In this writer's opinion, the ideal portrait is an image that stands somewhere between what a portrait photographer would create in a studio and what a photojournalist would create working on the outside. A studio portrait photographer would use soft focus and diffusion as a tool to soften lines and minimize wrinkles and blemishes, while the photojournalist would rarely, if ever, consider using those techniques.

They found that both groups reported strikingly similar experiences, although those who really were near death were more likely to report an enhanced perception of light and enhanced cognitive ability.    The study, by J. E. Owens, E. W. Cook and I. Stevenson of the division of personality studies, is reported in the current issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.   The researchers said the findings appeared to lend some support to each of three theories that have been proposed to explain near-death experiences: the transcendental theory argues that these experiences provide a glimpse of the hereafter","excerpt":"the physiological theory suggests that they are the result of biological states that accompany the process of dying, and the psychological theory says that they are a response to the perceived threat of dying.

The physiological theory was supported by evidence that patients who were near death had experiences that occurred more frequently than among those who were not dying.    The transcendental theory, they said, was supported by evidence that dying patients reported enhanced cognitive functions despite the likelihood that their brain function had diminished.   \\"We need more studies like this before we can draw conclusions,\\" said Bruce Greyson, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Connecticut who has also studied near-death experiences. \\"But it's possible that a near-death experience can have psychological, physiological and transcendental aspects.\\" At the Brink of Death"},{"year":"1994","title":"It wasn't until Radu Lupu played two encores in Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night that this intriguing pianist's goals became clear.

At his best, Mr. Lupu, a Romanian who first attracted attention when he won the 1969 Leeds Piano Competition, is capable of this kind of nocturnal yet crisp playing. He doesn't really seem to care if anybody is listening; he is playing as if for himself, giving the music an unusual immediacy. Mr. Lupu's stage persona reinforces the impression of solitude.

In his most recent collection of short stories, Trevor unspools 12 small-scale dramas about secrets, heartbreaks and missed romantic connections. As always, this Irish-born author sets his uncannily focused fiction about personal troubles against the larger backdrop of the Troubles in Ireland. ''His literary art has become exploratory, rather than clinically diagnostic or satiric, and in so doing it has become more generous toward his characters,'' William H. Pritchard wrote here last year.    6 NIGHTMARES: Real Threats in a Dangerous World and How America Can Meet Them, by Anthony Lake. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $15.95.) New, easily transported weapons of mass destruction -- chemical, biological (think Anthrax) and computer-based -- are among the specters outlined in grim detail by the former national security adviser under President Clinton. In this ''useful list of the real threats to American security . . . Lake shows an easy mastery of the subject, high intelligence and good judgment,'' Fareed Zakaria said here in 2000.    I LOVED YOU ALL, by Paula Sharp. (Theia/Hyperion, $13.95.) This old-fashioned storytelling novel about anti-abortion fanatics in the 1970's revolves around the struggle for the soul of a 15-year-old girl who falls under the sway of a fundamentalist baby sitter after her alcoholic mother is sent off to a rehab center. ''Sharp's gifts are enormous,'' Craig Seligman wrote here last year. ''Even the minor characters seem ready to get up and step off the page.''    THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO BE INTELLIGENT: Selected Essays, by Lionel Trilling. Edited by Leon Wieseltier. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16.) The renowned American literary critic wrote on a wide range of subjects during his heyday from the 1940's until his death in 1975, and he towered over his rivals with the breadth of his learning and the authority of his insights on Keats and Austen, among others. ''One can recommend'' this large collection ''as either an introduction to or reminder of Lionel Trilling, one of the few intelligent men of our time toward whose work . . . an intellectual obligation exists,'' Richard Gilman wrote here in 2000.    DIAMOND DOGS, by Alan Watt. (Warner, $13.95.) In this dark first novel, a sadistic high school football star kills a classmate in an accident in suburban Las Vegas, and his abusive father -- who happens to be the local sheriff -- helps him cover up the crime. ''Watt delivers a moving, multifaceted story that sharply explores the legacy of violence, distorted forms of love and the high cost of genuine freedom,'' Megan Harlan wrote here last year.

Molly Benson is a rich, eccentric woman from New Jersey who adopts Greene as her conscience and moral guide after a chance encounter with her idol in Antibes. Following his death, Molly's desperate pursuit of worthy causes leads her on a disastrous mission to protect Algerian journalists from hit squads. The result is ''a funny, moving and strangely profound'' first novel, William Boyd wrote here in 2000. ''I think Graham Greene would have been pleased.''    THE ATLANTIC SOUND, by Caryl Phillips. (Vintage International, $13.) The author, who was born in St. Kitts and raised in England, ponders the relationship between people of his own ancestry and those of Europe, Africa and North America, in the process illuminating the many cultural collisions that have flowed from the slave trade. In our review last year, Geoffrey Moorhouse called this ''an extremely balanced assessment'' that sheds ''further light on the intricate patterns and prejudices of race.''

Kurosawa was almost ruthlessly anti-sentimental and is not particularly celebrated for his female protagonists. Yet there's what feels like an idealized, late-in-life tenderness in this story of Edo Period prostitutes, particularly in the character O-Shin (Nagiko Tohno). O-Shin isn't just a hooker with a heart of gold &#151; she's all heart. Away from the brothels, she probably could pass for a young woman with a future; she doesn't have the hard-bitten sulkiness of her colleagues, principally Kikuno (Misa Shimizu), who dotes on O-Shin but knows what a fool for love her friend is.  &quot;Sea&quot; rolls through the seasons &#151; all of them &#151; and Kurosawa's script treads the delicate line between conventional mortality and decency, as does much of his finest work. This material is simple nearly to the point of simple-mindedness, though. But the movie isn't dumb, although it is dismaying to learn that even Kurosawa had an unfilmed script romanticizing hookers' need for love. O-Shin isn't treated as a bashful novice.  Fortunately Mr. Kumai, who himself has shown no aversion to baroque melodrama, leans toward a plain and direct style that's tasteful and intelligent, a boon given the predictability of the story. We're lucky, too, because Ms. Shimizu's command of character has an astringent effect as well, which is needed. By the time the film's typhoon of a climax slams into view, &quot;The Sea Is Watching'' has made emotional waves of its own. &#151; Elvis Mitchell A Director's Wooziness Finds Kurosawa's Softer Side"},{"year":"1932","title":"A MAN came out into the hot damp air of a July night in Tokyo and hung up a cotton flag intimating that for the rest of the evening the price of admission to the Atago Kinema would be five cents. Some young men in stiff, newly laundered kimonos, who had been lounging about the cases of photographs each side of the door, immediately began to file past the painted face in the box office, getting yellow slips of paper in exchange for their coins.The theatre, a square hall built of tin, its roof lined with varnished paper, was already crowded. The backless benches on the floor were full. In two small side galleries, the height of a man's shoulder, family parties squatted on straw mats. The grandfather of eighty Winters was there and the baby born last week. The atmosphere was steamy and intensely hot. An odor of freshly ironed cotton mingled with that of the hair oil on 500 glossy black heads.Every inch of space was filled. A double row of people hung over the rail that fenced off the orchestra—a piano and violin. The aisles were packed with standing people.The lights were lowered and a shadowy Japanese figure in a priestly gown, with a crucifix dangling at the end of a chain, appeared momentarily on the screen. A window behind him took shape, in front of it a cross rose from the altar","excerpt":"the picture moved across the screen revealing a crowded congregation of Japanese Christians, silent, intent, devout. The violin softly wailed the strains of \\"Lead, Kindly Light.\\"A Simple Story.As the congregation streamed down the steps, a student and a girl became detached from the throng, and the story began to tell itself. It was the story of a Shinju, a double love suicide. Each time \\"the season of green leaves\\" comes round such suicides are reported almost daily. Elements of unusual pathos had fixed this one in the public imagination. It has already produced a fatal harvest of imitations; many frustrated couples have followed the lovers to their next and happier incarnation. The news story, made into a film of 50 minutes duration and entitled \\"Hearts Reunited in Heaven,\\" was what I had come to see.Love at first sight evidently. The young pair walk bashfully along by a quiet wall. Three fellow students appear puffing cigarettes and jeering. It is a trying moment, for in Japan, where co-edism would be considered a form of decadence, walking with a girl is not done. But the entrapped youth, keeping his temper, introduces his comrades to the girl and they recover their politeness.Now we have been introduced; we kno the style of our characters and their social position. They are Japanese Christians; that is, their parents are modern and well-to-do, and, to use an unjustly decayed word, \\"respectable.\\" New England itself can hardly match the intense, Godfearing, Puritanical respectability of that class. It is the salt of Japan. He is a tall, thin lad with black eyebrows that meet, and a good-looking ugly face. She is a small miss with a small face; expressionless by all rotogravure standards—not once do her teeth flash—and plain. But it is astonishing how much expression an immobile face can convey.So we are well introduced; we know our characters and like them, and that is half the story-teller's battle. Clean young people cleanly in love. The shadow of consumption lies heavy over young Japan and it falls across the page; the girl goes to a seaside villa to recuperate. You see her lonely, looking out on the pines and the sea. She writes a letter, queer Chinese characters, written from top to bottom and from right to left. The imagination of the audience is not asked to make an effort. The student at his books, receiving the letter, clutches the time table, runs a pen along the figures: \\"Tokyo dep. 10.05; Hiratsuka arr. 12.07.\\" The arm of a signal dips; the train rushes through the landscape; by the veritable white enamel bricks of the subway in Hiratsuka station Damon, in a white raincoat, meets Chloe in her blue and white Summer kimono, the colors of the sea and the sky. No smiles, no eyes, only a little jerky bow, and they are walking on the sands, the Pacific breaking at their feet.The Last Walk.The rest can be compressed. Recovery; marriage preliminaries à la Japonaise: he obtains his father's consent; the go-between, that indispensable aide to Cupid, gets to work. But the arranged marriage is the rule of Japan. Her father has another husband for her and disobedience to parents is \\"not done.\\" Once more the boy sets out for Hiratsuka in answer to her request, taking a bottle of cyanide solution with him. A last walk on the sands under the pines. You need not know a single one of those spidery Chinese ideographs to understand what they are saying. You cannot miss what she means when she lifts that small composed face and almost imperceptibly bows. They turn inland among the rough grasses. As they pass a ruined Buddhist temple, the log of wood that strikes the temple bell swings. It is a silent film, but the action calls up that most musical and solemn of all sounds, the temple bell. He spreads his white raincoat on the grass and they sit down, to fade out while the stained glass window and the cross return, and the violin plays \\"Nearer, My God, to Thee.\\"As to the ethics of taking a tragedy of real life from the newspapers and putting it on the screen, no offense was seen, by the audience. Most of them, would have been puzzled to say why what was told in the newspapers could not also be told on the screen. Knowing nothing about film production and plenty about the production of newspaper stories, I admit that the film told the story better. I don't say that here is an example for Hollywood to follow. The effect of \\"Hearts Reunited in Heaven\\" was due to its simplicity, which the audience shared. Without that innate simplicity the story could not have been told without creating a sense of outrage. But what a medium for such a story!

In fact, it is a simple matter for the spectator to step into the lobby at almost any moment during the course of the film, smoke a cigarette and return without having missed anything.Not a single snigger was elicited from the audience during a showing yesterday. The director of the film seems to have the peculiar notion that by flashing a view of two persons smiling at each other over some pleasantry he will cause the audience to burst into laughter.The mythical Kingdom of Leuchtenstein in the film is the seat of scandal, and when its Prime Minister dies, his consort, a baroness, in order to save herself from being dispossessed of her many holdings acquired during her husband's administration, professes to have his memoirs and threatens to publish them. The supposedly comic situations arise when those who imagine themselves mentioned in the manuscript attempt to secure her favor in the hope of gaining possession of the manuscript.This brings slapstick into a photoplay already consisting of a mixture of drama, light comedy, farce and melodrama. Olga Chekova, as the baroness who holds the threat of exposure over the heads of the public officials, is comely but decidedly unsuited to light rôles.

(Courage Books/Running Press, $14.98.) Covering a genre of movies that runs from \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" to \\"Little Shop of Horrors,\\" \\"The Look of Horror\\" is a compressed history that is long on images and short on words, a well-illustrated, smartly written recap of some of the more frightening moments in movie history -- and the faces that make those moments memorable. This is a fan's book and never pretends to be a groundbreaking study of horror films. No long-winded theories or footnotes about What It All Means, just page after page of the bright, fantastic visions from the classics we know so well (and some we may have forgotten). Jonathan Sternfield, a freelance writer and photographer, breaks his study into different sections, covering aliens, creatures, ghosts and the demons among us -- the bad seeds, the ordinary people who can be the most terrifying monsters around. The author wisely keeps his opinions short, crisp and to the point. His text amounts to plot summaries and critical commentaries on the quality of the films. What animates this book are the photos of these scary monsters and super freaks. Mr. Sternfield has some interesting inclusions: in a book rife with werewolves, blobs and tarantulas the size of 747's, for example, he has included \\"Fatal Attraction\\" as a horror film for a new generation. We cover the gamut here, from monsters alien and otherwise to seemingly innocent demonic devices (the car in John Carpenter's \\"Christine,\\" the red-headed doll in \\"Child's Play\\"). Mr. Sternfield delivers what he promises and does it in a loose, readable style. And the coffeetable format makes it effective","excerpt":"the pictures are large and lurid -- the better to frighten you with, my dear.

Some will criticize them as simply further entries in the long history of male artists depicting unclothed women, while others will object to the fact that a number of Mr. Friedlander's photographs show the models' genitalia in explicit detail.    Mr. Friedlander resolutely refuses to idealize the women he photographs. On the contrary, he records their body hair, bruises, dirty feet and sagging flesh in sometimes excruciating detail. To borrow a distinction made by the art historian Sir Kenneth Clark, Mr. Friedlander's women are more naked than nude","excerpt":"the pictures show specific women's bodies, rather than some generalized ideal of womanhood.

For it happens, that aside from its near-monopoly on sound patents, the Tobis also has had considerable recent success in picture production (e. g. \\"Kermesse Heroique\\"). But for a decade and longer this had been Ufa's uncontested prerogative. Perhaps her enormous new studios at Neubabelsberg and Tempelhof and their seemingly unavoidable bureaucratic accessories are proving too cumbersome an apparatus. At any rate the fact remains that there is a lack of red corpuscles in much of the Ufa output, while the Tobis, with its numerous independent production units, has greater flexibility, more elbow room.This latest Tobis picture \\"If We All Were Angels\\" can claim for itself a number of attributes: a lively story, comedy that remains funny from whichever social or political angle the public views it","excerpt":"the picturesque setting of the scenic wine country along the Rhine; an excellent cast that seems to have been born there, topped by the garrulous Heinz Reuhmann; superior sound and camera work and a director who adroitly tangles and entangles the skeins and braids them into the most amusing pattern. Karl Froelich, who has to his credit \\"Traumulus,\\" the profoundly moving prize film of last Winter, has here produced his most successful comedy counterpart.In exactly the same ratio as Froelich has veered over toward the film's more flippant manifestations, Reinhold Scheunzel, heretofore Germany's high-class comedy director, went in for old-fashioned emotion and a study in psychology in his Ufa film \\"Irene,\\" which was premièred the same evening. The English play of the same name by Aimée and Philip Stuart had a fairly successful run here last season and Scheunzel even went so far as to film-début Sabine Peters in the title part which she had also played on the stage. This not exactly sympathetic rôle of the adolescent girl who, in jealous desperation over her widowed mother's remarriage, first tries to kill her stepfather and, failing, attempts suicide, is handled sensitively and without hysteria by Sabine Peters. Scheunzel offsets this tragic conflict by sprightly comedy of which the biggest percentage goes to the pert Baba, Irene's younger and unencumbered sister. As played by Geraldine Katt, another film débutante and an uncontested find, the part turns out to be the propelling force of the whole story.Not nearly as convincing is the Tobis-sponsored film version of Oscar Wilde's \\"A Woman of No Importance.\\" It is essentially a dialogue film, adapted by Thea von Harbou and Bernd Hoffman. Wilde's glib aphorisms are merely used as ornaments for the conflict between Sylvia Kelvil and Lord Illingworth which now holds the center—the fight of a mother to keep her son and deny him to a father who had deserted her.This month's harvest of American films has been meager. MGM's \\"Viva Villa!\\" was shown to only fair success in a completely warped copy due to officious censorship; the Marmorhaus has billed Paramount's program picture, \\"The Princess Comes Across,\\" and at the Ufa Kurfuerstendamm Shirley Temple is having the least of her successes in \\"Captain January,\\" here renamed \\"Shirley Ahoi.\\" THE SCREEN IN BERLIN; Tobis, Taking the Lead from Ufa, Scores a Hit With 'If We All Were Angels'"},{"year":"1930","title":"Article on \\"bindle stiffs,\\" THE \\"BINDLE STIFF\\" NEARS THE END OF HIS LONG TRAIL","excerpt":"The Picturesque Worker by Summer and Loafer By Winter, Makes Last Stand in West An Expert on Loafing."},{"year":"1928","title":"Feature article by J W Gerard GERARD CONDEMNS THE MOVIE \\"DAWN\\"","excerpt":"The Picturized Story of Edith Cavell Is Strongly Objected to by the Former Ambassador as Untrue and Provocative of Hate The Film Story.

Mr. Hart, who teaches literature at the University of Essex in England, elegantly and lucidly explores thinking about flight and flying machines from preclassical times to the 18th century. ''The Prehistory of Flight'' is not, he tells us, a general survey of aviation - his ''Dream of Flight'' (1972) was about practical attempts at flying, and he promises a later book about the iconography of flight. Instead, this beautifully illustrated volume explores what sages through the centuries have thought about flying and how they have applied scientific principles to the problem of human flight. He tells us, for example, that some commentators, believing human flight to be inevitable, urged that all flying machines be owned or regulated by the state. Others predicted disaster and felt that if people could fly, no one would be safe from marauding aeronauts. Mr. Hart also examines several heavier-than-air inventions, including Burattini's flying dragon (whose landings, the 17th-century Italian engineer promised, would cause ''only the most minor injuries''), Swedenborg's flying saucer and Pierre Desforges's airborne gondola (which, unlike many others discussed here, was actually tested, in 1772","excerpt":"the pilot, the Abbe Desforges himself, escaped with only a bruised elbow).

Scar, manner and all, he goes with a nice young girl to save her brother from the deepening shadows of the chair. He does it, finally, after a free-for-all fight and a couple of double-crossings. Then he discovers that he is in love. The picture ends there—leaving no indications that the Messrs. Warner ever decided just who is paying the piper.However, it is to be assumed that Diamond Joe Jennings probably does it. That worthy, at all events, commits the murder for which Tim Brady—young enough to be an orchestra leader, although he isn't—is tried and convicted. An unpleasant man, Diamond Joe has a failing. He likes to drink. During one of his nocturnal sprees he boasts of his triumphs to Kitty. She tells Nora Brady.Now, Nora is the older sister of the incarcerated Tim. She realizes that something must be done about his freedom. Diamond Joe has promised to see the Governor, but she sometimes wonders. She decides to tell the police. They are friendly and nice, and they assign Dan Hogan, brother of the murdered patrolman, to the case. He puts on a scar and joins Nora in the Joe-Kitty menage. It is a strictly business arrangement, however, an agreement by which that thing called love is to take a back seat. And fair enough.Then Diamond Joe begins to have his suspicions about his new boarder. He starts to shoot once, but thinks better of it. Finally he is persuaded to take the young man to a dance, where some of his followers might be able to recognize him. They can't immediately, but one of them makes easily the most intelligent suggestion in the film.\\"Say,\\" he says, \\"is there any chance of that scar on his face being phony?\\"\\"I never thought of that,\\" confesses Joe.So, a little later Joe gets Kitty to rub off the scar with her fan, and the plot is discovered. Dan is taken to a back room, and Nora—claiming that she has been double-crossed too—offers to shoot him. When she gets the pistol, she lines every one against the wall and waits for the police. These worthies arrive presently, and Diamond Dan is killed trying to escape the retributions for his sins.Lila Lee takes the part of Nora, William Boyd that of Diamond Joe, Betty Compson is Kitty and Monte Blue is the worthy Dan Hogan, pseudo gunman from Detroit. The latter actor goes through his performance as if he, at least, were \\"kidding\\"—even though the producers may not be. On Saturday night \\"Those Who Dance\\" was further complicated by the synchronizing device's being out of tune—a temporary defect which added considerably to the audience's amusement.The rest of the Beacon's program includes Eddie Buzzell in a short comedy, an extremely entertaining animated cartoon, a phantasy played by \\"thirty talented children,\\" and Helen Broderick in a carefree piece called \\"Nile Green.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Piper Overpaid.

M. Barrie play. Mr. Disney's animated cartoon of the widely loved children's fantasy is frankly and boldly created in what may best be described as \\"Disney style.\\" The characters are drawn and animated in such a way that they readily recall not only the appearance but the behavior of familiars in other Disney films.That is to say, the well-bred Wendy is a virtual duplicate of the prim Snow White","excerpt":"the pirate, Smee, is the same as the dwarf, Happy, and Baby Michael is a Dopey who talks. Captain Hook, the horrendous villain, is J. Worthington Foulfellow in plumes and Peter himself is reminiscent of some of the boys in \\"Pinoccnio.\\" As for the famous Barrie fairy, the crystalline and luminous Tinker Bell, she is as nubile and coquettish as the maiden centaurs in \\"Fantasia.\\"What's more, Mr. Disney has completely eliminated from his film the spirit of guileless credulity in fairy magic that prevails in the play. He gets into his story of the English children who are wafted away to Never Land by the eternally youthful Peter and his companion, Tinker Bell, by making it very obvious that the whole adventure is a dream and offering the helpful suggestion that adults take it as a token of the spirit of youth. And he has dropped entirely the crisis that is the climax of the play, wherein the audience is begged to shout its belief in fairies to save the imprisoned Tinker Bell.Perhaps these eliminations were prompted by a belief that present-day adults and children are more literal than they were in Barrie's time. Perhaps they were due to some anxiety that the mention of pixiness in the modern American movie theatre might provoke some embarrassment. And it may also be that Mr. Disney and his artists, for all their craft and skill, are still a wee bit unresponsive where the delicacies of whimsy are concerned.Anyhow, Mr. Disney's picture, which went on at the Roxy yesterday along with his True-Life film, \\"Bear Country,\\" has the story but not the spirit of \\"Peter Pan\\" as it was plainly conceived by its author and is usually played on the stage.However, that's not to say it isn't a wholly amusing and engaging piece of work within the defined limitations of the aforementioned \\"Disney style.\\" The Disney inventions are as skillful and clever as they have ever been—perhaps even more so, in some cases, as in the encounter of Captain Hook with the Crocodile. This episode in the story has been worked out in a burst of violent farce, with Hook struggling frantically to stay out of the ferocious old Crocodile's pink maw. The colors, too, are more exciting and the technical features of the job, such as the synchronization of voices with the animation of lips, are very good.Such things as the innovation of a visit to the Indian Village by the Lost Boys (to the tune of a lively ditty, \\"Tee Dum, Tee Dee\\") and a powwow there with the Indians to \\"What Makes the Red Man Red\\" rollick with gleeful vitality, and one bit, wherein the pirate, Smee, shaves the tail of a seagull that has settled on Hook's face, is a cartoonist's gem.The music, too, is animated, from the opening \\"You Can Fly—You Can Fly\\" to a cheerfully flippant pirate ditty, \\"The Elegant Captain Hook.\\"As we say, the characters are familiar, but none the less vigorously conceived, with Peter and Hook the most commanding and elastically contrived. Tinker Bell is a bit of a vulgarity, with her bathing-beauty form and attitude, but even she—like Peter's harem of doting mermaids—is cleverly and expertly drawn. Wendy and the other children, plus Nana, the nurse-maid dog, are merely good, pious Disney creations in a firstclass, feature-length \\"Disney cartoon.\\"As for \\"Bear Country,\\" it follows in the excellent series of nature films that have been produced by the Disney studio, such as \\"Seal Island\\" and \\"Water Birds.\\" This one studies the environment and habits of American wild bears to reveal both the sturdiness and cunning of these amiable-looking animals. The most amusing sequence in the picture is a montage of bears scratching themselves, done to a deft bolero rhythm. It's a case of trick editing, but it's fun.No wonder the kiddies and their parents were beating down the doors yesterday.The stage show at the Roxy is another production of the \\"Ice Colorama,\\" featuring the Roxy Skating Blades and Belles.

One of the film's discrete, lengthy sections, which are loosely linked by cacophonous and turbulent staircase images, shows a woman dressed as in a Dutch painting, depositing a pitcher of milk on a table. A still-life bowl of fruit is on the table, and a man sits on a chair. The speed with which the woman moves, the lighting above her and even the fate of the milk are carefully regulated. Sometimes the milk spills. Sometimes it spills repeatedly. At one point a succession of falling-pitcher images is linked to form an arc.

I'll save some film for tonight's party, especially since I heard that Lauren Bacall might be there. Last year she went to the same party and sang a song. What a treat. I can actually be photographed with the woman who taught a whole generation how to whistle. Bogie's love! Gracious, the excitement is building.   Party starts at 6. I plan to take some more pictures there but I'm careful to make sure there's at least one left for Lauren.   Now it's 7:40 and I say: \\"Forget it. I'm leaving.\\" Indeed, I have only one picture left. Two acquaintances, John and Connie, catch me on the way out and say, \\"George, take our picture.\\" What the heck. Lauren is a no-show. I take the picture and on my way out, in walks Lauren.   So now my Kodak moment of Lauren Bacall is a pictue of John and Connie. GEORGE T.

At the same time, he has got into this picture, which runs about an hour and a quarter, a sense of the spiritual refuge which Israel is to Europe's displaced Jews.Armed with a silent camera and a cast of actors, among whom the leading player, Avraham Doryon (Sroka), was the only professional, Mr. Krumgold shot this picture two years ago in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and at the Degania settlement, a typical kibbutz or collective farm. And in it he shows the experience by which a poor and bewildered young Jew, arriving in Israel from Europe, adapts himself to a new way of living among friends.By the documentary technique, Mr. Krumgold's camera provides the illustrative pictures","excerpt":"the place of dialogue is taken throughout by off-screen narrators or commentators who explain the story and reflect thereon. And in this latter area the picture is less to be admired, for its narration is not only inflated but ineffectual in conveying convincing thoughts.In the role of the young Jew, Mr. Doryon gives an effective and often amusing pantomime of a poor fellow, lost in the confusion of a new home, new friends and a new romance. And a pretty young lady named Chava Alperstein is silently bewitching as the girl who holds out a hand of friendship, understanding and eventually love. Others in the cast are likewise pleasant as established colonists.But the strangely involved and over-written explanation of the young fellow's plight is remote from the sincere simplicity of the neat pictorial report. As often happens in documentary pictures, the narration runs away with the film. A grandiloquent \\"introduction\\" of the players forecasts this defect.

He will be the highest-ranking French official during the German occupation to go on trial on charges of complicity in crimes against humanity, and only the second French citizen to be tried on those grounds since World War II. The case is forcing France to confront the wartime role of anonymous civil servants and other French functionaries.   A1    Failed Attack Angers Israelis  After four days of silence about allegations of a botched Israeli assassination attempt against a Hamas leader in Jordan, Israelis loosed a fierce barrage of accusations against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a debacle that stood to seriously damage Israel on every political and security front. The Israeli Cabinet, while avoiding direct comment on the situation, sought to justify the operation.   A1    Pope Ends Visit to Brazil  Pope John Paul II wrapped up his visit to Brazil with an open-air Mass in Rio de Janeiro that drew an estimated two million people and seemed to rival the increasingly popular television evangelists for color and splash, while maintaining the Catholic church's traditional focus on the inviolability of the family.   A3    A U.N. Official's Difficult Task  Mary Robinson, 53, who resigned as President of Ireland last month, has been the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for barely three weeks, but she has been busy: soothing China, reacting calmly to Afghanistan and warning the Democratic Republic of Congo, the former Zaire. She has already come under attack for remarks that angered Algeria.   A10    Congo Warns Aid Agencies  Two days after expelling some United Nations workers, the Government of Congo said that it was considering closing down several other refugee agencies in eastern Congo.

The White House has insisted that the coffees were not fund-raising events. But a tape of one coffee seemed to suggest that some donors thought otherwise, as the Democratic Party's national chairman could be heard refusing an offer of five checks.   A1    A Case of Corporate Hardball  As a vote approaches on whether Cashmere, Wash., should give in to demands by a candy company to make its main product the town theme, the showdown has some residents lashing out against what they call corporate bullying.

A12    New Term for Supreme Court  The new Supreme Court term opens today, bringing the Justices their most important affirmative action case in years, an employment dispute that could rewrite the ground rules for taking race into account in both public and private workplaces. This case is one of 59 cases the Court has agreed so far to review. There are few potential landmarks on the docket so far, but the cases present issues as diverse as sex discrimination in Federal immigration law and the First Amendment implications of excluding minor-party candidates from campaign debates on public television.   A13    Clinton Plans Veto Session  President Clinton plans to wield his veto pen today for the second time by crossing out as many as 50 pet projects worth about $300 million in the $9.2 billion military construction bill, White House officials said.

A16    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Corruption Punished More Than Police Brutality  Internal Police Department documents show that New York officers are most often dismissed not for brutality but for overt, nonviolent acts of criminality or corruption, like selling steroids. In the year and half that Howard Safir has been Police Commissioner, only eight officers have lost their jobs for using excessive force. Police officials say this stems partly from the difficulty in judging when officers go too far. Critics say it reflects a greater hesitancy to punish officers for brutality than for corruption.   A1    A County's Growing Pains  One hundred developers and landowners, 98 percent of them from Putnam County, have filed a lawsuit charging that New York City's tight watershed regulations are taking away their property and development rights.

Messinger accused Mayor Giuliani of orchestrating ''an attack by one Jew against another Jew'' after a political ally of the Mayor, Jules Polonetsky, wrote a letter to a Jewish newspaper describing the prospect of a Messinger mayoralty as ''our worst nightmare.'' Within hours after Ms. Messinger made her remarks, Mr. Polonetsky apologized for having ''characterized my opposition to Ms. Messinger in terms of only one community.''   B1    Yale Celebrates Prosperity  With the completion of its $1.5 billion fund drive last week, Yale University is celebrating a turnaround. At the start of the campaign, in 1992, Yale was running a $12 million deficit and faculty members were angry over a plan to shrink their numbers. Now, having raised $200 million more than the goal, Yale is prospering.   B4    Trash Dispute in New Jersey  In May, a Federal appeals court found that New Jersey's longstanding control over garbage disposal was anti-competitive, so counties have struck out on their own to make cheaper arrangements.

A friend calls to tell him that the garden Mr. Spain started for him did not survive the winter. And every year, Mr. Spain visits a friend's garden and proclaims the cactuses, although shriveled, very much alive and no worse for the snow, harsh winds and sub-zero temperatures. It seems even Mr. Spain's friends have a hard time believing his cactus claim: hundreds of varieties of cactuses, including the well-known prickly pear, can be grown outdoors in Connecticut and survive the winter. There is even a cactus that is native to Connecticut, a wildflower. But Mr. Spain is doubted still","excerpt":"the plants are perceived as much a symbol of the desert as rattlesnakes and scorpions. A retired Uniroyal training executive, Mr. Spain says he has one of the largest  collections of winter-hardy cactuses in the country. He grows hundreds of varieties in his backyard, a slice of the Southwest that is only a few yards from rhododendron and fern. The cactuses may seem out of place, but they thrive north of the Mason/Dixie line and can carry a bed all by themselves. They come in various shapes, sizes and blooms of yellow, orange, pink and red. A 60-foot-long bed of cactus only is the centerpiece of Mr. Spain's backyard garden. For the size of his cactus garden, he said he puts in few hours; cactus, of course, require little water. Also, few diseases afflict them in the state, and  they do not seem to be part of the food chain for beetles, deer or other pests.  But, for all these assets, outdoor cactus gardening in Connecticut is, well, novel.\\"People are always surprised,\\" Mr. Spain said. Most people in the state, including experienced gardeners, know little about cactus and generally assume they can't grow them outside, he said. Mr. Spain is always eager to correct misconceptions, and people who meet him soon learn that cactuses grow near the Arctic circle and in trees. They can be 20 years old and still no bigger than a golf ball, and the plants are native only to North and South America. Some gardeners are aware that cactuses can be grown in Connecticut, but are often mislead at nurseries where the perceived wisdom is that only one yellow-blooming variety is hardy to the region, he said. Before Roseann Richard, owner of Walnut Hill Greenhouse in Litchfield, met Mr. Spain about 10 years ago, she knew of no one who grew cactuses outdoors year-round in the state, and she did not think it possible. \\"He proved you could if you treat them a certain way,\\" she said. \\"Nobody knew which ones you could grow until he came along.\\" Through trial and error for more than three decades, Mr. Spain has assembled a list of plants that can grow in cold climates, and he has developed ways to help them adapt. When he started, he said, he found only two suppliers of winter-hardy cactus in  the entire country. Unlike someone trying to grow roses, Mr. Spain was not going to find answers to his horticultural problems in the local library or nursery. Due to this dearth of information, for almost as long as Mr. Spain has been growing winter-hardy cactuses, he has been educating the public about them. He and a few others successfully lobbied the Northeast Rock Garden Society to accept the cactus as a legitimate alpine plant, with a rock garden pedigree. Mr. Spain, a resident of Connecticut for 24 years, is also a founder and first president of the Connecticut Cactus and Succulent Society. He published a book on winter-hardy cactuses, helped many gardeners start their own collections, and is on the garden-club-speaker circuit. \\"He has definitely been the introducer of winter-hardy cactus in the state,\\" said Jack Phillips, the current president of the cactus society. \\"He has been willing to share time with anyone interested in this hobby.\\" Mr. Spain's passion for cactus developed by chance in 1966 due to a greenhouse too small for his ambitions. He said he wanted to spend his hours coaxing blooms from orchids, but could not because of the expense involved, and was frustrated  with begonias because they took too much room. Then he found the cactus. After a trip to Colorado, he returned with a few cactuses for his three young boys. Though thrilled at first, the boys lost interest in about 20 minutes. \\"So  then they were mine,\\" he said. \\"I discovered I could have a whole lot of them and you don't have to water every day.\\" Easy care is essential for a gardener who travels frequently and has a spouse more interested in needlepoint than horticulture. Soon after, Mr. Spain, then living in Michigan, met a person who grew cactus outdoors and that was the start of his winter-hardy passion. To keep costs down, he has grown many of his plants from seed. While some grow fast, others can take a year and a half just to be the size of a matchstick head. Mr. Spain said there are three main families of cactus that grow in cold climates: echinocereus, coryphantha and opuntia. However, within these families, there are hundreds of varieties. To survive the Connecticut climate, the cactuses need full sun (at least five hours) and excellent drainage. He suggests mixing a lot of sand and gravel into  the soil and using raised beds. Mr. Spain said cactuses do like humus-rich soil though. \\"They will be growing out of a rock, but don't be fooled, because inside the soil is black as can be,\\" he said. A few favorites growing in his own outdoor gardens include one that is 11 years  old \\"and still that tiny,\\" he said, pointing to a plant no bigger than a small loaf of bread. He also dotes on one particular opuntia fragilis, Bronze Beauty, which has pads  that turn bronze in winter. He likes it because he got to name it.

Dates of reviews and articles are in parentheses. Prices are current.    Cafe des Artistes     1 West 67th Street, (212) 877-3500 -- With its burnished-wood walls, lead-paned casement windows, bursts of flowers and Howard Chandler Christy's sylvan murals of frolicking nymphs, Cafe des Artistes has the warmth of a venerable cafe in Vienna or Budapest. The main room, dominated by a prodigious buffet, is more neighborly and louder than the intimate tables that ring the bar on the second level. Cafe des Artistes is one of the most popular restaurants on the Upper West Side -- reservations well in advance are a must -- and the scene is always buoyant and urbane.   The cooking in recent years has become bolder, more soulful, even sassy. A sumptuous a la carte Sunday brunch is served from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. It includes everything from omelets and salmon Benedict to pot-au-feu, fish stew and lobster salad. Carafes of mimosas are the drink of preference. Brunch runs about $25.   The Sunday dinner menu begins with the house special, salmon four ways (smoked, gravlax, tartar and poached)","excerpt":"the platter of cochonnailles (charcuterie of pork), which includes a well-seasoned jambon persille (ham and parsley terrine); a rough-textured terrine of pork studded with walnuts; unremittingly rich but delicious rillettes of pork, and earthy garlic sausage. With the banner of homey peasant food flying high these days, you may be tempted to try the superb sweetbread headcheese bound with a full-flavored gelatin.   Main courses on the winter menu include a superb pot-au-feu, swordfish paillard, succulent duck confit, grilled sweetbreads with tenderloin of pork and mushroom, and lentil cassoulet that contains duck, lamb, saucisson and venison sausage. A game festival is being held at the moment, so you can try venison with peppercorn sauce and chestnut puree, rabbit in Cognac with glazed onions and mushrooms, and grilled quail with juniper-berry butter. Cafe des Artistes has a well-chosen little wine list with prices starting around $25.   The dinner menu may be ordered prix fixe ($32.50) or a la carte, with appetizers priced from $8.50 to $10 and main courses from $15 to $32. Sunday hours are 5 to 11 P.M. (Reviewed April 6, 1990). Zarela     953 Second Avenue, near 61st Street, (212) 644-6740 -- Zarela, arguably the best Mexican restaurant in New York City, always has a festive air, owing largely to the exuberant proprietor, Zarela Martinez. The long tiled bar up front serves peppy citric margaritas that you tend to drink faster than you should while dipping nacho chips into a pepper-stoked salsa. Ms. Martinez has added Mexican touches here and there, including a mariachi trio, to the brick-walled downstairs dining room. The wood-paneled upstairs room is less raucous and more sedate.   Ms. Martinez's cooking is aggressive yet refined without lapsing into cuteness, and varied enough for all tastes, from the macho asbestos palates to those who prefer low-voltage spiciness. One of the spicier starters is the poblano relleno. The bulbous pepper is stuffed with diced chicken and dried fruits and set over a roasted-tomato sauce. The first sensations in the mouth are of the sweet fruit and the smoky sauce, then a hint of cinnamon, followed by a gradual attack of heat that, within 10 seconds, breaks out into a battle of the Alamo on the palate. Two of the tamer dishes are snapper hash and chilaquiles, which are fried tortilla strips overlaid with shredded chicken, tart sour cream and white cheddar cheese and baked until golden and bubbly. Chilaquiles come with either hot ranchero sauce or bright green tomatillo sauce.   Some of the more enticing main courses on the winter menu are roast duck with tomato and red chili sauce, dried apricots, prunes, raisins and pineapple; fajitas; ranch-style shrimp with tomato poblano salsa, and pozole guizado (corn kernels sauteed with jalapeno peppers, cilantro and tomato).   Appetizers run from $5.95 to $8.95, main courses from $10.95 to $16.95. Sunday hours are 5 to 10 P.M. (Reviewed Jan. 1, 1988). Hudson River Club     250 Vesey Street, in the World Financial Center, (212) 786-1500 -- New York City's relatively paltry selection of quality restaurants on the waterfront has been substantially enhanced with the arrival in early 1990 of the Hudson River Club, a handsome and comfortable dining room facing New York Harbor with the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in the distance. The food can be as inspiring as the setting. The Hudson River Club is in the imposing World Financial Center, which also houses offices, shops and a spectacular glass-enclosed public atrium.   Designed by Philip George, who also did Le Bernardin, the Hudson River Club is a long three-tiered space in light oak paneling with brass accents, subtle fabric-covered banquettes and handsome artworks of the Hudson Valley School. Befitting a place that caters to discreet bankers and brokers, conversations are well muffled. At lunch, the room is filled with dark-suited Wall Streeters, many with beepers, cellular telephones and hand-size computers on the tables.   The chef, Waldy Malouf, has created a cohesive and well-rounded menu emphasizing foods and wines from the Hudson River Valley. On Sunday there are four prix-fixe menus from which to choose -- at $25.50, $26.50, $27.50 and $28.50 -- in addition to an a la carte menu. Appetizers on the Sunday menu are pumpkin-and-apple soup, pheasant and venison terrine, jumbo asparagus vinaigrette and a bisque of crab and scallops. Choice among main courses are venison pot pie, roasted chicken, corn-encrusted scallops with apple-cider sauce, and a combination of lobster, shellfish and chicken. The dessert selection is copious: apple cheddar tart with caramel ice cream, stewed fruit with wild blueberry sorbet, chocolate brownies with raspberry ice cream, and warm bread pudding with berry sauce.   The restaurant makes an admirable effort to introduce regional American wines at fair prices, from not only California and the Hudson River Valley, but also such diverse places as Texas, the Pacific Northwest and Michigan. It would be helpful, though, if someone on the staff would take the initiative to describe some of the lesser-known wines to customers.   Appetizers on the a la carte menu range from $6 to $9.50, main courses from $17.50 to $24. Sunday hours are 1 to 6 P.M. (Reviewed Feb. 16, 1990). Petrossian     182 West 58th Street, (212) 245-2214 -- This sumptuous spot in the fanciful Alwyn Court strives to feed the soul as well the body with regal silver platters of foie gras, caviar, smoked salmon and Champagne. The dining room is a splendid work of art. The theme is Art Deco, with magnificent rose-colored Italian granite floors and bars upholstered in gray kid leather with mink trim. This is a suitable place to celebrate the passing of the old year with regal snacks at the bar. Under the new chef, Marc Salonsky, the restaurant food has improved considerably. Among the current appetizers are the Petrossian teasers, which feature smoked sturgeon rolls with zucchini and chive cream, a salad of fresh sea scallops with salmon roe, rosemary soup with shrimp kebab, spiced calamari with yogurt-and-vegetable coulis, and a foie gras tartlet with a pine nut salad. Main courses include seared salmon with smoked salmon ravioli and Pommery mustard sauce; roast sturgeon with braised cabbage, salmon roe, chanterelles and cracked pepper; roasted squab with raisin-nut strudel and foie gras sauce, and fillet of beef served with onion confit, roasted garlic and fresh thyme.   Three prix-fixe brunches are offered, from 11:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M., at $25, $30 and $35.   Appetizers range from $7 to $21, entrees from $26 to $32. Dinner is served from 5:30 to 11 P.M.

Fabrics, too, are gentle as well as gentlemanly: revivified flannels, updated with chalky stripes and plaids; soft and comfortable shetlands; colorfully dotted Donegal tweeds, often in blends which render them considerably less coarse than those from the past. (Because of the soaring cost of wool, tailored clothing, in fact, is being increasingly blended.) Even the still&#8208;important checks and plaids, no matter how im pressively sized, have a relaxed elegance. Witness, at left, the block&#8208;plaided jacket with a stitched&#8208;look overpane. By Larry Kane for Raffles Wear, it sports two buttons, center vent and is blended of wool and polyester. Ws $135 at B. Altman & Co. Under it, a long&#8208;sleeved, V&#8208;necked pullover provides the vested look slated to be very much in evi dence this winter. Some others: waist&#8208;length warm&#8208;ups, called baseball jackets last spring and now, in heftier fabrics, hailed as football jackets; mackinaw&#8208;plaided snow coats; sausage&#8208;quilted ski wear; bulky&#8208;knit shawl&#8208;collared cardigans (many in what has now been dubbed &#8220;winter while&#8221;); and enough bow ties to enable any man to be a Bow Blummell.

ART;\\nDramatic Neuberger Show Of Artist-Illustrated Books"},{"year":"1995","title":"MY acquisition of two classic 1930's chairs by Alvar Aalto, Finland's greatest modern architect and designer, was the inspiration for a 10-day drive through southern Finland last summer. I wanted to see more of Aalto's work, and planned a route that included a score of his finest buildings plus towns and churches from every period of Finnish history.   What I didn't expect was the abundant natural beauty of the Finnish countryside. When the sun emerged after a day of rain, it seemed to shine with a special intensity and to linger till nearly midnight. Scattered settlements punctuated vast expanses of lakes and forests. Everywhere I went there were stacks of fresh-cut birch logs, the scent of pine and the glint of light off water. Wildflowers carpeted meadows of luminous green.    Five million Finns inhabit a country that is only slightly smaller than Germany, and during the brief summer, in a sort of reverse hibernation, there's a mass exodus from the towns to remote islands and lakeside cottages. This leaves the rest of the country open to the few tourists who want to explore Finland's rich architectural heritage.   After a week in Helsinki and the industrial city of Tampere, I rented a car and drove in a 750-mile loop round the southern third of the country. My route took me west to Turku, Finland's first capital, north along the Gulf of Bothnia to Rauma, east to the lake country around Savonlinna, and back along the Russian border to the old town of Porvoo, a half-hour's drive from Helsinki airport. The roads were excellent and the signs (in Finnish and Swedish) almost too numerous, with country lanes as prominently marked as major highways. At every turn, there were signs warning of elk, which seem to outnumber cars away from the towns. Nearly everyone, even at rural gas stations, spoke good English and was happy to point the way. One of the nicer surprises was a daily radio news broadcast in Latin, presented as a public service by two classics professors in Helsinki. It seemed very accessible after hours of chatter in Finnish.   Two detours off the main road from Helsinki to Turku offer a crash course in Finnish history. The first, beside the Hanko road, is the tiny stone church of Lohja. Within the rough brick and stone walls is a medieval picture gallery. The painted rosettes and tendrils are as fresh as the flowers outside, and the biblical scenes have the unsophisticated vigor of present-day graffiti. Every surface is covered in ornament or storytelling. Churches like this, the only survivors of an era that used wood for its secular buildings, inspired the romantic historical revival that heralded Finland's independence movement a hundred years ago.   Sixty miles farther on is the turnoff for Paimio, and the innovative sanatorium that brought Alvar Aalto international fame. In his 50-year career, from the 1920's through the 1970's, Aalto infused the cool white geometry of modernism with the organic forms and the warmth of nature. Each of his varied buildings has a human scale and an easy practicality, and the sanatorium works almost as well today as when it was built. Visitors are welcome to walk around the white stucco buildings, climb the daffodil-yellow stairs and admire the splashes of color that make the communal areas feel more like a hotel than a hospital. Aalto designed all the furniture and lighting, and introduced balconies that give patients sweeping views of the surrounding forests.   Another gem of modern architecture, in a large cemetery in the eastern suburbs of Turku, is the Resurrection Chapel of Erik Bryggman, Aalto's contemporary. It is open daily except during memorial services. Sanctuary and nave are lighted from a window wall that frames a Japanese landscape of lichened pines, mossy rocks and dewy foliage.   Creeper climbs the wall behind the altar, and a symbolic tree of life is inlaid in wood on the pulpit. Light reflected off the terrazzo floor casts a sheen over the stained pine benches","excerpt":"the pleated folds of the walls and the curved battens around the organ animate this plain concrete structure.   Repeated fires destroyed the old quarters of Turku, and little of interest remains besides a cathedral and an over-restored castle. I headed north to the pleasant old town of Uusikaupunki to see its quartet of distinctive windmills and the hugely entertaining Bonk Museum. In a country that prides itself on its cutting-edge technology, and where almost everyone seems to have a cellular phone, a group of pranksters have mounted an elaborate hoax: a celebration of machines that never worked. Monty Python might have hatched the plot: A turn-of-the-century inventor is supposed to have imported Peruvian anchovies, harnessed them to generate electricity and then ground them into a condiment that he sold to the crowned heads of Europe. Riveted boilers and massive flywheels, dials and copper piping evoke the spirit of the Industrial Revolution. Attendants earnestly draw your attention to a fabricated page from the Scientific American describing Pare Bonk's amazing inventions, and explain the functions of a dozen lovingly crafted engines.    Rauma, 20 miles north, is the largest surviving wooden town in Finland and was designated a World Heritage Site by Unesco. Few of the individual buildings are remarkable; rather, it is the expanse, harmony and lack of commercialism that give the town its engaging period flavor. Granite outcrops punch through the orderly rows of painted wooden houses, and the market square is enlivened by the overscaled baroque cupola on the oddly two-dimensional city hall.    I continued north, past Pori to the village of Noormarkku, to see one of Aalto's masterpieces: the Villa Mairea, which he designed in 1937 for his patron, the industrialist Harry Gullichsen, and his wife, Maire. The modestly scaled wood-and-stucco facade and porch hint at the free flow of space within, from the skylighted cloakroom to the expansive living room. The core of the house feels like a stylized forest, with its wood-strip floor and ceiling, cane-wrapped columns and a sculptured staircase leading to the bedrooms.   Of all the great 20th-century European houses, it is closest in spirit to Frank Lloyd Wright in its fusion of structure and landscape and in its finely crafted details. But there are none of Wright's theatrical gestures; this house was made to fit its owners as comfortably as an old, well-cut suit.    Driving inland toward Jyvaskyla, I stopped to visit two lovely mid-18th-century churches, at Keuruu and Petajavesi. Both are triumphs of carpentry, with towering belfries, intricate vaulting and naive paintings.   In contrast, Jyvaskyla is a graceless, brutally modernized city, with expressways, ramps and one-way streets that seem designed to lead you astray. But it was Aalto's hometown, and within its borders are some of his earliest buildings (a workers' theater and a clubhouse), several university buildings, and a major museum that plays host to exhibitions and conferences on his work.   A FEW miles south is one of Aalto's finest civic projects: the all-brick town hall and library for the community of Saynatsalo. Turf-covered steps lead up to a grassy courtyard; a narrow stair ascends to a council chamber that's as dark and cozy as a sauna. It expresses the spirit of shelter that's needed during long, dark winters.   I spent a memorable Midsummer Night in Savonlinna, a town surrounded by water, 120 miles east of Jyvaskyla, on an old-fashioned lake steamer, decked with birch boughs, cruising around a shore on which every village and weekend cottage had its celebratory bonfire. Flames flickered against a still brilliant sky, and rival steamers raced ours with a frantic blast of whistles and cheers from passengers lining the rails.    Driving south from Savonlinna, skirting the Russian border, I passed Aalto's Church of the Three Crosses in Vuoksenniska; and Imatra, with its romantic resort hotel, the Valtion, on the edge of a waterfall. The white-walled church, with three distinct areas that can be separated by soundproof screens to accommodate different uses, reveals its organic delights slowly, expanding like a plant in the soft light. By contrast, the hotel is as theatrical as a 19th-century Bavarian castle.   Beyond the port city of Kotka is Langinkoski, a log cabin that was built a century ago as a fishing lodge for the Czar. Finland was then an autonomous duchy of the Russian Empire, and the St. Petersburg aristocracy would spend rustic vacations there. The cabin is preserved as it was in 1917, and it is easy to imagine the Czar and Czarina putting themselves into the shoes of their humbler subjects, doing their own cooking, sleeping in narrow cots and strolling through the surrounding woods.   By chance, I had saved the best till last. Porvoo is the second-oldest town in Finland, and one of the prettiest, least spoiled in Europe. Brightly colored wooden houses cluster around the medieval cathedral on its hilltop, and cobbled streets provide a constantly shifting perspective of fences, gables and courtyards. A row of dark red fishermen's huts borders a stretch of the river that divides the town.   Eating out in Finland is often monotonous, but the Wanha Laamanni, an 18th-century inn beside the cathedral, puts a fresh spin on salmon, herring and other familiar fare. On my last night there I was invited, along with a table of young Icelanders, to attend a village wedding in an upstairs room of the inn. She was plump and giggly; he was thin and serious in a borrowed morning coat. Shyly the newlyweds danced to the fiddle and concertina. I marveled, as I did so often on this trip, at Finland's skill in preserving its lead in modern design without squandering its traditions.

But except for three Southern states in which the religious right predictably exploited \\"Tales\\" for political ends, the series was not only broadcast without incident but served as an exceptionally potent tool for local station pledge drives.

The title, ''Taking Steps,'' may refer to the stairs on which the characters keep climbing and descending to outlying parts of the drafty, dusty old house that accommodates their frenetic comings and goings. Since James Morgan's witty set does not include any real stairs, the actors have to do a lot of pretending. Their running or ascending gag sets the footloose pace for the production, which, under Alex Dmitriev's snappy direction, keeps kicking up its heels.   The multistoried house is also a storied one. It is a former brothel, haunted, it is said, by one Scarlet Lucy. ''If she takes a fancy to you,'' one character tells another, ''she'll climb into bed with you.'' The downside is that the chosen gent will wake up dead in the morning. Need we say more about the plot?

Books about technical subjects for nontechnicians tend to be obtuse, condescending, or both. ''The Tower and the Bridge'' is neither. It is a clear, concise introduction to a difficult subject, and it is written with respect and even passion - something one rarely finds in a book with the word ''engineering'' in its title. David P. Billington is clearly moved by great structures - he means it when he says that major works of structural engineering are like the art of poetry, while architecture is the art of prose. What attracts him to poetry is its simplicity and economy - he sees no wasted words in its beauty, no superfluous phrases in its message. Critics of poetry may rightly differ with him, but no matter","excerpt":"the point is that Mr. Billington creates a set of standards for judging the great structures of the 19th and 20th centuries, and he applies them fairly and consistently. He admires most those works that bring beauty out of relatively spare physical form - the Eiffel Tower, Fazlur Khan's skyscrapers - and he has a good enough eye to distinguish between what is simple and elegant and what is simple and plain. If his point of view has any weakness, it is in its unwillingness to admit to the more complex beauty of what we might call ''dishonest'' structures, the sorts of buildings and bridges whose physical form does not reflect structural fact with absolute accuracy.

But she often seemed content to let works just drift along in the program she presented on Friday night as part of the Fiorello Festival, a four-week series of dance events at La Guardia Concert Hall in the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan.   Ms. Becker's choreographic patterns were especially attractive in her company's premiere of \\"Weaving,\\" which she created last year at the Yard, an arts colony in Chilmark, Mass. June Balish, Akiko Ko and Kalya Yannatos circled one another to recorded music by John Adams. When they neared, their arms meshed in sculptural formations.   Ms. Becker also devised striking poses in \\"Naming,\\" a new duet to a vocal score by Tiye Giraud that was sung by some of the troupe's dancers. The many intricate ways in which Ms. Becker and Anthony Phillips clung to each other made the beginning of the piece a kinetic haze. As clear shapes emerged from this blur, the choreography became increasingly repetitive. Because \\"Naming\\" is only a fragment of a work in progress, it is impossible to say whether Ms. Becker was emphasizing or merely belaboring her points.    Repetition was decidedly a problem in \\"Prayer,\\" a new solo to music by Dvorak, in which Ms. Becker's agitated movements were followed by attempts to achieve serenity. These calms kept giving way to other storms. Yet there was no sense of an continuing spiritual struggle. One type of movement simply alternated with another.    The program also included two works from the company's repertory. The bendings and swayings of elephants were the inspiration for \\"Kindred,\\" to a score by Ms. Giraud. All too soon, the dance grew lumbering. Although the work \\"Branching Waters\\" had pleasant swirling sequences, the choreography was ultimately swamped by the first movement of Rachmaninoff's imposing Piano Concerto No. 3, which served as its accompaniment.

He loved his family and had many friends whom he managed to incorporate into his life. His aunts, Joy Cunningham, Fern Cunningham and Sheila Hazel who were very close to Sergeant Ferguson said ''Keith was our son too.''

POLAND SAYS IT 'WOULD LIKE TO END' GOVERNMENT BY MILITARY BY FEB. 1"},{"year":"1969","title":"\\"LA FEMME INFIDELE,\\" which opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie, tells the story of a happy family that is somewhat upset when the husband murders his wife's lover but ultimately finds a yet richer harmony in the wife's new respect for her husband's initiative and prowess. In concept and execution, it is a film so calmly and thoughtfully perverse that it can have been born only in the unique cinematic imagination of Claude Chabrol.Claude Chabrol (\\"The Cousins,\\" \\"Leda,\\" \\"Les Bonnes\\") is a highly intelligent French New Wave director who, because he works in conventional forms (most of his movies are murder stories) has never excited the dedicated following that has maintained interest in his colleagues Godard and Truffaut. When he needed to, he made spy thrillers for money — and his commercial films look almost as personal as his art films. With \\"Les Biches\\" (1967), his reputation took a swing upward, at least in America, and \\"La Femme Infidèle\\" should establish him with audiences who may at last be open to what makes his vision strange and wonderful.Chabrol once filmed a modern version of the \\"Hamlet\\" story in which Claudius was innocent and the only person left both alive and sane at the end was Ophelia. He doesn't see things the way most people do. He sees the same things, and he often sees them better (the handsome suburban house and the Paris apartment in \\"La Femme Infidèle\\" offer fine lessons in traditional interior decorating—with deep browns and blues and muted yellow greens), but he sees them as odd.In the film, just before Charles (Michel Bouquet bops Victor (Maurice Ronet), his wife's lover, over the head with a weighty little portrait bust, he discovers a keepsake on Victor's night table. It is a giant Zippo pocket lighter that he had given his wife on a wedding anniversary (although he is the one who smokes — to incredible excess), and the sight of this huge grotesquerie actually brings tears to his eyes and impels him to fight for his marriage by eliminating Victor.For the most part, the world of \\"La Femme Infidèle\\" is resolutely good-looking. Chabrol fills his rooms with fresh flowers and with a sense of orderly livability. But the most subtle dislocations catch you up. The camera tracks with lyrical gravity—but with a little too much lyrical gravity, like a gesture so little in excess of the occasion that it would seem nearly perfect if you hadn't sensed that it was also slightly mad. Michel Bouquet, for example, plays Charles with great suavity and grace—except that he stares intently, and I do believe he is a trifle cross-eyed. And though he is the image of a man born to be cuckolded (like a French Herbert Marshall), he happens to have a pretty good time with his wife.So the plot of \\"La Femme Infidèle\\" makes even less sense than many Chabrol plots—which doesn't matter, because the meaning has less to do with sense than with sensibility. However, even in this context Charles's adventures in disposing of Victor's body (a long, entertaining sequence — and a tribute to Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\") move have no little to do with the case as to mislead the moviegoer temporarily as to the kind of film he is watching.But the moviegoer will be reassured when he returns his attention to the unfaithful wife herself. The actress is Stephane Audran, Chabrol's own wife, and she is beautiful, though a little ironic. She controls a sense of social parody so sustained that her simple \\"Bonjour\\" becomes a major critique of French language and civilizaton.Near the very end of the film, when she accidentally discovers that her husband has killed her lover, she destroys the evidence (no use","excerpt":"the police will come for him shortly) and then walks out to where he is working in his garden. As the camera travels with her, it watches in medium close-up while she composes the beginnings of a smile.The making of that smile, enigmatic and discreet, must count as one of the finest small passages in the history of cinema—and in the lovely, disquieting art of Claude Chabrol.

The man who fired the shot in 1981 that wounded the Pope, Mehmet Ali Agca, was convicted and threatened with incarceration in a jail where he would probably have been murdered by his former employers. He chose instead to sing and to stay in a safe jail, and his testimony is central in the current trial of Sergei Antonov, manager of the Bulgarian airline in Rome, who Agca says drove him to the site of the assassination attempt.   If a conviction persuades Mr. Antonov to cooperate as well, or if more information that implicates Bulgarian or Russian higher-ups is developed at this trial, most people will rightly interpret the results as the first judicial condemnation of an intelligence agency for plotting the murder of a world leader. In effect, the K.G.B. is on trial.  What makes this case even more disturbing is that the Bulgarian secret service - a servile appendage of the K.G.B. - undertook this murder attempt at a time that Yuri Andropov, later the leader of the Soviet Union and mentor of its present leader, was the K.G.B. boss.

In this way no President, no matter how ideological his appointments to the Court, could continue to exercise his influence long after he left office, a violation, I believe, of the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers.   Once such an amendment was added to the Constitution, there would no longer be any such thing as \\"the Warren Court\\" or \\"the Rehnquist Court.\\" Instead we would have a Supreme Court functioning as the Framers of the Constitution intended, far freer of politics than it is today, far more responsive to the evolving nature of our society and better able to handle the constitutional challenges that such a society engenders.

Data compiled by The Bond Buyer, the municipal-market chronicle, shows that state and local governments asked voters to approve more than $12 billion worth of projects, up 80 percent from the $6.68 billion of issues put to a vote in 1989. Only 59 percent, or $4.89 billion, of this year's issues passed, down from 85 percent, or $5.73 billion, lastyear.Among the major losers: environmental bond issues in New York and California.    Of course, much of the municipal market's new-issue volume these days consists of revenue bonds that are not backed by tax levies and do not require voter approval.

In fact, there are often many complex and overlapping considerations that underlie the decision to wait. These can include a marriage that turns out badly","excerpt":"the premature death of a spouse; economic and professional factors; or the need to provide care to an elderly or chronically ill relative. A woman may also elect to delay motherhood until she feels she has a better understanding of the strains and traumas of her own childhood, in an effort to minimize repeating similar problems with her child. While the author quotes friends who say \\"there's never a right time,\\" there are certainly times and situations that are better than others.   Cunningham suggests that the common good would be better served if resources and energies were withdrawn from fertility technology and redirected toward curing disease and providing for neglected and deprived children. It is misguided to pit the gaping inadequacies in medical and social care against the development of advances in fertility technology. These are two distinct issues. Furthermore, it is unfair to expect women who are coping with the personal tragedy of being unable to have a baby to necessarily choose adoption as an alternative. Choices as diverse as adopting a child from a foreign country or giving birth to quintuplets may be exactly right for one woman or couple, completely wrong for another.

Kennedy, and almost without realizing it found himself a member of a campaign in those early days when few people bothered to turn out for Kennedy appearances. Only slowly, he recalls, did he come to realize that \\"we\\" were running for President. The 1960 election won, J.F.K. asked Lowe to stick around and record his Administration. Given carte blanche to roam the White House, Mr. Lowe amassed, in the end, some 40,000 negatives of the Camelot years, what he calls \\"the most complete photographic record of any Administration in American history\\" in his selection of these shots, JFK REMEMBERED (Random House, $37.50). His commentary, witty and just a bit offbeat, accompanies stunning photographs, some familiar, some never before published. Mr. Lowe lends a new dimension to some of the era's most historic moments: the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Bay of Pigs discussions, the Paris meeting with Charles de Gaulle when the French leader used every ruse to keep the photographer away, the Khrushchev summit in Vienna with the Russian leader totally charmed by Mrs. Kennedy while the President looked miserable with Mrs. Khrushchev. Always at Kennedy's heels, the photographer was inevitably drawn into the private moments","excerpt":"the President insisted that Mr. Lowe take pictures of his daughter, Caroline, knowing that her mother did not want the children photographed.

Allport would begin his classes by showing two pictures: one of a black man unarmed, one of a white man holding a knife. After the lecture, he asked the class who had the knife.

But now some 25,000 farmworkers in a dozen developing countries -- Equador, Panama, Hondurus, Costa Rica, the Phillipines, Ivory Coast, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Burkino Faso, Dominica, St. Lucia and St. Vincent -- have brought suit against a group of American chemical  manufacturers and food growers, contending that the fumigant was used by American companies in the developing world for years afterward, without regard for the consequences.          The workers said they received little or no protective gear or warnings about the danger of DBCP, which the Environmental Protection Agency says may cause cancer and birth defects in humans. The growers named in the suit included Del Monte Fruit, Chiquita Brands and Dole Fresh Fruit. The manufacturers named -- Dow Chemical, Shell Oil and Occidental Chemical -- said that U.S. laws do not prohibit the export of pesticides banned in the United States, and that companies should not be judged by U.S. standards for their actions overseas.

THE BIGGEST SHOW ON EARTH -- The International Consumer Electronics Show opens Thursday in Las Vegas, and Bill Gates of Microsoft will start off the five-day event the night before with a speech on what he thinks lies ahead for consumer electronics. The show, the world's biggest technology trade exhibit, will occupy space equivalent to 28 football fields, according to The Associated Press. Participants will range from industry giants like Intel, which will unveil a new generation of multimedia platforms and chips, to mom-and-pop companies eager to display their wares. One event that is being trumpeted on the Web site of the Consumer Electronics Association, the extravaganza's sponsor, is not to be missed.

They also think the unemployment rate will either remain at 5 percent or slip to 4.9 percent. Construction spending figures for November (expected to rise 0.6 percent) and the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index (expected to fall to 57.1, from 58.1), will be released tomorrow. Factory orders for November (expected to rise 0.8 percent) and store sales for the last week of December will come out on Wednesday.

So more new-car buyers than ever before are getting a chance to buy this safety feature.   Automotive experts say the proliferation of these specialized braking systems - sometimes called A.B.S. - is likely to continue through the late 1990's, when antilock brakes are expected to become fairly common even on economy models.   Some insurance companies are granting discounts to clients whose cars have the brakes. Consumer advocates advise drivers who are shopping for cars now to make antilock brakes an important consideration.  A Helpless Feeling    The benefits of antilock brakes will be immediately evident to anyone who ever has had the experience of inadvertently braking too hard on a slippery road, only to encounter a frightening loss of control as the car careers or spins toward a possible collision. In this kind of situation, the wheels of the car, having been stopped by the brakes, remain locked while the car continues to skid. The steering wheel is useless: no matter which way it is turned, the vehicle continues to move in the direction it was moving at the moment the wheels were locked. Sometimes the car will turn sideways or begin to spin.   Driver-education courses warn against slamming on the brake pedal precisely because it is so easy to lock the wheels on a slippery surface because of the lack of friction between the rubber and the road. Students are taught that on wet or icy roads, they should repeatedly pump the brakes gently then quickly release the pressure until the vehicle slows or stops. The series of short braking actions reduces the chance of lockup.  Electronics Take Over     In essence, antilock brakes mimic those instructions, automatically applying and releasing pressure even faster than a driver could. As the brakes are applied, an electronic sensor detects when a wheel is about to lock and then releases it, overriding any pressure on the pedal. The driver retains the ability to steer the car and can depress the brakes as hard as possible without releasing pressure: the system will slow the wheels gradually without locking them. In some systems the driver can actually feel the pedal pulsing as the computer is applying and releasing the brakes.   The General Motors Corporation is installing antilock brakes as standard equipment in 20 of its 1990 models and will offer the system as optional equipment in 13 models. The most expensive Cadillac models will include antilock brakes, and so will sportier versions of the Pontiac Grand Prix and Buick Electra, as well as the Chevrolet Astro van. Buyers of the Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and other medium-sized models can pay $925 to receive them as an option.   For 1990, the Ford Motor Company has made antilock brakes standard on the Lincoln Continental, the Lincoln Mark VII, the Mercury Cougar and the Aerostar van, and some versions of the Taurus, the Thunderbird and other models. If ordered as an option, the brakes cost $924 to $1,085.   The Chrysler Corporation offers the system as standard on the Maserati TC, and as an option on the Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer, the Dodge Dynasty, Chrysler Imperial and Chrysler New Yorker for $926 to $998.   The brakes are standard on Acuras, and some Mazdas. Toyota, Nissan, , Mitsubishi and Subaru all offer them as an option on a varitety of models","excerpt":"the prices range from $995 to $1,495. They are standard on all BMW's, Jaguars and many models of Mercedes-Benz.   G.M., Ford and Chrysler also offer antilock brakes on many pickup trucks.   Like many advances in automotive technology, this one has been around for decades. It was first used on airplanes in the 1950's and in large trucks in the 1960's.   Only in recent years, however, have auto makers deemed the systems practical and economical enough for industrywide distribution. This follows the pattern of disk brakes, which were introduced in more expensive vehicles and, over time, became commonplace.   Josef Mack, a manager for the Robert Bosch Corporation, a leading making of antilock brake systems, estimates that 15 to 20 percent of the cars and trucks on the road will have them in the near future. \\"Since 1978 we have produced four million systems worldwide, and many consumers who have them say they'll never own another car without them,\\" he said.   At present, it is so complicated and costly to retrofit a car or truck with an A.B.S. that it is not practical.  Some Practice Needed     The brakes take a little getting used to. Deepak Dighe, a G.M. engineer, said pumping them, as many drivers been trained to do with stanbard brakes, will not take full advantage of the antilock technology.   Perhaps the greatest potential danger with respect to these systems is that they may imbue drivers with an undue sense of invulnerability when driving on wet or icy pavement.   \\"Antilock brakes improve controllability, but they don't necessarily reduce the stopping distance on slippery pavement,\\" Mr. Dighe said. \\"You cannot defy the laws of physics. It still takes longer to stop a vehicle on wet pavement than on dry.\\" - CONSUMER'S WORLD Antilock Brakes, Once Rare, Emerge as Prime Auto Option"},{"year":"2005","title":"FIFA, the international governing body for soccer, releases its last batch of 300,000 World Cup 2006 tickets on Dec. 12, offering a final chance to buy tickets to the games, held June 9 through July 9 in stadiums all over Germany.

The answer, in Bill Henderson's case, was from a card buried in Rudy Santin's Rolodex.   Santin, the Yankees' Florida-based scout, pulled that card with Henderson's Miami phone number, and tried his luck at dial-a-catcher on Tuesday afternoon.   \\"Been playing ball?\\" Santin asked.   \\"None at all, not for years,\\" Henderson said. \\"Sorry.\\"   Nothing to be sorry about, Santin told him. And less than 48 hours later, Bill Henderson, whose last play was a home-plate collision six years ago, was pulling up his pin-striped pants one leg at a time, just like Joe D., Mickey and the Babe.   This little tale from the crypt once known as the Yankee clubhouse should give you an idea of what's going on here, at the start of replacement spring training, which is a joke, \\"Star Search\\" on Broadway. If the Yankees had this much trouble assembling pitchers and catchers, they may soon be picking position players out of the telephone book.   \\"Some of these young men could earn positions in our organization,\\" said George Steinbrenner, repeating the line the Yankees obviously fed their pitchers, catchers and dreamers. \\"There might be some future star.\\"   Now, there is only one, and he was not in uniform this morning. After more than two decades of trying, Steinbrenner is finally the biggest of all the New York Yankees. There is no one around who could possibly upstage the Boss.   That's why journalists grabbed hold of him the moment he hit the field, and Steinbrenner refused to let go. \\"O.K, that's it,\\" he would say after a while. Then he'd move a few feet, and start talking all over again.   His new sultans of swat would pass by, look up at him with reverence and gratitude. Fans pushed their paper and pens in his face and peppered him with questions and advice. George signed. George bantered. George leaned across the rail and planted a kiss on the cheek of a young girl. A guy who looked just like Don Mattingly -- honest -- told him the players would soon crawl back.   \\"George, you've lost weight,\\" an elderly gent told him.   That he had. A few more pounds, and he might have been out there, jogging alongside the nobodies in the most famous uniform in American sports. \\"No, sir,\\" Steinbrenner said to that proposition. He is the owner. The players are the players, even if they are not the players.   So who were these guys and where had they come from? Some were from the Yankees' minor leagues, in career atrophy, hoping to score organizational points. The others were the unremorseful has-beens we've been reading about these past few weeks, fantasy leaguers on leave from life.   \\"I was between jobs,\\" said Bill Henderson, holder of a marketing degree. \\"My new job starts March 1. The boss said, 'Go for it.' \\"   Henderson, 26, once went for the money, right out of high school, as the Detroit Tigers' 1987 first-round draft pick. Two years later, in the Florida State League, he was bowled over in a play at the plate, a season-ending injury that sent him back to school, for good.   At least he didn't sustain a concussion. \\"He was out . . . I held on,\\" Henderson recalled.   I'll admit that I'm breaking my personal oath to refrain from this \\"I have a dream\\" replacement material that strikes me, depending on the moment, as unpalatable or preposterous. Couldn't help it, especially after the way Henderson answered the question of how much he missed baseball after last summer's strike.   \\"Actually,\\" he said, \\"I've always thought the baseball season was too long. By the time August comes around, I'm watching football.\\"   How's that for expert commentary on the state of the national pastime? It might even have stopped Steinbrenner, as he blabbed on at the top dugout step, about how much baseball is \\"interwoven into the American fabric,\\" and how in small Indiana towns, men sit around all winter \\"arguing who's better, Gehrig or Mattingly.\\"   Meanwhile, journalists were so interested in the first workout of Steinbrenner's replacement Gehrigs that they surrounded the owner, pushing closer until one newspaper reporter, tired of being elbowed from behind, suddenly began landing punches to the head of a stunned magazine photographer.   The reporter was so quick with his right that Steinbrenner yelled out, \\"Give that man a uniform!\\"   For once, the reporter could compare himself to the athlete and know he had a better job.

Unlike Pinocchio, Mia doesn't hang her wish on just any star; she hangs it on the movie-made promise that every girl can find her inner princess and, like, you know, rule. Directed by Garry Marshall, who's been selling wish-fulfillment fantasies for years, most notably in &quot;Pretty Woman,&quot; and written by Shonda Rhimes, &quot;The Princess Diaries 2&quot; combines a classic storybook scenario, in which the former ugly duckling refines her swan standing, with the usual self-help uplift.

Now, Diana, the Princess of Wales, is right up there with Amy Fisher as a multiple-movies favorite in what has come to be known as television's Trashomon Effect.   This portrait of Diana is, on balance, sympathetic, if only as compared with how everyone around her is portrayed. The opening scene shows an unhappy little girl wondering why her Mommy has left the family and dreaming of becoming a ballerina or princess one day. Little more than 10 years later, a teen-age Diana (Serena Scott Thomas) will find herself being wooed by the 30-year-old Prince Charles (David Threlfall).

When he visits a neighborhood clothing store, the proprietor presses him to accept an armful of shirts; the tacit understanding is that Rene will ignore the illegal aliens working in the shop.    As a 20-year veteran of the police force, Rene has long since settled into his familiar routine of free legs of lamb from the butcher, payoffs from the street hustlers working his territory, and daily tips on his real passion in life, playing the horses. But when he and his longtime partner bungle an off-hours heist, even though Rene manages to manuever his duller-witted buddy into taking the rap, Rene too must pay a price: he gets a new partner fresh from the police academy, an earnest young man whose idea of leisure-time reading is boning up on the penal code, every word of which he regards as sacrosanct.

A critical examination of Lawrence's work makes it possible to understand that by saying explicitly what Thomas Hardy only implied in ''Tess of the D'Urbervilles'' and ''Jude the Obscure'' -- that marriage is the heart of modern society, and sex is the heart of marriage -- Lawrence novels such as ''The Rainbow'' (published long before ''Lady Chatterley'') were almost certain to be suppressed. But that is a dry bone indeed, and antithetical to everything for which Lawrence lived. It was feeling he cared for, and the heart at which he aimed, not the loins that attracted Prose's attention as a teenager.     I suspect Lawrence would have clutched his head at the idea of anyone turning to biography as a way of finding ''new ways of understanding'' his work. Prose might have done better to glance at one of Lawrence's poems -- also titled ''The Rainbow,'' and probably not coincidentally. It closes with these radiant lines:     But the one thing that is bow-legged      and can't put its feet together      is the rainbow.     Because one foot is the heart of a man     and the other is the heart of a woman.     And these two, as you know,     never meet.

(It might, for instance, have pointed out that there is one all-powerful agent representing almost all the conductors who are considered for high posts.) Its most regrettable lack, however, was an apparent failure to understand exactly what is at stake. We are not speaking of mere performers to fill the job of conductor. These major orchestra posts require a music director. Those who hold such positions make repertory decisions that constitute a virtual death grip on orchestral music in the United States.   It should be obvious that music must be heard often enough to become familiar if it is to communicate. Under the current system, the imported conductor will do no more than pay lip service to American music (as John Rockwell has pointed out) by appointing whatever local university composer is the most astute musical politician to preside over a tiny pork barrel of underrehearsed performances. The tragic result is that whatever the motivations that cause a 20th-century American to compose, they can almost never be communicated to the audience, whose ears remain trapped in 19th-century Germany.   The conductors are rarely even well versed in European music: they are specialists in that small German corner of the repertory that they (rather like the religiously devout) have been taught to think is all that is of true worth. Riccardo Muti arrived in Philadelphia admitting that he knew nothing of American music, and, having scrupulously followed what might now be called the Rockwell formula for disposing of bothersome American works, he leaves the same way. This can hardly be a surprise, as he brought us no English music from his tenure in London either. Nor can he be entirely blamed","excerpt":"the problem is that he wasn't appointed to do any more than execute, albeit magnificently, the lessons he learned at the Berlin Hochschule.   Thus, when we speak of German or German-identified star conductors appointed to fill the post of music director, we are not speaking merely of a handful of their top-level American peers being deprived of rightful recognition. What is at stake is an entire population cut off from the deepest musical expressions of their own time and lives. HARRISON BOYLE  Philadelphia Trapped In Germany"},{"year":"2013","title":"Gary D.

On this team, Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O'Neal should take 70 percent of the shots. Coach Stan Van Gundy, and time, will have to make this hodgepodge of egos work. James Posey adds defensive toughness. Their preseason was dreadful, expectations are higher than ever, and time is already ticking. Still, the Heat has the most dynamic duo in the league.    PLAYOFF BOUND    2. INDIANA PACERS -- Losing Reggie Miller will hurt more in the locker room than on the court. Ron Artest is back after his 73-game trip to the corner, along with his paradoxical personality and ferocious defense. It is up to Jermaine O'Neal to lead this team, and to help reclaim what it could have had last year -- an Eastern Conference title. Point guard is still a      concern, although the 29-year-old rookie Sarunas Jasikevicius could be the wild card the Pacers need coming off the bench.    3. DETROIT PISTONS -- Flip Saunders is the team's main off-season acquisition, which means more offense and more Darko Milicic. As a coach, he has an unimpressive playoff record, but he has never had such a self-sufficient group. Larry Brown won't be there to harp on playing defense, or anything else, for that matter, and this team wants to prove it can win without him. Look for a fast start and experience to carry the Pistons.    4. NETS -- They have the best perimeter in the league with Jason Kidd, Vince Carter and Richard Jefferson -- an unstoppable group if the players remain healthy. The frontcourt is shaky, with the veteran center Marc Jackson and the willowy Nenad Krstic, who must keep soaring over the learning curve to give this team a chance to return to the conference finals.

Danny Ferry, the new general manager, had a terrific summer on paper, landing the free-agent guards Larry Hughes and Damon Jones. The Cavs are set for scoring, but center Zydrunas Ilgauskas must stay healthy. Players seem to be responding to Mike Brown, their rookie coach, but playing in the tough Central Division could hamstring the Cavs' record. So could their mediocre defense.    6. CHICAGO BULLS -- The loss of Eddy Curry and Antonio Davis in the middle will hit the team hard, but the Bulls did advance to the playoffs last season without Curry at the end of the season. Andres Nocioni's toughness may help offset their loss. This team is built around the backcourt, with Kurt Hinrich and Ben Gordon. But small forward Luol Deng, back after a wrist injury, could be the exciting X-factor.    7. WASHINGTON WIZARDS -- The team didn't want to ante up big dollars for Larry Hughes, a calculated gamble because the dynamic guard Gilbert Arenas and forward Antawn Jamison can pour in the points. Antonio Daniels was a good consolation prize in the backcourt. The concern is at center, now manned by Brendan Haywood and Etan Thomas. The Wizards won a first-round series last season, but seem unlikely to go further in the deeper East.    PLAYOFF BUBBLE    8. MILWAUKEE BUCKS -- The recent trade for center Jamaal Magloire makes this team a playoff contender, even if he does slow the club's pace. Magloire will bolster the team's presence in the paint and take pressure off the No.1 pick, center Andrew Bogut. The shooters Michael Redd and Bobby Simmons must prove they deserve their new big paychecks. T.J. Ford, back from spinal cord surgery, gives the Bucks a turbo boost, but he must stay healthy. Terry Stotts, the team's new coach, has to establish himself on the sideline.    9. KNICKS -- There are two sure-fire predictions anybody can make about Larry Brown, the team's new coach. His relentless coaching will get a team 10 more victories. And he will trade -- or at least try to trade -- most of the team's roster by the deadline. So long, Stephon. Eddy Curry better get in shape to play the right way. Brown may start longing for his days with the Clippers.    10. PHILADELPHIA 76ERS -- Any team with Allen Iverson is hard to count out. But Chris Webber is also on this team and the 76ers' future hinges on his fragile knee and psyche. Samuel Dalembert and Andre Iguodala form a solid core around the ever-dangerous Iverson, but Maurice Cheeks, the new coach and a former Sixers great, will not be immune to the Philly boo birds.    LOTTERY BOUND    11. BOSTON CELTICS -- Paul Pierce's days are numbered in Boston as the Celtics regroup behind younger players, starting with Al Jefferson. The lack of an established point guard makes them directionless.    12. ORLANDO MAGIC -- Grant Hill is out for six weeks with a sports hernia, and even he knows that sounds like a broken record. It's up to power forward Dwight Howard, a second-year rebounding marvel, to keep improving and make this team interesting, if not competitive.    13. ATLANTA HAWKS -- They went to the wall to sign Joe Johnson, even if he is not a great fit. This team is still years away from making the playoffs. Sadness over the death of Jason Collier could carry over into the season or motivate the players.    14. TORONTO RAPTORS -- Who goes first, Coach Sam Mitchell or General Manager Rob Babcock? Jalen Rose is on the block, but perhaps Chris Bosh begs to go before them. Hockey is back in Canada, and it's as if basketball never existed.    15. CHARLOTTE BOBCATS -- They have a sparkling new arena, but the product is still shaky. Drafting the North Carolina products Raymond Felton and Sean May did not exactly upgrade the talent around Emeka Okafor.    Western Conference    TITLE CONTENDERS    1. SAN ANTONIO SPURS -- They're so good on and off the court, the defending champions should be in their own league. Witness their upgrades: the shooter Michael Finley and point guard Nick Van Exel, drawn to the casual coattails of Tim Duncan and the spoils of a dynasty in progress. Manu Mania still rages, but Manu Ginóbili now has an Argentine Olympic teammate, forward Fabricio Oberto, to join him. Coach Gregg Popovich will deal with new depth and fewer minutes with his typical military humor. The Spurs win again behind Duncan and Ginóbili.    2. DENVER NUGGETS -- A young, deep, speedy, easygoing but extremely confident team. After George Karl took over as coach, the Nuggets took off, going 32-8 and winning 25 of their last 29 after the All-Star Game break. Carmelo Anthony has trimmed the fat, while Kenyon Martin, Marcus Camby and Nene provide a fast and formidable front line. The 3-     point shooter Voshon Lenard is back. The only potential problem is a crowded backcourt, with Andre Miller, Earl Boykins and Earl Watson.    PLAYOFF BOUND    3. PHOENIX SUNS -- Last season's run-and-gun darlings will take a step back while waiting for Amare Stoudemire's knee to heal. Stoudemire should be ready to rejoin the team for its playoff warm-up. Steve Nash, the league's reigning most valuable player, will keep the team afloat. So will Shawn Marion. At center, the former Knick Kurt Thomas provides much-needed defensive rebounding, but not blistering speed. Boris Diaw, a versatile 6-foot-9 guard, might be the sleeper acquisition.    4. HOUSTON ROCKETS -- Up-tempo from Coach Jeff Van Gundy? The newly acquired point guard, Rafer Alston, can establish that pace if he can keep his mouth idling and play some defense. The rangy power forward Stromile Swift could be the X-factor on this deep team, providingathleticism and shot blocking. Yao Ming, tremendous in the half court, keeps improving. Tracy McGrady was devastated to go out in the first round of the playoffs once again, and that will not happen this season.    5. DALLAS MAVERICKS -- Dirk Nowitzki will build on his M.V.P.-like season, assuming even more leadership in Michael Finley's absence. Jason Terry improved as a shooting point guard in the playoffs last season. Coach Avery Johnson made it clear that defense was going to be the team's emphasis. Doug Christie helps Josh Howard in that area, but Erick Dampier is still a major concern in the low post. The talent is too deep in Texas alone for the Mavs to break through.    6. MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES -- Veterans, grizzled and motivated, join Coach Mike Fratello's quiet team. Eddie Jones and Damon Stoudamire complement the surging Pau Gasol. Memphis has good depth at every position except the critical one: center. Jake Tsakalidis has more of a physical presence than Lorenzen Wright did. General Manager Jerry West is giddy about his team, which should raise eyebrows.    7. GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS -- After Baron Davis arrived via trade last season, he sparked the Warriors to an 18-10 finish, giving them hope for this season. If he is healthy, he is unguardable, creating a potent backcourt with Jason Richardson. Adonal Foyle may block shots, but he is offensively challenged at center. The Warriors hope that the rookie post player Ike Diogu progresses, but Davis is the key to making this team the surprise of the West this year.    PLAYOFF BUBBLE    8. SEATTLE SUPERSONICS -- Last season, Ray Allen led a stunning charge for a cohesive group looking for contracts. Coach Nate McMillan's defection to Portland and Antonio Daniels's exit to Washington are key losses, as is Jerome James's departure. Vitaly Potapenko is not the answer at center, nor is Danny Fortson. Bob Weiss, the new coach, must install defensive discipline quickly.    9. SACRAMENTO KINGS -- They picked up Shareef Abdur-Rahim when the Nets were unwilling to take a long-term gamble on his knee. Mike Bibby and Peja Stojakovic, together with center Brad Miller, make for a sturdy team. The addition of Bonzi Wells could stir the locker room chemistry of a team that sometimes seems to lack direction.    10. MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES -- Kevin Garnett is so smooth, but who is there to surround him? The rookie Rashad McCants is still a mystery, Wally Szczerbiak can be a thorn in the side, and Marko Jaric is unproven at point guard. Michael Olowokandi still doesn't get the team concept. Dwane Casey, the new coach, will try to bring defense to a troubled roster.    LOTTERY BOUND    11. LOS ANGELES LAKERS -- Phil Jackson declared that his return would not be a panacea. Neither is Kwame Brown. Nor is Smush Parker. Lamar Odom is an anchor, and Kobe Bryant could have an M.V.P. season, but by the time his teammates grasp the triangle, Bryant will be grasping the ball for himself. Jackson will be meditating come lottery time.    12. UTAH JAZZ -- Andrei Kirilenko is healthy again, as is Carlos Boozer. Matt Harpring bolsters the veteran roster. The rookie guard Deron Williams might come along slowly, but the Jazz will definitely improve this season.    13. LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS -- Sam Cassell and Cuttino Mobley have resurfaced here. Including Elton Brand and Corey Maggette, there are not enough basketballs to go around. Shaun Livingston's back injury hurts.    14. PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS -- Nate McMillan, the new coach, has his work cut out as camp counselor for the greenest team in the league. Sebastian Telfair and Jarrett Jack overlap at point guard, and Zach Randolph's talent is often confounding.    15. NEW ORLEANS/OKLAHOMA CITY HORNETS -- The Oklahoma fans are signing up for tickets in droves, but what is there to see? Chris Paul and an unhappy new arrival, Desmond Mason, will try to play for a barebones operation.

Now, with more than a month of stock trading in the huge oil exploration company behind it, the City of London - Britain's Wall Street - hasn't the slightest reason to temper that assessment.   Britoil shares hit the market priced at 100 pence, equal to $1.60, and finished the first day at 82 pence, or $1.30. They then dropped to 64 pence, or about $1.02, and closed Friday at 60 pence, or 97 cents, a record low. The kindest thing analysts can say about them is that it is possible to argue that they haven't performed worse than other oil exploration stocks.
