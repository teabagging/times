As a matter of fact, this final rendering, which Mr. Welles directed and in which he stars, may not possess the searching insight and the dramatic clarity that one might desire but it has a great deal in its favor in the way of feudal spectacle and nightmare mood.In the established Welles tradition, which has been building for a number of years, the theatrical mechanics of the medium are permitted to dominate the play and Shakespeare is forced to lower billing than either the director, the star or the cameraman. On weird sets, concocted by Fred Ritter, which cause the castle of Dunsinane to look less like a Scottish castle than like some sort of chasm or cave and the blasted heath of the witches to look like a bath of live steam, Mr. Welles deploys himself and his actors so that they move and strike the attitudes of tortured grotesques and half-mad zealots in a Black Mass or an ancient ritual.Especially does Mr. Welles favor the pointing of the camera at himself from all sorts of distorting angles and in close-ups that make his face bulk large. Also he uses heavy make-up to darken and crease his countenance so that his Macbeth, much given to pondering, has a monstrous quality. Except that he offers the suggestion that this fatally ambitious man took rather heavily to drinking in the later phases of his bloody career, he accomplishes no illumination of the classical character.And speaking of illumination, there is precious little of it in this film, either in the way of mere set lighting or in revelation of character. The Lady Macbeth of Jeanette Nolan is a pop-eyed and haggard dame whose driving determination is as vagrant as the highlights on her face. Likewise, her influence upon Macbeth, while fleetingly suggested in a few taut lines and etched in a couple of hot embraces, is not developed adequately. The passion and torment of the conflict between these two which resides in the play has been rather seriously neglected in this truncated rendering.But then Mr. Welles implies frankly in a spoken foreword to the film that his is a study of the tensions, the political conflicts and the religious troubles of an ancient time. And the whole purpose of his production seems to be to create the vicious moods, the ruthlessness and the superstitions of the warriors in Scotland in Macbeth's day. Although there are some empty spaces and general vagueness in aligning details, the moods and the dark, oppressive horrors of a people and an age are well displayed.Alan Napier plays a holy father as a grim, unrelenting militant, wearing a shaggy mop of coarse hair and two long, anomalous braids. Macduff is performed by Dan O'Herlihy as a grief-wracked, inarticulate man and a large cast of others look much better than they speak in subsidiary roles.It is notable that Mr. Welles has borrowed from Sir Laurence Olivier the device of letting his voice speak some of the soliloquies while his lips do not move. This is not near as effective as it has been in Sir Laurence's Shakespearean films, mainly because the predominance of Mr. Welles' countenance obtrudes. He has obviated that, however, in the \\"Tomorrow and tomorrow—\\" soliloquy","excerpt":"while speaking this one, he has simply trained the camera on ominous clouds.

But Hamilton spoke more clearly and to the point than that:    In No. 69 of The Federalist, Hamilton explains that \\"the power of the President will resemble equally that of the king of Great Britain and of the governor of New York\\" in a great many areas.   But there were also \\"most material points of difference,\\" particularly on war making: \\"The President is to be commander in chief of the army and the navy of the United States. In this respect his authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces, as the first general and admiral of the confederacy","excerpt":"while that of the British king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies -- all which, by the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the legislature,\\" that is, to Congress.   President Bush has many opponents of his policy in the Persian Gulf crisis, but as the polls show, he has more of the public in support.    If the Bush Administration continues to pervert the clear meaning of the Constitution and to claim that it can engage in an offensive war as a matter of Presidential prerogative, that support will shrink drastically by loss of those who value the constitutional requirements on the role of Congress and against an imperial presidency in war-making even more than they want to defeat Saddam Hussein.

For the notion appears to be widespread that the essential drama here is in a clash between Roman Catholicism and Communist ideology.While the proud and determined padre undoubtedly typifies a man of rigid devotion to the established disciplines of the Church and the Mayor is patently symbolic of the comradeship of the working class","excerpt":"while the cross and the hammerand-sickle are frequently juxtaposed and there is some occasional discussion of social obligations and attitudes, the essential complication out of which humor and humanity flow is simply a tangle of the natures of two stubborn peasants in a village on the Po. And the moral is not the triumph of either, but the evident brotherhood of both.When the Communists celebrate their victory with a noisy rally in the village square, the priest tries to drown out their ranting with a tintinnabulation of the church bells. And when the Mayor tries to stop the bell-ringing, the priest, his old comrade-in-arms during the war in the resistance movement, joyfully slugs it out with him. Likewise, the two stalwart rivals battle heroically and long over who shall first give a recreation park to the people.Withal, when the local landowners force the underpaid peasants to strike, the priest speaks up for the latter, at the cost of being called a \\"Communist,\\" and he secretly joins with the Mayor in milking the poor, untended cows. When a couple of star-crossed young lovers attempt to commit suicide, he rallies the villagers to their rescue and makes their families permit them to be wed. And when the old boy is finally directed by his bishop to leave the town, he receives a warm and loving send-off from his old friend, the Mayor, and the \\"reds.\\"This may not be wholly realistic in its picture of the state of affairs in Italy today, and it is certainly not without a clear tracing of strong idealism and sentiment. But its confidence in human goodness, regardless of politics, is inspiring, at least and its candid display of contradictions in words and deeds makes for good, healthy fun.Much of the charm of the picture is due to Fernandel, who plays the priest with explosive gusto and infinite alteration of moods. His Don Camillo is a horse-faced bumpkin, just this side of a hiph-class clown. and his grotesqueries are outrageous, but his spirit is plainly generous and warm. Even the private conversations the priest holds with his God in the church are played by Fernandel with credibility and are staged with simplicity and restraint.Signor Cervi is no less artful as the barrel-chested Mayor who maintains his dignity and his authority as the temporal spokesman for the people of the town. His pompous and taciturn nature is a fine foil for the flaring violence of the priest. And Sylvie. as an old school teacher; Vera Talqui, as a patrician girl, and Franco Interlenghi, as her Communist suitor, are strong among the other village types.There may be guileless simplicity and calculated comedy in this folk tale, but, thanks to M. Duvivier and all his company, it makes up into a cheerful and wholesome film.

The opening image is that of the narrator in tight close-up, scowling furiously as he describes the process of electrocution. Moments later, we see this same young man at a family dinner, sounding no less bitter or sarcastic as he quarrels with his younger sister, who is herself equally enraged. It's a daunting beginning, at the very least. Any audience is bound to be uneasy in the presence of such an abrupt outburst of anger.    Rage is at the heart of ''Daniel,'' a film about children whose parents have been executed on political charges, and whose story bears unmistakable resemblances to the controversial Rosenberg case. The rage exists on both the personal level, since the two young principals obviously feel greatly aggrieved, and on a broader political plane","excerpt":"while the film avoids explicit evidence as to the guilt or innocence of the executed couple, it expresses enormous outrage over their fate.

Its 260 rooms are in a 41-story tower joined to the restored century-old Williams Building and sharing space with the striking Museum of the African Diaspora, which opens onto Mission Street with a three-story glass wall. The hotel joins a luxury market already occupied by the Four Seasons, Fairmont, Ritz-Carlton and Mandarin Oriental. Elias Assaly, the general manager for the St. Regis, also opened the neighboring W San Francisco seven years ago (both brands are owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts). The contemporary-with-character interior design isn't terribly surprising","excerpt":"while the lobby's showpiece is a 16-foot-long open fireplace, it is powered by gas, and other than the three commissioned public art pieces outside, the wall sculptures and tastefully framed drawings within don't compete with the cutting-edge pieces at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art next door.    THE LOCATION -- Third and Mission was once the city's skid row, but it's pretty well-heeled now. It is a short walk to the Montgomery Street BART and Muni station, within walking distance of the modern art museum, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the Sony Metreon mall and the Union Square shopping district, as well as a good selection of galleries, clubs and independent bookstores.    THE ROOMS -- My deluxe room was done in a neutral palette, with dark wood doors, white Pratesi linens, pillowtop mattress and a cream-colored chaise positioned by the windows with views of downtown. It was the first hotel room I'd visited in which everything -- including motorized curtains, room temperature, lights, alarm clock and do-not-disturb light -- was controlled by a touch-screen phone on the nightstand. Recessed closets, along with the CD/DVD player and minibar, were concealed behind wall panels, though a 42-inch flat-screen television sat front and center on the wall across from the bed.    THE BATHROOMS -- A deep soaking bathtub with shuttered doors opened through to the bedroom. There was also a separate fogged-glass shower stall with a rain shower head, a toilet hidden behind sliding doors, and a large mirrored vanity lined with Acqua di Parma bath products. The best amenity: the exceptionally soft Cypress terry towels and robes.    THE CROWD -- The split seems even between leisure and business travelers (the Moscone Center convention hall is nearby). The lobby lounge and bar is a popular congregating spot for well-dressed people in their 30's on art pilgrimages.    AMENITIES -- A 3,700-square-foot private gym -- a full selection of cardio equipment features built-in LCD televisions -- has iPods for guest use, a yoga room, a stretch station with mats, and a weights area. The 9,000-square-foot spa is open for business on the sixth floor, and the lap pool and whirlpools are scheduled to open at the end of this month. A business center is in the lobby, as is a concierge. Wireless high-speed Internet access is available throughout the hotel for $14.95 a day.    ROOM SERVICE -- Available 24 hours. A breakfast order of eggs Benedict, coffee and toast arrived in 26 minutes. Delivery charge is $3, and an automatic service charge of 20 percent is added. Guests can also breakfast at Vitrine, on the fourth floor; lunch and dinner are served at Ame, the lobby-level New American restaurant run by Hiro Sone and Lissa Doumani of Terra restaurant in St. Helena.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- St. Regis is known for excellent service, and it's refreshing to see the century-old brand arrive in California with a more up-to-date, if still restrained, look. If you can afford it, a stay here won't disappoint. Doubles start at $399 through March, and then $529.

The neighborhood was established in the late 1800's, when the Anglesea Railroad, now defunct, used to stop nearby.

Since then the act has become a potent if controversial weapon in cases of fraud against Government agencies. By forbidding companies from firing whistleblowers and offering employees who come forward with information about wrongdoing up to 30 percent of any money the Government recoups, the act has sparked more than 300 lawsuits, many of them against military suppliers.

The new petunia is derived from a purple variety in which the gene producing the purple pigment has been turned off. The importance of the invention, company officials say, is that the underlying technology can be applied to block genes in other plants. Plums could be made to produce less sugar and peanuts to produce less oil.    The technique consists of identifying the gene responsible for a particular process, duplicating it and then adding the twin to the original plant. For reasons that remain unclear, the two genes tend to cancel each other out.    Richard A. Jorgensen and Carolyn A. Napoli, two former researchers at the company, received patent 5,034,323.
