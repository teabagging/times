Now in her mid-50's, she has been exhibiting for 25 years, though only fairly recently have midcareer laurels begun to be thrown in her direction.    One of them took the form of a survey titled \\"Joan Snyder: Works With Paper,\\" which opened at the Allentown Museum in Pennsylvania last fall and now appears, in a radically slimmed-down version, at Hirschl & Adler Modern. Actually, slimmed-down understates the case. Of the 50-odd paintings and prints at Allentown, only 15 appear here, packed into a small, difficult space. Under the circumstances, it is no surprise that the work, which spans two decades, doesn't get a chance to build and interact the way it can when seen in bulk and that her astonishingly versatile use of paper as a medium is incompletely explored.

These are personal, urgent compositions, many written, we now know, for friends and colleagues who understood the composer's double life: his public front of acquiescence and servitude toward the Soviet Government, shadowed by his private self, who undercut celebratory declarations with dark and bitter irony. The quartets are full of formal compositional tricks -- canons and double fugues -- along with soulful folk songs and robust circus numbers. They are Classical in spirit, almost transparent in their structure, yet are tortured and intricate in their overlapping emotions. They dance and grimace and sometimes seem to talk. There are times, too, when they create sounds and sensibilities that seem beyond ordinary description.   So when the Manhattan String Quartet began a seasonlong, chronological traversal of this cycle at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center on Monday night, I joined the sold-out audience with high expectations.

For $150 a year, this Colorado Springs, Colo., company will manage your airline, hotel and car rental programs, keeping track of all the points you've accumulated. It will post them to your account, send you a consolidated monthly statement showing what you have available and correspond with vendors to clear up any disputes. It will also act as travel agent to book vacations using any miles or credits you have, coordinating airline and hotel packages. Its publications tell you about promotions and give tips on accumulating miles.    The company operates in a rather protected niche.

Yet \\"One-Way Ticket\\" possesses a really skillful physical production, has freshness and individual style, and emerges as a considerably more likable photoplay than you might suspect from a brief digest of its story.Peggy Conklin brings talent and personal loveliness of a high order to the film, and, with the excellent assistance of Lloyd Nolan and Walter Connolly, is vastly helpful in concealing its dramatic frailties.No doubt you are beginning to get the idea that the scenario is less than a masterpiece, and it is now time to play a dirty trick on \\"One-Way Ticket\\" by attempting to tell what it is all about. An unruly young man turns Robin Hood and robs a bank of the precise amount that his father had lost some time before, when the institution crashed. He is caught and sent to prison, where he comes into contact with Mr. Connolly, the head keeper, and his daughter, Miss Conklin. Somehow the convict and the keeper's daughter contrive to fall in love, and when he escapes she joins him. Trapped by the police in the apartment where they are living, the youth tries to shoot his way out, but the girl foils his escape so that he may go back to prison and earn his freedom.Mr. Nolan and Miss Conklin play with such charm and conviction as to make this fabulous romance seem surprisingly real, and Herbert Biberman, the director, tells the story with a shrewd feeling for cinema values. Mr. Biberman constantly enhances the effectiveness of dramatic scenes by his use of black and white and his gift for excitement and tenseness. This is particularly true of the police trap, which is played out in a dead silence that is electrifying.Miss Conklin has an immensely engaging quality of tremulous girlishness about her, and she registers far more effectively here than she did last year in \\"The President Vanishes.\\" You associate her naturally with pleasant, oddly exciting things: clear sunlight and the clean, fresh water of mountain streams. She is the perfect antidote after too many hours with the conventional glitter girls.

The proceeds of this screening will swell the United States Olympic Fund, which is also pleasant to contemplate.But the astute writing-producing-directing team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat has relied largely on occasional Scottish gags and chuckles to support a fragile story. Their saga of \\"Wee Geordie,\\" the gamekeeper's son who grows up to be a giant and Britain's Olympic hammer-throwing champion, is gently satirical but not nearly as tall and weighty as its hero.It must be said, however, that they have used remarkable restraint in capturing the reactions of the sensitive, tiny youngster to the taunts of his schoolmates. And they neatly rib the physical culturists as Geordie, in subscribing to a newspaper ad, attempts to grow the muscles of a blacksmith by studiously applying himself to the instructions (narrated off-screen) by \\"Professor Samson.\\"That Geordie will develop into a behemoth—even without the \\"Professor's\\" blue-prints—is a foregone conclusion. That he will capture the Olympic crown and the lassie of his heart is also fairly obvious.As a matter of fact, the plot offers few surprises but the thin story line is bolstered by some charming regional dialogue and a few funny scenes. More important, Technicolor has been used with artistry to illuminate the pastel shades of green glens and woodlands, deep-blue lakes and mist-shrouded mountains. Some color footage of Melbourne and a former Olympics give \\"Wee Geordie\\" topical travelogue distinction.Bill Travers, who may be remembered for his performance in \\"Bhowani Junction,\\" is ideal in the title role. As the gentle brute, whose heart is in the highlands, he is properly hulking, dour and succinct. Being a man who once traveled to Perth and didn't like it, he is only mildly appreciative of England and Australia. And, though he is importuned by a large Danish lady athlete, his mind is on the girl he left behind him.Alastair Sim, who apparently can do no wrong, has his moments as the \\"laird\\" of the estate on which our hammer-throwing gamekeeper labors. A typical bumbling squire, he fusses and fumbles appropriately. Norah Gorsen makes a vigorous, pert and pretty romantic partner for Mr. Travers, and Doris Goddard, as the Scandinavian Circe who tempts our hero, and Miles Malleson, as the foggy, \\"Colonel Blimp\\"-type head of the Olympic squad, add a few humorous bits to the goings-on.\\"Wee Geordie,\\" by the way, tosses the hammer more than 200 feet for a record. The actual top mark is a trifle more than 185 feet. \\"Wee Geordie\\" isn't that good.Also on the program, is \\"The Bespoke Overcoat,\\" a thirty-seven-minute drama written by Wolf Mankowitz from a story by Gogol. It was directed by Jack Clayton and stars David Kossoff and Alfie Bass.The film, which won prizes at both the Venice and Edinburgh Film Festivals, treats of the ruminations of both a poor brandy-bibbing tailor (Mr. Kossoff) and his late pal, a clerk for a wholesale clothier (Mr. Bass), whose ghost, the tailor imagines, has risen from the dead.Although the subject is supernatural and has been done in flashback style, it has tender, fey and occasionally poetic qualities enhanced by Mr. Kossoff's sensitive performance.

The designs and devices of the youngsters in thumbing and stealing rides by railway, bus and bicycle up to the city to see Elizabeth-crowned are either too sharp or too artless for children of 12 and 6. And the ways in which the author, William Fairchild, extricates them are too convenient.More than that, the adults in this whimsey seem an acid or saccharine lot. None of them seems precisely normal. And much of the sentiment is scooped up in clichés.For instance, it is a streetwalker who finds the little girl when she gets lost in London the night before the Coronation, takes her in hand and watches sweetly and poignantly over the sleeping child. And it is no less than a field marshal who commands that the youngsters receive a police escort and a vantage position atop the Marble Arch from which to watch the Coronation parade.But, for all this, there is something cheerful and heart-warming about this little film that makes it an attractive entertainment, especially toward the end. For one thing, the youngsters, Colin Gibson and Lesley Dudley, are likable tots—particularly the latter, a chubby, unruffled little girl. A sense of the mood of the spectators at the Coronation—the ones who just lined the curbs after waiting all night wrapped in blankets and singing songs—is very well caught. And the colorful, memorable footage of the Coronation parade is smartly and thrillingly woven into the climax of this film (all of which is in color, and right good color, too).Not much need be said about the adults. Moira Lister as the street-walker, Wilfrid Hyde White as the field marshal, Sidney James as the dad of the boy and Andrew Cruickshank as the youngster's uncle who rides a black horse in the Sovereign's Escort are fair. Their slightly absurd aberrations may be charged to Mr. Fairchild's script and direction.But Philip Green's musical score, which uses a lot of trumpet by Eddie Calvert, does lend a rather sportive and plaintive air to the whole thing that helps to make it more enjoyable.

To the right is not one, but two jars of Vegemite spread sitting on a shelf with miniature cereal boxes and condiments. Amid all this, though, Joseph DiBiase cooks away on an old six-burner stove, churning out Klondikes for his hungry blue-collar customers in cast-iron skillets. Mr. DiBiase, whose father, Carmine, opened Central Lunch in the same spot in 1928, gladly answers any questions you might have.     So, why is there a Klondike named after J.F.K. Jr.? He came into the restaurant one day in April 1994, after selling his vintage Karmann Ghia to a local garage. He ordered the signature sandwich -- a sloppy pile of ground beef, onions, potatoes and cheese that is only partly held back by an optional Kaiser roll -- but asked for lettuce and tomato on it. ''I wondered how he could eat it that way, because it was so messy,'' Mr. DiBiase said. ''But where there's a will, there's a way.'' Thus the Kennedy Klondike ($5) was born. The framed note next to the Klondike sign thanks Mr. DiBiase for his sympathy after Mr. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Onassis, died later that spring.

An essay by Peter Haiko, an architectural historian who teaches at the University of Vienna, provides a competent and accessible introduction to the historical events and theoretical issues for those unfamiliar with the architecture of the period. The heart of the book, however, is the fine color and black-and-white photographs of more than 30 structures documenting the metamorphosis of Vienna from a Baroque capital draped in the mantle of historicist styles to the stern, uncompromising forms of the modern city. In addition to civic and religious structures, the building types surveyed include private villas, apartment buildings and municipal structures like gasworks, water towers and bridges. Like the finest examples of human portraiture, Roberto Schezen's photographs reveal character as well as physiognomy. While his treatment of facades and major interior spaces conveys the public decorum and grand scale of urban architecture, his photographs of building details and eccentric spaces reveal intriguing facets of his subjects. Mr. Schezen possesses a wonderful eye for decorative details. The result is an unusually subtle and nuanced description of architecture. This photographic paean to Vienna vividly testifies to architecture's ability to transcend the requirements of mere shelter and evoke the spirit of an age and the character of a place.

A1    Colombian Extraditions Rising  President Álvaro Uribe of Colombia's government has extradited more than 170 drug trafficking suspects to the United States.

Daniels of Federal District Court in Manhattan is the king of delayed decisions, statistics show, with 289 motions in civil cases pending for more than six months, the most of any federal judge in the nation.

A1    A new dispute between Washington and Mexico erupted over Mexico's failure to seize $160 million the United States asserts was deposited in Mexican banks by a drug suspect. Mexican officials contended that the amount was misunderstood. A10     Clinton Heads to Helsinki   President Clinton departed for Helsinki, Finland, and a meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. United States officials hope Mr. Yeltsin will find the political cover he needs to accept a plan to expand the NATO alliance eastward.   A6     Egypt Warns Against Har Homa   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt warned that Israel's decision to build Har Homa, a Jewish housing project in East Jerusalem, could set off a new cycle of violence in the Middle East. In Jordan, King Hussein made a surprise move, choosing a Prime Minister seen as committed to warmer ties with Israel.   A11     Israeli Proposal Elicits No Trust   Israeli officials said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had revived a proposal to bypass interim steps of the Mideast peace accords and go straight to talks on a final settlement. They said that since Mr. Netanyahu had to extend so much political capital to get his right-wing supporters to accept each step, he might as well go all the way at once. The Palestinians rejected the notion as a ''media trick.''   A12     New Tuberculosis Treatment   Millions of lives could be saved through a tuberculosis treatment that has been used successfully from New York City to Tanzania, the World Health Organization said.

A5     Protests Over Polish Shipyard   Hundreds of laid-off workers in Poland chanted anti-Communist slogans in protesting the closure of the bankrupt shipyard in Gdansk where the Solidarity movement was born. The Government, whose refusal to guarantee loans to keep the shipyard afloat was seen by workers as politically motivated, blamed the Solidarity-led management for overemployment and excessive benefits.   A7   Italy Calls Refugee Emergency   Italy declared a national state of emergency that allows the immediate expulsion of Albanian refugees whom the Government deems undesirable. The decree was Italy's first comprehensive response to a crisis that has brought more than 10,600 Albanian refugees to its shores in the past week. The decree also called for at-sea inspections of boats carrying refugees and the seizure of any vessels that arrive in Italy.   (AP)     NATIONAL   A16-22, B10-13     Acting C.I.A.

Tenet, a career intelligence official who has been Acting Director of Central Intelligence since December, to take the job permanently. The Senate is expected to confirm him.   A1    New Facts on Hubbell Deal  Less than a week after the Indonesian businessman James T. Riady saw President Clinton at the White House in 1994, one of his companies paid $100,000 to Webster L. Hubbell, people familiar with the arrangement said. Mr. Hubbell, a friend of Mr. Clinton, was facing a criminal investigation, and investigators are trying to learn whether Mr. Clinton or other officials helped line up financial assistance for him. Mr. Clinton's lawyer said that neither the President nor his wife had asked anyone to hire Mr. Hubbell.   A1    Suits on Species Law Allowed  People can sue the Federal Government for doing too much, as well as too little, to protect endangered species, the Supreme Court ruled. The decision will allow developers to challenge Endangered Species Act restrictions.   B10    The Court heard arguments on whether the Government can regulate indecency on the Internet.   B10    Compensatory Time Wins Vote   The House voted to let employers give workers compensatory time off instead of paying them overtime. President Clinton has said he will veto the measure, and Democrats in the Senate may prevent a vote in that body.

Hoffa, who narrowly lost an election for president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, is trying to stop Saturday's inauguration of the winner, Ron Carey, left. Mr. Hoffa's group has asked a Federal supervisor to invalidate the election because Mr. Carey, the incumbent, had received donations from a woman whose husband's consulting firm had been paid by the union for a get-out-the-vote effort for November's Federal elections.   A16     San Diego Endorses Land Plan   The San Diego City Council approved a nature conservation plan that supporters say could be a national model for balancing the interests of preservationists and developers. The plan will set aside some undeveloped land as a permanent nature reserve and allow unrestricted development in other areas.   A16     More Backing for Mars Theory   Scientists said that months of chemical, mineralogical and magnetic tests had made them more confident than before about their suggestion that a meteorite showed evidence of possible life on Mars.   A22    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-9      Takeover of Lilco Promises Rate Cuts for Homeowners  A partial New York State takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company will cut electric rates by up to 23 percent and will give homeowners rebate checks averaging $100 to $232, Governor Pataki said.

A research group called it the toughest such policy in the country.   B1    3d Fire at Warehouse  A fire that officials believe was deliberately set swept through a warehouse in South Brunswick Township, N.J., that holds important records for thousands of companies. It was the third fire at the company's warehouses and forced the town to curtail its water use as firefighters battled the stubborn blazes.   B1    Simpler Court System Proposed  New York's Chief Judge proposed streamlining the state's nine categories of trial courts into two as a way to overhaul a court system that is among the most tangled in the country.
