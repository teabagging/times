However, some feel the search for flawless coins has given rise to badly flawed thinking.\\n\\nThey question the emphasis being placed by certain collectors and dealers on coin design elements that are, in their view, minor in importance. They scoff, for example, at Jefferson nickel collectors who pay substantial premiums for ''full-steps'' specimens, that is coins on which the steps in Monticello are fully struck. These questioners sneer at the prices being paid for ''split-bands'' Mercury dimes, dimes on which there is sharp separation between the bands encircling the fasces - the bundle of rods depicted on the coins' reverse.\\n\\nLatest in this series of perfectionist pursuits is the Franklin half dollar with ''full bell lines.'' This quest-for-the-best concerns two sets of lines near the base of the Liberty Bell, the central device on the Franklin coin's reverse. The lines, which encircle the bell, tend to be indistinct or absent on most specimens.

Illustrated. 547 pp. New York: The Free Press. $24.95. \\n\\nIN his precedent-setting opinion in the case of Irene Allen v. United States, Judge Bruce Jenkins, finding in favor of the plantiffs, held that ''in its conduct of open-air atomic testing, and its off-site radiation programs - including its public information activities - the government was bound by a legal duty to act with the highest degree of care in light of the best available scientific knowledge.'' The suit was filed in 1979 in the Federal District Court in Utah by 24 people, the first of almost 1,200 ''downwinders'' to seek remedial action for injury resulting from negligence in this country's conduct of nuclear weapons tests that released radiation into the atmosphere. That the question of a government's obligation to act responsibly in conducting nuclear tests concerns not only the past was evident at a recent meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency called to write a convention on early notification of nuclear accidents. Both the United States and the Soviet Union wanted to exclude from reporting requirements radioactive pollution from nuclear tests or accidents involving a nuclear weapon. SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY","excerpt":"Are We All Downwinders?"},{"year":"1990","title":"ON the molecular level, the ancient ontological question about chickens and eggs comes down to this: Which came first, amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) or nucleic acids (the components of DNA)? Self-replicating molecules of DNA and its cousin RNA carry the genetic code for stringing together amino acids to make proteins. But DNA and RNA can't reproduce or direct protein synthesis without the proper chemical catalysts. And those catalysts are none other than proteins. Adding to the confusion, some scientists doubt that the Earth's early atmosphere had the proper composition to promote the spontaneous formation of either kind of molecule.   Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA's structure, once proposed that organic molecules first developed in the methane-rich atmospheres of other planets and were seeded on Earth -- deus ex machina -- by aliens. According to a variation on this theme, the molecules arrived on colliding comets.   There are a number of problems with this last scenario. For one, it seems that the force of the collisions would have destroyed the molecules. It is also hard to imagine how an occasional collision could have provided enough seed molecules for life to take hold.   Last week scientists with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration suggested a solution. Writing in the journal Nature, Dr. Kevin Zahnle and Dr. David Grinspoon proposed how cometary dust with organic molecules could be \\"swept up by Earth, collected gently and nondestructively.\\" According to their theory, a huge disintegrating comet, trapped in the inner solar system, could have been raining dust onto the Earth for thousands of years. The particles would have been light enough to float down to the planet unharmed.

It even seemed that the exchange programs he initiated were imaginative and somewhat effective. That was until the Federation of New York State Rifle and Pistol Clubs Inc. came up with a truly imaginative program: bullets for guns -- 1,000 free rounds of ammunition in the caliber of your choice for each unregistered weapon turned in.   At first, this kind of exchange might not seem to make sense. But Gerald Preiser, federation president, says the problem is that drug dealers are not exchanging their semiautomatics for teddy bears. So they'll come in for the bullets? No, he doesn't want that either. In fact, Preiser wouldn't give criminals bullets. Not real criminals. You have to be a law-abiding criminal. His plan is to give free bullets to good people whose only unlawful act has been to own an unregistered gun. You do have to get a license and register the gun before you get the ammunition, a process the federation will help you with. Preiser's goal is not to get guns off the streets but to put them in the right hands and thus \\"raise the body count of criminals.\\" Preiser seems confident that more guns will mean more dead bad guys.

Where do you draw the line?     A. It's one thing to say this one is dating so-and-so or this one is pregnant. That's not hurtful. It's just kind of silly. It's what I used to talk about with my friends in college.   Q.    Who do people really want to hear gossip about right now?     A. They want to hear everything and anything about \\"Beverly Hills, 90210.\\" It's become a running joke between me and the MTV staff because every week I have something on the show's cast.    Q.    How has your life changed since you got the job last April?     A. The day I got MTV -- do you know what Doc Martens are?  [ They're shoes. ]  I went out and bought them. I figured I had to have them since everyone on the network seems to wear them.   Q.    Your mother does a lot of gossip on her show","excerpt":"are you competitive?     A. Not at all. My mother and I are so close and my father and I were so close. It was never my mother's career, it was    the    career. Everyone helped out, and now with me it's the same thing.    Q.    So are you planning to do stand-up comedy, like her?     A. No, I never would. That's asking to be punished.

Bentley's play was first produced at Yale, and then at the Riverside Church in New York, but the Los Angeles presentation is the first to have caught fire. Partly, this success is due to some fine acting and good direction and script editing by William Devane. What makes the Los Angeles production a special event, however, is that here the audiences include movie personalities who were either directly or peripherally involved in the HUAC hearings. Members of the Hollywood Ten &#8212; the group of writers and directors who went to jail for refusing to testify before the committee &#8212;have seen the play and been free with their comments afterwards.

VISITOR INFO: (800) 788-0836 or (559) 233-0836. www.fresnocvb.org . Fresno grew up around a train station established in 1872 for what became the Southern Pacific Railway. The city was incorporated in 1874. With the introduction of irrigation to the fertile San Joaquin Valley in the 1880's, the small city thrived at the center of a healthy agricultural economy. Today Fresno County is the number one producer of agricultural products in the nation—and the world—and averages more than $2 billion a year in the production and processing of 200 commercial crops, including grapes (for wine and raisins), melon, cotton, alfalfa, barley, grains, cattle, sheep, and poultry. Fresno's population grew 63 percent between 1980 and 1990, and in the 1980's it was the ninth fastest growing city in the United States and by far the fastest growing of the nation's 50 largest cities. Located in central California, Fresno—the name is Spanish for ash tree—is a gateway to the Sierra Nevadas, and it is less than 90 minutes from three national parks—Kings Canyon (55 miles), Sequoia (85 miles) and Yosemite (92 miles). Among the attractions to be found within the city limits are the Fresno Art Museum, the Fresno Zoo, the Kearney Mansion Museum (restored home of Theo Kearney, “Raisin King of California”), the Fresno Metropolitan Museum, and the Discovery Center. There are also 10 colleges and universities including a campus of California State University and Fresno City College.

Lithe and sultry, assertive and caressing, knowing and luxuriant, her singing melts down any divisions between gospel, soul, jazz and rock, bringing an improvisatory spirit even to the most cut-and-dried pop material. Her concert Wednesday at Radio City Music Hall, opening a three-night stand that is her first New York engagement since 1981, presented the singer as a glitter-swathed supper-club entertainer.

Bonnie Raitt, Smokey Robinson, Rod Stewart, Elton John, Gloria Estefan and P.M. Dawn joined Ms. Franklin in a benefit concert for Gay Men's Health Crisis, the AIDS organization. The actors Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro also appeared.   The concert was recorded for broadcast on May 9 on Fox. Despite delays and retakes that prolonged the event to four hours, the concert lived up to Ms. Franklin's magnificent voice. Her own recent tours have been frustrating teases, offering only hints of what she can do amid second-rate pop. Perhaps by adding competition, \\"Duets\\" brought out Ms. Franklin's improvisational genius. She can summon the agility of jazz, the pain of the blues, the sultriness of pop and the fervor of gospel, and while her voice is smokier now than it was in her 1960's heyday, she has all the range she needs.
