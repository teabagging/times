It was directed by Mr. Otto, who also plays one of its principal rôles.The picture is a melodrama with its scenes laid in Thibet and Western Europe. The action centres around Tantara Bagha, Prince of Thibet","excerpt":"Arnold Cooper, the Eastern, agent of a maritime corporation, and Eleanor Cunningham, Cooper's fiancee. While Cooper is in Thibet, Semena, the Prince's sister, is killed by a native conspirator against the throne, who succeeds in persuading the Prince that Cooper is the murderer. The Prince makes an oath of vengeance and follows Cooper to Europe, where he plans to kill his fiancée. But he falls in love with her instead and induces her to return to Thibet with him by the threat to have Cooper killed if she doesn't. Cooper, however, also goes back to Thibet, learns that he is supposed to be the murderer of the Princess, ascertains the truth, reaches the palace in time to stop the marriage of the Prince to Eleanor, convinces the Prince of his error, and is allowed to depart with his fiancée. The Prince, then, being the victim of wrongful vengeance and disappointed love, follows the tradition of his country and commits suicide.Outlandish as this story is, it has possibilities. There is material for the creation of an inherently human and impressively tragic figure in the Prince, and with this opportunity of characterization lost, there is still the chance for a thrilling melodrama. But \\"Tradition,\\" as presented on the screen, realizes hardly any of its opportunities. It is a crudely done picture.In the first place, almost no attempt has been made to rationalize the story. The Prince accepts an erroneous theory of his sister's death without any investigation. When Eleanor Cunningham is told that her fiance has killed the Princess she does not even ask him if it is true. And Wun-si, the villain who is daring enough to strangle a Princess of the Royal Family for some reason, or, rather, without any reason, refrains from killing an insignificant old servant woman, the one witness of his act whom he has cause to fear and who does, in fact, ultimately inform against him. These are only a few of the preposterous incidents of the photoplay that practically compel its rejection even by the mind willing to concede a good deal to a story of its kind.And the acting is entirely inadequate. Mr. Otto, as the Prince, is sufficiently vigorous, but he has slight pantomimic ability, and doesn't impress one at all as an Oriental Prince, Arthur Schroeder, as Cooper, and Lotte Klinder, as Eleanor Cunningham, lack the suggestion of fire or finesse, and Ralph V. Roberts, as the Villain, overacts to the point of burlesqué.Whoever wrote the titles for the American version of the picture apparently got the idea somewhere that the use of thee\\" and \\"thou\\" in the conversation of the Thibetans would give it the proper atmosphere, but it seems strangely inappropriate and becomes amusing when a \\"you\\" slips in beside the \\"thees.\\"The settings of the picture, though nothing amazing in this spectacular age, are its best feature, and the inherent strength of the story occasionally arouses a mild interest, but it would seem that only those who take their melodrama blindly can lose themselves in \\"Tradition.\\"Not every German director, apparently, is an Ernst Lubitsch, nor every star a Pola Negri or an Emil Jannings.\\"The Twice Born Woman\\" continues at the Hippodrome, and performances are now continuous from 1:30 to 11:30 P.

Some foods send forth such warm and luscious scents that they seem to be fattening even in the smelling and almost sustaining enough without being eaten. In Burgundy, I was told, there is a particularly fine and strong marc that true connoisseurs sniff but never drink. They pour a few drops into a large, warmed brandy snifter, then empty it and press faces into the glass to inhale the residual perfume, a subtler appreciation, they claim, than merely drinking the clear white firewater.   As for the feeling of security that food smells can instill, I once knew a woman who had a brief extramarital fling, with assignations that took place in the afternoon. Each day she would hurry home and begin sauteing onions, because, she said, if her husband came in and smelled the cooking, he would know everything was all right. That meant, of course, that each night's meal had to include a dish in which sauteed onions were appropriate, but that's the sort of challenge any resourceful cook welcomes.

They are widely available fresh in supermarkets and are fairly economical, especially for small families or couples who have no need to buy a whole bird for a holiday. Turkey breast is also an excellent low-fat source of protein.   The greatest challenge to many home cooks, whether they are cooking a whole bird or just the breast and ribs, is keeping the turkey moist. In the basic recipe here for roasted turkey breast with ribs, the breast is rubbed with lemon juice and vegetable oil and seasoned well before being placed in a 450-degree oven. The heat is reduced to 425 degrees after 30 minutes, and roasting continues for 25 minutes more, with frequent basting.    Wine and chicken broth are added for extra moisture and roasting continues for 10 minutes longer. It is important to let the turkey sit for about 15 minutes before carving.   The apple-sausage dressing is one of my favorites at this time of year.  Use the best grade of sausage you can find. I combine mine with onions, apples, celery, garlic, sage and other seasonings. The seasonings can be varied to suit individual tastes. For binding, I add a whole beaten egg, bread crumbs and chicken broth. This should bake about 30 minutes in the same oven with the turkey. Roast Turkey Breast With Ribs  1 fresh turkey breast with ribs, about 4 pounds  1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  1 tablespoon corn or vegetable oil  2 bay leaves  4 fresh sprigs thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried  4 garlic cloves, unpeeled  1 large onion stuck with 2 cloves  1/4 cup diced carrots  1/4 cup diced celery  1/2 cup dry white wine  1 1/2 cups fresh or canned chicken broth.   1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.   2. Sprinkle the turkey breast inside and out with lemon juice, salt and pepper, and then spread the oil over the top. Place the breast skin side up in a heavy roasting pan","excerpt":"around it, scatter the bay leaves, thyme, garlic, onion with cloves, carrots and celery. Cover with foil, put in the oven and bake for 30 minutes.   3. Reduce the heat to 425 degrees and remove the foil. Continue roasting for 15 minutes, basting every 5 minutes.   4. Remove the turkey breast from the roasting pan and pour off most of the fat from the pan. Return the breast to the pan, skin side up, and pour the wine and broth around it. Continue roasting for 10 minutes, basting.   5. Remove from the oven, cover with foil and let stand in a warm place for 15 minutes before carving. Carve and serve with sausage and apple dressing (see recipe) and the pan gravy.   Yield: 6 to 8 servings. Sausage and Apple Dressing   1/2 pound best-quality sausage meat  1/2 cup finely chopped onion  2 cups diced apple  1/2 cup diced celery  1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic  1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage, or 2 teaspoons dried  Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  2 cups coarse fresh bread crumbs  1/2 cup fresh or canned chicken broth  1 egg, beaten  1/4 cup chopped parsley  1 tablespoon butter.   1. Heat a nonstick skillet and add the sausage meat, stirring with a wooden spatula to break it up. Cook until lightly browned. Add the onion, apple, celery, garlic, sage, salt and pepper. Cook until vegetables are wilted, about 5 minutes.   2. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl. Add the bread crumbs, broth, egg, parsley, salt and pepper.  Blend well, checking the seasonings.   3. Butter a baking dish and put the dressing in it. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes in the oven with the turkey. Serve with the turkey.

Ellena -- currently the in-house perfumer at Hermès, but for years one of the hidden perfumers creating scents for other brands -- had an idea. Ellena had a success with his first real perfume, First for Van Cleef &#38","excerpt":"Arpels, a classic French fragrance launched in 1976 that was very much in the early-20th-century French style -- which is to say that First is a pastiche of Guerlain's Mitsouko (1919) with a slightly modernist simplification. It is, as Ellena says, \\"bourré des choses,\\" stuffed with the thick, plush, crushed red velvet and gold-leaf tropes of classic French perfume. Van Cleef had directed him toward this, which is the way virtually all perfumery used to work. But by 1989, Ellena says, he felt strongly that \\"it was time for me to show that I have something to say in perfumery, not just what you ask me for.\\" In the 21st century, perfumers are, happily, increasingly legitimate artists creating works independently (see under: Laudamiel, Kurkdjian, Maisondieu, Lie, Roucel, etc.) In the late 20th century, this was highly unusual.
