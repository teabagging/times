Some 20 miles of walking and biking paths line the city's seawall, much of it offering vistas of snow-capped mountains.      Then there's a walkable downtown centered on Robson Street's high-end shops and restaurants, a covered market entirely devoted to kids, hiking and skiing a hop from downtown -- you get the idea. Vancouver is also relatively clean, easy to navigate and, with new Asian money invigorating the mossy Englishy bedrock, a touch alien without being frighteningly strange.

Where can I go gold panning in the United States? -- Ellen Greenfeld, Roslyn Heights, L.I.     A.  The Gold Prospectors Association of America (Post Office Box 507, Bonsall, Calif. 92003","excerpt":"619-728-6620) is a good source for information on how and where to pan for gold. Members ($25 a year to join and $15 for subsequent years) get a bimonthly magazine on gold prospecting. The association also publishes an annual guide that lists areas where members have claims. In these places, other members can pan for gold without a permit and keep what they find. These areas include not only claims in the West, but also in national forests in the East (including the Carolinas and Vermont and New Hampshire) and the Midwest (Michigan prominently).  The guide, sold only to members, is $50, which includes accident insurance that protects panners and the holders of claims.    The association runs gold prospecting camps in Alaska, California and Oregon. Between early July and mid-August there are weeklong outings at a camp at the confluence of the Bering Sea and the Cripple River, 12 miles west of Nome, Alaska. For $1,850, participants get round-trip air fare from most United States cities, accommodations in cabins, meals, ground transportation and instruction. Additional weeks are $750. Participants equally divide the gold that is found, which rarely pays for the trip, an association official said. There are weekend outings, for $100, at association camps in Burnt River, Ore., just south of Baker, in the eastern part of the state, and a camp two and a half hours northeast of Los Angeles in the high desert.    There are several places that provide an opportunity to pan for gold for a few minutes or hours. In El Dorado County, Calif., where word of discovery of the precious metal started the Gold Rush of 1849, Gold Country Prospecting (3119 Turner Street, Placerville, Calif. 95667; 916-622-2484) offers three-hour outings on local rivers and creeks. Participants get pans and sluice boxes and instruction on using them. The cost is $40 for an adult and $20 for children aged 7 to 12; those younger than 7 take part free.    There are several old gold mining sites in Alaska that offer tours that includie a chance to pan for gold, generally from May through September. At Crow Creek Mine (907-278-8060), on New Seward Highway in Chugach National Forest, about 45 miles south of Anchorage, visitors are given a demonstration and a pan and shovel. The cost is $5; admission to the area without panning is $3.   The Old F. E. Company Gold Camp (907-389-2414), in Chatanika, 27 miles north of Fairbanks on Old Steese Highway, offers free gold panning.    At Gold Dredge No. 8 (907-457-6058), at 9 Mile Old Steese Highway, near Fairbanks, the admission price of $8 includes an opportunity to pan for gold. Children 8 and younger are admitted free.   Little El Dorado Gold Camp (907-479-7613), at 1.3 Mile Elliot Highway, near Fairbanks, charges $20 admission; $15 for children up to age 12. Included are a ride on a narrow-gauge train, a tour of old and new mining operations, and gold panning, with the guarantee of a gold nugget. Reservations are required.    Alaska Travel Adventures (907-789-0052), in downtown Juneau, offers a 90-minute tour in which participants view the old Alaska Juneau Mine and learn to pan in a creek two or three miles away. The cost is $24; $16 for those 12 and younger.    Alaskan Prospectors (504 College Road, Fairbanks; 907-452-7398), which sells gold panning supplies, is a good source of information on panning in Alaska.  Rainy Days in Hawaii    Q.     Is there a rainy season in Hawaii? I'm thinking of taking a cruise and have heard that it sometimes rains there for a sold week. -- Maria Wilhelm, Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.     A.  There is a rainy season in Hawaii, with November, December, January and March getting the heaviest rainfall. But the rain there mainly falls in the form of daytime shower that may last a half hour or so, often while the sun continues to shine.  Cruise lines report that they sail all year to Hawaii and that at sea it rarely rains for a whole day and practically never for a whole week.    Rainfall figures are gathered on land, rather than sea. Honolulu, on the southeast coast of Oahu and thus shielded from the trade winds, is relatively dry. It rains an average of 11 to 15 days a month there all year, with December and January the wettest months, each averaging a total of 4.1 inches, with March next wettest at 3.1 inches. The driest month there is June, with an average of .9 inches all month, but still with 14 rainy days. The northeastern sections, exposed to the trade winds, are wetter. Pepeekeo, on the northeastern part of Oahu, gets an average of 12.3 inches of rain in January and 14.4 inches in March, the wettest month, with 22 rainy days. In June, the driest month in Papeekeo, there are also 22 rainy days, though with 6.7 inches of rain.  Que Pasa in Puerto Rico?    Q.     We often travel to Puerto Rico and have been unable to get a copy of Que Pasa before we leave in order to find out what concerts, festivals and other events will be going on. How can I get a copy? -- Elsa O. Bley, Alstead, N.H.     A.  Que Pasa is a free publication and is intended to be picked up only in Puerto Rico at hotels, restaurants, tourist sites and so on. It comes out at the beginning of each month, but the Puerto Rico Tourism Company (575 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; 800-223-6530 or 212-599-6262) does not get copies until the second week of the month; the company will send a copy on request. So unless you are going to Puerto Rico at the end of the month, it may not be helpful. The tourist office does have available an annual calendar of events, though not as detailed as Que Pasa.  A Neapolitan Marble Veil    Q.     In which Neapolitan museum or church is that famous sculpture on which a veil covering the body is incredibly carved in marble? -- John Barbero, Port Chester, N.Y.     A.  The sculpture you seek is most likely the \\"Veiled Christ\\" completed in 1573 by Giuseppe Sammartino. The statue is in the Chapel of San Severo at 19 Via De Sanctis, which was reopened in June after two years' renovation. How the sculptor created the remarkable gossamer effect of the veil is a mystery. Some say he applied chemicals or a molten substance to the marble, while others say he used only his deep knowledge of the stone. The chapel (telephone 5518470), near Piazza San Domenico Maggiore, is open Monday, Tuesday and Thursday to Saturday from 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. and 5 to 7 P.M.; Sunday, 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. It is closed Wednesday. Admission is $2.60.

It is by no means limiting because the word encompasses history, philosophy, geography, art, armor, architecture, religion, theater and even the dreams and glories of civilization. These are among the visual and cerebral ''sights'' that travelers find last longest in memory. In this colorful series, one sees the paintings in museums head-on, without the crowds in front, and the landscapes and monuments, shining in splendor under perennial blue skies that are not always there for visitors and their cameras.   The guides start with the assumption that the traveler (or his agent) has figured out how to cross the Atlantic or the Mediterranean; which hotels are affordable; where to find something to eat and drink. Some of the conventional guidebooks are more ephemeral; hotels and restaurants change in class and price regularly. But apart from the inroads of pollution, the cultural monuments are unchanging.

An old diner there, the Blue & White (1355 Highway 61 north, Tunica","excerpt":"662-363-1371), serves sublime onion rings in a delicate but crunchy batter ($3.99 for a large order) and homemade pies. Allow a leisurely hour and a half for the 75-mile drive. When you find yourself swaying to the soulful sounds of WROX (1450 AM and 92.1 FM), you're getting close.    5 p.m.  2 -- Picking Cotton Not Required    The Hopson Plantation is where the mechanical cotton picker was unveiled in 1941, and it is again on the cutting edge -- this time with cultural tourism. The Shack Up Inn, above, consists of six former sharecropper shacks, each transformed into a guesthouse that sleeps three or four. Yes, there is indoor plumbing (and kitchenettes). The contrast of the shacks' down-at-the-heels histories and their contemporary coziness can, at first, feel presumptuous and like a form of exploitation. One guestbook comment read: ''Negrophilia: Commodification: Everything but the burden. Thanks!'' But the silence and the breeze sneaking through the shacks' open doors make them a profound way to experience the Delta. The Cotton Gin Inn recently opened on the same site: five hotel rooms built into an old cotton gin building.    7 p.m.  3 -- The Clarksdale Redemption    Just as you've become accustomed to the sense of being somewhere else, step into Madidi (164 Delta Avenue, 662-627-7724; www.madidires.com), a restaurant and cosmopolitan oasis, below. The Levingston salad ($6) -- baby arugula cloaked in cucumber and blue cheese -- refreshes, and the spicy catfish cake ($8) is a comfort. Striped bass is served with cardamom and coriander on grilled green tomatoes ($23). Madidi is partly owned by the actor Morgan Freeman, who lives in nearby Charleston. After dinner, stroll through the small downtown to Mr. Freeman's other venture: Ground Zero Blues Club (364 Delta Avenue, 662-621-9009; www.groundzerobluesclub.com). A former cotton warehouse, Ground Zero is Clarksdale's top blues spot. The local favorites in Clarksdale include Super Chikan, Jimbo Mathus (former leader of Squirrel Nut Zippers), the Deep Cuts and that cantankerous sweetheart, T-Model Ford.    Saturday    9 a.m.  4 -- Back-Door Museum    Breakfast at the Delta Amusement Blues Cafe (348 Delta Avenue, 662-627-1467) isn't anything you can't get on a grill elsewhere, but the sense of small-town intrigue is straight out of Eudora Welty. You can hear the laughing and cursing over poker and dominos even when the games aren't being played. Walk out the back door to the Delta Blues Museum (1 Blues Alley, 662-627-6820; www.deltabluesmuseum.org; $7 adults, $5 children ages 6 to 12). Alluringly low-tech, it delivers not only the music but also the culture that produced it. A former freight depot, the museum houses Muddy Waters's childhood cabin, above. Step inside and feel the blues falling down like rain. Nearby is Cat Head Delta Blues & Folk Art (252 Delta Avenue, 662-624-5992; www.cathead.biz), stuffed with Southern creations.    11 a.m.  5 -- My Meal Is Red Hot    Robert Johnson sang about them in ''They're Red Hot,'' and you can savor the heritage of hot tamales at Hicks Tamales & BBQ Shop (305 South State Street, 662-624-9887). Creamy cornmeal mashes with spicy beef centers, they're simmered for hours inside a cornhusk. Unwrap, eat, then whoop. For barbecue, locals favor Abe's (616 North State Street, 662-624-9947) and Big Jim's (1700 North State Street), a shack the size of a pickup where the delicacy is the Southern sweet pickle: cucumbers steeped in cherry, grape or strawberry Kool-Aid (50 cents).    Noon  6 -- Of Indians and Desire    Even for those who know Clarksdale well, Robert Birdsong's tour ($60 for three hours, custom tours available; 662-624-6051; birdsong@clarksdale.com) gives the place new life. Standing on the bank of the Sunflower River, where two Indian trading paths met, Mr. Birdsong lectures on an 1880 landslide that exposed a tribal burial site, attracting a Smithsonian excavation team. He then ties those events to the town's founder, John Clark, and his daughter Blanche Cutrer, whose homes are nearby. Ms. Cutrer, an eccentric party-giver, fascinated a young neighborhood boy named Tom Williams, who one day became Tennessee and the writer of ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' Blanche, of course, remained accustomed to the finer things.    3 p.m.  7 -- A Fine Mess    Hightail it 15 miles north to Friar's Point, a blocklong town that peaked in the early 1900's but has clung to life like morning dew on sweet potato vines. The North Delta Museum (700 Second Street, 662-383-2233; $4), at the base of the curving Mississippi River levee, comes across as the family attic given a rarefied name. Holdings include Civil War and World War I memorabilia and American Indian displays. Across the street is Hirsberg's, an old-time dry-goods store organized in a similarly cozy rat-packing manner.    6 p.m.  8 -- Faulkner, Twitty, Crayfish    In the middle of somebody's nowhere, you are near an unusual fine-dining experience for anybody. In 1926, an Elk's Lodge was built on Moon Lake in Dundee, attracting local gamblers. The place was frequented by William Faulkner and owned by Tennessee Williams's family and later by relatives of Conway Twitty. Since the mid-70's, it has been Uncle Henry's Place (5860 Moon Lake Road, 662-337-2757; www.unclehenrysplace.com), run by George Wright, its chef, and his mother, Sarah, the resident historian. The food reflects their Louisiana roots, but their talk is local. The crayfish étouffée ($20.95) is rich, and the crabmeat au gratin ($21.95) is plentiful and delicate.    9 p.m.  9 -- Rust Never Sleeps    It's a 25-minute drive back to Clarksdale, and time to check in at Red's (395 Sunflower Avenue) for some deep local flavor. The outside is strewn with rusted grills. And inside, the live music will push you toward abandon.    Sunday    9:30 a.m.  10 -- Sunday, Coming Down    Another comment from the Shack Up Inn guest book: ''Great fried shrimp at Ramon's. T-Model Ford at Red's, Wiley and the Checkmates at Ground Zero. Try fried grits with honey. Learn to take it slower.'' Sound advice and, faced with Clarksdale's blue laws, you don't have much choice. Try breakfast at the Shady Nook (16774 Highway 61 north, 662-621-1525), a truck-stop cafeteria on the north side of town. And be sure to chat with other guests passing through the shacks' lobby, which is the owner Bill Talbot's living room.    11 a.m.  11 -- Take Me to the River    The Quapaw Canoe Company (291 Sunflower Avenue, 662-627-4070; www.island63.com), named for a regional Indian tribe, does for the Mississippi River what Mr. Birdsong does for the city. Trips can vary from an outing of a couple hours to several weeks. John Ruskey, one of Quapaw's guides, lives in a house once owned by the Wingfields, where the missus was known for her menagerie of glass animals; it's also the Catalpa House bed-and-breakfast (110 Catalpa Street, 662-627-5621; $50 a night).    THE BASICS    Blues Town, U.S.A.       Rent a car at the Memphis airport, tune the radio and drive south on Highway 61 to Clarksdale.     The Shack Up Inn and the Cotton Gin Inn, above, are considered the places to stay in Clarksdale and cost $65 a night. Both are at 001 Commissary Circle, 662-624-8329; www.shackupinn.com.     Upstairs from the Ground Zero Blues Club are the Delta Cotton Company Apartments, available nightly or longer term (on Blues Alley, 662-645-9366; $75 to $105 a night; www.groundzerobluesclub.com).      The Riverside Hotel was the hospital for blacks where the blues singer Bessie Smith died in 1937 after a car accident (615 Sunflower Avenue, 662-624-9163; rooms from $40).      Clarksdale is devilishly hot in summer, and the Comfort Inn's small pool is very refreshing (818 South State Street, 662-627-5122; www.comfortinn.com). Rooms start at $65 a night.     The Big Pink Guest House (312 John Lee Hooker Lane, 662-645-1815; www.bigpinkguesthouse.com) is an old icehouse and, in the 1950's, it was a swinging soda fountain. In the heart of downtown, it's rooms are $100 to $125. 36 Hours in Clarksdale, Miss."},{"year":"1932","title":"Destroyed by fire on maiden trip","excerpt":"663 passengers rescued FRENCH LINER BURNS' 237 ABOARD MISSING; Ships Take 663 Off Georges Philippar, Abandoned at the Mouth of Gulf of Aden.

IDENTITY: Retired chairman of Bloomingdale's","excerpt":"68-year-old president of Marvin Traub Associates, a consulting and retailing company.    NEW BOOK: \\"Like No Other Store . . . The Bloomingdale's Legend and the Evolution in American Marketing,\\" (Times Books, $25). The final chapters are devoted to Bloomingdale's period of bankruptcy after Robert Campeau took over its parent, Federated Department Stores, in 1988.    CURRENT CLIENTS: Ralph Lauren, American Express and Saks Fifth Avenue. Marvin Traub Associates also owns Conran's Habitat, the chain of home furnishing stores.    Q.  Do you still shop at Bloomingdale's?    A.  I was there about 10 days ago. I was in the men's store and I ordered some shirts.    Q.  But you don't have to be loyal anymore, do you?   A.  I also shop at Saks as well as Paul Stuart. When I was at Bloomingdale's, 90 percent of my purchases were there, as were Mrs. Traub's. I had a rule: she could shop anyplace she wanted as long as she bought at Bloomingdale's.   Q.  What have you been up to since leaving in 1991?    A.  I've worked with QVC. I originally took Diane Von Furstenburg to QVC, as I say in the book, and through Diane, Barry Diller became very much involved. I've brought a number of different projects to them, including Barbara Taylor Bradford. When it was a great success, the folks at QVC said, \\"Marvin, when your book comes out, we'll work together with you on it.\\"   Q.  So you're planning to go on the air to sell it?   A.  Yes. It will probably happen sometime in early December.    Q.  Hasn't QVC had too much hype though?   A.  It's interesting to think that the total volume of QVC, Home Shopping Network and all the infomercials that are made is a little more than 15 percent of J. C. Penney's sales. It is a very tiny business, but it will grow. It will not replace people going into department stores or shopping centers.   Q.  What else are you doing?   A.  We started a business with Elizabeth Taylor for costume jewelry, which Avon is making. It's being launched this month. We have another company we started up with Iman, the model. We are doing a line of cosmetics and skin care for women of color.    Q.  What do you think of the direction of Bloomingdale's since you left?   A.  I think I have made it plain in the book that I have a concern that Bloomingdale's maintain a level of uniqueness that excited people to shop there. I know there's an enormous profit pressure that makes it hard to do either a country promotion or some major new idea.    Q.  What do you mean \\"concern\\"?    A.  The emphasis is on other things. I'm being very measured because I really don't want to seem like sour grapes.    Q.  You do say in the book that you didn't like Michael Gould, your successor as chairman.    A.  Mike was not my first choice for the job, but Mike does have the job, so I'd like him to be successful. For the sake of all the people there and everything we've built.    Q.  You don't mince words about Robert Campeau either. You even imply that he cheats at golf.    A.  He was just driven to win at most any cost. He had some sound ideas and some excesses.    Q.  Having once tried to lead a management buyout of Bloomingdale's, are you disappointedthat you don't own the store?   A.  No. I loved running Bloomingdale's, but with this new second career I am as busy as I've ever been.
