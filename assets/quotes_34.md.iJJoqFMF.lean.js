it appears likely that both houses will approve Soc Security increases to reflect rise in living costs before adjorning next mo; it is not known whether Pres Nixon will sign bill; Soc Security recipients, under HR bill, will receive 7% increase beginning with Apr '74 checks and 4% increase starting with July's checks; to help pay for increased benefits, amt of a person's annual income subject to Soc Security tax will be raised to $13,200 starting Jan '74 from $12,600 wage base that had been scheduled to take effect in Jan; maximum wage base in '73 was $10,800; additional increase in wage base means that maximum Soc Security tax in '74 would rise to $772.20, compared with $631.80 in '73, but increase would be paid by those making more than $10,800 a yr; Soc Security increase would replace 5.9% cost-of-living increase approved last spring by Cong that had been scheduled to take effect in June '74; minimum Soc Security payments, under new benefit schedule, would be increased from present $84.50 a mo to $90.50 in Apr and $93.80 in July; avg payment for single person would rise from present $167 a mo to $178 in Apr and $186 in July, while avg benefit for couple would increase from present $277 to $296 in Apr and $310 in July; main difference between HR bill and measure approved by Sen Finance Com is that Sen version would make 1st increase of 7% effective immediately on enactment instead of with Apr's checks;

The Statesmen got the ball back and a surge of relief swept over the players and their coach, B.J. O'Hara. This Hobart lacrosse team was not going to be the school's first to lose the national championship.    That had been the threat in recent seasons, as each year the streak became more burdensome. In 1989, when Coach Dave Urick went off to Georgetown, he was sorry to leave the lovely lakeside campus in Geneva, N.Y., but not sorry to be rid of the pressure to extend the string of titles.   Last Saturday, the Hobart team held on during those last seconds and won the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III championship game, 12-11, over previously unbeaten Salisbury State at Salisbury, Md. The victory marked the 12th consecutive year the Statesmen had won the title -- every year since the tournament began in 1980. And that extended an N.C.A.A. record in any team sport.   This season was a difficult one. \\"This team wrote a different chapter,\\" O'Hara said. \\"It was heartwarming, every bit as sweet as any other. And I've been around Hobart lacrosse, as a player and coach, for 20 years.\\"   The Statesmen went into the eight-team tournament seeded fourth, having lost 6 of their 11 games, albeit 5 to Division I foes and 3 of those by one or two goals.    \\"We had an awfully young team,\\" the coach said. \\"A lot of freshmen. And early on we lost for the season our goalie, our best defenseman and our best face-off man with injuries.\\"    Another N.C.A.A. title seemed distant after Syracuse blitzed the Statesmen, 22-8, on April 13. But there was improvement and O'Hara felt better when the playoffs began.    After Hobart swept past Clarkson, 19-11, and Nazareth, 19-17, to reach the final, O'Hara told his athletes to forget about the streak. \\"Let's just appreciate that we're here,\\" he said. \\"And what it took to get here. We've got one more game to play, and anything can happen.\\"   Tim deLoe had three goals","excerpt":"Bill Miller, the star, had two, and Jim Gracey was terrific in goal with 20 saves.   Next year? \\"Hey,\\" said the coach. \\"We get a few days off to smell the roses.\\"   Fast Turf a Test for Tar Heels     Syracuse will be playing on home turf -- very fast home turf -- during the Division I Final Four, which begins Saturday inside the Carrier Dome.   The Orangemen's semifinal opponent will be North Carolina, undefeated at 14-0 after defeating Loyola of Baltimore in the quarterfinals, and seeded No. 1, but also a team that plays its home games outdoors on a slower grass field. The Tar Heels' coach, Dave Klarmann, and the players acknowledge that the Orangemen will have a distinct home-field advantage. But they cannot worry about that because nothing can be done.   If history is important, Syracuse has won 30 of its last 31 games played in the dome and 66 of the 70 it has played there since its opening in 1981.    The Orangemen's last loss in the dome was on March 23, by 18-12 to Johns Hopkins, the team Syracuse then beat, 11-8, in Baltimore on Sunday in a quarterfinal match.   The other semifinal Saturday matches neighbors, No. 7-seeded Maryland, which upset Brown in the quarterfinals, and No. 11-seeded Towson State, which prevailed in triple overtime aganst Princeton. They met in the regular season on March 13, and the Terrapins won, 17-16.   The final will be played Monday.
