It was a gloriously warm autumn Sunday and the Pontiff was about to begin another of what has for so many years been a triumphal procession to the canopied outdoor altar set on a wooden platform overlooking St. Peter's Square. Two priests and three pious virgins would be beatified this October morning, and a cheering, adoring crowd (60,000 people, perhaps) was on hand.

He had it over Leon Spinks in weight, reach and &#8212","excerpt":"without question &#8212; talent. But a 36-year-old boxer is an old man, and the hubris of Ali, thinking he could fight a determined 24year&#8208;old as though he were the same age, cost him his heavyweight title in a split decision last week. Ali remained the consummate showman almost to the end: He &#8220;danced&#8221; in nearly every round, and in the early going he made faces for the crowd. In the late going, the changes in his face were involuntary. There may be more fights ahead for him, but perhaps never as champion. Thus ends an era of a man who was much more than the dominant prizefighter of the postwar period. He was a symbol of black assertiveness since the 1960's. As such he rankled much of ,white America, and not just because he was loud.. In 1964, as Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., a Christian, he wrested the title from Sonny Liston. Instead of humility, he offered defiance, the news that he had become a Muslim who called himself Ali. It was too much, especially for many&#8217; sportswriters, some of whom still cannot write his name without putting an &#8220;a.k.a.&#8221; after it. He became &#8216;a symbol to underdeveloped nations around the world with his protest against the Vietnam war in 1967, when h&#8217; refused to be inducted into the Army. It was no idle gesture. Outraged boxing authorities stripped him of his title even before the courts got around to convicting him of draft evasion. It was not until 1971 that the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction, and not until 1974 that Ali recovered the heavyweight crown. Throughout, he never doubted his own worth or hesitated over hyperbolic expressions of his self&#8208;esteem. &#8220;I'm fighting for people all over the world,&#8221; he once said. &#8220;If I win, people all over the world's going to win. If I lose they're all going to lose.&#8221; Ali was chastened, even gracious, in defeat last week. But he will soon weary of diffidence. There is not only the lure of becoming the first heavyweight to win the title&#8226;three times, butthe millions to.be added to the $60 million he has earned in almost two deca6s of fighting. He could use the inciney. For all that he has made, he has retained relatively little because of enormous expenses.'A rematch is likely: Leon Spinks, a real&#8208;life &#8220;Rocky,&#8221; is willing, but he also knows what he is up against. When Ali entered the ring in Las Vegas, Spinks joined in the applause. He recognized a role model; after the fight, he was quick to supply Ali&#8208;esque doggerel. &#8220;He's still The Great est,' the new champiqn said. 'But I'm the latest.'

Employers who too-prudently fund their pension plans will get a similar message if some self-proclaimed champions of employees and retirees, and their supporters in Congress, get their way. These groups are advocating the reversal of a nearly half-century-old policy that permits an employer to reclaim excess pension assets that are not needed to pay benefits promised in the company's pension plan.\\n\\nA combination of generous funding practices and a booming stock market in recent years has swelled some pension funds beyond what is needed to pay retirees their promised benefits. Some companies, as permitted by law, have terminated their plans, purchased annuities to pay benefits to current and future retirees and have kept the surplus. This practice, known as pension reversion, has been falsely labeled a theft of employees' money.

These reports should dispel any \\"notions that the U.S. economy can rebound sharply anytime soon,\\" Merrill Lynch said, and should make it more likely that the Federal Reserve will further relax monetary policy.

[ D16. ] Competitors Seeking Unity On Format for Videodisks  The two rival camps developing competing videodisk systems -- one led by Sony and Philips Electronics and the other led by Toshiba and Time Warner -- are negotiating on a unified format to prevent a costly war over standards.

It was the second time this month that raids had turned up evidence that organized-crime rings were bringing in foreign workers illegally -- and Presidential politics quickly reared its relentless head.

He walks to a Coke machine -- past a screen displaying, naturally, Windows 95 -- but has no money. And so on, in a new TV commercial. Windows promotion continues.  [ D4. ] Technology Stocks Fall  Technology stocks fell -- even Microsoft, on glorious Windows 95 Day, lost $1.75 -- pushing the Nasdaq down 7.26 points. The Dow industrials edged down 4.23 to 4,580.62.

More typically, poets work on their poems alongside an array of literary and quasi-literary projects, from novels (Hardy) to plays (Yeats) to libretti (Dryden) to art reviews (John Ashbery) to advertising slogans for Lay's Potato Chips (James Dickey). Marianne Moore even once spent a month helping Ford come up with names for the car that was eventually christened the Edsel. (Moore's suggestions included ''The Intelligent Whale,'' so you can't say the company didn't get its money's worth.) Yet while poets have excelled at a number of sidelines, they've done some of their sharpest work in a genre that's often overlooked: the personal letter. Not all great poets are great letter writers, of course, but the correspondence of Pope, Keats, Rilke and many others is more than simply an interesting supplement to the poetic canon","excerpt":"without these letters, poetry as we know it wouldn't exist.     In part, this is because poets often have used letters to arrive at new ways of thinking about poems. For example, in a letter to Louis Untermeyer, Frost defined literature as ''words that have become deeds,'' an idea that has direct application to his verse; similarly, Rimbaud famously described poetic development to Paul Demeny as ''a long, gigantic and rational derangement of all the senses.'' But letter writing relates to poetry in deeper and more peculiar ways as well. A letter presupposes a writer and a recipient -- an I and a You -- and poetry, in its original, lyric form makes a very similar assumption (Sappho: ''So once again come, Mistress; and releasing / Me from my sadness, give me what I sue for''). As W. R. Johnson points out in his acute study ''The Idea of Lyric,'' this assumption is missing from much 20th-century poetry, but the old I-You structure has never vanished entirely. Indeed, poets are haunted by the concept of speaker and audience the way novelists are haunted by the idea of time.

Detective Thomas Wray said Daniel Rakowitz, 30 years old, who is charged with murdering Monika Beerle, 26, led officers to the skull after they arrested him at the El Caribe Club, where he was dishwasher.   The police have said that Mr. Rakowitz and Ms. Beerle, a dancer from Switzerland who was also a student at the Martha Graham school, argued after she asked him to move out of their East Village apartment.   Mr. Rakowitz, a former mental patient, told detectives he killed Ms. Beerle during a fight when she came at him with a lead pipe. The next day, he bought a saw and garbage bags and cut up her body in a bathtub, the detective testified.   The bucket in the bus terminal was filled with chlorophyll-scented cat litter. \\"I could see the top of a human skull and a knife handle,\\" said Detective Wray, the 18th witness at Mr. Rakowitz's murder trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.   On Wednesday, Milton Irrizary, a 42-year-old homeless man, testified that Mr. Rakowitz served a friend of his soup containing a human finger.   Mr. Irrizary said Mr. Rakowitz brought a large bucket of soup into Tompkins Square Park days after the killing.

Last week, Paramount showed 20 minutes of one of its end-of-the-year great hopes, Bill Condon's ''Dreamgirls,'' and on Sunday it unveiled 20 minutes of Oliver Stone's ''World Trade Center,'' about two Port Authority police trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center. (The film is to open in August.) The excerpt was shown before a screening of Mr. Stone's ''Platoon,'' his 1986 drama about the Vietnam War, showing here in the Cannes Classics section. After taking the stage with the three stars of ''Platoon'' -- Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen -- Mr. Stone spoke very briefly, in French, about what he called his ''work in progress.''     He noted that the special effects looked like something out of a Japanese science fiction film (they didn't) and that ''the truth must exist in some way to confront power and extremism.'' These words were followed by 20 unnerving minutes in which we follow a Port Authority officer, played by Nicolas Cage, from his predawn rise to when the second tower collapses on him. It would be both impossible and unfair to say more, other than that the footage looked good and was very upsetting to watch, primarily because it includes images of the actual burning towers.

The play - a naturalistic visit with 29 low-life denizens of an all-night Upper Broadway coffee shop - caused a sensation at the Cafe La Mama in 1965","excerpt":"witnesses say that the doors had to be locked to keep out excess theatergoers. Mr. Wilson soon went on to co-found the Circle Repertory Company and to produce a body of work that only one other American playwright - a fellow Off Off Broadway renegade, Sam Shepard - has matched over the last 20 years.    Until one witnesses the stunning revival of ''Balm in Gilead'' at the Circle Rep, it's hard to imagine how the excitement of two decades ago could be rekindled today. Later (and better) Wilson plays, from ''The Hot l Baltimore'' to ''Fifth of July,'' have made the writer virtually an establishment figure. ''Balm in Gilead'' - improvisational in style, awash in the rock-and-drug culture - is a patchy artifact of the 60's. Yet the electricity that must have swept through La Mama - that of discovering original theatrical talent - still courses through the new ''Balm in Gilead'' almost from start to finish.

Moreover, the English subtitles do not help lift many veils.Mr. Konwicki, for the record, is a 40-year-old author, screen writer and director who was responsible for \\"The Last Day of Summer,\\" (1958) shown here at the Museum of Modern Art six years ago, and \\"Halloween,\\" which hasn't been screened here. In \\"Salto\\" he has combined elements of Kafka and Biblical allusions to compound the strange adventure of a seemingly schizophrenic stranger who drops from a moving train and, panic-stricken, makes his presence felt on the inhabitants of the weird villagers of this unnamed hamlet.The stranger says he knows the town and its people and he maintains that he uses several names because he is being pursued and wants to avoid his pursuers. He confuses a fortune teller by besting her at her game. He heals a couple of sick boys. He has an ineffectual, amorous interlude with the daughter of his host, a good, gentle man who cynically feels that being good is foolish. As a self-declared prophet (the stranger derides the town's somewhat raving poet, an elder, a military man and a young drunkard seeking \\"sublime\\" love.Eventually, in Kafkaesque style, he leads these odd denizens in a dream-like dance called the \\"Salto\\" as the culmination of a strange annual town celebration. A would-be actor declaims and others indicate that everyone else is being psychologically exposed by the stranger. And, finally, a woman, accompanied by two children, arrives in town and states that the stranger is her husband, who is a charlatan and woman-chaser.
