But they expect to live somewhere. \\"When people refused the offer to come to Cooper Union, the reason most often cited was the lack of available housing,\\" said John Clarke, the acting chairman of the school's building committee.   As a result, the 131-year-old school is developing its own housing: a 15-story structure for 193 students in apartment-like suites accommodating three to five people. The building is to rise at an obliquely angled site on Stuyvesant Street, across Third Avenue from the Cooper Union Engineering Building, at Ninth Street, and one block north of the Foundation Building, as the school's original landmark structure is known.   Construction is to be financed with tax-free bonds issued by the New York State Dormitory Authority. Mr. Clarke said the school was now awaiting contractors' bids and anticipated that construction would begin in February, with the building open in time for the 1992-93 school year. The building is to be clad in what he described as a brownstone-colored brick, with sash windows, an undisguised water tank and a recessed light fixture running the height of its south wall, which is on a lot line. The architect is Rolf Ohlhausen of Prentice & Chan, Ohlhausen, a Manhattan firm selected by the trustees from among three competitors.   Cooper Union has slightly more than 1,000 students enrolled in its School of Art, in the Albert Nerken School of Engineering and in the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture. Tuition is free, supported by an endowment established by the industrialist Peter Cooper. A student apartment, however, will probably cost $2,300 a semester.   \\"This housing is primarily directed at students entering Cooper Union as freshmen,\\" Mr. Clarke said. \\"If you're 18 years old, it's a pretty daunting idea to move into the Lower East Side and live on your own. But our experience is that once students get there, and get to know the Lower East Side and get to know other students, they'll go off to find their own accommodations.

Masa has arguably dislodged it as New York's most expensive restaurant, and Per Se may well have usurped it in terms of an average meal's running time. But for a particular and traditional type of decadence, Alain Ducasse at the Essex House is still the place to go.    CAFÉ GRAY  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 823-6338; Time Warner Center (third floor) at Columbus Circle; $$$; Review: 12/15/04.  Gray Kunz's new restaurant has a glinting, sparkly, vast dining room that faces an open kitchen. The best of the food here is fabulous, and the menu as a whole is a pleasure-packed testament to Mr. Kunz's nimbleness of imagination and execution.

In every aspect, from the austere design of the dining room to the pacing of the meal to the quiet professionalism of the staff, the focus at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's restaurant is on the food.    MASA  **** [Rating: Four Stars]  (212) 823-9800; Time Warner Center (fourth floor), Columbus Circle; $$$$; Review: 12/29/04.  Masa, despite its chosen peculiarities and pitiless expense, belongs in the thinly populated pantheon of New York's most stellar restaurants. Simply put, Masa engineers discrete moments of pure elation that few restaurants can match. If you appreciate sushi, Masa will take you to the frontier of how expansively good a single (and singular) bite of it can make you feel.    PER SE  **** [Rating: Four Stars]  (212) 823-9335; Time Warner Center, Columbus Circle; $$$$; Review: 9/8/04.  The chef, Thomas Keller, lavishes attention on every aspect of a meal. If you can wangle a reservation at one of its 16 tables that puts you in Per Se around dusk and allows you to watch the light fade over Manhattan, do it. The reward is a profound sense of peace that few of this frenetic city's restaurants can offer.

Nelson, a Manhattan developer, bought an abandoned lumberyard at the foot of Main Street in Cold Spring, N.Y., 50 miles from midtown Manhattan, in 1986, he envisioned a commercial project there. His idea was to capitalize on the village's growing appeal to weekend visitors seeking antiques shops, galleries and restaurants.   But the shops and offices were never built and Mr. Nelson, who heads Nelson Equities, now expects to start construction next spring on a 16-unit condominium project instead.    \\"The original concept for a commercial project was consistent with the village's master plan,\\" Mr. Nelson said. \\"But after further discussion, the planning board and I concluded that traffic and parking were potential problems. I also felt that since Main Street was a weekend, strolling kind of place, the shops might be too dependent on seasonal business.\\"   All units in the Waterfront, as the complex will be called, will be two-bedroom duplex apartments ranging in size from 1,200 to 1,600 square feet.    The project's architect, Heather Faulding, who heads her own firm in Manhattan, has designed the white clapboard-styled buildings so that entrances to the apartments and garages will be at street level and all the living spaces will be on the second and third floors and have views of the Hudson River.    \\"The design makes the most of the river,\\" Ms. Faulding said, \\"and it offers some privacy to residents who will be living on Main Street.\\"   The developer expects buyers to be both people looking for full-time housing and those in the market for weekend retreats. Prices have not been set, but Mr. Nelson expects them to start at about $225,000.
