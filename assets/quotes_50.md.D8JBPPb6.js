On PBS it's practically a premiere week, not that the network would be so crass as to call it that. There are new seasons of ''FRONTLINE'' (Tuesday","excerpt":"check local listings for all PBS programs), which kicks off in a timely manner with ''Return of the Taliban,'' and ''AMERICAN EXPERIENCE'' (Monday), which takes another route: the first PBS broadcast since 1993 of the much-honored civil rights documentary ''Eyes on the Prize.'' Also new is an episode of the recurring science magazine ''NOVA SCIENCENOW'' (Tuesday) that includes a look at whether the asteroid Apophis will hit Earth, and Bill Moyers's latest news program, ''MOYERS ON AMERICA'' (Wednesday), which begins with a reconstruction of the Abramoff scandal.    On completely different, but no less serious, notes: ''SOUTH PARK'' (Comedy Central, 10 p.m. Wednesday), the one place where they really know what satire means, returns for its 10th season. ''THE STREET'' (BBC America, 10 p.m. Tuesday), a six-part drama set on a street in a northern English town, has impressive credentials: the cast includes Jim Broadbent, Jane Horrocks and Timothy Spall, and the lead writer is Jimmy McGovern, who created the series ''Cracker'' and wrote the fine feature film ''Liam.'' And finally -- O.K., this is less serious -- the season premiere of that show all those people you don't know are watching, ''BATTLESTAR GALACTICA'' (Sci Fi, 9 p.m. Friday). What's a Cylon, you ask?

Little or no attempt is made to avoid stop-the-presses clichés, and Michael Cooke, The News's editor in chief when the series was made, gives in to temptation completely when describing the competition with The Post: ''We put our foot on their throat every day and press down till their eyes bulge and leak blood, but still they won't die. We just have to keep at it till they do die.''    His boss Mortimer B. Zuckerman, owner of The Daily News, probably won't be as happy with the later, more honest moment when Mr. Cooke says, ''You're up against a guy, you know, the best tabloid newspaper guy in the world, you're up against Rupert Murdoch.''    To heighten the ''His Girl Friday'' dramatics, episodes are built around the rush to meet the nightly 10:30 deadline, which will strike a lot of journalists as quaint in the constant-deadline world of the Internet. For viewers who have not spent time in newsrooms, what may stick in the mind are scenes of young reporters mocking their subjects: amusing when it involves celebrities at a benefit, discomforting when it involves witnesses to a shooting in Harlem. The series's truest reflection of the current realities of the newspaper business may be that two of the principal characters in its early episodes, Mr. Cooke and the gossip columnist Hud Morgan, no longer work at The News. (For a look at a more genteel journalistic realm PBS is offering an ''AMERICAN MASTERS'' profile of Walter Cronkite on Wednesday","excerpt":"check local listings.)

It's a cut above most American-made cartoons, if only for the quality of the voice talent: PAUL GIAMATTI as Screw-On Head and DAVID HYDE PIERCE, giving new meaning to the term archfiend, as Emperor Zombie.

Ms. Meeropol returns with ''THE HILL,'' a six-part documentary series beginning Wednesday at 9 p.m. on the Sundance Channel. It follows the young staff of Representative Robert Wexler, a Democrat from Florida, as it tries to steer him through the shoals of Social Security, Iraq, Valerie Plame and various hurricanes in 2004 and 2005. The focus is on policy, not debauchery. In the four hours I watched, there were no interns gone wild, though the question of why a liberal Democratic press secretary and legislative assistant keep getting involved with Republican men did arise. Another cliché avoided is that of the whip-smart young staff baby-sitting the air-brushed, empty-headed politician. Though it's hard to know in how many ways viewers are being spun by a documentary shot amid this crowd, the picture we appear to be seeing is of a smart, impulsive, relatively sincere legislator who's barely in control of the earnest, backbiting, self-important and frequently dunderheaded young people who try to push him toward their positions on issues.    Midway through ''LOMAX THE SONGHUNTER,'' the Dutch filmmaker Rogier Kappers's documentary about the musicologist Alan Lomax (PBS, Tuesday","excerpt":"check local listings), a young Lomax stands outside a room full of earnest young folkies and says, ''Well, you're in Greenwich Village now, where people come to get away from America.'' The film proceeds to get away from America entirely, tracking down people in villages in the Hebrides and Spain who had performed for Lomax's tape recorder decades before. On the program they light up at the sound of their own voices, and then sing the songs again, as proud as ever.

But all the energy, comedy and piercing sadness that make Beckett great are on display in ''Beckett on Film,'' a project that brings his 19 stage plays to the screen, translated into works of pure cinema by an amazing lineup of directors and actors.    Tonight PBS presents a 90-minute special, ''Stage on Screen: Beckett on Film'' (10 p.m., Channel 13","excerpt":"check local listings), which includes seven of the plays, including one of the project's most stunning. Jeremy Irons plays two roles, the identical Reader and Listener, in ''Ohio Impromptu,'' a hauntingly beautiful, elegiac 10-minute play more moving than its throwaway title suggests. (It was written for a 1981 symposium honoring Beckett at Ohio State University.) With flowing white hair and a black coat, Mr. Irons faces himself at a long table. The Reader begins reading from a book, a tale of the Listener's lost and perhaps dead love. At times the silent Listener raps on the table, as if he can bear no more, and the Reader pauses, only to pick up the tale again. Mr. Irons, his face hollow, creates a timeless portrait of loss. As the Reader, the ghost of a memory, he does justice to Beckett's graceful words: ''Stay, where we were so long alone together. My shade will comfort you.'' The Listener responds with expressions of excruciating sorrow.

And although charter operators insist that the vast majority of their vacationers return home satisfied, there have been horrifying accounts of delayed departures, prolonged confusion at airports, dismaying switches in accommodations and indifferent or nonexistent assistance at times of stress.   Before you book a charter, therefore, it is important to discuss carefully with your travel agent not only what the brochure promises but also what could go wrong and who will bear what sort of responsibility if it does.   This year, however, the charter field has narrowed mostly to seasoned operators with several years of experience and accumulated clout with airlines, hotels and other suppliers of facilities and services. Thus, the risks appear to have diminished. Also, since it has become so expensive to take a scheduled flight to many warmweather destinations, your only hope of affording a vacation in such a place may be to go by charter.

And, sadly enough, neither is this melodrama, which came to the Palace on Saturday. For the business of cleaning up the welter of red herrings left along the trail of the person who killed the philandering Hollywood song writer, generally is as intriguing as the arrest of a peeping Tom. And, though Detective Raft does get into a couple of bloody battles, the moments of excitement and suspense in this hour-and-a-half manhunt are rare.Joan Harrison, who began her trade with the master, Alfred Hitchcock, has produced the picture with an eye toward the terse, hard-bitten school of murder mystery. She and Edwin L. Marin, whose direction is not altogether unique, and Jonathan Latimer, Frank Fenton and Rowland Brown, the writers, succeed only fitfully. Their plot has Raft (a stubborn cop who can't envision the deed as a suicide) seek a femme fatale. And since the murdered man's distaff friends are legion, he spends most of his time listening to their varied but palpably uninspired alibis. And even though Detective Lieutenant Raft does finally tie up the loose ends, a strand or two is left dangling at the climax.The brash Mr. Raft, who loses his badge but eventually regains it, is called on to be grim in this adventure and unswervingly fulfills his assignment. Lynn Bari is the most charming and pleasant of his suspects, while Virginia Huston and Myrna Dell are among the other ladies, whose escutcheons are not quite clean. Edward Ashley, the victim, appears briefly, and Joseph Pevney, a newcomer, plays a jazz pianist smoothly and with restraint. It's obvious, however, that Mr. Raft was being extravagant when he remarks during the film that being a detective is \\"a good life, with low pay and plenty of excitement.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Cherchez La Femme"},{"year":"1948","title":"Campbell, A: Tales My Father Told TALES MY FATHER TOLD.

The entire community of the New York University Medical Center deeply mourns the passing of our reknowned colleague, Dr. Rudolf Baer, an outstanding member of the faculty of the NYU School of Medicine for 55 years. He was the epitomy of a gentleman and a scholar. A most beloved Chairman of the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology for over 20 years. During his tenure as Chairman, the Department developed to be the leading academic and clinical dermatology service in the US. Through his productivity, he set the direction of modern research in dermatology. As a physician/ scientist, he influenced the training of an entire generation of young dermatologists in cell biology, biochemistry and immunology. A whole new era of clinical investigation was developed by his efforts. He received numerous awards, honors and citations and was elected to the highest offices by his colleagues nationally and internationally. Every major dermatological society benefitted from his wisdom and clinical acumen. Dr. Baer was respected and admired by his peers throughout the world. A gentle and wise man who became a role model as a physician, spouse, father, grandfather and brother. A mentor to all who knew him. He was a constant presence at NYU until the last days of his life. He and his beloved late spouse, Louise, were loved and highly respected by all of us at NYU and in many places around the world. It was tragic to learn of the passing of his devoted son, Andrew during the same week of his own death. He will indeed be forever remembered by his colleagues and peers everywhere.

He was an integral part of the Medical Center since 1964, and established and led the psychiatric inpatient unit for 30 years. Born in New York, he completed his medical training in Vienna and his psychiatric training at Bellevue Medical Center. He completed analytic training at New York Medical College. Dr. Fier was loved and respected by all his colleagues. He was a true physician, understanding his patients as people and caring for them in a compassionate and professional manner. He taught us that psychiatry was an integral part of all medical practice, and emphasized the importance of considering the mind and body as a whole. He was Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at UMDNJ-Newark, and his devotion to medical education inspired generations of medical students and residents from the medical school, who looked to him as a role model. Dr. Fier imparted humility and wisdom to his students. He loved music, art, and literature. Most of all he loved his family. He is survived by his mother, Freda; his wife, Ricki; his three children, Ian, Carl and Claudia; his daughters-inlaw, Rachel and Layne; and his grandchildren, Hannah, Samantha and Daniel. He will be remembered and mourned by his family, colleagues and friends. Dept. of Psychiatry, H.U.M.C.    FIER-Morton. A most dear, loved friend. Goodbye does not seem possible.
