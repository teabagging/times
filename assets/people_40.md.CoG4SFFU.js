A hasty and deplorably incomplete inventory would show two blood sacrifices, two ordinary murders, incantations in three languages, a lunatic witch doctor, a white woman with a bad case of heebie-jeebies and a patriotic effort on the part of 2,000 crazed natives to exterminate all the white folk on the island, not counting the white goddess. It sounds like a good reason for pulling down the shades and hiding under the bed. That is about right. \\"Black Moon,\\" although it is strictly studio-made, is admirably equipped to throw a double-bar-relled scare into the innocent entertainment-hunter.Of course, there is always Jack Holt to fall back on in the pinches. Mr. Holt is a great comfort at all times, but when it looks as if nobody is going to get out of the theatre alive, he is positively indispensable. In \\"Black Moon\\" he is married, somewhat incautiously, to Juanita Lane, who thinks voodoo is a fine pastime because you meet such interesting people. It seems that, during her childhood on the West Indian island of St. Christopher, her Negro nurse inducted her into the mysteries of blood sacrifice. Years after her marriage she develops what the psychiatrist in New York vaguely calls a neurosis. Returning to St. Christopher with her child, she promptly permits herself to be installed as high priestess of the voodoo cult. By the time Mr. Lane‚Äîthat would be Mr. Holt‚Äîturns up, the other whites are going quietly mad with fear. Before you can say St. Christopher, the natives have murdered the wireless operator, stolen the schooner and besieged the plantation house, and the whites are a poor 1-to-1,000 shot to last out the night.There are times when the reassuring Hollywood touch appears in the picture. For example, the native ritual which precedes the main or throat-cutting event has a precision in the dance routines and mass singing that suggests the Busby Berkeley touch. But it is difficult to think of details like that when Mrs. Lane picks up the knife to slaughter her own child.The performances, in addition to Mr. Holt's, are good, with Arnold Korff as the grim white master of the island, Dorothy Burgess as the priestess, Cora Sue Collins as the little girl and Fay Wray as the not too meddlesome love-interest.

Indeed these dangers inhere in any trade agreement negotiated under \\"fast-track\\" approval authority, which permits Congress to reject but not to amend the final agreement.   Both agreements have the potential to pre-empt United States environmental, consumer and safety laws. They would classify many United States safety standards that exceed those of importing countries as trade barriers and pre-empt them.   For example, in last year's Uruguay round of GATT, the Bush Administration readily accepted replacement of our domestic food safety standards with weaker standards set by an obscure group of international scientists called the Codex Alimentarius Commission.
