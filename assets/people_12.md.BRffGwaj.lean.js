Under Bill Clinton, Arkansas has the second lowest tax burden per person in the country. Those are the facts. Back to the show.\\" ACCURACY    The bare facts are accurate, but the Bush organization quickly issued a rebuttal suggesting distortion. The Republicans argued, among other points, that \\"the 1990 budget agreement was forced on the President by a Democratic Congress obsessed with spending.\\" The Bush forces also contended that Arkansas's tax revenue is low only because Arkansas's citizens have been kept so poor under Bill Clinton.\\" SCORECARD    The ad appears to break into regular programming for a news development rather than a political commercial. It hits a nerve in the Bush campaign: Coming during the week of the national convention, it is a reminder of the no new taxes pledge President Bush made at the convention four years ago. Patrick J. Buchanan used the \\"no new taxes\\" theme in his Republican primary challenge to Mr.Bush. TELEVISION SCRIPT 2    \\"More facts. Under George Bush, America has had no growth in private-sector jobs and wages have fallen. This year, under Bill Clinton, Arkansas leads the nation in job growth. And incomes have grown at twice the national rate. Those are the facts. Back to the show.\\" ACCURACY    The thurst of the commercial is true: fewer new jobs have been created in the Bush Administration than in any other Presidential term since World War II. But the Bush campaign points out that the ad neglects to acknowledge that some jobs have been created. The Republicans also say that using wage figures is misleading because wages are only one measure of compensation. SCORECARD    The ad is effective in that it appears to authoritative, not purely a political commercial. And it hits President Bush on an issue that is a cornerstone of his campaign, the importance of creating jobs.

Officials said it would be used for about a week in 20 markets, but they would not say where.   ON THE SCREEN -- Opens with \\"1988\\" on a white background. Images of President Bush at assorted public appearances four years ago, including the 1988 Republican convention.   THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Ad Campaign","excerpt":"Clinton: Attacking Bush's Record"},{"year":"1992","title":"The only picture of Mr. Clinton is a small photo of him grinning at the end of the ad.   TELEVISION SCRIPT -- Narrator: \\"1988.\\"   Bush: \\"30 million jobs in the next eight years.\\"   Narrator: \\"1990. America's jobless rate hits a three-year high.\\"   Bush: \\"I'm not prepared to say we are in recession.   Narrator: \\"March 1992. Jobless rate hits six-year high.\\"   Bush: \\"The economy is strengthening.\\"   Narrator: \\"George Bush vetoes unemployment compensation.\\"   Bush: \\"The economy continues to grow.\\"   Narrator: \\"July 1992. Unemployment is the highest in eight years.   \\"If George Bush doesn't understand the problem, How can he solve it? We can't afford four more years.\\"   ACCURACY -- The statements are accurate, but the ad juxtaposes images of Mr. Bush with events that are not directly related in time to what he is saying. For example, Mr. Bush is shown on Nov. 8, 1991, saying the nation is not in a recession, and the next image is words saying the jobless rate hit a six-year high in March 1992. The Bush campaign accuses the Clinton organization of exploiting the hardship of Americans in the ad.   SCORECARD -- In its first negative commercial, the Clinton campaign seeks to avoid being accused of gutter tactics by letting the President hang himself with his own words. The topic is the one that polls show is foremost on the minds of voters: the economy. The Clinton forces are trying to steer the debate in that direction. On the Economy   ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Clinton at a desk in shirt sleeves, tie loose, American flag and old-fashioned radio behind him. Throughout the commercial, the camera cuts from Mr. Clinton talking about his economic prescriptions to words bolstering his remarks: \\"Income is down,\\" \\"Higher unemployment,\\" and \\"What it takes: New Jobs . . . Cut health care costs . . .\\"   TELEVISION SCRIPT -- Mr. Clinton: \\"We've been under trickle down economics for 12 years -- just keep taxes low on the wealthy and see what happens. Well, I'll tell you what happens. Most Americans are working harder for less money, unemployment's up, health care costs are exploding, we are not doing what it takes to compete and win.   \\"I've worked hard on a different plan. Let's give incentives to invest in new jobs. Let's spend more on education and training. Let's provide basic health care to all Americans. Putting our people first. Rebuilding this economy. Making us competitive. If we do those things, we'll compete and win. And we'll bring this country back.\\"   ACCURACY -- There are no factual inaccuracies, although Mr. Clinton's assertion that \\"we'll compete and win\\" is, of course, speculative. Republicans argue that the tax burden of Mr. Clinton's programs would ultimately fall on everyone, not just the wealthy, who the Governor says are not paying their fair share.   SCORECARD -- The two new Clinton ads complement each other, one criticizing Mr. Bush, the other portraying Mr. Clinton as the more capable. In once again inviting viewers to call an (800) number to obtain a copy of its proposals, the Clinton organization seeks to give the impression it has a meaty, workable plan. THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Ad Campaign","excerpt":"Clinton: Criticizing the President"},{"year":"1992","title":"TELEVISION SCRIPT -- Announcer: \\"Something's happening. People are ready. Because they've had enough -- enough of seeing their incomes fall behind and their jobs on the line. Enough of a Government that just doesn't work. They're ready for change. And changing people's lives, that's the work of his life. Twelve years battling the odds in one of our nation's poorest states. Arkansas now leads the nation in job growth. Incomes are rising at twice the national rate.   \\"Seventeen thousand people moved from welfare to work. That's progress, and that's what we need now. Change. Real solutions.

Those making over 200,000 a year have to pay more. The rest of us get a break. But don't take their word. Read it yourself. It's a plan to put people first again. And six Nobel Prize economists say it'll work. For people. For a change. Bill Clinton for President.\\"    ON THE SCREEN -- Colorful images from the campaign's bus tours, many in slow motion. The images are patriotic: small children, people along roadsides with American flags, Mr. Clinton reaching into crowds to shake hands. Mr. Clinton is also seen working at his Governor's desk and delivering his speech at the Democratic National Convention. (Sixty seconds).   ACCURACY -- The Clinton campaign issued a flurry of documentation for the claims in this ad, including statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Commerce and the Arkansas Department of Human Services to support figures on job and income growth and the contention that eight million jobs will be created in four years.   The claim that Mr. Clinton's tax increases will affect only those earning $200,000 or more is undercut by the campaign's own previous assertions that some people making more than $150,000 will see their taxes rise.   Officials of the Bush campaign said the ad emphasizes only the good news about Arkansas's record and Mr. Clinton's economic plan. Other rankings have shown that Arkansas comes in near the bottom in income per person and in environmental protection. In addition, Bush officials argue that Mr. Clinton's economic plan would cause job loss through military cuts.   SCORECARD -- The commercial will run in several states this week, but the Clinton organization will not say which ones. Like the 15-second commercials that were broadcast during the Republican convention, this ad seems intended to challenge the Republicans to respond. By continuing to focus on the economy, the Democrats are sticking to their determination to focus the debate on what they believe is the President's weak spot.

Many have forgotten -- or never knew -- that the system of \\"draft deferments\\" was consciously designed to encourage young men into careers and occupational tracks, and not coincidentally to defuse antimilitary sentiment by making the articulate middle class safe from the draft. The publication in 1967 of the famous \\"Channeling\\" memo by Gen. Lew Hershey, the Selective Service director, made college students aware of their intimate involvement in the prosecution of the war through complicity in the draft deferment system.
