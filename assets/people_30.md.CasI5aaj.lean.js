The first of these was presented last August and the second, last October. Both are still running. Now comes a third series of Vitaphone features, linked with John Barrymore in his latest screen adventure, \\"When a Man Loves.\\" This program is to be heard and seen at the Selwyn Theatre, and judging by the attendance last Tuesday afternoon it will be some time before there are vacant seats in that house.Whatever shortcomings there are in the Vitaphone reproductions, there is no denying the fact that each successive presentation gains in points over its predecessor. The results are pleasing and occasionally inspiring. Sometimes, it is quite true, the voice does not always appear to come from the singer's mouth and there are periodical weaknesses in delivery, which now and then possesses the tonal quality of the reproducing horns. The words are, however, clear, although the softer tones of the female singers are not as true in their upper registers. Even this is not always the case, for Mary Lewis's songs are delightful. One of them was \\"Way Down South\\" and another, \\"Carry Me Back to Old Virginie.\\" Miss Lewis adds no little charm through her winsome smile to her vocal renditions.More Popular Numbers.Charles Hackett of the Chicago Opera Company is another asset to this new Vitaphone concert. His rendition of \\"La Donna e Mobile,\\" from \\"Rigoletto,\\" rivals Martinelli's excellent Vitaphone number at Warners'. Then there is the quartet from \\"Rigoletto,\\" with Marion Talley, Jeanne Gordon, Beniamino Gigli and Giuseppe de Luca, which is not only effectively sung but admirably presented.There are a few popular numbers, which, although they are aptly registered, rather jarr on one after listening to the classical airs. One of these is \\"She Knows Her Onions,\\" which Mr. Warner says was put on the bill to please those not so partial to operatic music. Mr. Warner is one of those showmen who is endeavoring to please all of the people all of the time.Mr. Barrymore's New Film.\\"When a Man Loves\\" is the movie title of an adaptation of Abbe Prévost's story, \\"Manon Lescaut.\\" It is extravagant at times and the captions are in some cases verbose, but, nevertheless, it is always entertaining, and the principals deliver competent performances. For Mr. Barrymore this is a suitable vehicle, and he is ably supported by the attractive Dolores Costello and that clever character actor, Warner Oland. Sam De Grasse makes the most of the rôle of Count Guillot de Morfontaine, and Stuart Holmes, a veteran villain of the screen, rises to the regal task of impersonating none other than Louis XV.There are some delightful settings in this production, and the costumes, when the occasion demands, are gorgeous.During many of the chapters there is a nice strain of humor. For instance, in the sequence in which Fabien des Grieux indulges in a party of cards with Louis XV, there are a number of clever touches and Mr. Barrymore adroitly seizes the opportunity to contribute his share to lighten these scenes, as he does when he first sets eyes upon Manon Lescaut (Miss Costello). It is rather joyous to see Des Grieux leaping into the little vehicle, after having cut loose all the other horses to stop chances of pursuit. The conveyance was intended for the gay Count Morfontaine, who was to accompany Manon to Paris.As Des Grieux, Mr. Barrymore has opportunities to register a sterner note. After having been perceived in a gallant episode, wherein his trusty blade flashes against a dozen others, Des Grieux exhorts the prisoners in the \\"hell hold\\" of a convict vessel to mutiny. Huge men tear at their shackles until they are freed, and then it is a matter of only minutes before they fight their way out of the top of the barred space. In the course of this chapter, in which Des Grieux urges the blacks and whites with startling epithets and queer phrases, he looks almost demoniacal, something like Dr. Jekyll's other self.The ending to this production is decidedly of the film world, for the hero and heroine are beheld in a boat with an absurdly small sail making their way toward the American coast.Miss Costello is personable as Manon, but she is perhaps a little too much given to showing her ability to weep. Mr. Oland reveals himself to be a natural actor. He has, it is true, figured in many similar rôles, but whether he is drinking, nodding in a carriage, or stalking through a ballroom, he is at his ease. Even the way he holds a long cane makes an impression, for he does so as if he were accustomed to such an appurtenance. He is also quite at home in the laces and silks of those old days in France.Mr. Barrymore is wideawake to his task, and, although it is only a picture to which he is lending his talent, he goes about his work with a full appreciation for the pathos, gallantry and wild conduct, according to the demands of the various sequences.The Irish and the Scot.THERE is a lot of hefty humor in \\"McFadden's Flats,\\" which, despite its blacksmithean touch, aroused many a peal of laughter in the Mark Strand. This picture, like those rough and tumble farces, \\"We're in the Navy Now,\\" \\"The Cohens and the Kellys\\" and \\"Behind the Front,\\" has gained such favor that it has been held over for a second week. It hasn't much of a plot and nothing overwhelmingly novel in ideas. It lives up to its title, and whether the Honorary President of the Hod Carriers' Union is getting a lane cut through his thick hair or is endeavoring to avoid talking a bath, the wit is just about as keen.Charles Murray and Chester Conklin supply most of the rumbling fun. Mr. Murray belongs to a school of comedy that advocates slipping frequently over rugs and pretending to be in a doze in bed with a cigar between the fingers of the left hand. Mr. Conklin's method is more natural, as he relies chiefly on his expressions, eyeglasses and a mustache to arouse mirth. He is far more subtle than Mr. Murray, who has been given many ancient comic notions to express in this feature.\\"McFadden's Flats\\" is a battle between the Irish and the Scots, and in the end they both seem to be heroes and therefore both are triumphant. Mr. McFadden is a contractor, and it is Jock McTavish's savings that are invested in the Irishman's construction work. Jock is a thrifty soul. He turns out an electric light the second he does not need it and when he sells hair restorer to a customer he merely pretends to use some of the liquid. McFadden, on the other hand, is the sort of person who believes in the adage, \\"Nothing venture, nothing gain.\\" He stakes his all on an extravagant party in order to attract the attention of a Man Higher Up, with whom he seeks a partnership. He is never worried, one reason being that Jock's money is paying for the wine and feast, which fact, when it becomes known to the Scot, is distinctly disconcerting. One of the best touches in this film is where McFadden and the Man Higher Up seize upon new books that have never been read to demonstrate an effective bricklaying idea.There is a young girl in this film and also Sandy, Jock's son. They supply what there is of romance. But that matters even less than McFadden's beaux gestes.\\"It\\" and Its.ELINOR GLYN'S name and the title, \\"It,\\" are in themselves a valuable start to a production. Added to these virtues, in this particular photoplay of the brief appellation, there is the attractive Clara Bow, who is not unknown for her charm. Any story would thus serve for a film with these attributes, and the producers do not seem to have gone far out of their way to get a vehicle, for they have that dear old theme, the shop-girl's romance with her employer. \\"It\\" is referred to more than once and the title writer introduces two minor characters as \\"just a couple of itless its.\\"Miss Bow is seen as Betty Lou, who, one learns, is \\"topheavy with It.\\" She is picked out as a girl with the necessary quota of charm by Monty, a guileless individual, who is part and parcel of the narrative because he supplies the comedy. Cyrus Waltham, the young department store owner, also qualifies as having \\"It,\\" after Betty Lou meets him. But whether he has \\"It\\" or not, he is not expected to succumb to \\"It\\" by any such demonstration as kissing Betty Lou—that is, not in the beginning of this yarn.The last seen of the two with \\"It\\" is on a ship's anchor. Both have been in the water and they are enjoying an embrace, for by this time Betty Lou does not resent a kiss. You have a vague idea from the outset that this would happen. In fact, although this subject is not annoying, it could never be assured of possessing a fraction of suspense or one iota of subtlety.Mr. Keaton's Face Overpowers This Film.FIRST Raymond Griffith turned his hand to producing a comedy of the Civil War. Now Buster Keaton, the stoic comedian, also has made one. He centres his activities on a locomotive that is very dear to his heart and known as the General. Mr. Keaton portrays Johnny Gray, who would probably be one of the last men on earth to be selected to run the locomotive of the Twentieth Century Limited, even after his experiences in this somewhat mirthless piece of work.A good deal of money has been squandered on this picture, which is called \\"The General,\\" and some of the scenes are quite effective. There are hosts of uniformed extras and hundreds of horses, not to say anything of three old-time locomotives. However, it is difficult to reconcile one's self to a hero who is apparently astute in some things and almost idiotic in others. This man, who has difficulty in crossing a road, is supposed to be crafty enough to outwit the Northern General.The chapters in which Gray runs his locomotive through the Northern lines are sometimes mildly humorous. Where there is water it is used with a certain effect, and when the fuel runs short in the fire-box of the locomotive Gray does his little best. He is accompanied by Annabelle Lee, who thinks that Johnnie Gray is a brick. She has her own mental deficiencies, it seems, for she throws pieces of wood about as big as a lead pencil into the engine fire and then tries to make up for her stupidity by struggling with big logs.

Cuomo of New York (\\"Two Missing Landslides,\\" editorial, Nov. 8) ignores or minimizes key elements of this year's election. Mr. Cuomo is the first Democrat ever elected to a third four-year term as governor. He broke Thomas E. Dewey's record of 53.1 percent for a governor seeking a third term and won by more than 1.2 million votes, the highest margin for any candidate winning a third term as governor. He is also the only governor to have won by more than one million votes, and he has accomplished that twice.   The Governor accomplished this despite a dismal 34 percent turnout in New York City, the bastion of liberal Democratic and Liberal voters. The low turnout was the result of voter perception that there was no true contest, given the antics of the Republican candidate.   Debating substantive issues with, as you put it, \\"the embarrassingly unprepared\\" Republican candidate, with an inflexible Conservative ideologue and with the one-issue Right to Life candidate was a near impossibility as witnessed on Gabe Pressman's television program Sunday, Nov. 4.    Yet Mr. Cuomo on his own repeatedly voiced the concerns of mainstream New Yorkers and offered pragmatic solutions, while maintaining his vision of a just and civilized society. RAYMOND B.

This disease eating up her empathy and decency is what she picked up from the effortlessly cool Evie (Nikki Reed), who crashes into Tracy's life and plucks her from an existence of age-appropriate fixations like Barbie dolls. Evie, with the physical confidence of a much older girl, knows exactly how to devastate Tracy; she breezily drops hints that she thinks her new friend is immature. As Evie takes Tracy under her broken wing to remake her, we feel we're watching the protagonist of &quot;Thirteen&quot; undergo the initiations of a new tribe.  The closest  the film comes to a narrative is in following its young central figure straying into sex, drugs and alienation and her sudden detachment from her struggling single mother, Melanie (Holly  Hunter). What we recognize from the stricken look in Melanie's face is the same panic in Tracy's eyes — it's something mother and daughter share, and Ms. Hunter wills this spiritual match-up into existence. The movie has the ebb and flow that comes from material structured as a series of anecdotes —  it doesn't build, and sometimes it feels as cluttered as a 13-year-old's bedroom. But that may be a byproduct of Catherine Hardwicke's attempt to layer incidents that are as far as possible from the weary set of clichés that inform pictures about teens. Ms. Hardwicke, making her directorial debut, works from a screenplay she authored with Ms. Reed, shaped around autobiographical elements from the actress's own life. Usually, the protagonist is the bystander — in &quot;Thirteen,&quot; she's the fuse. — Elvis Mitchell Trading Barbie for Drugs, Sex and Halter Tops"},{"year":"1925","title":"Austin, F B, Thirteen A BELATED DISCOVERY","excerpt":"THIRTEEN.

The producers of this handsome production, the Fox Film Corporation, have taken the work very seriously, even to enlisting the services of Joseph Urban to design the settings, and yesterday afternoon there was no doubt that the audience took this screen offering seriously. Many a dainty handkerchief was dabbed on a pretty face during some of the episodes in the career of the unfortunate Lady Isabella","excerpt":"this alone was a testimonial to Miss Harding's impressive performance.All the players contribute good performances. Clive Brook appears as the reckless and reprehensible Sir Francis Levison. Carlyle, whose first name is changed from Archibald to Robert, is impersonated by Conrad Nagel. The bigoted and none too truthful Cornelia Carlyle is played by Cecilia Loftus. Joyce, the faithful maid, is played by Beryl Mercer and the impecunious and well-meaning Lord Mount Severn is portrayed by O. P. Heggie.Frank Lloyd's direction of this costly production is vastly superior to anything he has done in several years. Bradley King and Tom Barry are responsible for the script, in which liberties are taken with the old tale, even to having Lady Isabella in Paris during the Franco-Prussian War, and Levison meets his death in the French capital when a building is struck by a missile from a Prussian gun.But whether the scenes are in England, France or Austria, they are put forth with a compelling effect. The lighting in the interior scenes of East Lynne, the Carlyle homestead, is most artistic and the arrangement of the windows, the stairway and the furnishings keeps one's eyes roving to all parts of the screen. But when Miss Harding appears, always attractively gowned, she captures one's full attention.In an initial flash, Carlyle and Lady Isabella are on their knees, their marriage ceremony being almost over. Carlyle is in love with his beautiful wife and she is in love with him. It is not long before the disagreeable Cornelia reveals her disposition and she soon essays to plant harmful ideas in her brother's head.East Lynne is a charming structure with fine old trees and undulating lawns, but Cornelia and, afterward, to a certain extent, Carlyle, frown upon any gayety, whether it be Isabella playing bear with her youngster, or a little fun at a dance. Dignity is what the Carlyles desire in their home and a sense of humor is a characteristic possessed only by hoi polloi or men without shirts.The play does not seem so very old as it is done here. It arouses one's interest when Levison appears at East Lynne, for he had admitted his deep affection for Isabella soon after she was married. They are to go to a dance, but a case in Chancery prevents Carlyle from being present. It is therefore arranged that the glum, fault-finding Cornelia shall chaperon Levison and Lady Isabella to the ball. At the eleventh hour Cornelia grumbles about a headache. She is so sorry and all that sort of thing, for she knows how disappointed Isabella is. Lady Isabella Carlyle, having had more than enough of the objectionable Cornelia, decides, come what may, to forego the luxury of a chaperon and accompany Levison to the dance. Innocent though Lady Isabella is of the charge, it is difficult for her to convince others that, while Sir Francis entered her room, he only told her of his love and left soon afterward.Following that crisis, Isabella, now a divorcée ostracized by the upper ten, goes abroad, and on the Channel boat she encounters Levison. It looks as though Lady Isabella is going to have a relatively happy time, but Levison, who has a roving commission in the British diplomatic service, is called before his Ambassador in Vienna and is forced to resign his post. It appears that he has accepted money from the French for certain information. Then both Isabella and Levison go from bad to worse, until he is killed and she is told that the injuries she suffers at the same time will result in her losing her sight.The actual ending of the film is a trifle too melodramatic, but what happens just before is accomplished is an appealing fashion.Mr. Brook acts with his usual restraint. Miss Loftus is capital as the sinister Cornelia. Mr. Nagel does well as Carlyle, and Miss Mercer and O. P. Heggie serve their rôles commendably.

An intricate, elegant novel that ponders the connections among love, illusion and fidelity in the permutations of eight central characters behaving in two romantic and romanticized cities, New Orleans and Venice.    LONG FOR THIS WORLD, by Michael Byers. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) The protagonist of Byers's first novel is a medical geneticist whose special anguish is his inability to help the victims of a rare genetic disease that kills them of old age by 19 at most; his love for a particular patient calls him to risk his career.    THE GIRL FROM THE FICTION DEPARTMENT: A Portrait of Sonia Orwell, by Hilary Spurling. (Counterpoint, $24.) A biographer illuminates the brilliant, beautiful, industrious woman who knew everybody in literary London; the model for Julia in ''1984,'' she was Orwell's wife for the last 14 weeks of his life and his executor ever after.    STAR OF THE SEA, by Joseph O'Connor. (Harcourt, $25.) A ripping yarn, by an Irish critic and playwright, that is also an agonizing inquiry into our vast tolerance for the suffering of others, in this instance the perishing Irish of 1847, morally observed by an American journalist and the captain of a ship carrying &#233;migr&#233;s in steerage.    THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME, by Mark Haddon. (Doubleday, $22.95.) Presented as a detective story, this funny, original first novel stars a sort of autistic savant, 15 years old, whose grasp of social clues is near zero (he cannot lie or understand a joke) but whose logical faculties are dominant except when overloaded.    GILGAMESH, by Joan London. (Grove, $23.) A first novel with epic affinities whose heroine, a dweller in the Australian outback, experiences something like conversion when she meets a handsome Armenian lad whom she pursues, with their child, all the way to Yerevan -- a sort of descent into hell -- hoping for rediscovery and renewal.    THE BUG, by Ellen Ullman. (Nan A. Talese/ Doubleday, $23.95.) A thrilling, intellectually fearless first novel that reinvents the story of Frankenstein's monster as an allegory of the birth of the computer among engineers in Silicon Valley; a Yale Ph.D., hired to test computer codes for bugs, falls in love with the ''artificial reality'' inside the machine.    ISAAC NEWTON, by James Gleick. (Pantheon, $22.95.) Color, detail and narrative flow are all nicely handled in this biography of the discoverer of the optics of color, the laws of motion, universal gravitation and the calculus -- a man whose life has resisted scrutiny because he was reclusive by nature and avoided criticism by going incommunicado.

While the Dodgers and the Raiders moved despite loyal fan support, the Giants speak of leaving San Francisco to find an audience. What McGee called a lack of political will on the part of Mayor Feinstein is more accurately a failure of the population to display enthusiasm that community leaders can support. It's clear that few San Franciscans think the Giants are worth a fight, increased downtown traffic, or public investment. Last year ''The City by the Bay'' was shook up about choosing an official song. In the face of such controversies, the Giants must remain a lower priority.   Last year, the Giants drew barely one million fans, the second worst attendance in the National League. Candlestick's Arctic conditions, featuring afternoon onshore winds followed by bone-chilling fog, certainly contribute to the small gate. The Giants' promotion and marketing people are among baseball's most creative. Last year's feature was The Crab, a mascot that fans hated.

The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn deeply the passing of Douglas Dillon, whose benevolence and stewardship profoundly shaped the course of this institution over the past 50 years. He was a visionary and enactor of surpassing greatness, whose interests and sphere of influence enriched all aspects of the Museum. With virtuosity and unflinchingly high standards he fulfilled many roles-collector, donor, benefactor, trustee, acquisitions committee chairman, and-most significantly - Museum Pres ident (1970-78) and Chairman of the Board of Trustees (1977-83). Under his leadership, the Metropolitan Museum doubled in size adding major new galleries that include The American Wing, The Temple of Dendur in The Sackler Wing, the Robert Lehman Wing, and The Michael C. Rockefeller Wing. By galvanizing the acquisitions program he underscored the Museum's mission to present the greatest works of art from all cultures and historical periods, and his tireless efforts in this area brought countless masterpieces among them Velazquez's ''Juan de Pareja'' and Monet's ''Garden at Sainte - Ad resse''-into the Metropolitan's collections for all to enjoy. Perhaps Douglas Dillon's most lasting mark on the institution is the enrichment of its collection of Chinese painting which with his support and encouragement grew from modest holdings into a collection of world preeminence","excerpt":"this collection is now housed in galleries that bear his name. His personal generosity did not stop there-he also supported exhibitions, publications, curatorial and educational activities, and building programs. There is no area of the Museum that has not profited from his advice, encouragement or benefactions. With dedication and passion, he persued an obsessive desire for his favorite art institution to become the greatest art institution in the world.

It was a novelty in \\"Variety,\\" it is still interesting in \\"You Never Know Women,\\" but the third time will probably wring shouts of protest from those who like their pictures straight. And yet it will probably be done. It generally is.There is little doubt that the popular German production was the inspiration of this picture, and, unlike most pictures which seek a market to which some one else has pointed the way, it is rather well done. At least, it is almost exciting: to see the difference in the way Hollywood and Germany work out a given situation. \\"Variety\\" was a ghastly tragedy","excerpt":"this contorts itself in trying to provide thrills and a happy ending at the same time. Perhaps it isn't art, but it is a satisfying enough result. The triumphant love at the end isn't overcompelling, but it is a gentle and proper emotion.Feeling, probably, that a lack of intensity later on may be replaced by a fillip at the beginning, the picture no sooner starts than Vera, played by Florence Vidor, is almost ruined by a steel girder which falls to the street at a point from which she had been rudely shoved a second before by a worker on the building. He holds her fainting figure until that villainous Lowell Sherman, who plays Mr. Foster, comes along in his car and relieves the workman of his embarrassing burden. Mr. Foster does those things very gracefully. So gracefully that he works himself into Vera's life by all the devious ways known to a man about town.She is the star of a troupe of Russian acrobats, clowns and magicians, and when Foster follows her to the theatre he sees, as does the villain in \\"Variety,\\" the show in which she has a leading part. The picture exhibits the same unusual and clever camera work from above and below the point of action, so that the audience has its part in the story. The thrills are provided by a knife-throwing scene in which Vera is surrounded by shivering blades, and it is done so realistically that the eye follows the knife from the hand of the thrower until it hits the board. That really is a good trick. These same knives offer Ivan, who is in love with Vera, an opportunity to pin Foster to the board later in the picture, when he is discovered making villainous love to Vera. He is entirely hemmed in with knives, but it is done in such a gentlemanly way that one doesn't feel there is very much venom behind the heaves, and when Foster yanks a pinned coat-sleeve loose and walks off the honors are all with him. Sherman is always such a polished and likable villain, anyway.When Ivan tries to make Vera think he has died by failing to work out of his Houdini-like manacles, after he has been thrown into the East River in a locked box, she realizes all too late that it is he she loves and not the sleek Mr. Foster. But Ivan only fools her, and comes up beside a rowboat hidden under the dock. After he rids her of Foster she makes his gentle soul happy by drumming into his brain that she loves him after all. And there is the happy ending.It is a well staged and directed picture, and the acting in it is adequate for the tepid emotions called for by the story. Nobody ever gets very much worked up, not even Ivan when he sees Vera being taken from him. The scenes on the stage of the theatre during the performance are excellent, and so is that in the theatrical hotel where the troupe lives. But somehow one feels that instead of working itself out naturally and realistically it is being very carefully controlled and kept within the bounds of convention. Incidentally, the title is woefully misleading.

This is from \\"Honey From A Weed: Fasting and Feasting in Tuscany, Catalonia, the Cyclades, and Apulia\\" (North Point, paper).      Whether the feast lasts for seven years or whether it lasts for a week or a night, and whether we have forgotten the abundance and nature of the fare and the colour of the wine, and whether the faces of the company are as clear as they then were, or are blurred, we still feel we have taken part in an unique event. In fact a feast beginning with an ample supply of drinks and victuals generously offered, is always destined for an unknown goal, one which is inspired and revealed by the imaginative gifts of the participants.   And if one has no such gifts? In good company there is a place for you: a disposition for amusement, a healthy appetite, an attentive ear, a capacity for laughter, each is fuel for celebration's fire. William Wordsworth, Spy?      Wordsworth's penchant for rambling about the English countryside in search of inspiration once got him in trouble with the authorities -- who suspected the poet and his sister of being French spies! This is from \\"William Wordsworth: A Life\\" by Stephen Gill (Oxford University, paper).     On 8 and 11 August 1797 Dr. Daniel Lysons of Bath alerted the Home Office to the suspicious behaviour of the tenants at Alfoxden. Repeating what his cook had told him of gossip she had heard from one Charles Mogg, a former servant at Alfoxden, Lysons identified the Wordsworths as \\"an emigrant family\\" who had \\"contrived\\" to get hold of the house. Their relationship to one another was dubious -- \\"the master of the House has no wife with him, but only a woman who passes for his Sister\\" -- and their behaviour even more so. They go, said Lysons, on nocturnal or diurnal expeditions, taking notes on their observations of the terrain. \\"They have been heard to say they should be rewarded for them & were very attentive to the River near them.\\" The Last, Best Hope      No President has written with more passion, clarity, or moral force than Abraham Lincoln. This is from the annual message to congress for 1862, included in \\"Abraham Lincoln on Democracy,\\" edited by Mario M. Cuomo and Harold Holzer (Cornelia & Michael Bessie/HarperCollins).      Fellow-citizens,    we    cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We    say    we are for the Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We -- even    we here    -- hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In    giving    freedom to the    slave   , we    assure    freedom to the    free    -- honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best, hope of earth. Other means may succeed","excerpt":"this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just -- a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless. The Poet at the Ball Park      In a memoir of Marianne Moore, George Plimpton recorded the delightfully unconventional observations of the poet (and baseball fan) during a World Series game. The piece is included in \\"The Best of Plimpton\\" (Morgan Entrekin/Atlantic Monthly).      Junior Gilliam was the batter at the time, standing back from the plate and leaning easily on the bat as the action developed at second base. \\"He is simulating sangfroid,\\" Miss Moore said of him, surely the first time that phrase has been used in Yankee Stadium. . . . Johnny Podres of the Dodgers came out to pitch his half of the inning. He got the first two batters, Kubek and Richardson, and seemed to be working effortlessly. Miss Moore, looking at him carefully, said, \\"Podres affects a great insouciance, but I really doubt he has it.\\" . . . She had some things to say about the pigeons, the height of the pitcher's mound, a fine Zen Koan observation on Mantle being run out in the third inning (\\"The distance between home plate and first base is too great\\"), the double play (\\"It is a cruel thing but necessary\\"), on the practice of trading players (\\"It is scandalous and I don't approve of it. If a player is good enough for one team he's good enough for another\\"). Ample, Redeeming Darkness      Each age reads its own preoccupations into the classics. Robert Lowell describes how modern writers rooted through world literature to find ancestors for their own somber views. This is from the essay \\"Art and Evil,\\" included in Lowell's \\"Collected Prose,\\" edited by Robert Giroux (Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paper).      Old classics no longer pleased; but presently we discovered with relief that supposedly sound authors were much worse than they seemed. We discovered the black nihilistic, homosexual, almost disintegrating Shakespeare of    Measure for Measure, Troilus, Hamlet,    and    Timon   . We discovered a black gin-drinking Tennyson. We discovered a black wolfish, wife-deserting Dickens, whose grotesque Hieronymus Bosch world struck us as God's plenty, a richer dramatic creation than any English writer's since Shakespeare. Then a funny thing happened: just as we had . . . managed to point out an ample and redeeming shadow of darkness in just about every writer who had ever lived -- just at this point we suddenly found we were midway in a second solid, sensible, wealthy, optimistic, child-bearing era, one not unlike the times of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

Before putting the mower away, mow the lawn short, one-inch or so","excerpt":"this discourages development of spring lawn fungus diseases and promotes quick comeback of grass when the growing season resumes next year.   Overgrown Yew     Q.    We have two overgrown yews that should be three to four feet high; now they are eight feet high. Is it possible to cut these plants off at a height of one to two feet from the ground and coax them back to their proper size? Or should we uproot them and start with smaller plants? J.A.B., Pittsford, N.Y.     A. If this question was asked in spring or midsummer, cutting back would be no problem, but pruning is chancy at this time of year. Conifers are going into winter and this question comes from a snowbelt region where winters can be severe. Drastic pruning this late in the season could be detrimental to yews. This question points up the need for keeping plants under control by annual pruning. Scaled-down yews are available if a new landscape were going to be started in spring. The recommendation is to wait until spring and then prune the yews hard to reshape them and keep after them once their size has been reduced. The yews will grow back quickly and new growth will cover any unsightly pruning cuts. Grapefruit Seedling     Q.     Our 20-year-old grapefruit tree, grown from seed, seems to be getting sparser. It is wintered indoors in front of a patio window and summered outdoors. How much longer will it survive? Should I feed it? A.M.D., Canandaigua, N.Y.     A.  If the grapefruit has survived in a pot for 20 years, well done. In the citrus groves, grapefruits are large trees. They live for several decades. But when roots are confined in a pot, 20 years is excellent survival time for this large tree. Why not start another grapefruit \\"tree\\" from seed or an orange or a lemon seed. Or select another type of tropical \\"tree\\" such as a Ficus to take its place. Pot Storage     Q.    We have a large terrace and want to save several large pots, made in Italy, for use next year. What do you recommend? Mrs. T.P., Chicago, Ill.     A.  If they are terra cotta (clay) pots, they should be moved into a sheltered location, that is a garage or cellar for storage. The soil can be left in the pots and used again next year, if it is mixed with some fresh potting mixture and perhaps a handful of a slow-release fertilizer. Do not leave any terra cotta or clay pots outdoors. The freezing/thawing will either crack or exfoliate the terra cotta pots. By contrast plastic tubs and wooden tubs survive weather extremes and can be left outdoors all winter with the soil left in them. Odd Shrub Bloom     Q.     Last spring our forsythias and azaleas had flowers only on what I called their skirts -- the lower branches. Why? And what can we do to prevent this from happening next spring? Mrs. S.S., Putnam Valley, N.Y.     A.  Nothing, just be hopeful for deep snow, nature's blanket. The plants mentioned bloomed on their \\"skirts\\" or lower branches because these branches were protected, maybe with snow or other plants nearby. The open winter last season did not produce much snow and flower buds on many plants were blasted by the extreme cold. Snow cover protects flower buds; there is nothing to do. Winter mulches, after the ground freezes, help root zones and anti-desiccant sprays help foliage, but there is little that can be done to protect flower buds. Blanketing hardy plants can be detrimental; it acts like a greenhouse. Plants are warmed by the sun during the day and exude moisture and when the temperature drops at night, cells freeze and often plants are killed.

If you look up ''chamber music'' in a   typical dictionary you are likely to   find references to ''small room'' or   ''domestic environment.'' Well,   there may be historical grounds for that sort of definition, but nowadays it is only the most fortunate of music lovers who get to hear a string quartet in someone's living room.   But the fact is that chamber music went public quite a long time ago. This is illustrated by the string quartets Haydn wrote in the 1790's for concert performance in London. In the ''Salomon'' quartets - named after the celebrated violinist and impresario who organized and played in the London premieres - the subtle detail of quartets written earlier for the cognoscenti of Vienna gives way where necessary to the broad effects required to make the pieces work for a somewhat wider audience. They are no less great for that, and two of them (Opus 71, number 3 in E flat, and Opus 74, number 1 in C) have been recorded in exuberant, polished performances by the appropriately-named Salomon String Quartet, on authentic instruments of the period.

At best, recycling disposables is currently in the experimental stage, is done at very few locations nationwide and is sponsored by the manufacturers.    If recycling were ever done on a large scale, I would want nothing to do with any items made with these diapers. Who separates the diapers used by AIDS babies, and where are these diapers ending up right now?   The argument of diaper services' gas usage and air pollution created by delivery trucks is extremely weak. When users of disposables replenish their supply, I am sure they do not walk to the store or ride a horse. All those extra trips multiplied by the many users of disposables cancel out and surely surpass cloth diaper services' weekly delivery.   Regarding cloth diapers as being unhealthy to use in hospitals, day care centers, etc., there is no difference between used disposables' sitting in a closed container until garbage pickup and soiled cloth diapers in a covered diaper pail. In an institutional setting, the diaper service would provide daily pickup and delivery.   Diaper leakage is a major issue in this debate, and the only one that disposables win. A friend told me her son wore disposables while swimming in the ocean. She was astounded that his diaper didn't leak.    How much liquid can one disposable hold? Too much to be considered healthy. People who care for babies can get away with fewer diaper changes when disposables are used. Many people use fewer disposables to keep costs down, when they could be using a diaper service and receiving more diapers for less money. Disposables are expensive, and changing a baby infrequently is a health hazard.    I've had three babies who wore cloth diapers, and I've never experienced a diaper \\"leak.\\" When a baby's diaper does leak, it is a signal that means \\"Change me.\\" With disposables, one never receives this signal.  Is this healthy?   Babies diapered in cloth will need to be changed more, and it does take five seconds more to diaper when using cloth. Is it too much to take a few more seconds and in return receive a cleaner environment and a healthier baby?   The worst thing is that disposable diapers are not disposable. They will still be here long after we, and our children now in diapers, are not.  EVE V.

THE FUTURE OF LIFE, by Edward O. Wilson. (Knopf, $22.)

BLOOD-DARK TRACK: A Family History, by Joseph O'Neill. (Granta, $27.95.)

SALT: A World History, by Mark Kurlansky. (Walker, $28.) There's more to salt than everybody knows; without it, people can't live. It's cheap now, and many people get too much, but that wasn't always so; Kurlansky gives the economic, political, chemical and industrial story of a substance once so valuable that ''salary'' is named for it.    HOUSE OF WOMEN, by Lynn Freed. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) Fairy-tale elements prevail in this novel in which a mother and a daughter fight to the death; Nalia, an opera singer and Holocaust survivor, reigns over Thea, who is quasi-abducted by a Bluebeardish Syrian in a narrative full of dream logic, psychoanalysis and the writing of journals for others to read.

In Peter Sollett's delicate and altogether satisfying romantic comedy, it's Victor's puffed-rice pride that always gets him into trouble. Pride is a tricky subject to make a film about. Part of what will leave you taking in all of the delights of &quot;Vargas&quot; with open-mouthed wonder comes from the director's surefooted navigating of the way pride bounces around a small, packed household. Victor lives in a tiny apartment with his family, including his stubborn, salt-of-the-earth grandmother (Altagracia Guzman).  Things get complicated when Victor starts chasing the swan-like Judy (Judy Marte) and the whole world gets involved. In the larger world, this stuff might not add up to a hill of beans, but Mr. Sollett treats the emotional shifts in the Vargas household like the movement of tectonic plates; each change rocks the characters lives. — Elvis Mitchell This Grandma's Boy Is the Ladies' Man of the Barrio"},{"year":"1994","title":"Alongside advertisements for \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" in newspaper movie sections this week are those for \\"Texas.\\" But don't look for any theater listings in the promotions","excerpt":"this film is available only on video.   \\"Texas,\\" based on the James A.

The words were neither a \\"challenge\\" to Mr. Bawer's relationship nor a \\"telling slip\\" showing subconscious disrespect. Nor were they a statement that our ability to procreate makes my husband and me qualitatively different from those involved in single-sex relationships. The words were a statement of the ardent love that my husband and I share, and a celebration of every other relationship founded on passion, friendship and honor. BONNIE G. KLEIN  Falls Church, Va. Margaret O'Brien Steinfels replies:   The letters address my proposition that \\"society has a legitimate interest in privileging those heterosexual unions that are oriented toward the generation and rearing of children,\\" but do not directly attack it. Instead, they emphasize the ways in which legal marriage departs from this role, embracing not only the infertile and adoptive, but increasingly the intentionally childless. If we've gone this far, the letter writers ask, why stop here? Why exclude gay people?   I agree that American society seems to be moving from an understanding of marriage largely in terms of family and intergenerational ties to one that emphasizes intimacy and the fulfillment of two individuals. Appealing to this movement as a precedent is not convincing to those who believe that it has already gone too far. None of the letters mention the most dramatic example of the way in which family life has changed -- namely, the rapid rise in out-of-wedlock births and children living in single-parent or no-parent households. There are people who argue that to avoid stigmatization, we should regard these nontraditional forms as normal. But this social experiment of only some 25 years' duration is failing large numbers of children and women. This underlines the enormous social benefit that comes when two people vow not only to care for each other but to sustain the kind of relationship commonly involving several decades of caring for the next generation. That is why I suspect society will want marriages recognized as qualitatively different from other relationships.   I suggested that this widespread concern remains high on the agenda for the dialogue that I believed Mr. Bawer was advancing. His letter implies that dialogue is conditional on prior agreement. He believes that warning of the psychological consequences to gay people and their families of rejection resolves the \\"family\\" issue. But nowhere does he address the social and political concerns I raise. It is here that his metaphor, \\"a place at the table,\\" misleads. No nation is one big happy family, least of all our own. Our genius has been to transcend family limitations to create a public space where all of us may interact, if only to agree to disagree. The entrance ticket is tolerance, not approval.

But the Russians have had no reluctance. They have pitched in, tooth and nail—as witness \\"This Is the Enemy!\\" an assemblage of Soviet shorts, which opened at the Stanley yesterday. No bones are made about it","excerpt":"this is a straight propagandist job, designed for no other purpose than to make people hate the Nazis and regard them as sadists and beasts. Artistically, it is crude and melodramatic beyond words—reminiscent, in fact, of some of the \\"hate the Hun\\" films of the last war. But there is no doubt that it packs a punch for susceptible audiences.\\"This Is the Enemy!\\" begins with a childish animated cartoon showing a sort of Big-Bad-Wolf Nazi striding over the map of Europe until he reaches—bang!—the Russian frontier. Thereafter follow five brief and simple dramatic episodes, originally produced as independent items by different directors and played by different casts. The first, called \\"A Drop of Milk,\\" shows how a Polish peasant, brutalized by a Nazi officer during the invasion, finally gets revenge on that same officer in later fighting on the Russian front.The next two, \\"Air Raid\\" and \\"Three in a Shellhole,\\" are but incidents to demonstrate the cowardice and duplicity of the Nazis. \\"Saboteur,\\" the fourth episode, recounts how a Russian grandmother and her small grandson outwit and capture a Nazi wrecker. And the fifth, \\"100 for One,\\" represents the manner in which a group of Yugoslav hostages turn the tables on the Nazis who mean to kill them. The picture ends with an ironic jest: Napoleon sends a telegram to Hitler.It is impossible to regard \\"This Is the Enemy!\\" as anything but a piece of demagoguery—well-intentioned, perhaps, but extreme in its theatrical method. The enemy is presented as utterly contemptible —porcine or lupine, invariably—and the heroes are stout, courageous fellows, sharp-witted and even frolicsome. Naturally, a film of this sort, with stirring music and lusty songs, will stimulate the emotions of predisposed and uncritical audiences. But one might seriously question whether this is a judicious way to arouse a popular sentiment. The most effective drama still is that which is restrained.
