The kids seemed spellbound, as well they might. For in \\"White Wilderness,\\" the fifth feature in the True-Life Adventure series, Mr. Disney has assembled a fine, often fascinating color documentary on animal life in the North American Arctic.Although a unit headed by Ben Sharpsteen, producer, and James Algar, director-writer, deserves full credit for this most picturesque and informative Buena Vista release, the five chief photographers, listed above, rate the biggest hand.These hardy camera-grinders, including one lady, are supposed to have spent three years scouting their prey, from the Canadian and Alaskan timber lines to the edge of the polar ice cap. The footage itself, obviously shot under backbreaking and even dangerous conditions, looks more like ten years of tough photographic sledding. Against a background of seasonal changes, and a sensible narration, the camera moves in for some marvelously revealing closeups of amphibians. mammals, rodents and birds in their life cycles and survival battles.Now with all due respect to pictorial achievement, the film is a bit redundant. On the whole, it has remoteness, rather than grandeur (that, say, of \\"The Living Desert\\"). And while it remains admirably ungory (parents will be happy to hear), the unending, ice-cold warfare is generally stimulating rather than thrilling.However, the performers—the animals—are simply wonderful, which is what really counts. All of the familiar ones are here, and then some: hordes of blubbery walrus","excerpt":"solicitous mother polar bears (and playful cubs); marauding ermines, jaegers, even ravens; the shaggy musk-ox, the elegant ring seal; migrant bands of caribou and reindeer. The perkiest-looking creature is an eider duck (add five young 'uns). As pretty an underwater ballet as one could imagine is swum by a school of white Beluga whales.Surprisingly, the most domestic family portrait is that of the wolf (not, we learn, the legendary professional killer). One \\"tuning-up\\" session, showing some young howlers is disarming, and typical of humor that never gets out of hand.One eerie, hypnotic sequence shows a colony of lemmings making their traditional, mysterious \\"death march\\" to the sea, where the jittery little mammals sail off a cliff like tiny parachutes. With the appearance of the meanest Arctic denizen of all, the wolverine, the picture moves toward a spectacular finale, as a wolf pack invades a pounding tide of caribou.Obviously, such a movie is worth anyone's time, young or old. If \\"White Wilderness\\" seems to be only a superior film, rather than a distinguished one, blame it on the high standards previously set by Mr. Disney. And, as a matter of fact, \\"Ama Girls,\\" a Disney color short subject on the same program dealing with life in a Japanese fishing village, is well worth a viewer's time, too.

This is constantly being made evident in French films.That is why one may wonder how the fellow played by Henry Vidal in the French film, \\"What Price Murder\\" (\\"Une Manche et la Belle\\"), which opened at the Trans-Lux Fifty-second Street yesterday, could ever let himself get tangled in a supposedly perfect-murder plot with a dame as obviously dangerous as the one played here by Mylene Demongeot.Doesn't the fellow ever go to French movies, such as \\"Une Manche et la Belle\\"?Here he is, comfortably married with a wealthy French widow, who may not be as beautiful as her secretary (Mlle. Demongeot) but who happens to be played by Isa Miranda. They live in a luxurious villa overlooking the Mediterranean and have a yacht. What's more, the beautiful secretary is available to take dictation on her nights off.Why, then, should this fellow, who is plainly nobody's dunce, let himself be tricked by the secretary into an intrigue to murder his wife? There is only one logical answer: Mlle. Demongeot.Even though the New York state censors do not permit us to see so much of this lissom blonde charmer as the French were permitted to scan (there is one key scene on a bathing raft that has obviously been trimmed), we do see enough of her cool beauty and her seductive way with a man to understand the panting abandon of the chap played by M. Vidal. She's a girl to drive any guy ga-ga—and that's what she does to him.Blessed with a look of dewdrencher innocence and the talent to convey the mischief of a wasp, this Mlle, Demongeot is someone to beware, enjoy—and watch.And so, amid elegant surroundings, in Venice and on the Cote d'Azur, and under the polished direction of clever old Henri Verneuil, she baits M. Vidal with soft seductions and lures him into a plot to dispose of Miss Miranda, only to—that we won't tell!The plot, lifted more or less precisely from a novel by James Hadley Chase, is nothing particularly ingenious—just a routine deception to make it look as though the victim had lost control of her auto while driving on the Grand Corniche. But it is played with considerable tension and a flash of gruesome detail that gives Miss Miranda her best chance for a smashing effect in the film.\\"What Price Murder\\" is solid, as murder melodramas go, and it is particularly distinguished by the presence of a bright new girl.

High real estate costs and strict land use regulations have for years prompted companies to shift operations out of the valley, an area south of San Francisco that is home to many computer and semiconductor companies. But it is only recently that executives came to any kind of consensus about the damage these moves have caused.

Then again, it is difficult to make hard-and-fast recommendations among a number of good, solid performances.

The title comes from the name of a wooden stick or block that can be used as a percussion instrument. Appropriately, a recording of Steve Reich's \\"Music for Pieces of Wood\\" serves as the accompaniment.   By Mr. Feld's design, the score's ceaseless clackings set Buffy Miller's wrists flicking and shoulders shaking. His choreographic responses to the music were fascinatingly varied. There were moments in which Ms. Miller moved in harmonious partnership with the sound. At other times, the music seemed to take control, tugging her from side to side. Sequences of twitches even suggested that she was being pelted by a hailstorm of percussion. But the sonic assaults left her undefeated.

Most of the great soul singers, from Smokey Robinson to Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin to Al Green, have acknowledged Mr. Cooke as a primary influence, but most of his recordings were tailored for a broad pop audience. Until the release of ''One Night Stand,'' his only live album was ''Sam Cooke at the Copa,'' a set of sophisticated supper-club soul.

The Solti-Chicago phenomenon of the early 1970's, which has since lost some of its luster, owed much to the orchestra's sensational concerts in Carnegie Hall and the publicity they generated. As a transplanted Midwesterner who came east in 1970, I recall not only the clamorous enthusiasm that greeted the orchestra and its new maestro at the time in Carnegie, but also the relatively restrained reception accorded them on comparable evenings at Orchestra Hall in Chicago.   And to an unexpected degree, the nature of this week's programs enhanced the resonance of the occasion. The concert version of Verdi's \\"Otello\\" with Luciano Pavarotti on Tuesday and Friday evenings was, of course, planned long ago. But the program for Monday and Thursday originally coupled the New York premiere of Sir Michael Tippett's \\"Byzantium\\" with Beethoven's Third Symphony, which was belatedly replaced by Mahler's Fifth, a vintage Solti-Chicago blockbuster.

When Mr. Solti conducted the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall on Saturday night, profound meditation and revelatory vision were conspicuously absent. There was little mystery, not much humor and certainly no tenderness in this recitation of Wagner, Liszt and Berlioz. In their place was energy -- a visceral force of remarkable dimensions marshaled for specific purposes and aimed with fanatic precision.   The Prelude and \\"Liebestod\\" from \\"Tristan und Isolde\\" at this pension fund benefit was not so much performed as stalked, pounced upon and eaten alive. There is something of the predatory feline in Mr. Solti's presence: the calculating gleam of eye, the agile aggressiveness of gesture, a hint of menace that is slightly thrilling. The Philharmonic players followed Mr. Solti, eager but nervous and not always together at entrances. Was he hungry for them as well as Wagner? One couldn't be too careful.

With Verdi or Wagner operas, one might quibble about editions and details, but the composers' fully orchestrated scores are solid foundations on which performances can be built. But with Monteverdi and his contemporaries, surviving scores present the music in shorthand, with instrumentation and scoring niceties left to circumstance, and fragments of competing versions clouding the picture. The questions \\"What should be done here?\\" and \\"How?\\" can be daunting for musicians used to being guided by the composers' expressed wishes.    The student singers and musicians of the Juilliard Opera Center have been puzzling over Monteverdi's 1642 opera, \\"L'Incoronazione di Poppea,\\" with musicological prodding from Gary Wedow (who, in turn, based his realization on Alan Curtis's 1990 edition of the work) and staging by Frank Corsaro. They presented their solution on Wednesday night and last night, and will do so again tomorrow afternoon at the Juilliard Theater.

For more than 200 years, historians have argued over whether the son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette might have escaped from prison after his parents were guillotined during the French Revolution. The dispute spawned hundreds of pretenders to the throne, one of whom was convincing enough to get the government of Netherlands to bury him under a tombstone indicating that he was the true heir to the French throne.

Both are celebrated for their crime fiction but, rooted in their own cultures and periods, each would be out of place in the other's world. As their avid readers can attest, detective stories provide more than puzzles to be solved. As do the presumably loftier forms of fiction, they reflect with uncanny accuracy the spirit and structure of their times.    Returning tonight for a fifth season on public television's \\"Mystery\\" series, \\"Poirot,\\" set in the 1920's and 30's, takes place in an England where class distinctions were not only accepted but were carefully preserved, as well. Miss Christie is always partial to the upper classes and their stately homes. Their privileges are taken for granted. Outsiders, especially Americans, always tend to be suspect. The author's detective, Hercule Poirot, a Belgian, is accepted in the highest social circles not just because he is so infernally clever but also because he is even more finicky and snobbish than the British aristocrats.

K. Rowling's books, had a huge opening at theaters this weekend, with $101.4 million in ticket sales, according to box office estimates. Not only is that figure an improvement over the previous installment, ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' which opened with $93.7 million a year and a half ago, it has also now displaced that film for the fourth-highest-grossing opening weekend in box-office history, behind ''Spider-Man,'' ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith'' and ''Shrek 2.'' The No. 2 movie this weekend was ''Walk the Line'' (Fox), which stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon as Johnny and June Carter Cash. It took in $22.4 million. No other major films dared compete with ''Harry Potter'' and ''Walk the Line''","excerpt":"some 72 percent of the audience for the top 12 films since Friday went to one or the other. The animated ''Chicken Little'' (Buena Vista), featuring the voices of Zach Braff, Garry Marshall, Joan Cusack and Steve Zahn, among others, was No. 3, with $14.8 million in ticket sales; now in its third week of release, it has taken in a total of $99 million. ''Derailed'' (Weinstein Company), a thriller starring Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston, reached No. 4 with $6.5 million in its second week out, and the space adventure ''Zathura'' (Sony) landed at No. 5 with $5.1 million. Thanks to ''Harry Potter,'' the box office was up a remarkable 53.6 percent over last weekend, and 19.5 percent over the same weekend last year.    Pollock and Warhol Artworks Stolen       An oil painting by Jackson Pollock and a silkscreen by Andy Warhol have been stolen from the Everhart Museum in Scranton, Penn., by thieves who shattered a glass door in the back of the building, The Associated Press reported. The Pollock, ''Springs Winter'' from 1949, was on loan from a private collector and was worth about $11.6 million, experts said. Warhol's ''Grande Passion,'' created in 1984 for an ad campaign for Grand Passion cognac, was owned by the museum and had a value of about $15,000. The thieves had disappeared by the time the police arrived -- four minutes after the alarm sounded at 2:30 a.m. on Friday. Surveillance cameras were not working, and investigators said the thieves appeared to have been aided by a large tent covering the museum's back entrance for an event. Officials said they had no immediate leads.    Rocker Arrested in Vietnam       Gary Glitter, the 1970's British glam-rock singer, was arrested in Vietnam on Saturday over allegations that he had indulged in lewd acts with under-age girls, a state-run newspaper reported yesterday. He was stopped while preparing to board a flight to Bangkok from Ho Chi Minh City, after an officer recognized the name in his passport from press reports, according to a newspaper article in The Tuoi Tre. The Associated Press said a police officer in Vung Tau, the city on the southern coast where Mr. Glitter, below, had been living in a rented house since March, confirmed that he had been detained for further investigation. Mr. Glitter, 61, whose real name is Paul Francis Gadd, was convicted in Britain in 1999 of possessing child pornography. He later went to Cambodia, which expelled him in 2002, though officials there did not specify a reason.    Rundgren Joins Cars       Todd Rundgren, below, the veteran singer and record producer, is to join two members of the Cars, Elliot Easton and Greg Hawkes, for a new incarnation of the band, Billboard reported. Mr. Rundgren will stand in for Ric Ocasek, who said he has no plans to participate in the project. The group is to tour and possibly record an album next year. The original band split up in early 1988 after 12 years. Ben Orr, the bassist and one of the singers, died of cancer in 2000.    Shaolin Reality       The ancient Shaolin Temple in Henan Province, China, is have its own television show called ''Chinese Kung Fu Star Search'' that will invite viewers to vote for their favorite martial arts masters, the BBC reported. Judges and viewers will rank contestants by virtue, kung fu technique and artistry until they settle on the final 108 contestants, the same number as the rebellious heroes from the classic Chinese novel ''Outlaws of the Marsh.'' The finalists will then get the chance to perform in a big-budget movie and television series based on stories from the 1,500-year-old temple, which has inspired countless movies in the Chinese-speaking world. Contestants must be male, and Shaolin monks are not allowed to take part. The series is part of the abbot Shi Yongxin's efforts to promote the temple.    Global Sounds       The next installment of GlobalFest, the annual festival of up-to-the-minute world music at the Public Theater, will take place on Jan. 21 and 22, with the same acts performing both nights. The lineup includes Daara J, a rap group from Senegal; Lura, from Cape Verde; Émil Zrihan, from Morocco; Keren Ann, Juan Carmona and Las Ondas Marteles from France; Daby Touré, from Mauritania; DJ Dolores, from Brazil; Auktyon, from Russia; Niyaz, with members from Iran and India; and two American bands, Frank London's Klezmer Brass All-Stars and Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys.
