The company, Easel Corporation of Woburn, Mass., will move into the first of the buildings, a $21 million four-story, 125,000-square-foot concrete, granite and glass structure now nearing completion. The building was designed by the Urban Design Group of Chicago.   Trammell Crow Company of Dallas, the developer of the $95 million project, is planning 635,000 square feet of office space, 35,000 square feet of retail space and 75 to 100 town- house units. Construction of the town houses is to begin next year, said Richard A. Galvin, vice president of Trammell Crow's Boston office, but no date has been set for the remaining buildings.   Planning for Burlington Center began in 1984 when the developer proposed an office park of about 1 million square feet. The town denied the permit, objecting that the project was too large.   The developer went to court but decided instead to become the first to use a local planning tool introduced in 1987, the Planned Development District, which allows a variety of uses on land zoned for a single use on a case-by-case basis.   Trammell Crow, town officials and abutting residents came up with the final design, which includes housing on land zoned for industrial use. The plan added the retail and residential space and, at the town's request, extensive traffic, sewer and drainage improvements. The plan was approved in January 1988.    There was little commercial or industrial development here until the 1970's. Since then, businesses and institutions have been attracted by the abundance of commercially and industrially zoned land and the town's convenient location on Route 128, the high-tech beltway around Boston. In the last two years, about 1.5 million square feet of commercial projects have gone up, according to the Planning Director, Terry S. Szold. But since 1987 the town has imposed stricter controls to limit the density of some projects and has introduced greater local scrutiny in planning.    Financing for land acquisition and infrastructure work was provided through Kennedy Associates Real Estate Advisers of Seattle.   The Bank of New England provided the $21 million construction loan for the first building and permanent financing will come from the Multi-Employer Property Trust, a pool of union pension funds advised by Kennedy Associates, Mr. Galvin said.

This hard-learned policy is being resisted fiercely by the very people whose pro-Arab assurances brought us into a shooting war.      At the C.I.A.   , operatives have sought an excuse for agency failures to anticipate terrorist attacks by bemoaning the loss of our P.L.O. undercover dealings, which in effect tolerated terrorism as long as it was not aimed at the U.S. But two years ago, P.L.O. double agents sold our C.I.A. a phony tale of a Libyan hit team supposedly on the way to the U.S., making Mr. Reagan's Administration look to the world like a bunch of nervous Nellies.

Although historical records show Christus was a successful and wealthy painter, admitted to the highest circles of society, quite soon after his death toward the end of the century his art was all but forgotten. In the 1820's he was rediscovered, only to be brushed aside in this century by art historians like Max Friedlander and Erwin Panofsky as a weak hanger-on of van Eyck. PETRUS CHRISTUS: Renaissance Master of Bruges (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Abrams, $60) teases out the obviously derivative elements of Christus's small oeuvre from his perhaps minor but nonetheless significant contributions to Renaissance Flemish panel painting. As Maryan W. Ainsworth, a senior research fellow at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, shows in her scholarly essay, Christus married his intimate knowledge of illumination techniques to the new medium of oil painting. His often diminutive, richly detailed panels shimmer with color. Ms. Ainsworth's painstaking examination of the artist's technique, aided by scientific analyses of the underpaintings, quite conclusively distinguishes Christus's slightly dreamy artistic sensibility from that of the what-you-see-is-what-you-get realism of van Eyck. However, in her zeal to restore Christus's status as an original artist, the author sometimes glosses over his obvious deficiencies -- Christus's portraits (which, although expertly executed, do tend to look alike) are described as \\"consistent in their physiognomy.\\" However, while the book sometimes plunges the layman deep into the arcane world of art conservation with its abstruse terminology, it does succeed in bringing to life not just the work of Christus, but also his richly adorned (and beautifully painted) world of the 15th century's wealthy and devout.\\nSIRI HUNTOON IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"Small Wonders"},{"year":"1962","title":"WATER gardening with containers enables any gardener to enjoy the fascinating beauty of hardy and some tropical waterlilies.

At least nine teams have realistic aspirations of winning the championship. And the majority of the contenders are in the Western Conference. Even some coaches in the Eastern Conference admit that the balance of power has shifted to the West.    \\"You could be an awfully good team in the West this year and struggle just to make the playoffs,\\" said Stu Jackson, the Knicks' coach.    Here is a capsule look at all 27 teams. Statistics are from last season.  WESTERN CONFERENCE: MIDWEST DIVISION San Antonio Spurs Quick Recap: 56-26 record last season, lost to Portland in second round of the playoffs. New Faces: David Greenwood (free agent from Detroit), Sean Higgins (54th pick in the draft), Tony Massenburg (43d pick), Paul Pressey (in trade from Milwaukee), Dwayne Schintzius (24th pick). Top Guns: David Robinson (24.3 points, 12 rebounds, 3.8 blocks), Terry Cummings (22.4 pts.), Willie Anderson (15.7 pts.), Pressey (11 pts.), Rod Strickland (10.6 pts.), Sean Elliott (10 pts.). Game Plan: Robinson should only get better, a frightening thought for the rest of the league. Depth is the biggest question mark, but Pressey should help in that department. This team has enough talent to win a championship if it shows the maturity to withstand playoff pressure.  Utah Jazz Quick Recap: 55-27, lost to Phoenix in opening round of playoffs. New Faces: Jeff Malone (in trade from Washington), Walter Palmer (33d pick). Top Guns: Karl Malone (31 pts., 56.2 percent field-goal average, 11.1 rebs.), Jeff Malone (24.3 pts.), John Stockton (17.2 pts., 14.5 assists, 2.6 steals, 41.6% on 3-pointers), Thurl Bailey (14.2 pts.), Mark Eaton (2.4 blocks). Game Plan: Jeff Malone, one of the game's best outside shooters, will give the Jazz more diversity. Utah still lacks a strong bench, but it may not matter because Stockton and the two Malones are so good. If this team loses in the first round of the playoffs for a third consecutive season, it may cost Coach Jerry Sloan his job.  Dallas Mavericks Quick Recap: 47-35, lost to Portland in first round of playoffs. New Faces: Alex English (free agent from Denver), Phil Henderson (49th pick), Fat Lever (in trade from Denver), Rodney McCray (in trade from Sacramento). Top Guns: Rolando Blackman (19.4 pts.), Lever (18.3 pts., 2.1 steals, 41% on 3-pointers), Derek Harper (18 pts., 2.2 steals), English (17.9 pts.), Roy Tarpley (16.8 pts.), McCray (16.6 pts.). Game Plan: No team helped itself more during the off season. Lever, English and McCray will benefit from joining a better team. If Tarpley's drug problems are behind him, Dallas is a contender.  Houston Rockets Quick Recap: 41-41, lost to Lakers in first round of playoffs. New Faces: Carl Herrera (30th pick), Dave Jamerson (15th pick), Roy Marble (in trade from Atlanta), Kenny Smith (in trade from Atlanta). Top Guns: Akeem Olajuwon (24.3 pts., 2.1 steals, 14 rebs., 4.5 blocks), Otis Thorpe (17.1 pts., 54.8% f.g.), Buck Johnson (14.8 pts.), Sleepy Floyd (12.2 pts.)","excerpt":"Smith (11.9 pts.). Game Plan: Houston won 46 games in 1987-88, 42 games in 1988-89 and 41 games last season. Do you see a pattern? Olajuwon is one of the game's great players, but his career is being wasted on an average team. He may carry Houston to the playoffs, but he is unlikely to take them much further. Denver Nuggets Quick Recap: 43-39, lost to San Antonio in first round of playoffs. New Faces: Chris Jackson (third pick), Marcus Liberty (42d pick), Paul Westhead (coach, was the coach at Loyola Marymount University), Orlando Woolridge (in trade from Los Angeles Lakers). Top Guns: Walter Davis (17.5 pts., 91.2% free-throw average), Michael Adams (15.5 pts.), Woolridge (12.7 pts., 55.6% f.g.), Blair Rasmussen (12.4 pts.). Game Plan: Westhead hopes his high-octane offense camouflages a lack of depth. Denver traded away its top two scorers, which puts more pressure on Jackson. The Nuggets may be the first league team to score 200 points or to allow 200 points in a game. But winning will be much more difficult than scoring.  Minnesota Timberwolves Quick Recap: 22-60, failed to make playoffs. New Faces: Scott Brooks (in trade from Philadelphia), Gerald Glass (20th pick), Felton Spencer (sixth pick). Top Guns: Tony Campbell (23.2 pts.), Tyrone Corbin (14.7 pts., 2.1 steals), Sam Mitchell (12.7 pts.), Pooh Richardson (11.4 pts.). Game Plan: The best of the four recent expansion teams. Nobody enjoys playing the Timberwolves because of their tenacious defense and enthusiastic fans. If Glass and Spencer have solid rookie seasons, the 30-victory mark is within reach.  Orlando Magic Quick Recap: 18-64, failed to make playoffs. New Faces: Greg Kite (free agent from Sacramento), Dennis Scott (fourth pick). Top Guns: Terry Catledge (19.4 pts.), Otis Smith (13.5 pts.), Jerry Reynolds (12.8 pts.), Nick Anderson (11.5 pts.), Sam Vincent (11.2 pts.), Sidney Green (10.4 pts.). Game Plan: The Magic lacks two essentials for winning teams: defense and a quality center. No team in the league surrendered more points last season. Switch in divisions will mean more travel and more fatigue. It may also mean fewer victories. PACIFIC DIVISION Portland Trail Blazers Quick Recap: 59-23 record last season, lost to Detroit in the league championship series. New Faces: Alaa Abdelnaby (25th pick), Danny Ainge (in trade from Sacramento). Top Guns: Clyde Drexler (23.3 pts.), Ainge (17.9 pts.), Terry Porter (17.6 pts., 89.2% f.t., 9.1 asts.), Kevin Duckworth (16.2 pts.), Jerome Kersey (16 pts.), Buck Williams (13.6 pts., 54.8% f.g., 9.8 rebs.), Drazen Petrovic (45.9% on 3-pointers). Game Plan: Many people think Portland's starting five has more talent than any other team's. The Blazers were the league's best rebounding team; they have the versatility to be effective playing either up-tempo or halfcourt, and adding Ainge gives Portland a three-guard rotation that rivals Detroit's. Bench depth was the team's only weakness, but Ainge will help, and Cliff Robinson should be more effective in his second season. A serious threat to end the Lakers' 11-year reign as division champions.  Los Angeles Lakers Quick Recap: 63-19, lost to Phoenix in second round of playoffs. New Faces: Elden Campbell (27th pick), Mike Dunleavy (coach, was a Milwaukee assistant), Sam Perkins (free agent from Dallas), Tony Smith (51st pick), Terry Teagle (in trade from Golden State). Top Guns: Magic Johnson (22.3 pts., 89% f.t., 11.5 asts.), James Worthy (21.1 pts., 54.8% f.g.), Teagle (16.1 pts.), Perkins (15.9 pts.), Byron Scott (15.5 pts., 42.3% on 3-pointers), A.: C. Green (12.9 pts.), Mychal Thompson (10.1 pts.). Game Plan: By acquiring Perkins and Teagle, Jerry West continues to show why he may be basketball's best general manager. Dunleavy wants the Lakers to run more than last season, and they still have the legs to do it. If his defense improves, Vlade Divac will start at center in place of Thompson; if it doesn't, Perkins might. Scott is finally 100 percent again, and Johnson still has tricks up his sleeve. The team of the 80's remains a championship contender in the 90's.  Phoenix Suns Quick Recap: 54-28, lost to Portland in Western Conference finals. New Faces: Cedric Ceballos (48th pick), Negele Knight (31st pick), Ed Nealy (free agent from Chicago). Top Guns: Tom Chambers (27.2 pts.), Kevin Johnson (22.5 pts., 11.4 asts.), Jeff Hornacek (17.6 pts.), Eddie Johnson (16.9 pts., 91.7% f.t.), Dan Majerle (11.1 pts.), Mark West (10.5 pts., 62.5% f.g., 2.2 blocks). Game Plan: After shocking Lakers in the playoffs, the Suns lost four games to Portland by a total of 12 points. Phoenix relies on its speed and athleticism, but Nealy was acquired to help it become more physical. Talent virtually guarantees another 50-victory season, but whether Suns are tough enough to reach league finals remains to be seen.  Los Angeles Clippers Quick Recap: 30-52, failed to make playoffs. New Faces: Bo Kimble (eighth pick), Mike Schuler (coach, is a former Portland coach), Loy Vaught (13th pick). Top Guns: Ron Harper (22.8 pts.), Charles Smith (21.1 pts.), Danny Manning (16.3 pts.), Ken Norman (16.1 pts.), Benoit Benjamin (13.5 pts., 2.6 blocks), Gary Grant (13.1 pts., 10 asts.). Game Plan: Harper is not scheduled to return from knee surgery until January, but Grant has recovered from his broken leg. Schuler has a reputation for being too intense, but he never had a losing record in 2 1/2 seasons coaching Portland. Believe it or not, if they stay healthy, the Clippers finally have too much talent not to make a strong run at the playoffs. The last time this franchise made the playoffs was in 1976, when they were called the Buffalo Braves.  Seattle SuperSonics Quick Recap: 41-41, failed to make playoffs. New Faces: K.: C. Jones (coach, a former Celtic coach by way of Seattle front office), Gary Payton (second pick). Top Guns: Dale Ellis (23.5 pts.), Xavier McDaniel (21.3 pts.), Derrick McKey (15.7 pts.), Sedale Threatt (11.4 pts.). Game Plan: It won't take Jones long to realize he is not coaching Boston anymore. Seattle lacks an effective center; it is a poor passing team, and the bench is unproven. Payton may provide leadership at point guard, but he is a rookie. Again, it looks as if Seattle's season will end when the playoffs begin.  Golden State Warriors Quick Recap: 37-45, failed to make playoffs. New Faces: Tyrone Hill (11th pick), Les Jepsen (28th pick), Kevin Pritchard (34th pick). Top Guns: Chris Mullin (25.1 pts., 88.9% f.t.,), Mitch Richmond (22.1 pts.), Tim Hardaway, (14.1 pts., 8.7 asts., 2 steals), Sarunas Marciulionis (12.1 pts.), Rod Higgins (11.1 pts.). Game Plan: Opponents took advantage of the Warriors' small lineup last season, so they drafted the big men Hill and Jepsen. Golden State led the league in scoring, so offense is not a problem. But this division may be the league's best, meaning the Warriors will struggle just to make the playoffs. Sacramento Kings Quick Recap: 23-59, failed to make playoffs. New Faces: Anthony Bonner (23d pick), Duane Causwell (18th pick), Bobby Hansen (in trade from Utah), Byron Irvin (in trade from Portland), Eric Leckner (in trade from Utah), Travis Mays (14th pick), Lionel Simmons (seventh pick), Rory Sparrow (in trade from Miami), Bill Wennington (in trade from Dallas). Top Guns: Wayman Tisdale (22.3 pts., Antoine Carr (12.3 pts.). Game Plan: After seven consecutive losing seasons, the Kings didn't just clean house; they demolished it and built a new one. With so many new players, Coach Dick Motta faces the stiff challenge of molding them into winning a unit. It will take a few years. But give the Kings credit for trying a new approach.
