The chorus chants its plea, \\"Domine,\\" with a descending minor second, an interval that haunts this deliberately primitive and fervently devout composition. Composed of passages from the Psalms, the work was written in honor of Pope John Paul II's first pilgrimage to his native Poland. It is a post-modern plea for succor in times of trouble, a theme that in 1979 had political as well as religious ramifications.   As part of the Manhattan School of Music's Festival of 20th-Century Music at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine on Friday night, it also had another function. With John Nelson leading the Manhattan School of Music Philharmonia along with the New York Choral Society (John Daly Goodwin, director), and with the bass Nikita Storojev, it was one of three works that served to introduce the composer to New York audiences who, until now, had only heard his music in isolated performances. The composer himself was in attendance and was welcomed at concert's end with an ovation that testified to the music's immediate power.
