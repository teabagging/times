For now, he has commemorated what must have been a rather traumatic act of expatriation with a momentarily startling, ultimately indulgent two-part installation piece titled \\"20 Years of Loneliness\\" at the Marian Goodman Gallery on West 57th Street.

The first item is \\"Antarctic Crossing,\\" a fifty-minute documentary account of Sir Vivian Fuchs' Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1957-58, and the second is \\"The Girls Are Willing,\\" a colorful Danish comedy.The geography of the documentary is clearly specified. It is that of the frozen Antarctic continent the Fuchs expedition traversed. And it is this that constitutes the challenge, the complication or the \\"villain\\" in the piece, with its obstructions of snow-piled mountains, saw-toothed glaciers, deadly crevasses and killing cold.Actually, \\"Antarctic Crossing\\" doesn't show us any more of the formidable nature of that region than has been impressively revealed in the excellent color film account of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition of 1946-47, \\"The Secret Land.\\" Again, it is a color picture record of rugged men building huts in the snow, living in them through the dark of winter, coming out with the first light of spring and setting off across the jagged, frozen landscape with dog sleds, airplanes and tractor trains.The endless fields of snow are just as barren, the glaciers are just as cruel and the plunge of an orange tractor into a crevasse is still awesome and sickening. The Antarctic assailed by the Fuchs expedition is the same as that assailed by the expedition of Admiral Byrd.The chief contribution of this picture is the tacit account it gives of the evident rivalry between Sir Vivian and Sir Edmund Hillary, who was officially detailed to assist him by laying down supply bases from the other side of the continent. However, when that was accomplished, \\"Hillary decided\\" (as the narrator says) to take out with his team for the South Pole and beat Sir Vivian there, thus becoming the first explorer since Capt. Robert Scott to reach the pole overland.It is notable that Sir Edmund is shown only a few times in this film, without identification, while the attention and emphasis are placed upon Sir Vivian and his difficulties, which are fearful and dramatic, indeed.As a record of real adventure and personal drama, \\"Antarctic Crossing\\" is something to see.The Danish film \\"The Girls Are Willing\\" (\\"Guld Og Gronne Skove\\") shows geography of a much different sort. Its scene is a genuine and charming little island off the Danish coast—a veritable picture-postcard island, made more beautiful by excellent color photography—on which is played a little comedy romance that has a cute geographical twist.Three young men of this hidebound island want to marry three sisters of a rival neighboring isle, but are forbidden by the maidens' father, until it is suspected that the first island sits upon a dome of oil and an American crew, led by a noisy Texan, arrives to drill.The cultural manifestations of the Americans—bigness and brassiness, chewing gum, soft drinks, jazz music and office signs reading THINK—are humorously contrasted with the stodginess of the islanders. And eventually the Americans are recruited to assist the success of the romance.Let us say the direction of Gabriel Axel is not the frothiest. Mr. Axel treats the amusing situation with the deftness of a guy swinging a club. But his people are nice to look at, especially the three girls, and the whole film has a healthy air about it. There are English subtitles and some accented English dialogue.

Some day some one will make a picture in which detectives don't wear derbies.It will be interesting to see what is done on the screen with Leonard Merrick's \\"Conrad in Quest of His Youth,\\" which William De Mille is making into a motion picture with a cast headed by Thomas Meighan, Kathlyn Williams and Margaret Loomis, for Paramount-Artcraft issue. One would not naturally think of Conrad's charming sentimental journey as material for a photoplay, and those who love Mr. Merrick's work will view with something of alarm the effort to picturize it. However, as Bernard Shaw and others have said, \\"You never can tell,\\" and, anyhow, it will be interesting to see what Mr. De Mille, the brother of the other, has done.\\"Many Troubles Beset Director of Serial,\\" runs the headline on an incautious sheet of press copy.The punishment made to fit the crime?Douglas Fairbanks's next picture, \\"The Mollycoddle,\\" has been completed so far as camera work goes and will be released next month. According to Douglas's brother and general manager, John, the picture cost \\"just a few dollars short of half a million,\\" not counting the doctor's bill for repairing the abundant Douglas after four injuries received in the performance of his cinematic duty.Fairbanks has a new leading lady in the picture, Ruth Renick, who was recently seen with Wallace Reid in \\"Hawthorne of the U. S. A.,\\" and among the others in the cast are Wallace Beery, Betty Bouton, Adele Farrington, Albert MacQuarrie and George Stewart, brother of the better known Anita.Far-away regions of the world are becoming more and more attractive to venturesome cameramen, it seems, and those who have unsatisfied desires to go everywhere and see everything should be thankful accordingly, for when Mohammed cannot go to the Mountain the motion-picture machine may bring the Mountain to him with exciting results.E. Alexander Powell, who is out on the far road for the Goldwyn Company, sent the following word to his office recently:\\"Aboard coast guard cutter Negros. At Sandaken, capital of British North Borneo—the world's jumping-off place—five degrees from the equator—13,000 miles from Broadway—110 in the shade (and no shade)—first motion-picture camera ever seen in North Borneo. Bubonic plague and various assorted fevers—elephant herd within three miles of town—snake twenty-six feet long killed under Judge's house last week—headhunters still doing business in the interior—crocodiles under the town wharves—orang-utangs captured daily—cockroaches as large as mice—whisky a dollar a bottle—have taken about 6,000 feet but cannot ship before Singapore—leaving tomorrow for Dutch Borneo and Celebes.Another traveler, Burton Holmes, has sailed on a three months' tour of the Near East, Turkey, Spain and Bohemia, with Jerusalem, Constantinople and Prague included principally in the itinerary.

The pictures obtained will be distributed via the Paramount route.The first of a series of motion pictures of the lower Pacific, which the Paramount South Sea Expedition went 15,000 miles in the 125-foot auxiliary power yacht Ajax to obtain, have reached New York and will be released in the Paramount Magazine in June.The latest bulletins of the National Motion Picture League indorse, with certain cuts specified, the following \\"instructional films\\":Sir Ernest Shackleton's \\"The Bottom of the World\\" (Robertson-Cole), \\"In Happy Alsace\\" (Burton Holmes-Paramount), \\"Friends of Men\\" (Kineto), \\"Charles Urban's Movie Chats No. 3\\" (Kineto), \\"In and Out of Kongo San\\" (Outing-Chester), \\"Playthings of Childhood\\" (Ford-Goldwyn), \\"The Stranger's Friend\\" (Bray-Goldwyn), \\"Home of the Seminoles\\" (Ford-Goldwyn), \\"Plenty of Beef on the Orinoco\\" (Bray-Goldwyn), \\"Heart of the Sky Mountains\\" (Prizma-Select), \\"Count Leo Tolstoi\\" (Beseler).The League, which held its annual conference at the Russell Sage Foundation Building Friday and yesterday, is planning an expansion of its work by which it hopes to increase the number of its local branches so that more people may have the benefit of the information about pictures gathered by its Review Committee and printed in its weekly bulletin. The committee has made arrangements to see all pictures made for national distribution. Mrs. S. Hodgson, recently a social worker in Mexico, has taken charge of the Local Branch Department of the League, whose offices are at 381 Fourth Avenue.An innovation in the program of the Rivoli Theatre last week was an organ overture played by Professor Firmin Swinnen, the organist of the house. It was Widor's Fifth Symphony, arranged for the organ and orchestra by Frank Stewart Adams of the Rialto.Richard Le Gallienne, poet","excerpt":"Anthony Paul Kelly, scenarist; Larry Evans, story writer, and William Huribut, playwright, have been engaged by the Frohman Amusement Corporation to write four scenarios each for translation into moving pictures.Wilbur Finley Fauley's novel, \\"Jenny Be Good,\\" has been made into a motion picture, with Mary Miles Minter in the leading rôle, and a cast including Sylvia Ashton, Jay Belasco and Margaret Shelby.A motion-picture reporter sometimes gets dizzy trying to keep up with the seemingly erratic activities of screen folk. Here not long ago it was announced that Tarkington Baker, formerly general manager of Universal, was to produce pictures independently, and had obtained the services of his cousin, Booth Tarkington, as photoplay author. Now comes the report that Mr. Baker is to go to Bombay with Frank Meyer to inaugurate the work of the Indian Empire Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, which will produce motion pictures for world circulation. Mr. Baker will remain in Bombay, it is said, as the general representative of the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation.Apparently the Booth Tarkington-Baker-made pictures have been indefinitely postponed.The United States Senate and the House of Representatives have passed the bill introduced by Congressman Walsh of Massachusetts, at the request of the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry, which amends the Penal Code by placing motion picture films in the classification with books and other printed matter. If the President signs the bill it will be a misdemeanor to ship in interstate commerce, or in the United States mail, any indecent or immoral film, just as it is a misdemeanor now to ship an indecent book.It is the contention of the National Association that there should be no discrimination in censorship and other matters between the printed word and the printed picture. The printed word, it is maintained, is protected from censorship by a provision of the Federal Constitution, as well as by every State Constitution, and the same protection is sought for motion pictures.\\"The enactment of this law,\\" according to the association, \\"will also be an answer to those persons who are asking for new laws for what they call the 'protection' of the screen. Any person exhibiting any indecent or immoral film can be prosecuted not only under the laws of his State, but, if the film is sent from another State, he can also be prosecuted in the Federal courts.\\"A FRENCH FILM.J'ACCUSE\\" is the title of a French motion picture that seems to have aroused the interest, and, on the whole, the approval of the London reviewers. It is not an adaptation of the widely known book of the same name, which appeared early in the war, but is the work of Abel Gance, who, apparently, both wrote and produced it. Writing of the picture in The London Daily Mall, \\"C. R.\\" said:Imagine the men who fell in the war leaving their graves and marching home to see if those left behind were worthy of such a sacrifice: That is the task a French producer has set himself in a new film called \\"J'Accuse.\\" The way he has shown it on the screen is worthy of the awe-inspiring subject.A young poet and visionary has gone mad through the horrible sights he has seen in the trenches, and continually imagines that he sees this procession of the heroic dead. He summons his neighbors, and with the seeming sanity of the madman tells them their lost loved ones are approaching, and asks them if they are worthy. The scene is so vivid that one feels that his hearers believe him, and the faithless wife and the profiteers bow their heads in shame.The film is really a cold record of the ugly side of war. It shows the joy in the villages at the proclamation of war and the thought of avenging 1870. Then the grief of parting—no faces are seen, only the convulsive hand-clasp—and gradually the unfolding of the horrors of trench life.Through the film runs the story of an unhappily married wife whose husband and lover are in the same regiment, and in the hour of crisis become the strongest friends.Alder Andersen, the motion-picture reviewer of The Daily Telegraph, wrote:\\"J'Accuse,\\" for which the author has adopted the title made famous by Emile Zola more than a score of years ago, is a scathing indictment of those who deliberately provoked the greatest catastrophe in history and brought five years of untold misery on the world. It cannot, however, be termed a war film in the sense commonly attached to that expression. There is very little of actual fighting in it, though such scenes as there are seem Dantesque in their awful horror. M. Gance, who is a poet as well as a film producer, tells this story of a contemporary tragedy quite dispassionately, as though he were reviewing events that have touched us all so nearly purely from some lofty standpoint.\\"J'Accuse\\" opens in the early Summer of 1914. In a long series of beautiful scenes, which take us from Brittany to Provence, from the Gulf of Gascony to the North Sea, we are shown France basking happily in the sun, insouciant and gay as France knows now to be when Nature smiles. Purposely, no doubt, these scenes are not unduly hurried, so that they may give the spectator an impression of absolute security. Then, suddenly, the tocsin sounds. People stare increduously at one another, but when the first moment of stupor has passed every one at once realizes what duty demands. Husbands tear themselves from wives, lovers from mistresses, sons from parents. The fortunes of two of these modern crussders, who both love the same woman, form the theme round which the story of \\"J'Accuse\\" revolves.The ordeal of war has a curious effect on them. One, who has hitherto been cruel and feelingless, almost a brute, to whom the finer instincts of humanity are unknown, is ennobled and purified, so much so that he forgives and makes a friend of the hated rival who, he believes, has robbed him of the only thing he values, his wife's affection. That rival, the only survivor of a battalion which had to be sacrificed, goes mad with all the horrors he has endured. He imagines that his dead comrades have all come back to life, and we see him grinning and gesticulating, advancing at the head of a long procession of the dead who have come back to demand an account of their stewardship from those who had remained at home. It is like some horrible nightmare, yet it has a fascination which keeps the eye riveted on the screen for not far short of three hours.So varied are the scenes and so sustained the interest that the time really appears shorter than that spent in viewing many a film one-third the length. \\"J'Accuse,\\" which was produced and exhibited in France more than a year ago, is a film that puts its author at least on a level with Mr. Griffith, who possibly may have inspired him, though each treats the subject in his own way. It is splendidly acted by a cast which includes M. Joute of the Odeon, M. Desjardine of the Theatre Francals, Mlle. Marise Dauvray and M. Severin-Mars, the last particularly good in the role of the transformed brute.The London Times call the work \\"a fine and brilliantly acted drama of the screen.\\" SCREEN PEOPLE AND PLAYS; IN THE NEWS NET.

It is enough to give freelance warriers over our cultural state nightmares — in wide screen and color. It also clinches the fact that the formidable Italian producing combine of Lux-Ponti-DeLaurentiis has mastered the art of crowding \\"thousands\\" of fur-clad extras in a scene that wasn't intended to mean anything in the first place.As history, \\"Attila,\\" if it is to prevail, will force an extensive rewriting of the encyclopedias. The Hun, played with much grunting, snorting and shouting by Anthony Quinn, takes over the whole of Europe with what looks like little more than a large-sized posse of riders. The two big events before the final battle with the Roman forces outside of Rome are Attila's murder of his pacifist brother (played by Ettore Manni), and Attila's union with Sophia Loren, a Roman princess, for \\"political\\" reasons.According to this version, the sack of Rome didn't take place, not even after the Roman armies were knocked for a loop. The battle, by the way, is somewhat dull considering the fact that most of the film is spent building up to it. Finally, Attila is confronted by an army of white-clad pilgrims at the Tiber and turns his back on further war in an apparent fit of religious conversion.A large, glowing white cross is then superimposed on of plundering, hacking, wal-the haloed scene, making for a rather garish icon with which to wind up such a show loping and whooping. The free-wheeling and pseudo-philosophical dialogue, which is dubbed in English, also makes a passing nod to more recent events when Attila mouths a paraphrase of Hitler.\\"Today, Rome, tomorrow the world,\\" Mr. Quinn yells to his followers.

It is the job of discovering three persons with a rare type of blood that is essential to save the life of a youngster suffering from a rare blood disease. Although it is not a completely original situation in a film, it is cleanly and fairly presented for an interesting and often gripping show.The first donor captured in this crisis is a has-been pugilist, who is found for his service of mercy on the very night of a critical bout in his career. And the deftness with which the sleuthing for him is intercut with a gathering plot of vengeance against him by some hoodlums makes this perhaps the film's best episode. Freddie Mills, a British fighter and ex-light heavyweight champ, is colorful and credible as the boxer, and Sidney James is aptly shady as his tout.The second donor uncovered is a Negro merchant seaman who is loath to provide his service because of an old hurt inflicted upon his sense of race. This episode, simple and dramatic, provides a comment on the quality of human blood that undercuts ancient racial theories. Earl Cameron plays the Negro forcefully.The third donor turns out to be a murderer, living under a pseudonym and disguise. And his ultimate discovery and persuasion make the melodramatic episode in the film. Less credible than the others, this episode is lurid and rapidly paced, and it brings the picture to a fade-out in a fetchingly heroic style.Jack Warner, as the Scotland Yard detective who sparks the round up of the donors","excerpt":"Anthony Steele, as an interested young doctor, and Joy Shelton, as the mother of the child requiring the urgent transfusions, round out the cast, which does well under Lewis Gilbert's direction in this decently diverting film.

Considering the range of Tudor ballets, a statement of this sort might be taken with a grain of salt. Yet it is one of the sharpest clues any choreographer has thrown out about his work. Certainly, it is applicable to ''Pillar of Fire,'' the Tudor landmark that American Ballet Theater will revive on Tuesday.   The title role of Hagar - properly middle-class, sexually repressed and very small-town - has been performed by relatively few dancers in the company's history, and it is now Cynthia Gregory's turn to make her debut in the part that propelled Nora Kaye to fame in 1942.   The dramatic ballerina's dream role, it also one of the most difficult. Technique is one of its hurdles. There are no preparations for turns or lifts, and a dancer's tendency to superimpose acting upon the dancing is at odds with Mr. Tudor's first principle that the dancing is the acting. Emotions are expressed through gestures absorbed into a seamless choreographic flow. But perhaps the most extreme demand upon a dancer is, indeed, to convey the mentality so basic to many Tudor ballets.

To break him in, Anthrax was finishing up a six-date club tour before returning to its usual arena circuit.   With Mr. Bush, Anthrax's music shifts just slightly from the speed-metal that has sold millions of Anthrax albums since the mid-1980's. The band used to touch on slow heavy-metal riffing on the way to doubletime speed-metal blitzes with fast, one-note chanted lyrics. Now the slow passages are longer, and there's often a melody within the crashing, churning, pounding guitars and drums.

If the Arab governments that are our allies believe it is in their interest to join the United States-led coalition, why does that interest cease to exist because Israel determines it has a similar interest?   The presence of anti-Israeli feeling so implacable that it negates national self-interest is frightening in its implications for an Arab-Israeli peace, and that it is accepted as a given, that it remains unexamined, says much about the assumptions under which the news media operate.   One is led to question the solidity and strategic value of a coalition based on the exclusion of America's strongest and most reliable ally, but that includes Syria, whose terrorist credentials equal those of Iraq. The United States has asked Israel to refrain from retaliating for strikes against it, to keep Syria and the other Arab coalition partners from leaving the alliance.
