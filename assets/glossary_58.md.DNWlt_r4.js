He was surrounded by his loving family. For the past 15 months he valiantly battled a rare form of brain cancer. Mr. Rothschild's legacy included a life filled with passion for his family, serving his community, achieving excellence in the workplace, and a desire to travel the world. Steve exemplified the rare combination of high intelligence tempered by gentle humor. He lived every day to its fullest, never wasting a moment. In his limited spare time he ran marathons, baked breads that he delivered to any and all who would accept them, raced cars and took up golf. He devoted his private time to his family, a value taught to him by his parents, the late Alfred and Ilse Rothschild. He was the Managing Partner of the Delaware office of Skadden Arps, which he helped found more than 25 years ago. In addition to being a successful attorney and business leader, Mr. Rothschild was committed to and passionate about serving his community. His community service included, but was not limited to, having served as President of United Way, President of The Kutz Home for the Aged, President of The Delaware Art Museum, and Finance Chair for Senator Carper. As importantly, he was a mentor not only to his sons, but also to young leaders in the broader community. Steven Rothschild touched the lives of those who knew him. His desire to give back to his professional and social communities carried over into the field of education. Mr. Rothschild taught at the law schools of both Georgetown and The University of Pennsylvania as an adjunct professor, and served as a trustee of the University of Delaware. He is survived by his wife and soul mate of 38 years Carol, sons Jeffrey Lee (Debra) and Peter Elliot (Elana), brother Edgar and grandchildren Jonathan Evan and Sydney Eva. A private interment will be held in New York. Shiva will be observed at 7 pm, Tuesday and Wednesday, December 28th and 29th, at his residence.

Died of cancer January 2, 2002, at Scripps Memorial Hospital, La Jolla. Memorial services for Dr. Harden will be held on Monday, January 7, at Mary Star of the Sea Catholic Church, 7727 Girard Ave., La Jolla, at 3:00P.M. Dr. Harden was a native of Rochester, NY. She began her modeling career at age 13 with Eastman Kodak Co. and B. Forman Dept. Store, later earning a scholarship to Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY where she studied fashion design. She was featured on the cover of numerous magazines including Parade, Look and Life. When she married she used her public relations flair to help her husband, Frank E. Harden, build two successful companies, Harden Furniture Co. and The Camden Wire Co. In the 1950s while working for Bausch and Lomb Optical, Ms. Harden was selected by the U.S. Government to participate in a tour of the Soviet Union to educate the USSR on ''what the women of the 50's were really like''. Her next career was on television. Her TV shows took her from Rochester to Miami where she had an early morning TV show, news spots, cooking demonstrations, interviews, exercise shows, and even did the weather. While in Miami Ms. Harden became one of the first woman stockbrokers in the state of Florida, catering to a large and mostly wealthy female client base. Dr. Harden moved to Italy in the 1960s where she lived and concentrated on her artistic talents. After 5 years she returned to the U.S., making her home in La Jolla, CA. She earned her Ph.D in art Therapy in the 1980s. Until 2001, she continued to teach art classes, most recently for the Parks and Recreation Department in Ja Jolla, encouraging new students to paint. Dr. Harden's paintings are in many outstanding private collections throughout the world. Dr. Harden was active in community activities and organizations including the San Diego Opera, The Museum of Modern Art in La Jolla, The Charter 100, ChildHelp USA, American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, and the Food and Wine Club. Dr. Harden is survived by her two daughters, Sheila Harden of La Jolla, CA, and Michelle Sandler of Miami, FL., and three grandchildren, Andrea Harden, Matthew Sandler, and Nathaniel Sandler.

Now one of the world's wealthiest nations, Kuwait has seen its livelihood ruined again, its power and desalting plants destroyed, its oil wells feeding fires that blacken the skies. But few such devastated nations have ever had such gleaming prospects. With an estimated $100 billion in investments abroad, and most of its oil still securely in the ground, Kuwait has the cash and the credit for rebuilding. The Kuwaitis say the allies who fought the hardest will benefit the most","excerpt":"American companies have won about 70 percent of the 200 contracts signed so far. Kuwait has asked the Bechtel Group to manage the reconstruction of its oil industry, potentially a $10 billion task. Caterpillar Inc. is selling diesel engines to provide emergency power; Motorola Inc., portable telephones, and the Raytheon Company, air traffic control gear. Kuwait plans to not only rebuild but also modernize, promoting private enterprise and taking the nation another step beyond reliance on diving for pearls or drilling for oil. Kuwait would just as soon have an economy efficient enough to manage without the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian and Jordanian guest workers, whose political leanings are suspect. The War Payment Plan  Even as American companies gain contracts, the United States is likely to continue paying some costs of its Persian Gulf mission. With rebuilding expenses of $50 billion to $100 billion -- in the same range as the post-World War II Marshall Plan -- Kuwaiti borrowing could squeeze credit around the world. Many analysts suggest that payments from allies will more than cover American military expense. But Hermann F. Eilts, a former Ambassador to Egypt and Saudi Arabia who now directs the Boston University Center for International Relations, said that some nations might have second thoughts. Germany is burdened by reunification costs, he noted, and Japanese legislators are likely to renege on the Government's promises to the United States. \\"When the shooting is over, they find reasons to limit their payments,\\" he said. \\"That means you and I are going to pay.\\" Return of the Oil Jitters  The war ended, but the oil jitters resumed. A barrel of crude, down sharply since the allied assault began Jan. 17, eased back up by $1.47 a barrel to $19.38 last week. Some oil traders voiced fears that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would soon agree to cut back production. And Kuwait is unlikely to resume shipping oil for several months. Iraq, who knows when? But several energy analysts said that the world has already shown it can survive a winter without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil; the longer run worries them much more. Christopher Flavin, an energy specialist at the Worldwatch Institute, said that with worldwide consumption growing and Soviet production falling, the real squeeze could come in the mid-1990's. G.N.P. Hints at Rebound  A revised estimate of the nation's output for the fourth quarter last year provided some evidence that the economy is poised for a rebound in the coming months. The Commerce Department said the the gross national product fell at an annual rate of 2 percent, compared to an initial estimate of 2.1 percent. But inventories were revised down, meaning that manufacturers would have to increase production to meet any stronger demand after the the victory in the Persian Gulf. Economists Turn Upbeat  Economists had a mind last week to emphasize the favorable aspects of statistics that still tell of a recession. Consumer confidence remained at depressing levels last month, according to the Conference Board's survey, but analysts noted that it rose for the first time since September. Purchasing managers, responding to another survey, also remained downcast, but again, not as dismal as the month before. The government's index of leading indicators fell four-tenths of 1 percent for January, the sixth straight decline, but economists tended to say that the end of the war, an expanding money supply and a rising stock market in February virtually guarantee that the next report will be more favorable. \\"You are forming a bottom,\\" said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at First Boston. \\"There is no question about that.\\" She said that growth is likely to resume in mid-year. COMPANIES   Revlon on the Block?  Strip away the makeup, the multibillion-dollar estimates of his worth, and underneath, Ronald O. Perelman is a man facing a possible cash squeeze. Revlon Inc., his giant cosmetics company, is holding sales talks with Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal and Unilever, at prices estimated in the billions. Analysts say that Revlon cannot continue to pay off its heavy debts without selling assets. Selling The Daily News  The survival of the Tribune Company's Daily News now depends on finding a buyer. Talks to settle a strike collapsed last week and The News is trying to negotiate a sale to Robert Maxwell, the British publisher. The Wallenbergs Reach Out  The Wallenbergs of Sweden offered $2.27 billion last week for the portion of Saab-Scania A.B. that they do not already own. The family, which already controls Swedish companies with a market value of between $31 billion and $36 billion, is apparently preparing for Sweden's entry into the European Community and the easing of restrictions on foreign investment. Choosing an Indy Pace Car The Chrysler Corporation's manner of demonstrating patriotic fervor entails as many swerves and scrapes as a 60-mile-an-hour drive though rush-hour traffic. On Monday, Chrysler scrapped plans for its Japanese two-seater, the Dodge Stealth, to be the pace car in the Indianapolis 500. To take its place, the company is rushing out a prototype of the sinuous Dodge Viper. \\"The Viper is a symbol of the can-do attitude and the technical innovation of the American auto industry,\\" a Chrysler executive proclaimed. It also demonstrates the prowess of the Italian auto industry, where Lamborghini, a Chrysler subsidiary, aided in the Viper's development. Or maybe it really is an apt American symbol.  One prototype developed a cracked engine block, and Chrysler only trusts the pace car to manage a single ceremonial lap. If another car is needed during the race, Chrysler will send in the Japanese Stealth. A Looser Accounting Rein?  The four agencies that oversee the nation's banks and savings and loans recommended looser accounting standards on Friday to ease a credit crunch. Critics questioned whether the Government should weaken the rules when so many banks are in trouble. THE ECONOMY   Banks and Insurance  It's not exactly a bailout for banks. Maybe more of a siphoning operation, keeping the banking system afloat with the help of as much as $25 billion in Federal loans. Last Thursday, L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, proposed a $64.4 billion, five-year plan to keep the insurance deposit fund solvent. Annual bank insurance premiums, now 19.5 cents per $100, would increase by at least 3.5 cents, or more depending on how much the fund borrows. Some features of his plan require Congressional approval, while others need only the backing of the F.D.I.C. The insurance fund, at $8.4 billion, stands at its lowest ratio to deposits since it was created during the Depression. Verdict on the Keating Five  The Senate Ethics Committee said their doings reflected \\"poor judgement\\" at the least, but most of the Keating Five are claiming that they have been cleared. In a statement last Wednesday, the committee accused Senator Alan Cranston of misconduct in taking contributions from Charles H. Keating Jr., an executive of a failing savings and loan. Actions by Senators Dennis DeConcini and Donald W. Riegle Jr. appeared improper, the committee said, and Senators John Glenn and John McCain had failings of judgement. \\"I am, of course, relieved that I have been exonerated,\\" said Senator McCain. It remains to be seen whether voters, who have been outraged over the costs of rescuing Mr. Keating's institution and hundreds of others, are equally relieved.
