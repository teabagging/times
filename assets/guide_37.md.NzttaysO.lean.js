Malin Craig, Chief of Cavalry.The film is replete with exciting incidents. It shows twenty-six officers engaged in the difficult riding course. Among the spectacular stunts is a drop of eight feet, followed by a slide of twenty-two feet and ending in the crossing of a stream of considerable width. A jump of four and one-half feet up a perpendicular stone cliff is another difficult hazard.Although there are numerous spills in the picture, all the officers were able to mount and go on with the ride. It is recorded that after the difficult exhibition not one of the twenty-six horses was even lame, but the same could not be said for all of the cavalrymen.The motto of the cavalry, it was explained, is \\"The Outside of a Horse Is the Best Thing for the inside of a Man.\\" General Craig added another:\\"When You Are Going Over a Difficult Jump. You must Throw Your Heart over first.\\"The Chief of Cavalry explained that the film is calculated to show that a cavalryman on horseback can go anywhere that a man on foot can go without using his hands, and some places where the latter cannot go.The film will be shown at the various Army service schools. \\" THE LIFE O' RILEY\\" FILM SHOWS CAVALRY SKILL","excerpt":"Army Picture Presents Thrilling Scenes of Officers' Exploits at Western Fort."},{"year":"1920","title":"\\"PERSHING\\" WINS AIR RACE.","excerpt":"Army Pigeon No. 10,743 First at Camp Vail, N.J., from Capital."},{"year":"1931","title":"2 Army fliers forced down on Jones Beach, L I ESCAPE IN FORCED LANDING","excerpt":"Army Pilot and Aide in Disabled Plane Come Down on Jones Beach."},{"year":"1945","title":"Burke, (Lt) J, and A Noakes pvt plane, Laconia FLIER, GIRL BURN TO DEATH","excerpt":"Army Pilot Crashes in Flames Before His Parents"},{"year":"1943","title":"2 dead, army-civilian planes collision, near Farmingdale KILLED IN MID-AIR CRASH","excerpt":"Army Pilot Dies in Fifth Long Island Plane Mishap in 2 Days"},{"year":"1935","title":"Keenan, J, rescued from East River FLIER RESCUES SWIMMER.","excerpt":"Army Pilot Dives Into East River to Save Man in Distress."},{"year":"1929","title":"Escapes injury in crash of \\"blind flying\\" plane DOOLITTLE CRASHES ON LANDING IN FOG","excerpt":"Army Pilot Escapes Injury as 'Blind' Plane Hits Tree on Kenilworth, N.J., Field.

The Battle of New Britain,\\"which was released to the public here yesterday. The fifty-four-minute picture, filmed by Signal Corps and Air Force camera men, opened at the New York Theatre and will be added to the bills at the Globe, Gotham and Manhattan Theatres today.In as powerful a combat picture as has yet come out of the war, the ordeal of a Pacific beachhead landing is sharply and impressively revealed. The rigor and thoroughness of training, the rugged courage of assault troops under fire and the wretchedness of fighting the jungle are all caught within the camera's constant eye. The photographers who made this startling picture went right in with the troops and filmed a historic record that is as urgent as today's news from Saipan. Crisply edited and given dramatic intensity by a splendid commentary and an eloquent musical score, \\"Attack! The Battle of New Britain\\" is an overwhelming factual war film.Prefaced with a simple dedication to the men who took part in the attacks, this record of the New Britain landings opens with the axiomatic words that \\"the longest march always begins with the first step.\\" And thus it proceeds to show the preparations for the full-scale operations in the staging areas. There are scenes of landing rehearsals, of gunnery practice among Army and Marine troops, of jungle woodcraft taught by dour New Guinea natives and of embarkation for the first assault.The opening attack on New Britain was that at Arawe, designed—as the commentary puts it—as the \\"left feint\\" for the subsequent Cape Gloucester punch. So the picture shows the heavy transports loading for the jab at Arawe, the men aboard the ships bound for the beachheads and the first thrust in the gray light of dawn. \\"There they go!\\" says the commentator, as the landing boats go in, to the deafening roar of gunfire and beneath the streaking tracks of shells hurled at the shore. The camera then goes with the assault troops and searches their tense faces as they crouch behind the steel sides of the landing boats or look gratefully aloft as \\"a sky full of angels\\"— B-25 bombers—roar in to \\"work over\\" the shore.Casualties are seen to drop in the water as the troops indomitably \\"hit the beach,\\" but the men continue to advance, rush into the jungle and dig their hasty foxholes to hang on. The final words of their commander explain the ferocity of their attack: \\"You can only go forward. You can't go backward. There'll be nothing to go back to. Just grab a piece of beach and start shoving!\\" That is what they are seen doing in this film. The attack at Arawe is successful, but at an indicated cost.Then the film goes with the forces trained for the Cape Gloucester attack — shows these men at their Christmas Day devotions, awaiting \\"the hour\\" and loading into their Higgins boats at dawn. Again the B-25's roar over and the shoreline, seen from a plane, becomes a mass of explosions as the low-flying Mitchells drop their bombs.There is a sequence of tremendous tension as the assault troops, now ashore, slip gingerly through the jungle in utter silence, save for the rustle of leaves and the caw of birds. Suddenly there is a crack of a rifle. The advancing men take cover and reply. The jungle re-echoes with clattering gunfire. \\"Contact with the enemy,\\" the commentator laconically says.Later the slim LCI's nudge cautiously into shore to unload the main force and the huge LCT's, with their ramps down, disgorge jeeps and tanks from their maws.The film closes with pitiful glimpses of wounded men and those beyond medical air, with a moving scene of a burial party and with the words, \\"One day of American living, bought and paid for.\\" With that very solemn and arresting reminder, \\"Attack! The Battle of New Britain\\" ends.Advance plans for filming this picture were laid down by Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Lieut. Gen. Brehon B. Somervell, and the direction o fthe entire film project was in the hands of Lieut. Col. Robert Presnell. The picture, as seen was edited from 55,000 feet of exposed negative, including footage contributed by Air Force cameramen. Lieut. Jesse Lasky Jr. wrote the commentary.It is expected that this picture will reach neighborhood theatres in the metropolitan area early next month. More than 400 prints have been prepared for national distribution. The release is through the War Activities Committee of the motion picture industry, with RKO-Radio handling the distribution details.
