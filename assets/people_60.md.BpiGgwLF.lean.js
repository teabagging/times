But Terry Pratchett provides no fancy schools or well-funded training programs for young witches in THE WEE FREE MEN (HarperCollins, $16.99","excerpt":"ages 12 and up), only the power of dreams -- both real and imaginary. In the very first chapter, Tiffany resourcefully uses her sticky little brother, Wentworth, as bait to smack a toothy green sea monster in the face with a frying pan. This minor adventure brings her to the attention of Miss Tick, a full-fledged witch who gives Tiffany some tips about what being a witch is really about: ''Witches don't use magic unless they really have to. It's hard work and difficult to control. . . . A witch pays attention to everything that's going on.'' As Tiffany mulls all this over, she meets a rowdy band of six-inch-tall, kilt-wearing blue men who call themselves the Nac Mac Feegle, or the Wee Free Men, who speak lovingly in their thick Scottish accents about stealing and fighting. Later, when Tiffany must prove herself and rescue Wentworth from the clutches of an evil queen from another dimension, the Wee Free Men and a cranky talking toad with a flair for legal terminology serve as her guides and companions on her quest in the strange land. With its wry wit and acerbic collision of the mystical with the mundane, the latest book in Pratchett's internationally popular Discworld series of fantasy novels, this one specially for young adults, is good solid storytelling done in a style that reads like Celtic mythology fused with the girl power of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' with dialogue by Robert Burns.

MAGIC THINKS BIG, written and illustrated by Elisha Cooper (Greenwillow, $14.99","excerpt":"ages 3 and up), is a book of few words -- fewer than this review -- but many wonderful moments. Magic stays perfectly still and thinks with pleasure about the things he might do. He could ask for more food. He could sleep a little. Wait, he could chase some loons. No -- he assigns that job to a dog. He then imagines diving into the lake and wrangling a salmon. It will be such a big salmon that he'll need a moose to help him carry it, and some bears to help him eat it. He and the bears will eat the salmon with blueberry pie.

Morozumi's spare text and her luscious pictures will move just about any preschooler from giggles to sadness to a measure of understanding about how good friends are always a part of us. Adults may get teary-eyed. When a gorilla comes to live with the zookeeper's family, the zookeeper's son is at first scared of the huge creature who sleeps on his bottom bunk. But the gorilla is nice, and soon the boy has a new friend. Together boy and gorilla go to the park, read books and dream in the trees. The gorilla even goes to the boy's birthday party, where he is the largest guest. Then the cold weather comes, and it is time for the gorilla to go back to Africa. The boy cries when he says goodbye. He stays sad until a letter comes one day with a picture of the gorilla in the African jungle. The gorilla has a baby on his back! He looks happy, and so the boy is happy too. ''I still remember him,'' the boy says on the last page, gazing out his window, looking past the gorilla's photograph on the sill. Thumbtacked to the wall is a picture the boy has drawn of himself and his friend, holding hands. Everyone will adore the illustrations; the best is of the gorilla sitting at the boy's birthday table alongside nonchalant little girls in party dresses.

On a visit to his grandmother, where he has a whale of a time, paddling around in Grannys boat and tossing jam sandwiches to the snippy-snappy sea monsters, he begins to shrink. Wisely, his grandmother diagnoses the problem as an acute case of homesickness and sends him on his way. Despite his diminutive stature, brave Antonio secures a job swabbing the decks of a ship, serving as the lookout on a train and taming a huge wild horse, his small, determined song carrying him ever closer to the only place he wants to be: Im on the way home! . . . For I want to be home with my mother! By the time Antonio reaches his destination, he is alarmingly tiny but -- no surprise! -- the combination of his mothers hugs and heaping portions of her home cooking quickly restores him to his normal size. In a charming reversal of Margaret Wise Browns classic tale The Runaway Bunny, Doyle, an Irish author now living in Wales, writes winningly of homesickness and its only known cure: Mom and the comforts of home. Cneuts bold, idiosyncratic pictures, full of competing textures and colors, present a fabulous world gone slightly askew (all of the illustrations slant on the page), while Antonios amply proportioned mother is a reassuring study in mother love with her heart-shaped retro hairdo and pink housedress printed with hearts. Younger children especially will identify with this picaresque tale, where even a visit to a beloved grandparent can seem a world away from the only place they really want to be: HOME!

The same can be said of how parents regard their kids, and Quentin Blake, the masterly British illustrator, does just that in ZAGAZOO (Orchard, $15.95","excerpt":"ages 5 and up), his wonderfully wry sketch of what happens when a twosome becomes a threesome.    To explain the plot of this nimble-witted picture book is to explain life itself, but here goes: George and Bella, happily immersed in themselves, receive a package. In it is a cute little bundle labeled Zagazoo, and George and Bella have a lot of fun tossing it around. Trouble soon arrives in paradise, however, and the smiley Zagazoo suddenly turns into a baby vulture. To George and Bella's dismay, more transmutations follow -- elephant, wart hog, dragon, bat, hairy creature -- driving the poor couple to distraction and gray hair. Then one morning, ever ruing the day they opened the package, George and Bella discover that their all-in-one menagerie has become . . . a mannerly young man, again a delight to have in the house, though much too big to toss around. Soon this polite lad meets Mirabelle, and the two of them have so much fun fixing motorcycles and eating fruit salad together that they decide to make their attachment permanent.

''Gesundheit''? The real tanuki is a small Japanese mammal, something between a badger and a raccoon. Traditionally thought to be able to assume human form, it is reportedly fond of practical jokes and trouble-making. The tanuki in Tim Myers's story TANUKI'S GIFT: A Japanese Tale (Marshall Cavendish, $16.95","excerpt":"ages 5 to 8), illustrated by R. G. Roth, is cut from a different cloth. One icy night, it calls at the hut of a Buddhist priest, begging shelter. Disregarding the creature's reputation for mischief, the lonely priest offers his hospitality. For years they winter together. Eventually, the tanuki asks what it can do in recompense, and the priest reluctantly admits that three gold coins would buy prayers for his soul to enter Paradise. The tanuki takes its leave. The priest waits and waits, but by the time the tanuki returns, he no longer wants the gold, having learned instead a valuable lesson about friendship. The tale is adroitly told, but the real highlights are Richard Roth's mixed-media collages, a playground of cross-cultural references and Japanese influences from ink painting to paper decoration. The rounded priest in rainbow robes contrasts appealingly with the lithe, scratchy tanuki in black and white. A complement of objects both familiar and mysterious adorns the well-textured settings, and a great sense of whimsy pervades all: watch the tanuki juggle, capering like a river otter; see the priest imagine himself ascending to heaven, wearing a halo and carried by an umbrella, like Mary Poppins. Myers, whose two previous books are set in Japan and Hawaii, notes that he's more interested in telling a story than in elaborating a cultural tradition, and this story is more about universal values of friendship than about either Buddhism or the tanuki. More important, it is lovely and entertaining, and the tanuki, rarely known for repaying generosity in kind, c 'Tanuki's Gift' and Other Children's Book Review"},{"year":"2004","title":"Paul Fleischmans story THE ANIMAL HEDGE (Candlewick, $16.99","excerpt":"ages 5 to 9) is as simple as a folk song. Its illustrator, the Russian-born Bagram Ibatoulline, has followed the style of American folk painters of the 18th and early 19th centuries, and the result is as haunting as a loved melody. As the book opens, a farmer lives with his three sons in a peaceable kingdom of cows and chickens, pigs and sheep. His heart glowed like a hot wood stove with the love of animals; he and his boys sang as they worked. This idyll appears in ovals of color, set in sepia frames adorned with folk motifs, like a songbook or the pages of a family album. Then a drought comes. The pictures now glow with terrible heat, the animals ribs show, and a heartbreaking little pig peers hopelessly at the bottom of a dry and empty wooden basin. The farmer is desolated; by the time rain and new growth return to the land, he has lost almost everything; the animals are gone, and the farmer has no money to buy more. He and his sons live in a tiny cottage, sharpening tools for a living. One day, preparing to trim his rough hedge, the farmer seems to discern the shapes of his vanished animals in his hedge and clips it to bring out their forms. Soon he is surrounded by green leafy cows, goats and sheep. The sweet and solemn story circles around until the farmer has back what was lost, the same but changed.

An excellent biography by Yona Zeldis McDonough, PEACEFUL PROTEST: The Life of Nelson Mandela (Walker, $16.95","excerpt":"ages 6 to 10), highlights the turning points that made such a result possible. As a little boy, Mandela watched his family lose their cattle and their land because his father, a Thembu chief, would not recognize British authority, yet he sent his son to a British-style school, where he exchanged his birth name, Buti, for Nelson. At the ritual marking his passage into manhood, he heard a speech that determined the course of his life. The ''promise of manhood would remain unfilled,'' McDonough writes, ''because all black South Africans were a conquered people -- slaves in their own land, denied their freedoms and their rights.'' Mandela pursued two vocations: lawyer and political activist. He organized protest marches, boycotts and strikes and was jailed many times for fighting apartheid. The last time, in 1963, he was tried for sabotage and planning the violent overthrow of the government, and sentenced to life in prison. For the next 27 years he lived in a small cell on Robben Island, where he was allowed one visitor and one letter every six months. .

For Ages 6 to 9: A Variety of Stories and Tales","excerpt":"Ages 6 to 9: Stories and Tales"},{"year":"2003","title":"Generations of children have taken the Berenstain Bears of Jan and Stan Berenstain into their hearts. Many a 4-year-old has found comfort in the archetypal characters: the bumbling father, the intelligent, all-knowing mother, the universal brother and sister. In Bear Country, youngsters safely approach common issues: the world of family (''The Berenstain Bears' New Baby'') and friendship (their ''No Girls Allowed''), fears (their ''Afraid of the Dark'') and anxieties (their ''Go to School''). The Berenstains' success is measured by over 260 million copies of hundreds of titles sold. DOWN A SUNNY DIRT ROAD: An Autobiography (Random House, $20","excerpt":"ages 8 and up) is a dual memoir by the artists, both born in Philadelphia in 1923. It is told in alternating chapters, using a heavily illustrated procedure much like that of another narrative cartoonist in ''Bill Peet: An Autobiography.'' The Berenstains met at art school in 1941, but soon Stan was a medical artist in the Army, and Jan was taking classes while working as an aircraft riveter. The authors effectively mix narrative cartoons, photographs and their early schoolwork in this part of their story. Their marriage and commercial success as magazine illustrators are moderately interesting, but the real core of their autobiography describes the birth of their first children's book. They were fans of Dr. Seuss, and felt a similar presentation would work with their cartooning style, sense of humor and family adventures. The Berenstains traveled from Philadelphia to New York to meet with their editor for the Random House ''Beginner Books'' series, Theodor Geisel (also known as Dr. Seuss). Geisel used brutally blunt terms to describe the editorial changes he wanted. The Berenstains were crushed, but struggled to understand. The collaboration that transformed ''Freddy Bear's Spanking'' into ''The Big Honey Hunt,'' published in 1962 and still in print, is a primer in how picture books can be made to work.

Lucy Rose has a lot to figure out: how to find a friend; how to deal with her nemesis, the boy she thinks of as Melonhead; and how to persuade her teacher, Mr. Welsh, to let her take home the class guinea pig during vacation.

Even though the Federal Aviation Administration is facing a difficult stretch, until new systems are designed, tested and installed it is doing something surprising with maintenance: cutting back.
