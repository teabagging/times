Some of Mr. Eagle's images that probably appeared fresh and poetic at the time -- particularly his many shots of withered old Jewish men in prayer -- have now become cliched. More interesting are his photographs of men gathered in Union Square to argue about world events, of the dining room of a hall for the elderly, and of several clean-cut boys learning the prayers and traditions of the synagogue. Mr. Eagle's photographs do not carry the weight of such ominous images as those taken by Roman Vishniac of impoverished Eastern European Jews shortly before the Holocaust.

Eye-filling is the word for Signorina Loren and the itinerary, which is as arresting as the Aegean's blue waters and classic, ancient ruins. The story of this quest for the priceless gold and bronze statue of the title is a good deal less than classic, and makes an observer doubly grateful for the scenery and Signorina Loren.The scenarists, to put it bluntly, have come up with a pleasant but obviously lightweight adventure that has been slightly seasoned with \\"chase\\" melodrama and lukewarm romance.The titular \\"Boy,\\" which adorns the bow of a vessel that has lain sunken off the island of Hydra for 1,900 years, is accidentally discovered by Signorina Loren, a volatile sponge diver, and Jorge Mistral, her belligerent Albanian boy friend. The idea is to sell this art treasure, a practice officially frowned upon by the Greek Government. Alan Ladd, a dedicated archaeologist, agrees to help Signorina Loren, but Clifton Webb, a rich, suave esthete, who is equally dedicated to snagging the statue for himself, offers her lots of drachmas.Although the poor, rustic Signorina Loren cannot be blamed for longing for riches, a yearning that forces her to plot against Mr. Ladd, the antiquities lover, it is a losing battle she wages. The outcome of this benign struggle is clear almost from the start. But director Jean Negulesco, who also was responsible for \\"Three Coins,\\" and the rest of his troupe, did not waste color film. The trip paid off in fine, unusual, exotic and beautiful footage for this first American company to shoot in Greece.Highly recommended are the white houses of the island of Hydra, where most of the film was shot, rising in terraces against the cobalt, curving bay","excerpt":"the ancient amphitheatre at Epidaurus with its amazing acoustics; the monastery at Meteora, high on a crag and accessible only via a hand-raised, primitive \\"elevator.\\"And, of course, there are the Parthenon on Athens' column-strewn Acropolis, the sweeping, blue vistas of the Aegean and such historic isles as Delos, Rhodes and Mykinos. Authentic color also is added to two scenes in which Signorina Loren and a Greek troupe do several folk dances to wailing, native tunes.The abundantly endowed Signorina Loren, who is as decorative as any classic statue is given ample opportunity to be photographed against island rocks and in the fish and frond-filled green murky depths of the sea. Wet or dry, she makes a pretty picture and, on occasion, delivers herself of some fiery emotion to prove that she is also willing and able to act.Mr. Ladd is merely a moody scientist, who doesn't give the impression that he really is her type. Mr. Mistral, who does appear to be her type, apparently can use nothing but his muscles. Piero Giagnoni is cute as Signorina Loren's kid brother, and the urbane Mr. Webb, who tries in a restrained, superior fashion to be cute, is not.There is no point in quibbling, however. Signorina Loren and the islands make the trip worth while.Heading the ice and stage show at the Roxy are Louis (Satchmo) Armstrong and his All Stars. Included on the bill are the Roxyettes, performing both dancing and skating routines; Jerry Vale, vocalist, and Nicky Powers and Leslie Sang, an adagio team.BOY ON A DOLPHIN, screen play by Ivan Moffat and Dwight Taylor, from the novel by David Divine; directed by Jean Negulesco; produced by Samuel G.

What would it take to quiet a packed, demonstrative theatre smack on the heels of a bombastic rock 'n' roll stage revue? The answer yesterday at Loew's State was the program's obvious postscript—a surprisingly decent little Western titled \\"Fury at Showdown.\\"John Derek, the small cast's only \\"name,\\" is starred in this United Artist's release, a Robert Goldstein presentation. After about ten minutes, it becomes obvious that some leathery citizens of a place called Showdown Creek are sounding and behaving like real people.Why? Because this unpretentious, low-budget entry is leanly written, tersely acted and, above all, straightforward. Adapted by Jason James from a novel by Lucas Todd, the plot tells how a hotheaded young trigger expert, who returns home mislabeled a killer, bucks community hostility and the revengeful conniving of an accidental victim's brother.It is nice indeed to watch the unapologetic way in which the camera clings to the dusty main street where most of the action unfolds. Under Gerd Oswald's sure direction, this tightly authentic atmosphere, the good, blunt dialogue and some discreetly inserted music do much to project the urgency of Mr. Derek's plight—that of a young man at his life's crossroads.Add to this a strictly sideline romance, one humdinger of a fistfight and a climax centering on the foreclosure of a bank note, no less. Best of all, perhaps, from a low budget come some interesting suggestions about courage, self-deception and trial by evidence.Mr. Derek fits his part to a T. Nick Adams is quietly effective as his loyal brother, and so is Carolyn Craig, as the hero's old flame. As the culprit, Gage Clarke is a convincing, wide-eyed sadist. And Robert E. Griffin and Sydney Smith are fine as two independent thinkers. With all due respect to Jocko and His Rock 'n' Roll Revue and all the stage commotion, one viewer votes for the cowboys.

GriffinTHE only thing to do with a film like \\"African Manhunt,\\" which stumbled into view at the Forty-sixth Street Embassy yesterday, is to wave it on its way as quickly as possible. This melodrama about two guys and a girl who are escorting a criminal \\"to the coast\\" seems shoddier than torn mosquito netting, even when compared with the spate of poor films about Africa that have been palmed off as first-run features lately.The narrative scenes, filmed in some studio with a tent and a grass hut for sets, seldom match the library footage of semi-nude Africans and animals goring each other. The writing, the acting, the direction and everything else about the film is equally makeshift. It is another African safari without credentials, but let it pass. That's the law of the jungle.Makeshift SafariAFRICAN MANHUNT, original story and screen play by Arthur Hoerl; directed by Seymour Friedman; produced by Jerry Thomas; presented by Republic.

The new Soviet jazz comedy at the Cameo, in its uniquely Russian blend of syncopated music and straightforward slapstick, is no more politically minded than a Laurel and Hardy picture. Written and directed by the hitherto orthodox Gregory Alexandrov, who assisted Eisenstein on \\"Potemkin,\\" it is a loud and brawling carnival, unashamed in its imitation of the bourgeois Hollywood technique, and curiously attractive even when it is being as subtle as a side of beef.\\"Moscow Laughs\\" has its decided faults, quite apart from the antiquity of a major proportion of its humor. The lighting of the interiors is wretched, the recording is frequently inferior, and the film is at least twenty minutes too long for complete comfort. Yet the fact of the matter is that the film bursts with vitality and is sometimes uproariously side-splitting.If Mack Sennett could see how many of his pre-war nifties have been borrowed for the occasion he would have difficulty in convincing himself that the year is 1935. There is the comic who, upon viewing a plaster Venus de Milo, inquires how the lady manages to scratch herself. There is the comedienne who slaps her partner vigorously across the face on the pretext that a mosquito has landed on his nose. There is the invasion of a dignified house party by a herd of farm animals, occasioning such comic inventions as the attachment of a rope to the guest's trousers, the other end being tied to an enraged bull","excerpt":"the animals drinking out of the punch bowl and thereupon indulging in a drunken spree, the lady who climbs innocently into a bed which is al ready occupied by a cow, and the goat which gets tangled up in a tiger's skin, causing grave consternation among the guests.Then, in the knockabout musical burlesque which is the final and most consistently amusing section of the picture, there is a jazz orchestra which might give our local Frank and Milt Britton boys a few ideas on mass slaughter. Apparently inspired by the Brittons, this Muscovite outfit goes in for a joyous breaking of instruments and skulls with an enthusiasm which ought to correct any false impressions concerning the solemnity of the Bolsheviki.The story of \\"Moscow Laughs\\" is about as unimportant as the critical stew into which it is sure to plunge the dialectical materialists on the Left. You ought to be told, though, that it concerns a rustic fellow who is always being mistaken for a celebrated musician and who finally arrives on a Moscow concert stage, to the vast detriment of Beethoven and Liszt. According to the program, the excellent theme song of \\"Moscow Laughs\\" is singing: \\"Hurrah for Life! Hurray for Happiness and Love!\\" Lubov Orlova, a handsome and expert comedienne, excels among the performers. Relating \\"Moscow Laughs\\" to the class struggle ought to become a favorite indoor sport for the local comrades. For the rest of us it is an engaging slapstick, even if the film sometimes seems to be more of a credit to Hollywood than to Moscow.

The album (Paisley Park/Warner Brothers 45037; CD and cassette) -- whose title is an unpronounceable amalgam, concocted by Prince, of the male and female symbols -- weaves a funky fairy tale about sexual and musical conquest, dipping into the Bible and the hipster dictionary for lyrical inspiration.  \\"In a word or 2 -- it's u I wanna do/ No, not cha body yo mind u fool,\\" he declares in typical Prince slang in the Parliament-Funkadelic-influenced flagship number, \\"Sexy MF.\\" With these words, the album draws the listener into a musical seduction in which sex, spirituality and music converge as the route to salvation.

She was, of course, thinking of the actions of governments, but the point applies to mere moviemakers, too. From James Bond to Dirty Harry, from ''Straw Dogs'' to ''Scarface,'' there has been unsettling progress over the past few decades in the efficiency of the delivery of violence, more bangs for more bucks. Maybe it's time for an arms freeze in the directors guild.    How much violence is too much? Moral philosophers faced with the question regarding war have spoken of a ''principle of proportion'' - that is, the good to be achieved or the evil prevented by a resort to violence should be greater than the values it destroys.   Applying that sort of measure to the movies, one might say that violence is justified when no more of it is used than is needed to realize a work of art or entertainment - which gets us about as far as the philosophers have gotten in defining a ''just war.''

Presumably, this is intended. We are meant to see the Soviet Union and its citizens the way we would if we were walking around Moscow, say, or lolling about in Sochi on the Black Sea. At the same time, ''Inside Russia,'' on Channel 5 at 9 tonight, has a deeper purpose: It wants to measure Soviet freedom.

There have been phone calls and letters galore, extolling the fun and providing evidence of a couple of things. First, people love minutiae. And, second, I am every bit as fumble-brained as I thought. But permit me a small reprise.   The Feb. 17 column on auto upmanship talked about the time in the 50's when a bunch of us would huddle over coffee at the Crystal Lunch in Allentown, Pa., and play a game, the object of which was stump-your-buddy. When one of the others answered correctly or proved you wrong, he got to ask a question of his own, and so on.   The column offered 20 questions and answers, and Answer No. 3 was the one that got me into trouble. Which import, I asked, first decided to build an American assembly plant and where was it? The answer, I said with some smugness, was Rolls-Royce, which began to assemble cars in Springfield, Mass., in 1921.   Aha! said the world.    Gotcha!    said the world.   Tony Ciminera was the first in line, or    on    the line, actually. Ciminera and I once were co-drivers in a race at Lime Rock, Conn., so he was kindly on the phone, although there was a shuushhh of derisiveness in the wires, no doubt a result of crossed conversations. But as he said it, I knew he was right.   No, dummy,    not    Rolls-Royce. The first company to assemble automobiles here was Mercedes- Benz. The year was 1905, and the place was Long Island City, N.Y.   That was also pointed out by J. Bruce McWilliams of New York, who wrote that the car was produced by the Daimler Manufacturing Co., \\"which had close ties with the German company but was owned by William Steinway, the piano manufacturer and first Mercedes importer.\\"   \\"If memory serves me correctly,\\" McWilliams wrote, \\"there was a plaque on the building in Long Island City, just as there is on the building in Springfield where the Rolls was built.\\"   Then there was the letter from Arthur Einstein of New York, who, like some others, mistakenly thought I was being devious by asking which foreign manufacturer was the first to \\"build\\" an American plant.    \\"I believe the Springfield Rolls was assembled in a plant that already existed and had been the plant of one of the company's coachbuilders,\\" he wrote. \\"More to the point, I am almost certain that around 1903 the Mercedes was shipped knocked down to Astoria, Queens, and assembled there.\\"   The definitive answer came, of course, from Mercedes in the person of its spokesman, John Chuhran. \\"I thought you might be interested to learn that one of your answers was wrong,\\" he wrote.    Indeed.    \\"In 1905,\\" Chuhran added, \\"the American Mercedes was built in Long Island City under license from the Daimler Motor Co. The principal behind the venture was William Steinway, the famous piano builder. Less than 100 examples were built from January 1905 until a fire destroyed the factory on Feb. 13, 1907. The only known surviving example is on display in the lobby of our corporate headquarters in Montvale, N.J.\\"   So. But Chuhran also enclosed a couple of fascinating pieces of literature, and this seems like a good time to dust off a bit more of that automotive lore. There is, for instance, the Mercedes name, which had nothing to do with Gottlieb Daimler or Karl Benz, who never met but whose companies merged in 1926 to form Daimler-Benz AG.    The name was applied by Emil Jellinek, an Austrian businessman and consul-general, who entered a 23-horsepower Daimler in an 1899 race in Nice and used the name of his daughter Mercedes as a pseudonym. Jellinek later ordered 36 of the cars, planning to sell them, and was promised that the cars would be named for the apple of his eye.   The Mercedes designation proved so successful that it was decided to use it on all Daimler cars, and it was registered as a trade name in 1902. That done, Gottlieb Daimler's two sons set about finding a trademark.    According to the story, their late father had once sent a postcard to his wife with a star sketched above their house, indicating that the star would one day appear to mark the ascendancy of his work. The star's three points also seemed to symbolize transportation by land, sea and air, and it was registered in June 1909.    The American Mercedes came into being when Steinway worked a deal to build the cars here, avoiding the import tariff in order to sell them more cheaply. And, in light of today's market, it is interesting that the original brochure opens by musing this way: \\"Whether or not domestic automobiles will some day be built which will compare favorably with their foreign cousins is a question which the future must decide.\\"    A lot of the letters pointed to similar elements of Mercedes history, and some included trivia quizzes of their own. One, from John Sharp of Squantum, Mass., offered 50 tricky definitions and segmented blanks for the answers. Sharp said he penned the puzzle for friends while recuperating from surgery.   And then there was the letter from Fritz Blum of the Bronx. Having pointed out the Rolls-Royce blunder, he quibbled with my answer to Question 20, in which I said that Buick's famous portholes had no function other than styling.   \\"In 1949 and 1950,\\" Blum wrote, \\"these portholes were connected to a duct through which hot air was drawn out of the engine compartment. This was particularly helpful, as the Buick straight-8 had a tendency to overheat. Only in 1951 did the portholes become nonfunctional.\\"   This time I cheated and called Buick, and it turns out we are both wrong.    The holes in Buick fenders were called Venti- Ports, and they did start as heat outlets. They were the brainchild of Ned Nickles, then the head of Buick styling, and early cars had ducts from the engine compartment. But the hoses were pulled off only months after their introduction in 1949, and the portholes were forever sealed.   In any case, the phone call from Ciminera was the first to shoot me down.

Instead, one was overcome by the feeling that, in one form or another, we had been on these journeys before.

The fourth, ''Requiem for a Heavyweight,'' was new to the stage, but the story was familiar from its television and film incarnations. Furthermore, in all but ''Anatol,'' there were aspects - in the dramaturgy, subject matter or performance styles - that were decidedly dej a vu. Each of the four was burdened by an overloaded bank of memory.

Born in 1916, he was younger than most other members of that historic group, and he lived longer than most of them, producing work of great quality and ambition until the end. Yet his career was the least familiar to the public. In an age when artists became mythic personalities in the media, he remained a private person -- a joy and an inspiration to those who knew him but an essentially unknown figure as far as the engines of art-world publicity were concerned.\\n\\nHe was an artist I greatly admired, and I knew him as a dear friend for many years. Richard shared many of the hopes and aspirations of his contemporaries in the New York School, especially their fervent belief in the efficacy of abstraction as a means of artistic expression. He came to that belief early -- his first exhibition, at the old Artists' Gallery, took place in 1941 -- and at a time when it enjoyed little popularity or support. Social realism, populist regionalism and the cornball mural painting of the Federal Art Project were still the standard by which contemporary art was judged in the press and sanctioned by the few institutions that took an interest in it. In none of that did Richard ever take the least interest.

The marketing orders enable growers to set limits for the output of 11 fruit, vegetable and nut crops on a weekly and a seasonal basis and make available to them the power of the Federal Government to prosecute growers who sell more than their pro-rated allotment under the system.

The 80-year old architect feared the development of 50 single-family houses would occupy the rest of his career, so he limited his involvement. He did design six buildings - one of them, a community center - but only three were built; the core of the exhibition is the Wrightdrawings.

It would make equal sense for the modern Irish to lay claim to France because it was inhabited by the Celtic Gauls before the Roman and Frankish (Germanic) conquests.   However, the ancient Macedonians were not Greeks and did not speak a Greek dialect, though they ultimately conquered Greece and, under Alexander the Great, carried Greek language and civilization to the entire eastern Mediterranean. The Macedonian language is recorded only in scanty glossary items compiled by the fifth-century Greek grammarian Hesychius. All that can be said about it with certainty is that it was Indo-European. It had some features that suggest close kinship with Greek and others that seem to link it to Illyrian, the ancestor of modern Albanian.

A show of photographs by this indefatigable artist opens on Saturday at the Voltaire Gallery in New Milford, and runs through Feb. 28. The show covers the period from 1960 to 1990, beginning shortly after the death of her husband in New York, and continuing through the past 15 years, when she has been a Connecticut resident.    Working in color and experimenting constantly with new printing and finishing techniques, Ms. Walsh chooses subjects that range from landscapes to individual flowers, children to animals.     She learned her craft during the Depression, through a free course offered by the Works Progress Administration, which she attended while raising two daughters and running a household. Later, she returned the favor by photographing an enormous body of work done by W.P.A. artists in post offices, town halls and other public buildings.    Back in 1922, she graduated with honors from New York University as one of 2 women out of 200 students majoring in corporate finance. During World War II, she spent six years as chief officer of the Red Cross Motor Corps in Queens.    The gallery is on Route 7 at Route 37, three miles north of New Milford. Viewing hours are from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Monday through Saturday. Phone 354-4200 for more information.

The Abakharov high-wire troupe and Moiseyev spring-pole acrobatic ensemble cast Newton's gravitational apple out the window. And through it all, a succession of clowns and educated bears relieve the tension with their antics.    Performances are at 7:30 P.M. Wednesday through Saturday, plus daytime shows at 10:30 A.M. on Friday, 11 A.M. and 3:30 P.M. on Saturday, and 1 and 5 P.M. on Sunday. Tickets are $14, $17 and $25, with discounts available for children and the elderly. Opening-night tickets are half price.    The Coliseum is at 275 South Orange Street, off Exit 47 of Interstate 95 or Exit 1 of Interstate 91. For reservations call the box office, 772-4330.

Famine and the Red Army have been at work.   Famine has always stalked Russia. Czar Alexander II was assassinated in 1881 by anarchists who had nothing to lose anymore. Famine and disease were killing off the recently freed \\"mujiks,\\" or farm serfs. When widespread death is inevitable, violent revenge visits the leadership that enforces the starvation.   In 1905, the tragic Father Gapon organized an unarmed march for bread in Petrograd. Peaceful Russian marchers were cut down at the Winter Palace by Cossack Guards. Czar Alexander III faced a spontaneous revolt for this \\"bloody Sunday.\\" He wisely gave the people bread and a weak Duma (parliament), but most important, he kept the army on his side. This turmoil gave us the word \\"Soviet,\\" and the emergence of Leon Bronstein (Trotsky) in the few heady days of the Petrograd Soviet.   In 1917, after Czar Nicholas II had directly caused millions of Russian Army casualties, after famine had taken terrible hold, after the First World War had turned Europe's godly monarchies upside down, the army moved against the Czar.   The Socialists didn't have the power to depose the Czar","excerpt":"the army did. Large elements of the army would not fire on Russians in Petrograd. Unlike 1905, the Czar fell. The Socialist Government was swept aside by the Bolsheviks under force of arms -- again, elements of the army.   Lenin accepted terror. Stalin perfected it. Stalin used force to gut any organization that might move against him, including the army and the Cheka (secret police), predecessor to the K.G.B. Since Stalin, the question of control has been the position of the army, as in the days of the czars. The army has rebuilt. Its senior officers are anti-Stalinist Russians. All the general secretaries from Nikita S. Khrushchev to Mikhail S. Gorbachev have had to grapple with the fundamental question: would the ethnic Russian garrisons of Leningrad and Moscow fire on ethnic Russian civilians in time of starvation?    This year, for the first time, we hear rumors of urban famine. The shops have gone bare in Moscow. Army commissaries, shops for the families of officers, are also bare. The Russian winter extends to April. What will happen if there is no food or heat in Moscow during March? President Gorbachev knows. The fractured, post-Stalin Politburo has dealt with the concept but never the actual question before. If the mob comes for the Politburo, where will the Red Army stand?    It will not fire on the crowd. It will probably join it, not as the leader of the next revolution, but as the determining force of a new regime. The Politburo has acted to buy time in the face of the inevitable. It's broke. The system is collapsing. There is no Stalin to pay for Moscow bread with Ukrainian lives.   Helsinki didn't change Russia. The prospect of famine did. President Gorbachev was an active-duty Communist until the cards were clearly laid out.    Iraq is an imminent problem, but the larger problem is what to do with the Soviet Union when the next revolution takes charge. Unlike Trotsky's Red Army in 1918, today's Russian Navy has a sub that can fire cruise missiles on station off New York and Washington. By April, new Russian masters might inherit the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons on earth. If famine comes, Mikhail Gorbachev will be torn from power. Is there a Stalin in the wings?   Do we feed them? Do we act now, or do we wait for their next revolution? Watch the Russian Army garrisons of the Greater Russian cities. Imagine Romania with 4,000 nuclear weapons! It's coming in the spring.   The Helsinki Accords were irrelevant. Crafty politicians tried to certify Russian control over populations that, like any brave people with nothing left to lose, would stand and fight. The Russian Army, neither \\"imperial\\" nor \\"red,\\" will nullify Helsinki, the Communist Manifesto and the infamous Yalta accords with force, soon. PATRICK G. FINEGAN JR.

The ground should slope away from the house on all sides so that in a heavy rain, water tends to run away from the foundation walls, not collect in pools next to them. If water seeps down next to the basement walls, it increases the underground water pressure, helping to force the water in through tiny cracks or porous sections, or to force it in through the joints where walls and floor meet on the inside.   During a rainstorm, a lot of this water comes from the roof, which acts like a huge collector for all the water that falls on it. If allowed to run off indiscriminately, this water will run down next to the house walls and saturate the ground outside the basement - increasing the likelihood that some of it will find its way inside.

Stieglitz, already famed as a photographer and a fervent supporter of modern artists, thinks otherwise.

The artist's absorbing commentary (recorded during interviews with Lawrence Rinder, curator for 20th-century art at the University Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive at the University of California, Berkeley, who also contributes an excellent introduction) reveals the emotional and philosophical roots of her imagery.

Where anthologies of recent work from other European nations at the Guggenheim and elsewhere have enjoyed at most a success of politeness, this one includes at least two artists - Sandro Chia and Enzo Cucchi - for whom dealers and collectors all over the world are standing in line. Others in the show may well be in the same position before long. Italian art is in, that is to say, in a way that has not happened for many, many years.   For that matter it has been difficult ever since the death of Giandomenico Tiepolo in 1804 for an Italian painter to make a lasting international name for himself. There were good Italian painters in the 19th century, but no one is going to claim that Fattori and Segantini were prized by foreigners as the personification of Italy in the way that was true of Verdi in the opera house and of Manzoni in literature.   Before World War I the Italian Futurists were very hot on the international scene - so much so in fact that they seemed to scorch the very air as they passed. But there was in many of their beliefs a proto-Fascist element that has not worn well. We really don't want to think of Italy in terms of people who thought that it was in making war that man found his greatest fulfillment.

Whether this generous display of broken dishes and vases will be considered as any definite furtherance in the progress of the screen is a debatable point, but the argument may be put forth that there is more effect in shattering a supposedly costly vase than in the tossing of the humble pie.Clarance Badger, director of this active piece of work, has carefully avoided any criticism of the accuracy of the aim of the different experts in this line, for all he asks them to do is to throw anywhere what they pick up: but one of the players when ??? eight feet from a door manages to hit it every time. Even Chester Conklin, who seems to refrain from this fractious conduct so long as he can, finally grabs a would-??? ??? and hurls it against the wall with most successful results. Supposing they had several rehearsals of these scenes the amount of pottery and crockery broken must have been highly satisfactory. It may have been fun while making the picture, but on the screen, with the lack of sound, it is problematical whether the majority of spectators appreciate the wit of such performances. At the same time there is the probability such conduct may stir the very soul of a kitchen-maid, who experiences woe when she accidentally breaks a single dish or a glass. Think how she would envy Bebe Daniels in the orgy of plate-smashing the actress gives in one brief scene of this production!The story of this film, which is based on the play of the same name, is swamped by the artistic chinaware activities. Ginette is a waitress in a Parisian restaurant, and the mere idea of trying to embrace her results disastrously for at least one young man. She is discharged by Pierre, the proprietor of the place, on each occasion she loses her temper, but the next day she returns as usual to wait upon the customers. As the background is Hollywood's idea of Montmarte, there is the inevitable impecunious artist.Mr. Conklin, as Maraval, secretary to a M. Lambert, at first refuses to touch a glass of wine, but a second later, to steady his nerves, he attacks the decanter with avidity. He subsequently finds himself shut in a wine closet, where he manages to add to the tone in this feature by his remarkable discovery that when bottles fall to the ground they break.Miss Daniels, like the story, is lost in a sea of shattered bottles and ornaments. Mr. Conklin looks as if he had returned to the Mack Sennett fold in a vehicle which is more boisterous than funny.Jesse Crawford gives an excellent demonstration in the surrounding program of effects that can be obtained from the Paramount organ.

Mounted on wheels, it stands five feet tall and is so unwieldy that a crew of three is needed to operate it. Introduced in 1978 by Edwin H. Land, inventor of the Polaroid Land Camera, the 20 by 24 has evolved from a novelty, intended to impress Polaroid shareholders, to an invaluable photographic tool.\\nRAISON D'ETRE First, portraiture. The film used, Polacolor ER, renders flattering skin tones, making the camera ideal for portraits. Second, art.

Current examples: the September issue of Manner Vogue, with a series of portraits shot by the celebrity photographer Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, and the September issue of Harper's Bazaar, with a photo spread by the film director Tim Burton. Possibly the best known images are of William Wegman's Weimaraners.\\n\\"ACTION!\\" Shooting with the 20 by 24 may be the next best thing to being Steven Spielberg.

In FRA ANGELICO AT SAN MARCO (Yale University, $60), William Hood, a professor of art history at Oberlin College, explores how the artist's piety was translated into a series of frescoes and an altarpiece that have long been cherished for their rich colors and innocent beauty. Mr. Hood argues that Fra Angelico brilliantly reconciled vastly different artistic influences. Outside of the cloister, the Renaissance was developing in Florence, and with it a host of new artistic techniques. However, Mr. Hood writes, Fra Angelico was constrained by centuries-old Dominican artistic traditions. With the aid of many well-chosen illustrations, more than 100 of which are reproduced in color, Mr. Hood shows how the artist selected, altered and combined various stylistic conventions to create his work. Fra Angelico's isolation from the artistic tumult of Florence gave him a certain independence, Mr. Hood maintains","excerpt":"the artist incorporated only those techniques that furthered his own purposes.

Last year we published fifty novels a week, for instance. The short story is out of fashion, and yet literary journals report that they often have as many contributors as subscribers, while poetry magazines are as abundant, if as transient, as dewdrops. These underworlds of literature, the journals that pay contributors mainly in fame and offprints and that suffer from a chronic shortage of advertisers and subscribers, still enjoy a reputation left over from the 1920's, when Joyce, Pound, Eliot and the rest were to be found there; they are thought to be places where the weirdest flowers of literature grow wild in a kind of Rappacini's garden. They are not, however.

But it will still be a while until most people want to listen to live bands who are mashing it up in person. Led by the conductor and guitarist Greg Tate, using a flexible membership of improvisers, and a creative baton-wielding system, the collective Burnt Sugar can make big, messy music. But to counter the mess, there's always some positive ferment going on in the band's new live two-disc set, ''If You Can't Dazzle Them With Your Brilliance Then Baffle Them With Your Blisluth'' (Trugroid). Mr. Tate is more obsessed with density, rhythm and science-fictiony sounds than his mentor, Butch Morris, is. With structures pulled out of the band as the music goes along, this album changes its personality in every track -- swing grooves with violin solos and ensemble riffs, Brazilian rhythm, funk, electronics, fuzzed-out guitar and free jazz. (Try www.othermusic.com.)    Kammerflimmer Kollektief      Similarly, the German band Kammerflimmer Kollektief has been colliding genres, except it does so in short and precise compositions. In ''Absencen'' (Staubgold), this sextet's fifth album, there's some jazz drumming and a double bass, some overtones of country and pop and chamber music, a sputtering saxophone or bass clarinet and a harmonium. It's quite graceful in its contradictions, somewhere between the warm hues of a Daniel Lanois soundscape and the gnatlike movements of European free jazz. Available from www.forcedexposure.com.    Nam June Paik and Jud Yalkut      Recently I went to Eyebeam Gallery (540 West 21st Street, Chelsea) to see ''What Sound Does a Color Make?,'' an art exhibition about the crossroads of sound and image -- where one informs or somehow becomes the other. (Synesthesia is the term used to describe the sensory phenomenon of senses crossing wires in the brain","excerpt":"the artworks shown encourage a synesthetic experience.) I wasn't that into it -- too many of the pieces seemed impersonal and obvious, like the ''visualizations'' option in Windows Media Player, where you can look at EKG-like displays of backbeats as you listen to a song. But the show also includes a little jewel called ''Beatles Electroniques,'' a three-minute collaborative film made between 1966 and 1969 by the multimedia provocateur Nam June Paik and the filmmaker Jud Yalkut. It scrambles visual sequences of a Beatles concert (shot by the artists) with colorful sunbursts made with Mr. Paik's ''video synthesizer''; its tight, cut-up sound loops (try to recognize a Beatles song in it), tied to virtuosic image manipulation, creates a flood of information for the brain. (The exhibition continues through July 16.)    Orthrelm      It's just two guys, Mick Barr (guitar) and Joshua Blair (drums), with a comically evil-sounding name. To them, a song is a very fast and loud repetition of a tiny pattern. ''OV,'' the band's new album (on Ipecac), is one big song, 45 minutes long. To hear it is to know very quickly -- possibly in under five seconds -- whether it will just make you violent, or whether it will inspire a strong urge to look more deeply into it. (It could produce both reactions simultaneously, I guess.) They change their patterns every four minutes or so, but there are microchanges going on constantly: they can't play so fast and hard for that long without subtle physical changes and slight alterations in attack and rhythmic cycling. I still haven't listened to the entire thing. (The fast-forward tracking button gives you a plot summary when you lose patience or get a headache.) It's totally over the top, but I don't hear it either as pretentiousness or a prank: the exultation is real.    Peter Brötzmann/Kenneth Patchen      The work of the poet Kenneth Patchen, who died in 1972, was mellowly surreal, leftist and sensual, full of reverent love for his wife and assurances that the good will rout the evil. (He was boldly unafraid of clichéd ideas, as long as the words to express them were sturdy.) The work of the German saxophonist Peter Brötzmann is a lot more aggressive and tortured, but perhaps that gives him the right critical distance on Patchen. On ''Be Music, Night'' (Okkadisc), Mr. Brotzmann performs with his Chicago Tentet, the most dynamic and arrangement-oriented of his current groups. The Welsh actor and director Mike Pearson reads Patchen's poetry. In some spots the gentle mood of the poetry (and Mr. Pearson's measured delivery) forces Mr. Brötzmann toward a sensitive, swing-era virile-ballad style. In other parts of the work, including a wild solo by the cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm, the band builds up tension and detonates.    Lizz Wright      She's a stupendous singer, but I still can't quite hear who she is. ''Dreaming Wide Awake'' (Verve), Lizz Wright's second album, was produced by Craig Street, the top-shelf architect of chai-latte sonic Americana; 12 years ago he helped create the shrewdly subverted roots music on Cassandra Wilson's breakthrough album, which became the template for Norah Jones and Madeleine Peyroux's later breakthroughs. This sounds very much like a breakthrough, too, with a well-defined patchwork folkishness. It is firmly within the new genre of what some people might call ''genreless'' music, and the list of songwriters -- Neil Young, Joe Henry and Ms. Jones's songwriting partner Jesse Harris -- drive that point home. (It is precisely the sound of the Starbucks aesthetic; if you close your eyes, you can nearly hear the sound of milk being steamed in the background.) I can't get enough of her classic R&B voice, which is precise enough to show you the serifs in the lyrics' typeface. But the album is so choked with market-tested misty softness for its middle-age audience that you end up looking at the artist through a fog.

She's not extreme or reserved. She's neither overtly sexual nor chaste. She's just hugely popular.   Miss Gabriel, who is in her 30's, is one of several Mexican pop stars who have begun cultivating a wider Latin audience, and her fans flock to hear her sing about love and its lack. Ms. Gabriel sings ballads, and in virtually all of them she plays the traditional role of the woman suffering from unrequited love. Song after song had her wishing for the return of a man or of her desire for a new one. Occasionally she rubbed her stomach or breasts to signify a mild sort of lust, but for the most part the desire was more family style. She struck poses or put her head in her hands to get a point across","excerpt":"the audience, which included children and grandparents, was on her side.

She has performed several nights a week, as many as six or seven times a night, shuttling from weddings to anniversary celebrations, bar mitzvahs to birthday parties. The venues, throughout New York City and parts of New Jersey, range from high-end restaurants to dance halls to dives","excerpt":"the audiences are American, Arab, Greek, Turkish, Chinese, Indian. Carucci, a 33-year-old native Israeli, began studying belly dancing when she was 20. Last August, she gave birth to twins and has now resumed dancing. From 2000 to 2003, Carucci photographed her night job. She initially used a 35-millimeter camera for small, narrowly composed shots, typically of her preparations -- in restrooms, on the subway -- for her next performance. Eventually she added a panoramic camera, which allowed her to capture the often raucous and carnival-like atmosphere of her evenings.      She took many of the photographs of herself and other dancers with the help of a timer, though on several occasions the image was taken by her husband, Eran Bendheim. Carucci's previous collection of photos, ''Closer,'' was an intimate, leisurely look at her and her family. But this project was notable for its fleetingness and haste. ''I saw a lot in short periods of time,'' she writes in ''Diary of a Dancer'' (to be published next month, when the photographs will be exhibited at the Ricco/Maresca Gallery in Manhattan). ''And when I was actually dancing even more so.. . .You are both more and less aware of your surroundings, both more and less concentrated on yourself.. . .There are things you see better, more acutely, and there are many things you miss.''

Praskova is an intelligent woman, far removed from the idiocies of her neighbors, and when her husband goes off to war and she takes an Austrian prisoner as her lover she is undisturbed by idle gossip and scornful of the conventions she is accused of violating.Ian","excerpt":"the Austrian, leaves Praskova after he feels that he must join the Red forces in order \\"to end a greater, useless war.\\" The woman, after hours of listening to reasons, consents, logically enough, and he goes off in the rain. Later her husband, now an officer in the White army, marches upon the town in pursuit of the Reds, the leader of which is Ian. Praskova warns her lover of the imminent danger and then suddenly remembers her boy, the love child of Ian and herself, whom she left in the town. She rushes back, with Ian and his army on her heels. There is an encounter and, ironically enough, both husband and lover are killed, leaving Praskova only with the dead.The film is pictorially beautiful, with many attractive shots of landscape during an approaching storm; fields of wind-swept wheat; dun-colored clouds, and peasants hastening to get in the fresh-cut hay. There are also an unusual number of photographs of animals, the Russian directors having apparently discovered the same trick that moves on-lookers to murmur \\"Ah!\\" when the animal pets are shown in the news reels.Mile. Zessarskaya is excellent as Praskova and acts the part with pleasing restraint. Despite her cumbersome peasant's costume and headgear, she often appears exceedingly attractive and gives evidence of an authentic depth of character. The direction is terse, and in the dramatic moments, graphic and without waste.An onlooker would surmise that Russian technique takes for granted a smattering of intelligence on the part of the viewer and therefore only deftly etches the story in a manner unlike much of the Hollywood product.

Steeped in the moral codes of just yesteryear, two Englishwomen (one called Elizabeth, the other Betsy), childhood friends born in 1948, putter in their rooms and in their life until, surprisingly, each of them has an affair with the same married man. It does not turn out well.    ALFRED KAZIN'S AMERICA: Critical and Personal Writings, edited by Ted Solotaroff. (HarperCollins, $29.95.)

Ann Sheridan is his night-clubby moll, and Burgess Meredith is the brilliant, desperate and doomed fomenter of an unsuccessful \\"break.\\" You have met them all before, and whether you care to renew the acquaintance or not, here is an excellent opportunity.At the Cine RomaPersons going to the Cine Roma these days expecting to see just another gay, musical picture, as indicated by the title of the new film, \\"Napoli che non muore\\" (Naples That Never Dies), will be pleasantly surprised.For while this Manenti offering, smoothly directed by Amleto Palermi, does show a bit of the old pre-Fascist Naples, with some fine singing and the well-known air of \\"dolce far niente,\\" this is only a set-up used by a prosperous young business man (Fosco Giacchetti) to impress a lovely and romantic French girl (Maria Glory) and to capture her heart. Then follows the serious side of their married life and the most entertaining part of the piece.The bride at first thinks she is in the land of her dreams, but she soon learns that her husband's fine old home in Sorrento, which he shares with his brother (Cesare Bettarini), the latter's highly sympathetic wife (Paola Barbara) and his business-like mother (Bella Starace Sainati), is becoming a lonely place for her. With her husband away every working day and with her ideas of life clashing sharply with those of her in-laws, the inevitable trouble arrives.How the problem is solved may be learned by visiting the Cine Roma and enjoying the superior acting of the practically all-star cast.

Among other things, he prepared designs for six of the Russian Olympic coins issued to commemorate the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow and also designed the official Apollo-Soyuz medals given to American astronauts during their visit to the Soviet Union.\\n\\nBut, like the hero in ''1984,'' Mr. Shagin bridled at his government's tyrannical rule.

(Houghton Mifflin, $26.) Wills, who says he has never even considered leaving the Roman Catholic Church, explains why, giving en route a condensed history of the papacy and of its growth in recent centuries to aberrant proportions, in need of supervision from the loyal People of God.    BIG IF, by Mark Costello. (Norton, $24.95.) A novel offers an anthropological look at the occupational rituals and argot of a group of Secret Service agents, who are in fact simply stressed-out working stiffs just like us, with the small difference that they are also charged with the continued well-being of the vice president.    LIFE OF PI, by Yann Martel. (Harcourt, $25.) A high-seas adventure tale with a large quotient of allegory, in which Pi Patel, a teenage Indian boy, and a 450-pound tiger named Richard Parker become the only survivors of a shipwreck that swallowed a private zoo belonging to Pi's family.    HART CRANE: A Life, by Clive Fisher. (Yale University, $39.95.) A penetrating, absorbing biography of the American poet, a sensation in his teens, who ended his own life at 32","excerpt":"the author, a British critic, captures the loneliness and pathos of Crane's existence and places his poems where the life illuminates them.    FRAGRANT HARBOR, by John Lanchester. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $25.95.) A novel of large scope, placed chiefly in Hong Kong in 1935 and after, undertaking big propositions: race, class, love, war and, perhaps most successfully, the transformation of a refugee community into one of the world's richest societies.    THE MONK DOWNSTAIRS, by Tim Farrington. (HarperSanFrancisco, $22.95.) A tender, witty novel in which a former monk, after 20 years in his order, rents an apartment from a 38-year-old single mother; the ensuing relationship grows cautiously, taking account of the prudence required of struggling people who aren't going to get that many more chances.    SNOBBERY: The American Version, by Joseph Epstein. (Houghton Mifflin, $25.) In a society more ostensibly egalitarian than ever, Epstein observes, snobbery has proliferated and intensified in new forms, with new peaks from which to look down on others; he fleshes out his perceptions with an examination of his own experience.    THE WHORE'S CHILD: And Other Stories, by Richard Russo. (Knopf, $24.) In these short stories the author of ''Empire Falls,'' this year's Pulitzer Prize novel, abandons working-class settings and protagonists in favor of intellectuals caught in late middle age, worried about illness and ambivalent about marriage.    TWELVE, by Nick McDonell. (Grove, $23.) This accomplished first novel by an 18-year-old tracks the dissolute behavior of some rich kids returning home for the Christmas holidays; its protagonist is a boy called White Mike, who gives up his subway seat to elderly women and neither smokes nor drinks; what he does is deal drugs, in company with characters whose lives converge at a single calamitous party.

A professor of law examines the angry dialogue of several decades between Jefferson, who thought the 13 colonies made 13 sovereignties, and Marshall, who thought the Constitution made them one.

A MULTITUDE OF SINS: Stories, by Richard Ford. (Knopf, $25.) Quite a few wrongs are done in these elegantly worded stories, although what prevails is generally adultery, often depicted at the end of an affair or later, when it's too late to throw those dice again.    THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE, by Ann Beattie. (Scribner, $24.) Does less of minimalism mean more of something else? Beattie's novel explores at some length, in a prose that owes much to the language of therapy, a fraught relationship between a 40-ish woman whose husband is dead and her brother, a flagrant womanizer.    SOROS: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire, by Michael T. Kaufman. (Knopf, $27.50.) A survivor of Nazism and Communism who has made billions is bound to contain paradoxes; personally shy and financially bold, Soros admits he wants to be ''the conscience of the world'' and has given enormous sums to undermine totalitarianism but, as this biography makes clear, cares little for publicity.    SUMMER IN BADEN-BADEN, by Leonid Tsypkin. (New Directions, $23.95.) An extraordinary novel by a Soviet Jewish doctor who died unpublished in 1982; its hero is Dostoyevsky, and its central enigma is the anti-Semitism of a great writer whose fiction is profoundly sensitive to human suffering and the pain of others, proclaiming the right to life and sunshine of every creature not Jewish.    SEARCHING FOR HASSAN: An American Family's Journey Home to Iran, by Terence Ward. (Houghton Mifflin, $25.) The object of this quixotic, colorful and amusing search all over Iran by Ward and his family was not so much home as Hassan Ghasemi and his family, who had worked for the Wards 40 years earlier. Miraculously, they found them, and miraculously, all was well.    ATONEMENT, by Ian McEwan. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $26.) The idyllic situation of an English family in 1935 disintegrates, starting with a crime; World War II is no help either in this novel by a writer who has the power to convey obsession and also to step outside and see how obsession looks to others.    THE SHELL COLLECTOR: Stories, by Anthony Doerr. (Scribner, $23.)

A LIFE IN PIECES: The Making and Unmaking of Binjamin Wilkomirski, by Blake Eskin. (Norton, $25.95.) In 1997, Wilkomirski's ''Fragments'' was much admired as a masterpiece of Holocaust writing; since then, both author and book have faded into fraudulence. Eskin's research now illuminates not the Holocaust but the fantasy life of a disturbed young man with an unhappy childhood whose real name Eskin himself is not altogether sure of.

A rich, spacious and humane first novel, set in the 19th century, by a Dutch writer whose protagonist, an Ashanti prince from the Gold Coast, is more or less taken hostage in the 1830's and compelled to live out his life in an exile that places no value on a black man.    HITLER. 1936-45: Nemesis, by Ian Kershaw. (Norton, $35.) The second and final volume of Kershaw's biography sees in its subject an unerring sense of other people's weaknesses, fears and vanities, the mental equipment of a malign guru whose followers could project their worst fantasies onto him.

SCHMIDT DELIVERED, by Louis Begley. (Knopf, $25.)

Mr. Ballard, the author of ''Empire of the Sun,'' said he rejected designation this year as a commander of the British Empire (C.B.E.) for ''services to literature'' because he regarded the honors system as a ''preposterous charade.'' He said: ''Thousands of medals are given out in the name of a nonexistent empire. It makes us look a laughingstock and encourages deference to the crown.'' The leaked government papers revealed that as many as one in five of those who turned down an honor later accepted one.

Possible hazards of electromagnetic radiation are one problem that must be thoroughly studied and addressed by shielding or some other method.   The comparison with the Japanese bullet train (shinkansen) by power per passenger is misleading. The bullet train achieves a high rating in this category because hefty employees shove 300 passengers into cars designed for 100.    True, passengers will not be allowed to stand in the aisles of a maglev vehicle going 300 miles per hour. But speed is a necessity, and becoming more so, because of the trend toward lighter-weight, more valuable cargoes and the increasing value of people's time. William B. Johnston of the Hudson Institute has observed that \\"In our future transportation needs, the rising importance of time stands out as the single most important and most overlooked issue.\\"   The expense of maglev research and development is justified by its enormous potential. Intercity transport in the United States for trips of up to 400 miles consists of fuel-inefficient jet flights and even more inefficient auto trips. The short flights clog up the airspace at hub airports, which are on the verge of a congestion crisis","excerpt":"the autos jam highways and befoul the air. Maglev can replace many jet flights and car trips, relieving both air and highway congestion, while also eliminating a great deal of petroleum use.    Add to that the opportunity to develop and build an emerging technology that could revitalize our laboratories, universities and economy as the space race did in the 1960's, and it is evident that maglev simply cannot be ignored.

Edited by Roger D. Abrahams. (Pantheon, Cloth, $22.95. Paper, $11.95.) In this sequel to his 1983 volume, ''African Folktales,'' Roger D. Abrahams has culled stories from American and Caribbean collections. Taken together, these tales reveal a world view marked by a gritty sense of realism. The good do not often triumph","excerpt":"the bad are inevitably more interesting character types. From creation myths to coded tales in which plantation masters are outwitted, the stories range across the heritage of an African past planted and tilled in the minds of slaves and their descendants. Mr. Abrahams's introduction traces the history of the tale collectors themselves, paying special tribute to Joel Chandler Harris, whose Uncle Remus and Brer Rabbit tales, he concedes, had racist undertones. Nevertheless, Harris rendered the exploits of animals with human qualities in a literary style quite close to the oral traditions out of which they came. Mr. Abrahams is not romantic about how the tales changed in their passage through the years and from Africa to the New World. Praise songs, epics and long genealogical recitations did not transplant. Perhaps this accounts for the more entertaining qualities of the previous collection; the immediacy of the mother culture gave the African folk tales more vivid moments.

Or, not at first glance -- nobody can find anything on the Internet at first glance. But if you have time on your hands, if you're comfortable with computing, and if you have an unflagging curiosity about sex -- in other words, if you're a teen-ager -- you may think you've suddenly landed in pornography heaven. Nude pictures! Foul language! Weird bathroom humor! No wonder the Christian Coalition thinks the Internet is turning into a red-light district. There's even a \\"Red Light District\\" World Wide Web page.   So we explore. Some sites make you promise to be a grown-up. (O.K.: you promise.) You try \\"Girls,\\" a link leading to a computer at the University of Bordeaux, France. The message flashes back: Document Contains No Data. \\"Girls\\" at Funet, Finland, seems to offer lots of pictures (Dolly Parton! Ivana Trump!) -- Connect Timed Out. \\"Girls,\\" courtesy of Liberac University of Technology, Czech Republic, does finally, with painful slowness, deliver itself of a 112,696-byte image of Madchen Amick. You could watch it spread across your screen, pixel by tantalizing pixel, but instead you go have lunch during the download, and when you return, there she is -- in black-and-white and wearing clothes.    These pictures, by the way, are obviously scanned from magazines. And magazines are the ideal medium for them. Clearly the battle cry of the on-line voyeur is \\"Host Contacted -- Waiting for Reply.\\"   With old Internet technology, retrieving and viewing any graphic image on a PC at home could be laborious. New Internet technology, like browsers for the Web, makes all this easier, though it still takes minutes for the typical picture to squeeze its way through your modem. Meanwhile, though, ease of use has killed off the typical purveyor of dirty pictures, capable of serving hundreds of users a day but uninterested in handling hundreds of thousands. The Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers has turned off its \\"Femmes femmes femmes je vous aime\\" Web page. The good news for erotica fans is that users are redirected to a new site where \\"You can find naked women, including topless and total nudity\\"","excerpt":"the bad news is that this new site is the Louvre.   The Internet does offer access to hundreds of sex \\"newsgroups,\\" forums for discussion encompassing an amazing spectrum of interests. They're easy to find -- in the newsgroup hierarchy \\"alt.sex\\" (\\"alt\\" for alternative) comes right after \\"alt.sewing.\\" And yes, alt.sex is busier than alt.sewing. But quite a few of them turn out to be sham and self-parody. Look at alt.sex.fish -- practically nothing. Alt.sex.bestial ity -- aha! just what Jesse Helms fears most -- gives way to alt.sex.bestiality.hamster.duct-tape, and fascinating as this sounds, when you call it up you find it's empty, presumably the vestige of a short-lived joke. Alt.sex.bondage.particle-physics is followed by alt.sex.sheep.baaa.baaa.baaa.moo -- help!   Still, if you look hard enough, there is grotesque stuff available. If pornography doesn't bother you, your stomach may be curdled by the vulgar commentary and clinical how-to's in the militia and gun newsgroups. Your local newsstand is a far more user-friendly source of obscenity than the on-line world, but it's also true that, if you work at it, you can find plenty on line that will disgust you, and possibly even disgust your children.   This is the justification for an effort in Congress to give the Federal Government tools to control the content available on the Internet. The Communications Decency Act, making its way through Congress, aims to transform the obscene-phone-call laws into a vehicle for prosecuting any Internet user, bulletin-board operator, or on-line service that knowingly makes obscene material available.   As originally written, the bill would not only have made it a crime to write lewd E-mail to your lover; it would also have made it a crime for your Internet provider to transmit it. After a round of lobbying from the large on-line services, the bill's authors have added \\"defenses\\" that could exempt mere unwitting carriers of data, and they say it is children, not consenting adults, they aim to protect. Nevertheless, the legislation is a historically far-reaching attempt at censorship on a national scale.   The Senate authors of this language do not use E-mail themselves, or browse the Web, or chat in newsgroups, and their legislation reflects a mental picture of how the on-line world works that does not match the reality. The existing models for Federal regulation of otherwise protected speech -- for example, censorship of broadcast television and prohibition of harassing telephone calls -- come from a world that is already vanishing over the horizon. There aren't three big television networks now, serving a unified mass market; there are thousands of television broadcasters serving ever-narrower special interests. And on the Internet, the number of broadcasters is rapidly approaching the number of users: uncountable.   With Internet use spreading globally, most live sources of erotic images already seem to be overseas. The sad reality for Federal authorities is that they cannot cut those off without forcing the middlemen -- on-line services in the United States -- to do the work of censorship, and that work is a practical impossibility. Any teen-ager with an account on Prodigy can use its new Web browser to search for the word \\"pornography\\" and click his way to \\"Femmes femmes femmes\\" (oh, well, better luck next time). Policing discussion groups presents the would-be censor with an even more hopeless set of choices. A typical Internet provider carries more than 10,000 groups. As many as 100 million new words flow through them every day. The actual technology of these discussion groups is hard to fathom at first. They are utterly decentralized. Every new message begins on one person's computer and propagates outward in waves, like a chain letter that could eventually reach every mailbox in the world. Legislators would like to cut off a group like alt.sex.bondage.particle-physics at the source, or at its home -- but it has no source and no home, or rather, it has as many homes as there are computers carrying newsgroups.    This is the town-square speech the First Amendment was for: often rancorous, sometimes harsh and occasionally obscene. Voices do carry farther now. The world has never been this global and this intimate at once. Even seasoned Internet users sometimes forget that, lurking just behind the dozen visible participants in an out-of-the-way newsgroup, tens of millions of potential readers can examine every word they post.   If a handful of people wish to share their private experiences with like-minded people in alt.sex. fetish.hair, they can do so, efficiently -- the most fervent wishes of Congress notwithstanding -- and for better or worse, they'll have to learn that children can listen in. Meanwhile, if gun-wielding extremists wish to discuss the vulnerable points in the anatomy of F.B.I. agents, they too can do so. At least the rest of us can listen in on them, too. Perhaps there is a grain of consolation there -- instead of censorship, exposure to the light. Anyway, the only real alternative now would be to unwire the Information Superhighway altogether.

The rates for the 185 participating Marriott Hotels in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Mexico (not Marriott's Courtyard, Residence or Fairfield Inns) start at $49 a night on weekends, a discount of 55 percent off regular prices, and $59 a night on weekdays, and range up to $139 in Hawaii on the weekend and $192 in New York on weekdays. Up to five people may occupy a room; one or two children aged 10 or younger may eat free from a children's menu for each adult entree ordered at breakfast, lunch or dinner.

The rates vary by hotel, with the lowest nightly rate $49; half the 277 properties are offering rates of $59 a night or less.

It is, without doubt, the first best seller in the history of the Times list to present, thanks to some frighteningly adept Photoshop fakery, naked pictures of all nine Supreme Court justices. Stewart's book bumps ''The Family,'' Kitty Kelley's drive-by parsing of all things Bush, down to No. 2. Still, if Kelley's track record is any clue, she's in for an extended run. Her Sinatra book, ''His Way,'' lingered on the Times list for nearly six months in 1986 and 1987, and her other rowdy unauthorized biographies (of Jackie Onassis, Elizabeth Taylor, Nancy Reagan and the British royal family) each spent two to three months on the list.

On Long Island, the season ends Dec. 31, and the daily limit is one bird.   Grouse behave differently in the dead of winter. The jittery birds that often flush just out of range when October's red-gold leaves are still falling are inclined toward concealment rather than flight when snow begins to pile up. They also tend to band together at that time of year, and sometimes a hunter will put up a half- dozen of them at once. In winter, therefore, a hunter without a dog should not simply skirt likely spots - dense hemlocks, spruces or blowdowns - counting on his proximity to send the birds aloft. He may have to virtually step on them before they take wing. A pointer or a flushing dog is of great assistance to the upland hunter, but there will be days in some areas when deep, soft snow may be too much for a dog to traverse successfully.

Like most of the other movie records of the revolution, it brandishes the clenched fist all over the screen, the narrative accompaniment is flamboyantly Loyalist and the same cannon recurrently fires the same shell at the same target. War, in these documentary films, has a familiar face — familiar, even though we rarely get close enough to it to make out its features.For the undramatic fact of the matter is that war camera men are as discreet as authentic combatants. Unlike Hollywood's sham battles, where hand-to-hand encounters, raids and exploding shells occur (if shells can be said to occur) within close-up range of the camera, the Spanish war—with partial exceptions—refuses to sit still long enough to have its picture taken. And photographers on the Spanish front are not to be blamed for preferring to remain behind their gunners and when nothing better offers to take pictures of them firing away at an unseen—but felt—enemy. Occasionally, of course, even this has its hazards, as when an Insurgent soldier charged a machine-gun pit in which the camera man was standing and tossed a grenade at his feet.Except for that moment, and possibly a few others, it is not too exciting a record. It is the anarchist front that the picture reviews","excerpt":"the baggy-trousered, bereted battalions of the F. A. I. (Iberian Anarchist Federation) and the C. N. T.

The early sequences were the most interesting, chiefly for their depiction of the untrained, undisciplined, ill-equipped civilian recruits moving up to the front in lorries, carts, sight-seeing buses, private automobiles and bearing themselves most uncertainly into battle.After a long diet of Hollywood-made war scenes, it is a little disconcerting to see soldiers skulking along, diving for shelter, standing around in timid conversational groups instead of boldly charging the foe. The taking of a salient or a town can be dull pictorially, even though the narrator's voice breaks with excitement one moment and with indignation the next as the camera points out the ruins. (It is always the Insurgents who have done the damage, the narrator insists. If we took his word for it, we should have to conclude that Loyalist shells have a tonic effect). Fragment though it is, however, \\"Fury Over Spain\\" adds its little chapter to the bloody history of the Spanish revolution.

Indeed, the top-bracket rate was raised to 63 percent from 24 percent, while other rates were increased somewhat less sharply.

APRIL 17, 1964  An enthusiastic crowd of 50,312 settles into a sea of orange and blue seats -- orange for the New York Giants, blue for the Brooklyn Dodgers -- and watches the Mets lose, 4-3, to the Pittsburgh Pirates in Shea's inaugural game. Shea himself christens the ballpark with two bottles of water: one from the Harlem River near the Polo Grounds, former home of the Giants, and the other from the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, the closest waterway anyone could find to the Dodgers' Ebbets Field.    AUG. 15, 1965  The Beatles play to 55,000 fans at Shea, inventing the stadium rock concert and cementing the band's reputation. The screams of concertgoers, who pay as much as $5.75 for seats, are deafening: ''As for what they sang or how they sounded, your guess is as good as mine,'' wrote Sandi Polacco, a fan who was there, on the Lively Set, a music Web site. For the record, the program included ''Dizzy Miss Lizzy'' and ''Can't Buy Me Love.''    JUNE 27, 1967  The makers of ''The Odd Couple,'' the movie comedy starring Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, film a scene at Shea in which a batter hits into a triple play. The Mets are facing the Pittsburgh Pirates that day, and their star outfielder, Roberto Clemente, is originally pegged for the role. Clemente declines the job and the $100 pay, not wanting to appear weak at the plate. Pirates second baseman Bill Mazeroski takes the offer instead, nailing the hit in two takes and achieving film immortality with Felix and Oscar.    OCT. 16, 1969  In the sixth inning of Game 5 of the Mets' first World Series, a pitch by Dave McNally of the Orioles zips by Mets left fielder Cleon Jones and into the dugout. Jones complains that the ball hit him in the foot, but the umpire disagrees. Mets manager Gil Hodges emerges from the dugout and produces the ball, which features a smudge of black polish, presumably from Jones's shoe. Jones is awarded first base and the team goes on to win the game, 5-3, clinching the championship and earning the title ''Miracle Mets.''    JUNE 10, 1975  Playing in Shea for the second straight season as their stadium is renovated, the Yankees present a 21-gun salute in honor of Army Day. The cannons are filled with blanks, but the blast is such that part of the outfield wall is toppled, and another section is set on fire, and some windows are broken. The stadium fills with smoke and the game, against the California Angels, is delayed.    OCT. 25, 1986  During Game 6 of the Mets-Red Sox World Series, a soap opera actor named Michael Sergio parachutes onto the field, trailing a ''Go Mets'' banner. He and Ron Darling, the Mets pitcher, slap hands cheerfully before Sergio is escorted from the field and to jail. It soon emerges that Sergio was trying to win an ''outrageous acts'' radio contest on WXRK-FM, then the home station of Howard Stern. He loses. In the same game a weak grounder from the Mets' Mookie Wilson crawls through the legs of Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner and into right field. Boston fans know the rest.    MAY 3, 1998  One or more people break into a storage room at Shea and abscond with uniforms, balls, bats and a unicycle belonging to Mr. Met, the eternally optimistic team mascot. ''The people knew they were taking from Mr. Met,'' Derek Dye, then in his inaugural year as the mascot, bitterly tells The Village Voice. Strangely, the iconic, baseball-shaped head of Mr. Met is not taken or even defaced, leaving open the question of whether the thieves might have been Mets supporters. ''Maybe there was a little teeny bit of respect,'' Dye says.    OCT. 26, 2000  The Mets reach the World Series for the first time in 14 years, but on this day their bid for a championship ends in Game 5 to the Yankees. It is the first Subway Series since the Yankees beat the Dodgers in 1956.

It was the official opening (after warmup club shows in Los Angeles) of the band's first American tour since 1991. On Tuesday, Warner Brothers Records is to release ''Kettle Whistle,'' an album of alternate versions of old songs along with two new ones.     In some ways, the tour and album are standard procedure for cashing in on an enduring trademark. But Mr. Farrell never wastes an opportunity for hallucinatory spectacle.

Its recordings offered reliable, inexpensive exposure to much of the standard repertory. Despite rough edges in the playing and often uninspired leadership, the performances possessed a basic honesty.   To judge from the orchestra's concerts with Christoph Eschenbach last Sunday afternoon and on Wednesday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, the honesty and the roughnesses remain. So, it appeared, does the concentration on standard repertory, at least for export. Sunday's program was all Beethoven: the \\"Prometheus\\" Overture, the Third Piano Concerto and the \\"Eroica\\" Symphony.

One of rock's tenets is never to use a violin player, and this band did. The results were lachrymose and huffy, even though the fault didn't always lie with the violin player.    The band, which has a good reputation among rock connoisseurs, walked through a set of gray and dire pieces. Its lead singer, Simon Bonney, head cocked, did a lot of intoning, half braying and half talking through lines like \\"This road is my road/this road is your road/this road is our road.\\" And the songs were filled with rhymes that clanked.

Mr. Lurie had the cellist Jane Scarpantoni and the tenor saxophonist Michael Blake pair off to play melodies alone. Some tunes sped up and slowed down, with the horn section coming in at a different tempo than the rhythm section. Mr. Lurie set the guitarist Dave Tronzo and Ms. Scarpantoni, along with some horns, to buzzing with overtones; dissonant, dense and shivering clouds of sound emerged. Impressionistic harmonies contrasted with tough rhythm-and-blues, and the joy of full-band, blaring polyphony was set against the introspection of Mr. Lurie's own improvisations, often sensual and cool.

The trove comes from the collection of Bill Graham, the concert promoter who died in a helicopter crash in 1991.

Video materials include a Who concert in 1973 at the Cow Palace, where Keith Moon fell into his drum kit; and the Sex Pistols' final concert. Mr. Sagan said he hoped that CD's and DVD's of some shows could reach the market by the end of the year.

In the film, Mr. Blades's character lands a lucrative recording contract by switching from salsa to American pop music, but enjoys only fleeting success. In real life, Mr. Blades's two musically eclectic, politically committed, Spanish-language ''crossover'' albums have likewise sold disappointingly, despite nearly unanimous critical acclaim.   Meanwhile, ''Conga,'' a song by the Cuban-American group Miami Sound Machine, has reached No. 10 on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 singles chart","excerpt":"the band's ''Primitive Love'' LP (Epic BFE 40131, also available on cassette) is currently at No. 42 on the magazine's pop album list. ''Conga,'' although it is sung in English and features a heavy funk drumbeat, is based on the rhythms of the Cuban conga, a line dance traditionally performed during carnival festivities. For the four original members who founded Miami Sound Machine more than a decade ago, crossover dreams have indeed come true.

Ms. Khan, who has disappeared and reappeared sporadically since the mid-1980's, has returned to performing with voice and moxie intact.

Mr. Thomas, though, has been looking backward as well as forward for his inspiration - not back to the 60's or the 50's, as is fashionable now, but all the way back to his childhood.   A child's playful use of language and unstructured approach to noisemaking is the closest analogue for what Mr. Thomas and his band are up to. In the past, Mr. Thomas's performances have tended to be a little too determined, evocations of spontaneity rather than the thing itself. But his new band, the Wooden Birds, is able to follow his sing-song cadences and tale-telling while also providing some spine and bottom.

The first step is to report the loss to the local police, in the city where the loss was discovered. I had to complete a form, giving details of the loss. This was properly authorized, and I was given a duplicate to take with me to the consulate in Florence. I was then instructed to have passport photos made (four in all; the caveat here is to be sure they are passport size, not driver's license size; I spent an extra half hour and an additional $14 having the right size reshot).   The process once I returned to the consulate (which is on the Arno a few blocks from the Ponte Vecchio) was simple: a form to complete, photos and the police report verifying the loss; the cost is $40 (in lire, traveler's checks or dollars, but it is advisable to have exact change, as I was told that they had no change). The passport is given to you within minutes and is valid for 10 years.   Be sure to check the hours of the consulate before going; some close as early as 12:30 P.M.

In this case, the singers and the choruses are from the Paris Opera Comique and they all seem to have good, strong voices which they enthusiastically use.

Louis Musy acts Bartholo, the lady's guardian, with much pomposity and the role of Figaro, the barber, is sung loudly by Roger Bussonet.But, for all their combined outpouring of Rossini's romantic score, which to some ears may be satisfying as music and nothing else, they fail to present a creation in visual images of anything more than a series of scenes of opera singers pumping air with their lungs. The numbers are lengthy, monotonous and generally unrelieved by even the simplest sort of cutting or juxtaposition of shots. And the dialogue is stiff and bombastic when it is crudely injected between songs. Like the Italian film version of the same opera, presented here two years ago, this effort is ponderous and static.

Shoppers for shoes, bags and clothes are having similar surprises. People still remember when it was as cheap to eat out as at home, but no longer. However, the best things in Rome really are free, from the view from the Janiculum Hill to the Pantheon (a functioning church) to a drink from a fountain (connoisseurs like the one on Via IV Novembre at the top of Salita del Grillo). And the second best things cost very little. TOUR BY TRAM OR BUS.  The 30/ (say \\"trenta barrato\\") tram line starts its route at the Porta San Paolo, near the Stazione Ostiense (a secondary railroad station with Line B metro stop) and the Pyramid of Gaius Cestius, a late first-century B.C. funerary monument that was incorporated into the walls of Rome in the third century A.D. (to which the Porta San Paolo belonged). A couple of blocks away is the Protestant Cemetery. The 30/ wends its way slowly past the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the Circus Maximus, the Palatine Hill and the Colosseum","excerpt":"the Basilicas of St. John Lateran, Santa Croce, and San Lorenzo; the University of Rome, the trendy San Lorenzo quarter, and the Campo Verano cemetery; then turns toward chic Parioli and the zoo, to end at Piazza Thorvaldsen, a few steps from your choice of the Gallery of Modern Art, the Villa Giulia Museum of Etruscan Art, the Villa Borghese and a number of the foreign academies, which often have free art exhibitions.   A single regular bus ticket allows unlimited transfers on buses and trams within a 75-minute period. You stamp the ticket in a machine on the bus or tram each time you board. The last stamp must be within 75 minutes of the first, but you can stay on the last bus or tram as long as you like after you stamp your ticket. The ticket also includes a ride on the Metropolitana, or subway (you get one time through the turnstile, but you can transfer free; there are only two lines). If you buy a block of 10 tickets, you get one ticket free. These can be bought at tobacconists and special booths at major bus stops. The 30/ run takes 45 minutes to an hour.   A DAY AT OSTIA ANTICA.  On a regular city bus ticket, take the little train to Scavi (\\"excavations\\") di Ostia Antica from the Stazione Ostiense near the Pyramid. Ostia was the port of ancient Rome, situated at what used to be the mouth of the Tiber. Admission to the site, which, like Pompeii, is a large part of an excavated ancient city, is only about $4.80, calculated at a rate of 1,629 lire to $1. The brick buildings of Ostia glow in the sun, and the pine trees and sea breeze insure a pleasant respite from the city heat. The site is open all day, but the wonderful museum, containing marvelous sculptures and other excavated objects, is open only in the morning. The standard tour includes the forum, the theater (where plays are performed on summer evenings), various bath complexes, warehouses and private dwellings, a little restaurant-bar, called themopolium, and the House of Diana, an apartment building. But it's easy to find an untraveled spot to sit quietly and eat a discreet picnic. HOTEL IN THE GREENERY.  Although they are not the bargains they once were, Rome's small, mid-level hotels can offer charm, comfort and convenience at acceptable prices. One hotel much appreciated by frequent visitors for good value in a country-villa setting is the 50-room Sant'Anselmo, 2 Piazza Sant'Anselmo, (396) 5783214, fax (396) 5783604, double including breakfast $114. The Aventine Hill (one of the seven), where it is situated, is an exclusive residential quarter and one of Rome's greenest. It's a short walk to the Pyramid of Gaius Cestius and minutes by bus to the heart of Rome.   A VIEW, OR JUST BREAKFAST.  For the price of a cappuccino, or an apertif or a sandwich, a cat can look at a king for pretty much as long as he wants. Caffe Rosati on Piazza del Popolo is an elegant old bar with outdoor tables commanding one of the best views-cum-people-watching in town. If you can possibly avoid having breakfast in your hotel, a cappuccino and cornetto (croissant), every Roman's favorite eye-opener, will cost only $1.60 if you stand at the bar, and $5.40 if you sit. Hotel breakfasts can cost $9 to $16 and will never taste as good. WALK THROUGH ANCIENT ROME.  Many people dream of creating a unified archeological park of Rome's great monumental zone, from Piazza Venezia all the way out the Via Appia Antica. The fact is that, except for the traffic, it already exists -- it's all in one's perception. Although admission is charged for the Roman Forum and Palatine (one ticket, but free the last Sunday of the month) and the Colosseum (for the upper levels; the rest is free), the Forum and some of the Palatine and the Imperial Fora can be viewed most excitingly from street level. The Circus Maximus is wide open, and much appreciated by joggers. From there, you can jog, or cycle (or taxi), down the Via delle Terme di Caracalla, view the Baths, and continue through the most beautiful gate in the most beautiful stretch of the Aurelian Wall. After the catacombs (not visible from the road) comes ancient Rome's main highway, lined with tombs. FOR LUNCH, STAND FOR PIZZA.  Two meals in a trattoria is too much in one day. Many Romans have their lunch at a pizza a taglio (by the slice) stand, and possibly the best of these is the wonderfully old-fashioned Pizzeria Silvana, at 29 Via del Governo Vecchio, in the heart of old Rome. Lunch will cost only about $1.80. Silvana's system is this: a constant supply of yardlong plain white pizza comes out of the oven (smelling divine). The customer indicates by whatever means at his disposal, verbal or non-, how large a piece he would like, and then chooses a condiment, which is then stuffed generously into the pizza. Try tuna and artichokes, or bresaola-rughetta(the Roman name for arugula)-Parmesan, or shrimp and porcini mushrooms. The house beverage, offered gratis, is acqua minerale you pour yourself from bottles set out on the counter. There are no seats. You can either eat standing up, rubbing shoulders (possibly literally) with a very genuine cross-section of Roman society, including so many policemen that at times you wonder if a crime has been committed, or you walk to nearby Piazza Navona, sit on a bench and contemplate Bernini's fountain. At that point you might as well walk over to Bar Tre Scalini for a chocolate ice cream tartufo, $3 if you stand, $6.60 if you sit at a table and look at the view. SHOP IN A MONASTERY.  The monks of Camaldoli have been in the pharmacy business since 1048. In Rome, their products are sold in a little shop adjacent to the monastery attached to the church of San Gregorio al Celio, in Via San Gregorio, near the Circus Maximus and Palatine. About $9 buys a digestive amaro or a sweet wine or an aperitif. There are also chocolates, therapeutic tisanes, and hard candies, perfumes, honeys and \\"honey specialties.\\" There are also jams and jellies; the confitura di marroni is wonderful: imagine spreading marrons glaces (glazed chestnuts) on your morning toast. BROWSE FOR PRINTS AND BOOKS.  Nestled among some of the priciest shops in Rome, at Piazza Borghese, a short walk from the Spanish Steps, is a wonderful outdoor book and print market. (Walk all the way down Via Condotti, across Via del Corso, and keep going.) Trained eyes can pick out some rare first editions or original etchings, but for the rest of us, it's a place for leisurely browsing ending in the purchase of a very nice reproduction print that will cost less than $30, and more likely around $9. The adjacent Palazzo Borghese has a beautiful garden with statues and picturesque cats. You can try asking the guard to let you have a peek.

Where many rockers turn introspective as they move toward middle age, Mr. Hiatt has decided to howl louder.   Although he is one of the best word-slingers among American songwriters -- \\"You're under my skin like a submarine\\" -- Mr. Hiatt delights in the wordless pleasures of rock: the impact of a power chord or a tom-tom socked on an offbeat; a vocal that turns into growls or falsetto whoops. His voice is a baritone with a trapdoor into the bass range; he can invoke the nasal tension of country singing and the full-throated release of soul shouting. Onstage, he mugs through his songs, rubber-faced and intent on every detail, putting thumb and forefinger together in a line about smoke rings, holding up both arms to gesture like a preacher, rolling his eyes and jerking his chin in happy reaction to one of Michael Ward's squealing guitar solos.

A8    NATIONAL  A9-16    New Orleans Levees Fail, Leaving City Uninhabitable  A day after New Orleans thought it had narrowly escaped the worst of Hurricane Katrina, water broke through two levees and all but submerged the city, causing incalculable destruction and rendering it uninhabitable for weeks to come.  A1    Word that the devastated New Orleans area would not be habitable at least until next week reverberated through the hotels and motels scattered along highways in every direction, as hundreds of thousands of evacuees who had packed limited provisions grappled with the new reality of long-term evacuation.  A1    Until engineers can repair breaks in the huge levees that separate New Orleans from Lake Pontchartrain, the city will essentially be an arm of the Gulf of Mexico, subject to the ebb and flow of the tides.  A10    As federal officials rushed medical equipment and experts to the Gulf Coast, they warned that the public health consequences of Hurricane Katrina are likely to be enormous and long-term.

A9    SAT Math Scores Set Record  Scores on the College Board's math SAT test hit a record high of 520 last year, but verbal scores remained flat at 508, well below their historic high, the College Board said.  A16    NEW YORK/REGION  B1-8         Poll Gives Bloomberg Large Lead Over Rivals  New York City Democrats are largely unimpressed with their field of mayoral candidates for the coming primary election, and nearly half of them believe that Mayor Bloomberg, a Republican, deserves re-election, according to the latest New York Times poll.   A1    Judge Arrested in Sting  David A. Gross, a Nassau County judge who is running for re-election in November, was arraigned on federal money-laundering charges along with three men whom prosecutors said were linked to the Genovese crime family.

Rather, the frankest sort of humor and the broadest sort of \\"boffing\\" is employed to make it perfectly sure that everybody gets exactly what the producers are aiming to reveal.The first episode is an exception—the first of these little bedroom tales that are told by four gentlemen travelers who become stalled one foggy night in a roadside lodge. It is a British soldier's recollection of going to billet one night in a small French home and having to help deliver a baby instead of getting the night's sleep he deeply craved.As played by Richard Todd as the soldier and Jeanne Moreau as the girl who has the child, it is an obvious but rather touching incident on the strictly sentimental side—which is something the other three episodes are definitely anything but.For instance, the second recollection is that of a French diplomat who tells of the boudoir adventures of a superstitious little Parisian fille de joie whose career is considerably affected by the possession of a bed that belonged to Mme. Pompadour, It is a hodge-podge of farcical maneuverings—lovers popping out of windows or behind screens while a succession of dignified statesmen arrive to visit the girl. It is droll but also very obvious—on the order of a French revue skit. Bernard Blier as the foremost French statesman and Martine Carol as the girl are apt farceurs.Best of the quartet of fables is that which comes third in the set—the reverie of a youthful truck driver who has an encounter on the road with a streamlined girl. This one is rendered beguiling by the genial and whimsical air of the hail-fellow-well-met truck driver, played amusingly by Marcel Mouloudji. It doesn't strain the imagination in suggesting what is on this fellow's mind, and the terminal blackout is deflative. But it does now and then effervesce.Plainly the importers of this picture have staked their commercial hopes on the fourth and final episode, in which Dawn Addams and Vittorio de Sica are involved. For they have dubbed English dialogue into this one, so that it may be thoroughly understood (even though the quality of the dialogue is not exceptional), and they have let it run on and on.It tells of a prearranged encounter of a gentleman seeking a divorce with a professional correspondent in a New York hotel room—as sleazy and unpleasant a subject as we can imagine for the purpose of wholesome fun. And even though it is made somewhat silly by having the girl's fiancé call through the night and is topped with a very moral blackout, it is not the kind of farce that nudges the ribs.Miss Addams appears about on the level of her talents, but it is disappointing to see Mr. de Sica in this sort of jape.

As such we have no hesitation in recommending the Paramount's new film as a pleasant and diverting animated picture-book, drawn in the brightest Technicolor, happily free from ogres, hobgoblins and other nightmare-breeders, and so broad in its humor that the littlest 4-year-old can scarcely miss its jokes.But, by any other standards than those of the juvenile audience, the film is so far beneath the level of Mr. Disney's famous fantasy that, out of charity, we wish we did not have to make the comparisons demanded by professional responsibility. If it were only possible to soften the blow by suggesting that the second feature cartoon automatically loses the novelty-value of the first, we should be cushioning our typewriter with the excuse right now. But it is far more than novelty that \\"Gulliver\\" lacks: it is the wit, the freshness, the gayety and sparkle, the subtlety, the characterization and, for that matter, the good drawing that are the trademarks of the Disney factory.Pointedly enough, the best parts of the Fleischer show are those which are most reminiscent of Disney: the comet-like course of the lamp-bearing town crier of Lilliput when the first sight of Gulliver sends him rocketing through the city to spread the alarm, the Lilliputian methods of repairing the human giant's wardrobe, the music-box effect of the harmonic snores of King Little and other members of his court. And pointedly, too, the worst parts of it were Disney stumbling blocks also: inability to make a little Prince and Princess anything but expressionless dolls, to crease a natural human face into a smile or frown without the lines and shadows performing a square dance.For comic cartoon purposes they have used only the roughest outline of the Jonathan Swift satire about Lemuel Gulliver, the shipwrecked sailor who came ashore in Lilliput, where the folk were only thumb-high but just as cantankerous and warlike as full-grown members of the race facetiously known as human. That is the beginning and virtually the end of the synopsis—since animators have material aplenty just in the notion of a working crew of Lilliputians trying to capture a man seventy times their size—but, for good measure, they have tossed in the Prince of Blefuscu and the Princess of Lilliput whose wedding is called off, and war declared, because King Little insists that his anthem, \\"Faithful,\\" be sung at the wedding and King Bombo is adamant about the singing of his anthem, \\"Forever.\\"Some parts of it are amusing enough to adults, even by Disney standards. The capture of Gulliver, with block and tackle and monumental Lilliputian energy, is chuckling fantasy","excerpt":"the behavior of Bombo's three spies is good burlesque in the Three Stooges tradition, and we enjoyed the sequence when Gabby—the would-be Dopey of \\"Gulliver\\"—is blubbering about his indigestibility, his wife and kids—\\"millions of em.\\" The score is fair enough, thanks to Lee Robin and Ralph Rainger and to Jessica Dragonette and Lanny Ross, who sing their tunes; but even the score is familiar, a blend of \\"Snow White\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" The children, of course, won't be so critical: whether it's Disney, Fleischer or Mervyn LeRoy, fantasy in picture-book form is just what they want for Christmas.

The tide of renown has ebbed somewhat but the interest perks on, and there are at least four books on her in varying stages of preparation. A biography by Edward Butscher is scheduled for August, 1975 publication by Continuum Books, and two others, one by Harriet Rosenstein (a critical biography for Knopf) and the other by Lois Ames (Harper & Row); are in the works. And next spring Harper & Row will publish a collection of Miss Plath's letters, edited by her mother, Aurelia Plath, and entitled &#8220;Letters Home.&#8221; Frances McCullough Mrs. Plath's editor, learned of the letters from Lois Ames and asked Mrs. Plath to let her read them. She thought they were a book and persuaded Mrs. Plath to allow publication. The next steps were winnowing down the mass of material (there were over 1,000 letters) to book size and getting permission from Miss Plath's husband, Ted Hughes. The selection process took two and in the meantime Mr. Hughes's imprimatur came through with minimal deletions of incidents relating to the couple's children. The final book wilt contain some 400 letters, almost all of them written to Mrs. Plath, plus 60 pictures, some from a scrapbook Miss Plath kept in high school. Miss Math was a prolific letter writer, averaging three or four a week, with many eight to 10 pages long, and enjoyed a close, open relationship with her mother. The letters, which span the period 1950 to 1963, the year of her death by suicide, speak freely of poetry in progress, love affairs, her married life, her fits of depression and elation. The letters have &#8220;a fantastic sense of immediacy as if you'd just ripped open the envelope,&#8221; Mrs. McCullough said.

This was followed by partnerships in other Washington law firms until he commenced his own law practice in 1991. From 1988 through 1989, he served as president of the Washington, DC Chapter of the American Friends of the Hebrew University. He founded the Alfred P. and Jane Bergner Family Scholarship at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel, making it possible annually for a college student who is a member of Washington Hebrew Congregation to spend the junior year studying at the Hebrew University. He continued to serve on the national board of the American Friends of the Hebrew University.

It cost a small fortune to give my father the funeral he always wanted, but I don't want to spend more than what's absolutely necessary on my own. What's the cheapest way to go?\\nSHIRLEY LINDEMANN\\nPendleton, N.Y. \\nA. It depends on how much posthumous guilt you're willing to take with you into eternity. If you care nothing about the feelings of your friends or family, surely the most frugal approach is to become a street person and carry no personal identification. Then, when your body is found and nobody comes to claim it at the morgue, you're almost assured a numbered grave in the potter's fields on Hart Island overlooking Long Island Sound.\\n\\nIf you're like most people, though, you will agree that the funeral isn't for the dead, but for the living. It may not matter to you, but to your friends and family, the ritual can provide closure. So live a little! It's definitely possible to arrange for a cost-conscious yet satisfying departure.\\n\\n\\"Checking out\\" can be big business -- an estimated $6 billion annually -- for the more than 45,000 Americans who operate the nation's 22,000 or so funeral homes. A moderate send-off, including funeral, flowers, limo and burial permit, can easily run $10,000 or more -- cemetery plot, opening and closing of the grave and monument considerably extra.\\n\\nFor those who have not put children through college, a funeral with all its trimmings can easily turn into the third-largest purchase -- after the house and family car.\\n\\nThe expensive bon voyage is certainly available for those who want that sort of thing -- a luxurious cast bronze coffin with a glass dome cover will set you back $85,000.\\n\\nSome funerals I've attended probably cost more than a wedding at the Plaza Hotel and were definitely crowd pleasers. When Harry Cohn, the despised Columbia Pictures studio boss, went to his final screening at Forest Lawn Memorial Park back in 1958, all the Hollywood establishment, including his most bitter enemies, showed up.\\n\\nSurveying the hordes of ill-wishers, the writer and director Billy Wilder whispered, \\"This just proves the old show-biz adage that if you give the public what it wants to see, you can always count on a big turnout.\\"\\n\\nOutside the Hollywood mogul set, lower-key final exits are in demand. Since Jessica Mitford wrote an expose called \\"The American Way of Death\\" more than 30 years ago, the Federal Trade Commission has done a credible job of cracking down on abuses in the funeral industry. A 1984 law requires funeral providers to tell clients in advance the cost of their services as well as the ones not required by state or local law.\\n\\nEven so, one must be alert. According to the National Coalition for Fair Funeral Prices, many mortuaries and predeath plans (think of it as a sort of Christmas Club without half-off shopping) overcharge by as much as $3,000 a funeral.\\n\\nThe first step is to do some planning. Bear in mind that if you don't, your family will probably spend more money from your estate to show their love and respect. The emotional trauma, time pressure and lack of information put consumers at an enormous disadvantage in making funeral arrangements, cautions the Federal Trade Commission. Whatever you decide, inform your family and relieve them of the difficult decisions about brief or perpetual care.\\n\\nCost-efficient alternatives to the big blowout and expensive cemetery plot are several. You can join a nonprofit memorial or burial society, arrange for burial at sea, select cremation or even donate your body to medical science.\\n\\nMemorial and burial societies are, in effect, buying co-operatives that trade in funerals -- instead of groceries -- in bulk. Wielding considerable buying power, such societies can be found in 175 of North America's largest markets, with most charging annual membership fees of $15 to $30. Typically, they negotiate agreements with local undertakers, specifying the desired cost and type of disposition preferred (burial, cremation).\\n\\nMemorial societies are independent of funeral homes and advise members to use caution about any prepayment plan. Regrettably, there are unscrupulous operators in every service industry, particularly those that trade on other people's misery. So if someone from a society tries to sell you something or offers a prepayment plan, investigate carefully, warns Ernest Morgan, author of \\"Dealing Creatively with Death\\" (Zinn Communications, $12.95). \\n\\nAccording to John Blake, executive director of the Funeral and Memorial Societies of America Inc., a preplanned funeral from one of these groups can save you up to 75 percent.\\n\\nIn many cases, members with simple desires -- no silk-lined coffins or symphony orchestras -- have paid less than $1,000.  \\"About 90 percent of our members,\\" Mr. Blake says, \\"opt for a cremation and memorial service rather than the more costly funeral home service and burial.\\"\\n\\nMe? I've always fancied a Viking-like send-off, complete with the flaming long boat heading into the sunset, like the one in Blake Edwards's 1981 movie, \\"S.O.B.\\" Too many weekend sailors, though, must have complained to the Coast Guard about surface clutter to keep the practice from catching on.\\n\\nStill, the Neptune Society in Medford on Long Island will take your remains and scatter them in the ocean for the low, low cost of $100.  A more formal service, on a boat out of Freeport, L.I., that accommodates 50 friends and clergy, is available for $575. Disseminations, as Neptune calls them, are usually done at the end of the month, said Joan Kiernan, a spokeswoman, \\"and the family will receive a certificate showing latitude and longitude in the Atlantic.\\"\\n\\nFor do-it-yourselfers who prowl Home Depot on the weekends, 43 states permit families to take charge of their own dead. Since this makes for a personalized and unique funeral experience, it can be meaningful for survivors as well as economical. You can even build your own coffin.\\n\\nBefore you run to the backyard and select a shady corner, check out local health regulations. You will probably find a slew of rules that make a home funeral difficult or impossible. Most towns outlaw home interment (though authorities have been known to look the other way if you're only burying an urn full of ashes).\\n\\nA charitable and cost-effective route is to deed your body to a medical school for training future doctors or to donate specific organs for transplants. The administrative and transportation cost to the family or estate is negligible","excerpt":"the benefits incalculable.\\n\\nAs of 1994, according to the American Council on Transplantation, the waiting list for available hearts, kidneys, lungs, livers, limbs, eyes and other body parts stood at over 33,000 desperate patients. Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons has produced an information packet for advance applicants and will even arrange for free pickup and delivery within a 150-mile radius of Manhattan.\\n\\nShould you leave your body to science, you must make a backup plan. While the spirit may be willing, you see, the flesh may no longer be in shape. The only exception: donating your gray matter to the Harvard Medical School for their McLean Hospital brain bank, a primary source for researchers working on Alzheimer's and various brain disorders.\\n\\nDefinitely not for penny pinchers is flash freezing the body in hopes that your body can be thawed and restored to life once a cure is developed for whatever is killing you.\\n\\nWalt Disney seriously considered such a second act but was talked out of it by the time he died of cancer in 1966. The American Cryonics Society will suspend your body in liquid nitrogen for $125,000. Budget watchers, suggests the society's president, may want to consider freezing just the brain for a mere $15,000.\\n\\nQuestions about investing, careers and personal finance can be sent to Minding Your Business, Money and Business, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York 10036.

Mr. Workman, a bassist who has performed with major modern jazz musicians since the 1960's, assembled a sextet of players with an ear for timbre. The group played extended pieces in diverse structures, among them a theme-solos-theme jazz tune, an atmospheric improvisation that very gradually coalesced into a closing melody, and an Andrew Cyrille composition, \\"5-4-3-2,\\" that sandwiched a recurring tune between duets and trios within the sextet.

The production of art is a human act we are far from understanding, and it is an act of such overdetermined meaning that we may always find it impossible to analyze fully. It has a baffling variety of causes - neurological, psychological, familial, linguistic, social, institutional, moral and epistemological. Consequently, literature can be placed, for purposes of analysis, in any number of suggestive contexts.
