As a band singer, Mr. Stallone's role model is Bobby Darin, another singer who straddled the worlds of rock and swing. Two songs in his set, \\"Mack the Knife\\" and \\"Beyond the Sea,\\" were hits for Darin three decades ago, and Mr. Stallone's clipped, jivey interpretations ape the originals not only note for note but also inflection for inflection. The only aspect of Darin's musical personality that he fails to convey is the singer's cocksure self-confidence, an attitude that concealed a multitude of inadequacies.      Although Mr. Stallone displayed an elementary rhythmic acuity at the early show last Thursday evening, his voice itself sounded small and colorless, and he demonstrated no sense of how to extend a phrase or how to read a lyric. The set's one ballad, \\"In Love in Vain,\\" was a lifeless exercise in filling time.

Such is not the case, however, in \\"The Secret Hour,\\" the Paramount Theatre's current offering, which is a sane, studied and thoroughly (dignified interpretation of Sidney Howard's prize play, \\"They Knew What They Wanted.\\" Two years ago it was reported that Will Hays frowned upon the idea of transmuting this play into a film, but since that time the Hays organization and the Author's League entered into an agreement whereby certain books and plays could be transferred to the screen with alterations, notably the changing of the title and the names of the characters. Hence, the Paramount's program makes no mention of \\"They Knew What They Wanted,\\" and only sets forth that the story of \\"The Secret Hour\\" was written by Sidney Howard.The changes in this effort have not weakened the story materially. The cheery old. Italian bootlegger becomes a respectable orange grower and, as a concession to the censorial bodies, there is more than a hint of the young persons marrying. The natures of the characters have been permitted to prevail, and Miss Negri is admirably supported by Jean Hersholt as the Italian orange grower and Kenneth Thompson as the young man.Rowland V. McKee, the director of this subject, is also responsible for the adaptation. It is an intelligent piece of work with little loss to the dramatic quality through the modifications. Seldom has a play been transferred to the screen with equal understanding and fidelity to the action. There are no extravagant stunts or tinsel, and the incidents are strikingly logical. Mr. Lee adroitly takes his time in unfurling his scenes, and consequently there is a gentle suspense and a praiseworthy absence of confusion.Perhaps some of the scenes at the outset—those in the spaghetti restaurant — might have been toned down a trifle, but when Mr. Lee introduces the orange grower, known as Luigi, he goes about his work in a more subdued fashion.Luigi is perceived in the house on his ranch, suddenly bemoaning the fact that he has no wife and no children. Later he goes to San Francisco where he see Annie (Waitress No 7) and he is tremendously impressed by her kindness and charitable conduct. On returning to his ranch he asks Jack (Mr. Thompson) to write a letter to Annie proposing marriage for him, and, after looking at himself in the mirror, he decides to put Jack's photograph in the envelope instead of his own.Then there is the sequence where Luigi takes more than a drop too much to stimulate his courage for the ordeal of greeting Annie at the railroad station. Luigi drives so recklessly that he meets with an accident, breaking both his legs. Those scenes devoted to Luigi in bed are nicely blended with pathos and humor and the subsequent dramatic interlude between Annie and Jack is filmed with sensible restraint.Miss Negri here gives as fine a performance as she has ever contributed to motion pictures. Mr. Hersholt, in an effective make-up, is most sympathetic as Luigi. Mr. Thompson, as Jack, is natural, both in his actions and in his appearance.Frank Cambria's stage number, \\"Galloping On,\\" is a creditable effort. THE SCREEN; Prize Play in Film Form.

Marcia Smith of Old Saybrook makes three kinds of mustard labeled Marcia's Mustards Made at Home. Epicurean Fantasys Magnificent Desserts Corporation is a Litchfield-based company devoted to cakes and tarts. Snydi-Idi and Company, owned by Joan Snyder of South Windsor, is known for condiments, sauces and dried soups. \\n\\nThe four fast-growing companies are among 125 producers of specialty foods that joined together under the sponsorship of the state's Department of Agriqulture more than two years ago to create the Connecticut Specialty Food and Beverage Association. Sponsoring the Food and Beverage Association was a departure from the group's original mission to market and promote crops grown in the state. But with farming in decline, state officials have turned their attention to foods being created from those crops -- tomatoes, peppers and onions turned into jars of salsa or marinara sauce, or, in government parlance, value-added crops. \\n\\nTogether, the association's member businesses have generated more than $7 million in revenue and more than 500 new jobs. \\n\\nTwenty of these entrepreneurs will be at Macy's in the Danbury Fair Mall on Tuesday, during a daylong, storewide event titled \\"Cause for Celebration,\\" which will, in part, benefit 40 nonprofit organizations. \\n\\n\\"I think it will be good exposure for us,\\" said Mrs. Snyder, a director of the association. \\"And I'm glad that some of the proceeds are going to charity. The charities are all hurting this year.\\" \\nConsignment Sales\\n\\n Mrs. Snyder, who works full time for a scientific research company, prepares her products after work and on weekends and sells them to about 50 stores in New England and California. \\n\\n\\"I take samples along wherever I go,\\" she explained, \\"even while on vacation. In California, I left a jar of my Nip 'n' Tang sauce at the hotel shop,\\" she said, referring to a fruit and horse radish condiment she has devised. \\"My husband almost died with embarrassement. But they took it and they asked for my soup as well.\\"\\n\\nIn partnership with Lisa Anderson Musumeci of Anderson Farm Herbs, Mrs. Snyder recently opened a store in the Pavilion at State House Square in downtown Hartford","excerpt":"the store is devoted to products made by members of the association. The store is run as a consignment shop, with 10 percent of the revenues going to the association. \\n\\nThe shop will provide regional experience and feedback to people who have not had a long track record in the specialty-food business, said Mrs. Musumeci, who produces herb mixtures, salad dressings and sauces inspired by her world travels. \\"For them, the association is a good safety net,\\" she said. \\n\\nIt was Beth Hillson, a food writer and author of \\"The Tasty Side of New England,\\" who pointed out that other New England states had formed specialty-food associations to assist members in their work, and Connecticut followed suit. \\nSupported With $45,000 Grant\\n\\n In 1989, the Department of Agriculture sought and received a $45,000, two-year Federal grant to form and support the association. William Hopkins, a food consultant who once owned an inn in Vermont, was hired as project coordinator. \\"My job was to get members into trade shows and fairs throughout the state, to plan meetings and seminars, publish a newsletter, do research and solve peoples' problems, such as finding the right distributor or bottle manufacturer, so they don't have to reinvent the wheel every time,\\" Mr. Hopkins said. \\"I have enjoyed it. They are a varied and interesting group of people.\\"\\n\\nThe member companies are indeed as diverse as their products, ranging from one-person enterprises like Mrs. Musumeci to family companies like Uncle Maynard's Pepper Relish -- run by the brothers Larry and Glenn Spector and their mother, Rosalie, with design assistance from a sister, Nancy -- to established food manufacturers with their own plants and dozens of employees, like Nodine's Smokehouse, which outgrew its original farm in Goshen and moved into an old Torrington knitting mill three years ago. \\nSecond Job for Some\\n\\n The businesses are scattered around the state, from Greenwich, the home of Chocolate Wicker, to Enfield, site of the Janik Sausage Company since 1899. About 65 percent of the members are full-time food manufacturers. The rest hold other jobs; Richard Abrahams, an architect from Glastonbury, for example, devotes his spare time to creating Richard's Granola and Granola Chocolate Chip Cookies. \\n\\nConsumers could plan bountiful meals around the products, with pickled quail eggs as an appetizer from the Mount Hope Valley Farm; pasta from Ravioli Kitchen of New Britain, or Stella's Pasta and Deli of Old Saybrook; frozen poultry, game or lamb from Sugar Hill Farms in Colebrook; vegetables and salads from Aux Fines Herbes in Bolton and myriad desserts from Warner Cheesecake Company of South Windsor, Sweet Maria's of Waterbury or Salem Valley Farms ice cream. \\n\\nWith dinner, a connoisseur might select wine from Stonington Vineyards, mineral water from Village Springs Corporation of West Willington, coffee from Daybreak Coffee Roaster in Glastonbury, tea from Harney and Sons in Salisbury, or herbal tea from Sundial Herb Garden in Higganum. \\n\\nJams, jellies, condiments and sauces abound, as do snacks, including UConn Huskies Tortilla Chips, named for the school's basketball team. \\n\\nMany entrepreneurs began with recipes from home. Nadia Cotter, who makes pita chips in various flavors, named her company Sittoo's Gourmet Products, after the word for grandmother in Lebanese, whereas Joan Snyder's bean 'n' beer soup was inspired by her uncle, a brewer who liked to cook with beer. \\nEven Adversity Creates a Business\\n\\n Other producers transformed hobbies into careers. Tony Norris and Mike Kandefer were gardeners who grew more vegetables, herbs and salad greens than they could eat. They started selling their excess produce to a market, then to upscale grocery stores, caterers and restaurants, and soon their company, Aux Fines Herbes, became a full-time venture. \\n\\nEven adversity can sometimes create a business. DaSilva Klanko, the Waterbury-based makers of Love 'n' Herbs salad dressings, resulted from Peter Klanko's heart attack. Maria Klanko devised her no-salt dressing when her husband was told he would have to change his diet. \\n\\nThe grants that supported the association expired in August, but the coordinator who is still with the Department of Agriculture, remains involved. \\n\\n\\"It's been fun and rewarding to look for avenues for them, to see them grow,\\" Mr. Hopkins said. \\"The grant's purpose was to make the association self-sufficient at the end of two years, and it is. \\n\\n\\"They're off and running on their own now.\\" \\n\\n\\nTickets for \\"Cause for Celebration\\" at the Danbury Fair Mall, priced at $5 each, will be sold at the door. Entertainment, fashion shows and prizes will add to the program in which the state's specialty-food producers will offer samples and demonstrations of their products, which will be available for sale.

In the history of modern fiction, J. F. Powers (1917-99) was a distinctive figure, a loner, emerging from quietness every few years when he published a book or won a prize, but otherwise content to mind his own professional business. He is sometimes described as a writer's writer, meaning that he was an artist too good to gratify the most casual reader, but he was also a reader's writer, if we assume a reader who thinks of fiction as intelligent art rather than low entertainment. Such writers tend not to be abundant. Powers published only a few books -- three collections of short stories, ''Prince of Darkness, and Other Stories'' (1947), ''The Presence of Grace'' (1956) and ''Look How the Fish Live'' (1975), and two novels, ''Morte D'Urban'' (1962) and ''Wheat That Springeth Green'' (1988). But these are treasured, guarded with jealousy by those who know of them. News of their quality is passed from one adept to another, like word of an idyllic village in an unfashionable part of France, not to be disclosed to the ordinary camera-toting tourist. Now that Powers is dead, he has become his admirers, as Auden said of Yeats.\\n\\n I met Powers only once. He and his wife and children lived for several years in Ireland, in a small seaside town called Greystones, about 17 miles south of Dublin. (It is clearly the Ballydoo of his story ''Tinkers.'') He rarely left the town, even to sample the joys of Dublin. But he became friends with Sean O'Faolain, who lived a few miles away in an even more salubrious place, Killiney. I lived in Mount Merrion, a suburb on the south side of Dublin. My social life was meager, so I accepted with enthusiasm an invitation from O'Faolain to come to lunch in Killiney.

The action is explained by the projection of occasional summaries in English.One of the most engaging incidents is when the young Countess Maria, in downhearted retirement at her parents' country estate after having been the innocent cause of a duel at Weimar where she was studying with the master, learns that Liszt wants her to be the soloist at the concert to be given in Budapest on the occasion of his fiftieth birthday.Her sadness leaves her","excerpt":"the strains of the Second Hungarian Rhapsody are heard in the distance; the music grows louder and more impetuous until the entire population of the place participates in the finale.

Probably not, unless you are old enough to remember that the Metropolitan Opera produced his ''The Emperor Jones'' in 1933 or unless you happen to have collected every recording ever made by Jascha Heifetz, who commissioned and introduced his Violin Concerto almost 40 years ago.  Gruenberg, once one of the big names in American music, slipped into obscurity long before his death in 1964, an obscurity that the American Composers Orchestra may penetrate a bit on Wednesday evening when his ''The Daniel Jazz'' is performed at the Symphony Space on a program that also includes works by Jeffrey Mumford, Daniel Perlongo, Brian Fennelly and Wallingford Riegger.   Gruenberg represents the composer who enjoys dazzling early success, flourishes for many years and then drops out of sight, often inexplicably. Not only his music but his very name fades away. Even footnote writers lose track of him. The mystery only deepens if we directly compare the music left by some fairly well-known composers with that by these forgotten composers. Quality does not invariably determine whose fame lives on. A devoted and tireless propagandist, usually a widow, can insure that a composer's name, if not his actual music, will survive in the history books.

However, Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich has asserted that the results will be illegitimate and vowed to challenge them in court. Demonstrations could prolong the dispute even further.   A1    Attack in Honduras Kills 28  Gunmen claiming to be members of a long-silent revolutionary movement, the Cinchoneros, opened fire on a city bus in Honduras, killing 28 people, including 4 children, who were on their way home from work and last-minute Christmas shopping. The group blamed the government's anticrime campaigns for the attack and warned of more bloodshed.   A4    Strong Showing from Hamas  The militant group Hamas made a surprisingly strong showing in local Palestinian elections, according to preliminary results, signaling a drop in popularity for the ruling Fatah movement ahead of next month's presidential poll. The results could indicate faltering support for the interim Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas.   A5    Israeli Scientist Detained  Mordechai Vanunu, the Israeli nuclear technician who spent 18 years in prison for disclosing that his government had nuclear weapons, was detained as he tried to enter the West Bank city of Bethlehem for Christmas in defiance of restrictions imposed after his release.   A5    Rumsfeld Visits Iraq Troops  Iraq ''looks bleak'' and is a ''tough situation,'' but there is no question the United States will prevail, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told troops on a Christmas Eve visit to several hostile Iraqi regions. Meanwhile, insurgent violence continued, as one person was killed and 19 were wounded when a fuel tanker exploded in Baghdad.   A8    Baghdad's Christians, estimated at 10 percent of the city's population, have been besieged by bombs, mortars and gunfire over the last year. This Christmas, even more than last year's, their celebrations are subdued and severely curtailed. Many Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and other Christian churches are holding no large services at all.   A8    Tariq Aziz, a jailed former senior aide to Saddam Hussein, rejected reports that he will testify against the former dictator. Mr. Aziz also denied there was any corruption in the United Nations-run oil-for-food program.   A10    Contrack International Inc., which became the first major American company to withdraw from Iraq reconstruction work because of violence, was awarded a $63.9 million Army construction contract in Afghanistan. The new contract covers the design and construction of regional brigade facilities for the Afghan Army.   A10    NATIONAL   A14-24    New Instant-Check System Delivers Quick Impact  The impact of a new electronic instant-check system for gun licenses and gun purchases in Massachusetts has become quickly apparent. The system makes it easier and faster for the police to track firearms and for gun dealers to learn if a person can legally own a firearm.   A14    In Midwest, Cold After Storm  Much of the Midwest spent time digging out from a storm that left motorists stranded, airports snarled, power lines down and Christmas deliveries delayed. About 300,000 people were without power in Ohio and Kentucky.   A14    Order Settles Abuse Lawsuits  The Christian Brothers, a Roman Catholic religious order, agreed to pay $6.3 million to settle lawsuits brought by three former students who were sexually abused at an elite boys school in Northern California, the plaintiffs' lawyers and a victims' advocacy group said.   A17    Whistle-Blowers Not Protected  Some federal researchers and medical experts do not enjoy the same protections to blow the whistle on wrongdoing as other civil servants, a judge has ruled.   A15    Wages Don't Pay the Rent  In only 4 of the nation's 3,066 counties can someone working full-time and earning federal minimum wage afford to pay rent and utilities on a one-bedroom apartment, an advocacy group on low-income housing has reported.   A21    South Erases Reminders  The South is slowly erasing reminders of its Civil War past for fear of offending tourists and scaring off business, from renaming Confederate Boulevard in Arkansas to shrinking ''Heart of Dixie'' on Alabama's license plates.   A24    Concern Over Amendments  Civil libertarians are upset about a string of new constitutional amendments in Hawaii that undo several state court rulings protecting the rights of sex offenders.   A19    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Spitzer Would Cede Cases To Federal Government  After nearly three years of high-profile prosecutions of investment banks, mutual funds and insurance companies, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York says that he is ready to cede those investigations to federal regulators.   A1    L.I.R.R. Ride Deal Cited  Conductors on the Long Island Rail Road allowed employees of Madison Square Garden to ride without paying, and in return workers at the arena gave employees of the commuter railroad free admission to events, the inspector general for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has found.

Thus it is hard to make Cal Ripken, the Orioles' shortstop, interesting, and therefore it's surely a waste of time to read about him.

The most recent instance of this was the decision of Judge Thomas P. Griesa in Federal District Court in Manhattan late last month that blocks, for the time being, all Federal funds for New York City's Westway project.   Included in Judge Griesa's decision was the observation that state and Federal agencies had conspired to distort the findings of a study completed in 1980. The study found that the area of the Hudson that would be lost to Westway landfill was a significant striped bass habitat. The landfill would add 165 acres to the city and involves the entire inter-pier area. The Westway - estimates of its cost have ranged from nearly $2 billion to $4 billion - would run for 4.2 miles from the Battery to 42d Street.   The Sierra Club is the lead plaintiff in the Westway case. Neil Goldstein of the organization's Manhattan office says that the most blatant violation of the law involves striped bass. But, he adds, ''We also believe that the project's proponents violated several of the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act.''

CALENDAR"},{"year":"1994","title":"Watching Orlando's Lucky 4,000    The big question for a promising technology is when, if ever, will it become more than a concept or a market-test. The crossover -- when technological potential becomes market phenomenon -- is what experts call an \\"inflection point\\" or (dare we use the term?) a \\"paradigm shift.\\" The much-heralded information superhighway could be one. The project to watch begins in April in Orlando, led by Time Warner Entertainment. It will bring information technology and state-of-the-art entertainment -- such things as video-on-demand -- into 4,000 homes. Odds are that much of the reporting and commentary about it will be skeptical in tone, poking a hole in the digital balloon. But such a dose of questioning could be healthy, while not weeding out any serious new-media players. By Steve Lohr. C11  TV's Behind-the Screen Scramble    Forget the 500 channels hype. Barry Diller, right, who spent most of the year trying to acquire Paramount, considers the notion mostly whimsy. For some time to come viewers will watch television pretty much as always -- specific programs on specific channels, available at specific times. What will change will be relationships between program producers and distributors. Paramount and Warner Brothers each want to create new networks because they expect CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox to produce more of their own programs and buy less from the studios. One result: more news-magazine programs as a hedge against a shortage of entertainment programming. By Bill Carter. C11  That's Patented?     Computer software publishers were stunned when Compton's New Media received a patent for an information search technique used in multi-media databases. Published on compact disks, the databases provide information by combining text, color pictures, sound, animation and video on computer screens. Publishers are dismayed that the Government granted Compton's a virtual stranglehold.

Douglass, a prominent black American of the 19th century, funneled his power through oratory, and oratory is in large part the essence of Italian dramatic style.

The view to the grave stretches before them as an uninterrupted, monochromatic corridor.  And Al, who has taken up painting since losing his job, finds that no matter how hard he tries, he always creates the same picture: a gray-toned landscape showing a tree and a factory.

And not the modern studio, either","excerpt":"the studio in which silent films were made with all the falsities of artificial lighting, flimsy stage sets and powdered-gypsum snow.More than that, it is photographed in color that has such a harsh, unnatural look that it smacks more of advertising posters than of reproduced reality, and it ends in a splurge of propaganda that is so corny it's laughable.I can't recall another instance in which a fine director has so radically and disasterously changed his style.The switch is apparent at the outset when Chukhrai brings us in on a family's New Year's Eve celebration in 1938. The occasion is lusciously romantic: an older sister is announcing her engagement and a younger one is dissolving in a starry-eyed case of love at first sight for a handsome Red Army flyer who happens by. The color is practically garish, the musical background is lush and the mood is as sentimental as that of a musical comedy.Now the director propels us to a schoolroom; it is 1941 and little sister is mooning over her schoolbook with a callow, flirtatious boy. She still remembers that flyer, with a far-away look in her eyes.Then—pow!—a messenger comes racing in to announce that war has begun. Feet go rushing in all directions, like in \\"Ten Days That Shook the World.\\" Sister's husband goes off to the army, and word comes later that he's been killed. Papa is soon enlisted and little sister is left all alone.One night, in an air-raid shelter that looks like the Blue Grotto of Capri, she encounters the heroic flyer, and this leads to — well, you can guess, if you've ever seen one of those antique war romances from Hollywood. Little sister, enraptured, gets pregnant; she bears the hero's child and then she is left to raise the baby when the hero is reported missing and does not return.But he does return, years later — and now the propaganda pitch comes in: a Stalinist party committee refuses to reinstate him to party membership. It seems that he has been falsely dishonored for technical reasons beyond his control. So he becomes a drunkard and things look awfully bleak — until Stalin dies, the snows melt, the pack ice thaws in the rivers, the skies clear and a new party committee gives him a hero's honor, the gold star.That is the nature of this picture. It is maudlin and old-fashioned beyond belief, and it is played in a lush, romantic fashion by Nina Drobysheva and Yevgeny Urbansky, who are appropriately pretty, at least. Poetry, truthfulness, simplicity, even the traditional Soviet documentary slant have been surrendered by Mr. Chukhrai to an onslaught of synthetic emotionalism that is hard to explain.I can't imagine what happened to him, but the fact that his picture took first prize at the Moscow Film Festival in 1961 may be significant.

According to Karen Grant of the industry tracking company NPD, 46 percent of the premium perfumes (those over $75) sold in 2008 were designer brands. Celebrity perfumes were 1 percent. In other words, if you had money and, presumably, taste, you didn’t buy them. As art — creativity, quality, legitimacy — their reputations are abysmal. Perhaps this is because Jennifer Lopez and Celine Dion have perfumes but Cate Blanchett and Helen Mirren do not. That reason may be that Lopez has a strongly self-associating demographic eager to monetize her celebrity, whereas Mirren focuses on acting. It may also be that much of celebrity perfumery is unadulterated garbage. What is fascinating about Antonio Banderas Blue Seduction for Women, to take one example, is that it makes no difference if one is responsive to or conscious of sensory impressions: the thing doesn’t leave any. Or, rather, it gives 60 seconds of vaguely pleasant sugar water and then … signal lost. The perfumer Olivier Cresp built two of the greatest perfumes of the turn of the 21st century, Angel and Light Blue. I can’t begin to imagine what Cresp — to whom this thing is credited, along with, in good Hollywood create-by-committee style, Antonio Puig, Elisabeth Vidal and Rosendo Mateu — did on, to, with or for this project. The only scenario I can imagine is that the licensee gave such a miserably low cost per kilo for raw materials that they were obligated to throw in the cheapest materials around. This scent wouldn’t be used in a Walgreens generic body wash. This is why the exceptions to the rule are so striking. Elizabeth Arden’s creative team hired the talented perfumer Caroline Sabas to do Midnight Fantasy for Britney Spears, gave her money for the juice and let her do some serious work. The result is both a perfect olfactory incarnation of Spears (on the screen, not behind the wheel of a car) and a chef d’oeuvre of the new neon sweets/ultra-gourmand category.

Good quality kilims are still being produced, but it is mostly foreigners who buy them, and rugs can't tell us much about the style of contemporary Istanbul.\\n\\n A style only becomes identifiable when it becomes self-aware, and something to aspire to. All it takes is a few cafes and bars where like-minded people can sit and talk and listen to the same music, and feel that they are -- well -- onto something, even if they aren't sure precisely what it is. In the last five or six years all of these factors have come together in a small, central district of Istanbul, which, for purposes of simplicity, I will call the Tunel. This name, which derives from the fact that the district is home to the world's shortest subway line, covers many diverse quarters with difficult names. It forms part of the Ottoman European quarter of Pera-Galata, and stands on a steep hill overlooking the Golden Horn and the old city. For decades it suffered from decline and neglect as the original, polyglot population, consisting mostly of Greeks and Jews, began to drift away, and was replaced by poor, rural migrants. It was no longer a place where the middle class wanted to live. As a result, it entered the 90's with the vast majority of its splendid Beaux-Arts and Art Nouveau apartment buildings intact, at which point it began to benefit from the growing cultural maturity of republican Turkey, a maturity that involved a certain disenchantment with modernity. One fin de siècle was joined to another. Why live in a banal box miles from the city's historic center when you could rent or buy an authentic late-Ottoman apartment with stuccoed ceilings and the projecting window bays known as cumbas, whose origins can be traced back to Byzantine times?

Cory, who is a heavy reader and would-be author, remains standoffish until she notices that her counselor is staring at her. It takes no leap of the imagination to diagnose the reason for the counselor's interest. In Barbara Graham's \\"Camp Paradox,\\" the footlockers are crammed with detritus from adolescent fiction. In the course of the play (at the WPA Theater), Cory comes of age in the summer of 1963 and has her first sexual experience while saying things like \\"I was a trespasser on foreign soil without a map.\\"   The play's one claim to distinction, or at least to difference, is that Cory's initial liaison is not with a boy in a neighboring camp but with that counselor, a 28-year-old lesbian still sulking after an aborted romance with a woman during her college days. Except for the older woman's unhappiness, it is difficult to see what draws her into an affair with the young girl, with whom she apparently has nothing in common.

The sniper, though, was under orders not to kill the Palestinian leader, because Israel felt that the world fallout would be too great -- so he snapped a picture of Mr. Arafat instead. Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was defense minister at the time. Nineteen years later Mr. Sharon and Mr. Arafat are again stalking each other. It looks like much has changed since that wild summer of '82. But don't be fooled. These two old warriors once again have each other in their gun sights. Mr. Sharon still views Mr. Arafat as a lying terrorist out to destroy Israel, and Mr. Arafat still views Mr. Sharon as a brutal thug out to destroy Palestinian nationalism. They would each like to finish what they started in 1982 by eliminating the other politically.    But what is striking about their rematch is how differently the two men approach it. Mr. Sharon has forgotten nothing about Mr. Arafat, but he has learned something from his mistakes back in the summer of '82. Mr. Arafat has forgotten nothing about Mr. Sharon, but he has learned nothing from his mistakes in the summer of '82. How so? Mr. Sharon believes that he was defeated in Lebanon, not by the Palestinians, but by the left and center of the Israeli public, who turned against the war with massive street demonstrations -- making it impossible for him to finish off Mr. Arafat and the P.L.O. -- and by the U.S. and the world, who turned against the war after the Beirut massacres -- making it impossible for Mr. Sharon to reshape Lebanon.

When we quarreled over the network's coverage of the Vietnam hearings in 1966, I quit. I now find myself celebrating those 16 years when I worked for him in his news division.    One special memory: In 1963, I asked to see Paley in his 20th-floor office. My mission was to remind him that the 20th anniversary of D-Day was only a year away. I suggested he call his wartime friend Gen. Dwight Eisenhower and invite him to accompany Walter Cronkite and the \\"CBS Report's\\" team back to the Normandy beaches of World War II. We would spend 10 days in Normandy to produce a 90-minute program, \\"D-Day Plus 20 Years.\\"    Two minutes later, Paley was on the phone selling the idea to the former President. He concluded our conversation with the instructions, \\"Fred, you've got a date with Ike tomorrow morning in Gettysburg.\\"    Later, when I told Paley we had a Normandy deal, he told me with glee that he would join the production force of what we called the \\"Eisenhower Irregulars.\\" Ike's only condition was that we go by water because \\"Mamie just won't fly.\\" That July we all sailed on the old Queen Elizabeth.

Based on historical fact, José Rivera's new play is about two days that Che Guevera spent trapped in a one-room schoolhouse. A co-production with the Labyrinth Theater company. John Ortiz and Patricia Velasquez star. (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200.    'SUMMER PLAY FESTIVAL' Starts Wednesday. Through July 30. Fifteen emerging playwrights, including Peter Morris and Etan Frankel, strut their stuff in this eclectic annual showcase. Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.    Broadway    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, Special Theatrical Event 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, Best Play and Best Direction of a Play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)    'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, Best Direction of a Musical 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'BURLEIGH GRIME$' A feeble-witted comedy by Roger Kirby about dirty dealings on Wall Street, featuring a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work -- Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives'' -- and incidental music by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor. (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE BUSY WORLD IS HUSHED' With the Episcopal church in a tizzy about homosexuality and that intriguing new gospel of Judas the subject of much speculation, Keith Bunin's play about conflicts of family and of faith arrives at a propitious moment. Jill Clayburgh stars as an Episcopal minister with a troublesome son and what may be an undiscovered Gospel. Engaging, if a little too tidy (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'THE FIELD'  John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will and Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231.(George Hunka)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)    'THE WATER'S EDGE' In a bold surgical endeavor that recalls the experiments of the mad Dr. Frankenstein, Theresa Rebeck has tried to transplant the big, blood-engorged heart of a Greek tragedy into the slender body of a modest American comic drama. The resulting hybrid runs amok in a stylishly acted production, directed by Will Frears and starring Kate Burton and Tony Goldwyn (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ARABIAN NIGHT' A blonde in a German apartment building sleeps too much","excerpt":"the super takes an unexpected trip to the desert; and a peeping Tom is properly punished in this stylish comedy whose title turns out to make perfect sense (1:05). The East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Gates)    'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright, Yussef El Guindi, addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after Sept. 11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16; closes on Sunday. (Hunka)    'ELVIS AND JULIET'  This opposites-collide tale by Mary Willard and starring her husband, the television actor Fred Willard, looks like community theater and is just as unoriginal. The title characters are young lovers, he the son of an Elvis impersonator, she the daughter of overeducated snobs. Fred dons an Elvis suit, but it's not enough (2:15). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'GETTING HOME' Anton Dudley's Valentine's Day card to New York, in which three lonely lovers finally find love in unexpected places, directed by David Schweizer. Determinedly angst-free (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422; closes tomorrow. (Hunka)    'THE GOLD STANDARD' A successful alumnus, his trophy girlfriend and an eccentric Korean professor form a romantic triangle at a campus bar in Daniel Roberts's drama, which is occasionally original but often downright odd (2:30). The Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Gates)    'THE HOUSE IN TOWN'  A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)    * 'THE MOST WONDERFUL LOVE' Blue Coyote Theater Group has a rollicking good time with this inventive tale of domestic disintegration by Matthew Freeman. Mother (Lenni Benicaso) and Father (Frank Anderson), after long years together, decide to ''unmarry,'' which isn't quite the same as divorce but just as unsettling for their already unsettled youngest child (Josephine Stewart). But that doesn't begin to convey how nutty this play is. Access Theater, 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'NERVE' In Adam Szymkowicz's romantic comedy, an online couple's first date is a frightening but satisfyingly comic escalation of confessions and demands (1:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow.(Gates)    'NOTHING' A morsel of catnip for Anglophiles, flavorfully adapted by Andrea Hart from the novel by Henry Green. Simon Dutton and Sophie Ward play onetime lovers contemplating the possible marriage of their children in this comedy of manners about the string of upheavals that a romance in one generation causes in another (1:40). The 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'SATELLITES' This tough-minded, soft-hearted and very likable play by Diana Son (''Stop Kiss'') portrays a world in which traditional ethnic, social, economic and sexual boundaries have become so porous that people are never quite sure who or where they are. Sandra Oh and Kevin Carroll play a couple who move into a Brooklyn brownstone that refuses (literally) to stay still. Michael Greif directs the appropriately fluid ensemble. (1:40). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)    'STOPPING TRAFFIC' The actress Mary Pat Gleason's endearing one-woman show about making movies (and just getting through life) while bipolar is a play with both a message and some hearty laughs (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303; closes on Sunday. (Gates)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)    * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)    'THE BLOOD OF MY BROTHER' (No rating, 84 minutes, in English and Arabic) Another documentary about the occupation of Iraq; another heartbreak; another protest; another dead brother; another necessity. (Nathan Lee)    'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)    'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)    * 'CAVITE' (No rating, 80 minutes, in English and Tagalog) Terrorism and cultural identity are only two of the themes wound into a tight knot of fear and bewilderment in this gripping, no-budget political thriller shot on the fly with hand-held cameras that scour the teeming streets and squatter shacks of Cavite, a city on the outskirts of Manila. (Stephen Holden)  'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)    * 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet, and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright, and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden)     'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)    'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee)    * 'GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS'  (No rating, 103 minutes) Affected but elegant, this digital video ''Death in Venice'' follows an art historian and her lover as they grapple, frequently in the buff, with life, death and the iconography of Bosch. (Lee)    'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES'  (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)    'THE HIDDEN BLADE' (R, 132 minutes, in Japanese) Set in 1861 at the tail end of Japanese feudalism, ''The Hidden Blade'' focuses on a gentle samurai balancing his love for a low-caste servant girl and his mission to kill a traitorous friend. By taking samurai-movie conventions and placing them in the harsh light of daily survival, the director, Yoji Yamada, is illuminating the twilight of an entire way of life. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)    'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh uses clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael García Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis)    'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)    'LAND OF THE BLIND' (R, 111 minutes) Watching this simplistic Orwellian fable set in a composite Everycountry that swings politically from extreme right to extreme left is like poring over a quadruple exposure. It's a jumble of ideas and images. (Holden)     'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden)    'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)    * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)    * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)    'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden)    'ONLY HUMAN' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Spanish) When a Jewish girl takes her Palestinian fiancé home to meet the parents, the encounter sets off a series of zany, romantic and potentially tragic misadventures during one eventful night in Madrid. (Laura Kern)    'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)    * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)    * 'ROOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) Engulfed by nightmares, blackouts and the anxieties of the age, a Texas woman flees homeland insecurity for a New York vision quest in this acute, resourceful and bracingly ambitious debut film. (Lee)    'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)    'SAY UNCLE' (R, 90 minutes) A comedy about a suspected gay pedophile is something even Mel Brooks might balk at, but ''Say Uncle'' would have benefited from his ability to turn bad taste into a good feature. When a childlike artist (Peter Paige, who also writes and directs) indulges his unhealthy, if innocent, interest in other people's children, a lynch mob of local moms is formed to hunt him down. Aspiring to address gay persecution and social paranoia, the movie mostly comes off as a study of arrested development. (Catsoulis)    'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)    * 'TWO DRIFTERS' (No rating, 98 minutes, in Portuguese) From the dexterous mind of João Pedro Rodrigues comes a bizarre love triangle like no other. Two gay boys (one of whom is dead) are reunited with the help of an enigmatic girl on roller skates in a metaphysical melodrama about grief, love, hysterical pregnancy and the transmigration of souls. (Lee)    'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)    'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden)    * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis)    'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)    Film Series    AFRO-PUNK WEEKEND (Through Tuesday) BAMcinématek's second annual program of films about revolution begins today. Films to be screened include Sandra Dickson and Churchill Roberts's ''Negroes With Guns'' (2004), the story of Robert Williams, a founder of the Black Panthers and advocate of armed resistance; ''Paris Is Burning'' (1990), Jennie Livingston's portrait of drag queens and self-invention; and ''Punk: Attitude'' (2005), a documentary about the origins of punk from Don Letts, co-founder of the band Big Audio Dynamite. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    ESSENTIAL WILDER (Through July 20) Film Forum's three-week retrospective of the work of the great Polish-born director and screenwriter Billy Wilder (1906-2002) begins today and tomorrow with ''Double Indemnity'' (1944), Wilder's noir classic about an insurance salesman (Fred McMurray) and an alluring married woman (Barbara Stanwyck), who hatch a murder plot with a big payoff. Sunday's feature is the comedy masterpiece ''Some Like It Hot'' (1959), about an all-women band that includes Marilyn Monroe and, strangely enough, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-9110; $10. (Gates)    STANLEY KUBRICK RETROSPECTIVE (Through July 9) The Museum of the Moving Image's five-week series continues this weekend with ''A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), starring Malcolm McDowell as a young, violent type from the near future, and ''Barry Lyndon'' (1975), Kubrick's Thackeray adaptation starring Ryan O'Neal as an 18th-century Irish social climber. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates)    KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues Sunday and Tuesday with ''Yojimbo'' (1961), starring Toshiro Mifune as a 19th-century samurai drifter who manipulates two rival gangsters. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates)    NEW YORK ASIAN FILM FESTIVAL (Through tomorrow) Subway Cinema's fifth annual festival of high-grossing and/or award-winning new movies concludes tomorrow at the ImaginAsian Theater. The final films include ''Beetle the Horn King'' (2005), a Japanese sci-fi movie about Mexican wrestlers, and ''Linda Linda Linda'' (2005), the story of Japanese high school girls (and one Korean) who form a band. 239 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 371-6682; $9. (Gates)    NORDIC NOIR: CRIME DRAMAS FROM SWEDEN AND DENMARK  (Through Aug. 10) The American Scandinavian Foundation is screening ''Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander Mysteries,'' television films written by Mr. Mankell, the author of the internationally best-selling Wallander novels. In ''Mastermind,'' to be shown Wednesday and Thursday, a criminal has infiltrated the detective's hometown police station. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * BELLE AND SEBASTIAN (Tuesday) For a decade now, these members of Scottish indie royalty have made some of the most tasteful chamber pop on the planet: calm and elegant and clever, though sometimes a little bloodless. But the band loosened up a bit for its latest, ''The Life Pursuit'' (Matador), adding some bluesy vamps and -- could it be? -- some rock 'n' roll. At 3:30 p.m., the Lawn at Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free, but tickets are required. (Ben Sisario)    KURTIS BLOW (Thursday) The City Parks Foundation's series of free concerts in parks throughout the five boroughs begins in Brooklyn with Kurtis Blow, who became one of the first heroes of rap with strutting and innocently street-smart rhymes like ''The Breaks'' (''Brakes on a bus, brakes on a car/ Breaks to make you a superstar''). At 7 p.m., Von King Park, Marcy and Tompkins Avenues, Bedford-Stuyvesant, (212) 360-8290; free. (Sisario)    BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE (Thursday) This Toronto collective has mastered a kind of free-associative indie-prog, following melodies and rhythmic patterns along endlessly fascinating tangents. The band plays a benefit concert for the Celebrate Brooklyn series, with the Hidden Cameras, another inventive and well-populated Toronto band. At 6 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 855-7882 or (866) 468-7619; $30. (Sisario)    JOHNNY DOWD; MARY LORSON AND SAINT LOW (Thursday) Johnny Dowd applies his stoic Texas twang to songs about passion, sin and death; his band plays a version of honky-tonk that sounds as if it has been dragged through a swamp and encrusted with misfiring electronics. Mary Lorson, who was at the core of the band Madder Rose, has a pensive undertow behind her airy voice, floating in tunes that blend a folky delicacy with the lilt of jazz. Fans of Suzanne Vega or Mazzy Star owe it to themselves to discover her. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $12. (Jon Pareles)    FUTUREHEADS (Tonight) The Futureheads, from the northern English city of Sunderland, play tight, nervy and exhilarating little tantrums of guitar, with four-part chants and an endless supply of clever riffs. The band's first album, released two years ago, was one of the best by the many recent bands to resuscitate the angular postpunk of Gang of Four and Wire, and its new one, ''News and Tributes'' (Star Time/Vagrant), shows that it was no accident. With the French Kicks. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $22 in advance, $24 at the door. (Sisario)    GIPSY KINGS (Thursday) Strumming half a dozen guitars, singing in a husky rasp and stamping their heels on the floor, the members of this French pop group are to flamenco what Rice-a-Roni is to paella. Which is not to say that some of their international hits, like ''Bamboleo,'' aren't fiendishly catchy. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888)466-5722; $31.50 to $81.50. (Pareles)    * JOSÉ GONZÁLEZ, JUANA MOLINA, PSAPP (Monday) Connoisseurs of hip television soundtracks might recognize some of the music on this bill. José González, an Argentinean Swede, plays haunting, austere confessions with precision guitar picking and a deadpan hush; his song ''Crosses'' was played in the soap-opera season finale of ''The OC'' this spring. Juana Molina is another whispery Argentine, whose gentle, swirling lullabies draw a listener directly into her reveries. The English duo Psapp places soft vocals over beats constructed from found sounds like splashing water, creaking floorboards and even squeaking cats, creating a kind of hyperintimate electronica; ''Grey's Anatomy'' uses one of Psapp's songs as its theme. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sisario)    JOE JACKSON (Tonight) In songs like ''Is She Really Going Out With Him?'' and ''Steppin' Out'' in the late 1970's and early 80's, Joe Jackson made his reputation as a cold-eyed master of British soul, bringing a cutting new-wave minimalism to stories of lonely lovers who cry that they are ''so tired of all the darkness in our lives.'' Since then he has proved remarkably versatile, releasing, among other projects, settings of the Seven Deadly Sins and a Grammy-winning recording of his Symphony No. 1. At 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; sold out. (Sisario)    * SALIF KEITA (Tonight) Salif Keita, from Mali, has long been celebrated for a cosmopolitan ear and a voice that can melt hearts, but lately, with a devotion to acoustic guitars, his work has been even more entrancing than usual. His new album, ''M'Bemba'' (Decca), has songs of love and tribute to ancestors, its guitars joined by instruments from Hawaii, the Caribbean and even medieval Europe. At 8, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; $39 and $49. (Sisario)    ANGÉLIQUE KIDJO, VUSI MAHLASELA (Tomorrow) Angélique Kidjo, from Benin, has a raw, gutsy voice, charisma that lights up a stage, and the determination to reach the world. Vusi Mahlasela was one of the most important songwriters of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, not just for his political courage but also for his sterling voice and for three-chord rockers that make earnest sentiments bounce. At 7 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Pareles)    BAABA MAAL (Sunday) Baaba Maal, one of the great singers and bandleaders from Senegal, merges the incantatory vocals and twinkling guitar lines of griot songs with elements of rock, reggae and Afro-Cuban music. His fusions embrace the world without leaving Senegal behind. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $34 in advance, $38 at the door. (Pareles)    * MADONNA (Sunday and Monday) Part 10 (or so), in which our heroine strikes such poses as Jesus on the cross, James Brown in his cape and John Travolta in his white disco suit, all while performing dance-floor hits in new remixes and reconfigurations. Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $354.50 . (Sisario)    MATES OF STATE (Thursday) Most of the time Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel, the married couple who make up Mates of State, sing insistent, almost nagging chants propelled by quick-pulse organ and drums; their latest, ''Bring It Back'' (Barsuk), also has some soothing, affectionate piano songs. At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789. Free; tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Sisario)    MIDSUMMER NIGHT SWING (Tonight through Thursday) Lincoln Center's annual outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing continues tonight with western swing by the Bob Wills's Texas Playboys (who have continued since Wills's death 21 years ago); tomorrow features salsa with Alex Torres y Su Orquesta, a 13-piece band; on Tuesday, Jo Thompson sings swing favorites with the J. C. Heard Orchestra; Beth Mead's Big Bandjo, on Wednesday, plays -- can you guess? -- classic swing songs in banjo-led arrangements; and Thursday features plena, the traditional Puerto Rican form of singing, dancing and social commentary, with Plena Libre. At 7:30 p.m., with dance lessons at 6:30 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza, Columbus Avenue at 63rd Street, (212) 875-5460; $15 each night. (Sisario)    AMY RIGBY, ROBBIE FULKS (Tonight) After years in various New York country-rock groups, Amy Rigby emerged on her own. She has made six worthy albums of succinct, tuneful songs about struggling through adulthood, when jobs, romance and motherhood aren't exactly what she'd hoped for. Robbie Fulks is fond of honky-tonk and the Beatles, and he comes up with tuneful, neatly phrased songs about near-psychotic characters. At 7 p.m., South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Pareles)    * TV ON THE RADIO, MATT POND PA (Tonight) One of Brooklyn's finest and most consistently intriguing bands, TV on the Radio casts a dark and seductive spell with swirling electronics, washes of Pixies-esque guitar and, most alluringly, vocals that draw from both early Peter Gabriel and doo-wop. The band has a fantastic and long-awaited new album, ''Return to Cookie Mountain,'' which is due to be released by Interscope Records later this year. Matt Pond PA adds some interesting colors to its indie-rock songs with touches of cello and strings. At 6:30, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario)    RHONDA VINCENT (Wednesday) Rhonda Vincent sings, plays mandolin and pushes bluegrass in some modern directions without forgetting standards like ''Muleskinner Blues.'' At 7 p.m., Madison Square Park, Madison Avenue and 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 538-6667; free. (Pareles)    WALKMEN (Tonight) The Walkmen emerged five years ago, playing exquisitely articulated songs of exhaustion and disaffection, with Hamilton Leithauser's weary whine surrounded by an echoey wash of guitar and keyboards. The band's new album, ''A Hundred Miles Off'' (Record Collection), begins intriguingly, with festive Mexican horns, but pretty soon it's back to the familiar guitar-bleached anguish. At 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $17.50. (Sisario)    GARY WILSON AND THE BLIND DATES (Wednesday) The point is often made that not all the bands at CBGB in the late 1970's sounded like the Ramones. But perhaps no one was less like the Ramones than Gary Wilson, who played a kind of shattered lounge music with angst-ridden, unhinged vocals. (He also sometimes wrapped his face in plastic and wore two sets of sunglasses, something that might have actually looked cool on Joey Ramone.) Mr. Wilson disappeared from the scene in the early 80's but has played occasional dates since his re-emergence four years ago. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sisario)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package.(Stephen Holden)    * Eartha Kitt (Tonight and tomorrow night) The latest edition of an act Ms. Kitt has been performing for decades is the lightest, swiftest and funniest one to date, and that's all to the good. More than ever, the singer, now a glamorous 79, pauses to poke fun at her status as the greatest and wittiest of all singing tigresses. At 8:45 and 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100. (Holden)    * JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night) A theater singer with jazz chops, Ms. Molaskey combines sophisticated wit, fierce intelligence and a lightly swinging voice that hovers on the keen edge between happy and sad. A hybrid of the bossa nova standard ''Desafinado'' and Billy Joel's ''Summer, Highland Falls'' performed Brazilian style is the pinnacle of a show whose material she describes as ''limbo songs.'' At 9 and 11:30, the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $50 cover; $60 prix fixe dinner required at the 9 p.m. shows; $20 minimum at the late shows. (Holden)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    THOMAS ANKERSMIT, BENTON-C BAINBRIDGE, BOBBY PREVITE (Tomorrow) Throughout July, the Issue Project Room in Brooklyn will present works specifically designed for its cylindrical space, and for the ceiling-hung 16-channel speaker system installed there. The first concert in the series features Mr. Ankersmit playing saxophones and electronics, Mr. Previte playing drums and electronics, and Mr. Bainbridge manipulating video images. At 8 p.m., Issue Project Room, 400 Carroll Street, between Bond and Nevins Streets, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org; cover, $10. (Nate Chinen)    CYRUS CHESTNUT TRIO (Wednesday through July 8) Mr. Chestnut is a stalwart straight-ahead pianist with a penchant for gospel and blues shadings. He is most comfortable with a trio; this one includes Michael Hawkins on bass and Neil Smith on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25; $30 next Friday and July 8. (Chinen)    THE CLARINETS (Tomorrow) Three clarinetists walk into a bar and manage to make music that's not only serious but also mysterious and broadly textured. The clarinetists are Anthony Burr, Oscar Noriega and Chris Speed, and their improvisational chemistry is no joke. At 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    GEORGE COLLIGAN AND MAD SCIENCE (Tomorrow) Last year Mr. Colligan, a keyboardist with a powerful rhythmic presence, released a modernistic organ trio album called ''Realization'' (Sirocco Music). He pursues a similar purpose here, with the guitarist Tom Guarna and the drummer Kenny Grohowski. At 10 p.m., Ace of Clubs, 9 Great Jones Street, between Broadway and Lafayette Streets, West Village, (212) 677-6963, www.aceofclubsnyc.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)    ERIK FRIEDLANDER'S BROKEN ARM (Thursday) This tribute to the bassist Oscar Pettiford and the pianist Herbie Nichols features Mr. Friedlander's pizzicato cello playing against a simple rhythm backdrop of bass (Kermit Driscoll) and drums (Mike Sarin). The name is an oblique reference to Mr. Pettiford; both Mr. Friedlander's arms are fine. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    BEN GERSTEIN COLLECTIVE (Sunday) Mr. Gerstein, a trombonist, has led this free-improvising ensemble for the last half-dozen years, enlisting bright young players like Jacob Sacks (on keyboards), Eivind Opsvik (on bass) and Jacob Garchik (on accordion and electronics). At 8 and 10 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, www.bar4.net; cover, $5. (Chinen)    CURTIS HASSELBRING'S NEW MELLOW EDWARDS/JOHN HOLLENBECK'S CLAUDIA QUINTET (Sunday) Two smart ensembles that harness the forward thrust of rock in the service of an almost chamberlike group cohesiveness. The trombonist Curtis Hasselbring's group is the more raucous of the two; the Claudia Quintet, led by the drummer John Hollenbeck, is the more refined. At 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)    VINCENT HERRING QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Herring, an alto saxophonist, rolls out a locomotive brand of post-bop with the help of Anthony Wonsey on piano, Richie Goods on bass and Joris Dudli on drums. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $25. (Chinen)    MALABY/SANCHEZ/RAINEY (Tonight) A trio that treads a middle ground between lyricism and abstraction, with Tony Malaby on saxophones, Angelica Sanchez on piano and Tom Rainey on drums.

(Chinen)    JOHN MCNEIL/BILL McHENRY QUARTET (Sunday) Mr. McNeil, a trumpeter, and Mr. McHenry, a tenor saxophonist, mostly play obscurities by the 1950's West Coast pianist Russ Freeman in this solid and often delightful quartet, with Tom Hubbard on bass and Jochen Rückert on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Night and Day, 230 Fifth Avenue, at President Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 399-2161; cover, $5, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    DAVY MOONEY TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Mooney has a coolly casual tone on guitar, and a vocal style to match. He offers an accessible and thoughtful variety of small-group swing, with Mark Anderson on bass and Ari Hoenig on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    * PAUL MOTIAN BAND (Through Sunday) This luminous ensemble consists of two contrasting pairs of improvisers (the tenor saxophonists Mark Turner and Chris Cheek, and the guitarists Steve Cardenas and Ben Monder); a couple of stabilizers (Jacob Bro and Jerome Harris, also guitarists); a lone anchor (the bassist Ben Street); and a mastermind (Mr. Motian, on drums). The band's last ECM album was excellent; its last Village Vanguard appearance, in January, was even better. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25 tonight and tomorrow, $20 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    RALPH PETERSON SEXTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) As a drummer, Mr. Peterson is a steamroller; as a bandleader, he's more like a sergeant. He has a way of producing strong results, as he probably will with this ensemble, featuring the trumpeter Igmar Thomas, the saxophonists Tia Fuller and Donald Lee, and the brotherly team of Zaccai and Luques Curtis on piano and bass. At 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    HERLIN RILEY AND FRIENDS (Through Sunday) Few contemporary jazz drummers groove as naturally as Mr. Riley, who presides here over a quartet composed of other strong musicians with ties to Wynton Marsalis: the tenor saxophonist and clarinetist Victor Goines, the pianist Eric Reed and the bassist Reginald Veal. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)    PETE ROBBINS AND CENTRIC (Tomorrow) ''Waits and Measures'' (Playscape), the new album by the alto saxophonist Pete Robbins, is an intimate sort of jazz-rock hybrid complete with Fender Rhodes electric piano and artfully fuzzed-out electric guitar. The group plays here without its guitarist, but is otherwise intact. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $6, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    GONZALO RUBALCABA TRIO (Through Sunday) Mr. Rubalcaba can be an astonishing pianist technically, and he plays with a sense of dramatic flourish instilled by the music of his native Cuba. He works here with a rhythm section that recently distinguished itself under the aegis of the alto saxophonist Greg Osby: Matt Brewer on bass and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30; $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)    ROMAN SKAKUN QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Skakun, a newly minted graduate of the New School jazz program, features his vibraphone playing and a few of his original compositions in this ensemble, which is impressively stocked with supporting players: the alto saxophonist Miguel Zenon, the pianist Bruce Barth, the bassist Doug Weiss and the drummer Jason Marsalis. At 10 and midnight, Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $10, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)    TYFT (Monday) This adventurous trio -- the guitarist Hilmar Jenssen, the alto saxophonist and bass clarinetist Andrew D'Angelo and the drummer Jim Black -- fashions roughly contoured music out of grainy texture and surging pulse. Their energy level is unflaggingly high, as is the caliber of their musicianship. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)    KEVIN UEHLINGER QUARTET (Wednesday) Biochemistry and the I Ching are hardly common themes in jazz, but Mr. Uehlinger, a keyboardist, has used aspects of both in his compositional framework. He has also employed musicians independent enough to strain against those constrictions: the trumpeter Nate Wooley, the bassist Keith Witty and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    * RANDY WESTON'S AFRICAN RHYTHMS TRIO/ELDAR (Wednesday through July 9) Mr. Weston, the pianist, has been one of the principal agents of an Africanized jazz aesthetic since his fateful first visit to Nigeria more than 40 years ago. He has an unfailingly expressive outlet in the ensemble African Rhythms, which appears here in trio form. Also on the bill is Eldar, a piano prodigy from Kyrgyzstan celebrating the release of his new trio album, ''Live at the Blue Note'' (Sony Classical), in the most appropriate setting. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    STEVE WILSON QUINTET (Tuesday through July 9) An alto saxophonist with a dry tone but a rounded sense of phrase, Mr. Wilson recruits an established rhythm section -- Bruce Barth on piano, Ed Howard on bass and Adam Cruz on drums -- and locks horns with the fine trumpeter Terrell Stafford. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; $25 next Friday and July 8, with a $10 minimum.

Opera    BERKSHIRE OPERA (Wednesday) Opera companies and orchestras everywhere are celebrating the 250th birthday of Mozart, and on Wednesday night it's the Berkshire Opera's turn. For this festive event, titled ''The Soul of Genius: A Mozart Celebration,'' the company, founded in 1985, has lined up some exciting performers, including young stars of the Metropolitan Opera. The sopranos Maureen O'Flynn and Christine Goerke, the tenor Mark Schowalter and the baritone Troy Cook will be joined by several members of the company's successful Resident Artists Program. The music director Kathleen Kelly conducts the Berkshire Opera Overture in a program including arias and ensembles from ''Le Nozze di Figaro,'' ''Don Giovanni'' and lesser-known works. The event takes place at the Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center in Great Barrington, Mass., and if you haven't seen this enchanting old theater since its extensive renovation, it alone is worth a trip. At 8 p.m., 30 Castle Street, (413) 442-0099; $35 to $85. (Anthony Tommasini)    LAKE GEORGE OPERA (Tonight through Thursday) ''Our Town,'' Ned Rorem's opera based on the Thornton Wilder play, is getting its first professional production from a company that may not have all the resources of the music school (Indiana University's) that gave it its world premiere. The company's other two offerings of its summer season are ''I Pagliacci'' and ''The Barber of Seville.'' ''Our Town,'' tomorrow at 8, Wednesday afternoon at 1; ''Barber,'' tomorrow afternoon at 1, Thursday night at 8; ''Pagliacci,'' tonight at 8, Sunday afternoon at 1.

Mozart, the ubiquitous birthday boy this year, is the focus of the first of the season's six concerts; it includes some perennial favorites (''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'' and ''Exsultate, Jubilate'') as well as ''Bastien and Bastienne,'' the singspiel he wrote when he was 12.

(Holland)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    * AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tonight and tomorrow; Monday, Wednesday and Thursday) The last three performances of Kevin McKenzie's ''Swan Lake'' are tonight and tomorrow. On Monday begins a mere four-performance run (the house will be dark on Tuesday) of Frederick Ashton's ''Sylvia,'' which was a critical hit last summer but which Ballet Theater apparently feels cannot sustain a full week's run. Instead, next weekend, there will be three more performances of ''Le Corsaire.'' The ''Sylvia'' is worth seeing, though, both for itself and to provide a contrast to Mark Morris's version, coming next month with the San Francisco Ballet. Ballet Theater's season continues until July 15. Tonight, tomorrow night and Monday, Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8; tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m.; Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000 or abt.org; $23 to $100.

At 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $15; $10 for students.

(Tonight through Sunday; Thursday) This eclectic whirl of a downtown-dance festival continues at three theaters in the La MaMa complex with ''Mavericks in Motion,'' whose choreographers include Abby Chen, Bhavani Lee and Deborah Lohse (tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 2:30 p.m.); the highly recommended ''Dancing Divas'' program of choreography by Pat Catterson, Ellen Fisher, Keely Garfield, Sally Gross, Deborah Jowitt, Jodi Melnick, Yvonne Meier and Vicky Shick (tonight at 10); ''Children of Ur,'' which includes dances by Karinne Keithley, David Neuman, Nicky Paraiso and the program curator, Chris Yon (tomorrow at 5:30 p.m.); ''Burlesque,'' whose stars include Julie Atlas Muz and Dirty Martini (tomorrow at 10 p.m.); ''Duet,'' with a roster of five pairs of dancer-choreographers (Sunday at 5:30 p.m.); and ''Border Jumping,'' with work by six artists, including Bill Irwin, representing the United States (Thursday at 7:30 p.m.). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, west of Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 475-7710 or www.lamama.org; $10 (Dunning)    NICHOLAS LEICHTER ( Tomorrow) For its 10th-anniversary season, the company Nicholasleichterdance presents four pieces commissioned by Dance New Amsterdam, which date from 1997 (''Animal'') to 2006 (''Sweetwash Special''). It is an opportunity to see how much both the choreographer and Dance New Amsterday, which was formerly known as Dance Space and now has splendid new digs downtown, have grown. At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200 or www.dnadance.org; $20, or $15 for members. (Erika Kinetz)    * NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tonight through Sunday; Thursday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, has settled into the intimate Theater 80 for this month and next, through July 30. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 8; tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m.; Sunday at 5 p.m.; Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45.

Both are at 8 p.m. The Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $30. (Kinetz)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)    COOPER HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Sept. 24. A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Ken Johnson)    * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' (See above.) (Glueck)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual, reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * met: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710. (Kimmelman)    * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)    MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)    Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. One of the most interesting concerns the genteel technique of cut-paper silhouette that is the basis of Ms. Walker's scathing take-no-prisoners exploration of slavery and its tragic legacy. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)    Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3 Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman)    Museum of Modern Art: Douglas Gordon: 'Timeline,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. Museum of Modern Art. (212) 708-9400. (Johnson)    * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through January. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second in a trio of exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter)    New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 19. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith)    NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)    Galleries: Uptown    * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith)    * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    Eva Lundsager: 'Wherever' Improvising with infectiously playful freedom on medium-large canvases, Ms. Lundsager creates hedonistic and trippy abstract landscapes composed of dots, squiggles, woozy stripes, smudgy areas, luminous open spaces, and colors ranging from neon bright to muddy brown. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444, through next Friday. (Johnson)    * Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by this young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design; and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Johnson)    EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING'  This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck)    Galleries: Chelsea    'Nightmares of Summer' This entertaining selection of dark, weird and nasty visions includes Marilyn Minter's big photograph of dirty feet with toenails painted fashionably green; Barnaby Furnas's explosive, cartoonish painting of a woman at the beach spilling blood-red wine; an otherworldly coppery seascape by Stuart Elster; photographs by Anders Petersen, Hans Bellmer and Diane Arbus; drawings by Carroll Dunham and Steve DiBenedetto; and more. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-3363, through July 8. (Johnson)    'Scarecrow' The work in this show is supposed to be menacing and abrasive, but it is mostly interesting and amusing. Highlights include David Herbert's giant, handmade replica of a ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' videocassette; Rashid Johnson's life-size, photographic nude self-portrait; David Kennedy Cutler's model of the White House made of chewing gum and imbedded in dirt; and a short Matthew Barney-like film by Chris Larson. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212) 727-3323, through July 8. (Johnson)    Martin Schoeller: 'Close Up' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Sept. 1. (Johnson)    * Stephen Shore The postcard-size color pictures of diners, restaurant meals, hotel rooms, roadside signs, ordinary people and other nondescript subjects taken by this eminent photographer on cross-country road trips in the early 1970's are enthralling, beautiful, nostalgic and romantic. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, through July 7. (Johnson)    RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Aug. 11. (Smith)    Last Chance    Jackie Gendel: 'Portraits' With seemingly offhand painterly verve, smudgy colors and a sweet sense of humor, Ms. Gendel creates smart and sensuous, semi-abstract riffs on Modernist portraiture. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156; closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    * NEW VIDEO, NEW EUROPE A selection of 49 tapes by 40 artists from 16 Eastern European countries, several of which did not exist before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, presents bits and pieces of another world. Revolution, landmines, economic hardship and disappearing ways of life alternate with wit and artistic originality. The whole forms an inadvertent documentary, but many of the parts are well worth attention. The Kitchen, 512 East 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793; closing today. (Smith)    * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed. (One gallery bursts with color, another has a cool, platinum shimmer.) The 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500; closing Sunday.

Eighteen active wineries now dot the river's east and west sides -- all within a two-and-a-half-hour drive from New York City.

Poor planning forced Mr. Reagan to abandon his Social Security package almost as soon as he announced it last spring.

With a set of critical budget decisions looming, and before the embarrassing controversy over the Administration's racial attitudes, Mr. Baker took time out to assess the White House management system.

I am getting sicker. Time is running out.   Once AIDS was a hot topic in America -- promising treatments on the horizon, intense media interest, a political battlefield. Now, 12 years after it was first recognized as a new disease, AIDS has become normalized, part of the landscape. It is at once everywhere and nowhere, the leading cause of death among young men nationwide, but little threat to the core of American political power, the white heterosexual suburbanite. No cure or vaccine is in sight. And what small treatment advances had been won are now crumbling. The world is moving on, uncaring, frustrated and bored, leaving by the roadside those of us who are infected and who can't help but wonder: Whatever happened to AIDS? As a journalist who has written about this disease for five years, and as a patient who has had it for nearly as long, I went out looking for answers. THE DISEASE AND THE DOCTORS DR. ANTHONY S. FAUCI SPEAKS WITH A HINT of a Brooklyn accent, which is out of sync with the elegance of his appearance -- well tailored, tidy, trim. At 52, he is scientist-cum-celebrity, ridiculed by Larry Kramer in the play \\"The Destiny of Me,\\" lionized by George Bush in the 1988 Presidential debate as a hero.   Being the Government's point man on AIDS has made Tony Fauci (rhymes with OUCH-ee) famous. He professes to be solely the scientist. But in fact, he is very much the star and the politician, one year defending modest Reagan-Bush AIDS budget proposals as adequate, the next defending generous Clinton proposals as necessary. He is the activist's enemy -- \\"Murderer!\\" Kramer once called him in an essay published in The Village Voice. He is the activist's friend, a comrade in arms, showing up last October at the opening of the Kramer play wearing a red AIDS ribbon.   Fauci's starring AIDS role comes from the many hats he wears -- among them director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and director of the National Institutes of Health's Office of AIDS Research.   \\"Fauci deserves a lot of the blame for where we are on AIDS,\\" said Peter Staley of TAG, the activist Treatment Action Group. But others say that is not fair. \\"You can't blame any one person,\\" said Gregg Gonsalves, who wrote TAG's report on the status of AIDS research. \\"We've gotten to the edge of a scientific cliff.\\"   Whatever Fauci's faults, I have never doubted his commitment. Still, he is the face of the AIDS scientific community, and 12 years into the disease there are only temporary treatments that work for a few years at most. AIDS remains a fatal illness. Approximately a million Americans are believed to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, the key component of AIDS, and virtually all of them are expected to develop the disease eventually. Close to half a million Americans are expected to have full-blown AIDS by the end of next year; more than 200,000 have already died. Roughly 350,000 will have died by the end of 1994. The World Health Organization puts the number infected worldwide at more than 13 million adults and an additional 1 million or more children.   So far, the only treatments are nucleoside analogues, drugs like AZT, DDC and DDI. A fourth nucleoside analogue, D4T, is expected to be approved by the spring. Fauci has focused national research efforts on these analogues, which slow the virus by fooling it with a decoy of genetic material it needs to reproduce. But the analogues have problems. They are highly toxic, and the virus, which mutates rapidly, eventually catches on to the deception.   Everyone knew going into the international AIDS conference in Berlin in June that the nucleoside analogues were of limited use, but the horrible surprise was just how limited. A report issued just before the meeting -- the Concorde Study, conducted in England, France and Ireland -- found that, contrary to the recommendations of the United States Government, use of AZT before the onset of AIDS symptoms did not necessarily prolong life. (In an extraordinary action, a United States Government panel has since pulled back the earlier recommendation. AZT is still recommended for those with full-blown AIDS. But the panel left it for patients and their doctors to decide on earlier use.)   A subsequent Australian study, published in July, found that AZT, used early, did prolong life. I have always felt that it has prolonged mine. Still, what makes the fuss over AZT so stunning is not just that the drug has shortcomings -- almost everyone knew that from the start. It is that AZT, flawed as it was, had become the Gold Standard of treatment, against which other therapies were being measured. The chilling message of the AZT dispute is this: Things are not just failing to get better; they are getting worse. We are losing ground.   \\"The fallout from Berlin has been devastating,\\" said Martin Delaney, founding director of Project Inform, an AIDS treatment information and lobbying group. \\"There were no surprises. But the risk now is that AIDS gets put up on the shelf along with a lot of other long-term unresolved problems. We lose the urgency for money and the scientific momentum.\\" The bad news has left drug companies scrambling. Last spring things were so desperate that a group of 15 announced they would pool research data. Many scientists -- and activists -- are fed up with the drug companies, which seem hellbent on pursuing more nucleoside analogues when the real future of AIDS treatment probably lies with gene therapy. The idea is to alter the genetic structure of cells to make them inhospitable to H.I.V. But the problem is, no one knows how to translate the occasional test-tube success into a workable treatment. In addition, most of the gene therapies are being developed by small biotechnology companies that will take years to get into full production.   So, was all the time and money spent on the nucleoside analogues wasted? Fauci, who obviously has an investment in the answer, was emphatic that it wasn't. \\"People say the Berlin meeting was so depressing, nothing's happening,\\" Fauci said in his office overlooking the N.I.H. campus in Bethesda, Md. \\"I say that's not the way science works. There are little steps, building blocks. What's important is whether you're going in the right direction, and I am convinced that we are.   \\"Was it grossly inappropriate to do the extensive studies of AZT and DDI?\\" he continued. \\"No. Should we have done more with other drugs? If we had them, one could say, yes.   \\"Let's say a year and a half from now, nevirapine isn't working,\\" Fauci said of an experimental drug undergoing trials in combination with the nucleoside analogues. \\"Somebody's going to say, 'Why did you waste all that time with it?' But you don't know it doesn't work until you test it.\\"   If Fauci is defensive, it may be because he is still smarting from a political bruising. His Office of AIDS Research has been reorganized by the Clinton Administration and he has been, in effect, ousted -- done in by the AIDS activists through their Democratic friends in Congress. And while some of his time is being diverted to playing politics, in his own laboratory research he has now returned to basics -- Square 1 -- where many AIDS researchers are working. Fauci is studying the pathogenesis of the disease, its route through the body.   I asked him the obvious: 12 years into the disease -- shouldn't we know that already? \\"More effort looking at pathogenesis might have been appropriate in retrospect,\\" Fauci responded. \\"But we were constantly being diverted -- by the activists, by Congress. It was: 'What can you give me right now? Get those drugs out there as quickly as you can.' \\"   Not so long ago we believed that if we just could find enough money, we could make the disease manageable, like diabetes. But in a further sign of how little hope exists these days in the scientific community, money isn't seen as the main issue anymore.   \\"Certainly, there are more scientific opportunities than there are resources to fulfill them,\\" Fauci said, echoing the views of other scientists. \\"But should we dump billions into AIDS research now? I think we'd reach a point of diminishing returns.\\"   Fauci presents a front of optimism, at least for me. After all, there is no cure for any virus, only vaccines to prevent them -- measles is an example. By the year 2000, he predicted, \\"We'll be into vaccine trials that show a vaccine is much more feasible than we thought, though we may not have the best vaccine by then.\\"   Other scientists are unconvinced. They point out that the rapid mutation of the AIDS virus and its many strains make development of a vaccine difficult.    \\"The public is frustrated; it says, 'You've been working on this for 10 years,' \\" said Dr. Irvin S. Y. Chen, director of the AIDS Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. Chen bemoaned the lack of money for biomedical research in general, which he said was discouraging the best and the brightest from entering the field.   \\"We're in that in-between stage,\\" said Dr. Merle A. Sande, an AIDS expert at the University of California at San Francisco; he was head of the Government panel on AZT use. \\"We know a lot about the virus, but we just don't seem able to translate that knowledge into significant treatment advances. It's incredibly frustrating.\\"   Still, the frustration of the public and the scientists is nothing compared with the frustration of those of us living with AIDS or H.I.V. Will people still be dying of AIDS in the year 2000? Fauci didn't hesitate for a second before replying, \\"I don't think there's any question that will be the case.\\" THE ACTIVISTS AND THE GOVERNMENT TIM BAILEY WAS ONE OF THE MARYS, AND THAT'S AS close to Act Up royalty as anybody can get.   The Marys are a subgroup of Act Up, the group involved in the more radical demonstrations, like disrupting services at St. Patrick's Cathedral. When Bailey died in June at 35, stipulating that he wanted a political funeral in Washington, Act Up was obliged to comply.   So on a drizzly Thursday at 7 A.M., two buses filled with Act Up members set out from New York. They were to rendezvous with the body in Washington, then carry the open coffin through the streets from the Capitol to the White House. They would show Bill Clinton the urgency of AIDS. They would bring one of its carcasses to his doorstep.   But it was not to be. The police would not let them march, and the day turned into a sodden fiasco, as the police and activists quarreled over the body, shoving the coffin in and out of a van parked in front of the Capitol. The rage was there, but the organization was not. And when the police said no, where did Act Up members run for help but the White House, the very target of their protest, getting Bob Hattoy, a White House staff member with AIDS, to intervene. In the end, Act Up members gave up and went home, taking the body with them.   It was a perfect metaphor for the state of AIDS activism -- raging in desperate but unfocused anger, one foot on the inside, one on the outside.   The AIDS movement was built on grass-roots efforts. Now those efforts are in disarray. Many Act Up leaders have died. The group's very existence was based on the belief that AIDS could be cured quickly if only enough money and effort were thrown at it -- something that now seems increasingly in doubt. Besides, it is hard to maintain attacks against a Government that is seeking big increases in AIDS spending. Much of the cream of Act Up has fled, forming groups like TAG and joining mainstream AIDS organizations like the Gay Men's Health Crisis and the American Foundation for AIDS Research.   Those left behind are Act Up's hard core. Act Up was always part theater, part group therapy. Now, sadly, Act Up is increasingly reduced to burying its dead.   To say all that is not to belittle the accomplishments of the group. One reason for Act Up's decline is that it has got so much of what it wanted. Act Up forced AIDS into the Presidential race, dogging candidates. Because of Act Up the price of AZT is lower. Drugs are approved more quickly. Today it is a given that the communities affected by a disease have a voice, and must be consulted. To a great extent, Act Up deserves much of the credit for the increasing political power of the entire gay rights movement. But now even the gay movement has pushed AIDS to the sidelines.   Anyone questioning how AIDS ranks as an issue among gay groups need only look to the march on Washington on April 25. Six years earlier, in 1987, a similar gay march had one overriding theme: AIDS. If there was a dominant theme last April, it was homosexuals in the military. To be sure, AIDS was an element of the march, but just an element. Speaker after speaker ignored it.   \\"It's like they are waiting for us to die so they can get on with their agenda,\\" said Dr. Nicholas A. Rango, the director of New York State's AIDS Institute, a gay man who himself has AIDS and watched the march on C-Span from his Manhattan hospital bed.  [ He died on Nov. 10. ]   Torie Osborn, formerly executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, argued that the shift was inevitable with the election of a Democratic President, renewed attacks from the right wing and just plain burnout. Increasingly, many homosexuals, especially those who test negative for H.I.V., do not want a disease to be what defines their community. \\"There is a deep yearning to broaden the agenda beyond AIDS,\\" she said. \\"There's a natural need for human beings who are in deep grieving to reach for a future beyond their grieving.   \\"It's one thing to be fighting for treatment, believing you're going to get a cure that will have everyone survive,\\" continued Osborn, who recently buried three friends who had died of AIDS. \\"But it's an incredibly depressing truth that AIDS has become part of the backdrop of gay life.\\"   What is to some a broadening of the gay agenda, however, is to others desertion. \\"It's one thing for the politicians to abandon AIDS,\\" Kevin Frost, a TAG member, said. \\"But for our own community to abandon the issue.  . . . Who brought this issue of gays in the military out in the open? A couple of flashy queers with checkbooks. Well, what about AIDS?\\"   What about AIDS? Perhaps the greatest development affecting Act Up, the activist community and the entire AIDS care world is the changing face of the disease. Homosexual sex still accounts for the majority of cases, 57 percent. But that number is dropping, down from 61 percent in 1989. Meanwhile, the percentage of cases tied to intravenous drug use is beginning to climb. It is now at 23 percent, up from 21 percent in 1989.   Black and Hispanic groups are clamoring for a greater role in running AIDS care organizations. Their intentions seem genuine -- what do gay groups know of inner-city drug use? -- but also seem driven in part by a desire for money and power. In an age of Government cutbacks, AIDS is where the money is -- \\"today's equivalent of the Great Society programs of the 60's,\\" as Rango put it.   In Washington and Houston, gay groups and black and Hispanic groups are bickering over who should control the money and the programs. In New York, the largest AIDS care organization, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, is trying valiantly to be all things to all constituencies -- it contributed $25,000 to the lobbying effort to allow homosexuals in the military even as it was helping to expand legal services in Harlem. Inevitably, focus is lost.   G.M.H.C. has recently changed executive directors, as have many of the more than 3,500 AIDS organizations in the United States. The average executive director of an AIDS service group lasts less than two years, burned out by depression and exhausted by the bickering among AIDS constituencies.   \\"We should be fighting the virus, not each other,\\" said Dan Bross, the executive director of the AIDS Action Council. \\"We're eating our young.\\"   MARY FISHER, WHO ADDRESSED THE REPUBLICAN National Convention in Houston as a woman infected with H.I.V., whom I interviewed at the time and who has since become a friend, also believes the AIDS movement is adrift. She was sitting at lunch in Manhattan with Larry Kramer, both of them bemoaning the state of AIDS activism.   \\"We need to agree on the goals,\\" Fisher said.   \\"That's just rhetoric,\\" Kramer shot back. \\"The goal is to find a cure.\\"   Fisher sees AIDS entering a dangerous never-never land, with the day fast approaching when no one will be carrying the AIDS banner.   \\"The gay community is going to stop screaming,\\" she said. \\"It is already stopping.\\"   \\"I'm very despondent,\\" Kramer said. \\"You don't know where to yell or who to yell at. Clinton says all the right things, then doesn't do anything.\\"   Indeed, the Clinton Administration does say all the right things, at times coming close to being patronizing about it.   \\"I have a real understanding that the people who feel the strongest about this, they don't have time,\\" Carol H. Rasco, the President's top domestic policy adviser, said in defense of the zealotry of Act Up. \\"When a bomb is ticking inside you, you have to keep pushing.\\"   Where once Washington doors were closed to AIDS activists, they are now open. Indeed, perhaps the single biggest AIDS change in Washington under the Clinton Administration has been one of tone. AIDS sufferers are no longer treated as immoral lepers. David Barr, director of treatment education and advocacy for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, recalled a May meeting with Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.   \\"She agreed to everything we wanted,\\" Barr said. \\"I was amazed. We're so used to doing battle. But is it a ploy?\\"   Certainly Bill Clinton is a vast improvement over George Bush. The President proposed a major increase in spending on AIDS research, about 20 percent, coming up with an additional $227 million. That would raise the total N.I.H. spending on AIDS research to $1.3 billion. In aid for outpatient care, the White House proposed a giant increase in what is known as Ryan White money, named for the Midwestern teen-ager who died of AIDS in April 1990. The current appropriation is $348 million, which the Administration proposed to nearly double by adding $310 million. The House didn't add the entire amount, just a $200 million increase, but it still brought the total to $548 million. The Senate was slightly more generous, and the final appropriation was $579 million.   But is more money enough? AIDS activists say they want leadership, but they are not sure anymore what that means.   \\"It was much easier,\\" said Torie Osborn, \\"when we could hate George Bush and Ronald Reagan, when we thought we had evil genocidal Republican Presidents who weren't doing what needed to be done to get a cure.\\"   Still, as is so often the case with Bill Clinton, he is a victim of his own lofty campaign rhetoric. He spoke eloquently about AIDS in his pitches for the gay vote. He insisted that people infected with the AIDS virus, Bob Hattoy and Elizabeth Glaser, speak at the Democratic National Convention. On Election Night, he mentioned AIDS high in his victory speech. It all seemed so promising. David B. Mixner, a Clinton friend who helped rally the gay vote, exclaimed in the flush of a Clinton victory, \\"I believe thousands of my friends who wouldn't make it, who would die of AIDS, might make it now because Bill Clinton is President.\\"   There it is: the man from Arkansas was to be not just President but savior. He's not. Bogged down early on in a battle over homosexuals in the military, Clinton has grown wary of anything that the public might perceive as a gay issue. He delayed fulfilling his campaign pledge to name an AIDS czar, finally naming her five months into his term -- and only when the National Commission on AIDS was about to attack him for not providing leadership on the epidemic.   More than anything else, what the AIDS community wants from Bill Clinton is a sense of urgency. Carol Rasco maintains that Clinton is committed. \\"Health-care reform and AIDS are the only things I've worked on every day since I got here,\\" said the domestic policy adviser. But others, even in the Administration, think Clinton is doing little to help.   \\"Other than myself, who lives with AIDS every day, there's no one at the White House for whom this is their first-tier issue,\\" said Bob Hattoy, who, after serving six months as a White House aide often critical of the Administration's AIDS policies, was shifted to the Interior Department. He praised the President and Mrs. Clinton for having \\"a profoundly sensitive awareness about AIDS,\\" but at the staff level, he said, \\"AIDS is not on the radar screens at the White House every day.\\" And the political advisers? Hattoy scoffed. \\"I don't think they'll address AIDS until the Perot voters start getting it.\\" THE CZAR AND THE PRESS THERE WAS A TIME when it was thought that the solution to the AIDS crisis could be found in two words: AIDS czar. One omnipotent public figure with the power to marshal funds, direct research, cut through the bureaucracy -- in short, to lead a Manhattan Project-size effort to force a cure for AIDS. Kristine M. Gebbie doesn't look like a czar, and she doesn't think of herself as one, either.   At 50, she has the air of the head nurse. There is something at once no-nonsense and fussy about her -- her erect posture, her precise and proper answers, her tendency to correct an interviewer's questions. She is what she is -- a nurse who worked her way up through the public-health bureaucracy, a divorced mother of three children, who has willed herself to a better lot in life. In 1978 she became the chief health officer of Oregon and then, 11 years later, the chief health officer of Washington State. Her experience with AIDS is primarily as a bureaucrat, as chairman of the Centers for Disease Control's advisory panel on H.I.V. prevention and as a member of the National Commission on AIDS.   Now, she is the AIDS czar -- a far cry from the stellar names that AIDS activists had fantasized about: H. Norman Schwarzkopf, Jimmy Carter, C. Everett Koop.    \\"We wanted 'Jurassic Park,' and we got 'Snow White,' \\" Larry Kramer likes to say.   \\"The activists wanted a war on AIDS,\\" Gebbie said, shaking her head. \\"I am not one of the big names. I am someone who has struggled with systems around this epidemic since the beginning. I think I have a feel for what it takes to bring people together.\\"   Indeed, asked to give her job description, she responded, \\"consensus builder.\\"   Gebbie, whose official title is national AIDS policy coordinator, sees her job as exactly that -- coordinating the various Federal agencies like Defense and Housing and Education in terms of prevention, care and research. Her goal is to have the agencies themselves take over the assault on AIDS, so she sees hers as a short-term job -- 3 or 5 years, \\"10 years tops.\\" She expects to take no role in research other than, again, as a coordinator, but not one who independently sets priorities.   And what happened to the eagerly awaited Manhattan Project?   \\"Manhattan Project?\\" Gebbie said. \\"I don't know what that means. Both the Manhattan Project and the Man-on-the-Moon project involved, I think, a much more targeted goal. We know where we'd like to go -- fix AIDS -- but I'm not sure we can conceptualize what it would take to do that. On the other hand, if what 'Manhattan Project' conveys is: 'The Government is behind you,' well, if I do my job right, we will target and have energy and direction. What we won't have is somebody in general's stripes who can walk around and order people, 'Drop what you're doing and work on H.I.V.' \\"   Gebbie advocates distributing condoms to sexually active teen-agers, though not necessarily in the schools. She supports supplying clean needles to drug addicts. She backs \\"in extreme cases and only as a very last resort\\" the isolation of people infected with H.I.V. who continue to be sexually irresponsible. \\"It might be in a hospital or a group home,\\" she said. And she advocates, in theory, and with full civil rights protection, the reporting of names of those with H.I.V. as a public-health technique for making sure connections are made to their partners for counseling and possible treatment.   Kristine Gebbie was not at the top of the Administration's list of candidates for AIDS czar. Most of the medical and private-sector leaders who were approached said they had withdrawn their names for personal reasons. Yet it was clear that they did not regard the post as the all-powerful one it might have been.   \\"There's this contradiction,\\" said Dr. Mark D. Smith, a San Francisco AIDS expert who discussed the job with the Administration but eventually withdrew, \\"between the public perception of great responsibility and the reality of no real organizational authority.\\"   Most of those considered said, however, that they might have taken the job as AIDS adviser to the President if Clinton himself had called to convince them. But he didn't. The $112,000-a-year position, which does not require Senate confirmation, was offered to Gebbie in a phone call from Rasco. Gebbie never met the President until the morning of the June 25 news conference to announce her appointment.   To be fair, on that sunny Friday in the Rose Garden when he announced the appointment of Gebbie, the President sounded like the old Bill Clinton, the one in the campaign. He finally did what the activists wanted -- he spoke out on AIDS as President. He labeled the virus \\"one of the most dreaded and mysterious diseases humanity has ever known\\" and \\"an epidemic that has already claimed too many of our brothers and sisters, our parents and children, our friends and colleagues.\\"   But the trouble was, no one was listening. Newspapers and the networks reported the naming of Gebbie. But few carried the President's comments on AIDS. Newsweek magazine, in a week-in-the-life-of-the-President piece, didn't even mention the Gebbie announcement. At the news conference, there was only one question on AIDS, and that was directed to Gebbie about her qualifications. Reporters were eager to move on to the real news, like the budget and homosexuals in the military.   AIDS, it seems, had become old news.   \\"In the early days of AIDS, when knowledge was expanding, there were lots of very compelling things to write about,\\" said Marlene Cimons, who covers AIDS and Federal health policy out of the Washington bureau of The Los Angeles Times. \\"We were in the infant stages of making policy decisions about AIDS that had unique social and political ramifications. Now it's become harder to find angles. We've written to death most aspects of the disease: AIDS in the classroom. AIDS in the workplace. Testing. They filled the front pages. Now there's a vacuum.\\"   Stuart Shear, a reporter for \\"The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour\\" who covers AIDS, said the conflicts that had made for good stories -- the fights between Republican Administrations and AIDS advocates -- were gone.   \\"It's become a pure science story,\\" he said. \\"When it gets down to the clinical nitty-gritty, that's not what we look at. It's hard to get people to come on and complain about an Administration that's increasing funding.\\"   For her part, Gebbie, who has a budget of just under $3 million and a staff \\"of four or five\\" -- with 15 to 20 others, she said, in another office -- seems to prefer being in the shadows. Her office will not be in the White House but in a building across the street that houses a McDonald's. \\"My guess,\\" she said, \\"is that the choice of me makes clear that this isn't intended to be somebody who spends all their time outside rousing people up, but somebody who is prepared to spend a lot of time inside making it work.   \\"It's very clear how many people really did expect miracles,\\" Gebbie said. \\"When I give what I know are appropriate answers, I know I sound like a bureaucratic stick-in-the-mud: 'This lady is not worth two bits to us; she talks about coordination and cooperation. Blah!'    \\"But part of my mission,\\" Gebbie said matter-of-factly, \\"is to help people keep their expectations within reality.\\"   Gebbie needn't worry. Expectations could hardly be lower. \\"People are weary and hopeless and sad -- the researchers, the activists, the care-givers,\\" John H. Templeton, director of AIDS educational services at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, told me. \\"There is this sense that no matter what you do, it's all going to turn out the same in the end.\\" THE PATIENT AND JOURNALIST  IN MY INTERVIEWS FOR this article and others, I always ask people with AIDS if they expect to die of the disease. One reason for that is a genuine reporter's curiosity; the answer is part of the profile of who they are. But I am also searching for hope for myself. Increasingly, the answers come back the same, even from the most optimistic of Act Up zealots: Yes, we will die of AIDS.    I thought about that the other day in the emergency room at Lenox Hill Hospital. I had taken my boyfriend there for a blood transfusion to offset the anemia caused by the chemotherapy for his Kaposi's sarcoma. I realized on that Sunday morning in the emergency room that the moment of crisis wasn't coming tomorrow or the next day for my boyfriend. It was here today. And it will soon be here today for me, too.   Does that make me angry? Yes. I had such hope when I interviewed Bill Clinton about AIDS and gay issues for this magazine in August 1992. He spoke so eloquently on AIDS. I really did see him as a white knight who might save me. How naive I was to think that one man could make that big a difference. At its core, the problem isn't a government; it's a virus.   Still, in interviews with researchers and Administration officials, it was clear that we are talking from different planets. I need help now, not five years from now. Yet the urgency just wasn't there. Compassion and concern, yes; even sympathy. But urgency, no. I felt alone, abandoned, cheated.   I asked Gebbie what she says to someone with AIDS -- in other words, what she says to me. And for one brief moment, there was a glimmer of realization that delay means death.   \\"I say, 'I hear you and I appreciate the frustration and the sorrow and the loneliness,' \\" she said. \\"That can sound trite, but it is genuine. It's inappropriate for me to hold out a false promise to you. It would be easy to say: 'There, there. It will be better soon.' That's a disservice, so I have to be honest with you. We don't have quick answers. I can't tell you when we're going to have a cure.\\"   I am on the cutting edge of drug testing, in a trial at New York Hospital for a new combination therapy: AZT, DDI and nevirapine. That is the combination that drew so much publicity last February when researchers in Boston declared that they had found the combination was effective in inhibiting the virus. But at the Berlin conference, the formulator of the concept, Yung-Kang Chow, a Harvard medical student, reported a flaw in part of the original study. Other researchers challenged the findings after they were unable to confirm the results.    I was surprised at how jealous many of my fellow members of the support group were when I got into the trial -- 1 of only 25 people accepted out of more than 400 applicants. The group members felt that I had used influence. I had not. Yet admission to these trials is not purely luck, either -- a point driven home when a number of leading researchers called, offering to get me into one of the nevirapine trials. I did not take them up on it. If my doctors used influence to get me in, it was not with my knowledge. But I am grateful if they did. The ship is beginning to sink; the water is lapping onto the deck. I am eager for any lifeboat, however leaky.   The letters pour in from readers who know I have AIDS, which I wrote about in this newspaper last December. A Florida woman wrote detailing her son's agonizing death from AIDS. Halfway through the letter, she caught herself, suddenly blurting out, \\"I don't know why I am writing this to you.\\" Like so many of the letters, it was really not so much for me as for the writer, an excuse to open up her heart and let out the pain. She ended with a line I think of often, a line as much for her dead son, also named Jeffrey, as for me. \\"I intend this letter,\\" she wrote, \\"as a mother's hug.\\"   Hardly a day goes by without my getting a letter or call from someone who has the cure for AIDS. Many are crackpots. But others, I'm not so sure. Perhaps I will soon be desperate enough to pursue them.    More and more of the letters are nasty, even cruel. They are still the minority, but they make clear how deep the resentment runs against the attention given AIDS.   \\"As an average American,\\" a man from Brooklyn wrote in a letter to the editor that made its way to me, \\"I cannot feel compassion for those who contracted AIDS through the pleasures of homosexuality, promiscuity or drug injection. The advent of the AIDS sickness in the world breaks my heart -- but only for those who contracted it from blood transfusion, medical skin pricks or birth. The insipid news stories and other media accounts of AIDS pain, pneumonias and cancers attempt to reach me, but they only turn me off. And I, in turn, turn them off, as I suppose that millions of your readers do. Let's permit these pleasure seekers of the flesh to live out their years in hospices or homes at minimal cost and then die.\\"   Am I bitter? Increasingly, yes. At the Act Up funeral for Bailey in Washington, I thought of how much the anger of the activists mirrored my own. I, too, wanted to shout -- at no one really, just to vent the rage. I am dying. Why doesn't someone help us?   I didn't shout. I couldn't. All I could think about on that rainy Thursday afternoon was that a political funeral is not for me. It is at once very noble and very tacky.   What, then, is for me? I usually say that my epitaph is not a phrase but the body of my work. I am writing it with each article, including this one. But actually, there is a phrase that I want shouted at my funeral and written on the memorial cards, a phrase that captures the mix of cynicism and despair that I feel right now and that I will almost certainly take to my grave: Whatever happened to AIDS?

Yesterday, the stock dipped $1.50, to $79, in over-the-counter trading.   Analysts credit this rousing performance by the company named after a gazelle to soaring profits, shrewd marketing to fit a footwear niche and rapid acceptance by a fashion-conscious public.

Short-sellers, dubious of the sharp ascent in Reebok's shares, repeatedly have been outfoxed and forced to buy back the stock - thereby sending its price even higher. The shares traded as low as $40.625 in April, only to finish the month at $66.25. Last week, they rose $11.25, to $74.75.  The company's profit growth has been impressive indeed.

They don't seem to belong to real life, but rather to a series of pictorial scenes. Caleb, for instance, never relaxes from his ruthlessness, not even when he is folding a piece of paper. He is an old devil who tries to benefit by both sickness and misfortune. The tired eyes of a dying man do not prevent him from showing his greed for more land. He holds his family as if they were prisoners on his farm and it is no wonder that Judith longs for the freedom of wild geese.There is something reminiscent of \\"Stark Love\\" about two episodes of this picture. It is when Judith flings a chopper at her father. She misses him and the chopper sticks in the wooden wall. In another chapter the mother, driven to a point of madness, also threatens the inhuman Caleb, and she tells her husband that she will see that her aim is straight.During the course of these stretches it is only natural to wonder why the daughter and the mother wanted to throw the chopper when they could have used it more effectively by keeping it in their hands. Judith, in fun struggles with Sven Sandbo, with whom she is in love, and she proves to be about Sven's equal in strength. Hence it appeals to the spectator that mother and daughter together could have given Caleb a thrashing that he would have remembered.Providence, however, sees to it that Caleb meets his end in a treacherous swamp on his own farm. He is depicted, caught in the marsh and then one perceives him sinking from sight until his hat is left floating on the pool of mud and water.Belle Bennett gives a painstaking portrait of Amelia Gare. Russell Simpson, through direction, accentuates Caleb's movements and expressions to the point that the character loses some of its strength. Judith Gare is impersonated quite ably by Eve Southern. Her eyes are made up somewhat alarmingly, but her acting, except for a little too much posing, is impressive, particularly in the amusing wrestling match she has with Sven.

It is disjointed, slow-paced and much too long. Some of its scenes are poorly directed, but most of them are expertly handled. It may not be imbued with suspense, but it does succeed in arousing curiosity as to the final outcome of its events.In the introductory episodes, after glimpses of wet asphalt streets, Policeman Albert Holk is perceived on a safety isle regulating busy traffic. Then the film shifts to a jewelry store, where Mary, a beautiful brunette, is perceived carrying on a flirtation with the proprietor as he exhibits half a dozen diamonds. One of the stones falls to the floor and Mary, while pretending to listen to the old man's flattering words, manoeuvres so that her umbrella ferrule, on which there is some sticky substance, picks up the gem.Mary leaves the shop and soon there is consternation among the salesmen and the proprietor. Mary is indignant when she is asked to return to the establishment and then, after she has been searched by a female attendant, she is prepared to leave, exonerated, when Policeman Holk, who has been called, discovers the diamond stuck on the ferrule of her umbrella. The proprietor of the store intercedes with Holk to release Mary, but the policeman insists that he must do his duty.The subsequent developments tell how Holk, whose father is a sergeant in the Berlin police force, becomes infatuated with Mary. Later he worries over his dereliction of duty, but when he calls to see Mary to return a present of a box of cigars she has sent him, he is still further enamored of the woman. Mary's lover, Ward, who poses in Paris as a German consular agent, succeeds in robbing a bank and when he returns to the German capital he surprises Holk and Mary. There follows a fight between Holk and Ward which results in Ward being killed.In the course of the closing proceedings, Sergeant Holk, although much affected by his son's confession of homicide, does not falter in his duty.The scenes of the fight between Holk and Ward are so ludicrous that they remind one of a slapstick comedy. The suffering of Holk's mother is also directed with a paucity of imagination.Gustav Froelich gives an earnest portrayal as Policeman Holk. Albert Steinrueck serves the film well as the father. Betty Amann, as Mary, is captivating, but her eye-lashes are made-up as if for the musical comedy stage.

On Thursday night, Mr. Brotzmann promptly unleashed the stinging, shrieking tones that have become legendary both in free jazz and in industrial-noise rock. His tour de force is a sort of polyphonic glissando in which separate scooping lines seem to sound at once. Yet the evening's best moments were its quieter ones: respirations and rustlings intermingled, tremolo figures over a soft drum roll, a pensive three-note melody traded between bass and bass clarinet. Returning refreshed after a long intermission, Mr. Brotzmann dished up broad melody with a punkish sneer, but subtleties soon crept back into the texture.

Even apart from its extramusical association -- Berg regarded it, in part, as a requiem for Manon Gropius, the 18-year-old daughter of his friends Alma Mahler and Walter Gropius -- the concerto conveys with clarity and directness a sense of anguish, world-weary passion and the resilience of hope. All these qualities are furthered, not impeded, by Berg's nontonal language and lush orchestration.   The key to the work is the tension between its currents of sweetness and bitterness. And although one might expect Pinchas Zukerman to lean toward the sweet side of the equation, when he played the work with the Houston Symphony on Monday evening at Carnegie Hall, he maintained the balance carefully. Review/Music","excerpt":"The Sweet, The Bitter, And Berg"},{"year":"2003","title":"THE LIVES OF THE MUSES: Nine Women and the Artists They Inspired, by Francine Prose. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) In her first nonfiction book, Prose assesses a crop of very different women who helped make the alchemy of (male) art possible, from Alice Liddell, the inspirational force behind Lewis Carroll's Wonderland, to the ballerina Suzanne Farrell, who cast a fertile spell on George Balanchine. The author ''has braided these lives together closely and nimbly, so that the whole is even more resonant than the sum of its vibrant parts,'' Stacy Schiff wrote here last year.    SUMMER IN BADEN-BADEN, by Leonid Tsypkin. (New Directions, $13.95.) The author, a Soviet Jewish doctor who died unpublished in 1982, transforms Dostoyevsky into a flawed literary character, conjuring a great writer sensitive to the suffering of others and zealously committed to defending the insulted, unless they happened to be Jewish. The result is an ''extraordinary novel'' that ''participates in the power of Russian literature even as it revises it,'' Jonathan Rose wrote here in 2002.    THE NAVIGATOR OF NEW YORK, by Wayne Johnston. (Anchor, $15.95.) In a bold gambit, this novel inserts its fictional hero, Devlin Stead, into the middle of the bitter competition between Robert E. Peary and Frederick A. Cook to be the first man to reach the North Pole. ''It is through Devlin that we come to understand the beastliness of Peary","excerpt":"the sweet, yet tragically flawed, nature of Cook; and the real crime that lies at the heart of their loathing for each other,'' Kevin Baker said here last year.    THE MEASURE OF ALL THINGS: The Seven-Year Odyssey and Hidden Error That Transformed the World, by Ken Alder. (Free Press, $15.) In 1792, two French astronomers set out in opposite directions across Europe to define a new kind of measuring stick: the meter. According to this novel, their adventures -- ranging from comic to tragic -- were complicated by warfare, hostile mobs, death threats and freak accidents. Alder's ''capable and well-written book . . . adeptly sets its yarn of exploration amid the wider context of a world awakening to the pleasures and perils of scientific exactitude,'' Timothy Ferris wrote here in 2002.    BUSH AT WAR, by Bob Woodward. (Simon & Schuster, $15.) Relying on access to secret documents and high officials (including President Bush and many in his inner circle), Woodward provides an unofficial transcript of 100 days of internal debate over how to oust the Taliban from Afghanistan. His account, which has been updated with material on the administration's deliberations over waging war with Iraq, is ''remarkable,'' Thomas Powers said here last year. In The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History, by Philip Bobbitt (Anchor, $19.95), a scholar analyzes the changes in governance and war over the ages, arguing that the Sept. 11 attacks were an early salvo in a transforming battle over how states are organized and relate to one another. ''Magisterial in its scope and ambition,'' this ''evolutionary map of warfare's impact on the state foreshadows the kind of events still unfolding,'' Edward Rothstein wrote in The Times in 2002.    IGNORANCE, by Milan Kundera. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) Many of Kundera's familiar themes -- betrayal and lost love, the dance between memory and forgetting -- are on display in this novel about a Czech woman who returns to Prague after 20 years in exile, only to find that her friends have no interest in her adopted life in Paris and have moved on from complaints of victimization to the drabber concerns of bourgeois success. The result is an ''erudite and playful'' tale and an ''impassioned account of the &#233;migr&#233; as a character on the stage of European history,'' Maureen Howard wrote here in 2002.    THE BAY OF NOON, by Shirley Hazzard. (Picador, $12.) This novel, originally published in 1970, is set in Italy, mainly in the ancient streets of Naples, where a young Englishwoman slips into a romantic tangle with a Neapolitan writer, a filmmaker and an enigmatic Scottish biologist. The city is drawn ''so perfectly that it seems to breathe,'' according to our reviewer, Robie Macauley.    SANDY KOUFAX: A Lefty's Legacy, by Jane Leavy. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.)

It is all very well to introduce a plain, little girl given to reciting at every opportunity, but constant repetition of such scenes makes this child as annoying to the spectators as she is supposed to be to the visitors in her home. In a number of other stretches Mr. Bell drums home his ideas, when it would have been well for him to remember that Ernest Lubitsch is content to give only a few feet to a masterly stroke.The theme of the narrative is based on a novel by Helen R. Martin. It has possibilities, but Mr. Bell has not made the most of them. On the screen the story is unfolded in such a way as to make the characters unreal. They seem to be devoid of perspicacity—an unthinking lot of puppets merely carrying out the instructions of the director.John Gilbert, who gave splendid performances in \\"His Hour\\" and \\"He Who Gets Slapped,\\" is cast in the rôle of the snob. Eugene Curry, a young sycophant of pleasing appearance who belongs to a country family. He fawns upon those he believes to be socially influential and affluent.Nancy Claxton (Norma Shearer), a young heiress hiding from her own circle of friends because of the disgrace attached to the murder of her father, eventually becomes infatuated with Curry. This seems strange, for although she is ignorant of some of his weaknesses. Curry has certain outstanding disagreeable traits which should have been obvious to this supposedly intelligent young woman.After a long close-up kiss, Curry leaves Nancy and goes to take up a post as a junior professor in a small college, where he meets Herrick Appleton, Nancy's former admirer, who does not know where she is. Curry pompously looks upon Appleton as a striving but unintelligent artist, until he is informed that Appleton belongs to an old Boston family. One would think that even Curry would be a little tactful when he possessed this information. However, he can't resist hurrying to Appleton's studio, where after a few moments he blurts out:\\"So you are one of the Boston Appletons? Why didn't you tell me?\\"This snob then becomes interested in Dorothy Renzheimer, whose grandfather is a power in the college. The giddy girl prevails upon the old man to elevate Curry to the post of headmaster. Curry falls in love with Dorothy and is terribly put out at hearing that Nancy is very ill. He is human enough to go and see her, and soon after one learns that Curry has married Nancy. This is disclosed through a letter written to Dorothy in which Curry says that he was tricked into the marriage. He little knows that he has married a wealthy girl.The pert and comparatively recent graduate from the flapper ranks is wroth, as well she might be. Curry is seen in his home, and the director goes to much trouble to show the indifference to social amenities in that household. The plethoric brother-in-law drinks his coffee from the saucer, and the ill-natured sister is continually scolding her timid offspring. One would imagine that such a girl as Nancy would have thought twice about marrying into such a mannerless family.In spite of his surroundings and what one may justly surmise to be a small emolument for his scholastic duties. Curry succeeds in arraying himself according to the latest vogue of Fifth Avenue or Sackville Street. The expected usually happens in this picture, and also that which one prays won't take place.Miss Shearer is restrained and charming, but as Nancy one can't help thinking that she is conscious of all her virtues. Conrad Nagel, as the hero, is more pleasing than usual, as he indulges in a variation of expressions and is not as gloomy as in most of his previous love-sick rôles. As for Mr. Gilbert's performance, he is too lethargic. A little fire would have made Curry more interesting. Phyllis Haver is capable as Dorothy, who powders her face by the hour and worries over flirting and dancing.This adaptation could have been a really fine screen effort had it been handled by Lubitsch. Chaplin or Buchoweight. As it stands, it is a passing entertainment which ought to be cut in many places to avoid repetitions and long-winded close-ups.

There is clearly something in \\"T. S.

In fact, after viewing this subject, which makes no concessions to the box office, one feels that one would not have it any different to what it is, for this very dilatory pace actually enhances the poetic atmosphere.The suspense is well arranged in most of the scenes, although it is certain that if some stretches had been made in Hollywood the producers there would have taken more advantage of the dramatic moments.After leaving the theatre yesterday afternoon one felt in complete sympathy with a woman who asked the girl at the box office when the picture was going on again that day, as she wished to send a friend there. It is a film without extravagances, one in which the authenticity of the atmosphere is impressive. The leading woman, Enakshi Rama Rao, a Doctor of Philosophy of the \\"University of Madras, may not be as beautiful as she is supposed to be in the story, but that is only through Western eyes. She is, however, a superb actress, who times her movements most competently and invariably reflects just the mood one expects. She plays Selima, who becomes the Empress, and after her death the Emperor causes the Taj Mahal to be erected in her memory. The architect who designs the model for this structure is Shiraz, competently and earnestly played by Himansu Rai, who is, incidentally, responsible for no small part of the technical work of the production.But to continue—Shiraz offered his model, one that was molded by love, for he had been brought up as a child with Selima and was as much in love with her as the Emperor. It was in the days of barbarism, three centuries ago, so on accepting the design the Emperor gives orders to have the architect's eyes put out. They heat the irons. Everything is ready, when the Emperor suddenly is informed that Shiraz is blind, that he made the design, so perfect, that it was at once chosen by the potentate, when sun and moon were alike to his eyes. Shiraz, it is brought out before this, was only loved as a brother by Selima, who gave her heart to the Emperor.An excellent episode deals with Dalia's plot to bring Selima into disfavor with the Emperor. Shiraz, who had haunted the palace, is finally admitted through a forged pass on the day that the Emperor leaves for Delhi. The feline Dalia then sends a courier to let the Emperor know that he can, by returning at once, discover the infidelity of his favorite, Selima, a woman of noble birth.The Emperor returns and, as Dalia had plotted, he finds Shiraz in the palace talking to Selima. Not long afterward Shiraz, then an inconspicuous merchant, is sentenced to die by the foot of an elephant, and it looks as though Selima is to be banished from India. The contrition of a maid, who had aided Dalia and to whom Dalia had given poison, however, is responsible for revealing the treachery of her mistress just before she dies.Shiraz is perceived bound to a wooden harness and near to it are two stakes, one long and the other short. Shiraz is to die by the elephant's foot when the shadows of the two stakes meet. The enormous elephant comes out of an archway, majestically treading in the direction of his victim. The animal is halted, then the mahout goads the pachyderm and it does not look as if Shiraz is going to be saved, although one feels reasonably sure that he will not die by the elephant's foot. As a matter of fact the great foot of the animal is lifted over Shiraz's head at the moment word comes for his release.Seeta Devi, who looks like an Eurasian, gives a meaningful performance as Dalia. Charu Roy is excellent as the Emperor. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Taj Mahal."},{"year":"1975","title":"MIDLAND PARK &#8212","excerpt":"The take&#8208;out menu at the Pantree is small and select.

News of the Camera World"},{"year":"1928","title":"THERE is nothing new under the sun. Icarus was the first aviator and in his courageous attempt to fly to the sun we have a precedent for more recent projects to shoot rockets at the moon. The Chinese invented gunpowder a thousand years ago and the Romans had central heating.Similarly, talking films are over twenty years old. It seems rather hard on Mr. Lasky, their latest discoverer, but as far back as 1907 the film sensation of the year was the \\"chronophone\\" or talking film. The English, who are interested in the past and particularly the past of the motion picture because they claim to have invented it, have lately been indulging in screened reminiscences of the screen's early days. Within the past fortnight two extraordinarily interesting films of considerable chronological value have been trade shown in London. One is called \\"The Evolution of the Film\\" and the other \\"Just Twenty Years Ago.\\" The first is the history of the film industry, the second is—just history.The English, as has been said, claim to have invented the film, and one of their grievances against America is that America will not admit it. In \\"The Evolution of the Film\\" they seek to make their contention good for all time. They show that an Englishman, William Friese-Greene, was the father of all films and are able to quote a United States Supreme Court decision against Thomas Edison and other claimants. It was Friese-Greene who first thought of using a continuous strip of material perforated at the edges so that it could run over sprocket wheels. In 1889 this West Country photographer, whose name—like that of most people connected with the very early history of the film industry—is now scarcely known, made the first film, which was a picture of London traffic at Hyde Park Corner. A few years later, so the record runs, Edison produced his kinetoscope and with it the super-films of that time, which reached the unprecedented length of forty feet.The Talking Films.Lumière was also experimenting in France and had evolved a piece of film mechanism that is still unique, since it was camera, printer and projector combined. It was Lumière who staged in London in 1896 what is claimed to be the first actual exhibition of films. \\"The Evolution of the Film\\" reproduces some of these and they are of remarkable intrinsic as well as historical interest. Among them is a picture—made in 1895—of a train arriving at a Paris station. It is on record that several members of that early audience found this film too realistic and hurriedly left the old Polytechnic, where it was being shown. Film audiences are not so easily impressed today.The film \\"Just Twenty Years Ago\\" is a real proof that the motion picture business is no longer an infant industry, that it is older, in fact, than the generation which makes up the greater part of modern audiences. In this film Englishmen are shown events that happened before they were born. It is a faithful record of representative aspects of the late Victorian and early Edwardian periods. It is interesting, instructive, and forms a basis for excellent comparisons with the times in which we live. As I write, for instance, it is Wimbledon tennis week in London. Miss Helen Wills is hitting as hard and Se∼orita de Alvarez as soon as most men. But twenty years ago we see two highly respectable young females—women were females in those days—decorously patting the ball to each other or gathering up their trailing skirts to take a few mincing steps in pursuit of any return not within arm's length. Any ball that could not be reached without loss of dignity is let alone, and one can imagine the reproachful glance with which this \\"unladylike\\" conduct on the part of the opponent responsible for it was received.The Royal Family.Then again, the ornament of the modern bathing beach clad in thin \\"maillot,\\" or the Channel swimmer attired even more simply in nothing but a coating of grease, is put to shame by a seaside scene which shows how our mothers and fathers did these things in the timid days of old. From cabins on high wheels by the water's edge primly emerge figures clad from neck halfway to ankles in stiff and shapeless serge, generously braided. They proceed with due gravity into the sea, there to bob decorously up and down or perhaps, with costume ballooning a foot above the water, to take a few gasping strokes.Of greater interest is a picture of King Edward, clad in a long cape and setting off on a pony for a day's shooting. A wasp-waisted figure near him is easily identified as Queen Alexandra, an erect and stately girl as the present Queen Mary, and a fourth figure as King George V. then Prince of Wales. Another section of film shows Persimmon winning the Derby for King Edward in 1896. This was incidentally the last royal victory in England's classic racing event. Film patrons of today who were not even old enough to see the great war are taken really far back into history by a picture of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee procession with its columns of British and colonial troops, many of whom afterward fought in the Boer War of twenty-eight years ago.Milton Sills's next starring picture for First National, \\"The Barker,\\" will have sound effects.

The steady annual decline in the number of new cases of tuberculosis in the United States reached a nadir in 1985 (approximately 23,000 cases), and the annual number of new cases has remained approximately constant. The difference between the number of new cases of tuberculosis since 1985 and that projected is thought to be due to infection with the AIDS virus, which leaves the host vulnerable to the development of tuberculosis.

The score is soothing and melodious","excerpt":"the Technicolor is soft and pleasant; the story is agreeable and the actors perform brightly. There is, however, a special quality about the new picture at Loew's State which deserves immediate mention in some detail. That is the polished performance of Fred Astaire as Bert Kalmar, the vaudeville hoofer and magician who became a top-line Tin Pan Alley lyricist, musical comedy author and Hollywood scenarist.Mr. Astaire has been wearing out thin-soled dancing shoes at a great pace over the years while most of us have grown a little heavier and somewhat slower of foot. That he hasn't changed. Still lithe in appearance, Mr. Astaire has drawn rich dividends from time and is dancing at peak form in \\"Three Little Words.\\" His routines in this picture are not as extended or complicated as in some of his previous films, but for pure poetry of motion a skit called \\"Mr. and Mrs. Hoofer\\" would be hard to equal. With Vera-Ellen as his adept spouse, the incomparable Mr. Astaire nimbly demonstrates in dance-pantomine the domestic life of a pair of married dancers. The hyphenated young lady beautifully complements her partner in this imaginative, exquisitely conceived and executed number.Although the story is light as an August breeze, it serves the purpose for which it was intended, to provide some visual accompaniment for the playing of an album of songs. Besides the title tune, these include such long-standing favorites as \\"Nevertheless,\\" \\"Thinking of You,\\" \\"Who's Sorry Now?\\" \\"My Sunny Tennessee\\" and—for good measure, no doubt—there also are \\"Where Did You Get That Girl?\\" and \\"Come on, Papa,\\" which Kalmar and Ruby wrote, respectively, with different associates as composer and lyricist.The George Wells screen play may or may not be accurate as biography, but that seems like a small point under the circumstances. Metro set out to entertain us with \\"Three Little Words,\\" and that it has succeeded in doing with the added help of Red Skelton, who plays Harry Ruby; Arlene Dahl, Keenan Wynn, Gale Robbins and Gloria De Haven. Mr. Skelton is reasonably restrained in this attempt at straight acting, but has ample opportunity to do his familiar clowning in expressing Mr. Ruby's well-known mania for baseball. From the time it starts in 1919 the story runs a familiar course up to the recent present, touching lightly on Kalmar's loss of a promising dancing career due to a knee injury, his great success with Ruby in the popular music field and the misunderstanding which separated them for a time.As musicals go, \\"Three Little Words\\" is the latest thing in simplicity and that is an innovation to be welcomed. In talking of the fine dancing contributed by Mr. Astaire and Vera-Ellen, we forgot to mention how engagingly they also carry off the romantic interest and burst into song when the script demands it. Since Helen (the boop-boop-a-doop girl) Kane rode to fame on \\"I Wanna Be Loved By You,\\" the producers wisely use her voice on the sound track for a production number in which Debbie Reynolds does a nice bit of visual interpretation. Altogether, \\"Three Little Words\\" is a late summer bloom that should even stand the frost of winter.

Mr. Granger, a reporter for a cable-industry magazine, is a foot soldier on one front of the telecommunications revolution: the taming of the busy signal. While not likely to be mourned in the same way as, say, the soda jerk or the downtown movie palace, the old beep-beep-beep, frustratingly familiar since the early days of the medium, is under siege -- a fact that communications experts and sociologists say is loaded with implications about everything from call-waiting etiquette to corporate espionage.

Four centuries later, Virginia Beach isn't snubbed anymore: it's the largest city in Virginia, home to more than 440,000 people and part of a metropolitan area of 1.6 million that includes Norfolk and Newport News. Famous for its naval installations and picturesque shorelines, Virginia Beach also has an eclectic array of famous residents past and present with strong ties to the area: the hip-hop stars Missy Elliott, Tim Mosley (a k a Timbaland), and Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams","excerpt":"the televangelist Pat Robertson; and the legendary psychic Edgar Cayce, who in 1925 was ''called'' to live in this city, with its gentle climate and lush locale along the Atlantic shore.   LISA RICHMON    Friday    4 p.m.  1 -- Kiss Off    If you perch yourself across the street from the Naval Air Station Oceana (757-433-3131, www.nasoceana.navy.mil), you can get a look at what the Navy's top fighter jocks are doing with your tax dollars. After executing a series of aerial combat maneuvers over the ocean, the pilots turn their F/A-18 Hornets and Super Hornets back to the naval station in formation. Then the lead pilot gives the ''kiss off,'' the signal to peel off and land, and the planes simulate a carrier landing by dropping sharply onto a box painted on the runway. You can watch these daily mini-air shows from the jet landing observation area at POW/MIA Flame of Hope Memorial Park (Oceana Boulevard near the intersection with Bells Road).    5:30 p.m.  2 -- Virginia Is for Surfers    Virginia Beach is all about its boardwalk and its clean 100-yard-wide beach. Each August, the area's large surfing community plays host to the annual East Coast Surfing Championship (www.surfecsc.com), North America's oldest running surfing competition (the 44th annual event will be Aug. 23 to 27 by the First Street jetty). The central pier off 15th Street is like a second home to people who live to fish -- and ideal for people who just love to watch.    7 p.m.  3 -- New Southern Cooking    Where once there was Virginia ham, now there is sushi. But while sushi parlors are sprouting up around town like wasabi plants, Walter Mizuno was born and trained as a sushi chef in Tokyo. At the Mizuno Japanese Restaurant (1860 Laskin Road, 757-422-1200), the proprietary salad dressing -- made from 15 undisclosed Asian vegetables -- is sold, when Mr. Mizuno feels like it, for $15 a bottle. The dressing is great over the tuna tartare ($8.75) and the delicately loaded sashimi salad of octopus, crab, avocado, raw tuna or salmon, seaweed, spinach and fresh salad greens ($9.75).    9 p.m.  4 -- Reggae Meets Rugelach    The Jewish Mother is a deli by day and a restaurant and live-music bar by night. John Hammond, Roomful of Blues and Dr. John are among the performers who have played the Jewish Mother (3108 Pacific Avenue; 757-422-5430; www.jewishmother.com); local bands play four or five nights a week. If you're hungry, the Mother's Son Reuben ($8.75) is a specialty of the house, as is, of course, the chicken soup with matzo balls ($4.45).    Saturday    10 a.m.  5 -- Fit to Eat    Virginia Beach is rated the third-fittest city in America by Men's Fitness Magazine. So after you've spent the morning running, power lifting or bear wrestling, you'll have earned the right to eat Grandma's pancakes ($5.29) at Big Sam's Inlet Cafe and Raw Bar (300 Winston Salem Avenue on Rudee Inlet, 757-428-4858). Professional surfers and others in town for competitions are regulars at this beachside restaurant, where a full breakfast menu is offered until 11 a.m.    1:30 p.m.  6 -- Where Ocean Meets Bay    First Landing State Park (2500 Shore Drive; 757-412-2300; www.state.va.us/dcr/parks/1stland.htm) commemorates the spot where, in April 1607, English settlers landed and established an elective government before pushing on to Jamestown. Today, it's the most visited park in Virginia, a cyclists', hikers' and nature lovers' paradise of almost 3,000 acres where the Atlantic Ocean meets the Chesapeake Bay (parking is $2 or $3). Nine walking trails, totaling 19 miles, wind around dunes and ponds surrounded by moss-covered live oak and bald cypress trees. A bike path runs 90 blocks, from Fort Story in the park to Rudee Inlet.    3 p.m.  7 -- Aura of Health    Edgar Cayce was a farm boy from Kentucky who first gained fame in the early 1900's by harnessing his psychic powers to ''enter'' the body of another person. In that state, Cayce would diagnose conditions and offer specific treatments called ''readings.'' Medical readings segued into general predictions of the future (reportedly the stock market crash and World War II), and Cayce gained the attention of scientists, medical experts and President Woodrow Wilson. In 1925, Cayce settled in Virginia Beach and in 1928 founded the Cayce Hospital, where his principles of faith healing were implemented. The hospital closed two years later, but at the Association for Research and Enlightenment, the foundation dedicated to Cayce's legacy (215 67th Street Virginia Beach, 800-333-4499; www.edgarcayce.org), you can browse the gift shop, buy holistic products and attend a day spa that offers Cayce-based home remedies dispensed with the belief that we are all just one session of colon hydrotherapy away from attaining good chi.    7:30 p.m.  8 -- Catch of the Night    For a great view of the scenery of both the natural and Saturday-night varieties, hit Catch 31 Fish House and Bar at the Hilton Virginia Beach Oceanfront (3001 Atlantic Avenue, 757-213-3474). The large glass bar extends outdoors, where it overlooks the boardwalk. Inside, below, the jam-packed grazing area is flanked by two dining areas offering a large selection of fresh fish -- playfully displayed by a waterfall along with a conga line of parrotfish, salmon, red snapper, lobster, crab legs and New Zealand green-lipped mussels -- as well as a raw bar featuring 7 to 13 oyster varieties.    Sunday    9 a.m.  9 -- Eggs on the Veranda    In 1949, before Virginia Beach had a proper hospital, there was Doc Taylor's home office. Today, it's an all-day breakfast and lunch joint (207 23rd Street, 757-425-1960), and the big doses of sunlight that pour into its covered porch are just what the doctor ordered. Breakfasts at Doc Taylor's include the Heart Attack (three eggs, bacon and a chop, $10.95) and the Nurse Ratched (omelet with grilled red peppers, portobellos, spinach and hollandaise, $6.75). Tautog's, the sister cottage next door (No. 205, 757-422-0081), takes over when Doc Taylor's closes at 5 p.m. In warm weather, two decks and a patio with a fish pond and a fountain are open to complement fresh flavor of the shrimp-and-crab-stuffed flounder in a bag ($14.95) or the tuna Martinique ($14.95).    Noon  10 -- Ocean and Marsh    The Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center (717 General Booth Boulevard; 757-425-3474; www.vmsm.com; $11.95, children 3 to 11 $7.95) features a 300,000-gallon tank with sharks and stingrays, an adjacent salt marsh and woodland preserve, and an IMAX theater. Its whale- and dolphin-watching boat tours let you see sea mammals in their natural habitat. The dolphin-watching tours, led by the center's knowledgeable staff, run daily June 10 to Labor Day, then on weekends into October ($18, $16 ages 11 and under; 757-437-2628 for reservations).    2 p.m.  11 -- Virginia Rose    The Norfolk Botanical Garden (6700 Azalea Garden Road; 757-441-5830; www.norfolkbotanicalgarden.org; $6) is in essence a large park brimming with tens of thousands of flowers all year. The botanical garden's 155 lush acres sit right next to Norfolk International Airport, so you can check your bags at the airport and stroll over for a 20-minute tram ride, a 30-minute boat tour on the garden's waterways or an idyll in the butterfly garden, Japanese gardens or statuary vista. During wedding season, you can visit the Bicentennial Rose Garden, where you just might gaze at a bride and the 3,000 rosebushes in 430 varieties that are trying to upstage her.    THE BASICS    Getting to the Sand       Most major airlines fly in and out of Norfolk International Airport. The Virginia Beach oceanfront is less than 30 minutes away by car. A Web search this week found nonstop flights from New York for late June weekends from $335.     One of the newest hotels on the Virginia Beach oceanfront is the Hilton Oceanfront (3001 Atlantic Avenue, 757-213-3001; www.31ocean.com), with a rooftop infinity-edge pool, a sky bar 21 floors up and upscale casual dining at Catch 31 and Salacia. Ocean view and city view rooms range from $279 to $449.     Rooms at the recently renovated Cavalier on the Hill (the area's ''it'' hotel, circa 1930) are $125 to $450 a night. Directly across the street is the modern Cavalier on the Ocean, with poolside and rooftop dining, volleyball, tennis and the area's largest wading pool for kids; rooms there are $185 to $600 (42nd Street and Atlantic Avenue; 757-425-8555; www.cavalierhotel.com).     Barclay Cottage, a 111-year-old Victorian house with wraparound verandas on its two floors, is a bed-and-breakfast two blocks from the beach (400 16th Street, 866-466-1895; www.barclaycottage.com). Guest rooms are stocked with fresh beach towels. A room with a shared bathroom is $144; one with a private bath is $169. 36 Hours in Virginia Beach"},{"year":"1986","title":"SAY this about the World Series: It has been intimate.

Frank Martin's special blend of German post&#8208;romanticism and French tonal sensitivity makes these songs both dramatically powerful and aurally beautiful. They were written in 1943 and are much stronger in construction and effect than the excerpts from &#8220;The Tempest,&#8221; composed 10 years later.

Although the work had little success here, the three excerpts on this disk &#8208;he Overture, Prospero's &#8220;Mein Ariel!&#8221; and &#8220;Hin sind meine Zauberei'n&#8221; (both from Act III) are poetic and lyrical, full of delicacy and imagination. The mood holds up well here as obviously it did not in the full&#8208;length opera. Again Mr. Fischer&#8208;Dieskau gives conviction to his music, and the composer leads fine performances by the Berlin orchestra. The texts are in German, by Hofmannsthal for &#8220;Everyman&#8221; and by Schlegel for &#8220;The Tempest.&#8221; SWISS AND FRENCH MUSIC RECORDED"},{"year":"1923","title":"Temple Emanu-El rents Town Hall TOWN HALL RENTED FOR ROSH HASHANAH","excerpt":"The Temple Emanu-Ef Provides Seats for Strangers for New Year Services."},{"year":"1964","title":"WHITE PLAINS, Aug. 16&#8212","excerpt":"The Temple Israel Center was the setting this afternoon for the marriage of Miss Marion Lee Malkin, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Philip A.

Now the music provides a double escape: into druggy altered perceptions and often back to the fondly remembered 1960's.   Verve, an English band that performed on Friday night at Irving Plaza, makes its acid-rock revival an exercise in purism, harking back to Pink Floyd circa 1968.

They build shelters out of scrap and old tires, eat stockpiled canned food and also use it for barter, and kill weak strangers. For recreation, they go to outdoor enclosures where pornographic movies are shown on an eight-millimeter projector.All this comes under the Good Idea heading. It is a spare, miserable world L. Q. Jones, director, has set up; mean, dry and barren, where everyone wears worn and dirty clothes because there is no way to make new ones and no water to wash with. The future is poverty.Vic, a young man, well-played by Don Johnson, is the protagonist. His companion is Mr. Jones's main Terrible Idea: Blood, a talking dog. There is nothing that can be done in a movie with a dog that talks. After only a few minutes, the old adage is modified to: He doesn't do it very well, and you're not surprised that he's doing it at all.Vic meets a woman, makes love to her, and lets her entice him down into the underground society from which she has emerged. Blood advises against it, and he's right.It is a weird, rural American community, bucolic to all appearances but run as the most savage dictatorship. The dictator is Jason Robards and he's splendid—a kindly, folksy farmer type who gradually becomes as frightening as Heinrich Himmler.Vic runs into all kinds of trouble before the film ends. The underworld part, brilliantly grotesque as it partly is, breaks the realistic vision of the beginning. The two parts don't really work together; their contrast, and a ridiculous ending, shatter the picture. And the talking dog chews up the pieces.This is the second film directed by L. Q.

Officials can't agree on what they agreed to a few weeks earlier. The management is simply chaotic.''

Christy Mathewson obliged with a demonstration of his \\"body swing\\" -- now called a windup -- and Charles M. Conlon embarked on a 38-year career in which he virtually invented the iconography of the national pastime. Through 1942, Conlon (1868-1945) spent his summers carting his bulky Graflex camera (which until 1934 used glass negatives) to various ball parks to capture images of the players in action and in repose -- images so vivid and fresh that \\"ballplayers from another era are standing in the sunshine of the 20th century,\\" as Neal McCabe and Constance McCabe write in BASEBALL'S GOLDEN AGE: The Photographs of Charles M. Conlon (Abrams, $29.95). Conlon remained an amateur photographer -- he was a proofreader at The New York Evening Telegram -- but his avocation made him \\"de facto the official photographer of baseball,\\" one whose visions of the sport were seen annually for decades in Baseball magazine, the annual baseball guides, The Sporting News and baseball textbooks. Conlon once reminisced, \\"The fun I have had, the days in the open, the associations, the confidences I have enjoyed -- well, you can't buy those things.\\" The 205 shots Constance McCabe, a photography conservator, has chosen from the 8,000 surviving Conlon negatives convey the eternally fresh wonder a spectator might feel at being in the open air alongside John McGraw squatting by third base, or watching Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig warm up on the sidelines. Thanks to excellent production, and a brilliant job of design by Carol Robson, great names from the recesses of baseball antiquity come vividly to life, from Honus Wagner, Napoleon Lajoie, Ty Cobb, Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, Frank Chance and Walter Johnson to Grover Cleveland Alexander, Jimmie Foxx, Rogers Hornsby and Tris Speaker. Ms. McCabe's brother, Neal, brought his lifelong enthusiasm for baseball to his research on Conlon and his subjects","excerpt":"the text offers delightful nuggets of information about the innumerable firsts that Conlon recorded: the first American League umpire, the first batter in the World Series, the first photo on a baseball bubble-gum card. \\"Baseball's Golden Age\\" is equally enthralling in image and word and amply illustrates the timeless fascination of the field of dreams.

Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers, addressed the merger convention of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations in New York and laid out major goals for the labor movement.   Unions, he said to enthusiastic applause, must organize the unorganized: workers in the chemical industry, particularly the giant E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company","excerpt":"the textile industry, including plants that had been shifted from the Northeast to the South; construction workers; teachers; white-collar workers, and state and local government workers.   Tomorrow, as 900 A.F.L.-C.I.O. delegates assemble for their first convention in New York in 18 years, they will carry forward the work of a federation that still has failed to achieve most of those goals.  Some Gains, but Short of Goals   While gains have been made in government and teaching, only a small minority of textile, construction and chemical workers belong to unions, and only now is a serious bid being made to organize Du Pont, with a vote set in early December involving 14,000 workers.   Perhaps more important, labor experts say, there is evidence not only that the movement is having trouble organizing workers in the new high-technology industries, but also that labor leaders have little understanding of how to approach the problem.

ON THE MAP;\\nIn Sandyston Township, a Retreat for Craftspeople"},{"year":"2006","title":"SURROUNDED by Grand Teton National Park, among other natural wonders, Jackson, Wyo. (often confused with the wider valley in which it rests, Jackson Hole), has avoided becoming a sprawling tourist trap thanks to its quirk of geography: hemmed in by public land, the town has no room to expand. And the new money drawn here has added cosmopolitan flair, without loss of respect for the town's Old West tradition. Sometimes it seems as if you're as likely to see a Buddhist prayer flag as a pickup truck. Add an ever-expanding list of adventure sports, and you've got a destination that arguably packs more adrenaline, scenery and culture per square mile than anywhere in the country -- even when it isn't ski season.   TOM PRICE    Friday    6 p.m.  1 -- Ouch! And Ouch Again!    Get oriented with a ramble around the town square, which is framed by four arches made from elk horns gathered in nearby forests. Duck into the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar (25 North Cache Street, 307-733-2207) to check out the spur collection and nearly 70 years worth of other accumulated Westernalia. Down the street you'll find what could be called the upside of globalization","excerpt":"the textiles, antiques and jewelry that Davies-Reid (15 East Deloney Avenue, 307-739-1009), above, imports from other mountain regions -- Afghanistan, Tibet, Nepal -- that seamlessly complement Wyoming's Western aesthetic.    7:30 p.m.  2 -- Try the Stuffed Buffalo    After posing with the stuffed buffalo outside, climb the steps to the Snake River Grill (84 East Broadway, 307-733-0557). It's one of Jackson's best-known restaurants -- reservations are recommended -- and the menu is kept dynamic while maintaining worthy traditions; witness the inspired crispy pork shank in red chili sauce over roasted corn and black bean salsa ($27) as a complement to the grill's usual, and delightful, Caesar salad ($9). And be sure to have a glass of Domaine Carneros pinot noir ($16). After dinner, stroll north, toward the National Elk Refuge, which abuts town. Once there, you may find southbound geese asleep on the grass roof of the visitors center. Away from the lights and neon, you'll have a striking view of the night sky.    Saturday    9 a.m.  3 -- And Wear a Helmet    Get fitted for a mountain bike at Hoback Sports (520 West Broadway, 307-733-5335; www.hobacksports.com), grab a trail map ($12) and start pedaling; the rental is $40 a day for a full-suspension bike. Storm east toward the 20-mile Cache Creek-Game Creek loop through the Bridger Teton National Forest. Take either the smooth dirt road or the parallel single-track Putt-Putt Trail, winding along a shaded stream. At the Game Creek turnoff, crank up a short steep climb, and you'll be rewarded with a five-mile descent down sage- and aspen-covered hills before connecting with a paved path back to town.    Noon  4 -- Picnic With the Tetons    For all its worldliness, Jackson is a tiny town of about 8,600 full-time residents. Grab picnic fixings at Harvest Organic Bakery & Cafe (130 West Broadway, 307-733-5418), then a side order of scenery at Snow King Resort (corner of Snow King Avenue and King Street, 307-733-5200), the in-town ski area. Hike the piney switchbacks 1.8 miles and 1,571 vertical feet to the summit (45 minutes if you're huffing, but remember you're starting at 6,200 feet). The view stretches 50 miles to Yellowstone, and it's the best place in the valley to see both the town and the Tetons.    2:30 p.m.  5 -- Drive-By Shooting    Relax with a behind-the-wheel wander through Grand Teton National Park ($25 for a week's auto pass, also valid at Yellowstone National Park; 307-739-3300; www.nps.gov/archive/grte/home.htm). Best bet for scenic snaps: loop north on Route 191 past the Snake River Overlook, where you can frame the river that carved the valley and the mountains behind in one shot, then head south along Teton Park Road past Jenny Lake. On your way back, stop at Dornan's in the town of Moose (200 Moose Street, 307-733-2415) for cocktails on the deck, about as close as you can get to the Tetons and still have someone bring you a drink.    7:30 p.m.  6 -- Thai, Even Here    While wandering over to Teton Thai (135 North Cache Street, 307-733-0022), a hole-in-the-wall at the end of a boardwalk, pick up a copy of The Jackson Hole Daily, which is free. It's your best guide to night life, and it'll help pass the time -- locals happily wait 30 minutes for the restaurant's stuffed chicken wings ($6.95) and Tom Ka Gai coconut soup ($5.95). Still need convincing? Consider: When Calista Flockhart wanted a caterer for Harrison Ford's birthday party, Teton Thai got the call.    10 p.m.  7 -- Of Ale and the Dobro    Locals crowd in fleece by jowl at the nearby Mangy Moose Restaurant and Saloon (Teton Village, Village Road, 307-733-4913; www.mangymoose.net) because it's the only place a long way around to see nationally known musical acts. This month, for example, Breakestra is scheduled to appear at the Moose, as are the Melvins; and last month, the bluegrass dobro master Jerry Douglas played there. So, order a draft Snake River Pale Ale ($4) and elbow into a seat at the bar -- no matter who's playing.    Sunday    7:30 a.m.  8 -- Green Bagels    Join local residents lining up for the best coffee in town at Pearl Street Bagels (145 West Pearl Avenue, 307-739-1218). Purists, rejoice; even after pranksters nailed a dozen toasters to Pearl Street's pink facade a few years ago, the bagelry still serves its bagels warm from the oven but untoasted. Splurge on a quad latte ($5). Sales benefit the 1 Percent for the Tetons group (www.onepercentforthetetons.org), dedicated to preserving the region's natural resources.    9 a.m.  9 -- So Long, Big Red Box    If the caffeine didn't get you going, this ride will. From the Teton Village base, the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort tram ($17, 307-733-2292) will whisk you up 4,139 feet to the summit of Rendezvous Mountain. (Pack a jacket -- it can be gorgeous in the valley, but snowing up top.) Coming down, press against the front window for a stomach-dropping pass over the skier's jump known as Corbet's Couloir, but do it before Oct 1. After 40 years, and an estimated nine million riders, the beloved ''Big Red Box'' is retiring (a replacement is in the works for 2008).    10 a.m.  10 -- The Compleat Angler    Luxury has its perks. While other fishing guides are still helping customers fill out their license and soft-selling flies, Ryan Peterson, director of fishing for the Four Seasons Resort (Teton Village, 307-732-5000; www.fourseasons.com/jacksonhole), will have already launched the resort's handmade wooden dory, with your permit in hand, rods assembled and flies tied. After navigating down one of the secluded braids of the Snake River, put that extra time and his expert advice to use reeling in some of the Snake's 2,500 fish per mile. And first-timers are welcome; Mr. Peterson so easily juggles beginners and cast-masters that he says he has been able to maintain an unbroken eight-year streak of clients' landing fish. On a recent trip, two novice 8-year-old girls each landed a half-dozen cutthroat trout. A full-day's outing for two people, riverside lunch and all gear included, is $700.    4 p.m.  11 -- There's the Rub    Jackson is chockablock with spas, but the first, the Body Sage Day Spa at the Rusty Parrot Lodge (175 North Jackson Street, 307-733-4455; www.bodysage.com), remains a favorite, in part because of its extensive use of local herbs and minerals. The best betafter your decathlon-worthy outing: 15 minutes under a eucalyptus steam tent on a massage table, followed by a candle-lit massage with oil infused with locally harvested arnica, which carries away the ache and speeds recovery for overused muscles -- making them nice and fit for the coming workweek. The whole thing takes an hour and is $115.    THE BASICS    Down (Comforters) In the Valley       FLIGHTS into Jackson Hole are expensive hops from Chicago, Dallas, Denver or Salt Lake City, but the landing -- right in the middle of Grand Teton National Park -- is worth it. You will want a rental car.      The rustic-y Cowboy Village Resort (120 South Flat Creek Drive, 800-962-4988; www.townsquareinns.com) has two-room, two-bed cabins from $182.      Opened last summer, Homewood Suites by Hilton (260 North Millward Street, 307-739-0808; www.jacksonwy.homewoodsuites.com), is also one of the most convenient; the lobby sells forgotten items like sunscreen and batteries, and every floor has free clothes washers and dryers; $305 a night for a suite with two doubles and a kitchenette.     The top of East Gros Ventre Butte is a fitting site for the ultradeluxe Amangani Resort (1535 Northeast Butte Road, 307-734-7333; www.amanresorts.com). Even if you're not staying in one of the 40 redwood-appointed rooms, drop by for a drink overlooking the infinity pool, and catch one of the best sunset views in the valley; $750 a night, and way up. 36 Hours in Jackson, Wyo."},{"year":"1944","title":"CHUNGKING, China, Oct. 21 (AP) -- A Fourteenth United States Air Force communique:   Article 5 -- No Title","excerpt":"The Texts of the Day's Communiques on Fighting in Various Zones"},{"year":"1943","title":"text Russian","excerpt":"The Texts of the Day's Communiques on the Fighting in Various War Zones"},{"year":"1944","title":"Yesterday's communique, as broadcast from Moscow to the Soviet Union and reported by the Federal Communications Commission:   Russian","excerpt":"The Texts of the Day's Communiques on the War"},{"year":"1943","title":"French communique 197, as broadcast to French areas by the United Nations radio in Algiers and reported by Federal Communications Commission monitors:   French","excerpt":"The Texts of the Day's War Communiques"},{"year":"1943","title":"Yesterday's early operational bulletin, as broadcast from Moscow to the Soviet Union and reported by the Federal Communications Commission:   Russian","excerpt":"The Texts of the Day's War Communiques"},{"year":"1944","title":"British","excerpt":"The Texts of the Day's War Communiques"},{"year":"1941","title":"BERLIN, June 9 (AP) -- The German High Command issued this communique today:   German","excerpt":"The Texts of the War Communiques"},{"year":"1954","title":"Following is the text of a statement by Senator Joseph R.

Priestley's ''Edwardians,'' Edith Wharton's ''Fruit of the Tree,'' ''Scenery for the Theater'' and ''La Belle Epoque'' - enough, in fact, to fuel the unconscious of six actors.\\n\\nFor Miss Bolton is branching out, trying her hand at directing, and since the play is ''An Inspector Calls,'' Mr. Priestley's searing mystery melodrama set in Edwardian England, her research calls for steeping herself - and she hopes, her actors - in the nuances of that era.

Its latest, in Oxford, is housed in the city's former prison, an imposing Victorian building with an entrance only slightly less grand than that of Oxford Castle (which dates to the 11th century) next door. Most of the rooms are in converted cells that flank two sides of the huge central atrium, a show-stopping space that rises three stories and is crisscrossed by narrow walkways that make it the perfect venue for a large-scale prison riot.    THE LOCATION -- The hotel is on New Road, a five-minute walk from both the train station and most of the historic city center sights. Skip the soulless chain restaurants in the recently renovated castle grounds and walk east over the Cherwell River to hang out with the students along Cowley Road, a down-to-earth stretch of bars and cheap African and Asian restaurants.    THE ROOMS -- Judging by the low, barrel-vaulted ceiling, my standard room amounted to two cells knocked together, with a third for the bathroom. It was bigger than it sounds. The almost-out-of-reach slot windows, exposed brickwork and scuffed metal door harked back to the building's former function","excerpt":"the thick carpet, comfortable armchair, tasteful photographs of local gargoyles and the soft queen-size bed, stacked high with cushions, were obviously more recent additions. The stylish surroundings were marred only by the view through a dirty window of a litter-strewn yard. The resolutely dim lighting is perfect when you're in decadent mode, frustrating when you're scrabbling around for a lost key card.    THE BATHROOM -- The lighting is just as dim, but with a whole wall of mirrors, that could be a good thing. The under-floor heating, a towel rack as toasty as the coil in an electric kettle, and a hot, big-headed shower all conspire to make things a little stuffy. There's plenty of space for a freestanding bathtub, as big as an ark. Nonetheless, I didn't expect it to come with its own built-in flood: around midnight, biblical torrents of water suddenly erupted from somewhere underneath, and the bathroom was quickly a lake. I wondered if I was destined to embark on a great voyage and was about to climb aboard the tub when a team of embarrassed staff arrived, responding to my distress call. In the end I traveled only as far as the other side of the hotel, to be upgraded to a suite.    AMENITIES -- All rooms have free high-speed Internet access, flat-screen television and DVD player. There is a small gym, called the Exercise Yard. Downstairs is a smart if unmemorable bar, and a restaurant where jovial waiters serve excellent food to bad, clubby music. All the design flourishes have been saved for the Visitors' Room, a dark den done up in greens, purples and tartan, with a comically high bookcase, a billiard table and every spare surface embossed with a chessboard.    ROOM SERVICE -- A basket, filled with cereal, pastries, butter and jam, fresh orange juice, fruit salad and yogurt, was delivered promptly at 9 a.m., for about £10 ($17.80 at $1.78 to the pound).    THE CROWD -- Oxford students with very good upbringings were in their element in the Visitors' Room, which to them must seem like a heavenly junior common room.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- The Malmaison is a comfortable, stylish stay in a great location. A few glitches in the service: there was no record of my reservation when I arrived, and I almost didn't notice I was being overcharged as I checked out. Rooms start at £140 pounds (about $250) while suites are £195 (about $350) and up -- check the Web site for bargains. But the suites are not in converted cells, and mine lacked the quirky details that made my original room (£160) so appealing.

Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE CAINE MUTINY COURT-MARTIAL' An eye-glazing attempt to resurrect Herman Wouk's 1953 courtroom drama, adapted from his novel ''The Caine Mutiny.'' Directed with metronome in hand by Jerry Zaks, and starring David Schwimmer, Tim Daly and Zeljko Ivanek, this workmanlike production gives few clues to the enduring appeal of Mr. Wouk's tale of a humdinger of a typhoon, some disappearing strawberries and a nut job memorably named Queeg (2:15). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scène remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' Madly enjoyable. Alan's Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HOT FEET'  A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LESTAT'  A musical sleeping pill, adapted from Anne Rice's ''Vampire Chronicles'' and featuring songs by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, that could well give the makers of Ambien a run for their money. Dare to look upon this tale of the undead and keep your eyelids from growing heavier and heavier and heavier (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, near 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke syntheziers, where kids can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice-versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THREE DAYS OF RAIN'  (2:30). In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka)    'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)    'BRUNDIBAR' and 'BUT THE GIRAFFE, A CURTAIN RAISER TO HANS KRASA'S 'BRUNDIBAR' Hans Krasa's ''Brundibar,'' a lively opera for children, performed 55 times in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, with a new English libretto by Tony Kushner and a curtain-raiser by him that explains its history. Maurice Sendak and Kris Stone designed the charming production (1:35). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO'  The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts. (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell)    'THE CONTRAST' Royall Tyler's slender 1787 romantic comedy -- one of the first professional American plays ever produced -- should be of more interest to historians than to theatergoers (2:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)    'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Scott Ellis's underpowered production of Joe Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which stars Alec Baldwin in a comedy sketch of a performance, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'FAUST, PARTS 1 AND 2' David Herkskovits and his Target Margin Theater's remarkable performers offer the extravaganza promised in the publicity. Faust is a circus of operatic scale, a fun house, a tango of poetry and theatrical and sonic wizardry whose virtuosity renders this work in all its surging strangeness, power and extravagant beauty (6:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Honor Moore)    'A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE' This musical, based on a 1960 novel by Peter S. Beagle, tells of love in a cemetery that sounds a lot like Woodlawn in the Bronx. One set of would-be lovebirds is living, one recently deceased","excerpt":"the thin story needs a few more memorable songs. York Theater, St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY'  This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion. Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)    'MARY STUART' An earnest but uninspired revival that never quite captures either the romance or the tragedy of Schiller's play. There are some bright spots, but the production appears aimed more at visual effect than dramatic substance, and both queens seem to have the idea that monarchs exert authority simply by speaking loudly (2:40). The Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Wilborn Hampton)    'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SORE THROATS' Howard Brenton's scabrous 1979 drama about the bilious aftermath of a British marriage. Laila Robins and Bill Camp are a middle-aged, newly divorced couple warring over the past and the future. The play's insights into the irreducible conflict between human needs and the constraints of civilization are a little murky (2:10). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'GAUGUIN/SAVAGE LIGHT' George Fischoff, whose musical résumé includes a few pop hits from the 1960's (''Lazy Day,'' ''98.6''), does everything here: book, lyrics, music, piano playing. His young cast has a lot of energy, and Jeff Nardone as Paul Gauguin shows off a great voice, but the biographical treatment of this artist is too superficial (1:10). The Studio at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10).

(Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100.

(Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closing Sunday. (Hunka)    'THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST'  Lynn Redgrave is an unusually vigorous Lady Bracknell in Sir Peter Hall's new production of Oscar Wilde's peerless comedy from 1895. A satisfactory production that works effectively as a romantic farce but more erratically as a vehicle for Wilde's paradox-perfumed wit. (2:25) Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    * 'RELATIVITY' Cassandra Medley's play, the main offering of the First Light festival of science-themed works, offers plenty of food for thought about the uses and abuses of genetic science, but it offers fringe benefits as well: a couple of scalding scenes, and fine performances by Melanie Nicholls-King as a young black scientist who comes to question the black-superiority theories of her mother, and Petronia Paley as the noted researcher who takes her under her wing (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)    * 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying. (Dana Stevens)    'AN AMERICAN HAUNTING' (PG-13, 83 minutes) Things go bump in the night in this 19th-century ghost story, but it's the bump of emptying seats, as audiences flee in boredom, that will haunt you for days. (Nathan Lee)    'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time, they plod through a grouchy attack on -- and example of -- the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (A. O. Scott)    * 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Stephen Holden)    * 'THE DEATH OF MR. LAZARESCU' (R, 154 minutes, in Romanian) This Romanian film follows the grueling final hours of an ailing, alcoholic 62-year-old man in Bucharest, as he is shuttled among four city hospitals. A sustained triumph of ensemble acting, the film seems so absolutely real that it absorbs you into its world in the same way that a documentary like Frederick Wiseman's ''Hospital'' seeps into your consciousness. (Holden)    * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-Western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson, its writer and director, flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)    'GUYS AND BALLS' (R, 106 minutes, in German) In the German soccer comedy ''Guys and Balls,'' a baker's son (Maximilian Brückner) who is gay forms an all-gay team to defeat his hometown homophobes. Groaning with double-entendres and flaming gay stereotypes, the movie's climactic game offers some of the most sustained -- and literal -- gay bashing in movie history, even if the outcome is no more surprising than that of any other underdog comedy.Adam Sandler is probably already in training. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'HOOT' (PG, 90 minutes) Fourteen-year-old Roy Eberhardt is the new kid in the tiny Florida beach town of Coconut Cove. When he discovers that a local construction site is threatening the habitat of an endangered species of owls, Roy teams up with two local kids (Cody Linley and Brie Larson) to sabotage the building project, incurring the wrath of a national restaurant chain and baffling a clueless local cop named Officer Delinko (Luke Wilson). (Stevens)    * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Manohla Dargis)    'LADY VENGEANCE' (R, 111 minutes, in Korean) Park Chanwook completes his ''vengeance trilogy'' with this kinder, gentler exercise in pulp pyrotechnics and empty virtuosity. (Lee)    * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)    'THE LOST CITY' (R, 143 minutes) Andy Garcia's ode to the Havana of pre-Communist Cuba is a romantic epic manqué that swoons across the screen for nearly 2 1/2 hours without saying much beyond the fact that life sure was peachy before Fidel Castro came to town and ruined everything. (Holden)    'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)    * 'THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE' (R, 91 minutes) With the help of her charmingly enthusiastic star, Gretchen Mol, the director Mary Harron unwraps the great 1950's pinup queen Bettie Page, who for years was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. (Dargis)    'THE PROMISE' (PG-13, 103 minutes, in Mandarin) A lavish spectacle -- somewhere between grand opera and cartoon -- from Chen Kaige, about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess. Sometimes breathtaking, sometimes out of breath. (Scott)    * 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Lee)    * 'THREE TIMES' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Mandarin and Taiwanese dialect) For this hypnotically beautiful cinematic trilogy, the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, one of the modern masters of the art, brings us love and loss in three different time periods. (Dargis)    'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)    * 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis)    'THE WHORE'S SON' (No rating, 86 minutes, in German) Michael Sturminger's unsentimental German-language debut feature fearlessly plumbs the depths of an intense mother-son relationship, in which Ozren (appearing at ages 3, 8 and 16) becomes more aware, as the years pass, that his beloved mother, Silvija, is a high-class prostitute. (Laura Kern)    'THE WILD' (G, 94 minutes) Filled with softness and texture, ''The Wild'' follows Samson the lion (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) as he escapes from the zoo to rescue his cub, who has stowed away on a ship bound for Africa. With inspired voice work from Eddie Izzard as a pukka koala and William Shatner as a menacing wildebeest, the movie also finds time to explore the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. (Catsoulis)    Film Series    ROBERT ALTMAN (Through June 8) This weekend's films at the Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work include ''Nashville'' (1975), the director's comment on the marriage of show business and politics; two episodes of ''Tanner '88,'' the pseudodocumentary mini-series with Michael Murphy as a golden but fictional presidential candidate; and ''Popeye'' (1980), with Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Anita Gates)    B-NOIR (Through June 15) Film Forum's six-week festival of 70 low-budget American thrillers from the 1940's and 50's continues this weekend with two double features. The two Nicholas Ray films are ''They Live by Night'' (1949), with Farley Granger as a young escaped convict, and ''On Dangerous Ground'' (1952), starring Robert Ryan as a hardened city cop and Ida Lupino as the blind sister of a murder suspect. ''The Window'' (1949) is about a little boy who witnesses a murder in his upstairs neighbors' apartment, and ''The Web'' is a melodrama starring Edmond O'Brien as a bodyguard who kills a man, and Vincent Price as his not entirely honest employer. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates)    BICYCLE FILM FESTIVAL (Through Sunday) Anthology Film Archives is playing host to this annual event. The bicycle-themed features include Jacob Septimus and Anthony Howard's ''B.I.K.E.,'' a profile of the Black Label Bicycle Club that includes scenes of tall-bike jousting; Mike Martin and Gabe Morford's ''M.A.S.H.,'' about fixed-gear riding in San Francisco; and Peter Sutherland's ''Pedal,'' a documentary about the harrowing lives of New York bicycle messengers. 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village; $8.50 (online, $10.50). Free valet bike parking. (Gates)    KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's weekend series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues this weekend with ''Ran'' (1985), the director's award-winning interpretation of ''King Lear.'' The New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Society of Film Critics and National Board of Review all named it best foreign film. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates)    REDISCOVERING ROSCOE: THE CAREER OF FATTY ARBUCKLE (Through Monday) The Museum of Modern Art's 54-film retrospective of the acting and directing career of the scandal-ridden Arbuckle (1887-1933) concludes with three ''Directing After the Scandal'' programs, including 1920's silents that Arbuckle directed under the name William Goodrich, and a career-recap program that includes a tinted print of ''Fatty and Mabel Adrift'' (1916). (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)    SUNDANCE INSTITUTE AT BAM (Through May 21) The Brooklyn Academy of Music is celebrating the Sundance Institute's 25th anniversary with a series of events, including screenings of films from this year's Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The opening-weekend selections include ''The Short Life of José Antonio Gutierrez,'' a documentary about the first United States casualty in the war in Iraq; ''Stephanie Daley,'' a drama about a pregnant forensic psychologist and a teenage girl accused of infanticide, starring Tilda Swinton and Amber Tamblyn; ''TV Junkie,'' a documentary special jury prize winner; and ''Son of Man,'' which transposes Jesus' life to modern-day South Africa. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $10.

ANGELS AND AIRWAVES (Monday and Tuesday) With Blink-182, superstars of boys-will-be-boys pop-punk, apparently defunct, its singer, Tom DeLonge, has put together a new band featuring members of Offspring and the Distillers. The band, sounding lean, aggressive and surprisingly sincere on its new album, ''We Don't Need to Whisper'' (Geffen), makes its New York debut. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Ben Sisario)    ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI (Thursday) If the musical segments on ''Sesame Street'' were made with a chamber orchestra and choir and intended for an audience of hyperintelligent prodigies, they might sound something like this Australian group: sunny, frolicsome and inventive, as if every instrument were being played for the first time.

(Sisario)    * ART BRUT (Wednesday and Thursday) Rock 'n' roll needs to celebrate as well as ridicule its own mythology, and Art Brut, sarcastically but exuberantly singing about the thrill of plugging in and making a ruckus -- ''Formed a band, we formed a band/Look at us, we formed a band!'' -- is one of the rare groups that can do both. The band has programmed two nights of music on two stages at the Knitting Factory, with Think About Life, the Chalets, the Robocop Kraus and others.

At 8 p.m., New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $39.50. (Sisario)    DEPECHE MODE, GOLDFRAPP (Tomorrow) As in their 1980's heyday, Depeche Mode set pouting vocals against catwalk electronica that belies the music's blues-rock origins. The formula still works pretty well; one descendant is the duo Goldfrapp, led by Allison Goldfrapp, a techno glamourpuss part Marlene Dietrich and part Debbie Harry. At 8 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000 or (212) 307-7171; $35 and $85.

At 7:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario)    ICE CUBE (Tonight) Better known nowadays for his regular-joe-from-the-hood film roles, Ice Cube has long been said to be working on a new rap album that will take him back to the unflinching social commentary and provocation of his early solo material and his work with N.W.A.

At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $28; $18 for students and 65+. (Sisario)    CHRISTIAN MARCLAY (Wednesday) In the artworks and performances of Christian Marclay, pop music is not just a sound but also a collection of visual material -- vinyl discs, metal instruments, frangible leafs of sheet music -- that can be rearranged and remixed. For this performance, his film collage ''Screen Play'' will serve as a score to be interpreted live by two trios, one led by the veteran experimental guitarist Elliott Sharp, and the other by the cellist Okkyung Lee. At 8 p.m., Courtyard Gallery, World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free, but tickets, available at 5 p.m., are required.

At 8 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or (212) 307-7171; sold out tonight and tomorrow; $30 at the door on Sunday; $20 in advance. (Sisario)    MOGWAI (Tonight and tomorrow) Mogwai plays slow-motion pieces: three or four chords that meditate or build inexorably, with touches of dissonance and, perhaps, a conversation or an under-the-breath vocal attached.

At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Pareles)    * 'NEW VOICES FROM JAPAN' (Tonight and tomorrow night) None of them are new, but the three avant-garde musicians gathered here by John Zorn are among the most fearlessly original and jaw-droppingly intense performers on the planet. Yamataka Eye is known for his endurance screaming and manic cartoon vocalizations with the Boredoms; Haino Keiji, of Fushitsusha, brings dark clouds of noise out of guitars and sometimes a hurdy-gurdy; and Makigami Koichi, the third visitor, is the leader of the long-running group Hikashu, which has played everything from techno to jazz. This is an extremely rare convergence, not to be missed. At 7:30, Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258; $30 and $35. (Sisario)    GENERAL PATTON VS. THE X-ECUTIONERS (Sunday) Mike Patton, the former singer of Faith No More, is one of the most versatile vocalists around -- which is to say that he can holler, squeal, croon and make like an operatic tenor or Daffy Duck with just about anyone. Here he meets a worthy opponent in several members of the X-ecutioners, the virtuosic D.J. crew that made record-scratching a sport. At 9 p.m., 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25 in advance, $30 at the door.

The group begins a special two-night engagement at Radio City Music Hall, serving as both the headliner and the house band for a roster of rap heroes including, on this night, Nas, Common and Talib Kweli. At 8 p.m., (212) 307-7171; $50 to $70. (Sisario)    SAM CHAMPION (Thursday) This local four-piece derives its shambolic jangle from Pavement, singing about being ''aggressively lazy'' -- the aggression comes in tense, muscular jabs of guitar that recall Neil Young. With the Comas, the Big Sleep and the Self Righteous Brothers. At 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. (Sisario)    SOULFLY (Tonight) In Sepultura, the Brazilian singer Max Cavalera roared over dark, churning heavy-metal chords that sounded almost as guttural as his voice.

At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $25.

(Tommasini)    Classical Music    * BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday) This floating concert hall's highlight this weekend is an all-Hindemith program tomorrow and Sunday with some big players, including the Rhodes family (the violist Samuel Rhodes and the violinist Hiroko Yajimi, and their violinist daughter Harumi Rhodes) and the pianist Gilbert Kalish. Tonight's offering is a piano recital by Randall Hodgkinson. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35 tonight; $40 tomorrow and Sunday; $25 for students. (Midgette)    * IAN BOSTRIDGE (Tomorrow) This British tenor began his expansive and adventurous Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall in March with a stunning program of works by Britten. He concludes it tomorrow, joined by the elegant German soprano Dorothea Röschmann, with a tribute to Robert Schumann on the 150th anniversary of his death. Songs from the ''Myrthen'' collection will be performed, as well as eight seldom-heard duets, accompanied by the pianist Julius Drake. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800; $40 and $48, with limited availability. (Tommasini)    BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) This scrappy and usually interesting orchestra features two programs this weekend: first, Elvis Costello, who appears tonight as both orchestral composer (with a suite from ''Il Sogno'') and singer (with his own songs); second, a range of American music by Leonard Bernstein (the ''Jeremiah'' Symphony), Daniel Bernard Roumain (his ''Hip-Hop Essay'') and Thea Musgrave (the premiere of ''Remembering Harriet,'' a suite from her Harriet Tubman opera). At 8, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $25 to $80 tonight; $20 to $60 tomorrow. (Midgette)    CONCERTANTE (Thursday) This versatile chamber ensemble concludes its season with a concert of works by Mozart, Mendelssohn and Copland. Alexander Fiterstein (clarinet) and Xak Bjerken (piano) join as guest artists. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20. (Eichler)    * DBR AND THE MISSION (Tonight) The composer Daniel Bernard Roumain lives in several musical worlds, although to his way of thinking, they're all one, with manifestations that range from hip-hop to string quartets and symphonic works. His program at the Kitchen includes works for string quartet and laptop, for solo violin and for his electric chamber-funk band, the Mission. At 8, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793; $10. (Allan Kozinn)    * EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Sunday) Among the great composers of the 20th century, Shostakovich was the most inscrutable. But in his 15 string quartets he came closest to showing his hand. These works are like entries in a diary, and he never imagined that they would become as popular as they are today. The Emerson Quartet plays these seminal works compellingly and has recorded them complete. They have been performing them all, in chronological order, and this is the final concert, with Quartets Nos. 13, 14 and 15. At 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $60. (Tommasini)    DMITRI HVOROSTOVSKY (Wednesday) This dashing Russian singer turns to the music he knows best, from Glinka and Borodin to Medtner and Rachmaninoff. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $48. (Holland)    LOS ANGELES GUITAR QUARTET (Tomorrow) Ensemble music for the classical guitar is notoriously tricky, if only because imperfectly unanimous attacks sound unduly chaotic. This ensemble plays with spectacular precision and offers a varied program that ranges from Renaissance works of Thomas Morley and transcriptions of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 and Copland's Two Mexican Pieces, to recent scores by Alfonso Montes, William Kanengiser, Andrew York and Vince Mendoza. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $40. (Kozinn)    MET ORCHESTRA (Sunday) The conductor James Conlon takes over for the injured James Levine in a program of Mozart, Tchaikovsky and assorted arias. Erika Sunnegardh, Ben Heppner and René Pape are the singers. At 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $46 to $155.(Holland)    MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO (Tonight) At the Marlboro Music School and Festival in Vermont, young musicians spend the summer with their more accomplished older colleagues, and to keep the spirit alive, ensembles of students and teachers tour during the season. This 2005-6 season, the Marlboro touring program is celebrating its 40th anniversary, and its series at the Met ends with a program of Mozart, Schumann and Schoenberg. At 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Kozinn)    CHARLES NEIDICH AND CAROL WINCENC (Tonight) The Naumburg Foundation gave this clarinetist and this flutist prestigious awards earlier in their careers, and now presents them in a shared recital. Mr. Neidich is playing clarinet works by Berg and Schumann, as well as his own composition, and Ms. Wincenc is performing music for flute by Enescu, Fauré, Lukas Foss and others. Stephen Gosling joins on piano. At 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Eichler)    NEW AMSTERDAM SINGERS (Thursday) Clara Longstreth, the music director of the estimable New Amsterdam Singers, once again shows her knack for fresh programming with a concert titled ''Invitation to the Voyage: Fifty Years of American Song.'' The evening offers choral settings of poetry from Solomon to Octavio Paz by composers including John Corigliano, Daniel Pinkham, Eric Whitacre, Ned Rorem and others. At 8, Immanuel Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 88th Street, (212) 842-1511; $20; $15 for 65+; $10 for students. (Tommasini)    PRISM CONCERTS (Sunday) Judith Clurman conducts ''Grappling with Their Heritage,'' a program of works by composers born into Jewish families, specifically Mendelssohn, Mahler and Castelnuovo-Tedesco. Performers include the soprano Deborah Voigt, the pianist Brian Zeger, the organist Colin Fowler and the Claremont Trio. At 7 p.m., Central Synagogue, Lexington Avenue at 55th Street, (212) 581-0400; $25. (Eichler)    DAVID ROBERTSON (Thursday) The American conductor and a various group called the Zankel Band play Berio, Ligeti and George Benjamin. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35. (Holland)    ST. THOMAS CHOIR (Tuesday) This finely polished choir of men and boys, conducted by John Scott, gives several superb concerts every season, with support from the period-instrument orchestra Concert Royal. The last for this year is devoted to Bach, with the Cantatas Nos. 106 and 118, and a motet from the ''Easter Oratorio.'' The soloists are Jolle Greenleaf, soprano; Robert Isaacs, countertenor; David Vanderwal, tenor; and Richard Lippold, bass. At 7:30 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360; $25 to $60. (Kozinn)    KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ (Sunday) The TriBeCa New Music Festival continues this weekend with a piano recital, if you can call it that, by the boundary-busting Kathleen Supové. There are avant-garde works by Randall Woolf, Julia Wolfe and John King, as well as ''Body of Your Dreams'' by Jacob ter Veldhuis, a multimedia piece built around the soundtrack of an exercise video. The most unusual selection looks to be ''Delta Space'' by Lukas Ligeti, which features the pianist in competition with a Yamaha Disklavier (a sort of super-high-tech player piano), fighting over the same keyboard. At 7 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, (212) 352-3101; $15. (Tommasini)    CAMILLA TILLING (Tonight) This gifted, lovely and appealing Swedish lyric soprano has been making the rounds of the world's major opera companies in recent years, including performances as Verdi's Nannetta and Mozart's Zerlina at the Met. Here she presents a recital with the pianist Julius Drake. Her program offers Nordic songs by Stenhammar, Sibelius and Grieg, as well as works by Strauss and Schubert. At 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $32. (Tommasini)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    * 'BRINGING BALANCHINE BACK' (Sunday) This 2003 film records a visit by the New York City Ballet to St. Petersburg, George Balanchine's birthplace, where the company participated in the ''White Nights Festival'' and helped to celebrate the city's 300th anniversary. The program also includes Ulrik Wivel's ''I You Love/Jeg Dig Elsker,'' a short film, with Nikolaj Hubbe, about the mime and dramatic meaning of August Bournonville's ''Sylphide.'' At 4, 6:15 and 8:30 p.m. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600 or filmlinc.com; $10; $7 for students.

(La Rocco)    MOMIX (Tonight through Sunday) This popular troupe of shape shifters concludes the opening week of its three-week run at the Joyce Theater with ''Passion.'' Next week, an encore of ''Lunar Sea.'' Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $42. (La Rocco)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) No new Diamond Project ballets this week, just repertory programs featuring the latest premieres: Eliot Feld's tonight, Christopher Wheeldon's tomorrow afternoon, Mauro Bigonzetti's tomorrow evening, and Peter Martins's Sunday afternoon. There also is an all-Balanchine, all-Brahms double bill on Tuesday, with ''Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet'' repeated on Wednesday with the Balanchine/Stravinsky pairing of ''Monumentum pro Gesualdo'' and ''Movements for Piano and Orchestra'' and the Bigonzetti. The season runs until June 25. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday nights at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or nycballet.org; $30 to $86; student rush tickets at $15. (John Rockwell)    * NRITYAGRAM DANCE ENSEMBLE (Tonight and tomorrow) A hit last spring at the Joyce Theater, these leading practitioners of Indian Odissi dance return to the Skirball Center, part of a three-month United States tour that winds up May 26-31 at the Spoleto USA festival in Charleston, S.C. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 992-8484 or (212) 279-4200 or skirballcenter.nyu.edu; $38; $15 for students. (Rockwell)    WENDY OSSERMAN DANCE COMPANY (Sunday) Ms. Osserman describes herself as a choreographer who has been confusing the personal with the political and historical for three decades. She'll do it again in her recent ''Imagine/non lethal force.'' At 3 p.m., Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109 or theatermania.com; pay what you want on Sundays. (Dunning)    * RACHID OURAMDANE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Ouramdane, a French choreographer and dancer of Algerian descent, offers a fascinating, troubling hourlong solo about young men and suicide called ''Les Morts Pudiques'' (''Discreet Deaths'').

(Dunning)    STREB SLAM VI (Tonight through Sunday) Batten down the hatches. Elizabeth Streb's fearless high-fliers are at it again in ''Wild Blue Yonder,'' a new spring program paying tribute to early heroes of aviation, presented informally, with popcorn.

(Dunning)    VCU DANCE: TRAFFIC @ ST. MARKS (Tomorrow) In the latest installment of the DraftWork/Academy Dances series, VCU Dance makes its New York debut with a program featuring the work of current Virginia Commonwealth University students and alumni. At 3 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, Lower East Side, (212) 674-8194; free. (La Rocco)    VIA DANCE COLLABORATIVE (Tonight and tomorrow) This young company of 10 dancers and choreographers, including Lindsay Fisher, Dawn Poirier, Katie Edwards and Adrienne Westwood, has been described by the dance curator Monica Bill Barnes as ''a group of fierce, fearless dancers who arrived in new York and hit the ground running.'' Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444 or viadance.org; $20 at the door. (Dunning)    VISION FESTIVAL: YVES MUSARD (Sunday) Mr. Musard, a dancer and choreographer, will collaborate with Ned Rothenberg, an alto saxophonist. At 1:30 p.m., Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681 or visionfestival.org; $10; $7 for students and children over 14; free for children under 14.(Dunning)    * CHRISTOPHER WILLIAMS (Thursday) Mr. Williams, a dancer and choreographer who has worked with the puppeteer Basil Twist, made the remarkable ''Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins'' last season at P.S. 122. This new program offers more medievally inspired choreography: his ''Portuguese Suite'' and three solos from ''The Golden Legend,'' a male adjunct to the female ''Ursula,'' with John Kelly as one of the performers. (Through May 21.) At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or danspaceproject.org; $15. (Rockwell)    * WORKS & PROCESS AT THE GUGGENHEIM (Sunday and Monday) Get a sneak peek at James Kudelka's ''Cinderella'' before it has its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera House. American Ballet Theater performs excerpts from the work, while the artistic director Kevin McKenzie chats with Mr. Kudelka. At 8 p.m., the Peter B. Lewis Theater, Guggenheim Museum, (212) 423-3587; $24; $18 for students, 65+ and members. (La Rocco)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    * BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000.(Glueck)    DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'Stories to Tell: Masterworks from the Kelly Collection of American Illustration,' through May 21. During the Golden Age of Illustration -- the 1880's to the 1930's -- images made by painters for magazines and books captivated the collective American psyche. Original works by some of the best of those artists, including J. C. Leyendecker, N. C. Wyeth and Charles Dana Gibson, are included in this extensive and well-selected exhibition. 580 Madison Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Ken Johnson)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck)    * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000.(Holland Cotter)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early 18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (See above.) (Glueck)    * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)    * The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking,' through May 22. This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)    NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)    * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman)    Galleries: 57th Street    * 'Great Pots: The Vessel as Art, 1900 to 2000' This extraordinarily rich and varied lobby show presents 164 works by 143 artists from the Newark Museum's famed ceramics collection. It focuses on utilitarian vessels -- vases, bowls, pots, mugs and platters -- but covers an enormous amount of aesthetic territory, taking in Pueblo Indian, Arts and Crafts, classical Japanese, European Modernist, Pop, funk and much more. The show includes great craftsmen like George Orr, Beatrice Wood, Peter Voulkos and Ron Nagel. The UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, through May 19. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    * Josephsohn A powerful exhibition of five crusty, semi-abstract, oversized heads cast in bronze by a Zurich-based sculptor who was born in East Prussia in 1920. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through May 27. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    Judy Glantzman Her congested expressionistic paintings composed of scores of little human heads are like visions of hell by the Belgian Symbolist James Ensor. Also on view are scary and funny little doll-like figures made of a material called Super Sculpy. Betty Cuningham, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 242-2772, through May 26. (Johnson)    * Aaron Parazette: 'All On Up' This Houston-based painter creates punchy, colorful, sign-like compositions using big letters as his basic building blocks. The letters spell words like insane, juice and thruster, but they are variously inverted, reversed and mixed up to enhance the exceptionally gratifying graphic impact. Marlborough Chelsea, 211 West 19th Street, (212) 463-8634, through May 20. (Johnson)    * Rosalind Solomon, 'American Pictures from Chapalingas' This excellent exhibition of works from 1974 to 2000 surveys the career of a photographer with a keen eye for human individuality and a pitch-perfect sense of composition. Her art bears a family resemblance to that of Diane Arbus, but it is gentler and kinder. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through June 3. (Johnson)    Peter Vogel: 'Interactive Sonic & Light Sculptures' This German sculptor who was trained as a physicist is well known in Europe for the electronic light and sound works he has been creating since the late 1960's. His neat constructions of wire, transistors, lights and speakers look great, but they are especially interesting for the complex musical sounds they emit in response to the viewer's moving shadow. Bitforms, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 366-6939, through May 20. (Johnson)    Last Chance    Ken Butler: 'Instrumental Desire: Strings Attached' Trained as a classical musician and as a painter, Mr. Butler is a performance artist who produces electronically amplified music on unlikely stringed instruments that he constructs himself out of found objects and parts of real instruments. This jam-packed exhibition presents 79 instruments made from things like a rifle, an old sled, a leaf rake and a metal detector. Sideshow, 319 Bedford Avenue, at South Second Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-8180; closes Monday.(Johnson)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'GOYA's LAST WORKS,' This compact show is sublime. The most humane portraits are mixed with sketches, like diary entries, in which society is an irredeemable mob of lunatics and murderers. In exile in Bordeaux, Goya spent his last days in physical misery, lamenting man's essential evil while experimenting with the new medium of lithography and inventing the most exquisite, luminous paintings on tiny chips of ivory. Like the late works of Titian or Rembrandt, Goya's late works achieve a whole new level of freedom and depth, haunted by death but exalted. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; closes Sunday. ( Kimmelman)    * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,'  David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. (212) 423-3500; closes Sunday.( Cotter)    * Lisa Ruyter: 'I Am a Camera'  This painter, known for colorful, photo-based, psychedelic cartoons, takes an exciting turn to black, white and many shades of gray in a series of large, psychologically resonant, finely outlined self-portraits. The nearly 16-foot-wide portrait of the artist, doubled in a mirror against an arboreal background, is a knockout. Team, 527 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-9219; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    Robert Sholties: 'Evolution' A Pennsylvania postal worker with no formal art training, Mr. Sholties paints intensely detailed fantasy landscapes populated by wild and domestic animals and people who are often in South American costumes. Magical, allegorical and apocalyptic events occur, and themes of religion and ecological disaster are addressed in these visionary pictures. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-4819; closes tomorrow.

Vladimir Korolevitch, two years to photograph.Although it is undoubtedly interesting and informative, through the attempt to show too much in the footage and the consequent brevity of its scenes it fails to elicit anything like the excitement afforded by that memorable short subject, \\"Killing the Killer,\\" which, it will be remembered, depicted the killing of a cobra by a mongoose.This pictorial study stresses the struggle for life by animals, birds and reptiles, pointing out that, although all things require food, there is the distinction—some will eat and others will be eaten.Attention is called to the daylight animals and those of the night and in other episodes there are glimpses revealing nature's camouflage of beasts, birds and insects, and also their means of offense and defense. Lizards and crabs are shown digging in to postpone what is alluded to as the creature's \\"inevitable end.\\" Then there are those that \\"bristle for the fray,\\" such as porcupines and hedgehogs.

Unfortunately, however, \\"Loves of an Actress,\\" despite the enchantment of the plural, can be called only another motion picture.The background or the play is France in the middle of the last century. Miss Negri takes the part of an actress who has risen to being the toast of Paris—risen chiefly through her affairs with three important gentlemen—a banker, a newspaper owner and a count.It inevitably happens that at the height of her career she falls in love with a young man who is soon to become an Ambassador to Russia. Two of her former gentlemen friends grin and bear it","excerpt":"the third states sullenly that he loves her still. To prove it, he threatens to publish her letters in the columns which previously had been devoted to praising her acting.The actress, Rachel, first of all dares him to go ahead, but on sober second thought she realizes that not only will that be the end of her career but it will ruin her fiancé's as well. She breaks the engagement. Not long afterward she dies of a broken heart—first, however, playing a death scene in such a manner as to wring the greatest praise from her public.The chief trouble with \\"Loves of an Actress\\" is that it is too long. The story is not new, and as there is no suspense it all comes down to a question of waiting for the expected to happen. And then it develops so slowly as to be a little tiresome.There are scenes scattered here and there, however, which show Miss Negri's acting ability to good advantage. She gives a good portrait of an actress—if not necessarily of midnineteenth century France—and her relationships with her several admirers are well done. Nils Asther, as Raoul—the man she loves—cannot quite curb a tendency to overact his part; otherwise the supporting cast is acceptable.\\"Loves of an Actress\\" demonstrates ad absurdam the potentialities of synchnorization. The varied noises taking part in the action of the picture range from the squealing effect when a baby is shown crying through sundry barnyard effects early one morning to vocal selections.
