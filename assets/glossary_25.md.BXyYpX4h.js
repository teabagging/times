During a public reception at 4 P.M. tomorrow, she will speak again about the acquisition of the exhibit material, and another talk will be given by Dr. Leon Bass, an educator who was a member of the United States forces that liberated Buchenwald.    The tower of the title refers to the observation platform from which World War II prisoners were observed during their internment in Nazi camps. Mr. Nassy, an American artist of Surinamese and Jewish descent, was arrested by the Nazis while working in Belgium in 1942. He was sent to a civilian prisoner-of-war camp, where he documented his experiences in a series of 100 drawings and paintings produced with materials supplied by the International Y.M.C.A.    After his death in 1976, following a career in landscape and portrait painting, his prisoner-of-war series was acquired by the Wunderman Museum in Irvine, Calif., which organized this exhibition as a unique commemoration of the Holocaust and Black History Month. Exhibition hours are from 1 to 5 P.M. daily through March 22. Admission to the gallery and the talks is free. NOSTALGIA TRIP     The Hartford Stage Company and the Old Globe Theater of San Diego are jointly presenting A. R.

Jack O'Brien, artistic director of the Old Globe has staged the production, with choreography by Graciela Daniele.    Mr. Gurney has based the work on his 1987 novel of the same name, about a middle-aged businessman who gathers his schoolmates together for a nostalgic trip back to the ballrooms of their youth in the 1940's and 50's. Curtain times are 7:30 P.M.

LONG ISLAND SOUND     The Long Island Sound Study, undertaken by the Long Island Sound Taskforce in Stamford in cooperation with agencies in Westchester, New York City and Long Island, has scheduled several open meetings throughout the area. The purpose of the assemblies is to report on hypoxia management -- efforts to control the bacteria from sewage treatment plants and runoff.  Hypoxia is a growing threat to marine life, and the Long Island Sound Study's attempts to correct it will be explained. Meetings will be held on Thursday at the Groton Municipal Building Auditorium, 295 Meridian Street, and on Feb. 12 at the Maritime Center, 10 North Water Street in Norwalk. Two sessions will be held on each date, from 1:30 to 4:30 P.M. and from 7 to 9:30 P.M. The public is encouraged to attend the free sessions. For more information, call 789-7865. SCULPTURE IN STEEL     Lee Tribe, a British sculptor who works in welded steel, went right to the source for his initial training -- as an apprentice boilermaker on the docks of London. He converted that skill to art by studying at the Birmingham and St. Martin's Schools of Art in England and at the New York Studio School in Manhattan.   An exhibition of his work opens today with a reception from 1 to 4 P.M. in the Charles Plohn Gallery of Sacred Heart University, 5151 Park Avenue, Fairfield.    Mr. Tribe received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1987 and is represented by the Victoria Munroe Gallery in New York. He has exhibited in London, Athens, Boston and Los Angeles, and he has taught at Columbia University and Bennington College.    His three-dimensional abstract creations will remain on view through March 7. Gallery hours are from noon to 4 P.M. on Sunday, noon to 7:30 P.M. Monday through Thursday. Admission is free. BIOLOGY TOURS     Some 3,000 species of plants representing two-thirds of all plant families in the world may be seen to maximum advantage during guided weekend tours at the University of Connecticut's Museum of Natural History greenhouses on the Storrs campus.    Sponsored by the department of ecology and evolutionary biology, the tours are led by university biologists who guide visitors through climates that vary from tropical to desert to Alpine. Among the rarer plants are more than 500 species of orchids, hundreds of succulents and cacti as well as banana, tea, coffee, cocoa, vanilla and other food plants including the teosinte, which produces two-inch ears of corn. Other exotica include the plelospilos, which looks like a rock and grows as fast, carnivorous plants and tropical ferns 20-feet tall.    Tours will begin at 1 and 3 P.M. today, Saturday and next Sunday, and at the same hours on March 2, 3, 23 and 24. The fee is $5. To make reservations, which are required, call 486-4460. The greenhouses, at 75 North Eagleville Road, are open to the public without charge from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. Monday through Friday. CHINESE ART     Bada Shanren, who is considered to be one of China's most influential artists, was born into the imperial Ming family in 1626. When he was 18 years old, his idyllic world was destroyed by Manchu invaders. To avert capture, he spent the next 30 years as a poet, artist, teacher and priest in a Buddhist temple.    In his 50's, he renounced Buddhism and took to wandering the streets in rags, raving like a madman, which some believe he became. Others suspect that he feigned madness in order to be free of all influences -- Buddhist, Manchu or Ming. Until his death in 1705, he produced an enormous body of work in a unique style that was to become inspirational for Chinese artists of the 19th and 20th centuries.    More than 100 examples of his scrolls, fans and album leaves exemplifying his genius as painter and calligrapher may be seen at the Yale Art Gallery at Chapel and York Streets in New Haven through March 24. Hours are from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday, 2 to 5 P.M. Sunday and Thursday evenings until 8.

They crept along at five miles an hour or less on just about every major highway and bridge leading into Manhattan. Tens of thousands of people were late to work, school, business appointments, visits to doctors.    Why? Because the city and state say that livery drivers not already covered by workers' compensation -- about half -- must pay for coverage. That will cost up to $2,700 a car, an expense that livery owners will no doubt pass on to their drivers.

It's a nice concept -- but one that's often hard to pull off when you are an American tourist traveling through Europe and struggling to find ways to offset the weakness of the dollar. Here is some help: money-saving tips on everything from hotel rooms to cultural events from New York Times correspondents and contributors in 15 major European cities.       Affordable accommodation within Amsterdam's tiny and coveted historic center is almost impossible to come by, and even the shortest of taxi rides seems to cost at least 10 euros ($12.40, at $1.24 to the euro). But if you take your cues from the locals who get around on bikes and make do with living on the outskirts, this city can be done on a tight budget.    Where to Eat Cheaply       You get what you pay for when it comes to food in the Netherlands, where most ingredients are imported or grown at fairly high cost in greenhouses. So unless you have a strong affinity for bitterballs -- fried meatballs that are the buffalo wings of the Netherlands -- you can't avoid spending a fairly substantial amount for decent meals. Fortunately, the intimate and cozy Balthazar's Keuken (Elandsgracht 108","excerpt":"31-20-420-2114), while considered one of Amsterdam's top restaurants, is also one of the most affordable, serving up a three-course prix-fixe meal at 24.50 euros. A typical menu might start with an assortment of five hot and cold appetizers like wild spinach croquettes or cinnamon crostini with spicy beet root, followed with a choice of a meat or a fish main dish like a bouillabaisse with saffron, fennel and red onions and end with a dessert of espresso mascarpone with prunes poached in sherry. A bottle of house wine is 15 euros.    Lodging for Under 100 Euros       The Lloyd (Oostelijke Handelskade 34; 31-20-561-3636; www.lloydhotel.com), a 1921 building on the water in the Eastern Docklands about 10 minutes east of Central Station, recently transformed into a modern and airy hotel, offers rooms at 80 to 300 euros. While the small 80-euro rooms mean sharing a bathroom and shower down the hall, they are one of the best deals in town. Single rooms for 85 euros a night can be found at the newly opened NL Hotel (Nassaukade 368; 31-20-689-0030; www.nl-hotel.com), just a few minutes' walk from Leidseplein. Decorated by the well-known Dutch designer Edward van Vliet, rooms are small but stylish. Prices for a single go up to 100 euros on weekend nights, and breakfast is 10 euros a person.    Best Deal on a Cultural Event       This year marks the 400th anniversary of Rembrandt's birth, and to celebrate, the city has organized a whirlwind of exhibits and events. The cheapest way to experience it all is to buy the I Amsterdam Card (www.iamsterdamcard.com), which for 31 euros offers access to the city's most important museums, two boat tours and unrestricted use of the city's efficient public transportation system. It's good for 24 hours after its initial use.    Best Things to Do Free       Vondelpark, the city's largest park, hosts a series of free open-air concerts throughout the summer starting in June (www.openluchttheater.nl ). Also, every Friday at 8 p.m. hundreds of in-line skaters and roller skaters -- all experienced visitors are welcome -- converge on the park near the Filmmuseum for a night of rolling through the city (www.fridaynightskate.com).    Best Money-Saving Tip       Like-a-Local is a quirky travel company that offers an affordable variety of experiences with Amsterdamers as hosts. That might include living with a local in the emerging De Pijp neighborhood (79 euros a night for a room with its own bathroom) or a four-course dinner cooked by Liedewij and Jolein (27.50 euros a person including wine) in their home. Or there are private boat rides through the canals at night. At 60 euros for two hours, that's an especially good deal when shared among a few friends. (31-20-670-2483; www.like-a-local.com).

But Mr. Bush also urged Israel to exercise restraint in its military actions.   A10    Israeli officials indicated that their bombardments of an Arab village on Wednesday could be the start of an offensive against ''terrorists and their infrastructure.'' A leader of the Palestinian Fatah movement warned that it would take its violent activities beyond the West Bank and Gaza if Israeli strikes continued.   A7    Bush to Meet Brazil's Leader  President Bush and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso will meet today in Washington, in advance of a summit meeting of hemispheric heads of state next month.   A10    Action on Argentine Economy  The new economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, won congressional passage of his emergency financial package, giving the shaky government some relief and giving investors hope that a default could be averted.   A5    Clashes Cross Kosovo Border  Fighting between Macedonian forces and ethnic Albanian rebels spilled into Kosovo, killing 3 people and wounding 16. A mortar attack narrowly missed foreign peacekeepers patrolling in Kosovo. A British journalist was among those killed.

That ended the last major Senate challenge to the effort to ban unrestricted donations to political parties. A final Senate vote is expected on Monday.   A1    McCain-Feingold appears to enjoy even greater bipartisan support in the House than in the Senate, but it faces an adamant and powerful foe in the Republican whip, Tom DeLay.   A1    House Backs Two Tax Cuts  The House approved two elements of President Bush's tax-cut plan -- lowering taxes for married couples and doubling the tax credit for families with children -- and moved toward abolition of the estate tax.   A1    Looking Elsewhere for Energy  President Bush said he was prepared to exploit oil and gas resources elsewhere in the nation on land that was not federally protected, if his plans for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge were blocked.   A13    No Decision on Drug Strategy  A report commissioned by the Clinton White House takes no position on the relative effectiveness of drug enforcement versus drug treatment, saying data and research are inadequate to draw any conclusions.

A1    A Brooklyn couple active in the antiabortion movement, Dennis John Malvasi and Loretta Claire Marra, were charged with trying to sneak Mr. Kopp into the United States.   B4    EDUCATION    Vote on Privatizing Schools  Prospects that Edison Schools would win a contract to run five failing New York City public schools appeared dim, as turnout among parents was light in voting at four of the schools and strong at one school where opposition to the plan has been strong.

Its organizers were MARCEL DUCHAMP and a painter, teacher and dogged missionary of art named KATHERINE DREIER. With Duchamp and Man Ray she started the Société Anonyme.    Born in 1877 in Brooklyn to immigrants from Germany with progressive beliefs, Dreier was a woman apparently without charm or a sense of humor but with a zealot's heart. She may be the most underrated hero among the visionary American women (Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Lillie Bliss, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Louisine Havemeyer, the list goes on) who first established modern art and its institutions here, and she is certainly the one who did the most with the fewest inherited resources.    Henry McBride, the great art critic, recalled the Société Anonyme's first meeting at its gallery on East 47th Street. It was, he wrote in 1920, a gathering of ''somewhat hungry looking'' long-haired young men and short-haired young women. The society, through its exhibitions, sheer guile and wit, gradually amassed a stupendous collection, much of which ended up at Yale University, which has now organized a fitting tribute to Dreier, ''THE SOCIÉTÉ ANONYME: MODERNISM FOR AMERICA.'' The show, at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles (through Aug. 20","excerpt":"310-443-7000), ends a long tour in New Haven, in 2010.    Dreier was open to everything so long as it was new. By the late 1920's Picasso and Matisse were old hat (the former, she announced, had ''settled down to retirement as far as the art world was concerned''). So the Brooklyn show was, like the present exhibition, full of names of artists now forgotten but whose works, even if it's hard to imagine today, looked shocking to an American audience in the years just before the Museum of Modern Art existed. Dreier and her Brooklyn show paved the way for the Modern, and in turn for a revolution in America. THE WEEK AHEAD: May 14 - May 20; ART/ARCHITECTURE"},{"year":"2008","title":"Hungry? Good.

Thai cooking depends on maintaining a subtle interplay between hot, sour, sweet and salty flavors, and this balancing act plays out in the salads, or yums. At Arharn Thai (pronounced ARE-harn), the salads offer a wonderful and largely accurate sign of things to come.    BALKH SHISH KABAB HOUSE  (718) 721-5020; 23-10 31st Street (23rd Avenue); $; $25 and Under: 9/9/98.  Balkh, named after a town in Afghanistan, is a simple restaurant with a breezy garden.

SABRY'S  (718) 721-9010; 24-25 Steinway Street (25th Avenue); $; $25 and Under: 6/8/05.  Following Muslim practice, this Egyptian seafood restaurant serves neither wine nor beer. The reason to go is the excellent fish. Whole fish are available baked and grilled, seasoned with lemon, oil and cumin, cooked quickly and expertly, and served without adornment, save a sprinkling of fresh herbs.

ANGON ON THE SIXTH  (212) 260-8229","excerpt":"320 East Sixth Street; $; $25 and Under: 9/1/04.       The familiar and conversational service at Angon means you will almost certainly discuss your order with the waiters, who can guide you to hidden gems like the fish curry or liver jhal fry: creamy chicken livers, a whisper past medium rare, in a sweet sauce dense with onions. Angon offers 10 vegetarian main courses, the standout being dhal fry, a luxuriously creamy dish of yellow lentils finished with mustard oil.

For good reason: this is a place where countdowns really count, the home of the John F. Kennedy Space Center. And though NASA's recent record has been a checkered one, there's excitement along the coast once again, with a new shuttle launch scheduled for this summer. But beyond the space program's otherworldly appeal, the region has much to offer, from unspoiled beaches to one of the country's best surf shops. Feeling hungry? You can dine on fine French cuisine or fresh Florida seafood -- or just head to a local souvenir shop for some freeze-dried ice cream, an astronaut favorite.   CHARLES PASSY    Friday  6 p.m.  1 -- Ocean Outreach    The Space Coast's lovably scruffy side reveals itself at the Cocoa Beach Pier (401 Meade Avenue, Cocoa Beach","excerpt":"321-783-7549), a 44-year-old hangout that stretches some 800 feet into the Atlantic Ocean. You come here to drink, dine or fish -- the pier is dotted with stores, bars and restaurants, both indoors and outdoors -- or just take in the expansive view. The pier scene really hops during the Friday-night ''Boardwalk Bash,'' when bands perform. Enjoy a cold one and some bar fare (wings, burgers, fish and chips) at the Marlins Good Times Bar and Grill while listening to the music.    8 p.m.  2 -- Hang 10, 24/7    Who doesn't feel the need to go surfboard shopping on a Friday night? O.K., so maybe you're not ready to plunk down up to $900 to ride the waves in style, but the selections at the justly famous Ron Jon Surf Shop (4151 North Atlantic Avenue, Cocoa Beach; 321-799-8888) go beyond boards and surfing gear. The two-story, 52,000-square-foot store, which is open 24 hours a day -- and claims to be visited by more than 2 million people annually -- also sells beachwear, shot glasses, Polynesian kitsch and other ''why did I buy that?'' items. A spirit of endless hooky pervades, as evidenced by the T-shirt for sale that says, ''I was on summer vacation for 20 years.''    Saturday    8 a.m.  3 -- Breakfast Cubano    While Cuban food is most associated with the Miami area, the Space Coast can lay claim to one of the state's best spots -- Roberto's Little Havana Restaurant (26 North Orlando Avenue, Cocoa Beach; 321-784-1868). It's a downtown Cocoa Beach favorite serving all the Cuban classics, from palomilla steak to fried yuca to flan. But at breakfast time, it's the place to be for an egg-bacon-cheese sandwich ($4.95), served on soft Cuban bread. Good Cuban coffee, too.    9:30 a.m.  4 -- Citrus Stop    You're in Florida, so you'll have to stop for some liquid sunshine -- a k a orange juice. Policicchio Groves (5780 North Courtenay Parkway, Merritt Island; 321-452-4866; closed some weekends in summer, call ahead for hours) fills the bill on the Space Coast. This 85-year-old enterprise, run by Carolina Policicchio (below), has an assortment of oranges and grapefruits; the varieties change each month during the winter and the spring-to-early-summer growing seasons. Everything is freshly picked; the groves are across the road.    10:30 a.m.  5 -- A Space Odyssey    The John F. Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex (Route 405, Titusville; 321-449-4444; admission $31, $21 for children ages 3 to 11) may vaguely resemble one of Florida's many theme parks at first, but very soon it becomes much more inspiring. Start with a walk through the Rocket Garden, an open-air space that features awe-inspiring Redstone, Atlas and Titan rockets that date from the days of the Mercury and Gemini missions; you can also squeeze into replicas of the capsules the astronauts used. But that's the appetizer to the space center's main course -- a roughly three-hour bus tour that gives you a sense of how big the center truly is (some 140,000 acres, including the surrounding wildlife refuge). The tour stops at such key sites as the International Space Station Center and the 60-foot LC 39 Observation Gantry. Along the way, you'll pass the Vehicle Assembly Building -- a structure so cavernous, clouds are said to have formed inside it. The tour's most jaw-dropping stop is the Apollo/Saturn V Center, a huge hangar that contains an actual Saturn V rocket. Take time to look at the individual exhibits about the Apollo program, all presented with extraordinary detail.    2:45 p.m.  6 -- Close Encounter    Now that you've gotten yourself acquainted (or reacquainted) with the space program, it's time to meet a real astronaut. The center's Astronaut Encounter affords an opportunity to do just that. Veterans of the space program, mostly from the shuttle era, give daily 30-minute presentations about their experiences and field questions from the audience. (There are at least three presentations daily, with one generally at mid-afternoon.) Want a little more face time? For an extra $22.99 ($15.99 for children), you can sign up for Lunch With an Astronaut, which takes place daily at 12:15 p.m. Among those who have participated in both the encounter and lunch programs are the Apollo 15 astronaut Al Worden and the six-time shuttle veteran Story Musgrave.    3:30 p.m.  7 -- Astronaut Memorial    Twenty-four astronauts have died in their attempts to slip ''the surly bonds of earth,'' as the World War II pilot John Gillespie Magee Jr. put it in a poem quoted by President Reagan after the 1986 Challenger disaster. Those men and women are remembered at the center's simple, stark Space Mirror Memorial -- a black granite surface in which the 24 names are inscribed. When the light is at the right angle, the names seem to float in space.    7 p.m.  8 -- Au Côte d'Espace    The Space Coast may not be a citadel of fine dining, but Café Margaux (220 Brevard Avenue, Cocoa; 321-639-8343) is an exception to the rule. This quaint restaurant, set in the tree-lined Cocoa Village district, is proudly French, with a few nods elsewhere. Start off with the hearty country-style duck pâté ($9.95) or a zesty curried Caesar salad ($4.95). Entrees include a pleasing mélange of seafood prepared three ways ($22.95) and a stick-to-your-ribs veal chop over risotto ($28.95). The wine list places equal emphasis on New and Old World vintages.    Sunday    10 a.m.  9 -- Natural Habitat    It takes a lot of surrounding land to keep the Kennedy Space Center's launch sites properly isolated. Much of that acreage is encompassed within the buffer zone that is the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (321-861-0667; admission is free) -- a huge, mostly untouched tract that is home to migratory birds in the winter and has more than a dozen active bald eagle nests. Begin your journey by picking up a map at one of the kiosks near the entrances to the refuge (the small visitor's center is closed Sundays from April to October), then head to the gloriously remote beaches, which are part of the separately managed Canaveral National Seashore (321-267-1110; admission $3). Conclude with a visit to the refuge's Black Point Wildlife Drive -- a seven-mile loop that allows you to get close to wildlife, including alligators and egrets, without leaving your car.    1 p.m.  10 -- In the Realm of the Shrimp    The family-owned Dixie Crossroads Seafood Restaurant (1475 Garden Street, Titusville; 321-268-5000) is mostly about shrimp. It has its own fleet of about 10 full-time commercial shrimpers, which provide the restaurant with its lobsterlike rock shrimp and more firmly textured Royal Red shrimp, among other Florida varieties. (Once you try these, you'll find it hard to go back to garden-variety frozen shrimp.) The shrimp can be had broiled, fried or steamed; prices range from $10.49 to $31.99, depending on variety and number of shrimp. But before you dig in, you'll get to enjoy the corn fritters starters included with every meal. The bustling setting is also a hoot -- part Old Florida (wildlife murals and a fish pond), part pure kitsch. You can pose outside with Mr. and Mrs. Rock -- cartoonish statues of a rock shrimp ''family.''    Surfing the Stars Or the Atlantic       The Space Coast is about an hour's drive east of Orlando. Melbourne International Airport is the closest major airport; Delta Air Lines offers several flights a day. A car is a must to explore the area.     One of the newest hotels in the area also happens to be one of the best -- the surf-themed, family-friendly Ron Jon Cape Caribe Resort (1000 Shorewood Drive, Cape Canaveral; 888-933-3030; www.ronjonresort.com), which is on the ocean and convenient to busy Port Canaveral, a departure point for several cruise lines. Among its many amenities are a ''lazy river'' and a pool, both heated, and a miniature golf course.

It's a nice concept -- but one that's often hard to pull off when you are an American tourist traveling through Europe and struggling to find ways to offset the weakness of the dollar. Here is some help: money-saving tips on everything from hotel rooms to cultural events from New York Times correspondents and contributors in 15 major European cities.       Now that the French government has withdrawn a disputed youth labor law, tourists can visit Paris without worrying too much about the disruption of massive protests and strikes. And no matter how expensive Paris can seem -- especially with the weak dollar -- there are endlessly creative ways to save money.    Where to Eat Cheaply       Around every corner is another bistro, where all day, every day, one can find good food, good wine and good value (for Paris, that is). A jewel, hidden in an unremarkable part of the 15th Arrondissement, is Le Troquet (21, rue François Bonvin","excerpt":"33-1-45-66-89-00). Lively, Basque-inspired, sometimes smoke-filled, it has a 38-euro ($47, at $1.24 to the euro) six-course -- yes, six-course -- tasting menu that changes every week. One sample menu includes cream of cauliflower soup, vegetable barigoule with bacon and country ham, shellfish ravioli, confit of lamb shoulder, madeleines with a pot of vanilla cream, and macaroons with praline-dusted mousse and roasted banana. A three-course menu is 30 euros ($37), without wine. Closed Sunday and Monday.    Lodging for Under 100 Euros       Damp in winter, stuffy in summer, dark all year round. That pretty much describes the world of cut-rate hotel rooms in Paris. An exception is the 30-room New Orient Hotel at 16, rue de Constantinople in the heart of the Eighth Arrondissement (33-1-45-22-21-64; www.hotel-paris-orient.com). A 10-minute walk from the Parc Monceau, the antiques-filled hotel feels, well, very French. The rooms are small but comfortable and clean, and 16 have small balconies. Rates: 82 euros for a single room (with shower), 105 euros for a double (with full bath).    Best Deal on a Cultural Event       Museums in Paris are expensive. The two-, four- or six-day museum passes (38, 55 and 72 euros, respectively) make it less pricey -- but only if a lot of museums can be crammed in. However, a number of Paris museums are free, including the newly restored Musée du Petit Palais. Just off the Champs-Elysées, the museum, with its sweeping staircases and collection of ancient sculptures, medieval tapestries and paintings, reopened last year after a five-year renovation. The garden of the Musée Rodin, which has many of his sculptures, costs only one euro (a visit to the museum's permanent collection is six euros).      Visitors who have had enough of museums can go to the free, half-hour haute couture and prêt-à-porter fashion show on the seventh floor of the Galeries Lafayette department store every Friday at 3 p.m. Both men's and women's fashions are featured. Reservations are a must (33-1-42-82-30-25; www.galerieslafayette.com). Le Printemps department store across the street offers a similar free fashion show on Tuesdays at 10 a.m.    Best Things to Do Free       Every Friday night at 10, traffic is stopped for a three-hour in-line skating run through the capital. The 12-mile trip starts and ends at the Place Raoul Dautry, in the 14th Arrondissement. A gentler run that starts and ends at the Place de la Bastille takes place on Sunday afternoons. For the itineraries and more information, see www.rollers-coquillages.org for Friday and www.pari-roller.com for Sunday.    Best Money-Saving Tip       The cheapest way to see Paris is with a one-hour one-way ride on the No. 69 public bus (1.40 euros). The bus starts and ends at two tourist destinations -- the Eiffel Tower in the west (at the Avenue Joseph Bouvard) and Père Lachaise Cemetery in the east. Along the eastward route, the bus passes Les Invalides, the Seine, the Louvre, the Hôtel de Ville, the Marais, the Place de la Bastille. And you mingle with French people, not tourists.

But Lyon is older than Paris, has more Roman ruins and, as local residents will tell you, better food.      Over the last 15 years, Lyon has restored and replanted some 100 public spaces. The warehouses along the River Saône have been transformed into galleries for the Biennial of Contemporary Art. A flying-saucer-shaped amphitheater, designed by Renzo Piano, just opened at his Lyon Convention Center. And culturally, the city is bursting with festivals and concerts.      The Nuits de Fourvière, one of Europe's oldest summer festivals, is presenting music, drama and film in two of the city's 2,000-year-old Roman theaters through Aug. 4. In September, the focus turns to dance, as performers from around the world, including the Egyptian Modern Dance Company, celebrate Lyon's Biennale de la Danse. In other words, while the French capital thinks it achieved perfection sometime in the 19th century, Lyon is still trying to get there.    WHERE TO STAY -- Travelers who want to live like Lyon's 16th-century silk merchants should head to the cobblestone streets of the old city, Vieux Lyon, a Unesco World Heritage site, where almost 300 Renaissance mansions still stand. Four of these grand residences now make up the Cour des Loges (2-8, rue du Boeuf","excerpt":"33-4-72-77-44-44; www.courdesloges.com). This lavish hotel, dating from the 14th to the 17th centuries, features an elegant courtyard and 62 rooms, some with fireplaces and timbered ceilings. Rooms start at 230 euros ($297 at $1.29 to the euro), though special rates can be found through the hotel's Web site.      Another ancient gem, the Villa Florentine, situated halfway up the Fourvière hill, was once a nunnery (25, montée St.-Barthélémy; 33-4-72-56-56-56; www.villaflorentine.com). But asceticism has given way to luxury, with amazing views of the city, particularly from the hotel's Michelin-starred restaurant, Les Terrasses de Lyon. Official rates for the 28 rooms start at 195 euros.      If not a stay in a former convent, how about reliving your school days? The 39-room Collège hotel (5, Place St.-Paul, 33-4-72-10-05-05, www.college-hotel.com) has classroomlike tables in the breakfast ''study hall'' and rates listed by academic levels: 105 euros for the all-white ''undergraduate'' room to 140 for a larger ''postgraduate'' unit with an A-plus view of the city.     Many hotels are clustered on Presqu'île, the peninsula formed by the Saône and Rhône Rivers. Among the best are the 53-room Grand Hôtel des Terreaux (16, rue Lanterne; 33-4-78-27-04-10; www.hotel-lyon.fr), which has an indoor pool and spacious doubles from 115 euros, and the modern 161-room Sofitel Bellecour (20, quai Gailleton; 33-4-72-41-20-20; www.sofitel.com), which has a one-star restaurant, Les Trois Dômes, overlooking the Rhône, and doubles from 275 euros (though specials can be less).    WHERE TO EAT -- The best reason to visit Lyon is the food. If you can't trek a few miles north of downtown to the Michelin three-star Paul Bocuse (40, quai de la Plage, Pont de Collonges, 33-4-72-42-90-90; www.bocuse.fr), where four-course dinners start at 115 euros, you can sample Mr. Bocuse's simpler fare at one of five Brasseries Bocuse in Lyon. Try L'Est at the Brotteaux railroad station (33-4-37-24-25-26) for its spit-roasted Bresse chicken (19 euros) and choo-choo train décor.      Lyon has a fair share of creative younger chefs, too. Among them is Alain Alexanian, who spices up quenelles (pike dumplings) with paprika and embeurrée de pommes de terre (buttery potatoes) with chicory, at L'Alexandrin (83, rue Moncey; 33-4-72-61-15-69; www.lalexandrin.com). A six-course Mode de Lyon menu is 60 euros.      Nicolas Le Bec, 34, the youngest of this new breed, pairs fresh ingredients in novel ways at his eponymous restaurant (14, rue Grolée; 33-4-78-42-15-00; nicolaslebec.com). The 48-euro prix fixe lunch might include stuffed zucchini flower and turbot with artichokes in eucalyptus broth.     For something cheaper but no less delicious, the charming Les Adrets (30, rue du Boeuf, 33-4-78-38-24-30) offers a three-course lunch including a lentil-and-foie-gras terrine for 14 euros, wine included.      For heartier fare, go to a bouchon -- a Lyon institution that serves traditional fare like andouillete and boudin noir in a boisterous, informal setting. Be warned: lots of places call themselves bouchons but are really tourist traps. Some of the best can be found on the rue du Garet, including Garet (No. 7; 33-4-78-28-16-94), Le Petit Bouchon Chez Georges, (No. 8; 33-4-78-28-30-46) and Petit Flore (No. 19; 33-4-78-27-27-51).      Another classic is La Meunière (11, rue Neuve, 33-4-78-28-62-91), where the potato salad is served from earthenware bowls, the sausages are cut to order and the four-course dinner is 24 euros.    WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY -- The semisecret passageways called traboules, which date back to Roman times, will take you through gorgeous courtyards in the old city, with Italianate towers and spiral stairways. If you drop by the Romanesque-Gothic Cathédral St.-Jean at noon, you can see the 14th-century astronomical clock do its coo-coo-like re-enactment of the Annunciation.      It's a steep walk up Fourvière hill to the dazzlingly white Notre Dame Basilica, which reigns over Lyon as Sacré Coeur does over Paris (but there's also a funicular). Nearby is the Museum of Gallo-Roman Civilization (17, rue Cléberg; 33-4-72-38-49-30; www.musees-gallo-romains.com) for a quick archaeology lesson; admission is 3.8 euros; it is closed on Mondays.      On Presqu'île, the Museum of Textiles (34, rue de la Charité; 33-4-78-38-42-00; www.musee-des-tissus.com) pays tribute to Lyon silk-making. Check out the green and rose tapestries that Marie Antoinette left behind in Versailles in 1789 (5 euros; closed Mondays).      While Lyon's Beaux-Arts Museum (20, place des Terreaux, 33-4-72-10-17-40; 6 euros) is justifiably proud of its ''Ascension of Christ'' by Perugino, don't miss the stairway murals by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, a Lyon-born painter whose work foreshadowed symbolism. Closed Tuesdays.     Two other favorite sons are Auguste and Louis Lumière, brothers who invented the cinématographe, a 19th-century precursor to the camcorder. Their groundbreaking movie ''Leaving the Factory'' is among many of their pioneering films shown at the Institut Lumière (25, rue du Premier Film; 33-4-78-78-18-95; www.institut-lumiere.org; 6 euros). Closed Monday.     A less laudable character was Klaus Barbie, a k a the Butcher of Lyon. He was the SS commander responsible for the torture and death of thousands of French citizens, including the Resistance hero Jean Moulin. The somber Center for the History of the Resistance and Deportation now occupies Barbie's Gestapo headquarters (14, avenue Berthelot, 33-4-78-72-23-11); 3.80 euros; closed Monday and Tuesday.    WHERE TO SHOP -- Lyon is the birthplace of Guignol, the marionette that has been entertaining audiences for centuries. You can find him and a wide selection of his descendants, including a jolly French waiter that costs 290 euros, at Chez Disagn' Cardelli (6, rue St-Jean, 33-4-78-37-01-67). There are puppet shows, too. For older marionettes, dolls and wind-up toys, try Antic Dolls-Toys in one the antiques quarters (40, rue Auguste-Compte, 33-4-78-42-91-51).      From Lyon's candy department: pink pralines (almonds encased in uncaramelized sugar) and coussins (bite-size rectangles of almond paste filled with chocolate ganache). Voisin, a chocolatemaker with boutiques around town, created the coussins in 1960 to look like silk pillows. Another sweet stop is Chocolaterie Ginet (9, rue de la Charité, 33-4-78-42-09-82), run by the master chocolatier Thierry Dubruc.    WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT -- The smoky bars around the Hôtel de Ville, including Ayers Rock (2-4, rue Désirée, 33-8-20-32-02-03) and Albion Public House (12, rue Ste.-Catherine, 33-4-78-28-33-00), are popular with the T-shirt and jeans crowd. If your music tastes include hip-hop bands from Slovenia, head for La Fée Verte (4, rue Pizay, 33-4-78-28-32-35).      For an easy-going gay scene, try Cap Opéra around the corner from the Opéra (2, place Louis Pradel, 33-4-72-07-61-55). Across the Saône, dance clubs like Alibi (13, quai Romain Rolland, 33-4-78-42-04-66) attract a dressier crowd in their 20's and 30's. And in the summer, old riverboats become clubs along the banks of the Rhône.    YES, FREE -- For entertainment, the Romans headed for the hill, Fourvière. Make your own fun there today by clambering over the impressive ruins at Archeological Park. There's a large amphitheater (perhaps the oldest in France), a smaller Odéon (where the elite listened to speeches and music), and a spectacular view over the red-tiled roofs that seems to go on forever .    YOUR FIRST TIME OR YOUR 10th -- Butchers, bakers, sausage makers and the occasional oyster bar line the aisles at La Halle de la Part-Dieu (102, cours Lafayette), the 1971 covered market where the city's best chefs are said to shop. At Maréchal, you can tell the goat cheeses from the cow-derived ones by the little animal pictured on the price tags. The super-luxury traiteur Rolle sells foie gras in amazing variations, including a tarte Tatin.    WHERE TO STAY WIRED -- All but the cheapest hotels have Internet access. But if you want to check your e-mail over a cup of exotic tea, head for Le Mundo Café in the travel bookstore Raconte-Moi la Terre (38, rue Thomassin; 33-4-78-92-60-20; www.raconte-moi.com ). Thirty minutes cost 2.50 euros.    GETTING THERE  -- A number of airlines fly from Kennedy International to Lyon through various European hubs. A recent Web seach found round-trip fares from about $920 The high-speed TGV train can also zip you from Paris to Lyon in about two hours (from 110 euros round trip).    GETTING AROUND -- Lyon's Métro system is so modern that you rarely see a conductor. A single ride costs 1.50 euros; a Lyon City Card, which gives you unlimited rides and entry to many museums, is 18 euros a day. But consider renting a red bicycle from one of the 173 Vélo'v racks all over town (www.velov.grandlyon.com). The first 30 minutes are free (after putting a 150-euro deposit on a credit card); the next hour is .50 euro.
