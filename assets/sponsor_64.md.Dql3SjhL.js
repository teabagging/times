The photoplay has been constructed with meticulous attention to the edicts of the movie school of conventionalities","excerpt":"true characterization, intrigue and subtlety are conspicuously absent. Still, the idea of introducing a chorus girl from a burlesque show and having her try valiantly to grasp the ways of a less demonstrative society, does bring to mind Shaw's cockney heroine.As it not intrequently happens in motion pictures, the hero of this affair is handsome, good and immensely wealthy; the heroine is pretty but poor. James Ashmore Creelman and Frank Vreeland, the authors, in bringing these two persons together emphasize the girl's ignorance of ordinary social amenities and give her the name of Orchid Murphy. The man in the case is known as Brian Alden, and like most young men in this type of screen subject, he leaps into a love affair with the gir. What is also not unusual, he finds, immediately after proposing marriage to Orchid, that he must leave on a six months tour of South America. You wonder why he does not take Orchid with him, but that would be a terrible mistake, for then the Aunt would never get the chance of disturbing the course of true love by admonishing Orchid to control her exuberance and reminding the girl that people who know what's what never make a \\"vulgar display of their emotions.\\" This would have been all very well with a restrained young person, but Orchid is in the habit of giving vent to her joie de vivre by turning cartwheels in the drawing room. The consequence is that Brian is deeply disappointed when he returns to find a blasé little Orchid. He scolds his Aunt for having robbed the girl of her vivacity and spark.Richard Rosson has to get the credit or take the blame for this effusion. Two other directors worked on the picture before him, and while it was in course of production Miss Swanson was indisposed. There are one or two scenes in which the photography is quite clever, but the narrative as a whole is not especially absorbing, which at times may be a virtue, as it gives you the opportunity of thinking of other things that must be done during that day or the next.Miss Swanson is attractive, but her boyish bob suits her better than the coiffure she has in this film. She manages, as Orchid, to elude most easily the eyes of her brother; she makes signals and draws a question mark on her hand, which causes one to reflect that many characters in films suddenly have to be dumb or blind to carry out the effect of a scene.Eugene O'Brien figures as Brian. His performance is moderately interesting. Walter Goss plays the part of Orchid's brother, with a stare, a scowl and an imaginary pistol in his pocket.This particular film is not one that is apt to improve Mr. Shaw's opinion of motion pictures in general, even if there is a hint of \\"Pygmalion.\\" THE SCREEN; Restraining Exuberance."},{"year":"1931","title":"The loss of the \\"true Christmas spirit of Christian joy and peace,\\" particularly in this city, was deplored by the Rev.

The challenge will be to keep the gains made there as American and Iraqi forces move on to other areas.  A1    Storm Ravages Baja California  Heavy rains destroyed homes, killed livestock and washed out roads through the middle of Baja California, but no people were killed, officials said, as the remnants of Tropical Storm John swept up the peninsula.  A2    Iran Will Talk, Not Halt Program  The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, met with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran and said the president was willing to enter into negotiations on his country's nuclear program but would not agree to suspend uranium enrichment beforehand, as demanded by the Security Council. A4    Italians Land in Lebanon  Hundreds of Italian marines, and their armored vehicles, landed in southern Lebanon, the first large foreign contingent of what is to become a reinforced United Nations buffer force on the border with Israel. The arrival of an expected 1,000 Italian troops will bring the total peacekeeping force to 3,250 of a projected 15,000.  A4    Iraqi Terror Leader Captured  American and Iraqi troops have captured Hamid Juma Faris Jouri al-Saeedi, the second-ranking leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, who supervised the bombers of a revered Shiite shrine in Samarra, Iraq, last February. The act set off a wave of brutal sectarian violence, the Iraqi national security adviser said. A7    Murder Trial Sought for G.I.'s  An Army investigator has recommended court martial on charges, including murder, that could lead to the death penalty for four infantrymen accused of raping a 14-year-old girl and killing her and her family in March, according to a report. Defense lawyers said they would file objections.  A8    Fish Demand Outstrips Supply  Fish farms are close to matching fishing fleets in supplying seafood to expanding global markets, but both sources of supply taken together are unlikely to keep up with demand fueled by rising populations and incomes, according to a report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.  A6    Islamic School Investigated  British police officers searched the grounds and buildings of the Islamic school Jameah Islameah, continuing the hunt for jihadist recruiters and trainers.

A1    Immigrants Use Identity Theft  Though most people think of identity theft as a financial crime, one of the most common forms involves illegal immigrants using fraudulent Social Security numbers to conduct their daily lives. This practice provides the backbone of some low-wage businesses and a boon to the Social Security trust fund.   A1    Prosecuted Terror Cases Fall  The number of terrorism cases brought by the Justice Department, which surged in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, has dropped sharply since 2002, and prosecutors are turning down hundreds of cases because of weak evidence and other legal problems, according to a new study.   A9    Young Workers Face Hardships  Young people in the nation's work force face a choppy job market, making it hard for many to cope with high housing costs and rising college debt. Entry-level wages are falling, according to the Economic Policy Institute, and the percentage of college graduates receiving health and pension benefits in their early jobs has dropped sharply.   A10    After Polygamist's Arrest  Daily life continues as usual in Colorado City and in the adjacent town of Hildale, where the polygamist leader Warren Jeffs's followers and wives live. Mr. Jeffs is expected to be taken to Washington County, Utah, to stand trial on two counts of rape as an accomplice.   A10    Chicago Fire Kills Six Siblings  An apartment fire on Chicago's North Side killed six siblings.

A10    Governor Race Intensifies  The race to succeed Gov.

A11    Medicare Chief to Resign  Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is set to resign, according to news reports. Dr. McClellan was sworn in as administrator in March 2004 and supervises Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.  A10    NEW YORK/REGION B1-5    Pension Burden Consumes Factory Town's Budget  City officials in Lockport, N.Y., are watching their budget be swallowed by pension and retiree health care costs. Now the mayor is preparing to ask the city's unions for concessions, including curtailing salary increases and cutting benefits. Cities across New York State are only starting to grapple with these ''legacy costs'' and may face similar financial troubles in the future. A1    Trooper Dies From Injuries  Three days after he was ambushed during a hunt for the state's most notorious fugitive, a New York State trooper died from a bullet wound despite efforts to save his life by amputating his leg. Another trooper shot that night is in serious condition and remains in a medically induced coma.  B1    Suozzi Plays Up Long Record  As he takes on Eliot Spitzer for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, Thomas R. Suozzi, left, has seized on a central theme: that he has management skills Mr. Spitzer does not. As proof he cites a long record of accomplishment as Nassau County executive.  B1    Adelphi Sees a Renaissance  A decade after a scandal put its very survival in jeopardy, Adelphi University has turned itself around. Enrollment is up, fund-raising has soared, and bulldozers are breaking ground for the biggest expansion in the college's history.  B1    SPORTSMONDAY D1-8    Agassi Ends Career at Open  It hardly ended with a whimper, yet it ended just the same for Andre Agassi, whose 21-year tennis career came to a close at the United States Open when he lost his third-round match against Benjamin Becker, a German ranked just 112th in the world.

If they knew exactly what they were up to, they probably wouldn't create anything. They'd hang around their lofts or condos or island seats, invite the press in from time to time to issue neatly packaged pronouncements and enjoy a standing, once-a-year invitation to appear on the Dick Cavett Show to bring us up to date on what they'd be doing if, indeed, they ever felt themselves sufficiently mystified by life to do something.   But if artists seldom reveal themselves in the old Q. and A. game, they do have a lot to say not only in their work but also in their observations of - and responses to -the work of others.

The house, which was the home of the commandant of the United States submarine base at Key West, has been empty since the base closed in 1974. So often did Truman visit his retreat -- he made 11 visits for a total of 175 days during his Presidency -- that it became known as the Little White House. President and Mrs. Truman also vacationed there five more times after they left the White House.    Key West officials say the recent renovations to the Little White House, which stands on 2.2 acres, return the building to its appearance in the 1940's. Some of the interior furnishings are original. Visitors find copies of White House correspondence on Truman's desk, some labeled \\"your eyes only,\\" poker chips on the poker table and some of the President's favorite records on the phonograph. A 10-minute video introduces visitors to Truman's experiences in Key West and there are 15-minute guided tours.   The house, (305) 294-9911, at 111 Front Street, off Whitehead Street, is open daily, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $6.
