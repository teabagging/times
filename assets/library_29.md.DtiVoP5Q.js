Mr. Barrymore's knowledge of diction, linked with his splendid acting, overwhelmed the other players, who were evidently handicapped even in their gestures and expressions by the fact that they were aware that they had also to be heard. Such was not the case with Mr. Barrymore, for he is quite at home, and one might also gather, judging by the utterances of the others in the cast, that he had himself improved upon his lines. Once or twice the mechanics of the Vitaphohe failed him, sometimes making his voice a little too resonant and on other occasions giving him more than a suggestion of a lisp.Mr. Barrymore's work alone is a distinct tribute to the persistence of the Warner Brothers in their diligent attempts to produce photoplays with speech, for it demonstrated that with adequate histrionic talent a really laudable picture with speech is not only possible, but virtually on the wing. In each of the three attempts at a speaking picture the Warner Brothers have made strides, but the words spoken in last night's presentation show that they still need far more careful thought given to the writing of the lines.William Collier Jr., May McAvoy and even Alec Francis appear merely to speak their lines so that they can be heard. Their utterances, morever, demonstrate that in giving heed to sound the producers had forgotten human psychology and the consequence is that this trio of performers in what they say, via the Vitaphone are sadly reminiscent of old melodrama days. Also in the matter of direction, Lloyd Bacon has omitted to put sufficient force into the acting of these screen players during those episodes in which they are heard.Mr. Barrymore is marvelously natural and in speaking he really enhances his characterization. But it is quite disappointing to hear the trite and ineffectual words of his colleagues, who, aside from the verbose and melodramatic phrases they utter, look like amateurs compared to Mr. Barrymore. It is also a mistake to have silent sequences and then to hear a character who has been silent suddenly boom forth in speech. This is not so marked in Mr. Barrymore's case, for he is the master of the situation, and there are moments when one is hardly conscious of the mechanical phase of the production, due to the interest in the part created by this truly competent player.It is quite obvious from this Vitaphoned picture that the ordinary screen players, who have been noted for their agreeable presence, will find it necessary to go through a course of stage training before they can deliver competent performances in a Vitaphoned feature.Mr. Barrymore officiates as John Ryder, a powerful and unscrupulous financier. He is the lion. May McAvoy plays the part of Shirley Ross, a Judge's daughter. She is the mouse, the attractive little creature who conquers the adamant spirit of the man of money. From what she says and does in this picture, there is no reason why she should emerge triumphant. She is pretty, but that's all.William Collier Jr. figures as the financier's son, Jefferson Ryder, who is utterly unimpressive in his verbal volley at his father. He talks for the ears of the gallery, or, at least, it seems so, even when he is alone in a huge room with John Ryder.There are some rather good scenes aboard a ship, supposed to be bound from France to New York, and a strenuous effort is made to tickle the risibles of the audience by a feeble-minded Britisher who is overfond of a calabash pipe. This comic character does not utter a word, and neither does Jefferson Ryder's valet, who pops up at different intervals to stir up a little laughter.Four special Vitaphone subjects are presented before the main offering. There are Guss Arnheim and his \\"Ambassadors\\"","excerpt":"the Three Brox Sisters, Myers and Hanford and Giovanni Martinelli. These productions are very good, but Mr. Martinelli's rendition of \\"Va prononcer ma mort\\" from \\"La Juive\\" is by all odds the finest of these features.

With the addition of Technicolor, \\"Smoky,\\" which opened yesterday at the Roxy, is as pretty as a picture card, though not quite as satisfactory a horse romance as it was a dozen years ago when Mr. James himself was on hand to take part in the filming of his story. Mind now, we still think that \\"Smoky\\" is mighty pleasant and refreshing entertainment—in fact, it's just about the best substitute one could make for a day in the country—but somehow the new picture for all its beautiful scenery, doesn't have quite the same kind of simple warmth which distinguished the original. It may be, of course, that this reviewer is slightly prejudiced, since he regards the first \\"Smoky\\" as the finest film of its type ever made.Smoky, standing about sixteen hands at four years, is a magnificently proportioned animal, seal brown in color with a white star on his forehead and as wild and treacherous as the hills which hem the Rocking R Ranch. This then is the story of how Smoky is coaxed into a Rocking R corral by a wandering cowpoke, Clint Barkley, and how Clint gently breaks him to the saddle and teaches Smoky all the useful tricks which a good range horse must know. Smoky remains a rebel to all others, however, and when another cowhand beats him the infuriated stallion tramples him to death and returns to roam the hills. There he is finally hunted down by rodeo riders seeking a wild bronc and after many sad experiences the great horse is sold to a junkman, his spirit by now completely crushed. But Clint eventually finds Smoky and nurses him back to health at the ranch.Fred MacMurray fits the role of the knowing cowboy neatly, and Burl Ives is on hand with his guitar and catalogue of Western folk songs to lend an enchanting, nostalgic atmosphere to the bunk house and night-camp-on-the-range scenes. Mr. Ives sings \\"The Streets of Laredo,\\" \\"Down in the Valley,\\" \\"Blue Tail Fly\\" and \\"Old Dan Tucker.\\" The scenarists have worked in a slight romance with Anne Baxter playing the role of the attractive ranch owner, but \\"Smoky\\" is mostly all blue sky, green grass and a spirited horse. Here is indeed a picture for the family.Taking part in the Roxy's stage show are Donald O'Connor, the film star, with Patsy O'Connor","excerpt":"the Three Swifts, the Belle-Aires, the Gae Foster Girls, and Buster Shaver's midget act featuring Olive, George and Richard.

For a strangely melancholy event, mark your calendars for the closing party, on Jan. 9, when Ms. Kori's balloons will be deflated.    The Phatory, 618 East Ninth Street, East Village; Fridays to Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m.; Wednesdays and Thursdays, 7 to 10 p.m. Closed Christmas Eve to Jan. 4; free.    Monday 12|20    MOD QUEENS  Brini Maxwell, a longtime star of Manhattan public access television, recently graduated to her own home décor and lifestyle program on the Style network. (It can be seen Thursdays at 9 p.m.) Tonight, Ms. Maxwell -- whose (male) birth name is unknown -- takes her peculiar but charming June Cleaver-meets-Heloise shtick to the stage.    Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village; 7 p.m.; $17.    GOOD VIBRATIONS  Oh, mamma mia! While waiting for ''Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others,'' the Morrissey musical, to hit London's stages in July, fans of pop-song theater can make do with ''Good Vibrations.'' The plot, cobbled from Beach Boys songs, features a trim and often swimsuit-clad cast bouncing about the stage. Previews begin.    Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $66 to $91.    FOR RUSSELL BY RUSSELL  A cabaret tribute to Bill Russell (most notable for having written the book and lyrics to ''Side Show,'' everyone's favorite musical about conjoined twins) goes by the hilarious name ''Belters We Have Heard on High.'' Mr. Russell will be joined by Alice Ripley, among others; Ms. Ripley originated the role of Violet Hilton, the twin on the left -- no, right? Anyone?    The Duplex, 61 Christopher Street, West Village; 7 p.m.; $10.    TUESDAY 12|21    A CONSTELLATION OF CELEBRITY  In the week's musical DVD releases, hero worship (pro and con). Kultur releases both ''Frank Sinatra: The Man and the Myth'' and Dean Martin: The One and Only'' (each $19.99). (Related: Deana Martin will discuss ''Memories Are Made of This: Dean Martin Through His Daughter's Eyes,'' her family memoir recording the grim realities of growing up the child of a famous entertainer, on Channel 75 of Sirius satellite radio at 9 p.m.) For the ugly side of mythologizing, there's ''Hype!,'' a 1996 documentary about the rise and fall of Seattle's grunge scene ($14.98, Lions Gate). It includes performances by Gas Huffer, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and the Posies.    REVISITING NUMBERS  Can anyone yet bear to think about politics again? Two flashback programs at the Museum of Television and Radio are voting yes. A 2002 documentary of George W. Bush's first presidential campaign, ''Journeys With George,'' by Alexandra Pelosi, the daughter of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, is paired with ''True Life: I'm a Candidate,'' an 80-minute episode from the MTV series ''True Life'' that follows two young Congressional candidates in 2000: Dylan Glenn, a black Republican who just lost a re-election bid in Georgia, and John Cranley, who a year after his loss was elected to the City Council in Cincinnati. 25 West 52nd Street, Manhattan; 12:30 p.m. (Tuesdays through Sundays, with an additional 5:30 p.m. screening on Thursdays); $5 to $10. (Through Jan. 9.)    WEDNESDAY 12|22    DVD'S: CANDIDATES AND ZOMBIES  Just out: Kevin Kline's turn as Cole Porter in ''De-Lovely'' ($26.98, MGM) and Meryl Streep's turn as a Senator Who Is Not Based on Hillary Rodham Clinton, Honest, in ''The Manchurian Candidate'' ($29.95, Paramount). Cult hit releases include ''Napoleon Dynamite'' ($29.98, 20th Century Fox) and ''Shaun of the Dead'' ($29.98, Universal). For TV collectors, there's ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' ($49.98, Fox Home Entertainment, broadcast in 1993 and 1994) and ''Star Trek Voyager: The Complete Seventh Season'' ($129.99, Paramount Home Entertainment), that show's satisfying conclusion, with a temporally overlapping Captain and Admiral Janeway.    TALES OF THE ECHO  A Japanese melding of movement-based theater styles, ''Tales of the Echo'' draws on child-friendly fables, channeling them through an array of forms like Butoh and even Takarazuka, an all-female performance style that has much in common with the artificial glamour and elaborate movement of drag performance.    TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street; 2 p.m.; $15 to $23. (Also on Monday and Tuesday, at 8 p.m.)    LAST- MINUTE CULTURE GIFTS  The Museum of Modern Art's design stores -- at 81 Spring Street and at the museum itself on West 53rd Street -- will stay open on Christmas Eve until 6 p.m. Broadway.com offers gift certificates for any show the service sells on Broadway or the West End: those are $120, although the buyer will be refunded any unused money if cheaper tickets are bought. Lincoln Center gift certificates are available at www.lincolncenter.org. And for the most pure of heart, PBS gift memberships are available at www.thirteen.org.    THURSDAY 12|23    SINGING HIS WAY HOME  In the film ''Swades,'' Mohan Bhargava (played by Shahrukh Khan, a major Indian cinema star) leaves his hot-shot job at NASA to return to India in search of his childhood nanny. Along the way, he rekindles a romance and breaks into song. Sort of like a Julia Roberts-Ricky Martin love story with a cross-cultural backdrop, but in Hindi, with English subtitles.    ImaginAsian Theater, 239 East 59th Street, Manhattan; 1, 5:30 and 9:30 p.m.; $10; $8 for children. (Ends today.)    IN DARGER'S WORLD  ''In the Realms of the Unreal,'' directed by Jessica Yu, is a film about Henry Darger, the outsider artist who died in the early 1970's and left behind a huge body of previously unseen work, including a 15,000-page illustrated novel. But it's less a documentary than an interpretation of his aesthetic; it uses animation to set us adrift in Darger's private world.    Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village; $10; $5 for members. (Through Jan 4; opens at the Castro Theater in San Francisco on Friday.)    THE GOOD GUEST APPEARANCE  A sighting of the actress Julia Stiles -- who appeared in Matt Damon's ''Bourne'' action series and ''Save the Last Dance,'' the ''Bring It On'' of the ballet set -- comes free with purchase after the Eve Ensler play ''The Good Body.'' The surprisingly politically minded Ms. Stiles will talk with Ms. Ensler, the creator of the ''Vagina Monologues.'' ''The Good Body'' will close on Jan. 2.    Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $81.25.    FRIDAY 12|24    ON THE RADIO  This week, Jim Caruso's ''Cast Party,'' an Internet radio program and a live Monday-night event at Birdland that's devoted to the Broadway and cabaret scenes, engages the young musical composer Georgia Stitt. On broadcast, Ms. Stitt's work will be sung by some of the Young Turks of Broadway -- Julia Murney, Andrea Burns, Lauren Kennedy, Susan Egan. On Dec. 27 at 7 p.m., Ms. Stitt and friends will appear at Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton.    www.broadwayworld.com/radio.cfm; 8 p.m.    BOYS' CHOIR, BEFORE VACATION  At 4 p.m., St. Thomas Church will offer its annual service of lessons and carols; both the men's and boys' choirs will perform works by 20th-century composers: Sir David Willcocks, the former long-time musical director of the Bach Choir in London; John Scott (who is also St. Thomas's newly appointed organist and music director); and others. At 10:30 p.m., festival music for trumpet, organ and strings will be performed with the period-instrument quartet Concert Royal, followed by Solemn Eucharist of the Nativity. The boys of the choir school will be sent home on Christmas Day, so Saturday's 11 a.m. service is your last chance to see them this year.    Fifth Avenue, at 53rd Street, Manhattan; free.    SNEAKING ONTO BROADWAY  Many Broadway shows are dark for Christmas Eve -- even actors must go home and play the role of Santa -- but some shows have added special matinees. For Christmas Day, it's the inverse: many Saturday matinees are canceled, but evening shows are a go. The TKTS booth just north of Times Square -- the land of discounted, same-day tickets -- will be open from 3 to 8 p.m.; the South Street Seaport location will be closed. On Christmas Day, the TKTS booth near Times Square will sell tickets for evening shows from 3 to 8 p.m.; the Seaport location will be open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. There's no way to predict what bargains there will be, but as of press time, tickets were available through online ticketing agencies like Telecharge and Ticketmaster for the Christmas Day shows, including ''The Producers,'' ''Laugh Whore,'' ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''Brooklyn the Musical'' and many others.    SATURDAY 12|25    'WHAT I LIKE ABOUT JEW'  This is the fifth annual outing for ''What I Like About Jew,'' a comedy-cabaret revue. With the songwriter Sean Altman and Rob Tannenbaum, the music editor of Blender magazine, as hosts, the show will feature the cafe musician Eric Schwartz and the comedian Todd Barry. Note: Al Goldstein, former publisher of Screw magazine and now former employee of the Second Avenue Deli, will perform at the show on Thursday.    Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa; 8 and 10:30 p.m.; $12 to $14.    DOWNTOWN TRADITIONS ON THE RADIO  For those yearning for an old-fashioned Christmas feel, huddle around the wireless Internet for radio programming on WFUV. From 1 to 3 p.m., there are highlights of six years of performances of the untraditional tradition ''The Downtown Messiah,'' including performances by David Johansen, the former New York Dolls frontman. Over on PS1 radio, this week marks the station's debut of ''Evening Air,'' with the night-life impresarios Chi Chi Valenti and Johnny Dynell: the show's opening salvo is to reinterpret ''War of the Worlds,'' starring the singer Deborah Harry and a host of muggers and hams.    WFUV: 90.7 FM in New York; nationally at www.wfuv.org. WPS1: www.wps1.org.    THE UN-XMAS MOVIE ROUNDUP: CHILD MOLESTERS AND JEWISH COMEDIANS  Decidedly un-Yule movie choices: Kevin Bacon's turn as a child molester in ''The Woodsman,'' opening Christmas Eve, in limited release. ''Darkness,'' a movie about a house haunted by the massacre of children, is in general release. For lighter fare, your best choice is, as always, Barbra, in 1968's ''Funny Girl'' at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater.    Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, East Village; 7 p.m.; $9.

Like Julius Erving's revolutionary dunks and the Indiana Pacers' Boston Celtics-like championship esprit de corps. Or the San Diego Conquistadors' coach, Wilt Chamberlain, who described one of his players as a \\"fat pig\\" and once showed up for a game at halftime.

And fun it is for a nice stretch, as the boys comport themselves expansively. One handsome youngster, Martin Lartigue, draws attention as the youngest and most charming of the lot.Eventually, like real war, the whole thing becomes repetitious and monotous, and one senses a bit too much attention to nudity and dirty words. Yves Robert, who directed and co-produced the picture with his wife, Daniele Delorme, has intruded, indeed, a few quick shots that are questionable as humor and good taste. Also dropped into the English subtitles are a couple of slangy words that are still a little startling for the movies, even though less blunt than the French dialogue.I happen to be one who remembers a previous French film, version of the Pergaud novel, shown here in 1938 under the title of \\"Generals Without Buttons.\\" As I recall, it was a more amusing film.Also on the bill at the Little Carnegie is a 13-minute color film called \\"The Reality of Karel Appel,\\" describing the works of the well-known Dutch painter.

The tiny parasite, made infamous from Nantucket to Minnesota for its ability to transmit Lyme disease, has now been shown to harbor a lethal bacterial illness, called human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, or H.G.E.     The human infection, first identified in several dozen cases in Wisconsin and Minnesota, has stricken a dozen residents of New York City suburbs in the first few weeks of this year's summer tick-bite season. The infection can cause sudden severe flu-like symptoms and, if not treated with the appropriate antibiotics, can become life-threatening, researchers say.     Previously implicated in at least four deaths, H.G.E. is suspected most recently in the case of a New York man who ended up the intensive care unit at a New York City hospital last month. He quickly healed once the right drugs took hold.    It's possible for a single tick bite to transmit Lyme, H.G.E., and even perhaps a third known infectious organism, a protozoan called babesia, said Dr. J. Stephen Dumler, a microbiologist at the University of Maryland, who is testing for H.G.E. infections using DNA analysis similar to that used in the O.J.

Barry returns to the imaginary town of Jericho, R.I., modeled on the place of his childhood, to explore the battles of another of those families that intrigue him: families whose members find their competition with one another so engrossing they scarcely notice, until it is too late, that they may be doing irreparable damage to people outside their ranks.   The characters in this, the 8th of what Mr. Barry intends to be a 12-play Jericho cycle, are tough and fascinating and the dialogue is often rich, cutting and witty.

For example, referring to my account of Arthur Hays Sulzberger, then the publisher of The New York Times, Leiter writes: ''She . . . treats Sulzberger's anti-Zionism like some evil aberration. There were many Jews who agreed with him, some of them even in Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration.'' Yet a quick perusal of my index reveals 50 pages devoted to explaining that Sulzberger's anti-Zionism arose from his involvement with Reform Judaism, including an entire chapter on Sulzberger's alliance with the Reform rabbis who founded the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism.    More tellingly, Leiter avoids coming to grips with any of the evidence I provide concerning The Times's coverage, preferring merely to repeat the conventional wisdom that ''the extent of the killing'' of European Jews ''could not have been fathomed'' by ''Sulzberger or any other newspaper executive.'' Then how does Leiter explain the nearly 1,200 New York Times articles that chronicle in terrifying detail the destruction of Europe's Jews, including ones that tally the mounting death toll and describe the precise methods of murder? (Again, a look at the index's 24 separate entries under ''New York Times news coverage of extermination campaign'' might have helped.) Or the Times editorials that treat the news as ''officially established facts'' (18 index entries)? Or the dozens of contemporaneous comments I quote, from Sulzberger and others, acknowledging what was happening to the Jews in Europe?    Finally, and most astonishingly, Leiter suggests that I don't understand my own title, which he writes has a ''particular but unintended resonance,'' in that ''the Holocaust was an issue buried by the times in which the participants lived.'' Of course the Holocaust was buried by the times, but it was also buried by The Times. The times can't really be held to account","excerpt":"The Times can and should be -- as some of its more recent editors have acknowledged -- despite Leiter's calculated effort to let the newspaper off the hook.

But his earlier support for the move - and his reasons for dropping it - are worth examining for the light they shed on economic policy and how it is made.   Although Mr. Reagan and his economic aides proclaim John Maynard Keynes as the evil, inflationary spirit of the second half of the 20th century, the President's plan to move up the date of the tax cut was Keynesian: a proclaimed measure to check the recession and stimulate the economy into recovery.   To be sure, Mr. Reagan could fall back on the original ''supply side'' logic of cutting personal income taxes as a means of spurring productivity, savings and investment. Or he might seek to justify the acceleration of the tax cut with his fundamental ideology of lowering tax revenues as a means of forcing Congress to chop Federal social programs, leaving aside his demands for Congressional support of a rapid military buildup.

At the Biltmore, where the Manhattan Theater Club is presenting Elaine May's ''After the Night and the Music,'' Mr. Stasiewicz pays tribute to one of the evening's themes with a gin-based drink called Take My Wife.    He says that a lot of research goes into his cleverly written drink menus. He reads the plays before they open and starts experimenting with ingredients. When there's a book involved, as with Lincoln Center's ''Light in the Piazza,'' he reads that, too. He also keeps up with the liquor industry's latest trendy liqueurs and flavors. His biggest hit, he said, was the Frolicking Frog, a rum-based drink tinted green with Midori and garnished with a lime-slice lily pad and a candy frog, devised last year for the Lincoln Center production of ''The Frogs.'' ''People went crazy,'' he said.    Most of Mr. Stasiewicz's inventions cost $10 -- ''Everyone hates the prices,'' Ms. Rose said -- though patrons who buy one before the curtain can get a second at intermission for half price if they preorder. Ms. Rose, who splits her proceeds with the house, was reluctant to divulge any specific financial arrangements, but Mr. Stasiewicz didn't mind sharing his recipes. Above is one of his current leading cocktails.   SYLVIANE GOLD    THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA    2 ounces citron vodka  1 ounce limoncello liqueur  1 teaspoon superfine sugar, plus more for rimming the glass a dash of lemon juice (optional)  1 ounce sparkling wine  1 thin slice of lemon    Combine the vodka, limoncello and teaspoon of sugar, adding lemon juice, if desired, in a chilled cocktail shaker.

Solomon in all of his glory is there, too, in a great deal of glory—much more, in fact, than Mr. Wells and even more generous historians would allow him—and some gory, too.The picture is another effort to win by astonishment. Everything that could be thought of by J. Gordon Edwards, the director, and others that would amaze, startle and shock those eager or able to be shocked seems to have been crowded into it. It is ornate, elaborate and spectacular, and, with the orchestra, going full blast frequently, has many of the characteristics of a gorgeous circus. For although Roman chariot races might have been something new to Solomon, a stirring one is staged before him, which, incidentally, reaches into modern times by suggesting the origin of the feminist movement. The Princess Vashti challenges the Queen of Sheba to the first race between women, and, of course, Sheba wins. That's the only trouble with the contest. It would have been much more thrilling if Vashti had surprised everybody by coming out ahead. It would have spoiled the story, but that would not have mattered much, for the story does not count, anyhow. Every thing is astonishment and Vashti's victory would have been astonishing.No mention is made in the picture of Solomon's multitude of wives, but there is on the other hand, no suggestion that he didn't like women around his court. It looks as if the Ziegfeld Frolic had been borrowed for the production. They are splendiferous, and—well, Palestine is a warm country, and it's a good thing Southern California is, too. Otherwise it is probable that the film would have been responsible for several cases of pneumonia—that worn by the girls, not the celluloid.The story is spread around an intense romance between Solomon and Sheba. Betty Blythe is the Sheba, and Fritz Lieber is the Solomon. Others in the cast are Clarie De Lopez, George Siegmann, G. R. Nye, Joan Gordon, Nell Craig and Fat Moore.The Strand is celebrating its seventh anniversary this week with a program including an overture from \\"Maytime,\\" with a vocal number sung by Estelle Carey","excerpt":"the Topical Review; \\"A Birthday Cake,\\" with the Strand Male Quartet: R. A. Walsh's \\"The Oath,\\" and Buster Keaton's latest comedy, \\"Neighbors.\\"The photoplay, \\"The Oath,\\" is one of those productions that leave the spectator unsatisfied, with the impression that it could have been a great deal better, but might have been much worse. Its story, for instance, begins promisingly, with more emphasis on character than mechanical plot, and soon wins the interest; but as it develops its characters become more and more incredible and its plot more obtrusive and illogical. It sets out to present a problem arising from the marriage of a Gentile with a Jewess, but lets in so many extraneous questions that the problem is soon obscured in a confusion of issues, and the central situation in which its climax is reached is built around what seems an entirely fictitious assumption. Here it is:Hugh Coleman, an impecunious young man, has secretly married Minna Hart, the daughter of a wealthy Jewish banker, from whom Coleman has borrowed money. One night the young man has an interview with the banker in which he hopes to lead up to the announcement of his marriage by asking permission to marry Minna. The father refuses to give his consent, however, saying that he would rather see his daughter dead than married to a Gentile, and Coleman, professing to understand his point of view, and expressing regret that he cannot drop the whole subject, withdraws to the daughter's room to learn that she has overheard the conversation and considers him a coward for not telling her father that they are married. She sends him away after exacting from him a solemn oath never to divulge their marriage to any one.After Coleman has left the house, the banker is murdered, but his body is not found until the next morning. It is known that Coleman was with him as late as 11 o'clock the night before and did not reach his own home until 6 o'clock in the morning, so he is asked to account for the hours during which the murder must have been committed. As he had spent part of this time with his wife, he cannot answer the question without violating his oath, and this he will not do. So he is arrested for the crime, and the action then proceeds on the assumption that, if either he or the girl made public the fact of their marriage and, with it, the fact that he had gone to his wife's room after leaving her father, the accused man would be cleared.But why? Suppose the facts had been given. Wouldn't they have shown that a penniless man had married the daughter of a wealthy banker, who was violently opposed to their union, and whose death had removed the only obstacle to their desire and delivered a fortune into their hands? Would not a motive for the crime have been established, with the daughter under suspicion as an accomplice? Does not the plot break down here in its very centre?But in the midst of many things that seem to deny logic, one sees Miriam Cooper as Minna and Conway Tearle as Hugh Coleman giving intelligibility and sometimes distinction to their parts. Some of their scenes, taken alone, are convincing as selections of dramatic reality. And the others in the cast are satisfactory, especially Robert Fisher, as the banker, and Anna Q. Nilsson, as a woman whom the plot makes impossible.Also, Mr. Walsh has made many striking moving pictures, skillfully set and lighted, but his best efforts have been weakened by a lack of judicious restraint. He appreciates, apparently, the dramatic value of scenes in sharply contrasting blacks and whites, but such scenes are made by a simple trick of lighting and if they are repeated too often in a single photoplay they become commonplace and lose their effectiveness. In \\"The Oath\\" they are almost a habit.The subtitles of the picture, credited to Ralph Spence, are frequent and flowery, thereby calling unfavorable attention to themselves, rather than serving the pictures they accompany.The photoplay is an adaptation of William J. Locke's \\"Idols.\\"The Buster Keaton comedy is a boisterously amusing piece of slapstick, bright in places, and more crude in others than is necessary with a clown of Mr. Keaton's ability on hand to get laughs.\\"Proxies,\\" with Zena Keefe and Norman Kerry, directed by George D.

These winds continue blowing northeast across the subcontinent. Along the way, their clouds may dump water on some places and pass over others, but the real downpours occur when the winds encounter the high Himalayas in northern India and, as a consequence, rise to cooler altitudes, where their vapor condenses into water.

The story follows three mounted policemen and an Aboriginal tracker on a mission to bring to justice a black man accused of murdering a white woman. The characters have symbolic names like the Tracker, the Fanatic, the Follower, the Veteran and the Fugitive. Gary Sweet's Fanatic is as scary a racist fiend as has ever been brought to the screen. David Gulpilil's Tracker, who is a bridge between the Aboriginal and white societies, exudes the same aura of mystical watchfulness and omniscience that he brought to the movies &quot;Walkabout,&quot; &quot;The Last Wave&quot; and &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence.'' The story is strung around a 10-song suite of narrative ballads, and  handsome mural-like illustrations by Peter Coad that deepen its mythical flavor. — Stephen Holden A Ballad About Hunting a Fugitive and Finding Evil"},{"year":"2005","title":"Rilo Kiley      For the cheerfully ridiculous music video ''Portions for Foxes'' (watch it at mtv.com), this Los Angeles indie-rock band takes over a taxidermist's studio. As Jenny Lewis sings about a love affair that unfolds as a chain reaction (''And the talking leads to touching/And the touching leads to sex/And then there is no mystery left''), things get a bit messy (why is the air filled with feathers?), and by the time the song builds to a glorious, bittersweet peak (''You're bad news/Baby, you're bad news''), she's laughing.    Isolée      Isolée is the German micro-house producer Rajko Müller, who galvanized a small band of obsessives with his meticulous 2000 album ''Rest''","excerpt":"the tracks were propulsive and mysterious and utterly addictive, even though they seemed to consist of little more than echoey blips. Extracting those blips from a computer must be time-consuming -- only now, five years later, do we get the gorgeous follow-up, ''We Are Monster'' (Playhouse). (The disc is available in America at www.forcedexposure.com.) This album is looser and more rubbery than its predecessor, but no less difficult to pin down: ''Schrapnell'' coyly entertains musical suitors (new wave, disco, dub) without accepting a proposal; ''Face B'' celebrates the huge gap between its ominous sub-bass line and its gleaming, chiming keyboards. Mr. Müller's tracks seem to change shape with the volume nob. ''We Are Monster'' is one of the year's best electronic albums; here's hoping American listeners find a way to hear it.    Alkaline Trio      This great Chicago punk trio is obsessed with blood and with the organ that pumps it. In 2003 the group released its fourth album, ''Good Mourning,'' one of the highlights of that year's emo explosion: the members found ways to build roaring love songs out of tidy punk-rock riffs and horror-movie lyrics. (The album's first words were, ''I've got a book of matches/I've got a can or kerosene/I've got some bright ideas involving you and me.'') The follow-up is ''Crimson'' (Vagrant/Interscope), and the producer Jerry Finn (whose résumé ranges from blink-182 to Morrissey) has helped the band exchange speed for size. Some of the supersizing seems unnecessary; it's by no means clear that these guys really need a string section. But the best songs snarl and swoon as well as any in the band's catalog. Best of all, the members haven't lost their appetite for shameless punch lines. In ''Mercy Me,'' Matt Skiba, the guitarist and lead singer, goes from melancholy to something meaner: ''Drive yourself insane tonight/It's not that far away/And I just filled up your tank earlier today.''    Animal Collective & Vashti    Bunyan      In one of the season's least surprising collaborations, the lightheaded strummers in Animal Collective teamed up with Ms. Bunyan, a pioneer among lightheaded strummers, ever since her cult 1970 album ''Just Another Diamond Day.'' She and they joined to record a new mini-album, ''Prospect Hummer,'' propelled by giddy but quiet vocal harmonies and, yes, lots of strumming. It all comes together at the very end, during a two-minute song called, ''I Remember Learning How to Dive.'' It begins with tapping, then Ms. Bunyan exhales the lyrics, singing a playful song where the phrases coyly decline to fall into line with the beat.    R. Kelly      Grab a pen. One of pop music's weirdest geniuses is back, not merely with a new single but with a five-part operetta called ''Trapped in the Closet'' (Jive). Part 1, released to radio about a month ago, began normally enough: a husband surprises his wife at home, her lover (our narrator) makes a hurried journey from bed to closet, a cellphone rings at the worst possible moment, the lover palms his pistol and hopes for the best. In the new episode, Part 2, husband and lover face off: ''He steps a little closer, I point my gun and says, 'I'm not the one you after'/He says, 'Something I bet you didn't know, my man: Did she tell you I was a pastor?''' (Perhaps no one but Mr. Kelly could turn those words into a silky R&B couplet.) Let's not give away any surprise endings; let's just note, for now, that the title is well chosen.    Jay-Z      As it happens, Mr. Kelly's old friend and ex-tourmate and recent legal adversary Jay-Z has returned, too: the semi-retired rapper has a great new track, ''Dear Summer'' (Roc-A-Fella/Island Def Jam). But it comes at a high price: $13.98, to be exact. The track is only available on ''534,'' the new album from Jay-Z's competent but rarely thrilling protégé Memphis Bleek. Over a wistful sample (an old Lenny White song, resuscitated by the producer Just Blaze), Jay-Z pays tribute to the season he'll sit out. He begins by reminiscing (''Dear summer, I know you gon' miss me ''), but soon he's back to the usual, tweaking his detractors but never deigning to hate them: ''They like the drunk uncles in your family/You know they lame/You feel ashamed/But you love 'em the same.''

The great archeological monuments of the period, most notably the palace complex of the Alhambra in Granada, are Islamic Spain's most familiar and conspicuous remnants. But its art remains little known and, especially in the absence of an important scholarly center devoted to Islamic culture in Spain itself, little studied. It has not helped matters that so much of the Islamic legacy was systematically destroyed by the Christians who reconquered Spain, nor that the art that remains is dispersed around the world, much of it in places well off the beaten path.

The Nuestra Senora de Atocha, laden with 29 tons of silver and 3,500 ounces of gold, foundered on Sept. 6, 1622, with the loss of 143 lives.   The bulk of its cargo, a wall of silver ingots, was discovered last week by Melvin Fisher, after a 15-year search.

In ''DAYS OF HEAVEN,'' his second film, released in 1978, after which he disappeared for 20 years, Mr. Malick and NÉSTOR ALMENDROS, the principal photographer, created pictures that had the texture of pigment on canvas. Almendros, who died in 1992, wrote about his conscious effort to capture the look of Vermeer paintings in the film. To achieve that atmospheric richness, much of the film, set in the Texas Panhandle on the eve of World War I, was shot in the hour before sundown.    Starting on Friday, Film Forum is showing ''Days of Heaven'' in a new 35-millimeter print. In it, the young RICHARD GERE is Bill, a factory worker who leaves his job in Chicago to travel to the Panhandle to harvest the wheat of a wealthy farmer (SAM SHEPARD), who lives in an isolated prairie house that might have been painted by Edward Hopper. With him come his 12-year-old sister, Linda (LINDA MANZ), who narrates the movie, and his secret lover, Abby (BROOKE ADAMS), whom he passes off as another sister.

And with their states facing budget deficits that require many other painful steps, the timing isn't great. But Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey and Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York can no longer deny the need for a $1 toll increase on bridges and tunnels run by the Port Authority.   A plan submitted by the agency's new director, Stanley Brezenoff, would increase round-trip tolls from $3 to $4 early next year on four bridges and two tunnels. Commuters who buy monthly passes would pay $72 for a 20-trip package, up from the present $40. The $1 fare on PATH trains would rise to $1.25.    A similar proposal by Mr. Brezenoff's predecessor died last spring after a chilly response from the two Governors, who share veto power over any toll increase. About $100 million in essential capital improvements had to be postponed. Further delay could risk the region's long-term economic health.   The interstate transportation network operates at a heavy deficit, and revenues from the region's airports and from the World Trade Center, also operated by the Port Authority, can no longer provide big subsidies. Those facilities urgently require major renovations themselves.   The Automobile Club of New York complains about charging automobile commuters more to cover PATH's operating losses. But the proposed $4 toll is still a relative bargain","excerpt":"the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority charges $5 round-trip on its crossings. Moreover, drivers clearly benefit when commuters are diverted from congested roadways and onto mass transit.    The task may be politically difficult.

It takes space, lots of space. You can't dance the Texas two-step in the living room, even with the furniture pushed against the wall. You could Texas two-step the length of Oregon in less than a week, dancing nights, sleeping under junipers during the heat of the day.\\n\\nFrank and I are learning country-western dancing in the gym at the Presbyterian church Thursday nights. One of our teachers pulls out a microphone and tells us what to do. O.K. Sweetheart position. Couples face each other and grab hold. Start with your right foot. Everybody gotcher right foot? Aww-raaht. Now.\\n She hugged me and kissed me and called me her dandy","excerpt":"The Trinity's muddy, the Brazos quicksandy.\\n\\nI hugged her and kissed her and called her my own;\\n\\nBut down by the Brazos she left me alone. \\n\\nThe first thing you learn in a country-western class is dance-floor etiquette. The basic rule is keep moving or get out of the way. Fancy stuff in the center of the circle. On the outside, movement -- fast, spinning if you want, but still moving, counterclockwise. Ladies walk backward, men walk forward.\\n\\nThe second thing is, the man is in charge. It's always the lady who turns, moving fast so she's back in position when he reaches for her hand, always the lady who moves her cowboy boots double time, step, step, quickstep -- pointy toes, undershot heels, tiny things, sexy as hell. Backing away from her gentleman, watching his jaw for the tightening muscle that will tell her she's about to spin 360 degrees, a lady knows that when he pulls her toward him, he's getting ready to flick his arm and pitch her out, sidearm, like a stone skipping over a river.\\n\\nThe men dance with hats on, the ladies without. The way the lady ducks and tucks, a hat would get sent across the dance floor first spin. Instead, the ladies wear hair. Texas-size hair curled with a drugstore perm on pink rods so it sort of crinkles down their backs. The men wear Levis and boots with two-inch heels that boost up their rumps and bend their knees and give them a swayback, swaggering stance like an out-to-pasture racehorse that has won its share of races. \\n\\nWe don't really fit in, Frank and I. I think it's his fault because he won't wear his part of our his-and-her shirts. He wears oxford-cloth shirts instead -- the only man on the dance floor with white buttons instead of mother-of-pearl snaps. I think I've got the clothes right, but I'll always have schoolteacher hair. We're probably too stiff, too self-conscious, the sort who would never make love with the horses watching. If we had horses. Or maybe our politics are wrong. But how do they know we voted for gun control? How do they know that I don't let dogs in my living room or that I get my back up when strangers call me honey? When the music stops, the crowd parts silently around us and rejoins, like a flock of sparrows avoiding a telephone pole.\\n\\nWe are immigrants to the West -- emigrants from Cleveland. But we have lived in Oregon for 20 years now, and you would think that would count for something. We brag about the West as if we had created it; we plant trees and chop them down with an ax; we seek out every isolated river valley and learn the calls of the birds. But a sense of connection eludes us, and like other immigrants, we live for those small, transcendent moments that may exist only in the imagination, when we will belong completely and perfectly to a way of life embedded in this land.\\n\\nWe are taking intermediate dance, having taken beginning three times before we got the courage to move on. We are learning the cowboy waltz. This is familiar territory, so we don't have to think about the steps. Instead, we can move to the music and listen to the words, which are so hopeless that I waltz along with tears in my eyes. \\n\\nLi-li-li-lil-lil-ly, give me your hand.\\n\\nThere's many a river that waters the land. \\n\\nReal trouble doesn't come until they try to teach us windows. We're facing our partners and holding hands. We're supposed to start moving our feet in the regular pattern. Step, step, back-step! Step, step, back-step. Then the gentleman pulls all four hands together and -- step, step, back-step -- lifts them over his head. By this time he's got the lady strung up like a side of beef, and he pivots his wrists, which means she must spin two and a half times, or her arms will break off at the elbows. Don't stop moving your feet. Then he lowers his elbows to shoulder level, and the two of them parade around with their arms framing open space that's supposed to look like cabin windows with the glass shot out. Couples are frozen in hellish contortions. Only the music moves on.\\n\\nThe instructor snaps off the CD player, but it's too late. The cowboys and ranch wives have already been transformed into ordinary people like ourselves. Not cattlemen, not ranch hands, but accountants and truck salesmen and nurses and, yes, professors, all thinking that if they could just remember to start with their right foot, if they could just put on their ceremonial clothing and immerse themselves in the beat, they would move their feet in patterns dictated by ancient practice and the rhythm of slide guitars and find what they are looking for.\\n\\nI want to be lifted off the linoleum of the gym floor and set down, dancing, on a wood plank floor while a fiddler is sawing away, keeping time with his hips, and a little cowboy is singing the truth as he knows it. Ladies' skirts are swinging, and men are stomping, and fat, pretty babies are sleeping on feather beds in the corners of the barn, sighing in their sleep. Outside are wolves and droughts and prairie fires, but we don't care because the air in the barn is music, and music is whisky.\\n\\nExcept that the janitor comes in and whispers something to the teacher. She stops the music and asks if everyone would kindly remove their boots, as they are making black marks on the linoleum. Boots line up like hopeful teen-agers along the edges of the dance floor.

Failing only in its choppy continuity from achieving the overpowering effect of that previous Russian epic of last Winter's bitter warfare, \\"Moscow Strikes Back,\\" this film is, nonetheless, a graphic survey of the misery, hunger and death the city endured and a moving tribute to the valor of its soldiers and civilians.Of all the great sieges in history which words have inadequately described, this siege of Leningrad was the first to be reported in all its wretched detail by the eye of the motion-picture camera. And, as a consequence, this one-hour film is a unique historical document as well as a harrowing illustration of facts. During the frightful months of last Winter, twenty-three camera men went about the beleaguered city, into the fighting lines and even behind, where the guerrillas were persisting, to film in stark detail this story of a city's Gethsemane. They pictured agonies too terrible to tell.They caught such heart-rending scenes as were typical of life in that frozen city—of people trudging doggedly with their few belongings through the snow, of women dipping water from an open gutter in the street, of mothers feeding their children little scraps of food, of long lines waiting patiently for pitiful rations of bread. In one of the desolate street scenes may be seen a man and woman drawing a little sled on which is mutely limbered a telltale tiny corpse. In another scene, a boy of no more than 10 or 12, all alone, pulls his sled through the white snow with a plain black coffin on it. The fact that no one even notices is grim testimony to the familiarity of the sight.The camera men also caught glimpses of the famous road which was built across the ice of near-by Lake Ladoga, which was Leningrad's fragile lifeline, and of the huge trucks (and even trains) which brought in the food and ammunition that way. (The last trucks to come through are pictured in water up to the hubs, with rotten ice floating about them and the whole road in peril of collapse.) They went up to front-line positions and filmed white-clad snipers picking off the foe, caught long files of German prisoners looking hollow and woe-begone, and followed, with cameras turning, the guerrilla fighters as they stalked the Nazi rear.All of these pictures—and others—have been put together to form this tragic, exalting record of the ordeal of Leningrad. The editing is loose and sometimes clumsy, the English commentary is barely adequate and is spoken by Edward R. Murrow in an oddly casual tone. But the pictures themselves are the record","excerpt":"the Trojan story they tell is blunt enough. As Mr. Murrow concludes, this is your evidence of the ultimate meaning and sacrifice of total war.

Scaffolding in the shape of a mock proscenium descended as well, lighted up as if Christmas had arrived, framing the pastel heavens. And finally the carriage of Dr. Dulcamara rolled onstage, pulled by cardboard horses nearly as pink and white as the clouds surrounding them.

Donizetti wrote the work in less than two months to restore his reputation as a composer of popular hits after an operatic failure (\\"Ugo\\"). If the score is played with just the right touch of simplicity, stylish grace and virtuosic ease, the audience should feel that the true elixir is not the quack's potion or the money the peasant Nemorino inherits that wins him the attentions of every girl in the village, but the florid seductions of the music itself.

The former owners of Huberts on Park Avenue, which closed last year, moved downtown to smaller and less costly quarters, hired a bare-bones staff and opened a restaurant that defies a simple label.   What do you call a place that on one menu offers shrimp with radish pudding and Chinese sausage, goat cheese lasagna, Indonesian-style veal-shank stew, and roast chicken with lemon -- the United Nations? They call it Onda.   The mahogany-lined rectangular dining room is as offbeat as the food. Bronze candle sconces and little religious paintings line the walls while the Shirelles coo over the sound system. Well-spaced tables are draped in paper, reinforcing the relaxed theme. Servers are casually attired, taking a cue from the gregarious manager, who comes to your table wearing a plaid sport shirt, a nascent beard and a little gold fish dangling from one ear. Hey, this place could be fun.   And it is fun if you order the right dishes, but doing that takes some investigation. Many of the menu items have two prices, one as an appetizer, one as a main course. This is a good idea for those who like to mix and match. An appetizer of sauteed tenderloin of pork is pleasing, the thin slices of meat served on skewers with a spicy peanut sauce and a cooling cucumber salad. Roasted peanuts resurface in a melange of Chinese rice-stick noodles with butterflied shrimp, tofu and bean sprouts. It's a lively combination, on the sweet side, with good textural contrast. The sweet tooth is sated again in the soft-shell crabs with a sweet-hot sauce of fish stock, sake, red pepper and chili pepper.   A nice communal munchie is the crisply fried baby calamari with pungent tamarind sauce. Pastas also can be a starter or a main course. Lasagna with sun-dried tomatoes, bound with a mortar of dense goat cheese, was too heavy and assertive. You might instead try the pansotti, a Ligurian ravioli that is filled with spinach and enlivened with a pastelike sauce of ground walnuts and herbs.   Onda has a small but well-selected wine inventory. Prices are very modest across the board. You might try the fruity, dry 1988 Chinon from Domaine de la Chapellerie ($19) with succulent roasted quails that are oddly paired with a Chinatown-style egg roll filled with cabbage, carrots and Chinese greens. Roasted chicken with a parsley puree under the skin, asparagus and lemon garnish is deftly done. It is crisp outside and moist within, sitting in a clear lemony broth.   Another good choice is a twist on osso buco, sinewy but tender veal shank with a rich, sweetish caramelized onion sauce and toasted polenta sticks. The indelicate Indonesian veal-shank stew, however, is overpowered by coconut milk. The Chinese-style roasted duck is probably the best effort of all, served with bok choy and water chestnuts.   Seafood does not fare so well. Fried red snapper Thai style with scallops and roasted sweet pepper is colorful but bland, and the highly perfumed steamed flounder with ginger and scallion has nothing over what might be served at a run-of-the-mill Cantonese restaurant.   The ingenuous summer desserts are more fun than throwing your sister into a swimming pool. The banana splits reminded me of my teen-age pigouts on a Jersey Shore boardwalk, and the hot fudge sundae is just as excessive, sans bananas. Chocolate rum espresso cheesecake is every bit as iniquitous as it sounds. Lemon pound cake was crumbly dry on one tasting, better the next time.   Onda's funky international approach to budget dining may not be to everyone's taste. But if the idea of a culinary Cook's Tour intrigues you, it can be recommended. Andiamo    When Andiamo opened in 1987, it was the biggest thing to hit the Lincoln Center area since Luciano Pavarotti first strolled up to the footlights. This stagy northern Italian restaurant boasted a first-rate chef, an energetic staff and a stylish loft setting.   Nearly four years later, it is still going at a relatively brisk pace. The original chef, Frank Crispo, moved on last year and was replaced by his second, Gregory Godon. Mr. Godon's menu is similar in style to his predecesor's, if perhaps just a little less consistent.   Andiamo is hidden down a corridor behind a casual streetfront spot called Cafe Bel Canto, under the same ownership. At the entrance is a soaring loft with a balcony reached by an iron staircase. Track lights illuminate abstract paintings, and a papier-mache saloon pianist is frozen in mid-song on a wide platform at the back of the room. Tables are generously separated, and conversation tends to float away in this soaring space. Nonsmokers may be pleased to know that smoking is prohibited anywhere in the restaurant.   Two upbeat starters are the mussels steamed in a subtle tomato-cream broth, and the mild, beefy-tasting venison carpaccio, which is seared outside, then sliced and served with tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers and provolone. Fried calamari, served over mixed greens and deep-fried spinach, would have been fine had they not lingered backstage too long, arriving flaccid.   One dish could not be passed up, for it sounded too outlandish: prosciutto, fresh figs and peach-flavored whipped cream with mint garnish. After sampling it, my table of four voted 3 to 1 in favor. (I was in the majority.) While the whipped cream was superfluous, the combination wasn't bad at all: minimally sweet, with a hint of peaches. Agnolotti filled with lobster and porcini and served in a mushroom-cream sauce sounded like a sure winner, but the filling could have been bread crumbs for all the flavor of mushrooms and lobster that came through. The sauce was the best part. A rich, fork-tender duck confit is served on greens and beets.   Andiamo's wine list is rich in selections from virtually all over Italy. A good selection of American chardonnays is available, as is a sampling of red Bordeaux. Prices are about average. The service staff is still knowledgeable and hard-working.   Pastas are uneven. A formidable-looking mountain of penne with pesto and sliced almonds has a snowcap of deep-fried leeks. Underneath all this was hidden a fillet of salmon. The whole assembly was like one of those Pentagon test missiles that do expensive swan dives into the ocean: both are made of quality parts, but when assembled they just don't fly. Whole-wheat pappardelle came with flabby, unappetizing sweetbreads in a shiitake cream sauce, and the chef's variation on spaghetti puttanesca, with sausages and tomato, was overwhelmed by salty black and green olives. One of the best pastas sampled was angel hair with briny clams and shrimp and scallops in a good shellfish broth tinged with saffron.   Among seafood offerings, a special of red snapper over spinach with a sauce of lobster broth was delicate and flavorful. Sauteed halibut steak, another special, was perfectly cooked and accompanied by roasted corn and fresh peas. Tuna encrusted with sesame seeds, fennel seeds and crushed red pepper over couscous and a sesame oil vinaigrette was overpowering","excerpt":"the tuna was lost amid the fireworks. Lamb chops, served with white beans, tomato and green beans, are nicely done, as is a grilled sirloin steak with garlic, black peppercorns and roasted vegetables.   If you crave something sweet before the opera or symphony, chocolate layer cake on a chocolate-latticed plate with coconut ice cream should do the trick. Creme brulee with raspberries is pleasing, better than the undistinguished gelati and pallid fruit sorbets. Fried banana slices come with walnuts and Jack Daniels gelato, which is boozy but unbalanced. Instead, try the tuile cone filled with gelatin-thickened Marsala cream and ringed with fresh fruit.   While not so harmonious as it once was, Andiamo is still worth noting when you look for dinner before or after Lincoln Center performances.

Mr. Hancock delights in transformations. He toys with rhythms, turning conventional off-beat chords into a game of syncopated hide-and-seek; he reworks harmonies, adding notes until the original implications are warped. He investigates silences and subtleties; he revels in high-speed runs and splashy, gospelly chords.

Such craftsmanship calls for musical expertise and something beyond technique: remembering that the best songs are made to touch listeners, not to impress.   Ivan Lins is one of those songwriters. Mr. Lins, a major star in Brazil who has lately recorded in English, takes after Milton Nascimento both in musical specifics -- a baritone voice that rises to a yearning falsetto, a gift for ballads and a broad palette of local Brazilian rhythms -- and in the general benevolence that radiates from his songs. Like Mr. Nascimento, he concentrates on the music; for two decades, he has worked primarily with the lyricist Victor Martins.

The word means genuine, not so much in the sense of real as in the sense of pure and unadulterated. Tuscans, like Yankees, are thrifty in their approach to food (truth is, one of their favorite foods is leftovers), and they share a similar passion for beans: other Italians call them    mangiafagioli   , or bean eaters.   Rosemary and sage are the favored seasonings of Tuscan cooks, used in braising or roasting chickens, rabbits or fresh pork from the slaughtered pig. But they also use wild fennel to flavor sausages and pasta sauces, and the crumbled leaves of a wild mint called nepitella, similar to pennyroyal, with field mushrooms braised in an earthenware    tegame   . And they use that good green Tuscan extra-virgin olive oil as a flavoring or condiment, drizzling it over soups and stews, spooning it on grilled T-bone steak, a Tuscan specialty, or pouring it straight from the bottle onto crusts of toasted bread that have been rubbed with a cut clove of garlic. This is the original, the only (as far as Tuscans are concerned) true bruschetta, and it's only made during these weeks of midwinter when the oil is fresh and new from the olive mill and has that raw, peppery, back-of-the-throat kick to it that's truly addictive.

Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president and Democratic mayoral candidate, released her first television advertisement yesterday, just two weeks before the Sept. 13 primary election. The 30-second ad, ''Imagine,'' will begin appearing on cable channels tomorrow before moving to broadcast networks, and the Fields campaign said it would run through the rest of the campaign. The campaign would not provide a figure for how much television time Ms. Fields had purchased to present the ad, but her campaign manager, Chung Seto, said it was a ''competitive buy'' relative to the other candidates.    PRODUCER -- Joe Slade White    ON THE SCREEN -- Most of the ad is a montage of black-and-white photographs featuring Ms. Fields. It begins with a picture of her marching behind the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963. The next picture shows her reading to a mixed-race group of young children","excerpt":"the two after that show her talking to assorted New Yorkers. The screen then flashes the word ''Determination,'' before cutting to a picture of Ms. Fields tightly hugging a young boy. Four more still photographs follow, each featuring Ms. Fields in rapt conversation with different groups of people. The screen then flashes the word ''courage,'' before cutting to a final picture of Ms. Fields alone, above the words ''C. Virginia Fields -- Mayor.''    THE SCRIPT -- A narrator does the talking throughout, beginning, ''Who would know that for the girl, being arrested and going to jail at 17 would change her life, and ours, forever?'' The narrator then continues: ''Would it matter to have a mayor whose heart contained that much determination? Whose intelligence turned hope into action? Others talk; she listens, builds, demands. Affordable housing? Jobs? She's done it. Imagine the difference courage could make. Imagine a great mayor. C. Virginia Fields, mayor.''    ACCURACY -- Ms. Fields's record in the area of both jobs and housing is thin, but borough presidents do not, as a rule, enjoy much power to translate ideas into action. As borough president, Ms. Fields steered $4 million to a program that used it as seed money for housing development, resulting in the construction of 2,000 low-cost units in Harlem. She also played a role in the rezoning of Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Upper Manhattan, which aided the development of small businesses there.    SCORECARD -- Ms. Field's ad casts biography as destiny, much as did the advertisements Mr. White produced for Gen. Wesley Clark during the 2004 Democratic presidential primary. The ad barely mentions specific achievements by Ms. Fields during her years as a City Council member and borough president, let alone specific proposals for what she would do as mayor. Instead, it emphasizes personal qualities, grounding them in her early civil rights work. How effective it is depends largely on the degree to which viewers see in Ms. Fields's youthful activism four decades ago qualities they want in a mayoral candidate today.

Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the French Open's businesslike defending champion, and Steffi Graf, a three-time champion fixated on ending her yearlong Grand Slam drought where in 1987 she claimed the first of 15 Slam crowns, once again had their way on the clay.   \\"I'm absolutely ready for it,\\" Graf said of the prospect of a rematch with the woman who took away her 1994 United States Open title the last time they tangled and has twice prevented her from defending titles here.   The duo, already in a tussle over the No. 1 ranking, today earned the right to fight to the finish at the French Open after muscling their way through two distinctly different semifinals.   Graf, who sent out for some restorative bananas midway through the third set, clawed a meandering path into her seventh final here by defeating fourth-seeded Conchita Martinez, 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3. Their 2-hour-33-minute confrontation pitted the German's powerful serve-and-forehand combination against the mixed bag of playmaking the Spaniard has used with increasing proficiency since winning her first Grand Slam title last year on unlikely territory at Wimbledon.   \\"Today, my balls were too short, and she was on top of them with her forehand, and I'm sure she has, if not the best serve on the tour, one of the best, and it's quite difficult to return it,\\" said Martinez, who converted just 5 of the 17 break points she earned against Graf's backup weapon.   While Graf had to survive some tremulous moments, Sanchez Vicario methodically ground ninth-seeded Kimiko Date, the first Japanese semifinalist here in two decades, 7-5, 6-3. Sanchez Vicario, looking none the worse for wear for her weeklong bout with a stomach virus, reached her fourth French Open final. Date was staked to a 2-0 lead in both sets but visibly wilted after Sanchez Vicario broke her in the last game of the opening set.   \\"It was not an easy match, but maybe I am much more the specialist than her on clay,\\" said Sanchez Vicario, who performed flawlessly on all six of the break chances she received. \\"But what counts, on the important points, I probably played my best.\\"   Graf's performance was far from unflawed; she committed 67 unforced errors, more than half of them backhand slices that found the net. But Graf was pleased that, when it most counted at the end, she was obviously the fitter and more ferocious contestant.   \\"I haven't been on a court for two and a half hours since last summer,\\" said Graf, who is 24-0 in 1995 and hadn't dropped a set this year until Martinez won the middle set. \\"I was real happy to go the distance, and I fought till the end. I think I won this time because I fought.\\"   Martinez's inability to persevere along the comeback trail brought her 24-match undefeated streak atop clay to a halt and also marked her first loss since hiring a new coach, Carlos Kirmayr, after her last defeat, which happened to come against Graf in March at the Delray Beach final.   \\"I think at the beginning of the match I make so many mistakes that I didn't know if I was passive or aggressive,\\" said Martinez, who slowly solved her psychology problem as the match wore on and Graf began piling up her unforced errors.   Martinez's play was hot and cold. In the opening set, she was no more present than a ghost and occasionally appeared to be nailed to her change-over chair, she was so loath to leave it. But after Graf faltered at 4-1 in the second set, Martinez took over. In the German's opinion, Martinez \\"began to dictate\\" this seesawing encounter marred by five service breaks in the first set, six in the second and just one in the third, where Martinez's loss of the eighth game left Graf poised to again serve for the match.   Martinez had broken Graf when she served for the match in the 10th game of the second set, and after forcing the tie breaker, she was the dominant player there as well. But after Graf blasted herself out of an 0-40 deficit in the seventh game of the final set, Martinez seemed to enter the preliminary stages of surrender.   It took Graf three match points to end things, but she finally cracked a slight smile when Martinez, who let out a bellow after setting up the third match point with a netted forehand, floated a backhand slice out of bounds.   Saturday's match marks the second occasion in which Graf and Sanchez Vicario will attempt to outwork, outlast and outrage each other in a French Open finale, and this is the 13th straight time they have clashed in a final. In their career rivalry, Graf holds a 24-8 overall edge, but the Spaniard has claimed three of their last four meetings.

Although self-confident to the point of arrogance, Ray nevertheless knows that he's only the second-best guitarist of his time. No. 1 by consensus and in Ray's own opinion is the Belgian-born jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, a real-life figure whose recordings with the Hot Club of Paris and with such visitors to France as Benny Carter and Coleman Hawkins made him the first foreign-born player respected as an equal by American musicians.    The mere mention of Reinhardt's name infuriates Ray, yet he can't stop himself from jabbering about ''this Gypsy guitar player from France,'' even when surrendering to the police after a high-speed chase or reminiscing about his mother's lullabies (''the sweetest music I ever heard,'' he describes them, before grudgingly adding, ''except for this Gypsy guitar player in France.'')

His biography seems filled with data -- dates (although not that of his birth), honors (including ennoblement by the Emperor Charles V), friends (including the infamous Pietro Aretino), business transactions (dealings in lumber as well as commissions for pictures), and artistic achievements -- and yet we know little of the man. Unlike Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo, Titian has left us very few words, and those few deal primarily with matters of business and were probably drafted by friends. Nor do we fully understand his art, especially not the art of his later years. And yet that art may in fact be closer to us than any other painting of the past.

There are just a few standard secret agents—and they have only one head each.True, the main one is something of a rare bird. He is a loyal British spy who has reached the exalted rank of general on Adolf Hitler's staff. In twenty-five years of devotion to duty in the army of Germany he has gained the unquestioned confidence of his few superiors. And, as a consequence, it takes some close surveillance and the doggedness of Sherlock Holmes on the part of the rascals who suspect him to smoke him out, finally.But the others are recognizable spy types. One is an old clock merchant in Berlin and the second is a beautiful female singer who falls in love with the general, of course.As for the action, it, too, is along conventional lines, with the general treading a narrow path among the pitfalls of the Hitler high Command. That it works out more or less as you would reckon and the general, being British, finally wins is a factor that keeps it from developing the excitement and surprise one might wish.Credit Jack Hawkins, however, with doing a good, forthright job as the bogus general, whose heart is always back at that little London inn. And credit the lovely Gia Scala with looking magnificent, at least, as his eventual accomplice. That's as much as you require of a female spy.

The Holocaust was one example of this, because only isolated moments of its horror could be photographed.

This is a world, they tell us, where one can be randomly mugged, raped or decapitated by falling masonry. Standard liberal responses seem to have no effect.

British Airways P.L.C. would invest $750 million to buy as much as 44 percent of the USAir Group, with veto power over any major actions.    The agreement was carefully crafted to meet the letter of a law whose spirit has come into question. Secretary of Transportation Andrew H.

Less costly and quicker from drawing board to orbit than large satellites, \\"lightsats\\" are scheduled to be launched in record numbers over the next ten years.   Lightsats typically weigh less than 500 pounds, compared with 5,000 pounds for a large satellite. Typical costs are an order of magnitude lower as well, about $20 million against $200 million. The trade-off is capability: lightsats simply cannot do as many things as large satellites can. But lightsats are gaining in capability all the time, and for many applications they offer increased flexibility and lower cost, scientists say.   In the early days of space exploration all satellites were lightsats. Sputnik 1, launched by the Soviet Union on Oct. 4, 1957, weighed 184 pounds","excerpt":"the United States' first satellite, Explorer 1, launched on Jan. 31, 1958, weighed just 10 pounds. But, given the high cost of any launching, the temptation was always to include as many functions in one satellite as possible; launch vehicles got bigger and so did satellites.   Launching small satellites with large rockets is not financially practical, unless each rocket carries several at once, which presents its own set of problems. Until the birth of the commercial space-launch industry and the development of new, smaller launch rockets, small satellite developers had only limited access to space.   \\"There's always been a latent desire to get some small things into space,\\" said Robert B. Pincus, head of the systems development office at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \\"The problem was there weren't any viable vehicles to do the job at a reasonable rate,\\" he said. \\"The successful launching of the Pegasus in April jump-started the rebirth of the small sats and the lightsats,\\" he said.   Pegasus, which was jointly developed by the Orbital Sciences Corporation of Fairfax, Va., and the Hercules Aerospace Company of Magma, Utah, is a winged rocket which is launched from an airplane. At $7 million to $8 million per launching, compared with $60 million to $70 million for a Delta rocket launching, Pegasus provides \\"a relatively low-cost vehicle to launch relatively low-cost satellites,\\" Mr. Pincus said. If Pegasus provided the means, science and industry rapidly found the motivation for putting small objects in space. Perhaps the greatest boost to the burgeoning lightsat field has come from Motorola Inc., which has proposed putting a constellation of 77 lightsats in orbit to relay telephone calls to and from mobile phone users. Motorola plans to produce the satellites for this network, dubbed Iridium, on what it calls the \\"world's first high-volume satellite production line.\\"   Most of the manufacturers of lightsats are small entrepreneurial companies, which are more geared to producing low-cost devices than are the traditional aerospace concerns. Even if these companies do not realize any revenue from Iridium, they expect it to lend their efforts new of credibility.   Iridium \\"is the first big evidence of faith in small spacecraft. It will drive the field,\\" said R. Gilbert Moore, an adjunct professor of physics at the University of Utah and program chairman of the 4th Annual Conference on Small Satellites, held late last month in Logan. \\"The small spacecraft today has enormous capabilities compared with similar size birds of 20 years ago,\\" primarily because of improvements in electronics, he said.   One drawback to small satellites is that they must typically be used in low earth orbit - about 400 miles up, compared with 22,000 for a large satellite - because their size limits the broadcast power they can carry. So unlike a large satellite that remains in place on an orbit synchronized with the earth's rotation, small satellites travel from horizon to horizon in about 10 minutes.   \\"They come and go like streetcars, and you have to track each one,\\" said Mr. Moore. \\"That's a whole lot more complex than having a bird up in geosynch where you can have one big antenna keeping track,\\" he said. But he added that the lower cost and the spreading of risk across multiple satellites compensate for the increased complexity.   Another advantage is the reduced time from design to orbit. Whereas a large satellite can take 10 to 15 years to reach completion, lightsats make the journey from initial concept to outer space in three to four years. The military likes the reduced time to space too, and, through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has been a major proponent of light satellites. DARPA officials say that the tactical use of very small satellites during ground-based conflicts in places like Panama or the Middle East, could be possible within three or four years. DARPA will launch seven 47-pound \\"microsats,\\" made by Defense Systems Inc. of McLean, Va., on the next Pegasus, scheduled for January.   \\"Our perspective is that small satellites have a role in our overall space architecture,\\" said Air Force Lt. Col. Edward D. Nicastri, the director of DARPA's Advanced Space Technology Program. \\"But we need to really get the technology moving to make that role a significant one,\\" he said.   While microprocessors and custom integrated circuits have dramatically reduced the size and power consumption of satellite components, further advances are necessary, he said. \\"I need to put a Cray in a soup can,\\" he said, referring to the most powerful of supercomputers.   In DARPA's concept, small tactical satellites could provide reconnaissance to individual commanders in the field, sending images and information via portable computers.   But the most significant boost to the small satellite business could come from Brilliant Pebbles, a proposal of the Strategic Defense Initiative which would place thousands of small satellites in orbit to act as interceptors of enemy missile fire. In addition, the Los Alamos National Laboratory is studying the use of a network of small satellites carrying sensors to verify arms control agreements.   While most small satellites have been low orbit devices, some scientists are now considering their use for planetary missions, perhaps even as delivery vehicles for \\"mini-rovers\\" to explore the surface of Mars or other planets. One NASA project will send mice into a high orbit to study long-term effects of radiation and weightlessness.   \\"It is now possible to think about doing some really intriguing science with very small projects,\\" said David Thompson, president and chief executive of Orbital Sciences. \\"Small satellites can go any place a big satellite can go.\\"   Correction:  October 14, 1990, Sunday, Late Edition - Final Technology;   The Lure of Small Satellites"},{"year":"1974","title":"LONDON, Feb. 14 (AP)&#8212","excerpt":"The United States' franchise tennis venture, World Team Tennis, received another boost today through an agreement with the International Lawn Tennis Federation.

The district judge, Harold Murphy of Rome, Ga., ruled that vestiges of racial discrimination remained in Alabama's higher education system. He ordered Alabama and its universities to devise plans to remedy those problems, and said he would retain jurisdiction over the case for 10 years to insure that the ruling was carried out.    Judge Murphy's decision could become moot, however, because the United States Supreme Court is considering a similar case in Mississippi, the first time the Court will address the desegregation issue in higher education. Repercussions in South    The Supreme Court's ruling is likely to affect not only Alabama, but also Louisiana and several other states in the South that are wrestling with the legacy of a dual higher education system, one black and one white. Historically, the black colleges have received far less money than the white ones.   The lawsuits raise complex issues about how far states should go to end the remnants of official segregation and the fate of historically black institutions, which some blacks now argue should be allowed to stay predominantly black but be given the same financing as historically white colleges.   In the Alabama case, which began in 1983, Judge Murphy found that the two historically black institutions, Alabama State University at Montgomery and Alabama A&M University at Huntsville, had been shortchanged by about $10 million each in financing for buildings and equipment. He told the state to submit a plan to remedy those deficiencies.    Judge Murphy told Auburn University, which remains predominantly white, to change admission policies that he said appeared to discriminate against blacks. But he also told Alabama State University, which is largely black, to draw up a plan to recruit more white students.    He ordered several universities to come up with plans to increase the number of black faculty members and administrators. In addition, he demanded an end to the duplication of programs at some black and white universities.    Judge Murphy said he expected progress to be made on these changes within three years, although his law clerk, Carlos Gonzalez, said the judge had imposed no quotas or specific hiring obligations. He also charged the state and the universities to come up with specific plans on some of the changes within 90 days.    \\"The court is of the opinion that the institutions and the officials of the State of Alabama are in a much better position to develop educational policy than is the court,\\" Mr. Gonzalez said.  \\"This court is not at all hesitant to make a very detailed and specific remedial decree if these parties cannot get their act together and come up with a solution.\\" No Decision on Appeal    Lawyers for defendants in the case said they had not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling by Judge Murphy, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1977.   James U. Blacksher, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, refused to comment on the ruling.   Joe Whatley, the lawyer who represents Alabama A&M University, one of the historically black universities, said: \\"The judge didn't go as far as we had hoped, but he very definitely is requiring the state to improve these institutions. What we got here is recognition that there continue to be vestiges of discrimination and segregation. The state was never willing to come forward and provide the kind of relief that is now ordered by Judge Murphy.\\"   Although the decision appears sweeping, several lawyers for the defendants appeared to minimize its potential effects. In fact, they said Judge Murphy was requiring changes that were already under way.    \\"The things the court wants us to do are in general the things we've been wanting to do,\\" said Rob Hunter, the lawyer for several of the state defendants, including Gov. Guy Hunt, a Republican, and the Alabama Commission on Higher Education. \\"By no means is this a sweeping upheaval.\\"   Mr. Hunter said the commission had unsuccessfully asked the State Legislature for even more money for the two historically black colleges than Judge Murphy had estimated that they needed.   \\"Today, the schools in Alabama are treated without regard to their racial heritage or racial composition,\\" he said. \\"The majority of black students in Alabama attend schools other than the historically black institutions.\\" Governor Is Pleased    Sixty percent of black students in Alabama attend predominantly white institutions. But some universities remain racially skewed","excerpt":"the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa is 9 percent black and Auburn University is 4 percent black. Alabama State University at Montgomery and Alabama A&M University at Huntsville are predominantly black.   In a statement issued by his office yesterday, Governor Hunt said, \\"We are pleased the court found no current violations of law by the Governor, the Legislature, the Alabama Commission on Higher Education, or any of the state defendants.\\" Governor Hunt said he would await the Supreme Court decision.    Judge Murphy's ruling came after a six-month trial and years of legal maneuvering. The Federal Government originally filed suit in 1983. A Federal judge, U. W. Clemon, ruled in 1985 that Alabama's higher education system remained segregated, but his ruling was reversed by a Federal appeals court in 1987 on the ground that Judge Clemon should not have presided over the case because as a member of the State Senate he had helped to determine the makeup of the historically black colleges' boards of trustees.
