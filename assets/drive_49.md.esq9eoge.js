One Navy cameraman was killed in filming the action, which began with deceptive ease when the troops pushed ashore without opposition. For seven days after D, or Love Day, as the Navy men called it, the fleet stood off shore pouring in shells, sending planes aloft to strafe and bomb enemy positions, and awaiting the inevitable visit of Japanese land-based planes.Then the Kamakize pilots, or suicide flyers, made their most concentrated strike of the war, heading their craft straight for the decks of our warships. On and on they come through clouds of bursting anti-aircraft shells, sometimes hitting our fighting ships and transports, but most of the enemy were sent spiraling into the sea, trailing great tongues of flame. The photographers aimed their cameras steadily and daringly and as a result the most furious of air-sea duels has been preserved for posterity in all its frightful savagery.As the voice of the commentator remarks, \\"it was a maniacal, all-out effort to smash our sea power, isolate our troops on Okinawa. It was desperation. . . . It was suicide. But it would be the pattern from now on to the very finish . . . a struggle between men who want to die, and men who fight to live.\\" When the score was totaled, our Navy gunners and pilots had chalked up as destroyed \\"4,232 Japanese planes.\\"The cameramen also were alert to photograph the damage sustained by our ships, and there are two very remarkable shots that make one's heart leap. One is that of a fighter coming in for a landing on an unidentified flat top. As the plane's wheels touch the flight deck, a rocket bomb breaks loose from its moorings and goes snaking down the runway, then passes harmlessly over the side into the sea. Another startling picture is that of a plane which suddenly bursts into flame on the flight deck.Although \\"The Fleet Came To Stay\\" is a short film, it is one of the most vivid documentaries of the war, and it is, moreover, an expert example of movie-making.

This was, after all, the lyric soprano's first full-scale solo recital since being fired by the Metropolitan Opera for \\"unprofessional\\" behavior. Moreover, her piano accompanist was the artistic director of that very institution, James Levine. And while there were elaborate displays of mutual affection and admiration onstage -- Mr. Levine applauding Ms. Battle, Ms. Battle passing a rose to Mr. Levine -- at least until the encores, much of the audience reaction seemed muted, as if listeners were no longer quite certain about Ms. Battle's superstar status. The applause that consistently interrupted the groups of songs was polite and noncommittal, although one fan's exuberance was so unqualified his cries seemed an embarrassment.    That changed by the end of the evening, though, and at least as far as vocal quality was concerned, the experience of recent months has done no harm. Ms. Battle's mellifluous sound was still intact and perhaps even more controlled and polished than it has been in recent years. She can make a song seem entirely constructed of vowels, eliding all the disruptions of consonants. The voice can slip effortlessly into the ear, leaving behind a silky afterglow. There were some signs of wear, to be sure: a few slides up to pitch, a handful of wavery intonations, a couple of edgy highs. Ms. Battle also shied away from repertory requiring too much technical display. But she can still produce one of the most sensuous sounds on the current opera circuit.

The sticking point in these skirmishes is who gets the credit and who gets the blame, but the maneuvering is so arcane that it is doubtful that the electorate ever gets the messages sent out by the combatants.   All that the voter wants to know is: Are my taxes going up and my services being cut?  The answers to these questions depend on the outcome of the bickering between the administration and the lawmakers.  Governor Kean balanced his $6.4 billion budget by proposing a tax of 5 cents on a pack of cigarettes and extending the 5 percent sales tax to cover gasoline.

Another interesting local feature of the proceedings is the fact that burlesque's beauteous alumna, Louise Hovick, succeeds in rendering a song of an implicational nature without ever letting it descend to the level of a mere take-off.Though it will not be hailed as one of the year's finer historical films and might even be said, despite the riot scenes, to suffer from a kind of timid civilian understatement, the extent of which can only be measured by those who actually lived through \\"the terror\\"‚Äîas we of the Times Square area have come to think of it‚Äî\\"Battle of Broadway\\" seems to provoke enough of those tolerant, unanalytical audience guffaws to justify its modestly budgeted existence. The studio's most solid investment, undeniably, was in the remarkable Pilt-down skull of Victor McLaglen, who carries on another of his standard and essentially fraudulent feuds d'amour‚Äîthis time with Brian Donlevy.The scarred battlefield of their encounter is the heroically proportioned Miss Hovick in one of those strapless evening gowns, but there are certain complications involving Raymond Walburn as a steel magnate who attracts Miss Hovick vastly more powerfully than either of the two rivals‚Äîboth of whom are mere open-hearth workers at the Walburn plant.

For more than a year, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating accounting practices in the company's contact-lens division. In late 1993, Bausch & Lomb, which is based in Rochester, oversupplied distributors with contact lenses and sunglasses through aggressive marketing, and it was forced to buy back much of the inventory, reduce production and cut jobs. The restatement of results will reduce revenues and earnings from contact lenses and sunglasses for 1993. Results for 1994 will be increased by a corresponding amount.

And by extension, we are reminded once again how brittle and mercurial are the fates, for equines as well as humans -- remember, Go for Wand's jockey, Randy Romero, had been thrown and lay motionless in his yellow silks on the track by the railing.    And perhaps the realization of this was the bellows in the subconscious that resulted in the sudden gasps of horror from the crowd of 51,236 spectators at Belmont Park on Saturday afternoon, a crowd that, until then, had been cheering wildly in the stands. The fall turned the possibility of triumph for Go for Wand, just seconds away, into deadly disaster.    Amid the tragedy, one shard of glory has been understandably neglected. And that is the great race run in the Breeders' Cup Distaff by Bayakoa, the 6-year-old mare who has become the grand dame of race horses, and Go for Wand, until that spectacular 3-year-old filly shattered her ankle, which cost her her life, just strides from the finish line. Go for Wand was a champion to the end","excerpt":"Bayakoa, by good fortune, remains a champion.      This race, the fifth of nine Saturday and run for a purse of $1 million, had been billed as a virtual match race between these two stellar bays. For this long, fall-cool afternoon, an afternoon filled with the running of some of the finest race horses in the world, the race between Bayakoa and Go for Wand was expected to be the most exciting contest of all. And it was.    Almost from the moment they broke from the starting gate in this mile-and-an-eighth race with five other contenders, the pair ran head to head, with Go for Wand maintaining a slight lead. And they traveled together, like a bicycle built for two all the way around the track and then into the long home stretch, until that fateful moment about 100 yards from the finish line when Go for Wand misstepped because, according to her jockey, she was trying so hard.   She tumbled, fell, rose, limped toward the finish line, and, just short of it, collapsed, never to rise again.   Romero returned to ride in the ninth and concluding race of the day, finishing sixth aboard Izvestia; Go for Wand, a leading candidate for the Horse of the Year award, was destroyed.   She was shot with a lethal injection while lying on the track; a horse with a broken leg cannot stand during healing, and thus her organs would be misplaced. To save her the lingering agony, she was humanely and immediately \\"put down,\\" as the racing euphemism goes.    The yellow-painted wood stall of Bayakoa, in barn 12 in the Belmont stable area, is located not far from barn 41, where her chief rival, Go for Wand, was kept. At around 9 o'clock on Saturday, with the morning sunlight slicing through the small barn windows and falling at the feet of Bayakoa, she was visited by Joan D'Alonzo, an examining track veterinarian.    At about the same time, a short distance down the road, Go for Wand was being checked in the exact fashion by another track doctor, Neil Clary. It is a routine followed for every horse racing there that day.    Pulling back the long lip of Bayakoa, D'Alonzo read to her assistant, holding a clipboard, the number tattooed on the inside upper lip of the horse. This is to make certain that the horse in the stall is the horse that is supposed to be there. Clary was doing the same. Sometimes, after all, even the best of us need this confirmation: haven't most of us at one time or another looked into a mirror and wondered just who it is we are?    D'Alonzo called, \\"29309.\\" Her assistant repeated the number printed on her sheet: \\"29309.\\" The numbers matched.    Then D'Alonzo slipped under the railing and felt Bayakoa's legs for any untoward bump or warmth, which might indicate inflammation. \\"O.K.,\\" she determined.    \\"Jog her a little bit,\\" she now requested of the groom, Ricardo Contreras. He took the reins and jogged Bayakoa along shed row for about 50 feet. D'Alonzo crouched to observe the movement of the legs. \\"She's sound,\\" she concluded. Clary, certainly, was doing the same.      It is always a shock to see close up how very thin are the legs of thoroughbred race horses, nearly like wires. How they can support the 1,200 or so pounds of the rest of the animal is an amazing thing, especially when they're dashing at 35 miles an hour. Sometimes they can't.    As Bayakoa was being led through the concrete tunnel to the paddock before the race, her owner, Frank Whitham, walking behind his horse and looking at her so-slender legs, said, with parental concern to his veteran trainer, Ron McAnally, \\"You checked her shoes, too, I guess.\\"    McAnally retorted, respectfully, \\"I try to cover all the bases.\\"    So, it seems, did Billy Badgett, Go for Wand's trainer. And, apparently, so did everyone else involved. But sometimes, for some of us, it is still not enough. With Legs As Slender As Wires"},{"year":"1959","title":"SO you think you have seen everything?
