Hoefler's film record of the Colorado expedition across Equatorial Africa in 1928-29, hardly meets with one's expectations, but some of the glimpses of wild, beasts, particularly the lions on the veldt, are truly remarkable. This informative and often highly exciting feature is accompanied by a Movietone lecture describing the various scenes.Mr. Hoefler fashioned his own sound apparatus for the recording of the noises made by the denizens of the jungle. The growl of the lion is heard, but it is not as effective as the action of the animal. Sometimes one hears the panting of the beasts. It is, however, the stretch with the lions that is really thrilling. Several of the beasts are beheld devouring a carcass and later a lion is seen waiting for a wart-hog to come out of its lair. A murmur arose from the spectators in the theatre yesterday afternoon, when the great beast caught the smaller animal in his jaws and lugged it off for a meal. Lions have been seen in several other African films, but never as they are here, for during one interlude Mr. Hoefler, on observing two lions approaching his camera, calls to a native to get the guns. Before the dusky individual can get to the weapons one of the lions pounces on him and it is explained, after Mr. Hoefler and Harold Austin, a Californian, have dispatched two of the lions with their pistols, that it was then too late to help the native.Another sequence shows a swarm of locusts that eat up all the foliage and leave the trees looking as bare as though Winter had suddenly come. There are a few views of African elephants and one also hears their peculiar cry. Then there is the gnu, which growls like a lion","excerpt":"white rhinoceroses, chattering monkeys, a swarm of flamingoes, a herd of giraffes and some extraordinarily interesting leaping impallas, or springboks.Mr. Hoefler devotes a good deal of footage to the Ubangi women with the plate-like lips, caused by the insertion of disks that are gradually increased in size. It is explained that the male element insists on this disfigurement of the females so that they are useless as slaves to hostile tribes.There are also a few scenes of pygmies, whose favor is won by a bag or two of salt, which these small people of the Ituri forest consume as though it were sugar.This explorer shows that he has a keen eye for photographic effects as well as for dramatic clashes with wild animals. Mr. Hoefler and Mr. Austin are heard conversing while they are presumed to be in the wilds of Africa.While in Africa Mr. Hoefler wrote three articles on the expedition for the Sunday magazine section of THE NEW YORK TIMES. He said the other day that all the sounds of animals in the film were authentic, having been recorded as the camera was turned.This \\"Africa Speaks\\" is the most thrilling of travel pictures that have come to the screen.

For most black men and women, in fact, the ''war'' was a virtual rout. The other side owned the land and controlled the law, the police, the courts, the government and the press. Those were formidable odds, and whites made the most of them. Although black voters posed no threat to white supremacy, whites insisted on almost total disfranchisement.

In those days I regularly carried chapters and a nicely sharpened pencil around with me. I sat with pencil and typescript, scratching out awkward phrases and trying out new ones.   Next to me sat a white man of about 35, whose absorption in my work increased steadily. He watched me intently - kindly - for several moments. ''Is that your dissertation?'' I said yes, it was.

The state, which now has more than $3 billion in bonds outstanding, can afford to issue only an additional $300 million, said Jayne Rebovich, a spokeswoman for the Governor.

In the 1840's, Whitman wrote ecstatically of the city's \\"numberless crowded streets\\" and the \\"immigrants arriving, fifteen or twenty thousand a week\\" and \\"the teeming nation of nations\\" taking shape before his eyes. Whitman's vision finds full flower in Brooklyn today with its vast tracts of Arabs, Asians and especially Caribbean immigrants whose accents, colors and flavorings permeate every cranny of the bard's old home.   Whitman would no doubt be pleased that blunt-talking Brooklyn is deep in poets today. For years it has even had its own poet laureate -- a job that fell vacant last month with the death of the 81-year-old novelist and playwright Norman Rosten, the first and only poet to hold the grand but meaningless title. The laureate's job comes with no formal duties -- and no salary. Yet as The Times's Joe Sexton pointed out on Sunday, the competition to succeed Mr. Rosten is fierce. Potential successors include an 80-year-old biologist in Sheepshead Bay, a former subway poet who says he would come out of retirement to accept the laureate title, and a middle-aged man who claims to be the official poet laureate of Bedford-Stuyvesant.

Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey gave herself a chance to be the pathfinder in her party's trek toward lower taxes and leaner government with more local control in statehouses.    Last week, Mrs. Whitman showed she knew the way when she rolled over the objections of some of her own party's leaders to enact the second half of her 30 percent income tax cut a year ahead of schedule. The legislature, which is in Republican hands, also passed her $16 billion budget for the coming year, including a plan to put dozens of state operations in the hands of private contractors, at the cost of 2,900 public jobs.    The Governor's easy budget victory did nothing to diminish her reputation as a contender for the national ticket next year. Even complaints from statehouse Democrats that she is starving the state of services to fatten her own national reputation have failed to dampen New Jerseyans' affection for her.    But Mrs. Whitman must wonder if her national destiny will find her before the weaknesses in her budget do. Her tax cut needs a strong economy and the indicators are faltering. And even Republicans fear that her cuts may only raise property taxes. But by then she could be in Washington.

That's not how it was supposed  to be, but creating that sort of absurd situation is exactly the goal of the terrorists.         Why? Precisely because the peace process up to now had won the support of both the Israeli and Palestinian silent majorities and precisely because it was  being successfully implemented on the ground. Extremists on both sides understood that if they did not act now and decisively to halt this trend, the peace process was going to transform relations between Israelis and Arabs in such a fundamental way that it would make their radical visions impossible to ever be realized. But the extremists also understood that to stop the process, after it was so far along, they could not just engage in garden-variety terrorism -- they had to go nuclear. They had to do things so unspeakable that it would paralyze everyone. They had to murder the Israeli Prime Minister. They  had to set off a series of suicide bombs. Since they could not persuade the silent majorities to reject peace, their only hope was to frighten them out of it by making it appear that the peace process was the source of their troubles,  not the solution to them, by making it appear that peace equals death.

It seems, some commentators feel, that had a more \\"representative\\" cross-section of the country been serving in our armed forces, certain Washington elites would be less committed to military intervention in the region. Presumably, the solution lay in universal military service.   Such an argument strikes me as naive at the least. Does anyone really believe that if America's privileged youth (which apparently includes any middle-class kid who goes straight into college, rather than turn to the military for vocational training or tuition assistance) were to be found in large numbers throughout the United States military, that they would be toting rifles, mortars and machine guns through the Saudi Arabian sand dunes? Or would these positions not be filled with the same young people who fill them now?   With the possible exception of the military of 1941-45, the United States armed forces have traditionally relied on the sons (and now daughters) of its working class and underprivileged to do its fighting and dying. Universal service would do nothing to change this, but it would give the President a pool of cannon fodder any time our leaders misperceive and miscalculate the intentions of international gangsters, as they did these last 10 years with Saddam Hussein and Iraq.

Where this film is illogical it is partly saved by amusing quips and incidents and while the dénouement is not actually a surprise, it is worked in a way that keeps one guessing.James Cruse is responsible for this picture, which is circulated by Tiffany Productions. Considering the material at hand his direction is fairly good. Mr. Tracy's rôle, that of Eddie, is often reminiscent of his interpretation of the hoofer in the play \\"Broadway.\\" Eddie is thoroughly satisfied with both his ability and his personality. According to him he is irresistible and his great success in life is merely delayed.Betty Compson impersonates the vacillating Mahyna, a Russian immigrant","excerpt":"who in the opening of the picture is the wife of Boris, a hopeful book-seller and writer. Mahyna nags her husband because he is slothful, but apparently he does not mind. They have a boarder named Dave, played by Alan Hale, who is infatuated with Mahyna. Just before the close of the first sequence, this young woman decides to elope with Eddie, who paints a glowing picture of their future. The second sequence begins with Mahyna nagging and the camera swings along and one expects to see Eddie, but instead of the saxophonist one perceives Dave. Eddie, it seems, has not kept his rendezvous with Mahyna and she has divorced her husband and become Dave's wife. Boris, however, is not out of the picture, for he has taken Dave's place as the boarder.When Boris becomes affluent through the sale of his book, Mahyna feels somewhat regretful that she chose to be married to Dave, who runs a gambling place. Then Eddie pops up again and Mahyna is as gullible as ever. There are further surprises and even toward the end, when Eddie and Mahyna are in the Pennsylvania Station ready to take chances together, the saxophonist again changes his mind. He buys the tickets and takes another girl with him, leaving Mahyna wondering why he does not return.What with a murder in Dave's gambling establishment, Boris trying to get his former wife to run away with him and other incidents, it cannot be said that Mahyna leads a humdrum existence. Of course, as one might surmise, she is fortunate enough in the end in remarrying Boris, and Eddie finds that his personality counts for nothing.Betty Compson, talking in broken English, does satisfactorily. Alan Hale is acceptable as the gambling Dave and Gaston Glass gives a creditable performance as Boris. But these players are all put in the shade by Mr. Tracy's knowledgeful acting. The way he uses his hands while talking is remarkable, for there is nothing strained in his gesticulations.At one of the early showings of this film on Saturday the voices were far from clear and this defect in the reproduction of the sound was accentuated by the foreign accents assumed by Miss Compson and Gaston Glass.

Although this carefully directed picture lacks the spontaneity and drama of the original, there is throughout its length, an evident desire to do well by the author. The Mrs. Craig of the film is a good carbon copy of the Mrs. Craig of the stage and the same applies to Walter Craig, the husband, and to some of the other characters.William C. De Mille, director of this subject, had no easy task in turning Mr. Kelly's play into a picture, for no matter how well it was done it was bound to suffer by comparison. Yet, although he repeats a little too much on the actions to register Mrs. Craig's punctiliousness and selfishness, Mr. De Mille has clicited from both Irene Rich and Warner Baxter competent portrayals in their respective rôles of Mrs. Craig and her husband. In fact, Miss Rich, looks extraordinarily attractive and so far as her acting is concerned it is comparable with her best work. Mr. Baxter makes an understanding Walter Craig, even if he does appear to be very fond of a polka-dot necktie.The dramatic values in this production, do not stir one as they did in the play. When Walter Craig smashes one of his wife's favorite vases, it is interesting but not gripping. Quite a number of persons in the audience yesterday afternoon laughed with glee, so glad were they that this husband was finally rebelling against the tyrany of a selfish wife.In the picture it seems strange that no servant saw Mr. Craig when he went to play bridge with his friend Passmore. The police are therefore as in the play, searching for the Other Man after Passmore shoots his wife and himself. Mr. Dc Mille in his eagerness to show prison bars has Craig locked, in a cell for several hours, when it is to be presumed that he was detained merely as a witness.Mrs. Craig's. curiosity about the telephone number and the trouble her lies cause are admirably brought out. And, before it is forgotten, Mr. De Mille ought to be highly commended for giving the picture the same ending as the play.Lilyan Tashman","excerpt":"who is an adept in her portraits of vampires and skittish wives, is capital as Mrs. Passmore, who carries in her bag the key to some mysterious apartment.

That is, unless, as an old hand at the game, you proceed immediately to suspect the member of the cast whose innocence seems entirely beyond question.To proceed to the delicate business of a summary which will not betray the Rialto's management, this is the violent story of a scientist who has pleaded insanity in order to escape a conviction for a series of murders which he did not commit. Fleeing from the mad-house in one of those harrowing storms which Hollywood manages so effectively, he turns up at his old sanatorium and begins a game of hide-and-seek with a reporter, a rare collection of lunatics, a pair of crooks who are hiding out and a couple of doctors. It gets to be fairly obvious after a while that Dr. Redmayne, the supposed lunatic, is not the man who is butchering the cast at the rate of one every six or seven minutes, and the suspects turn into corpses so rapidly near the end that the old smarties in the audience can make some good guesses.It happens that during its manufacture several loopholes were left in the theoretically solid structure of \\"The Return of the Terror,\\" thereby providing the amateur Hawkshaws with the material for a good post-mortem. Why, for instance, did the killer enter the bed-room of Olga, the heroine, and why didn't Olga, who screamed when she saw his face, expose him to the police? And, by the way, how did he manage the lightning change which made it possible for him to appear innocently at the door in a dressing gown about four seconds later?\\"The Return of the Terror\\" has been managed with the usual Hollywood skill in the physical properties, but its structure has a carpentered look. As the suspicious reporter, Frank McHugh creates a few laughs, but the writing is strictly routine and the necessary humor is largely absent. Robert Emmett O'Connor is excellent as a hard-boiled detective, and the other principals, John Halliday, Mary Astor, Lyle Talbot and Robert Barrat, are entirely satisfactory.

But as the chairman of Chanel, Alain Wertheimer is the man who controls the purse strings of perhaps the most successful French fashion house today. It is Wertheimer who allows the lavish expenditures that keep the designer Karl Lagerfeld satisfied and surrounded by the best of everything -- from fabrics to staff to sybaritic perks.   Wertheimer is one of an elite few, tough but astute Parisian businessmen who back the best of French fashion. Like Pierre Berge, chairman of Yves Saint Laurent, and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the company that owns the couture houses of Christian Dior, Christian Lacroix and Hubert de Givenchy, Wertheimer understands that true talent must be nourished in a secure but opulent cocoon.

Without smooth, efficient travel, the performance of business is frustrated, something no one can afford in today's economic climate.   That deregulation leaves \\"far fewer direct flights\\" has robbed the business traveler of the most precious commodity of all: time. Nonstop service on most major routes has become monopolistic or at best controlled by two air carriers. The business traveler has fewer choices, because economy dictates using the fastest route.    Measuring saving simply in terms of fares paid lacks a deeper grasp of what business travel is about: getting from point A to point B in the most expedient manner possible. To use your example of Toledo, there no longer is nonstop service to that city from New York, which immediately results in a cost of approximately two hours in each direction, much more if the connection is missed. True, there are now 14 daily connections to Toledo, more than ever before. However, they are all far slower","excerpt":"who needs more choices among inferior products? Since time is money, it should be accounted for in the economists' spreadsheet calculations.   Yes, the business traveler is \\"least sensitive\\" to high fares: business needs are more urgent and less flexible than leisure plans. However, business travel demand has been incorrectly perceived by the airlines to be inelastic. The freewheeling 1980's were an occasion for the carriers to raise unrestricted fares, effectively coercing the business traveler to subsidize the infrequent flier's deeply discounted pleasure trips. The reality of the 90's, however -- higher prices as a result of virtual route monopolies and fewer time-effective options -- will teach the airlines to keep reason in mind when setting prices, both high and low.   On another note, an airline's only means to enforce the use of a single reservation system on a travel agency is price: any agency can elect to get around this by paying the price. Not to pay this price is a false economy. The use of a sole system can have disastrous effects for a traveler's booking, ranging from inaccurate pricing to missing reservations. That is why our agency has for years actively employed the use of several major reservation systems in our daily operation. MICHAEL L.

Government mints have placed increasing emphasis on colorful, elaborate packages for their special coins and coin sets. However, many hobbyists have come to the conclusion that much of this packaging is superfluous and simply serves as camouflage for overly inflated prices.\\n\\n This feeling gave rise to widespread grumbling late last year when the United States Mint introduced a so-called ''prestige'' proof set. The set included proof examples of six 1983 U.S. coins: the five regular-issue coins, ranging from the cent through the half dollar, plus the 1983 Olympic silver dollar. What made the set ''prestigious,'' at least in the eyes of the Mint, was its fancy packaging - it came in a leather case, complete with a snap-on strap.\\n\\nThe grumbling began when hobbyists heard the price. Even though the component coins were available separately for a combined total of only $43 ($32 for the silver dollar plus $11 for the regular five-coin proof set), the Mint was charging $59 for the prestige set. Inquiries determined that the Mint was paying a supplier $5.44 each for the leather cases - so even with that expense factored in the price of the set included a surcharge of more than $10 for which there was no explanation.

But certainly the fitful arrangements for living together that the couple make, and their ultimate solution of their housing problem by going to live and teach in a village school, suggest that their lives are almost as hapless as those of the lovers in Mr. Hitchcock's morbid film.Actually, the distinction of this picture is its strong naturalistic style and the manner in which Mr. Lazic has placed a background of working-class life behind the foreground fumblings of his lovers, who can never withdraw too far from the aspects of toil. The old, weary faces of factory workers and knobby bodies wracked by coughs are frequently exposed by Mr. Lazic as an evident reminder that age and physical and emotional exhaustion are the epilogue to the feverish years. And he counterpoints this pessimism with one lyrical, wistful sequence, which tells of a visit of the couple to see the parents of the young man on their farm.Mr. Lazic has a sensitive skill with visuals. He develops impressive images, even in a sordid, tedious sequence showing the windup of a drinking orgy in a Belgrade basement apartment. And he gets calm, evocative performances from Bekim Fehmiu as the man and Ana Matic as the young woman, who does unbend, however, when she makes love.\\"The Feverish Years\\" tells us nothing about a stage in life that hasn't been told many times. It simply tells us how it is in Yugoslavia, where the far-off hills are beautiful and soft but not too green.'Yesterday Girl'WATCHING the plight of \\"Yesterday Girl,\\" a poor, buffeted young derelict in West Germany, some viewers may wistfully hark back to the teary but untangled sagas of Sylvia Sidney in Hollywood during the Depression years. Miss Sidney's cases, at least, were stated with soggy succinctness.The hard-luck drama that unfolded last night at the New York Film Festival, the first feature directed by the German novelist Alexander Kluge, is so hell-bent on stylistic effects and so sauvely stingy in siphoning simple case-history facts that we learn little and subsequently care less about the heroine. A pity, too, for the hapless girl peering from the circuitous labyrinth of film footage is the director's sister, Alexandra. She even has Miss Sidney's stricken eyes and quivering under-lip. That much is obvious.It seems—repeat, seems—that the girl has fled from East Germany and been arrested for shoplifting in the West. She serves a jail sentence, then starts a descent on the fringes of society in a succession of odd jobs, including a brief go at prostitution. Bruised by bureaucracy, fate and at least one lover who discards her, the girl slinks off into the night, clutching a suitcase, and has a baby at a state hospital.Mr. Kluge's picture, with its down-and-out protagonist, is according to advance publicity, an ironic commentary on the West German's economic well-being. How? We see little evidence of prosperity in Miss Kluge's mouse-hole itinerary. Most of the people who speed her on her descent are glacial, urban stereotypes. And from what little is revealed about the heroine's true character, she appears to be a listless girl who would have a tough time mastering a job anywhere.Whatever \\"Yesterday Girl\\" symbolizes, Mr. Kluge applies his camera like a clouded microscope, side-stepping simple compassion for bland, clinical detachment. A stethoscope, applied just once, would have conveyed much more.

American History"},{"year":"1990","title":"FIRST CAME CHARLES FREDERICK WORTH. He set the mode from Paris in the last century. Paul Poiret took the mantle until Coco Chanel dismantled him with her revolutionary concepts. Christian Dior struck with his structured New Look, only to be superseded with Cristobal Balenciaga's baglike chemises. Andre Courreges and Pierre Cardin shook things up with their spacey silhouettes, and blue jeans and street looks that slipped in. Then, in the late 1960's, Yves Saint Laurent put it all together and established fashion standards for modern career-oriented women that still make sense today.   The Saint Laurent philosophy remains, and he still influences fashion with his couture collections. But his dominance has diminished. In the 1980's Azzedine Alaia and Emanuel Ungaro played up the well-toned body beautiful, punching their imprints on international style. They made sexy clothes chic. And Christian Lacroix popped up with his witty, elegant poufs that answered the apparent need in the latter part of the decade for fantasy. But now that the 1990's are rolling, it's clear that the fashion crowns sit on different heads.   Today it is Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld, with his designs for the House of Chanel, that rule the fashion roost. Whatever directions these men materialize is the stuff of international style legend.   Everything that comes out of the House of Chanel bearing Lagerfeld's imprint seems to sell immediately and is copied outright or inspires a rash of similar looks. Taking the premises of men's tailoring then sweeping the stiffness out, Giorgio Armani has created a mode of dressing for women that is at once elegant yet casual, restrained but subtly erotic. Armani has tapped -- in a high-style way -- a central vein of dressing for today's woman's world, a world of work, travel, constant motion and never enough time. Not surprisingly, he too is endlessly emulated, if not patently knocked off.   It is not surprising that two designers' philosophies and products dominate the international scene now. Nothing else in life is simply black or white, so why should we expect fashion to be? Both operating at the hautest of design levels, Lagerfeld's Chanels supply the decorative shapes and touches to fashion, while Armani's viewpoint satisfies the conservative, functional requirements. The only similarity the men share is that both work off a preset base: Armani, that of men's traditional tailoring, and Lagerfeld, the fashion molds and mode first established by Coco Chanel.   All style reigns come to a close at some time, as women's needs and desires shift. However, Armani and Lagerfeld are it for the foreseeable future. But is Claude Montana's turn coming, as he begins to combine his sharp-edged images with softer, prettier nuances? Will Lacroix, with his wit and passionately romantic vision, recoup with another notion as potent as his pouf? And, to take the longest shot of all, will Isaac Mizrahi, with his strong sense of originality and uniquely American point of view, eventually become the first from this country to wear the world crown? Wait and see. Fashion","excerpt":"WHO RULES THE ROOST?"},{"year":"1962","title":"Viscount Stansgate opposes it, sees council just as powerless to act as UN, lr THE WORLD","excerpt":"Who Runs Algeria?

Last year, an independent audit by the General Accounting Office confirmed this, noting a decrease in staff from 1,098 in 1980 to 895 in 1984.

Miss Christie, later to become Dame Agatha, wrote many, many books, most of them immensely popular and famous for their unexpected endings.   These prompted dozens of imitators, some almost as successful and prolific as Dame Agatha, and eventually inspired Edmund Wilson's classic essay, ''Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?''   As someone who has as much difficulty plowing through the Christie prose as through Noam Chomsky's, I suppose I agree with Mr. Wilson, but only up to the point at which the Christie whodunit becomes a movie. Then I'm likely to get hooked, and stay hooked, right up to the obligatory scene in which everyone is called into the drawing room to hear several thousand words of explanations that nearly always leave me unenlightened. It makes no difference how genteel the circumstances, how foolish the characters or how preposterous the plotting, I continue to watch. When one reads a Christie, one has to work.

It is a film that possesses the virtue of a novel idea, but even discounting the fantastic notion of the theme, it is frightfully artificial and sometimes extraordinarily silly. Aside from the actual unfurling of the story, the backgrounds do not strike one as being very far from a motion-picture studio.The first episodes promise something really engrossing, but in the end there is a sort of mixture of a Wild Man of Borneo story and a \\"Tarzan of the Apes.\\" In fact with all \\"Tarzan's\\" wild stretches, it was far more plausible than this present tale.Paul Wagener, the celebrated German actor, figures as Captain Ramper, an aviator who wings his way to the Arctic regions. The machine is forced down, but neither Ramper nor his mechanician, Ipling, is hurt. Through some good luck they discover stores left there by an American exploring party. Ramper struggles on in the frozen north, but Ipling finally shoots himself. It is after Ramper has been in the untrodden wilds for fifteen years that he is discovered by men from a whaling vessel. They look upon him as a Polar ape. His hair has grown over most of his physiognomy and his body is covered like that of a Polar bear. Really, this covering does not look like anything but a fur coat. However, there you are, and there the whaler's men are.This terrifically powerful \\"beast\\" every now and again sends his wild call through the stillness of the Arctic.Ramper is brought back aboard the vessel in a cage, and when a German port is reached, the sailor responsible for finding and capturing the strange specimen decides to sell his prize to a side-show owner, who has lost his performing ape. The victim of the years in the northern wastes is brutally treated by the showman, but a girl named Tony coaxes the supposed animal, and it expresses its gratitude by touching Tony's hair with its peculiar claws.A busy surgeon, who apparently never makes a mistake, appears on the scene. It is through an operation performed by him that Ramper regains his speech. He awakens in a hospital to discover that he really looks human.The producers have fiddled about for a love theme and old Captain Ramper decides to help along the happy ending by giving the young couple the $50,000 sent to him by sympathizers.A good deal of imagination has gone into a sequence concerned with Captain Ramper's impressions of a modern metropolis. He is disgusted with the mad existence and the more he sees of the wild present day existence the more he wishes to return to his Polar retreat.One gets but a vague notion of the man's life in the Polar wastes and the glimpses in the sideshow are not always agreeable and sometimes they are so strained that they are ridiculous.Mr. Wagener's acting is probably good, but much of the time one can only see his eyes. Mary Johnson supplies the childish beauty, but that's about all.This picture was directed by Max Reichmann from a story by Curt J. Braun.The stage features include the Sixteen Roxyettes, dancers, and \\"Peer Gynt Suite.\\" The Movietone gives part of President Coolidge's Gettysburg address.

Bicycles are very much a part of the Italian scene, especially in the less mountainous parts of the central and northern regions.   This strong commitment to the bicycle fosters a lively industry in Italy. And with the country's tradition of fine design and workmanship, it means that Italian bicycles are among the best in the world. In a good many American bike shops, the top-of-the-line model on display in the window is likely to be Italian. Even if the frame is different, the parts will probably be Campignolo, an Italian label recognized around the world.

The Ramen Museum.  The Ramen Hakubutsukan is an amazing, amusing place that combines mercantile kitsch (a noodle souvenir shop and video games about noodles, for example), historic archives (including the first box of instant Japanese noodles marketed) and eight noodle restaurants -- each serving a different regional version of ramen -- under one roof. The casual eateries are incorporated into a two-story, basement-level re-creation of an urban 1950's street scene.
