Medical.\\" And no wonder. Andy's new flat is the extravagantly Gothic apartment long ago occupied by John Barrymore, and even in 1991 it remains a suitably regal throne room for any show-business prince, past, present or still aspiring. Since Andy (Evan Handler) is about to assume Barrymore's most celebrated Shakespearean role in a Joseph Papp production in Central Park, what is to stand in the way of his complete artistic fulfillment? Only one thing. Much as Andy loves his apartment, loves the theater and loves stardom, he hates Hamlet.    \\"I Hate Hamlet,\\" the new comedy by Paul Rudnick at the Walter Kerr Theater, is the unapologetically silly and at times hilarious tale of how Andy rises above his fear and loathing of the role people ritualistically refer to as \\"the greatest in the English-speaking world.\\" To do so, he must seek the help of Barrymore himself, who comes back from the grave to give his young would-be successor instructions in Shakespearean acting, not to mention life and love. Don't ask how and why Barrymore rises from the dead -- Mr. Rudnick's seance takes far too long as it is -- but do be cheered by the news that the ghost is played by Nicol Williamson. A first-class Hamlet in his own right once upon a time, and on occasion as flamboyant an offstage figure as Barrymore was, Mr. Williamson offers a riotous incarnation of a legendary actor, lecher and lush (not necessarily in that order) whom even death has failed to slow down.

And for those intrigued by the way everyday objects reflect the society that produces them, a lively and illuminating show at the Margaret Melville Blackwell History Museum in Stony Brook tackles the subject of ethnic stereotyping in children's toys.   Sandwiched between these exhibitions, geographically, are a brief look at recent abstract art based on nature at the Heckscher Museum in Huntington, a survey of contemporary art by American Indians in Stony Brook, and a small show of Hans Namuth's photographs of Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, which may be seen at the site where the pictures were taken on a summer's day 41 years ago: the Pollock-Krasner House in East Hampton. Roslyn    Although it is sequestered in a hallway at the Nassau County Museum, \\"Mark Rothko: The Spirit of Myth\\" is among the strongest shows this weekend, and one of the most extensive displays of early Rothko seen in the New York City area in a while. All 24 works have been lent by the National Gallery of Art from a large gift given to it by the Rothko Foundation in 1986.   The show's title is well chosen, because Rothko often looked for inspiration in the classical past. Despite sideways glances at Picasso and de Chirico, his gaze is nearly direct in paintings like an untitled work from 1941 in which a Greek head acquires multiple profiles and a friezelike body. Yet even in an urban scene like \\"Subway,\\" from the artist's 1930's brush with Social Realism, tall narrow figures and repeating pillars convey a gravity and grace that alternately evoke a Greek play and a modern ballet inspired by one.   A sense of unfolding drama is also prominent in the ethereal Surrealist images from the late 1940's that preceded Rothko's final abstract style. These canvases, the most plentiful in the exhibition, are dominated by translucent linear forms that bob and pirouette like totemic jellyfish before aqueous bands of color.   In the end, even the somewhat claustrophobic installation is effective, encouraging close encounters with the extraordinary sorbet tones of Rothko's early period and his gentle yet free-wheeling way with the paintbrush (and at times its handle). His palette brings to mind a worldly mix of precedents -- the Italian quattrocento, Balthus and Milton Avery -- and underscores that from start to finish he was foremost a consummate and inventive colorist. A final gallery displaying a few of the artist's classic 50's and 60's abstractions, in which his dramas become purely chromatic, gives this mini-retrospective an expansive finale.   \\"American Narrative Painting and Sculpture,\\" the exhibition that receives the majority of the gallery space at the Nassau County Museum, is substantially lighter fare. The nearly 45 paintings and sculptures are all from the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Their primary effect is to reacquaint one with the museum's always startling devotion to mediocre artists -- often academic realists -- whose efforts hardly merit the attention of such a major art institution.   Mark Tansey's wry, history-tinted brand of photo-realism makes a credible case for a realist revival, but it receives no backup here. Instead, the strongest figurative works are by artists who mix liberal amounts of the naive or primitive in their styles: Dona Nelson, Alison Saar, Rafael Ferrer, Red Grooms and Roger Brown. The inclusion of abstract works by Carol Hepper, Melissa Meyer, Mel Kendrick, Bill Jensen, Kevin Larmon and Roberto Juarez expands the show's premise so completely that any 1980's artist could have been in it, provided his work had been acquired by the Metropolitan, of course. But their presence makes the important point that 80's abstraction, in both its hints of imagery and its formal complexity, was full of narrative implications. Southampton    The 1980's were not short on either romance or irony, so the list of candidates for an exhibition titled \\"Romance and Irony in Recent American Art\\" is long. But Julian Schnabel, to cite one of the better exemplars of the period's romanticism, is not in this exhibition at the Parrish Museum of Art in Southampton, nor are Jeff Koons and sundry other ironists, including those sometimes masters of nostalgia, the collaborative team of David McDermott and Peter McGough. Instead, a consistent realist air and a preponderance of dark or grisaille surfaces prevail, nearly to the point of monotony. A more accurate title might have been \\"Romance and Irony in Recent American Landscape Painting and Photography.\\"   Basically, this exhibition taps into one of the more conservative strains in the smorgasbord of 80's art: the revival of Romantic landscape painting, replete with ultra-finicky surfaces. Joan Nelson, April Gornik and Mark Innerst are here, for example. But it also features this tendency's opposite number: a variety of deadpan photographic and photo-based imagery by Barbara Ess, Oliver Wasow, Troy Brauntuch, Edward Ruscha and, once more, Mr. Tansey. (Ms. Ess's photographs, made with a primitive pinhole camera, have a haphazard, almost anarchic energy that is especially refreshing in this rather fastidious gathering.) The show's strength lies in the way it makes one appreciate the way some artists have braided the romantic and the ironic together into seamless ambiguities.   But what lies between these extremes is genuinely third-rate: the sinister scenes of John Hull, the nostalgic Victoriana of Thomas Woodruff, the dimly lighted figures of Willi Lenski and much else. History, art history that is, reared its ferocious head in the 80's, and many young artists seem to have been struck blind, or simply unoriginal, by the sight. Huntington    Meanwhile, a little farther west once more, the Heckscher Museum is taking stock of another 1980's development, the influence of natural, or biomorphic, form on abstract art. This small exhibition of five painters and three sculptors, titled \\"Vital Forces: Nature in Contemporary Abstraction,\\" is personable, but also largely generic. The evocations of precedent in Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, Arshile Gorky and William Baziotes made by the show's curator, Anna C. Noll, in a brochure, seem overly familiar.   The 80's artists who helped lend this tendency credibility, among them Carroll Dunham, Terry Winters and Bill Jensen, are absent, although their presence is often felt. Gregory Amenoff has lately turned to abstractions that have some of Mr. Jensen's bristling forms, as do the more condensed, naturalistic abstractions of Ellen Wiener","excerpt":"Willy Heeks's clotted shapes and tangled drips of paint seem to fuse some of the formal strategies of Mr. Winters and Mr. Dunham.   Nonetheless, every artist here is guided by a convincing desire to blend the intimations of nature with the material possibilities of painting, drawing or sculpture; there's a sense of physical experiment throughout. Especially in an untitled 1988 work, Michael Tetherow's languid pourings of paint on unprimed canvas have an ethereal liquidity that is both delicately controlled and as random as a pond's surface. Elisa D'Arrigo's large, funnel-like floor sculpture, \\"Voice,\\" simultaneously evokes a horn, a shell and a woven basket, with its pinkish-white plaster interior being its most impressive characteristic. Peter Brown, Petah Coyne, Michael Kessler and Janis Provisor are also represented in the exhibition. Stony Brook    Two different but equally intriguing, equally imperfect exhibitions at the five-museum grouping known as the Museums at Stony Brook manifest the current art-world concern -- some might say obsession -- with multi-culturalism. \\"Our Land/Ourselves: American Indian Contemporary Artists\\" was organized by Jaune Quick-to-See-Smith, herself an artist, for the University Art Gallery at the State University at Albany, and will travel to eight more stops, mostly other museums within the SUNY system, during the next two years.   The show includes 2 or 3 works on paper by 30 artists from many American Indian tribal groups. All are clearly versed in contemporary art; their biographies refer to bachelor's and master's degrees acquired at art schools around the country. On the wall, the vocabularies of Conceptual art, various forms of abstraction and figuration and recent photographic work speak for themselves.   Many of the artists deal with their Indian heritage, some overtly, others in ways that are harder to read and at times invisible, but the quality of the work does not divide along these lines. Ernie Pepion's touching pastel drawing \\"Artist and Assistants\\" is a self-portrait in which the artist sits outdoors in a wheelchair making a painting using a buffalo design while a buffalo, a bird and a dog look on. G. Peter Jemison's watercolor \\"All Indians Don't Live West of the Mississippi\\" is a political cartoon whose real power derives from the blunt way the artist lays on paint and from his sense of color.   At the same time, the intense little black-and-white monoprints of P. Y. Minthorn, which would have looked just fine in the \\"Vital Forces\\" exhibition at the Heckscher, could have been made by any artist who feels connected to nature. The scratched lines, trackings and suggestions of crosses that are also bodies take on a somewhat different meaning when the artist's ethnic background is known, but it is not a significant difference. The same goes for the colorful abstract patterns of Conrad G. House's \\"Paseo del Norte\\" and the starlike tracery of Harry Fonseca's mixed-media drawing \\"Nocturne.\\" The diversity of the art in this exhibition, the sense of different voices saying different things, is impressive and normal; the unevenness of the work on view is also normal, as the preceding reviews should indicate. For the time being, exhibitions that isolate artists according to ethnic backgrounds or gender are necessary to the genuine diversification within the art world, but one looks forward to their obsolescence.   \\"Ethnic Images in Toys and Games,\\" at the Margaret Melville Blackwell History Museum, scratches the surface of a large and timely subject, and is in some ways a good complement to \\"Our Land/Ourselves.\\" A traveling exhibition organized by the Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies in Philadelphia, the show traces changing social attitudes toward different racial and ethnic groups as reflected in toys and games from the last 100 years. It is an often startling catalogue of mindless and not so mindless prejudice directed at an array of American minorities -- blacks, Chinese, Irish, Mexicans and Indians -- confirming that bigotry can easily begin at home.   Some of the more virulent examples include \\"The Comical Game of Mary-Ann,\\" a board game that features an inept Irish servant with apelike features, the mechanical \\"Jolly Nigger Bank\\" and another mechanical toy named \\"The New Game of Ah Sin the Heathen Chinee,\\" all from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.   But the exhibition's treatment of its subject, like the subject itself, is subtle and complex. It shows how some toys are elitist, rather then explicitly derogatory, in the way they idealize white Americans -- the blond boy on the cover of \\"The Boy Toymaker\\" kit from the 1930's, for example, or, more recently, the original blond Barbie Doll. And it includes toys whose characterizations, while not negative, are perhaps limiting and simplistic: the Italian Mario Brothers of Nintendo fame, for example.   The exhibition does chronicle attempts to correct stereotypes and instill ethnic pride. Hence visitors may contrast an array of black pickaninny and mammy dolls with the \\"Bye-Lo\\" doll, a realistic infant produced in 1923 in two versions, one black, one white, or view a 1989 game called \\"Kosherland.\\"   The show's didactic nature is countered by the careful and balanced text panels and by the addition of dolls and games from the museum's own collection. Bridgehampton    In a sense, Alice Neel's penetrating and dignified images of black and Hispanic people, made in the 1950's when she lived in Spanish Harlem, are a welcome experience after the chronicle of intolerance of the \\"Ethnic Toy\\" exhibition. Neel, who died in 1984 at the age of 84, had no social mission. As this exhibition at the Dia Center for the Arts in Bridgehampton confirms, she was simply painting the people around her, whom she knew and liked and whose faces interested her.   In some ways, Neel at her best combined the skills of a portrait photographer with those of an abstract painter. She was highly sensitive to individual personality; her faces always seem real without being absolutely realistic. But she reveled in paint for its own sake and in the ways it could give skin, furniture and fabric alike an intensified life on canvas.   In \\"Man in Plaid Shirt,\\" a reclining male fixes us with a steady gaze, while his shirt quietly runs riot like a miniature landscape. A similar sense of life infuses the green, yellow and blue diamond-pattern shirt worn by the sitter in \\"Call Me Joe.\\" But again this colorful escapade is bracketed by the force of personality: a grave face, a hand holding a cigarette.   This is a great little show. It gives a glimpse of one of the strongest phases of Neel's career, emphasizing once more that she ranks as one of this century's best portrait painters. East Hampton    This exhibition, at the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center on the eastern fringe of East Hampton, pays tribute to the photographer Hans Namuth, who died last year at the age of 75. Mr. Namuth is especially well known for his photographs of Jackson Pollock at work, dripping paint onto canvas. These images are crucial to an understanding of how the artist formed his extraordinary paintings, and heighten one's sense of their implicit rhythm and choreography. The photographs also contribute to the Pollock myth, portraying him as lean and hungry-looking, in dark T-shirt and jeans -- the closest thing in American art to James Dean.   While this exhibition includes several images of Pollock painting, it also offers a series of pictures taken of Jackson Pollock and the painter Lee Krasner, his wife, throughout a summer day in 1950. Perhaps the most affecting aspect of the show is simply the unusual experience of encountering these images in the house -- in fact in the very corner of the living room -- where they were taken.
