HE WHO DANCES IN SHADOW: Don't know when it happened. Well, I guess it was a Wednesday, but I have no month, no definitive time marker, no broad-based context. Except I was in one of my transitional phases. Restless and deadly curious. I remember thinking I had to go out that night or my thirst for narrative would never be satisfied. I could envision a volume of stories left unlived -- what a waste that would be. I had to go out. And of course, I was right. If I hadn't gone out that night, I would never have met the boy from Albany, and if I had never met the boy from Albany, I would be a greatly diminished person. I was flinging my body around wistfully, with camp aplomb, with my usual, let's call it \\"panache,\\" at the club I went to every Wednesday night because I got on the guest list because I once slept with the D.J., who happens to be the best and corniest D.J. in New York, and as I spun around under the scarlet light and plunged my feet into the plank wood floor I kept catching the eye of a tall skinny guy with a leather cap on holding a juicy blond boy. I kept throwing my eyes on them as I spun and they kept catching them. I never know how to speak to people, so he spoke to me. The skinny one. The boy from Albany. We held eyes and we danced and he did all the information. He had a rebel voice, an outlaw voice, a man voice, with boy eyes and almost no hair. I love a good hard voice spewing obscenities. He had knowledge of the world and anger at it. He had warmth towards people he didn't entirely respect. He jumped as dancing, much like I do, and he was happy. And that's what slayed me. What I couldn't get. Not for the life of me. I stepped out of myself, out of my bouncing body and planned a whole interrogation which never happened. As the light bathed me, as we kissed long and deep, as we threw our bodies across the dance floor, as we kissed and held the blond boy, and especially as I rooted my feet into the floor a foot away from his, leaving him briefly to dance his own dance, as I glared at his separateness, this incredible urge came over me to get the truth from him.

I was warned about this from the beginning, warned that love and loyalty wouldn't help once I attempted a nonfiction account of a year at Kenyon College, my alma mater, my current employer. It was a no-win proposition, a kamikaze flight, an untenured professor's invitation to his own career suicide. And an irresistible idea.\\n\\n How many books have attempted to capture the deep traditions, the insular tensions, the seasonal wars that characterize life at a small American liberal arts college? Who has bothered to record the compromises and betrayals, the wonderful mix of seriousness and silliness? Jarrell, Lurie, McCarthy, Malamud, Malone -- I could name a handful of books, not enough for even the skimpiest syllabus -- and they focused on personal issues and decaying marriages more than on the life of the institution. All those readers, yet so few writers. Something seemed to get in their way.\\n\\n I spent a full year at Kenyon, in Gambier, Ohio, putting myself in the way of as much experience as possible. I lived in the same freshman dorm I'd occupied 30 years before, lectured and graded, sometimes exhilarated, sometimes in despair. Kenyon had its good and bad days and so did I. I followed firing searches, faculty debates, alumni complaints, admissions meetings.\\n\\n The book that resulted, \\"Alma Mater: A College Homecoming,\\" was mixed. How could it be otherwise? You could find evidence in it that Kenyon College was a good, occasionally excellent place, with a prudent administration, able faculty, lively student body. A place worth defending. But that wasn't the whole truth. Some other passages discovered a thin-skinned place, complacent, fractious and adrift, in need of shaping up.\\n\\n I tried to tell the truth and I tried to be fair, to pick, if not pull, my punches. In the end , it would have been easy to write a book that was harsher and it would have been hard to write a book that was gentler. But that was my opinion. There were other opinions, as I discovered when I came back to campus in January.\\n\\n I've always enjoyed returning, as a teacher, to the college where I once was taught. And little Gambier is wonderful even at its bleakest, at the start of second semester, sullen and ominous, a time of salt-stained streets and slushy lawns, gray hillsides and May a light-year away. Perched on an Ohio hilltop, surrounded by farms and scraps of forest, brushed by a river spanned by rusting railroad trestles, Kenyon is the very image of a small residential college, a perfect intersection of thought and growth and haunting memory. But this year I came back worried, like a teen-ager creeping home late at night, parking a just-dented family car in the garage, tiptoeing upstairs and waiting for hard questions -- or pained silences -- at the breakfast table.\\n\\n My absence during first semester had spared me the college's immediate reaction to \\"Alma Mater,\\" which appeared in late November. The student newspaper interviewed Kenyon's president, whose public response was polite, if strained: \\"The critical temper is not surprising since there must be shadows and bright spots to make the book plausible.\\" The dean of admissions declared the book \\"incomplete or not well rounded\\" and a student who \\"forked over the equivalent of three 10-inch sausage, pineapple and cheddar cheese pizzas\\" to buy my book pronounced herself well satisfied. In early December, hundreds of students and faculty packed into Philomathesian Hall, a dark wood lecture hall with stained glass windows, for a campus-wide forum on my book. The meeting seems to have been a mix of damage control, celebration, group therapy and in-absentia trial.\\n'Brutal but Honest'\\n\\nLater, listening to a bootleg tape, blurry and indistinct, I feel as if I'm eavesdropping on a jury room. I am criticized, I am generously defended. I am \\"brutal but honest,\\" one voice declares, I am Kenyon's \\"somewhat disappointed lover,\\" said another. Somebody -- could my ears be deceiving me? -- compares me to J. D. Salinger. Others, no doubt, are picturing Benedict Arnold.\\n\\n Soon after, reports started coming in from outside: concern among Kenyon parents, prospective donors up in arms, irate alumni sniffing treason. \\"Are we going to rescind the s.o.b.'s degree?\\" one old-timer inquired.\\n\\n The wisest decision, I supposed, would have been not to return at all. That's the writer's usual pattern. You research and report, you immerse yourself, indiscriminately, because anything might be material. Then you withdraw to write. And when that's over your withdrawal becomes escape, even if it's only to another book. But I returned to Gambier to witness the consequences of my writing, the judgement of my judgements, my work worked over.\\n\\n \\"I'm surprised they let you back in town,\\" joked a college security officer when he saw me on my first night back. \\"Are you working on your resume?\\" inquired a former student. \\"Have you seen the president yet?\\" \\"Have you talked to the president's wife?\\" Those questions set the pattern, a probing, almost prurient interest that was less about the book than about its impact on the college, on applications and admissions, on other people. The issue wasn't whether the book was good, but whether it was good -- or bad -- for Kenyon and for me.\\n\\n The impact of the book is, as they like to say at colleges, problematic, The college goes about its work, confronting lower enrollments, staff reductions, budget cutbacks, increased concern about the cost of liberal arts education and skepticism about its benefits. It's a time of austerity, anxiety and anger. \\"The future will resemble the present... or worse,\\" Kenyon's president warned a faculty meeting just the other day.\\n\\n All of this suggests that here or elsewhere there'll be plenty of material for other books on college life, and so I offer some advice to other writers who enter this green, cloistered arena.\\n\\n Think carefully about whether to tell them what you're up to. How deliciously tempting it was to consider writing \\"Alma Mater\\" on the sly. I knew from other years at Kenyon the richness of the material that would come to me, unsought. Every secret is meant to be told, sooner or later. At a small campus, you don't have to wait so long. But I decided it wouldn't be fair to ambush Kenyon. I announced my intentions and lived with the substantial costs.\\n\\n Some people turned sullen, or skeptical, or strenously -- unquotably -- polite. With others, the opposite happened, and I confronted those statements that hang in the air like ballooned utterances over the heads of cartoon characters, statements begging \\"quote me! quote me!\\" And then there were those tenured professors, their jobs protected in the name of free speech, who nonetheless specified that they were going \\"off the record\\" or \\"not for attribution,\\" as if we were trading Oval Office secrets in a Washington parking garage.\\n\\n Realize that not everyone will admire your work. It wasn't just what I said about, say, spousal hiring or grade inflation. My opinions could be discounted as an old grad's nostalgia, or the meanderings of a part-time hire, or the glibness of a journalist out of his depth. But what about the people I quoted and the things they said about each other? Reporting old battles, I threatened to start new ones. And what about the people I never mentioned at all? Wouldn't they be hurt the most? And then there were alumni who wanted only the best for their alma mater, and that meant reading only the best. And Kenyon parents, paying more than $20,000 per year to educate their kids, didn't want their investment devalued. I didn't mean to dash their hopes, but somebody had to tell them that quality is a sometime thing, even at good schools, that we produce wonderful graduates and amazing goof-offs and that I didn't mean for them to think less of Kenyon but to think more about it.\\n\\nAcknowledge that trying to be fair about academe is like building a house on an earthquake fault. Every college is a network of factions and fissures, tremors and spasms, shallow and deep. We have people who are delighted to teach and read and others who stress research","excerpt":"some who'd love to stay here forever, others chafing to move on. There are easy graders and there are martinets, professors who aim to humanize the B students of the world -- since they're the ones who end up running it -- and professors who measure success by the number of A students who get into graduate schools and try, against cruel odds, to become professors.\\n\\nSome professors are content with the student body -- mostly middle class or upper, mostly white -- that finds its way here and pays to come. Others press for diversity, change and outreach. Some of my colleagues believe that the continued existence of fraternities at Kenyon is a moral and intellectual affront. Others say that people who find themselves in the middle of rural Ohio have a right to form groups, give parties and do foolish things occasionally.\\nA Diverse Group\\n\\n The student body includes superlative kids who struggle for still-elusive A grades and others who settle cheerfully for the ubiquitous B. (No one puts up with C's; these are life-destroying insults.) We have students for whom Kenyon is magic, a life-enhancing experience, and others for whom it's a slapdash passage from summer camp to country club. We have students who love to write, and others who hate to read. I tried to find room for all of them in my book.\\n\\nBut equity had its cost. To some it was a cop-out, sterile and timid. People wanted to see other people gotten -- wanted me to see things their way, fire broadsides where they had only sniped, cut my throat where they swallowed their tongues. Get those fraternity drunks, those whining feminists, those crusty political scientists, those radical-chic historians, that suave, smooth-talking president, that dithering provost. But I used thumb tacks in a place that wanted nails. \\n\\nIn the end, though, it was worth it. People's welcoming reactions -- not that they agreed with every point -- overwhelmed the hostile. There were letters from today's students and those of 30 years ago. This from a student I don't know, studying overseas this year: \\"What happens at Kenyon occurs everywhere but is magnified 100 times at a community-oriented institution because every action is taken personally. I hope that I will see you around next year but, if not, good book.\\" Another student said, \\"You captured the Kenyon I love, and the Kenyon I know, and the Kenyon I want the college to become.\\" \\n\\nI've heard from teachers and administrators, some still here, others who've moved on to other places and who look back at Kenyon, sometimes with hurt, sometimes affection, often both. Just lately there've been letters from people at other institutions who assure me that Kenyon's problems, and virtues, are not unique. Late afternoons and weekends, hiding in my office, I'm greeted by people who want to talk -- total strangers who drive to this small Ohio village to see the special place I wrote about.\\nSense of Connection\\n\\n The best thing about writing about a real place -- and returning to face the consequences -- is the sense of connection between your work and your audience. Five books preceded \\"Alma Mater,\\" and the story was always the same: some reviews, modest sales, a rapid withdrawal from shelves where books last no longer than a cup of yogurt in a supermarket. Working on the next book, revving up energy and hopes for a new project, I've been haunted by the fate of my earlier efforts. \\n\\nThis time was different: the meetings, the talk, the body English, the hugs and stares, and glares, the letters and gossip, the 700 copies sold in the college bookstore and the first-time chance that, at least in this part of Ohio, a book of mine will outlive its author. Any book is an act of caring and a kind of tribute. It's a gift. It distinguishes its subject from all the unremarked places, the ones that never get written about at all. Maybe your college -- your parents -- will understand it. Maybe they won't. If not today, maybe tomorrow.

Orion Books. $65.     Photographers and soldier-cartoonists left the most important pictorial record of World War II. Robert Capa, Margaret Bourke-White, Peter Paris and scores of other photographers focused on the war fronts. The two unforgettable cartoonists who got closest to the real lives and thoughts of soldiers were Sgt. Bill Mauldin, creator of \\"Up Front,\\" featuring the unshaven Willie and Joe, which appeared in the Mediterranean editions of Stars and Stripes, the Army newspaper, and Sgt. George Baker, creator of the bedraggled little enlisted man called the Sad Sack in a strip of the same name that ran in Yank, the Army magazine. Sergeants Mauldin and Baker exposed the harsh realities of combat and the frustrations of military life from the inside with sardonic humor and poignancy.    During the same period in the 1940's, an untold number of Allied and Axis illustrators and painters put their pens and brushes to work in the service of their countries and their art. Most of them were civilians whose work did not appear in the military publications, which seldom printed in color. Some were already well-known artists","excerpt":"some worked as propagandists in paint for the benefit of the state and armed services; some were moved to portray the lives of beleaguered people in and out of uniform so that the events would never be forgotten. Whether for patriotic or personal reasons, they felt wartime was no time to paint bowls of fruit.      These overlooked artists are now represented in a highly original and historic work, \\"Images of War,\\" which provides a rare worldwide portrait of the home and war fronts. The book is edited by Ken McCormick, former editor in chief of Doubleday, and Hamilton Darby Perry, an author and editor who served on a PT boat during the Normandy invasion. In a moving foreword, John Hersey, who saw some of these artists at work while a war correspondent in the Pacific and Mediterranean theaters, tells why it is necessary to portray and remember the human side of war to this day:    \\"In the din of all the discussion of weaponry in the years since World War II -- talk of ICBM's, B-1's, Stealth bombers, Soviet XX-25's, MX missiles, Pershings, the hypothetical hardware of Star Wars and all the rest -- we have become inclined to think of warfare as something buyable, abstract, high-tech, mechanized, more or less automated. The images presented here, of moments in the last great war as seen through the eyes of highly individuated artists on both sides of the conflict, remind us that war is not fought by machines, and that the cost is not to be reckoned in dollars of national debt. War, these very human artists remind us, is fought by human beings. The cost is in human values and human lives.\\"    What makes \\"Images of War\\" a rare assemblage of art and text is that it is international in outlook and well-balanced in its presentation. That could happen only after the passage of decades; it says something about the changed world that \\"Images of War\\" happens to be printed in Japan. Insofar as it is possible to be evenhanded about a war that included German concentration camps and harsh Japanese prison camps (not to mention the relocation camps that held thousands of Americans of Japanese descent in the Western United States), Mr. McCormick and Mr. Perry have succeeded in being \\"nonpolitical and nonnationalistic\\" in selecting these paintings.      Some 200 artists from 12 countries are represented in \\"Images of War.\\" The book includes 50 Soviet paintings, most not seen before in the West, from state museums in Leningrad, Moscow and Kiev. Japanese paintings come from the National Modern Art Museum in Tokyo; German paintings from the Bavarian Army Museum; Italian paintings from three national museums in Milan; war museums in London, Ottawa and Canberra contribute paintings by British and Commonwealth artists. A major source of the American paintings -- which include works by such well-known artists as Thomas Hart Benton, Joseph Hirsch, George Biddle and Tom Lea -- are the combat art collections maintained by all the services in Washington.    Surprisingly, there is only one painting by Henry Moore, \\"Women and Children in the Tube,\\" from the Imperial War Museum in London. It is by no means the best of the brilliant series of \\"shelter drawings\\" he did of families huddled together in the Underground during the bombings of civilian targets in London by the Luftwaffe. What is particularly commendable is that all through the book -- in the spirit of \\"The 'Good War,' \\" by Studs Terkel -- there are excerpts by war participants that supplement the paintings.    Speaking of the Blitz, a Royal Air Force fighter pilot says, \\"Victory was not in sight, yet the thought of defeat never entered our young minds.\\" And a Luftwaffe pilot officer says: \\"You rarely acknowledge the fact that you have killed a human. It blunts the senses. I didn't like the feeling of the victim having an identity, a name.\\"    \\"Images of War\\" covers nearly all the theaters: from the blitzkrieg in 1939 to the battles in North Africa, the island invasions and carrier wars in the Pacific, the final offensives on the Russian and European fronts, the liberation of the death camps and the Nuremberg trial of German war criminals. Like the drawings by Sergeants Mauldin and Baker, the paintings by these artists do not glorify war. The impression left by these realistic paintings is that of a sobering statement against war.

ABOUT LONG ISLAND"},{"year":"1991","title":"FLEMINGTON\\n\\nA VISIT to Dr. Gerald Barad comes with a warning. \\"Keep your elbows in,\\" he says, \\"and don't step back.\\"\\n\\nDr. Barad is alluding to some of the living hazards along a narrow pathway of the greenhouse at his home outside Flemington. Here, thousands and thousands of cactus and succulent plants of all descriptions are thriving under his care.\\n\\nThey range from rare seedlings the size of frozen peas to familiar-looking spiny volleyballs to trees with swordlike leaves struggling against the peaked glass roof, which is considerably taller than its owner's 6 feet 5 inches. \\n\\nSome of the succulents cascade from hanging pots","excerpt":"some, in pots on shelves, cluster in gray-green rosettes like bridal bouquets; others, the lithoptera, just sit there like the stones they mimick. And still other species have sprouted flowers in shades from pastel to vibrant. \\n\\nDr. Barad cannot say for certain how many plants the greenhouse contains. \\"Seven thousand seems about right,\\" he said.\\n\\nThree years ago, he retired after more than three decades of practicing obstetrics and gynecology in Flemington. He now devotes himself full time to his lifelong interest in horticulture, particularly desert plants. \\nPropagating Rare Plants \\n\\n In addition to tending the 21-year-old greenhouse, propagating and hybridizing rare desert plants and whipping around the world looking for others, he is president of the Cactus and Succulent Society of America, an organization of 4,000 hobbyists and professional plant scientists devoted to protecting, propagating and fostering interest in desert plants.\\n\\nDr. Barad is also a dedicated volunteer at the New York Botanical Garden, where he serves as chairman of the desert plant committee, leads tours, gives slide lectures, holds workshops and helps out at the annual plant sale in May. \\n\\n\\"I'm too busy now,\\" he said, brandishing a sheet of paper from his newest assistant, a home fax machine. \\"Maybe I should go back to work.\\" \\n\\nDr. Barad's collection, which he started in the late 1950's, is impressive even to professionals. \\"For a private collection, it's truly extraordinary,\\" said Richard Schnall, vice president for horticulture at the New York Botanical Garden. \\"We don't know of anything else on that scale in this area.\\" \\n\\nSeymour Linden, a retired Los Angeles research chemist, cactus specialist and immediate past president of the Cactus and Succulent Society, calls Dr. Barad's operation \\"fantastic -- one of the great private collections of succulents in the world.\\"\\n\\nFortunately, Dr. Barad's plants don't need constant attention, since much of his time these days is spent with his wife, Beatrice, on trips and meetings related to cactus society affairs. \\"We've made lifetime friends from all over the world through this organization,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\nAs he led a visitor (carefully) through his New Jersey desert, Dr. Barad was asked the difference between cactuses and succulents. \\"A succulent, from the Latin succulentus, meaning juicy, is any plant that stores water and has a fleshy body,\\" he said. \\"A cactus is one type of succulent.\\" \\n\\nBut not every succulent is a cactus. What makes a plant a cactus, among other defining characteristics, is what many people call needles and botanists call areoles -- the spiny cushions from which flowers and new buds form.\\nWatering Is 'Complicated' \\n\\n How often do the plants get watered? \\"It's a complex business,\\" Dr. Barad said. \\"With the cacti, in winter, we stop watering in late October and don't water again until late Feburary. With other succulents, it's more complicated. The lithops are quite fussy.\\"\\n\\nIn short, watering a succulent depends on the moisture requirements of the individual plant. \\n\\nThe 3,000-square-foot greenhouse is divided by a glass wall into two environments. The smaller, about one-third of the space, is kept warm and moist, with banana and coffee plants, a goldfish pond and hanging orchids -- \\"a few, just for decoration,\\" Dr. Barad said. \\n\\nThe larger portion, cooler and drier, is given over to the rare desert plants from all around the globe. Dr. Barad collected many of them himself in places like Australia, Japan, India, the Sudan, Somalia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and the Middle East. \\nSharing Their Finds \\n\\n \\"The only justification for taking a rare plant is to propagate and preserve it,\\" Dr. Barad said, citing the satisfaction that he and his colleagues experience when they bring rare plants back from the edge of extinction, sharing their finds with botanical collections all over the world. \\n\\nHis specialty is African desert plants, particularly unusual groups of succulents called stapelias. These are bumpy, leathery plants that look like thornless cactuses and are difficult to grow and even more difficult to pollinate artificially. Stapelias are related to the common milkweed, with the same silky parachute seeds. \\n\\n\\nDr. Barad took down a plastic pot. In it was a cluster of tiny yellow-green shoots found nowhere else in the world. They are a new variety of stapelia that he created under a microscope. \\n\\n\\"This plant's reproductive cells are so tiny you can't use the usual method of artificial pollination with a small camel-hair brush,\\" he said. \\n\\nTo pollinate these plants, Dr. Barad performs a surgical procedure that involves microscopic hooks made from the steel suture material used in human eye surgery. In nature, \\"flies usually do this type of work,\\" he said. \\"It's a lot harder for me, because I'm a lot bigger.\\"\\n\\nHe has published an article in the cactus society's journal explaining how he joins the cells under a microscope. \\n\\nAs Dr. Barad made his rounds, he paused to check on the progress of more newborns, to turn on a hose, to prune stragglers or to snip a few dead leaves.\\n\\nDr. Barad, who grew up in Brooklyn and inherited his love of plants from his mother, said he could not remember a time when he was not fascinated by growing things. \\"At age 7 or 8, I traveled 40 minutes alone on the BMT to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden for children's programs,\\" he said. \\nDreams of a Country Home \\n\\n When he entered Cornell University, he was one of the few agriculture majors from Brooklyn. He intended to be a plant pathologist.\\n\\nThen came World War II and his studies were interrupted by his service with the Army Medical Corps. The experience prompted a switch to premedical studies when he returned to school, but he continued to dream of owning a country home. \\n\\nAfter the war, he also resumed his courtship with his future wife, whom he had known since they were both 15. The couple were married in 1946. \\n\\nAs a student at the Cornell Medical Center and resident at Bellevue Hospital, he sought plants willing to thrive on a Manhattan windowsill with little care. Succulents were the obvious answer.\\n\\n\\"We became intrigued by their fascinating growth patterns, their symmetry, oddness and beauty,\\" said Dr. Barad, who is also a skilled plant photographer.\\n\\nIn 1957, the Barads moved to 23 panoramic acres in Hunterdon County, 10 minutes south of the Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington, where Dr. Barad set up his private practice. On their piece of paradise, the Barads raised four children as well as numerous animals, vegetables and flowers and -- with the addition of the greenhouse in 1970 -- succulents under glass. \\n\\nDr. Barad still gardens outdoors, too. He pointed out his collection of Alpine plants snuggled in a rock garden and a new deer-scaring device he rigged up. Mounted on a tree, it involves a motion-sensitive light to spook deer sneaking up at night. \\n\\nDoes it work? \\"We'll see,\\" he said. \\"I have yet to connect it.\\"\\n\\nRather than an esoteric hobby, Dr. Barad's avocation might be considered merely an extension of his career. The patients may be quieter, but he continues to perform surgery, administer treatments and bring new babies into the world.

(Nov. 24), does not agree with the museum's curator, Sidra Stich, on many things except that \\"When World War II ended and Europe had to rise again from the ashes, Surrealism was over.\\"   A generation ago, American critics and curators agreed that Surrealism was over much earlier: 1939 was most commonly designated for its demise. Now seven years have been quietly added to the movement's life.   In 1965, when my wife, Penelope, and I went to Paris to visit Andre Breton, we found that the Surrealist group was still meeting daily at a Les Halles cafe delightfully called La Promenade de Venus.    Twenty-five to 50 people attended these lively gatherings each evening. Most of them were in their 30's","excerpt":"some, like Penelope and myself, were younger. Andre Breton, his wife, Elisa, Jehan Mayoux and the Czech painter Toyen were the only elders among the regulars.    Many of the friends we made there in those days -- Enrico Baj, Jean Benoit, Vincent Bounoure, Jorge Camacho, Annie LeBrun, Joyce Mansour, Mimi Parent, to mention only a few of those whose participation in Surrealism began in the 1950's or 60's -- have since become well-known writers or artists, at least in Europe. European critics generally choose to end surrealism with Breton's death in 1966 or three years later, when the Paris group disbanded in a flurry of factional turmoil.   But all obituaries of Surrealism have been premature. As the Surrealists always insisted, Surrealism is unlike other literary and artistic tendencies; its proper analogues are not regional and such short-lived avant-gardes as Fauvism, Cubism or Abstract Expressionism, but rather such broad cultural movements as Hermeticism, Romanticism and anarchism, which have blossomed in very different times and places, and have proved to be always and everywhere renewable -- especially when and where critics aren't looking.   Your review speaks of the \\"strong Czechoslovak contingent\\" in \\"Anxious Visions.\\" In October-November, the Surrealist group in Czechoslovakia held a well-attended exhibition of its own at the Galerie Neuf in Paris. The Czech group was founded by Karel Teige and others in 1933 and has carried on an uninterrupted agitation ever since. After 1948, its efforts were largely clandestine, but with the collapse of the Stalinist dictatorship last year, the group has burst into the open again with activities and publications, including two large issues of an exceptionally vibrant journal, Analagon.   If there's any truth in the saying now going around that \\"Things will happen in the 90's that'll make the 60's look like the 50's,\\" wider awareness of Surrealism's continuing vitality may be coming sooner than you think.

Encouraged by Wallace, Kosinski was telling parts of the story of his life that night. Wallace, no mean master of theatrics himself, knew a spellbinder when he had one at his dinner table.

The president of NBC Entertainment, Kevin Reilly, said yesterday that the network had asked the show's creators to produce a sequence of ''Webisodes'' and to write an initial batch of scripts, with the expectation that their efforts would evolve into a prime-time series in the coming season. While stopping short of committing NBC to ordering the series, Mr. Reilly said in a presentation to journalists yesterday in Pasadena, Calif., that he was optimistic about the venture and had particular confidence in Bill Lawrence, a creator of ''Nobody's Watching'' and the NBC series ''Scrubs.'' Mr. Reilly said he had not yet decided whether the mini-episodes would appear on the Web site YouTube -- from which viewers have downloaded ''Nobody's Watching'' more than 600,000 times, according to NBC -- or on the network's own site.

The author, whose novels were highly praised in the 1940's and 50's, describes growing up as an orphan in turn-of-the-century Massachusetts with her identical twin sister, who died in a swimming accident at the age of 14. In 1966 our reviewer, Diana Trilling, called this slender book an ''extraordinarily poignant memoir of her quite extraordinary childhood.''    Preston Falls  By David Gates. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.    At the center of this novel is a cynical, highly unlovable public relations executive who takes a couple of months off to fix up his family's getaway house in upstate New York. After a fight with his wife lands him in jail, he hooks up with a lawyer who lures him into cocaine trafficking. This scary tale of male vanity and the dark underbelly of middle age was selected as one of the best books of 1998 by the editors of the Book Review. ''You're almost afraid to go back to the book once you've put it down,'' Michael Wood wrote here last year. ''Anything could happen, and it's likely to be horrible, irremediable.''    One Nation, After All. What Middle-Class Americans  Really Think About: God, Country, Family, Racism, Welfare, Immigration, Homosexuality, Work, the Right, the Left, and Each Other  By Alan Wolfe. Penguin, $13.95.    Sifting through interviews with 200 middle-class folks of all stripes, a sociologist discovers far more sympathy for civil rights, women's rights and religious diversity than people often get credit for. This optimistic survey ''is a fascinating and often stirring tour through an America that the news media and would-be culture warriors seem not to know,'' Brent Staples wrote in these pages in 1998. In Civility: Manners, Morals, and the Etiquette of Democracy, by Stephen L. Carter (Harper Perennial, $13), a law professor explores the idea of civility (and incivility) from the evolution of Euro-American etiquette to censorship in cyberspace, and urges a more civil national discourse, especially where matters of faith are concerned. ''His meditations on the tensions between democracy and religion display . . . eloquence and independence of mind,'' Michael Lind wrote here last year.    Birthday Letters  By Ted Hughes. Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $12.    The subject of these poems is Hughes's stormy relationship with Sylvia Plath, and the result is an inevitably one-sided rebuke to those who see him as the villain in Plath's 1963 suicide. Last year our reviewer, Katha Pollitt, praised the ''emotional, direct, regretful, entranced'' tone that ''pervades the book's strongest poems, which are quiet and thoughtful and conversational.'' The same publisher has issued Tales From Ovid ($14), in which Hughes tackles the ironic, urbane Ovid of ancient Rome","excerpt":"somehow the pairing clicks. ''The result is that rare thing -- an inspired act of translation that stands as vigorous poetry in its own right,'' James Shapiro wrote here in 1997. ''This book brilliantly succeeds at bringing Ovid's passionate and disturbing stories to life.''    Be Sweet: A Conditional Love Story  By Roy Blount Jr. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13    The humorist's unflinching account of his Georgia childhood has everything to do with his mother, Louise, a difficult woman whose mystery haunts her son into adulthood. '' 'Be Sweet' is both literary and down-home, a thinking man's thigh slapper'' and ''a serious heartbreaker,'' Josephine Humphreys wrote here last year.    The Life of Insects  By Victor Pelevin. Penguin, $11.95.    The human characters in this slippery Russian novel morph back and forth into bugs -- chief among them are a trio of voracious investors/mosquitoes and a sexy fly named Natasha. ''Political allegory, antic fantasy, willful enigma: Victor Pelevin's latest book . . . is a little of all three,'' Michael Upchurch said here in 1998.    A Short History of Byzantium  By John Julius Norwich. Vintage, $17.    This condensed version of the author's three-volume history starts with the founding of Constantinople in 330 and its fall in 1453. ''Lord Norwich has sacrificed none of the virtues of the longer work: lively narration and a taste for the eccentric anecdote and revelatory detail,'' Michael Anderson wrote here in 1997. From the Holy Mountain: A Journey Among the Christians of the Middle East, by William Dalrymple (Owl/Holt, $16.95), retraces the path of two monks who traveled in the Byzantine Empire in the late sixth and early seventh centuries. ''Dalrymple is the professor whose obscure lectures you attend just so you can hear him talk,'' Ted Conover wrote here in 1998.    The Illusionist  By Dinitia Smith. Scribner, $12.    This novel by a reporter for The New York Times is about an androgynous man who coasts into a rural New York town and the tragedy that results when three lonely women are drawn into his web. The story's ''greatest strength is the sensitivity with which Smith explores the complexities of love,'' Edward Hower wrote here in 1997.    Skin Deep  By Diana Wagman. University of Mississippi, $15.    A former topless waitress enters into a peculiar relationship with a young doctor who pays her well to shroud herself completely in blue and talk about beauty. In 1997 our reviewer, Courtney Weaver, called this ''a curious and disturbing'' first novel.

The curtain raiser was \\"Snake Alley\\" (1989), by David Dzubay, a composer in his late 20's. Like many young composers, Mr. Dzubay writes in an eclectic style, which is essentially tonal, but which raids atonal techniques when they suit the work's thrust. In a way, this is a comic-book piece, painted mostly in bright primary colors and describing an exotic and sometimes scary journey through an alley in Taipei.

The celebrated detective Inspector McKenzie of Scotland Yard, was standing surrounded by disappointment and what is called a typical London fog. He looked sadly into the distance where the estimable Mr. Raffles—the cricket player—had just departed along the road to Paris and a new leaf in the book of life.Outwitting the Yard had not been easy, Inspector McKenzie being, as he said, Scotch. But with the aid of a girl, a pistol, a small coil of rope, a grandfather clock and a storm cape Mr. Raffles had finally been able to bring it about. And so, starting for France instead of Amsterdam—the diamond market of the world—he was free of all retribution due him as The Amateur Cracksman. The Yard was annoyed, of course, but not too much.\\"You can't help liking him,\\" remarked the Inspector.Now, \\"Raffles\\" has been played before along and near the theatrical haunts of New York and London. Since E. W. Hornung wrote the stories which gave the gentlemanly crook to the world and a new word to the language, such diverse personages as Sir Gerald DuMaurier, the late Kyrle Bellew and John Barrymore attempted cricket bowling and safe-cracking with equal (and in one case, at least, silent) abandon. Ronald Colman, who mainly operates in the current edition, is, therefore, moving in good company.The new \\"Raffles\\" is not, however, the picture by which Sidney Howard, Samuel Goldwyn or Mr. Colman will be longest remembered. It is a film of which even the most ardent admirer of any one of the above trio would say only \\"good—but.\\" And after that it is difficult to find the reason for the negation. Possibly there are moments of slowness now at the Rialto, possibly some of the lines sound a trifle out of key. Or it might be a recollection of Mr. Colman's \\"Bulldog Drummond.\\"\\"Raffles\\" has just one exciting incident—the escape of the amateur cracksman from the toils of the Yard. Doors slam, pistols are shot, others are on the verge of being shot and the hero of it all finally emerges from his cramped quarters in the bottom of the clock. But before that are sequences of how love comes to a thief—and what it does to him—and interludes of a nature not particularly comic.Mr. Colman seems at home throughout most of the picture's length—either at cricket or as man-about-town or as the cracksman. At the end he strolls forth in the inspector's cape, about as calmly as he had earlier strolled through love scenes. These, of course, were with Gwen, a rôle taken by Kay Francis and one which occasionally seemed a trifle musical-comedyish.The story of \\"Raffles\\" must be fairly familiar by now. All of London, deep in its fog, is dismayed by the antics of the cracksman. The police try their best, but cannot lay their hands upon him. No one thinks to connect him with the famous cricket player. No one, that is, until the inspector, learning of a potential robbery, visits the home of Lord Melrose and finds Mr. Raffles in circumstances that are more than circumstantial.The dénouement, as it is called, comes a little later at the Raffles apartment. The cracksman has confessed to Gwen, and when the inspector appears he makes another confession. But before he can be escorted suitably from there he dodges away into another room and the clock. And finally, dressing in the police coat, he goes away to the salutes of subordinates. And so to Paris.Finally, it should be said that an audience that jammed the theatre yesterday obviously liked Mr. Colman and \\"Raffles\\" very much.There are also several short subjects on the program.

''Stopping for Green Lights'' explores the hopeless desire of a white teen-ager, Tish Espy, to be black, in a time (the late 1960's) and place (a university town near Cleveland) where the realities of poverty and racism are more powerful than the lip service paid to integration. Tish is alienated from the white elite at school -- she prefers to hang out with black girls, who accept her with a teasing affection -- and from her liberal parents, whose caution toward her friendships with African-Americans reveals their confusion, if not their hypocrisy. Tish is constantly aware of ''the double lexicon of her friends, the idiom that circumvented white people. . . . When they talked about white people, she knew they didn't really mean her, but then, where did that put her? Sometimes she felt great relief","excerpt":"sometimes it just about broke her heart.'' In her search for identity, she falls in love with a young black man who betrays her in a manner that's common to people of all colors, provoking the reflections that mark her coming of age. Miller's portrait of Tish's boyfriend and the book's other African-Americans is thoughtful and rich, but she never presumes an intimate knowledge beyond her white character's point of view. Yet by joining Tish's struggle for belonging with the larger issue of what it means to be black -- or white -- in this country, Miller employs the energy of adolescent angst to expose the divisions in our society.

Called ''Votives,'' they are - I suppose - to be taken literally as offerings to the gods. In these, on view at the Guggenheim Museum, Fifth Avenue and 89th Street (through Nov. 25), the figures and symbols of his painting, now shaped from the thinnest of gold sheet or clear acrylic, are deployed in small Plexiglas boxes, often - despite their scale - to dramatic effect.

Opera   AMATO OPERA. The homespun but attractive qualities of this company's productions, and the intimacy of its shoe-box theater offer a useful change of perspective for operagoers used to the big houses uptown. The casts here vary: at the very least the singers are eager and enthusiastic","excerpt":"sometimes the singing shows great promise. And Anthony Amato, the company's founder, conducts the performances with an evident love of the music. Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' is currently on the boards. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m. the Amato Opera, 319 Bowery at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $25, $20 for the elderly and children. (Allan Kozinn).     ''IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA.'' The cast changes continue in the Metropolitan Opera's production of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia.'' The excellent mezzo-soprano Theodora Hanslowe sings Rosina, and the tenor Michael Shade is the poor student she loves who turns out to be, of course, Count Almaviva. The baritone Russell Braun is the clever, indispensable Figaro, so much more than the town barber. And Paul Plishka, a Met veteran who owns the role of Dr. Bartolo, sings it again. Bruno Campanella conducts. Metropolitan Opera House; tonight at 8, (212) 362-2000. Tickets: $26 to $225; sold out but returns may be available (Anthony Tommasini).     ''LA BOHEME,'' Metropolitan Opera. Yet again, all Paris descends on the Latin Quarter in Act II of Puccini's opera, and viewers will get their fill. Listeners are another matter. In Franco Zeffirelli's extravaganza of a production, from 1981, it is hard for any singer of less than Pavarottian amplitude in both voice and physique even to register, let alone make a vivid impression. Certainly, Leontina Vaduva and Luis Lima, in the lead roles, did not exactly shine on opening night. Oh, well; there is always that wonderful orchestra, mercurially conducted here by Marco Armiliato. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $26 to $225; sold out but returns may be available (James R. Oestreich).     ''CARMEN.'' The New York City Opera's colorful, effective production of Bizet's ''Carmen'' offers the mezzo-soprano Angela Horn in the title role. The hefty-voiced tenor Carl Tanner, who had been singing Mario in the company's updated production of ''Tosca,'' switches to Bizet's Don Jose. The soprano Barbara Shirvis will be Micaela and the baritone Jorge Lagunes will sing Escamillo. New York State Theater, tonight at 8, (212) 496-0600. Tickets: $22 to $95 (Tommasini).     ''LA CLEMENZA DI TITO.'' Harry Bicket conducts a lively, moving and thrilling New York City Opera performance of Mozart's glorious late score. The cast is led by Lorraine Hunt Lieberson in superb form as Sesto, caught between friendship for -- and loyalty to -- the emperor on the one side and sheer blind love for the scheming Vitellia on the other. Marie Plette, as Vitellia, achieves majesty when she gives up hope of the throne. Mark Thomsen takes over from Kurt Streit in the title role. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York Theater, (212) 496-0600. Tickets: $22 to $95 (Paul Griffiths).     ''LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR.'' Since the Dicapo Opera presents three productions a weekend, the company, understandably, double-casts roles in demanding works. This weekend's production of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' at its intimate theater on East 76th Street, is one example. The title role will offer, alternately, the sopranos Oleksandra Hrabova and Indira Mahajan. The tenors Barton Green and Emmanuel di Villarosa share the role of Edgardo; and the baritones Gregory Keil and David Templeton do the same with Enrico. The bass Ding Gao has the role of Raimondo to himself. The production, sung in Italian, is directed by Michael Capasso and conducted by Valery Ryvkin. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438 or (212) 759-7653. Tickets: $33 (Tommasini).     ''THE MOTHER OF US ALL,'' New York City Opera. Although this inscrutable work by Virgil Thomson and Gertrude Stein was written well before Lauren Flanigan was born, it seems to have been written for her. At the opening of this new production, Ms. Flanigan sang the title role of the suffragist Susan B. Anthony with fervor, sensitivity and sheer flowing beauty. Christopher Alden's direction seemed strenuous and earthbound, making more of the circus aspects of Thomson and Stein's conception than of the humane sensibility that lay underneath. In this context, Ms. Flanigan's touching portrayal was even more remarkable. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $22 to $95 (Oestreich).     ''PELLEAS ET MELISANDE.'' Jonathan Miller's somber and affecting version of Debussy's great turn-of-the-century opera has returned to the Met with a marvelous American and English cast. Featured are Dawn Upshaw, Dwayne Croft, Willard White and Robert Lloyd. James Levine conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-2000. Tickets: $26 to $225; sold out but returns may be available (Bernard Holland).     ''TANIKO''/''DER JASAGER.'' The Nohgaku-za of Tokyo perform ''Taniko,'' about a sick boy's decision to sacrifice himself for the good of the group. So quiet, so slow, so stylized, the drama comes across as powerful, immediate and real. The same story, but with all the pathos, intensity, grace, wisdom and humanity taken out, is the basis for ''Der Jasager,'' by Brecht and Weill, which is presented by American performers in the second half. Today at 7:30 p.m., tomorrow at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan (212) 832-1155. Tickets: $55; $50 for members (Griffiths).     ''TOSCA.'' Television viewers recently got a chance to see Mark Lamos's spare, modern production of Puccini's ''Tosca'' for the New York City Opera, set in 1930's Italy, when ''Live From Lincoln Center'' carried it over PBS. For tomorrow night's performance, the soprano Holly Hall takes over the title role. The cast includes the tenor Alfredo Portilla as Tosca's politically radical lover, Mario Cavaradossi, and the baritone Jeffrey Kneebone as the villainous chief of police, Baron Scarpia. Small flaws aside, this is an evening of compelling musical theater. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, (212) 496-0600. Tickets: $22 to $95 (Tommasini).     Classical Music     AMSTERDAM BAROQUE ORCHESTRA AND CHOIR. Lincoln Center, in its Great Performers series, is doing its part, and maybe more, to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Bach's death. Here, some will say, it is going too far, in a reconstruction of Bach's lost ''St. Mark Passion'' by Ton Koopman that fits out a surviving text with music from other Bach works as well as bits newly composed. Mr. Koopman has already recorded the work with these forces for Erato, and, as there, the performance will undoubtedly be persuasive on its own terms. Still, don't believe everything you hear. Sunday at 4 p.m., Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $38 (Oestreich).     BACHMANN-KLIBONOFF-FRIDMAN TRIO. This fine young piano trio is offering a series of programs that explore a great expanse of the repertory and are organized geographically. The current installment looks at Russian music by way of works by Stravinsky, Prokofiev and Mussorgsky. Tonight at 7 (with a preconcert talk at 6:30), Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-0008, extension 347. Tickets: $30, $20 for library members (Kozinn).     BARGEMUSIC. The arrival of spring increases the always considerable attraction of concerts at this floating concert hall on the East River: if the weather is warm, concertgoers can take a glass of wine on the upper deck during intermission. Not that the musical attractions are not sufficient. Tonight and Sunday afternoon the program includes big string works -- the Schubert Trio in B flat, the Mendelssohn Quintet in the same key and Tchaikovsky's lush sextet ''Souvenir de Florence.'' The players are Mark Peskanov and Julie Rosenfeld, violinists; Toby Hoffman and Paul Cortese, violists; and Deliana Momtchilova and Ronald Thomas, cellists. Tomorrow afternoon Mr. Peskanov is playing a recital -- works by Dvorak, Sibelius, Kreisler and Sarasate -- with Doris Stevenson at the piano. Today at 7:30 p.m., tomorrow at 2 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083 or (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $23; $20 for the elderly; $15 for students (Kozinn).     CONTINUUM. This ensemble presents a portrait of the Puerto Rican composer Roberto Sierra, whose music combines vivid Caribbean rhythms and colors with tricks he learned from new music as a pupil of (and influence on) Gyorgy Ligeti. There are new pieces -- ''Tema y Variaciones'' for clarinet and piano, ''Cancionero Sefardi'' for soprano and instruments -- as well as music tracking the composer back to the mid-80's. Tomorrow night at 8:30, Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330. Tickets: $15, students and the elderly, $7.50 (Griffiths).     KELLER QUARTET. Formed in the 1980's at the Budapest Academy, one of the finest schools for chamber music, this is an exceptional quartet. The strong program begins with one of the quartets Mozart dedicated to Haydn (K. 387), goes on to Bartok's strangest and loveliest quartet (his second) and ends with Schubert's ''Death and the Maiden,'' a work close to these musicians' hearts and the subject of one of their first, thrilling recordings. Tonight at 8, Weill Recital Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $36 (Griffiths).     TON KOOPMAN. Unlike the other pillar of Lincoln Center's Bach commemoration, Andras Schiff, who did one thing -- played Bach suites on the piano -- supremely well, Mr. Koopman is all over the map. But here, simply as organist, he is on firmer ground than in his reconstruction of the ''St. Mark Passion'' with the Amsterdam Baroque, listed above. He offers an interesting mix of Bach works, including several great chorale preludes, on the excellent Mander organ at an Upper East Side church that Lincoln Center's Great Performers series has happily annexed. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $30 (Oestreich).     NEW YORK CHAMBER SYMPHONY. Itzhak Perlman is a ubiquitous presence in New York as a violinist. On Sunday he makes what is essentially his New York conducting debut. He has occasionally conducted a work here and there on a particular program when he is performing as a violin soloist, but this time he conducts an entire all-Beethoven program himself. He offers two works: the Triple Concerto, with the Perlman Nikkanen Bailey Trio (that's Navah Perlman) as soloists, and the Seventh Symphony. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $35 and $50 (Tommasini).     NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. Some of Kurt Masur's more memorable achievements as music director of the orchestra have come in the big choral works of Bach. Here, with the American Boychoir and men of the Westminster Symphonic Choir, Mr. Masur arrives at the St. John Passion, a vivid setting from the Gospel of John. Perhaps too vivid in taking up John's accusations against Jews, but the score's best moments remain eloquent and edifying. The veteran Peter Schreier is the Evangelist, and the other vocal soloists include Hakan Hagegard, Heidi Grant Murphy and Marietta Simpson. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $26 to $92 (Oestreich).     SEQUENTIA. The first good news is the mere survival of this superb early-music group, in its first visit to New York since the death of its co-founder Barbara Thornton in 1998. Here it is represented by its male contingent, Sons of Thunder, directed by the other founder, Benjamin Bagby, but the female contingent also remains active. The program, ''Pilgrims to the Apocalypse,'' includes works by Hildegard von Bingen and other music from the 10th through 13th centuries. Tonight at 8, St. Jean Baptiste Church, Lexington Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 570-2130. Tickets: $25 and $30 (Oestreich).    Dance    LES BALLETS GRANDIVA. That madcap ballet choreographer Peter Anastos is back, and Victor Trevino, a male ballerina who also choreographs, has got him. The program, which stars ballet luminaries like Suzanne Farewell, Sylvie Gruyere and Lotte Latte, includes spoofs of dance by George Balanchine, William Forsythe and Marius Petipa. Sunday night at 7, Pace Downtown Theater, 3 Spruce Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 346-1715. Tickets: $25; $20 for students, the elderly and dancers (Jennifer Dunning).     BALLET TECH. Eliot Feld's high-energy ballet troupe bounds through its spring season with a large repertory that includes the premieres of Mr. Feld's ''Coup de Couperin,'' to the Baroque music of Francois Couperin, and ''Nodrog Doggo,'' to a score by Michael Gordon. (Hint: spell the first word of that odd title backward.) Among the many revivals are five works with music by Steve Reich. Damian Woetzel of the New York City Ballet is appearing as guest artist in all performances of Mr. Feld's ''Mending.'' Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at noon and 4 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: Evenings and at 4 p.m. Sunday, $35; tomorrow at 2 p.m. and Sunday at noon, $25 adults, $15 children, (Jack Anderson).     JEFFREY BAUER.

Tickets: $10; $8 students and the elderly; TDF vouchers accepted (Dunning).     SIGAL BERGMAN. This charming Israeli-born dancer, who seems alive to every moment on the stage, will present ''Circuit,'' a piece that examines a newcomer's perception of postmodern dance in New York City. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Washington Square United Methodist Church, 133 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 802-9136. Tickets: $15; $12 for students and low-income audiences (Dunning).     BROOKLYN ARTS EXCHANGE: FIRST WEEKENDS. This program of performance and discussion features Aaron Landsman's new ''No Place Like Home,'' set in an anonymous office, and Jon Kinzel's new ''Stop Ahead,'' dance with video about Prospect Park. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday night at 6, Brooklyn Arts Exchange, 421 Fifth Avenue, at Eighth Street, Park Slope; (718) 832-0018. Tickets: $12; $6 for low-income audiences (Dunning).     JESUS CANO AND LISA BOTTALICO. Dance soloists and a group of musicians pay tribute to Antonio, one of the greatest Spanish dancers of the 20th century. In addition to traditional Flamenco, the program includes music by Manuel de Falla, whose scores were used by Antonio, and there will be a guest appearance by Eva Lucena, director of the Alborada Spanish Dance Theater. Sunday night at 7, Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $20; $10 for children and students (Anderson).     COMPANY APPELS. With paintings by Chuck Close as a backdrop, the Company Appels will perform new solos and duets by Jonathon Appels. Tonight at 8, PaceWildenstein Gallery, 142 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 355-4172. Tickets: $15; $12 for students and the elderly (Dunning).     TINA CROLL AND JAMES CUNNINGHAM: ''THE HORSE'S MOUTH.'' One of the most heartwarming and revealing recurring dance events is back in town. Tina Croll and James Cunningham are eloquent performers and choreographers who have witnessed several decades of downtown dance history in New York. In their cannily assembled ''Horse's Mouth'' series, that history and more comes radiantly alive through the bodies, minds and memories of those who lived it. This weekend's performers include Grover Dale, Stuart Hodes, Yvonne Rainer, Sara Rudner and Gus Solomons Jr. Today and Sunday at 8:30 p.m.; tomorrow at 3 and 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15; TDF vouchers accepted (Dunning).     EIFMAN BALLET OF ST. PETERSBURG. Boris Eifman, one of Russia's most controversial choreographers, has returned to New York with a repertory reflecting his love of strong dramatic passions. This week's attraction is ''Red Giselle,'' a hallucinatory dance-drama based on the life of Olga Spessivtseva, a Russian ballerina who fled the Soviet Union in 1923 and whose career was eventually cut short by mental illness. Today at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212. Tickets: $30 to $55 (Anderson).     FLAMENCO EXTRAVAGANZA. The cast may change from performance to performance, depending on which guest artists turn up at this intimate club to sing, dance or play flamenco guitar. But the star of the evening is Carmen La Sala, featured with performers like La Conja, Paco Ortiz and Juan Amaya. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30; ''Scheherazade's Tales,'' an evening of belly dancing, may be seen on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. Theater East, 211 East 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 838-9090. Tickets: $25 for the flamenco program; $15 for ''Scheherazade's Tales'' (Dunning).     MAIA CLAIRE GARRISON/M'ZAWA DANZ.  The three-part ''Panther Peace'' contrasts human aggressiveness with our desire for peace, and the dance's inspirations range from the political ideas of the Black Panthers to the teachings of the Dalai Lama. Tomorrow night at 8; Sunday afternoon at 5, Playhouse 91, 316 East 91st Street, Yorkville, (212) 415-5553 (tomorrow) and (212) 996-1100 (Sunday). Tickets: $15 (Anderson).     SCOTT HERON. For ''The Water,'' a fantastic meditation on urban and rural life, areas of the stage become an interactive sound sculpture and a magic forest of wigs and heads. The characters include a Kabuki drag queen, a sobbing clown, a rope walker, a country singer and a tap-dancing little girl. Tonight through Sunday night at 8:30, Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288. Tickets: $15 (Anderson).     GABRIELLE LANSNER. A director and choreographer, Gabrielle Lansner approaches dance through drama, telling stories that explore the human heart with humor, poignancy and intelligence. Her ''Crush'' is about infatuation. ''Man Suit(e)'' is about male and female stereotypes, with quotations from ''Extracts from Adam's Diary'' and ''Eve's Diary,'' by Mark Twain. Tonight through Sunday night and Tuesday night at 8; April 16 at 3 p.m. Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 647-0202.  Tickets: $15 (tonight through Sunday); $12 (weekdays) (Dunning).     SARAH MICHELSON AND JULIE ATLAS MUZ. Soaking wet, the downtowners Sarah Michelson and Julie Atlas Muz will ''jump off a ledge,'' the advance publicity says, into the possibly murky waters of demolition, death without rebirth, high-caloric intake and makeovers. Thursday through Saturday nights through April 22 at 8, Dixon Place at Vineyard 26, 309 East 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 532-1546 Tickets: $12; $8 students and the elderly; TDF vouchers accepted (Dunning).

CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE GUIDE"},{"year":"2000","title":"Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.    Opera     ''MARRIAGE OF FIGARO.'' The homespun but attractive qualities of the Amato Opera's productions and the intimacy of its shoe-box theater offer a useful change of perspective for operagoers used to the big houses uptown. The casts here vary: at the very least, the singers are eager and enthusiastic","excerpt":"sometimes the singing shows great promise. And Anthony Amato, the company's founder, conducts the performances with an evident love of the music. The closing production of the company's season is Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' performed in English. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village; (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $25; $20 for the elderly and children (Allan Kozinn).    Classical     BARGEMUSIC. There are few better places in the city to hear chamber music than this barge floating on the East River, with its live, intimate acoustics and its spectacular view of Lower Manhattan. Good weather will only enhance the experience, and the performances are often as fine as the setting. Here, in programs coordinated by Paul Neubauer, an excellent violist, he is joined by other fine performers, including the McDermott sisters. (Kerry, a violinist, and Anne-Marie, a pianist, perform tonight and are joined tomorrow and on Sunday by Maureen, a cellist.) The big piece tonight is Brahms's great Piano Quintet. Tomorrow and on Sunday, Robert White, a tenor, performs songs of Beethoven. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, and Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $23; $20 for the elderly; $15 for students (James R. Oestreich).     BRONX ARTS ENSEMBLE. Carlos Franzetti conducts an orchestra in an annual holiday program in a tent on Sunday at 2 p.m. . The program includes seasoned Americana by Copland (''An Outdoor Overture'' and music from ''Appalachian Spring'' and ''Rodeo'') and Howard Hanson (''Romantic'' Symphony) as well as Mr. Franzetti's own Sinfonia from ''Corpus Evita.'' Woodlawn Cemetery, Jerome and Bainbridge Avenues, the Bronx, (718) 601-7399. Free (Oestreich).     ELEMENTS STRING QUARTET. The group, founded last year, is new to this listener, but the program, centering on the fugue, is attractively varied. Inevitably, Beethoven's ''Grosse Fugue'' is here. So are Mendelssohn's A minor Quartet (Op. 13) and Bartok's Third, along with a suite of movements by Glazunov and Rimsky-Korsakov. Tomorrow night at 8, Grace and St. Paul's Church, 123 West 71st Street, Manhattan, (212) 904-1422, Extension 13. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).     PAUL JACOBS. Students are naturally exuberant when they finally graduate, but this beats all. The day after his graduation from the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia two weeks ago, this young organist began a series of the complete Bach organ works, unfolding over 14 consecutive evenings. Here he presents the last two programs, both mingling chorale preludes with more formally based works, like the great C minor Passacaglia and Fugue (BWV 562), which ends the series tomorrow. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (212) 288-8920, Extension 267. Admission: suggested donation of $10; $8 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).     MIDAMERICA PRODUCTIONS. This group's presentations could most kindly be called mixed. This concert is typical in bringing together choruses of no obvious distinction from around the country. But the program may be of more than usual interest, combining Schubert's G major Mass (D. 167) with David Fanshawe's ''African Sanctus,'' a 1972 setting of the Mass incorporating African music. Not knowing Mr. Fanshawe's work or the motley performers, one cannot promise more. Sunday night at 8:30, Carnegie Hall; (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $16 to $68 (Oestreich).     NEW VIENNA CHAMBER ENSEMBLE. This Austrian group, consisting of a soprano (Joan-Marie Zimmerman) and seven instrumentalists, now two years old, has yet to be heard, so a reasonable level of quality can only be assumed. But it must be said, at least, that the ensemble is adventurous in its programming, juxtaposing composers based in Vienna (from Schubert to the present of Dieter Kaufmann and others) with counterparts based more or less in New York (George Perle, Donald Martino, Perry Goldstein and Edward Smaldone). Tonight at 8, Christ and St. Stephen's Church, 120 West 69th Street, Manhattan, (212) 568-4732. Tickets: $12; $8 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).     NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. The New York Philharmonic is winding down its subscription year with a program including the Shostakovich Seventh Symphony and the premiere of Lowell Liebermann's Trumpet Concerto. The Philharmonic's estimable Philip Smith plays the trumpet solos, and Kurt Masur conducts. Avery Fisher Hall, Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; (212) 721-6500. Tickets, $18 to $77. (Bernard Holland).     NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY. Mischa Santora conducts the young players of the New York Youth Symphony in Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola, Stravinsky's ''Petrushka'' Suite and a new piece by Gregory Spears called ''Midnight Pictures.'' Pamela Frank and Andy Simionescu are the soloists. Carnegie Hall, Sunday at 2 p.m.; (212) 247-7800. Tickets, $7 to $40 (Holland).    Dance     AMERICAN BALLET THEATER. Kenneth MacMillan's ''Romeo and Juliet'' lumbers in this weekend in all its lavishly appointed sets and costumes. The star-crossed pair will be performed by Julie Kent and Vladimir Malakhov tonight, Yan Chen and Angel Corella tomorrow afternoon and Ashley Tuttle and the redoubtable Mr. Corella tomorrow night. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Metropolitan Opera House; (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $20 to $75 (Jennifer Dunning).     CHRISTOPHER CAINES DANCERS AND SINGERS. Christopher Caines is not simply a choreographer but also a composer and, this program suggests, a cultural historian. His new evening-long ''Arias'' is a suite of dances inspired in part by the lyrical early European modern dance of the Art Nouveau era as captured in the dance photography of Paul Jsenfels in Germany in the 1920's. ''Arias'' is set to songs by 10 composers including Handel, Faure, Schoenberg, Scarlatti and Gershwin. Tomorrow and Sunday night at 8. Construction Company, 10 East 18th Street, Manhattan; (212) 924-7882. Tickets: $12; $10 for students and the elderly; T.D.F. vouchers accepted (Dunning).     WALLY CARDONA QUARTET. Wally Cardona provides audiences with a sneak preview of ''Trance Territory,'' a work in progress. Described as ''a tribal ritual for the 21st century,'' it combines ancient rites with modern technology to affirm dance and music as transcendent spiritual experiences. The program also includes Mr. Cardona's ''Open House 01: Prime.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Street Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $12;TDF vouchers accepted (Jack Anderson).     ANN CARLSON. A choreographer noted for her unusual use of spaces turns the entire Chelsea neighborhood into an outdoor stage in her ''Night Light.'' History collides with contemporary life as audiences are taken on a walking tour through the area, pausing in gardens, back alleys, churches and apartments while dancers enact scenes from Chelsea's past; the evening ends at the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Reservations and information about meeting points: (212) 255-5793, extension 11. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and Chelsea residents. (Anderson).     KATHLEEN FLYNN AND ALISON BELINFANTE. In this interestingly balanced program by two newish modern-dance choreographers, Kathleen Flynn will address the life and dreams of modern working women in three dances, one inspired by the iconic Rosie the Riveter, and Alison Belinfante will explore bizarre aspects of the circus in six dances that make use of a shared corset, balloon-concealing hoop skirts, a tightwire and crinolines. Tonight through Sunday night at 8. Context Studios, 28 Avenue A between Second and Third Streets, East Village; (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $12 (Dunning).     THE KITCHEN: DANCE IN PROGRESS. This annual series brings newish and mid-career choreographers together for two months to create dances in a workshop atmosphere. This year's choreographers and works are Amy Cox and ''Waterfront,'' inspired by the Williamsburg waterfront; Andrea Kleine and an excerpt from a dance about identity and the photographic image; Amiel Malale and his minimalist ''Touch First,'' which explores  time's passing and life's surprises; and Meg Wolfe in a solo that uses movement and video to explore the externalization of personality. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-5793, extension 11. Tickets: $12 (Dunning).     NEW YORK CITY BALLET. It was something of a blessing when the New York City Ballet paid tribute to the fledgling Dance Theater of Harlem in 1971. Today the company -- founded by the charismatic City Ballet dancer Arthur Mitchell after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to prove that blacks could dance ballet -- is a force to be reckoned with. Tomorrow night and Sunday, City Ballet pays tribute again, on Dance Theater of Harlem's 30th anniversary, with performances of ballets associated with Mr. Mitchell's career there, and a new piece choreographed by Robert Garland and Robert LaFosse, who were nurtured by the two companies. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. . New York State Theater; (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $72; $10 for student rush tickets (Dunning).     TAMI STRONACH DANCE. A dancer with Neta Pulvermacher, Tami Stronach will present her own choreography, performed by dancers known for their work with Stephen Petronio, Bebe Miller, Urban Bush Women and Doug Varone. Ms. Stronach will present ''Love Particles'' and the intriguing-sounding ''Two Inch Pedestal,'' a solo about the impossibility of becoming the ideal girl. Sharing the program will be the guest troupes the Flying Machine and the Underfoot Dance Company. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Washington Square Methodist Church, 133 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village; (718) 384-1377. Tickets: $12; $10 for students and the elderly (Dunning).     TANGO AND TANGO. Need one say more?

Tickets: $20; $18 for students, children and the elderly (Dunning).     TAP EXTRAVAGANZA 2000. An event that lives up to its name, Tap Extravaganza 2000 will celebrate National Tap Dance Day with performances by artists including Mable Lee, the Silver Belles, Jimmy Slyde and Dianne Walker. Flo-Bert Awards for tap artistry will be presented to Buster Brown, Savion Glover and Leonard Reed. The master of ceremonies is Ted Levy.

So here they are, in chronological order of composition:   Handel's ''Julius Caesar'' (Angel DSC-3974, three LP's). Handel was a German-born composer, all right, but he epitomized the cosmopolitanism of the 18th century. Italian-trained, he wrote ''Giulio Cesare'' at the high point of his career as an English opera composer.   This release is titled ''Julius Caesar'' because it is sung in rather stiff English and is very much a memento of the English National Opera's 1979 production, starring Janet Baker in the title role. As such, it will appeal most to those who saw the production or dote on Miss Baker. For the rest of us, the language makes little sense for a recording; the score is cut to ribbons, and Charles Mackerras's reasonably buoyant conducting seems neither ''authentic'' nor dramatic.

By far the most interesting option so far, one that began to be news a few years ago and has increased its visibility since, is the work of miniature subcultures known as collectives.

One way or another, joint production among parties of equal standing -- we're not talking about master artist and studio assistants here -- scrambles existing aesthetic formulas. It may undermine the cult of the artist as media star, dislodge the supremacy of the precious object and unsettle the economic structures that make the art world a mirror image of the inequities of American culture at large. In short, it confuses how we think about art and assign value to it. This can only be good.      Consider, for example, the work of a collective with the name 0100101110101101.ORG. It consists of two young Spanish artists, Eva and Franco Mattes, who call their art ''media actionism.''

But to those of us who actually live there, the Lake District is not just a collection of views, however famous. It is a place that has been lived and worked in for 2,000 years - a place of crags and scree, woods and marshes, buzzards and sheep. Above all, it is a lump of rock.\\n\\nIt is the rock which gives the region a variety far greater than that of any area of comparable size in Britain. First, there is the shape of the rock, a dome down which the rivers have carved out dales that radiate, as Wordsworth said, like the spokes of a wheel. Secondly, most of the Lake District is made up of the lavas and cinders spewn out by ancient volcanoes, and as these varied enormously in substance, so the rocks vary in hardness.

It can sometimes be an event as surprising as opening a page and listening to a product that sings. Otherwise, it is more mundane -- there is a tab to pull or a surface to scratch.    Chrysler's latest print ad for its mini-van requires the reader to rip away some extraneous paper and fumble with a tab that in some cases must be tugged again and again before it will reveal its secret.   When the tab is pulled a picture of the exterior of the van splits to show a close-up of the van's interior. But the effort it can take to get at the visual punch line can be as frustrating as opening childproof caps on medicine.    The ad, which was created by Bozell, will appear in the Dec. 17 issue of Time magazine.    \\"The purpose of the ad is to reflect the overwhelming amount of investment that went into updating the mini-van,\\" said Larry DoBrow, a spokesman at Bozell. \\"This way we get the reader to participate and make them much more aware of the focus of the changes.\\" Chrysler's New Effort For Involving Readers"},{"year":"1994","title":"IN \\"IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU,\\" a police officer named Charlie (Nicolas Cage) stares deeply into the eyes of a waitress named Yvonne (Bridget Fonda) with the  conviction of a man who has just tuned in to the frequency of true love.

Mr. Benton's crew spent three weeks filming the effects of a tornado that is seen only peripherally in ''Places in the Heart,'' since their attempts to use a special-effects twister never looked convincing. Instead, the emphasis was on sound effects and on careful editing. ''We imagine a lot that we don't actually see,'' Mr. Benton said. As for what    is    seen, wind machines and trick windows conspired to blow out panes, and the film stock was desaturated to make it greener and darker.

A1    Spy Case Questions  The exoneration of a German career intelligence official accused of spying for Russia has not ended a controversy surrounding the matter in either Germany or the United States, where the case has raised new questions at the C.I.A. about the possible betrayal of American secrets.   A1    Russia's Bond Sale Successful  Russia's unsteady economy survived a critical test as the Government sold nearly $1 billion in Treasury bills without paying the colossal interest rates at which the bonds traded just a week ago.   A1    Report of Catholic Complicity  A State Department report says Roman Catholic priests in Rome helped Croatian leaders, who sent as many as 700,000 Serbs, Jews and others to death camps during World War II, hide in Italy after the war and later flee to South America.   A9    Albania Issues an Alarm  The Albanian Government said there were signs indicating that the Serbian army might be preparing to enter Albania to hunt separatist rebels from Kosovo Province, in Serbia.   A12    Fighting on Ethiopian Border  Heavy fighting was reported to have broken out between Ethiopian and Eritrean troops along the border, dealing a serious blow to diplomatic efforts to avert a full-scale war between the former allies.   A13    Mexico to Charge U.S. Agents  Mexico told the United States that it would prosecute American Customs agents and informers who carried out an undercover money-laundering operation on Mexican soil, and that it would seek the agents' extradition to face criminal trial in Mexico City.   A5    Rewards for Political Killings  Eugene de Kock, one of the apartheid era's most notorious killers, testified that he received medals and was congratulated by generals and at least one Cabinet minister for his work in killing political opponents. The former police colonel appeared in the contempt trial of P. W. Botha, the former President who said he never sanctioned such activities.   A11    China Trade Status Renewal  President Clinton announced that he would renew China's trading privileges, signaling that he would not back away from his policy of engagement despite the rising controversy over his China dealings.   A10    Jakarta Students Protest  Students in Jakarta turned out in force in motorcades of buses and cars to demand, in the happiest manner possible, the downfall of the Government.   A10    NATIONAL   A14-25    AIDS Vaccine Approved For Full-Scale Testing  The Food and Drug Administration gave a California company, Vaxgen, approval to conduct the world's first full-scale test of a vaccine to prevent infection with the virus that causes AIDS. The tests will seek to determine how effective the vaccine can be in protecting people exposed to H.I.V. because of high-risk sexual practices or drug use.   A1    Treatment for Hepatitis C  The F.D.A. approved the use of two antiviral drugs in the combination known as Rebetron to treat chronic hepatitis C, a liver infection that can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure.   A14    The Outcome in California  Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis of California, a Democrat, and State Attorney General Dan Lungren, a Republican, won their parties' primaries for governor on Tuesday.   A1    Voters passed Proposition 227, which would curtail three decades of bilingual instruction. Opponents filed suit in Federal District Court in San Francisco to prevent the resolution from taking effect.   A25    Voters rejected Proposition 226, which would have required unions to obtain written consent from members before using their dues for political purposes.   A24    Jerry Brown, a former Governor of California, captured enough votes against 10 opponents in the Oakland mayoral primary to avoid a runoff in November. He will take office in January.   A24    Terrorism Suspect in Custody  Mohammed Rashid, who Federal officials say is one of the Middle East's most dangerous terrorists, has been brought to the United States to face charges in a 1982 airline bombing that killed a Japanese youth.   A18    New Guidelines on Obesity  The Federal Government is reducing its threshold for defining who is overweight, using new guidelines under which about 55 percent of the population will be considered too fat, according to a Federal institute. The guidelines, to be issued this month, use body mass index, a calculation of body weight in relation to height.   A22    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-8    Appeals Court Upholds Sex-Shop Zoning Law  A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unanimously upheld a city zoning law intended to curtail and isolate X-rated businesses. But under Federal court rules the decision does not become official for up to 21 days, meaning the city must delay enforcement. Sex-shop owners said they would ask the full court to take up the issue.   B1    Altering a Position on Parole  Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, reversing his position, said he would agree to end discretionary parole for violent felons.   B1    Vendors Protest New Rules  Hundreds of sidewalk food vendors shut down their carts and paraded through lower Manhattan to protest Mayor Giuliani's plan to restrict street sales.   B3    Death Penalty Deliberations  A jury in Brooklyn began deliberating whether to sentence a former jail guard to execution for murdering three people during a robbery, in the first death penalty trial under New York State's three-year-old capital punishment law.   B3    Shortage of Lifeguards  City officials said they were facing a shortage of lifeguards for the city's seven beaches and 55 outdoor pools, causing large sections of beachfront to stay closed.   B5    SPORTS   C1-8    A Debut at Yankee Stadium  Orlando Hernandez, who fled Cuba by sea six months ago, made his debut as a Yankee pitcher, going seven strong innings and defeating Tampa Bay, 7-1.   A1    ARTS   E1-12    Sculptor Quits Project in Berlin  The American sculptor Richard Serra withdrew from a project to design a Holocaust memorial in Berlin, citing ''personal and professional reasons'' that ''had nothing to do with the merits of the project.''   E1    BUSINESS DAY   D1-20    Privacy on the Internet  The F.T.C. is expected to censure the Internet industry today in a report to Congress that says virtually nothing has been done to insure consumer privacy protection on line.   D1    Surging Car and Truck Sales  The nation's auto industry reported May was the best month for car and truck sales since September 1986, with sales totaling more than 1.5 million cars and trucks, a 12.1 percent increase from May 1997.   D1    Korean Air Set to Buy New Jets  Korean Air intends to announce next week that it will buy 27 new Boeing 737 passenger jets, an order valued at $1.35 billion.

Nowadays the city seems to have a greater number of illiberal polemicists on union-dead newspapers than it does labor organizers. Which only makes more encouraging the arrival of Francisco Chang upon Gotham's fabric heart in the mid-Manhattan garment district.   He is a 28-year-old, Korean-born, Spanish-speaking sweatshop organizer in behalf of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and its new experimental strategy of shop-by-shop confidence building instead of confrontational, hit-the-bricks tactics of the past generations of Eastern European sweatshop workers. This means Mr. Chang, speaking in Korean to the newer owners and Spanish to the newer workers, tends to respond in quiet ombudsman fashion to the specific shop complaints about lost wages, denied overtime pay and missing fringe benefits that have long been the bane of each immigrant wave of sweatshop workers as they tend toward meekness in their new land.
