And no better recent demonstration of the veteran French comedian's mighty skill can be had than his work in \\"The Sheep Has Five Legs,\\" which opened at the Fine Arts yesterday.Run up the glittering Tricolor and bang out the \\"Marseillaise\\"! Remember \\"The Well-Digger's Daughter,\\" \\"Harvest\\" and \\"Un Carnet de Bal\\"! For not only is this latest picture the best with Fernandel in years, but it is probably the cleverest and most hilarious French comedy we've seen since the war.That is a heap of commendation to be loading on one brazen film that bears such an outragious title and has its star playing six delicious roles. But it merits every clanging syllable of it, right down to the last unpleasant word. This reviewer is still laughing fondly at the fantastic humors it unfolds.Let's give a lot of credit for it to the stable of writers who contrived the collection of individual fables that make up the whole elaborate yarn. The series of tied-together stories of an old French vintner and his quintuplet sons who are assembled from the four corners of the earth for a family reunion are vignettes of bright conceit and charm. They are, indeed, the imaginings of unrestrained Gallic minds, tickled by quick-witted ideas and a lively inclination to have fun.Let's credit, too. Henri Verneuil, who directed the whole thing in a style of nimble pictorial suggestion and sly, sometimes slightly bawdy farce.But, certainly, the major share of credit for the crackle and snap in this film should go to Fernandel, whose talent for drawing comic characters is superb. Not one of the six assorted fellows—the father and his quintuplet sons—that he plays is like the others except in facial contour. And each has his own amusing mood.The old man is crabby and explosive, outraged and unforgiving toward his sons who have not come back to see him since they were taken away as \\"national monuments\\" to thestate when infants. One son, a beauty parlor operator, is pompous and full of prissy airs. Another, a vagrant sea-captain, is darkly tempestuous and dour. The long scene in which this fellow plays a sort of roulette, with a fly as the critical determinant of fortune, is the funniest in the film. Charlie Chaplin's pantomimic exhibitions were seldom better than Fernandel's in this scene.Another son is a soft-hearted \\"lonely hearts\\" columnist","excerpt":"another a village curé who has become a laughing stock in his town because he bears a strong resemblance to a famous movie star in a famous role. Yet another is a poor but happy family man whose life is shadowed by a greedy undertaker. The story of this last oppressed quintuplet is the most ambitious and intellectually droll. Fernandel's display of hypochondria under the spell of the undertaker is a scream. And his glee at discovering freedom when the undertaker dies first is a joy.Others support the star expertly. De Funes as the slick undertaker and Delmont as the grown-up quints' godfather who gathers them together are particularly droll. But the picture is carried by Fernandel, who works harder than the rest of the cast rolled into one. We hope he was paid six salaries for this picture. He certainly earns them, every one.Also on the bill at the Fine Arts is the two-reel prize-winning film, \\"A Time Out of War,\\" which sensitively pictures a poignant episode between Union and Confederate pickets in the Civil War. It is a keen and eloquent little picture, but somewhat misplaced on this bill.

(Perennial/HarperCollins, $20.) In canvassing the great works of the Western mind over the last 500 years, the eminent French-born scholar creates an iconoclastic gallery of profiles ranging from Mozart to Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., reserving his gloomiest assessments for the achievements of the 20th century. Last year in the Book Review, William R. Everdell called this ''a great achievement'' that ''will surely survive to provoke and delight readers of the 21st century.''    NO GREAT MISCHIEF, by Alistair MacLeod. (Vintage International, $13.) Set among the Scottish fishermen of Cape Breton and their displaced heirs, this novel is about a Canadian orthodontist who lives in a tumult of longing and memory linked to his clan's long history. ''MacLeod's lyricism succeeds in leaving a reader both harrowed by and envious of all the sorrow, violence and ravenous love demanded by the . . . family bloodlines,'' Thomas Mallon wrote in the Book Review in 2000.    DOUBLE DOWN: Reflections on Gambling and Loss, by Frederick Barthelme and Steven Barthelme. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) Two brothers, both fiction writers who teach at the University of Southern Mississippi, tell how they gambled away more than $300,000 on a two-year spree following the death of their parents. Not only did they squander their inheritance, but they were also indicted for cheating. Their ordeal is chronicled ''in a style so seamless that it's hard to tell you are reading a collaboration'' Robert R. Harris said here in 1999. Frederick Barthelme's novel Tracer (Counterpoint, $13) offers up a slice of life in tacky 1980's Florida, following the fortunes of a man who escapes his divorce proceedings by taking up with his sister-in-law at a Gulf Coast hotel, only to have his soon-to-be ex show up for a visit. Even if the zaniness occasionally falls flat, ''Barthelme is a gifted writer'' whose ''ear for dialogue is nearly impeccable,'' Susan M. Dodd wrote here in 1985.    FIVE SISTERS: The Langhornes of Virginia, by James Fox. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $16.) This group biography of the dazzling Langhorne sisters by one of their grandsons tells of how they bloomed from the Old South, a myth created by the Old North out of post-Reconstruction guilt, to become archetypal Southern belles. One of them received 63 marriage proposals","excerpt":"another bagged an Astor and became Britain's first female member of Parliament. Fox spins the tale ''clearheadedly, prying life from artifice,'' Stacy Schiff wrote here last year. At its best, his account ''reads like 'Pride and Prejudice' as recast by Margaret Mitchell.''    MANSERVANT AND MAIDSERVANT, by Ivy Compton-Burnett. (New York Review, $12.95.) Nothing much happens to the seedy country gentry and their knowing butler in this postwar British novel, originally published as ''Bullivant and the Lambs,'' even though fantasies of murder and adultery are entertained from time to time. ''Yet Compton-Burnett gives their existence point and depth and luster,'' Charles Poore wrote here in 1948. ''She does that by concentrating on the drama that lies in commonplace, everyday things.''    PASTORALIA: Stories, by George Saunders. (Riverhead, $12.) These unsentimental tales of misfits, losers and have-nots explore Americans' (mostly futile) urge for self-improvement, dread of failure and need to be accepted, not to mention the pathetic contradictions that underlie the ruthless drive for success. ''Saunders's exuberantly weird stories'' display ''an abundance of ideas, meanings and psychological nuance,'' Lynne Tillman wrote in these pages in 2000. He ''can be brutally funny.''    HALF A HEART, by Rosellen Brown. (Picador USA, $14.) This novel's heroine is a prosperous white housewife and former civil rights activist who tries to track down the biracial daughter she deserted 20 years earlier. '' 'Half a Heart' is genuinely powerful, partly because Brown is a fine writer . . . and partly because the reunion at its core is about much more than a mother and a daughter,'' Laura Shapiro wrote here in 2000.    REPUBLIC OF DENIAL: Press, Politics, and Public Life, by Michael Janeway. (Yale University, $12.95.) In examining what he sees as the sorry state of journalism and politics, the author argues that just as the public has lost faith in government and progress, it has also lost faith in the news media, in part because of its weak response to wider cultural forces. ''Janeway clearly has the gift of synthesis,'' Jeff Greenfield said here in 1999.   Scott Veale   NEW & NOTEWORTHY PAPERBACKS"},{"year":"1954","title":"WEST BABYLON, L.

Anna is another benighted beauty, who, like Susan Lenox and Madelon Claudet, takes to the broad highway, but she at least has the satisfaction of being no object for tears. For she retains her beauty to the final fade-out and is not at all depressed at having her male friends interested enough in her welfare to shower jewels and money on her.Love is mentioned frequently in this picture, but one gathers that although the characters are in an upper stratum of life they know no more about it than the ten-year soldier's housemaids of \\"Mandalay.\\" At one point in this narrative, James Fenwick, who has reason to believe that Anna has been killed in the wreck of a train bound for the Riviera, mumbles \\"Anna\\" in a distressed snooze, but when Anna turns up alive, he is soon having heated words with her.This tale begins before the war and ends in this year of grace. Time deals quite lightly with the persons involved and Miss Chatterton, instead of becoming gray, is transformed into a dazzling blonde. She handles her Russian-English accent with marked ability and her acting is good, Anna is a somewhat tactless person, for just after she has married. Fenwick and is introduced to his smug English people, she shocks them by saying that she expects soon, to become a mother.Then the war intervenes and after it Fenwick is more interested in politics than he is in his wife. He is a very strange young man and so are his parents. Anna's little girl grows up in care of the Fenwicks and when she is about 18 she encounters the same unsympathetic treatment her father had shown to her mother. This girl, Faith, is saved by her mother from a serious flirtation and in the end Anna, backed by the power of a substantial bank account, delivers an ultimatum to Fenwick, who by that time has divorced her and married an English woman. How he obtained a divorce is rather vague.The dialogue often is stilted and awkward. When Anna sends for Fenwick to discuss her daughter's marriage to a respectable Beaux Arts student, the first remark of the ex-husband, who has not seen her for years, is:\\"Won't you have a seat?\\"Characters in motion pictures are constantly having this line put into their mouths, when one imagines they should be thinking of something far more interesting.Geoffrey Kerr plays Fenwick, and he does as well as possible with the part. Miss Chatterton is always most pleasing to look upon, and she enhances her charm by her speech in this adventure. Hence, like several recent productions, this film can boast of its performers and feel rather sorry for the dialogue, which is credited to Zoë Akins and Samuel Hoffenstein.Guthrie McClintic's direction is, on the whole, efficient, but considering his theatrical affiliations, it is surprising that he could, not persuade the adapters to blue-pencil many of their lines and substitute something more human.The chief attraction in the flesh-and-blood line is Bing Crosby, who croons several of his ballads. The hosts who like his peculiar style may be glad to know that he will be at the Paramount for a second week. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Another Benighted Beauty. Blighted Ambitions.

Frank Baum's classic, \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\\" it is an ebullient family crowd-pleaser. And a new production at the Beacon Theater, directed by George Faison and starring Stephanie Mills and Andre De Shields from the original Broadway cast, demonstrates that it doesn't take much to refresh the show, which ran on Broadway for four years. All that's needed is an infusion of contemporary slang and choreography (including a little Michael Jackson moonwalking and sexy L. L. Cool J-style pushups) to bring it up to date.   \\"The Wiz\\" takes a story so familiar that it doesn't have to be meticulously told to be followed, and reconceives it as a modern vaudeville entertainment with a pop-gospel score. The show is much jollier in tone than the movie \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" which conveyed deep currents of Depression-era anxiety and longing for better times. Stephanie Mills's Dorothy has more pluck and brass than Judy Garland's waifish prairie dreamer. And while Ms. Mills's traveling companions on the Yellow Brick Road bemoan their lack of brains, heart and courage, the show's Scarecrow, Tinman and Lion are not so poignantly bereft of self-confidence as their movie counterparts.

But what is lacking is an army of teachers trained to fight the battle for reforms.   The nation's major universities, by largely abandoning teacher training, have done little to provide those important troops.   The research universities haven't had teacher education on their agenda,\\" J. Myron Atkin, dean of the School of Education at Stanford University, complained last week at a gathering of the deans of education of 17 leading universities.   The meeting, held at the Johnson Foundation's Wingspread Conference Center here, was called to discuss how to build up a teaching force without which all the calls for better schools will fizzle. And while the deans agreed on the need to join forces to improve teacher education, they seemed less certain about how to do it.   Although they never admitted it in so many words, they left little doubt that teacher education is in chaos. Schools of education attached to major universities today train fewer classroom teachers than in the past, and some have gone out of the teacher training business altogether. They prefer to do research, leaving the crucial task of teacher training to lesser institutions.   Research is more glamorous than service in the trenches. Dealing with bright Ph.D. candidates, as one dean admitted, is more exciting than preparing teachers for the first grade. Although there was no formal agreement on the issue, the sense of the meeting was that leading universities must once again make teacher training first in priority.     But what kind of training? The profession is seriously split. One faction would follow the medical model, with its internship and residency","excerpt":"another faction charges that such \\"apprenticeship\\" fails to imbue future teachers with fundamental philosophies of education. Most of the deans seemed to feel that reliance on apprenticeship limits the apprentice too narrowly to one model.   \\"The public needs to make the decision - do we really want somebody teaching the children who is merely an apprentice?\\" asked Robert H. Koff, dean of the school of education at the State University of New York at Albany.   Others view apprenticeship as an essential but currently missing, ingredient that should be added to, rather than replace, theoretical training. They consider current reliance on once-over-lightly student teaching insufficient to prepare future teachers for the classroom. Most new teachers face their first assignment with a sense of inadequacy, if not outright terror. Some observers critical of this way of teacher education say it is as if physicians got only their theoretical training in medical school and came face to face with real patients only after being licensed.   Despite disagreement on such crucial questions, the deans unanimously insisted on the need for solid grounding in the subjects the trainees would be teaching: teachers must know what to teach before learning how to teach it. In fact, most of these prominent educators recommended that all future high school teachers at least major in the academic subject they want to teach during their four undergraduate years. This would be followed by a one-year master's program in education.   The educators worried about a new trend: As critics of the schools, and particularly legislators, impose tough requirements for licensing teachers, local schools that are unable to find enough teachers, particularly in mathematics and science, are given waivers to permit unqualified people to teach.   This is new, but the deans find the situation getting worse. They see a rash of quick-fix retraining. \\"You go into a six-week summer course as a social studies teacher, and come out as a math teacher,\\" one of them said.    The trend is dangerous because it creates the impression that children are taught more science, mathematics or whatever other subjects the reform proposals call for; but the added subjects appear only on the students' records, not in their minds.   The deans were not overly optimistic about prospects for a dramatic rise in the number of high-ranking high school students who want to become teachers. \\"We are crazy to think we are going to get the best and the brightest,\\" said one of the educators, who did not want to be identified. \\"We need to do a better job of training that middle third from whom most of our teachers will come.\\" Until pay and conditions improve greatly, the the best students will shun teaching.   Does this mean that the schools will have to give up all hope of drawing outstanding young people into teaching? Not, said the deans, if high-quality colleges and universities refrain from abandoning their teacher training function, as some have already done or are contemplating. Instead, the deans agreed, these schools should be trying to seduce some outstanding students into teaching.   This can only happen, however, if the universities as a whole, not just their schools or departments of education, take an interest in the needs of the public schools.   What emerged was an admission that the generals would have to spend more time with their troops. Painful as it may seem to many university- based teacher education people, status-rich research may have to take a back seat to activism in the field. One dean put it bluntly: \\"We can't blame the politicians who are pushing in all directions, if we don't tell them where we want to go.\\" - ABOUT EDUCATION THE KEY TO REFORM: FINDING THE TEACHERS"},{"year":"1940","title":"2d Dem faction files Roosevelt slate in Wis SECOND ROOSEVELT SLATE","excerpt":"Another Faction of Democrats in Wisconsin Urges Draft"},{"year":"1987","title":"LEAD:         *3*** COMPANY REPORTS **    *3*WASHINGTON WATER POWER CO (NYSE)       Qtr to March 31   1987   1986                     Revenue   118,146,000   130,523,000              Net inc   19,117,000   31,584,000              Share earns   .68   1.22              The company said the decline for the latest period was caused primarily by establishment of reserve accounts for plant investment writedowns in 1986 of $53.7 million, after taxes","excerpt":"another factor contributing to the earnings decline was reduced levels of allowance for funds used during construction.

Eggs are smashed and thrown at another man. This kind of fun is far beneath anything that was done in \\"Zwei Herzen.\\" The singing, however, of Kaethe Dorsch, who impersonates the popular Annemarie, is most pleasing, even though there is occasionally in her high notes a metallic shrillness due perhaps to the recording.

One character tells in song how, now that she is pregnant, women, perfect strangers, keep asking if they can touch her stomach. It's probably safe to call that a first.

And when you have a telephone operator in love with the young man masquerading as his own servant, it only makes the story all the more interesting. The Mark Strand is offering such a picture for its thirteenth anniversary this week. It is called \\"Orchids and Ermine,\\" and in the principal roles are Jack Mulhall and Colleen Moore.Sam Hardy, who never fails to fill any part in which he appears with good sound comedy, in this case impersonates the valet, who pretends that he is the wealthy oil man. Of course there may be a number of wealthy oil men who look like Mr. Mulhall, but it is fairly safe to say that there are relatively few of them who look like Mr. Mulhall when he wears a pincenez. Mr. Mulhall never seems as if he were quite certain whether the eyeglasses were going to stay on the bridge, of his nose or bite him.As for Miss Moore she is her round-eyed brunette self. In this film story she is \\"Pink\\" Watson, a nice little voice-with-a-smile type of telephone girl, who doesn't care whether the young man she loves is Richard Tabor or Hank, the valet. As a matter of fact Hank is far more heroic in appearance than Tabor, but poor Hank has to ride with the baggage in a flivver while Tabor, when he is willing to admit his identity, sits at the wheel of an expensive roadster with \\"Pink\\" Watson beside him.So that you won't forget that the Mark Strand is thirteen years old, some short sections of ancient films are shown.

Despite the kind of clearance-sale look produced in Baldacci-Daverio's narrow front room, however, the enterprise is justified by the presence of artists largely unfamiliar in the United States, but of considerable interest.   One of them is Arturo Martini (1889-1947), whose 1928 terra-cotta \\"Torso of a Boy\\" shows only the sensuously rendered musculature of its subject's back","excerpt":"another is Pericle Fazzini (1913-1987), represented by the bronze image of a stooping youth who seems about to lift off from earth behind the gulls flying from his head.

Her life-size bronze of a fleeing woman carrying children like appendages on her body, and her image of a dead or sleeping woman's face, titled \\"Mask of Simona,\\" seem close in spirit both to the expressive use of the body in much contemporary art and to the dissolving forms of Medardo Rosso from a century ago.

Senator Lesniak and his supporters, including Assemblyman Steven Adubato, Democrat of Montclair, hope New Jersey will be able to do more than Washington to protect the public from these chemicals.

In 2008 the owner evicted tenants who had been running an informal Hughes museum there and now the only trace of him is a plaque in front of the building, which has been a landmark since 1981. The Hughes legacy may have a better chance of taking hold in Cleveland, where a nonprofit development group has bought a foreclosed house in that city’s Fairfax neighborhood, where Hughes lived for about two years starting in 1917. Hughes was in high school, living with his mother, and when she moved away he stayed on and rented an attic room at 2266 East 86th Street. According to Arnold Rampersad’s biography of Hughes, he said of his time at East 86th Street: “I couldn’t afford to eat in a restaurant, and the only thing I knew how to cook myself in the kitchen of the house where I roomed was rice, which I boiled to a paste. Rice and hot dogs, rice and hot dogs, every night for dinner. Then I read myself to sleep.” The developer, Fairfax Renaissance Development Corporation, hasn’t decided what to do with the property, which it picked up for $100 in November.

Bryant overturned the conviction of former Representative Richard Kelly, a Republican from Florida.   Judge Bryant clearly had his doubts from the start.

Before James Rosenquist and Claes Oldenburg had their first solo shows in that influential gallery, before George Segal exhibited his first plaster sculptures of the human figure there, the English-born Mr. Smith displayed these marvelous works, which helped to signal the emergence of Pop Art in America. They had titles like \\"McCalls,\\" \\"Billboard,\\" \\"Revlon\\" and \\"Chase Manhattan,\\" and their brilliant colors brought to mind the glossy illustrations in fashion magazines and the exuberance of Times Square.   On view at Richard L. Feigen & Company are 29 paintings in an exhibition called \\"Richard Smith, the Green Gallery Years, 1960-1963.\\" Partly because Mr. Smith returned to England later in the 60's and did not settle in New York again until 1978, he isn't widely known here. But his reputation may also lag because his early paintings defy the conventional categories. They are linked to Pop, but they also relate to Color Field painting, which was coming into its own as well in the early 60's. At the same time, they are connected with various strands of postwar British abstraction -- a relationship underscored by a show currently at the Adelson Galleries featuring more than a dozen British abstract painters.

And yet \\"The War Room,\\" their glimpse of behind-the-scenes maneuvers among Clinton strategists, finds new facets of the story and manages to coax cliffhanging suspense out of a fait accompli.   However much \\"The War Room\\" reveals about how Mr. Clinton won the election, its real subject is why he won. The true focus of this watchful, frankly admiring film is the Clinton campaign staff, with James Carville and George Stephanopoulos receiving star billing. The film presents these two as tireless new-breed strategists whose fast, aggressive tactics helped to reshape their party's political thinking, and who themselves played a high-profile role in the election.  Theirs was an attitude that promised something different in Presidential politics, and this film examines that attitude in riveting detail.

Mr. Shaw added some \\"Random Speculations\\" in which he took up the reform in political machinery and culture he wants for the social revolution. Excerpts from the stenographic report of his lecture make up the article below.YOU have all seen me throughout this course of lectures sitting on the platform listening very attentively to the ladies and gentlemen who have gone before me and who have been adumbrating as well as they could the course of events in the next ten years. One thing that I noticed about all of them was they all assumed that what was going to occur in the course of the next ten years was going to occur with our existing political machinery and in our existing culture.If you are going to make any great change in society, you must devise political machinery which will make that change, and if you want to introduce that political machinery you must produce a culture which will approve of which will tolerate and even vote for that particular change.Yet I heard no allusion to this at any of the previous lectures. All the lecturers were looking forward to very considerable changes, but they all seemed to assume that the machinery would be the same and that the culture would be the same. As far as I can remember, if any words dropped from them on the subject, it must have been during these brief periods when I found they were getting a little too abstract and I took the opportunity to slumber for a few moments. so I may be unjust to them.New Political Machinery,I just want shortly to give you a very rough sketch of the machinery which we want to bring us up to date at the present time, without any reference to the next ten or even fifty years. We shall want, of course, an extension of League of Nations diplomacy—diplomacy, practically in the widest sense, to be dictated through the League of Nations. And the powers must treat the League of Nations seriously. So far, until about a year ago, they never pretended to do so. They set up the League of Nations and made speeches about it, but when any serious question arose they never thought of going to the League of Nations. They set up conferences of their own, and sometimes, as in the case of Mussolini, they did not confer, they shot. * * *That sort of thing cannot go on if you are going to have a tolerable would to live in. Your diplomacy must be conducted by the League of Nations. But you still have a Foreign Office. Is the Foreign Office going to be the ridiculous backstairs business, in which every ambassador of a foreign power comes and exchanges little notes and interviews with the Foreign Secretary, and behind one another's backs, and everybody doing what they can to get the better of each other? I suggest no such thing should be possible, that our Foreign Office should not communicate in that way with separate ambassadors, but that there should be council of ambassadors who will transact business in one another's presence and with their cards on the table. Of course they will say, \\"Impossible! Did any one ever hear of such a thing?\\" I reply, \\"No, they did not, and see the mess you are in in consequence! Had you not better clear it up?\\"Then you want a great many Parliaments. Going on with this rotten, crazy old thing you have got is impossible. You want several Parliaments for several departments of work. You want a Commonwealth Parliament, a Parliament which will deal with the whole of the British Commonwealth as a whole. You then want a British Federal Parliament which will deal with the British details. Then you want national Parliaments. You have got one in Ireland, in Ulster, in England, but you will also have to have one in Scotland. But one is not enough. I think you will want at least two and probably three, You want a political Parliament, an industrial Parliament, and even that may not be enough. * * *Regional Parliaments.\\"Then you want regional parliaments. You cannot go on with your parish councils and rural and district councils and town planning, when as a matter of fact you want not the own but the whole province planned, the whole watershed of a river. Perhaps in England alone you will want about ten regional parliaments, and working beneath them you ought to have bodies of say three capable district commissioners, the sort of thing they have in Ireland, where, of course, the first act of the Irish Free State was to throw over all the democratic stuff you had given them, and get the thing into businesslike hands. But you want district commissioners who would work with, parish councils, district meetings if you like. They should have to meet representative bodies of the citizens in order to know what the people wanted.But there you have a whole scheme of bodies, and you want, of course, the proper men for them. How are you to get the men? I do not want them to pass examinations, that would be no use at all for what I want. What I want does not seem possible, though I am not sure we might not make an advance in the direction. I propose a panel system by which persons could be submitted to some kind of test, not an examination by asking them a lot of questions out of books, but that their natural capacity should be tested, either by testing their blood or secretions, or testing their electronic vibrations by Abraham's Box, or radiology, or some sort of scientific process, so that they could be classified according to their political and other capacities. One man, for instance, might be one of the very few men capable of diplomacy, that is to say, world politics","excerpt":"another man might be in the very rare position of being capable of finance. * * *Panels for the Parliaments.Then we should want another panel for men who have the capacity for one of the Parliaments I have sketched. You might want a man for the Commonwealth Parliament, another for the Federal Parliament, and another for the National Parliament. Of course, it is unfamiliar to you to think of a man requiring any sort of capacity in order to be in that body. But it is desirable that they should know a little more than how to read and write, if, indeed. they all do know how to read and write; we have no guarantee at present that they do.But if we had this, there might come a sort of sense into democracy, because you do want to allow people to have some choice, some power of election. If you give them the power of election they have at present they will elect the most awful people. I will not mention living instances, it would be too unkind, but when you remember one of the most popular persons in English literature was Titus Oates it will give you an idea what it comes to. Election would be a perfectly safe process If you had your panel system. Democracy under those conditions, and I do not see under what other conditions it is possible to get a satisfactory working of this method of allowing people to choose your governing bodies, would be quite safe.I do not want you to go out of the room without any notion what sort of machinery should be substituted, but I think all those, or something like those reforms I have mentioned will have to be introduced. It is the creation of this new machinery which is certainly the most urgent work of the next ten years.A New Culture.Now to deal with the great question of culture, which ought to have six lectures all to itself. At the present time, the culture which is predominant in this country which is the culture of the governing classes, and through their example and influence filters right down from the institutions in which they are brought up to the elementary schools, is what I might call the robber-baron morality I will not say of the Middle Ages, hardly even as advanced as that, but really the early feudal system. It goes on in a gentlemanly way for some time, but nationally there are the most horrible outbreaks of ferocity which the Middle Ages could not surpass.In my lifetime there have been such incidents as Amritsar in India, the Black and Tan episode in Ireland when Dublin was bombarded, and more than a square mile of the city was smashed to ruins, a pure piece of terrorism, quite unnecessary, and yet the thing was done. And a thing that amused the inhabitants very much was that the authorities, after having done this, plastered up recruiting posters on the ruins and said, \\"Irishmen, remember Belgium.\\"Lock at the recent government, which began by declaring they would stop up the Nile and starve Egypt, because they were drunk with their victory at the election and irritated because the Sirdar had been assassinated. It was not even an intelligent threat. It only made England ridiculous in the eyes of the world, and at the end of a week they had to climb down abjectly. Nobody except people with that curious mixture of robber-baron and schoolboy morality could have thought of such a thing.Then because they thought the Russians were low people they broke into the offices of the Russian Government in London and did not find anything. But it is no use complaining, it is only part of the culture that we instil. I hope you will understand the Russian remedy. When the Russians did carry through their revolution, and there was no democratic nonsense about it, they had to reconstruct, and they had the sense, to know what we have not the sense to know, that the whole future of the State they were setting up would depend on the culture, in the sense I have been using the word, the education of the child from the beginning—their lessons, their morals, their manners, their religion.Accordingly, they said, there is one absolute condition. No person who has ever been at the Russian equivalent of an English university or an English public school shall ever be allowed to get into contact with a Russian child, even if for the first years we have to go on with scavengers as professors and teachers, with men who have to learn tonight the lesson they are going to teach tomorrow.University Men Excluded.I have no hesitation in telling you if some strange accident upset everything in this country, and made me a dictator, the first thing I should do would be to say, No man who has ever gone from Eton to Oxford, from Harrow to Cambridge, from Marlborough to Sandhurst, shall come within a mile of an English child if I can possibly help it.We must get rid of this culture: we must get rid of it from, the beginning; we must get it out of our elementary schools. Certainly that is one of the things that is before the Minister of Education. The one thing Oxford does teach efficiently and thoroughly is the Oxford mentality. There is not a single one of the other things it teaches that cannot be learned better without going to Oxford, but to get that mentality you must go to Oxford, and they will get it into you with the most extraordinary success.Secondly, one of the first acts of an intelligent government would be to make a law disqualifying graduates and undergraduates of our universities from, all public employment, making them ineligible for election to any \\"public body,\\" and in particular disqualifying them for the post of teacher. * * *People who are brought up on the Bible as we are at present are unfit to manage a modern whelk stall, much less a great Commonwealth. As you all know, I do not suppose anybody has fought harder against materialism than I have; nevertheless, that sort of materialism which the Russians are now teaching in their schools is far better, even at its hardest and worst and narrowest, than deliberately teaching children lies which everybody knows to be lies.

A1    Bush Defends Spy Program  President Bush continued to defend both the legality and the necessity of the National Security Agency's domestic eavesdropping program, and he denied that he misled the public last year when he insisted that any government wiretap required a court order. Mr. Bush's strong defense of the program came as Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, called on the administration to make available current and former high-level officials to explain the evolution of the secret program.   A11    Assessing Damage After Storm  Northern California assessed its storm damage: Napa County was hit hardest by a drenching storm that forced hundreds of residents out of their homes and closed scores of roads. Now Southern California is bracing for approaching storms that the authorities said could set off mudslides.   A8    Homes as Investments  As home prices have soared in recent years, many houses have become not just nice places to live but remarkably valuable investments as well. Responding to this newly embedded wealth, hundreds of thousands of families living in suburbs of cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco, have transformed their homes into something grander and more personal.   A1    SPORTSMONDAY   D1-7    A Former Football Star's Fall  Maurice Clarett, who three years ago this week led Ohio State's football team to the national title, was sought by the police in Columbus, Ohio, as a suspect in an armed robbery.The situation may further the downward spiral for Clarett, 22, a running back once considered one of the most talented players in college football.   D1    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-7    Bloomberg Is OptimisticIn Inaugural Address  In his second inaugural address, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg projected unabashed optimism as he promised to pursue an ambitious housing program, to begin a national campaign against illegal guns and to ''lock in and extend'' his program to improve city schools.   A1    Four Are Killed in City  The year 2006 began with a streak of deadly violence in New York City, with four men killed after midnight in three separate attacks before sunrise. A 17-year-old high school sophomore was stabbed in Queens, and three other men died in shootings in Manhattan and Queens.   B3    M.T.A. Defends Settlement  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority defended a settlement it signed last week, arguing that the transit union's concession to collect a contribution toward the cost of members' health insurance is worth more than the authority's original pension demands. It will also urge the state to revoke the union's ability to collect dues through automatic payroll deduction.   B1    ARTS   E1-14    Hollywood In New Zealand  Hollywood filmed two of the biggest fantasy films of the year in New Zealand -- ''King Kong'' and ''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' -- where the successful ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy was filmed. Not everyone is happy about it, and some fear that the country is turning into Hollywood's studio back lot and that it will be harder for New Zealand filmmakers to tell their own nation's story.   E3    Casanova's Soundtrack  It might be said that, along with Venice itself, Baroque music plays the libertine's accomplice in the new movie ''Casanova.'' But while Baroque music lovers may recognize familiar passages, the excerpts have been stitched together in an original way, actually creating ''new'' Baroque works.

He later became a powerful boxing promoter, he was 93.   B7    BUSINESS DAY   C1-8    Taking On the Media  News reporters find themselves under increasing scrutiny, as dissatisfied interview subjects take to the Internet through e-mail and especially the amplifying power of Web logs to correct the record or to make sure the story is told from their perspective. It could shift the center of gravity in the way that news is gathered and presented.   C1    Technological Convergence  The biggest trend expected at the International Consumer Electronics Show is the blending of products like televisions and audio gear with personal computers, in an effort to create a stream of data, video and music.   C1    Virtual Product Placement  Digital product placement was introduced largely as a cost-saving technology, but it has gained traction on network television as advertisers look beyond the traditional 30-second spot to reach consumers.   C1    Cellphone Shopping Trend  Analysts and retail executives are expecting a big rise in shopping by cellphone as people are quickly accepting phones as multipurpose devices, with billions already spent on ring tones, wallpaper and games.

The brick mill buildings that once stood on the waterfront site, known as the New London Mills property, have been torn down. In their place, a 150-room Marriott Hotel and an 87,500-square-foot center, which includes an amphitheater, will be built during the first phase of construction. The second phase consists of a 360-degree theater, exhibition areas and expansion of the learning center. A whaling village with shops is scheduled for the third phase. Plans also include a restaurant and cafeteria, conference rooms, a waterfront park, a dock and moorings. Construction is expected to start this spring, and opening day is planned for July 4, 1996.

The book opens with Jacques darting from Moss, Balthazar and other SoHo landmarks to a condo's private roof garden (with its own resistance pool) and a posh marble bathroom with six-foot soaking tub.

Then one day she and her infant daughter become lost in  the wilderness, and for months they wander about, trying to find their way. Through her harrowing ordeal, Catherwood learns to divest herself of sentiment and fear, including the fear of \\"man judgment,\\" until she comes to understand that there are \\"many roads through wilderness, many paths to the city.\\" In describing this process, Ms. Youmans's language is trenchant, graceful and, in places, sumptuously archaic, filled with a richness that provides more than just period color. Her prodigious powers of description render with acuity both small moments and large: the sea crossing, childbirth, snowfall, the slitting of a fawn's throat, the \\"rammish\\" stench of a trapper.

Without considering the question raised in England concerning its being a glorification of the English public school boy, but reviewing it from the standpoint of the impression it may make over here, it can be stated that from a pictorial angle, which includes the splendidly natural performances of all the players, it is worthy of the high praise accorded it by the majority of English critics. But its vocal recording leaves much to be desired, for frequently it is impossible to understand what the participants are saying. This is not due to their manner of speech, but apparently to the acoustics or to the German sound process employed.Although some of the lines are indistinct, the march of events detailing the landing at Gallipoli and the eventual evacuation of that war zone in January, 1916, are set forth in a stirring fashion. It was an undertaking in which the British Admiralty cooperated by putting at the disposal of the producers warships of the Mediterranean squadron. Some of the scenes were pictured at Malta, where sites were found that resembled the Anzac and \\"V\\" beaches of the Gallipoli peninsula.The glimpses of the British in boats making for the shore are effectively filmed, as are others revealing the fighters at the mercy of the rifles and machine guns of the Turks. In the course of the story, the Turkish gun, known to the British as \\"Clara,\\" comes in for dramatic instance of heroism.This narrative is based on Ernest Raymond's novel, \\"Tell England,\\" and at the end of the picture there is the quotation: \\"Tell England ye who pass this monument, that we died for her and here we rest content.\\" This story is in some respects vaguely like \\"Journey's End,\\" in that it has a dispute between two chums and a jolly Captain, who is last heard singing, \\"Just One More Rubber,\\" and a little later his life is snuffed out by a Turkish bullet.In several sequences there is a successful effort in depicting the coolness of the fighters while the guns are booming, either by showing them playing bridge, writing letters or chatting.Frederick Lloyd gives a clever performance as the nonchalant Captain. Carl Harbord and Tony Bruce portray the school pals of old, and Lionel Hedges lends a good comedy touch as a sniffling soldier. Sam Wilkinson and Wally Patch also do well by their parts.

Since the French studios virtually stopped producing around the first of the year the houses have been drawing upon last year's crop, so to speak—films produced during 1931, or at least started then. There is talk of new quotas against foreign pictures and all sorts of drastic measures.At this particular time, for instance, there are no less than eight different Paris houses showing American pictures in the original versions, another displaying dubbed versions, while two other theatres alternate American with French films. Then there are some four or five cinemas showing German pictures, either in the original or in French versions.It would be hard to say whether French audiences prefer American or German films—they are flocking impartially to both kinds. What they seem to want chiefly is variety—new pictures, whatever they are or wherever they come from. Three of the most popular pictures in Paris now, for instance, are \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue,\\" \\"Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" and \\"Hell Divers\\"—all of which are decidedly American. However, they are doing no better than the German \\"Mädchen in Uniform,\\" which has taken Paris by storm, and the French version of \\"Sturme um Leidenschaft,\\" which is hardly less popular.Paris has had a new one within the past week. This is from one of the detective thrillers of Georges Simenon, whose Commissaire Maigret is quite as well known here as Charlie Chan is across the Atlantic. It is called \\"La Nuit du Carrefour (\\"The Night at the Crossroads\\")—a suitable title, for all the action takes place at night at a lonely crossroads not far from Paris.A Dutch diamond merchant is found shot to death in the garage of one of the two houses at the crossroads. It is occupied by a Dane, Andersen, and his pretended sister. Commissaire Maigret visits the spot and becomes involved in a train of mysteries and horrors in which two other people are shot. There are weird scenes in the house of the Dane, pursuits of men and autos in the pouring rain at night, and, for dénouement, the unmasking of a gang of narcotic drug traffickers.These are excellent ingredients for an exciting evening's entertainment, needless to say, and the director and actors make the most of their opportunities. It is a miracle of photography, the action taking place wholly at night, and when outdoors in a downpour of rain. Jean Renoir, the director, has quits evidently inherited his father's pictorial genius. The Renoir family, in fact, almost steal the whole show, for the part of Commissaire Maigret is played by another son of Auguste Renoir, Pierre, who makes a most successful screen début. The woman's part is interpreted by the lovely Winna Winfried, the Norwegian star who has played in certain English pictures produced at Hollywood.The most expensive and most advertised films are not necessarily the best. As so often happens when French producers seek to capitalize the popularity of a certain type of picture for which Hollywood has set the fashion. \\"Sous le Casque de Cuir\\" (\\"Under the Leather Helmet\\")—one of those war aviation stories—is a rather poor imitation of American productions of its type.One has a right to ask that if the French must produce that sort of film they at least do it mechanically as well and not use a worn-out plot. They have done neither in this case. The air scenes are tame and unconvincing, and the plot is one of those which can be figured out in the first five minutes and thereafter holds no surprises.The setting is a Rumanian aviation camp. One night a beautiful young woman arrives carrying papers from headquarters showing she was to be obeyed by all the aces. The captain falls in love with her","excerpt":"another plays the villain and causes mischief. She asks to be conducted over the enemy lines to a cháteau, where a traitor is preparing to yield many secret papers to the Germans. The captain sets her down nonchalantly in the grounds of the castle and leaves her to join an orgy, which one must admit is somewhat better as an orgy than Hollywood would be allowed to do. There she is discovered and condemned to be shot at dawn, but she manages to kill the traitor, steal his papers, and fly away with the captain, who returns in the hick of time. Then there is the inevitable chase by enemy planes, with the Rumanian squadron coming up, also in the nick of time, and saving the day.One's reaction is simply that it is too bad that the producers took it upon themselves to imitate instead of to produce something French. It is the same old story to which every new picture gives proof: the talking film in the French language must be true to the French spirit, otherwise it is like a bad translation of a book.And on that subject a charming and really French film was opened here last week by Paramount—\\"La Couturière de Lunéville\\" (\\"The Dressmaker of Lunéville\\"), from the well-known play by Alfred Savoir. It is one of those artificial comedies with an impossible situation at the basis of it, but which carries one away by the charm and skill of its acting and production.Anna, a simple little dressmaker, is abandoned by Lieutenant Rollon after a brief liaison. Ten years later we see her, transformed into a great film star, calling herself Irene Salvago, just returned from Hollywood. One evening she meets Rollon, now a banker. He doesn't recognize her, or even remember Anna, when she dresses again as the little dressmaker of Lunéville. But she wins him over, showing herself now as the dressmaker, now as the film star. It is Rollon's time to suffer until he learns at last that Anna and Irene Salvago are one person for him to love and live with.

One, a little more than an hour-length version of Maupassant's \\"Boule de Suif,\\" is little more than a musty curio. But the other, a long color documentary titled \\"In the Pacific,\\" is consistently diverting, often extraordinary.The Maupassant picture was made without sound in 1934 and looks it. Yesterday, in its extremely belated American unveiling by Artkino, the Mosfilm production was refurbished with a rather skimpy narration added to old-style subtitle frames. These antiquated interruptions just about flatten the proceedings, along with the murky photography of some interesting faces—the Moscow Art Players.However, the famous story is faithfully followed and is still pretty wonderful as a yarn and a scathing commentary on hypocrisy and selfishness. The time is the Franco-Prussian War and, again, Maupassant's title heroine is a patriotic fille de joie who saves some mean stagecoach passengers by accommodating a lecherous German officer.As the simple-minded but brave little harlot, a buxom brunette named Ganya Sergeyeva is perfectly cast. But a later 1947 French version of \\"Boule de Suif,\\" with Micheline Presle, under the title \\"Angel and Sinner,\\" mops the floor with this one.\\"In the Pacific\\" runs for an hour, with very few dull moments. The Russians, in fact, have sent us a generally excellent documentary of marine life in the waters and occasionally on the shores of remote Far East islands. Photographed in good subdued color by a roving unit of the Moscow Popular Science Film unit, this impromptu but enlightening pic-ture is one that no child or would-be frogman should miss.In truly fascinating close-up, we study some of the eeriest inhabitants of the ocean floor—microbes, mollusks, the voracious ruff, the hermit crab and many others. One memorable shot shows a starfish aiming its stomach squarely at the camera diving-bell and absorbing a prey","excerpt":"another scene brings us eye to eye with a writhing octopus. Still another sequence minutely examines a living bed of limestone coral.Since a good half of the picture is submerged, it should be noted that \\"In the Pacific\\" is nowhere nearly so spectacular or smooth as a French counterpart, \\"The Silent World.\\" Nor, we might add, so pretentious. The handful of photographers, headed by a limber lady named Nina Yurushinkaya, and the director A. Zguridi, disarmingly bob in and out of the footage and the deceptive beauty of their oceanic flora and fauna.But the seals—some 100,000 of them—steal the show. And one long gliding shot of a gigantic colony of the furry animals blackening the rocks of Yona Island is simply eye-popping. The din is terrific.

The film which it designates, now on view at the Warner Theatre, is an unimportant little drama of the railroad yards, rendered pleasantly enough by Grant Withers, Mary Astor and Regis Toomey. If nothing else, the picture represents a triumph for the Warner rain machines, which deluge the screen with profuse and workmanlike raindrops for the latter half of the story. There may be a legitimate doubt as to the dramatic integrity of the plot, but no one will deny the high quality of the rain.The question at issue in \\"Other Men's Women\\" is what happens when a wife falls in love with her husband's best friend. The answer is fairly complicated but may be summarized succinctly. The best friend kisses the wife, realizes that he is a cad, and goes off on an extended drunk to forget. The wife, having been kissed by the best friend, exhibits such agitation at the supper table that the husband realizes something has happened. The husband then picks a quarrel with the best friend while the train on which they work is in motion. The husband's head strikes an iron projection and he becomes blind. The best friend accepts responsibility for the accident and loses six weeks' pay. The husband, realizing that the wife and the best friend were meant for each other, stumbles out in the rain and takes an engine over a Crumbling bridge. After a fitting expression of sorrow, the best friend and the wife are married and begin planting flowers in the garden.Mr. Toomey acts the husband, Mr. Withers is the best friend and Miss Astor is the wife. Joan Blondell, James Cagney and J. Farrell MacDonald are among the assistant players.

FIVE PREMIERS MONDAY. \\"Hawk Island\\" the Latest Addition --Ten Productions Next Week."},{"year":"1929","title":"Ruth Taylor, who gave a pleasing impersonation of Lorelei Lee in the silent pictorial adaptation of Anita Loos's bright story \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,\\" is now to be seen at the Little Carnegie Playhouse in her first talking film, \\"The College Coquette,\\" which was produced by Columbia Pictures Corporation. It is an ingenuous and mildly amusing romantic sketch, but the vocal reproduction yesterday afternoon was extremely poor. There were periods when the voices were out of synchronization, and after this failing had been remedied the tones were ludicrously uneven, so much so that the speech of close-ups was in several instances more subdued than that of the full-length figures, and then, possibly through the treachery of the microphone, the voices of both Miss Taylor and her partner, Jobyna Ralston, appeared to be curiously childish.In this current offering Miss Taylor officiates as a shameless but attractive little flirt, known as Betty Forrester, who, after proving once again that the masculine element is by no means safe in the presence of big blue eyes and fair hair, coupled, of course, with a trim figure, she, with harmless prevarication and a show of injured innocence, eventually brings to bay the handsome and popular athletic coach, Harvey Porter, for whom she sets her cap the moment she enters the coeducational institution.Miss Forrester is most attentive to her attire, which makes her all the more winsome. Mr. Porter stands his ground at first against the almost tearful protestations of Miss Forrester. He scolds her for telling falsehoods and he insists sternly on punctuality and precision in the setting-up exercises, but he is vulnerable at the psychological moment when he gazes at the carefully bobbed hair of this fickle student.During the screening of this film there are the inevitable wild antics of the freshmen and sophomores and also a scene in which Doris Marlowe imbibes far too freely of a certain alcoholic beverage. Miss Marlowe's mother frowns upon the friendship between her daughter and Betty Forrester, but she is evidently unable to separate the two, except in their own home town. The two girls are roommates at college and their curriculum, aside from occasional gymnastic exercises, appears to be one continued round of gayety and inconstant heart affairs.William Collier Jr. does fairly well as one of the students. John Holland is good looking and manly as Porter. Miss Ralston's utterances are frequently indistinct, which criticism also applies occasionally to Miss Taylor.\\"St. Louis Blues.\\"On the same program at the Rialto with that splendid talking picture, \\"Bulldog Drummond,\\" there is a short audible negro sketch, called \\"St. Louis Blues.\\" It was directed by Dudley Murphy, who was responsible for that exotic cinematic feature, \\"Ballet Mecanique.\\" The singing in this new subject is effectively recorded and the scenes in a cabaret thronged with blacks are adroitly filmed. It is, however, a sordid study in which there is a decided vein of vulgarity. It may be realism, but it is spoiled by being distasteful.The \\"blues\\" are chanted as a result of a negress being deserted by her paramour, a light-footed, slick specimen. The negress is heard singing her mournful melody, first in a room after a drink of gin and subsequently at a bar in the cabaret. Her vocal efforts inspire the blacks seated at the tables to join in the dirge and the waiters in finding the gloomy air infectious step to the tones while one spins his platter on his finger.The acting is unusually good of its kind.

As it later turns out, these two people are ensconced on the very same sofa, and they have been lovers for nine years, ever since they were introduced by their neighborhood Avon lady.One of the most appealing things about this graceful, funny and often very moving documentary, now at the Eastside Cinema, is its altogether disarming presentation of material that might have invited prejudice or misunderstanding; in this case, what could have been a titillating revelation is artfully molded into nothing more than a wry and tender little surprise. \\"Word Is Out,\\" made by the Mariposa Film Group, is comfortably constructed and quite informative, but what really carries the film is its casual seductiveness. Even filmgoers who imagine they'd rather sit through root canal work than find out what it's like to be homosexual may wind up unexpectedly captivated by the film's friendly, even-handed approach to a potentially divisive subject.\\"Word Is Out\\" is at times extremely romantic, full of people gently reminiscing about what it was like to fall in love for the first time. And, as befits its romantic spirit (and its obvious desire to appeal to filmgoers of all sexual persuasions), the movie leaves sex to the imagination. One woman, who stridently announces herself to be a black lesbian (and who sits before a stained-glass window bearing a combined feminist and black power logo), simply talks about the way she gradually found herself looking forward to lunch dates with a particular woman friend much more enthusiastically than she awaited her dates with men in the evening.A man wistfully describes an adolescent crush that blossomed into a 10-year love affair. And another man, a student, remembers being so thrilled by someone who brushed against his knee as they watched Part Three of Kenneth Clark's \\"Civilisation\\" series that he eagerly dashed back to catch Parts Four and Five.The film's most stirring sequence involves a young man who dated the same girl for years but never felt adequate to the situation. Then he had a quick homosexual experience; still, the earth failed to move. Finally, he met a man he could really care about. \\"When I was in high school, I thought I was one of those cold people who could never love anybody,\\" he says quietly. \\"And when I fell in love with this guy, it meant so much to me. It meant I was a real person . . . I was using a part of myself that I never felt before . . . and the best part, too.\\" At a preview screening of \\"Word Is Out,\\" there wasn't a dry eye in the house after that particular revelation.Much of the film is laced with humor: a hefty comedienne recalls joining the WAC's, marching into the mess hall and hearing cries of \\"Good god, Elizabeth, here comes another one!\\" One fellow in makeup and a nose ring complains that \\"toy stores are sexist, so you have to buy the Ken doll and then go over to Barbie's department to get a tutu.\\"Most of the interviewees are quite appealing, but a few of them aren't, and that's one of the film's most refreshing aspects. One man, an actor who endlessly congratulates himself for being \\"weird,\\" would be a bit grating under any circumstances. The film simply presents him as part of a very broad spectrum, and the lack of any insistence upon gay supremacy or solidarity leaves the viewer quite free to draw his or her own conclusions.The people presented here range from their 20's to their 70's, from being almost overbearingly articulate to communicating mostly through facial gestures, from being extroverted and affectionate to feeling isolated and private. The one thing they seem to have in common—something that makes the film particularly attractive—is a kind of confidence and certainty, the ability to speak matter-of-factly and behave with firm conviction.

However we regard this solemn matter, it is clear that shows from the golden age (whenever it was supposed to be) have one great advantage: They've stood the test of time. Good ones linger on, turning up in syndication. Some of them not only linger, they generate fan clubs, congresses of people whose devotion to old episodes is so intense they can recite every line. Whatever the fascination these television programs hold for the loyalists, it is obvious that they attract the rest of us, too. Fan clubs alone do not keep programs in syndication; large audiences do. Something about the old programs gets us where we live.     Consider ''The Honeymooners,'' the eternally fresh saga of Ralph and Alice Kramden and their upstairs neighbors, Trixie and Ed Norton. It was born in 1951, when Jackie Gleason created Ralph Kramden on the old DuMont network's ''Cavalcade of Stars.'' A year later, CBS enlisted Mr. Gleason and presented him in ''The Jackie Gleason Show,'' segments of which were ''Honeymooners'' sketches. In 1955, ''The Honeymooners'' became a series of its own; 39 half-hour programs were filmed, and although they may be considered classics today, in the mid-1950's they were seen only as middling.

In recent decades, he noted, ANS medals have been limited to such themes as anniversaries of the organization itself\\n\\nThe competition is under the direction of the ANS Committee on Medals and Decorations headed by Dr. Stahl. His committee has specified that one side of the medal should bear a representation of the Statue of Liberty, while the other should deal with the concept of liberty. In addition, the medal must carry the dates 1886 and 1986 plus the name of the society or its official insignia which is an oak-leaf cluster.
