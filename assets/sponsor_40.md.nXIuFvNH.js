And as Monday's release of a new report criticizing choice proved, few are so ideological and divisive.

No matter how you feel when you go into the theater, you feel better coming out.\\"Serial,\\" a satire about life in Marin County, one of San Francisco's most modish and affluent suburbs, is a post-card-pretty, very cheerful comedy, but it's also a movie you have to meet more than halfway. You shouldn't see it if you're worrying about income tax or aching to read Patrick White's \\"The Twyborn Affair\\" or are just generally depressed. You're likely to find it as redundant as a parody of Dr. Joyce Brothers.Given the proper circumstances, though, you may find \\"Serial\\" a lark. Even if you don't laugh nonstop, you'll smile a lot. It's difficult to resist a movie that contains a marriage ceremony that begins when a WASPily with-it minister announces, \\"Fellow members of the human community, we're going to unit two separateness,\\" and concludes with his saying, \\"I now pronounce you pair-bonded for as long as this relationship continues.\\"Like \\"The Serial,\\" Cyra McFadden's novel-with-drawings on which the screenplay is based, \\"Serial\\" is an almost completely dead-panned examination of American civilization as it appears to have peaked a couple of years ago in Marin County, a place where everyone is beautiful and has everything a person could possibly desire, including imported bicycles, a psychiatrist just down the road, other men's wives (and other wives' husbands), organic food, and, of course, wall-to-wall neuroses. From sun up to sundown the people in \\"Serial\\" are miserable.Among them are Kate (Tuesday Weld) and Harvey Holroyd (Martin Mull), who aren't relating the way they used to, partly because they have a negative family dynamic that, eventually, drives their teenage daughter off to a San Francisco cult called the Church of Christian Oriental Harmony. There are also Martha (Sally Kellerman), now on her fifth or sixth husband, and her 10-year-old son Stokeley (Anthony Battaglia), who's in therapy designed to put him in touch with his childhood.Other members of the community include Sam (Bill Macy) and his wife Angela (Nita Talbot), who long for a youth forever gone","excerpt":"Carol (Pamela Bellwood), the community's beautiful nymphomaniac; Leonard (Peter Bonerz), the local shrink who says such things as \\"What we're talking about here is a real mental meltdown;\\" Spike (Tom Smothers), the swinging clergyman, and a weekend motorcyle gang whose members dress up like Hell's Angels and listen to Judy Garland records.There are many amusing conceits in \\"Serial\\" and they run on horizontally, as the title promises, at the predictable pace of a soap opera. To have shaped the material more dramatically, Bill Persky, the director, and Rich Eustis and Michael Elias, who wrote the screenplay, would have had to distort the form, which is one of the funnier things about the film. \\"Serial\\" is a kind of condensed, upper middle class \\"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\\" without the presense of Louise Lasser.However, it does have Martin Mull, who was so fine in the \\"Mary Hartman\\" television series. He's a witty actor, even when the screenplay insists that his be the one voice of sanity in Marin County. The others are all supremely, hilariously self-fixated, particulary Miss Weld, Miss Kellerman and Mr. Macy, who has the movie's one more or less straight moment as he reports, sadly, that his psychiatrist has told him he was having a nervous breakdown when \\"I just thought I was having a good time.\\" Also effective is Rexford Metz's photography — all primary colors and as crystal clear and unshadowed as a cartoon. The houses and stores and boutiques of Marin County, as well as the San Francisco skyline across the bay, have the blemish-free, idealized look of an architect's drawing.The principal point of \\"Serial,\\" which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, is language, an appreciation of the sort of jargon that may well bring this country to a halt long before inflation, deflation or the complete cut-off of Arab oil. \\"Serial\\" is aware that as language becomes more mechanical and muddled, so do the people using it.

ATLANTIC COASTLINE     A 13,000-mile-cruise from Camden, Me., to Rio de Janeiro is the subject of a slide presentation and reception honoring Roger David Stone at 7 P.M. on Wednesday in the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale.    Mr. Stone was the skipper of the Sanderling, a 38-foot cutter in which he made the journey almost five years ago to assess the environmental crises affecting the Atlantic coast. He and his crew documented pollution of fisheries, bays, estuaries and rivers of North and South America.  As part of his presentation, he will suggest what can be done to prevent further damage and recover from what has already taken place.    Mr. Stone, a 1955 graduate of Yale and formerly chief of the Time-Life bureau in Rio de Janeiro, was vice-president of the World Wildlife Fund from 1982 to 1986. Currently he is a senior fellow of the World Wildlife Fund.    Admission to the program is $12. The museum is at 170 Whitney Avenue in New Haven. Call 432-3730 for more information. LANDSCAPES ON CANVAS     An exhibition of 30 works by George F. Muendel, painted between 1898 and 1920, will be on display at the Greenwich Gallery of American Art, 6 West Putnam Avenue, through May 15.    Born in Hoboken, N. J., in 1871, Muendel started his professional life as a silver designer for Tiffany's in Manhattan. He lived in the Cos Cob and Riverside areas of Greenwich and in the Rowayton section of Norwalk, and he studied for several years with Leonard Ochtman, founder of the Greenwich Society of Artists. His style emerged as Impressionistic with a bent toward realism.    His work was exhibited at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, where he won first prize in a 1914 show, and at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the Carnegie Institute in Manhattan and the Chicago Institute of Fine Arts. Since his death in 1948, his work has not received much attention, and many of the works in this exhibition were acquired unframed and in dire need of repair.    \\"We were not overly familiar with the artist,\\" said the proprietor of the gallery, Abby Taylor. \\"But because we are in Greenwich, and he was so closely aligned with the area, and because he was such an early and skillful practitioner of American Impressionism, we felt that it was a worthwhile undertaking.\\"     The works are priced from $450 to $7,500. Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., and the phone number is 622-4494. CREATURE COMPOSITIONS     \\"Carnival of the Animals\\" is the title of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra family concert on Saturday at 11 A.M. in Bushnell Hall, Hartford. The Saint-Saens composition of that name is one of the selections. Under the direction of Michael Lankester, the orchestra will cover the creatures that inspired Ravel's \\"Mother Goose Suite,\\" Vaughan Williams's \\"Wasps,\\" Rossini's \\"Thieving Magpie,\\" Rimsky-Korsakov's \\"Flight of the Bumblebee,\\" Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake\\" and Bach's \\"Sheep May Safely Graze.\\"    Lark Popov and George Vona will be the pianists for the Saint-Saens work, and John McDonough, a founding member of the Company One Theater in Hartford, will be the narrator.

'BLACK PRINTMAKERS'     During the 1930's and early 40's the Federal Works Projects Administration supplied artists struggling through the Depression with employment, equipment and an opportunity to experiment with new techniques. It also provided black artists with their first full participation in the American art scene.    An exhibition called \\"Black Printmakers and the W.P.A.\\" opens Tuesday at the Walsh Gallery of Fairfield University, celebrating Black History Month and offering an overview of the work produced by black artists through the agency's Graphic Arts Division, although not much of it survives.     The artists represented include Charles Alston, Ernest Crichlow, Norman Lewis, William Henry Johnson and Raymond Steth. The images and techniques vary widely, and the subject matter reflects many of the injustices that became catalysts for the civil rights movement. The spirituality of black church services, the history of black music and the terrors visited by the Ku Klux Klan are depicted.   The exhibit remains through Feb. 9. Gallery hours are from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday. A HUMAN LANDSCAPE     \\"John Coplans -- Matrix 113,\\" an exhibition of 11 black-and-white photographs by Mr. Coplans, an art critic and former director of the Akron (Ohio) Art Museum, opens today the Wadsworth Athenenum in Hartford. It remains through March 31.    The nude self-portraits by the artist, who recently celebrated his 70th birthday, are large in scale, \\"startling and elegant at the same time,\\" said Andrea Miller-Keller, the museum's curator of contemporary art. \\"He relentlessly and innovatively explores his aging body as a landscape, capturing the human figure in unexpected configurations. His images suggest readings of the form as both abstract and richly detailed.\\"    The Atheneum, at 600 Main Street, is open from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Sunday. Admission is $3, $1.50 for students and the elderly, free to children under 13. Everyone is admitted free on Thursdays and from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M. on Saturdays. Call 278-2670 for more information.

Mr. Endres is a certified philatelic appraiser and a member of the American Philatelic Society. He has been a dealer in White Plains for two decades and a stamp collector for 29 years.   \\"It's not a short-term investment,\\" Mr. Endres said, \\"and to have a good long-term investment you should collect classical material in very good condition, not large quantities of modern issues.\\"   He observed that good buying conditions have existed since 1988 when people started selling their holdings at discount prices during the recession. \\"Now we are seeing an increase in price and a shortage of supply,\\" Mr. Endres said, because what was purchased in the recession \\"is being held by the buyers for future appreciation.\\"   The Pacific Rim countries, especially China, are the hot spots for stamp collectors today, Mr. Endres said. \\"Some 1970's Chinese issues are extremely desirable,\\" he said. \\"They were illegal to own or to use as postage in China because they contained inflammatory political slogans.

JOHN JAY CHRISTMAS   The re-creation of Christmases past at historic sites provides a major source of entertainment, and the John Jay Homestead in Katonah, a New York State Historic Site, always puts on a first-rate show.   It will begin next Saturday with tours of the Federal-style mansion from noon to 5 P.M., continuing Sunday and the weekend of Dec. 10 and 11 at the same hours. The house will be decorated from top to bottom, and a full complement of antique crystal, china, silver and replicated 19th-century foods will be set up in the dining room. The parlor, where it was customary to adjourn for the last course of the Christmas dinner, will display desserts, and in the study, a punch bowl filled with citrus juices and Madeira will stand at the ready.   The decorations and foods have been carefully researched from notes left by the Jay family, and visitors who do not wish to be part of a tour may stroll through the house at will, guided by a descriptive brochure.   Special programs include Paul Peabody and his puppets on Dec. 10 at 1 and 3:30 P.M. Children may sit on the floor at the foot of the stage, but chairs will be available for parents. After each show, cookies and apple cider will be served.   On Dec. 11 the Bedford Bell Ringers will perform at 1 and 3:30 P.M. in the ballroom, and downstairs in the kitchen a costumed cook will talk about preparing Christmas feasts on an open hearth. Visitors will be offered samples from 19th-century recipes.   More than 5,000 come to the homestead holiday celebrations, and it is wise to arrive for the puppet and bell-ringer performances at least an hour early.   Daily admission is $6, $5 for children and people 65 and older. Proceeds help maintain the historic site on Route 22 off Exit 6 of I-684. Call 232-5651 for more information.

A dramatic structure was given the movie when, by chance, the children's cook and confidante died during the filming, precipitating an orgy of emotional hysteria, all of which is caught by the cameras.Although I've seen \\"Warrendale\\" twice—first when it was shown last year at the Lincoln Center Film Festival, and yesterday when it opened its commercial engagement at the Evergreen Theater, I'm still not sure about my feelings for it. There is, of course, the fascination with real-life observed, but the real-life is so special, so heightened, in effect, that one tends to look at the children as if they were some kind of sideshow. There is also the suspicion, which I'm told is unfounded, that the presence of the camera might prompt over-reaction on the part of the children.Jean Renoir, the great French film director, saw \\"Warrendale\\" and afterward wondered how fiction, \\"animated by professional actors,\\" could ever compete with this recording of real emotions. In the same manner, I wonder how one can criticize this very special movie, except to say that it is beautifully photographed and edited.Otherwise, like the life it records, it simply exists, beyond criticism.

It seems to be the fashion, and Seventh Avenue, as usual, is up on the trend.    Even among the top fashion houses, where gift-giving excesses are legendary, it has been a leaner, more socially conscious Christmas.

In lieu of a gift, Bill Blass donates to the Robin Hood Foundation for Homeless Children","excerpt":"Carolyne Roehm to a group that fights drug abuse; Carmelo Pomodoro to the Partnership for the Homeless.

There also seems to be more old-fashioned food then ever before, executives said.   \\"In my office, I've never received such a cross section of baked goods,\\" one executive said. \\"If I ate everything, it would cost me a fortune at Canyon Ranch.\\" It's a big difference from the liquor, caviar and four kinds of vinegar in recent seasons.   Some designers still send clothes, and some editors get entire outfits. But in general, booty is out. The Grinch hasn't stolen Christmas; gift-giving has just gotten some style. Tradition Is Chic     In a difficult period for men's wear sales, retailers have noticed a shift in taste. \\"It appears the contemporary fellows are looking for more traditional looks,\\" said Ira Neimark, the chairman of Bergdorf Goodman, whose new men's store opened this fall. Bergdorf's had been known for more avant-garde fashion looks before it opened its new store, but that category has moved slowly this season.   At Louis, Boston , another men's store with both traditional and very fashionable clothing, it's the same story.   \\"The decline of the dollar has made the purchase of men's clothing a significant thing,\\" said Murray Pearlstein, the owner of Louis, Boston, which imports much of its merchandise from Italy. \\"Men want something with staying power. It can't be frivolous.\\"   Young fashion-oriented men's designers are also drawing their inspiration from traditional men's wear.   \\"The navy blazer has become a staple in designer collections, including Comme des Garcons , Dries Van Noten and Dolce & Gabbana ,\\" said Rick Rector, Bergdorf's general merchandise manager. \\"There are subtle changes, but a navy blazer is a navy blazer is a navy blazer.\\"   Mr. Pearlstein said men's fashion designers had calmed down.   \\"They were trying to outdo themselves with gimmicks,\\" he said. \\"The customer doesn't want to be part of that circus anymore. He wants to be looked at as an elegant man, not somebody with a strange jacket.\\" Perfume Notes     At last, the perfect gift for the fashionable and musically inclined: in the mail came a compact disk titled \\"Fragrance: the Art of Perfume\\" from D.A. music.    \\"Imagine listing to original musical compositions, each written in praise of a fashion perfume,\\" said an accompanying letter. There are eight tunes in all, including such sure-fire hits as \\"Shalimar,\\" \\"Fendi,\\" \\"Joy\\" and \\"Givenchy III.\\" (Unfortunately, there is no \\"Giorgio.\\") The music was written by Michael Weisser, a German composer.
