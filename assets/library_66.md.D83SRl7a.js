Although it briskly records the date, Oct. 4, 1957, the Russians still aren't divulging the details of sputnik—at least in a public movie.Moving right on to the climax—a trick photography depiction of a huge bobbing \\"space station\\" and a \\"settled\\" moon, Mars and Venus—the English narrator simply says that all this will happen. Not might—will.As a historical interplanetary resumé and a prediction by the country that took the plunge, this Artkino release is quietly confident in tone, generally sweeping in pinpointing achievement while paying careful tribute to the Soviet Union's late Konstantin Tsiolkovsky as the \\"father of cosmic travel.\\" Bracketed with a documentary called \\"The World Dances,\\" running an hour in handsome color, it opened yesterday at the Cameo.Produced by Leningrad's Popular Science Films Studio, the picture is divided into three sections. First is a subdued but respectful tribute to Dr. Tsiolkovsky, the half-deaf teacher whose scientific theories, published in 1903, portended the carrier-rocket. A bearded actor named G. Soloveyev, brother of one of the two scenarists, unassumingly depicts Dr. Tsiolkovsky, to the tune of various charts on gravitational experiments.The picture then fans out widely, noting \\"other\\" progress in the field","excerpt":"special German advances; the 1929 rocket experiment of a \\"U. S. A. professor\\" (whose name flies past); and, finally, the 1937 launching of the \\"first Soviet rocket.\\" Then, rather cryptically, comes a \\"new era,\\" and some clever superimposed footage of the sputnik hurtling around the globe.What follows is pretty weak—the sight of three husky pilots self-consciously guiding a rocket into space and back. For excitement and even credibility (no kidding) George Pal's stunning \\"Destination Moon\\" (Hollywood, 1950) had it all over this Rover Boys sequence, sputnik or no sputnik.But the finale, part animation and part live action, caused some heavy breathing yesterday at the Cameo. Imagine—the Russians have—a huge, cosmic steering-wheel connecting all outer planets and honeycombed with laboratories, rocket hangars and dormitories (including television and the family cat). Again, the Russians, through a very calm narrator, call it a \\"reality, not a dream.\\"Almost as astounding is the fact that Moscow's last World Youth Festival has yielded a third feature documentary. Like its two predecessors, \\"The World Dances\\" records fragments of international performances, interspersed with street celebrations and shots of the Moscow skyline. The \\"show\\" flicks by like lightning—one viewer counted at least forty-two different countries—but the dances range from exotic to extraordinary. Many are both.For instance, they include Indians, Japanese, Egyptians, Ceylonese, Africans, Koreans, Mongolians and Chinese! Even for those who have already looked in on the Festival, Number Three is worth while. And all new, believe it or not. And crammed so full, surely there'll be still another film record.
