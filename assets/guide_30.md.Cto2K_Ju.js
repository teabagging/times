Shiva, 650 Park Ave, Thursday afternoon until Sunday evening. For information, Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 800-227-3974    COHEN--Alan N. 1931-2004. A leading executive in the sports and entertainment industries over the past 30 years, died Tuesday morning in his home in Boca Raton, Florida, after a long battle with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He was 73. Memorial services will be held at 10 AM Thursday morning, August 12, at the Park Avenue Synagogue (Madison & 86th Street) in New York City. Shiva will be observed Thursday night, Saturday night and Sunday at 650 Park Avenue in New York City. Mr. Cohen graduated from Columbia College in 1952 and Columbia Law School in 1954. After serving in the army, he joined Paul, Weiss, Rifkin, Wharton and Garrison in 1957 and became a partner of the firm in 1964. In 1970 he joined the entertainment company then known as Warner Communications (now Time Warner, Inc.) as executive vice president. While at Warner Communications, he had particular oversight of the company's recorded music subsidiaries, including Atlantic Records, Electra and Warner Brothers records. During this time he and several partners, including Warner CEO Steve Ross, purchased the New York franchise of a newly formed professional soccer league. The team was known as the New York Cosmos. It was to be the start of Mr. Cohen's long and influential involvement in major sports ownership. In 1974 he became chairman and CEO of Madison Square Garden Corporation, then a public corporation which owned the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers. In an interview with The New York Times, he was asked by a reporter if it were more important to win a championship or to earn profits for his shareholders. He replied that as a public company, his first priority was to his shareholders, ''that's the bottom line.'' As a result of this candid answer, he was known for a time in the sports pages as ''Bottom Line Cohen.'' In 1978, Mr. Cohen and a group of investors purchased the New Jersey Nets NBA basketball franchise. He moved the team to its current facility in the Meadowlands. In 1983, he sold his interest in the Nets, and together with his partners Don Gaston and Paul Dupee purchased the Boston Celtics, one of the most heralded franchises in all of sports. Under the ownership of Mr. Cohen and his partners, the Celtics enjoyed a decade of great success. Led by star players Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parrish, the Celtics of that era made nearly perennial appearances in the NBA Finals, winning the NBA championship in 1984 and 1986. As an NBA owner, Mr. Cohen played an active and influential role in the development of the league. He served as chairman of the NBA Board of Governors from 1985-1987. Along with Commissioner David Stern, Mr. Cohen was instrumental in the NBA's moving to adopt a salary cap structure for its teams. Now used in various forms by other professional sports leagues, the NBA pioneered the use of a salary cap. The NBA's salary cap guidelines have contributed to the prosperity and competitiveness of the league over the past 20 years. In recent years Mr. Cohen has been active in a variety of businesses. At the time of his death he was Chairman of ANC Sports Enterprises, a leading provider of rotational and LED signage at sports facilities, and was Co-Chairman of Sportsco International which owns the SkyDome stadium in Toronto. Mr. Cohen was involved in numerous charitable endeavors including service as a Trustee or director of Independence House, a facility designed to rehabilitate youthful offenders","excerpt":"Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre; International Center for Photography; Haifa University; American Friends of Hebrew University; Educational Alliance; Columbia College; Columbia Law School; and the Graduate School of Management of The New School. Most recently he served as Chairman of the Columbia Law School Annual Fund and as a director of the American Friends of Tel Aviv University. Among his honors are Columbia University's John Jay Award and election to the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. In 2001, Mr. Cohen was elected to the Board of Directors of the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County. Mr. Cohen is survived by his wife, Carol Cohen, and their daughter Rebecca Cohen. He is also survived by his two children Laurie Cohen Fenster and Gordon Cohen, from his earlier marriage to Joan Fields Cohen, the well-known philanthropist who died in 1989, and by his sister, Beryl Zankel of Boca Raton, FL.

By Ann Head. 261 pp. New York: Doubleday & Co. $3.95."},{"year":"1995","title":"PARALLEL TIME: Growing Up in Black and White By Brent Staples. Avon, $11. The author, an editorial writer for The New York Times, recalls his experiences as the eldest son of a black family in Chester, Pa., a town where obvious forms of segregation had vanished but more subtle divisions between the races were strong. His memoir explores those boundaries and the one between himself and his brother Blake, a drug dealer who died violently. \\"It is a complex portrait of a worldly education, written at times with affection, at times with a sting,\\" Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote here last year.  A BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER By Joan Didion. Vintage International, $12. Charlotte Douglas, a woman with no understanding of revolutions, seeks her 18-year-old daughter, who is trying to foment one. After participating in a bombing and a hijacking, the young woman is believed to be in Boca Grande, a fictional Central American country. Grace Strasser-Mendana, another American expatriate, tells their story. In 1977 our reviewer, Joyce Carol Oates, said that Joan Didion \\"has been an articulate witness to the most stubborn and intractable truths of our time, a memorable voice, partly eulogistic, partly despairing","excerpt":"always in control.\\" Vintage has also brought another of Ms. Didion's novels back into print: DEMOCRACY ($12), in which the author herself is a character. She narrates the drama of the Victor family, whose life in 1975 involves both politics and murder. The author \\"is wonderful not only at hearing her characters but at naming them,\\" Mary McCarthy said in the Book Review in 1984.  LISTENING By Hannah Merker. Harper Perennial, $12. More than two decades ago, the author went skiing for the first time -- an event that marked the last time she would ever hear completely. Her book assesses the importance of sound and demonstrates how she adjusted to the silence imposed by a devastating accident. Writing in these pages last year, Lou Ann Walker said: \\"We feel her loss. . . . But we are receptive to the lessons of listening she is teaching us.\\" Also reissued is TRAIN GO SORRY: Inside a Deaf World, (Vintage, $13). The author, Leah Hager Cohen, is the daughter of the superintendent of the Lexington School for the Deaf in Queens. A hearing child of hearing parents, she describes her life within a culture she could never really be part of. In 1994 our reviewer, Russ Rymer, said the book often reads \\"like a love story -- as intimate, tender and troubling a love story as any you're likely to find.\\"  THE WAY WE KNOW IN DREAMS: Stories By Gordon Weaver. University of Missouri, $14.95. Many of the men in this collection are disappointed middle-aged souls who feel powerless to change their fates -- as well they might, since two of the other characters are God and Satan. The result is \\"inspired, clever and unexpected fiction,\\" Chris Bohjalian wrote here last year. The men in the stories in WANTING ONLY TO BE HEARD, by Jack Driscoll (University of Massachusetts, $12.95), are even more desperate. Frequently hunters and fishermen, often bereft of female company, they live close to nature -- and to violence. In 1993 Jonis Agee said in the Book Review that \\"Jack Driscoll's poetic language gives them a stature that makes their struggle meaningful, tragic and universal.\\"  MOTHERLESS DAUGHTERS: The Legacy of Loss By Hope Edelman. Delta, $12.95. The author, who was 17 when her mother died, draws on clinical research and the experiences of more than 200 other women to analyze the impact of such a loss. Daughters in mourning, she explains, often feel that their own lives are incomplete. This is \\"a moving and valuable treatment of a neglected subject,\\" Nancy Caldwell Sorel said here last year. Maternal roles are also examined in THE MYTHS OF MOTHERHOOD: How Culture Reinvents the Good Mother, by Shari L. Thurer (Penguin, $12.95). Ranging from the Stone Age to today, this history reveals how society, not biology, has defined women's task as parents. In 1994 our reviewer, Rachel Billington, called it \\"positive, sensible and readable.\\"  ACTS OF LOVE By Emily Listfield. Penguin, $10.95. It's a familiar scenario: a gun goes off in a suburban living room, and a marital quarrel ends in death. The question this novel poses is whether Ted Waring deliberately or accidentally killed his estranged wife. The author's \\"chilling meditation . . . is a sobering reminder that some puzzles are better left unsolved,\\" Sarah Ferguson said in the Book Review last year.  THE PROTEAN SELF: Human Resilience in an Age of Fragmentation By Robert Jay Lifton. Basic Books, $13. If a foolish consistency is indeed the hobgoblin of little minds, the author has found quite a few large-minded people. Their response to the dislocation of today's world is to become eminently adaptable. In 1994 our reviewer, Richard A. Shweder, found this \\"a fascinating and appealing book because it is a near-perfect example of an intellectual stance that skeptics sometimes disparage.\\" Human resilience is also evident in THE AGELESS SELF: Sources of Meaning in Late Life, by Sharon R. Kaufman (University of Wisconsin, $11.95). A study of 60 elderly men and women, it demonstrates that strength of spirit and mind often compensates for bodily weakness. It is \\"a book that no novelist or indeed any caring person with a fondness for human interiors could resist,\\" Paul West said here in 1987.  DROWN ALL THE DOGS By Thomas Adcock. Pocket Books, $5.50. Detective Neil Hockaday has to confront his own family's shadowy past when he returns to Ireland to find out about the father he never knew. Last year our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, called this mystery's dialogue \\"lively and literate.\\" LAUREL GRAEBER New & Noteworthy Paperbacks"},{"year":"1966","title":"THE most precious commodity in football is the quarterback and quarterbacks are in such demand that emergency  calls for help often go unanswered.

For the vast majority of these victims, and their families who live a daily funeral, fetal tissue treatment is only a dream.   But there is a drug that has been used safely and effectively to give Alzheimer's victims a useful quality of life. However, the Food and Drug Administration, even after five years of proof that this drug is safe and effective in studies in this country and Britain, rejects it as \\"possibly\\" unsafe and ineffective.

Not that \\"La Finta Giardiniera\\" (\\"The Phony Gardener\\") is a rarity hereabouts just now. Earlier this year the Indiana University School of Music staged the work in the Juilliard Theater as part of the Mozart Bicentennial at Lincoln Center, and early last year the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie of Brussels brought its acclaimed production to the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
