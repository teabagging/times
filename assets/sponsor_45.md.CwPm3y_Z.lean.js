It's the situations the boys get mixed up in that really count, and the best, to our way of thinking, is Harpo's reluctant duel with a Heidelberg-trained swordsman. Gags flow freely, but there isn't one that stuck with us long enough to be set down here. By far the funniest thing in the whole picture is Chico's translation into words of a lengthy and involved warning Harpo delivers in pantomime. As is customary, Chico gets to play the piano and Harpo his harp, but Groucho has stopped chasing voluptuous blondes.

Each of the three men running for the Presidential nomination - former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, Senator Gary Hart and the Rev. Jesse Jackson - has undertaken a major fund-raising effort in New York.   Heading the Mondale fund raising in New York is Robert E. Rubin, 45 years old, a general partner and a member of the policy-making management committee of Goldman, Sachs & Company. Mr. Rubin, whose campaign title is finance chairman for New York, and his associates raised $1.9 million for Mr. Mondale last year, which he said represented more than 20 percent of the total amount contributed throughout the country.   ''I've spent most of my time trying to recruit people who, in turn, would give fund-raising events,'' he said yesterday. His approach, he added, was ''based on the appeal of the guy plus his prospects.'' Mr. Rubin, a lawyer, joined Goldman, Sachs in 1966, became a partner in 1971 and was elected to the 11- member management committee 10 years later.
