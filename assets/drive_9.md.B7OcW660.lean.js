TXT>   Curve's first album, \\"Doppelganger,\\" is an aural deluge: surging, echoing guitars, booming drums and Toni Halliday's voice, breathy and implacable. An avenging siren, Halliday sings about love as siege and obsession. She threatens, \\"Don't step over my head/ 'Cause I will wish you dead\\"; later, she vows, \\"I've come to mess with your head/ It'll make you feel good.\\"    Curve arrives on the trailing edge of a trend, in the wake of British dream-pop bands like My Bloody Valentine, Lush, Ride and others with sanguine female voices amid howling guitars. Halliday and her co-composer, Dean Garcia (bass, guitar, keyboards, drum machines), have been knocking around British rock since the mid-1980's, collaborating on various projects in various styles before releasing Curve's first EP, \\"Blindfold,\\" in 1991.    From the beginning, Curve had figured out its own proportions of structure and sonic chaos and its attitude, guarded and accusatory but never cold. While Garcia and three other band members' guitars crackle and billow and screech, Halliday sings tersely memorable melodies and backup vocals that make pop syllables like \\"ooh-la-la-la\\" seem eerie and seductive. She can sound like Blondie's Deborah Harry, floating unconcerned through the tempest, but she can also bear down until her voice breaks like Sinead O'Connor's leaping wail.   Curve may be a band of opportunists, working variations on a formula. But great rock can emerge where formula meets private visions and demons, and for Curve, the pop end of dream-pop is a magnificent niche. RECORD BRIEFS"},{"year":"1992","title":"How is the glorious pop jazz vocal tradition that runs from Ella Fitzgerald to Doris Day going to be perpetuated? As the generation of singers that reached maturity in the 1940's and 50's heads into its declining years, no one has come along who commands the artistic stature of its finest voices. But there is no dearth of singers who seem eager to carry on the pop-jazz tradition.    Even without a big-band network to nurture talents like those of Miss Fitzgerald and Miss Day, the public appetite for pre-rock music only appears to have increased with the recent success of albums by Linda Ronstadt, Natalie Cole and Harry Connick Jr.  The newest records by singers with their hearts in the 40's and 50's -- Diane Schuur's \\"In Tribute\\" (GRP 2006","excerpt":"cassette and CD) and Mary Cleere Haran's \\"There's a Small Hotel\\" (Columbia 52403; cassette and CD) -- are welcome additions to a steadily growing catalogue of old-fashioned pop albums by singers under the age of 45. Chasing Pop-Jazz's Elusive Spirit"},{"year":"1990","title":"In the tradition-bound world of Broadway theatrical singing, Mandy Patinkin is certainly a revolutionary. Unlike conventional baritones and tenors who perpetuate a heroic pop romanticism, Mr. Patinkin stamps everything he sings with an edgy, high-strung intensity. Instead of treating songs as straightforward statements, he likes to turn them into technical challenges and psychological puzzles. And in doing so, he has introduced a new vocal archetype to Broadway: the sensitive (one might even say hypersensitive) man.    No lyric sentiment is ever taken for granted in Mr. Patinkin's singing. He can take a rudimentary song like \\"Doodle Doo Doo,\\" the 1924 Tin Pan Alley chestnut that opens his second album, \\"Mandy Patinkin -- Dress Casual\\" (CBS FMT/MK 45998","excerpt":"cassette and CD), and turn it into a tense internal dialogue about language, nostalgia, musical diction and the value of simplicity. His natural impulse to treat songs as questions rather than answers makes him one of the greatest interpreters of that master of ambivalence Stephen Sondheim. The centerpiece of \\"Dress Casual\\" is the complete four-song score for Mr. Sondheim's obscure 1966 television musical, \\"Evening Primrose.\\" The Sensitive Side of Broadway"},{"year":"1991","title":"From their self-titled 1978 debut through their new album, \\"On Every Street\\" (Warner Brothers 26680","excerpt":"cassette and CD), Dire Straits have been responsible for some of the prettiest moments in all of rockdom. \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" from their 1980 album \\"Making Movies,\\" tried to answer age-old questions about love with a starry-toned mandolin melody and lines like \\"All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme.\\" The 1982 opus \\"Love Over Gold\\" reconciled violently opposed musical extremes, from a drum beat resounding like thunder to a piano trickling like water in a gutter.   Even the simplest cliches, like the it'll-be-all-right sentiment of \\"Why Worry,\\" from the 1985 megahit \\"Brothers in Arms,\\" were vested with enough emotion to elevate them above the ordinary. Mark Knopfler, the band's lead singer, songwriter, producer and guitar wizard, seemed bent on transforming rock into an idiom capable of near-operatic beauty; Dire Straits albums sounded as though Mr. Knopfler had examined life's great truths under a microscope and wanted to project what he found onto the very heavens above. Dire Straits, Today as Yesterday"},{"year":"1992","title":"At the Farm Aid benefit concert in Dallas last month, the final few hours were reserved for the really big names: Willie Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp, Paul Simon, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Tracy Chapman. As the only woman and the only black performer, Ms. Chapman's inclusion in this elite group seemed impressive. Mr. Nelson, Mr. Young and Mr. Simon, all protest singers in their own way, have each been performing and recording for more than 20 years, while Ms. Chapman's career goes back only four years and two albums.   Introduced by Arlo Guthrie as the most important \\"poet and dreamer of her day,\\" Ms. Chapman took the opportunity to preview material from her third album, \\"Matters of the Heart\\" (Elektra 61215","excerpt":"cassette and CD), due for release this week.

His songs are virtual piles of words: he stacks them one upon another, shoves them together to create unusual images, then shoves the images together to create abstruse sentences. Mr. Costello's lyrics have complete authority over his music: he writes melodies that rise and tumble oddly to keep pace with his verbal spate, and he sometimes extends a melodic phrase when he wants to tag an extra line onto a verse.   On his new album, \\"Mighty Like a Rose\\" (Warner Brothers 26575","excerpt":"cassette and CD), Mr. Costello seems so confident of his prowess as a lyricist that he takes liberties: he draws out the first syllable of \\"mighty\\" to rhyme it with \\"light\\"; he refers to a woman as a \\"sweet pear, sweet pear,\\" repeating the epithet for emphasis. A Word or Two (Or Three) on Love, Death and Insects"},{"year":"1991","title":"The Family Stand is best known as the band behind \\"Ghetto Heaven,\\" one of last year's more soothing dance workouts, and as the songwriting and production team responsible for Paula Abdul's \\"Spellbound.\\" Upon release this month of their third album, \\"Moon in Scorpio\\" (EastWest/Atlantic 91803","excerpt":"cassette and CD), the world may soon see them as they see themselves: as a black rock band. Led by the vocalist Sandra St. Victor, the keyboardist Peter Lord and the multi-intrumentalist V. Jeffrey Smith, all from Brooklyn, the Family Stand has finally made an album that is the full-bodied meltdown of soul, hip-hop and corrosive psychedelia that the first two releases only hinted at. \\n\\nThe song \\"New World Order\\" kicks off side one with a riff-driven rocker that has a manic guitar solo, a free-jazz saxophone break and a lyric that gives a Bronx cheer to what the band perceives as the hypocrisies of Bushspeak. \\"Shades of Blue,\\" the hard-guitar track that follows, is the kind of twisted love call the Rolling Stones used to put over with such conviction, with a vocal by Ms. St. Victor that for lustful torment matches anything laid down by Tina Turner. On \\"You'll Never Be,\\" as on several other of the songs, the lyrics lampoon crossover black artists, especially those who have had nose jobs.

Major labels are signing up blues musicians, independents are stepping up their efforts to promote the blues, and clubs and festivals are thriving. Often, however, \\"the blues\\" has become a catch-all term for blues and Southern soul.   The attention has been good for longtime bluesmen. Buddy Guy, who will perform Oct. 20 at the Beacon Theater (along with John Lee Hooker, as part of the nine-day Benson and Hedges Blues Festival), has made what may be one of the fiercest albums of his career with \\"Damn Right, I've Got the Blues\\" (Silvertone/B.M.G. 1462-JA","excerpt":"cassette and CD). In his voice, rage and pain, despair and belligerence are never far apart, and his guitar style -- wailing sustained notes and salvos of speedy licks -- carries the songs to the brink of hysteria. He makes hard-luck stories hit home on the new album with a pushy band that doesn't let him ease up; even horns and female backup singers egg him on instead of soothing him. The album includes guest stars like the guitarist Jeff Beck, but they fade next to Mr. Guy's fervor. Two Generations, Two Revivals of the Blues"},{"year":"1991","title":"Sometimes you have to destroy a song to save it. Not obliterate it entirely -- just maul it, sandblast it, chew it up around the edges. That's a lesson rock-and-roll periodically learns and forgets and learns again, from the likes of Link Wray (a fuzz-tone pioneer) and Jimi Hendrix and the Velvet Underground and the New York Dolls and Husker Du and Public Enemy: there's nothing like a blast of noise to toughen a lyric, ennoble a melody and make a singer sound trustworthy.    For David Bowie, noise has been as revitalizing as the blood he drank when he played a vampire in \\"The Hunger,\\" and there's plenty of noise on his latest effort, \\"Tin Machine II\\" (Victory Music/PolyGram 311 511 216","excerpt":"cassette and CD). Since the late 1960's, Mr. Bowie's music has oscillated between elaborate theatrical set pieces and noisy rock. His music periodically works itself up to overproduction -- that's when he starts doing the Jacques Brel and Anthony Newley numbers -- until his next project blasts away the contrivances with a guitar assault. David Bowie Makes News With Noise"},{"year":"1983","title":"A sampling of what's new in children's recordings has turned up some winners along with the inevitable assortment of losers and uninspired items appealing, like their counterparts for adults, to the lowest possible common denominator.

All pleasant and instructive enough, no doubt, if you're 1 or 3.   ''Music for 4's, 5's and 6's'' (CMS 693; cassette CMSX 4692) offers more advanced material of the same sort, with original music composed by Donald Ashwander, one of the famous trio of Paper Bag Players (the others are Irving Burton and Judith Martin) who put on a cheery show for little listeners. It features lively, funny songs about daisies, rocks, dandelions and ice cream cones, the liveliest and funniest being a splashy number called ''I Won't Take a Bath.'' CMS also issues two albums in which the affable Tom Glazer performs 32 songs and poems for younger children in ''Happy Rhythms and Rhymes'' (CMS 690; cassette CSX 4690) and in ''Let's Sing Fingerplays,'' the contents of which range from barnyard numbers to traditional spirituals like ''He's Got the Whole World in His Hands.''

Performing material whose music borders on kitsch and whose lyrics and story suggest a verbose soap opera, Miss Peters nevertheless projects an astounding emotional generosity and conviction. Almost singlehandedly she turns the inconsequential erotic misadventures of Emma, an English hat designer pursuing a career in America, into a touching romantic fable about love and its defenses and the loss of innocence.   The album presents the first half -the song half - of the hit show that pairs two separately conceived Andrew Lloyd Webber projects, his 1978 Variations on Paganini's A-minor Caprice and his 1979 song cycle for BBC Television, ''Tell Me on a Sunday.'' In preparing them for the American stage, the director and lyricist Richard Maltby Jr., collaborating with the choreographer Peter Martins, made Variations into a choreographed character sketch of Joe, the Middle Western software salesman who breaks Emma's heart in the first act. Working with Don Black, the show's original lyricist, Mr. Maltby extensively revised and Americanized the lyrics. The show's title now refers not only to the structure of the evening but also serves as a leitmotif for the theme of romantic betrayal - love as ''the same old song and dance.''

It's the long-dominant LP disk format that's becoming an endangered species, while its onetime poor relation, cassettes, prosperously flaunt technological and promotional innovations.\\n\\nThe classical tape repertory still lamentably skimps lieder and avant-garde music, to be sure. And many small producers documenting the activities of regional composers and performers issue disks only, although most major, and many minor, labels offer CD and cassette formats as well. Most notably, cassette reissues, especially those intended for use on portable tape players, mushroom almost as prodigiously as CD's. And in resurrecting past treasures from limbo, they now usually improve on the originals - by skillful remastering, chromium or permium ferric tape, more efficient Dolby noise reduction and reprogrammings that exploit tape's extended-play capabilities.

Sherwood, is credited with the dialogue, this picture, which came to the Rivoli yesterday, is more than slightly wearying. It may have been intended as a human story of marriage, divorce and regrets, but the principal characters are such a vacillating and unnatural lot that it falls wide of such an idea.In an opening scene there are some exaggerated literary types, with a comic poet succeeding in being as much of a bore to those in the theatre as he is to persons to whom he is reciting his compositions. Dudley Crome is presumed to be the only unaffected individual in the party and for that reason Jean Hurd, a bright young mind in the office of Horace Keats, a literary broker, becomes interested in this rational young man. After hearing him talk, one is apt to prefer the chatter of others in the gathering.Subsequently Dudley escorts Jean over to a New Jersey suburb, where he introduces her to Dot and Jeff Aldrich, a young married couple who are proud of their infant. Dot is a gentle soul and her husband is a boor. He prefers to be in his shirt sleeves about the house, and when he is in a bridge game with his wife as his partner, his sighs almost serve her as signals. Jeff suddenly expresses the desire to show Dudley the baby, and although his wife says that as the child is asleep it must not be wakened, the proud father persists in taking his friends upstairs. He has no compunction about turning on a blaze of light and waking his offspring, all of which is more painful than entertaining.Dudley's nature is not precisely sympathetic, but nevertheless Jean finds him compatible. As a husband he is almost as much of a boor as Jeff. Eventually Jean decides to return to work as the partner of Horace Keats and this finally results in a divorce and Dudley's marriage to Sylvia Pearson. In course of time Sylvia presents Dudley with a baby, which, in motion picture tales, is usually a tie that results in the happiness of the parents. But not here, for when Dudley encounters his ex-wife in a theatre he becomes very much interested in her. One would imagine that she had had enough of Dudley, but in the end Sylvia proves to be a sacrificing wife, so glad that she has a child that she is willing to give Dudley back to Jean. Here one can be pardoned for thinking that she is well rid of Dudley, and some spectators may have little sympathy for Jean, who goes about in a woebegone fashion because she has decided that she really loves her ex-husband.If Dudley and Jean were more compatible the story might be effective, but as it is, one loses interest in what happens to them.Edward Everett Horton is supposed to supply a little levity. He does his best as an indolent story agent, but the mere idea of having him constantly dozing on a couch is hardly likely to arouse much mirth. Charles Starrett is out of his element as Dudley. Mary Duncan figures in a minor rôle. \\"Billie Dove plays her part quite well, but even so the character does not ring true. Lois Wilson serves the rôle of Sylvia acceptably.

Like Marsha, the irritable museum employee from episode No. 2 of ''Friends.'' Or the TV panelist next to Michael Moore in ''EDtv.'' (I've been told that those who have heard me deliver the last lines in the movie -- ''I give him six months. He is the macarena.'' -- have said they've come away feeling somehow changed for the better.) But how, you may wonder, did I get these opportunities? This brings me neatly to our topic: the nightmare that is the auditioning process. \\n\\n O.K., I didn't have to audition for my several-line role in ''EDtv.'' But most acting jobs are the result of auditions. And with the exception of showing up for school without your underwear, there is little in the realm of human activity that has the potential to be more humiliating. If applying for jobs in more standard lines of work -- like, say, the telephone company -- were anywhere near as stressful an ordeal, unemployment would remain constant at around 89 percent, while most of the unemployed would spend their days going to therapy.\\n\\n The auditioning process begins its assault on the actor's ego from the moment she or he receives what is referred to as ''the sides.'' These are not onion rings and coleslaw, as you might expect, but pages of dialogue from the script that feature the character for whom the actor is being considered. I remember feeling crestfallen the day that someone sent me a script in which I was asked to read for the part of a mannish gym teacher.

In what has become a rite of passage for every American President since Eisenhower, Bill Clinton is now learning that lesson the hard way. The internal crisis that began less than a month ago with boat hijackings and a riot in Havana has quickly been transformed into a crisis of American foreign and immigration policy, with the United States now forced to provide temporary refuge at places like the Guantanamo Bay naval base for the more than 16,000 disenchanted Cubans intercepted as they headed for Florida aboard rickety rafts.

Free Choices    TODAY Joined by Dennis Joseph, clarinetist, the Long Island String Quartet performs three clarinet quintets, including Osvaldo Golijov's ''Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind for Klezmer Clarinet and String Quartet'' at 2:30 P.M. in the Rehearsal Hall of the Southampton Building on the Selden campus of Suffolk Community College. Mozart's Clarinet Quintet in A and Brahms's Clarinet Quintet complete the program (451-4163).    TOMORROW As the keynote speaker at Adelphi University's African-American Solidarity Day, Brent Staples, a member of the New York Times editorial board, discusses ''Race, Violence and American Society'' at 8 P.M. in the University Center Ballroom in Garden City  (877-4980).    SATURDAY Old Westbury Gardens and Westbury House, the mansion on the onetime John S. Phipps 150-acre estate, will be open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. weekends through Nov. 22. Visitors may take in the formal gardens and landscaped grounds with woodlands, ponds and lakes; tour the Charles II-style house, and join in the special activities without paying the usual admission (333-0048).    At the Libraries    The library concert circuit today includes everything from a recital of French music by Mark Barton, flutist, and Doris Anne McMullen, pianist, at 3 P.M. at the South Country Library in Bellport (286-0818), to rock-and-roll from the 1950's provided by Mike Moc and His Big 5 at 2 P.M. at the Long Beach Library (432-7201). The singer Terri Kerins performs ''From Opera to Broadway'' at 2 P.M. at the Oceanside Library (766-2360), and the Andrea del Danza Espana Company comes to the Port Washington Library at 3 P.M. (883-7927). The Long Island Composers Alliance offers ''Love Duets'' at 2:30 P.M. at the Bryant Library in Roslyn (621-2240).    During the week, the lineup features a lecture, ''Scandal: Media, Politics and American Values,'' at 11:30 A.M. Tuesday at the Shelter Rock Library in Albertson  (248-7363); a talk on ''The Book of Spanish Jewry, 711 to 1492,'' at 8 P.M. Wednesday at the Freeport Library (379-3274), and also on Wednesday, but at the Lindenhurst Library, an antiques appraisal session at 7 P.M. (957-7755).    'Tricky Tales'    Last year, the Southampton Chamber Music Festival commissioned Susan Kander, a composer who had recently completed children's operas for the Kansas City Lyric Opera and the Opera Thater of St. Louis , to create a work that would add to the limited concert repertory for youngsters. Ms. Kander has come up with ''Two Tricky Tales,'' which has its world premiere today at 3 P.M. at the Cutchogue Presbyterian Church on Main Road. Scored for trumpet, clarinet, bass clarinet, violin, cello, percussion and narrator, the work, described as employing ''jazzy and celestial music,'' is based on two folk stories involving tricksters of different cutures. In one, Hermes tricks Apollo and creates the first lyre, while the other features Brer Rabbit from an African-American folk tale. The concert starts with a demonstration of the instruments and will be followed by a reception. Youngsters will be admitted free (298-5097).    'New Faces'    Tilles Center's ''New Faces'' series, this year devoted exclusively to young keyboard artists, opens today with Terrence Wilson. Mr. Wilson made his debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra and has since appeared with other prestigeous ensembles in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, St. Louis and San Francisco; in the 1995-96 season, he made his recital debut at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan and the Kennedy Center in Washington. Mr. Wilson plays the Bach/Busoni ''Chaconne,'' Beethoven's Sonata (Op. 111), Debussy's Three Preludes and Barber's Sonata in the Hillwood Recital Hall on the C. W. Post campus in Brookville at 3 P.M. Completing the ''Three Young Virtuosos of the Keyboard'' series are Reiko Aizawa on Feb. 28 and Jan Gottlieb Jiracek on April 11 (229-3100).    Holocaust Drama    While most community theater groups fill their seasons with tried-and-true musicals, comedies and familiar dramas, the Synergy Ensemble Theater Company in Islip likes to take chances with offbeat and frequently provocative fare. ''There are enough places out here doing musicals,'' said Bill Sellman, who is on the company's management committee, ''so we can do something more challenging, especially since we're underwritten by Islip and don't have to sell 300 tickets to every performance.'' In past three-production seasons, Synergy has offered plays like A. R. Gurney's ''Old Boy,'' which has a gay theme, and ''Down the Road,'' Lee Blessing's drama about a serial killer.    Diane Samuels's ''Kindertrans port'' fills the bill, and on Friday the company opens a six-performance, three-weekend run of the drama about a daughter's discovery that her mother was a Jew who escaped from Nazi Germany. The play made its debut in London in 1993 and was presented by the Manhattan Theater Club in 1994. Synergy performs at Town Hall West on Main Street in Islip (864-1070).    Sinatra Conference Preview    In a kind of preview of things to come on Nov. 12, when Hofstra University opens its three-day conference ''Frank Sinatra: The Man, the Music, the Legend,'' Tom Postilio, the cabaret singer, appears in ''At Long Last Love: The Songs of Sinatra'' on Friday at the universiy. Mr. Postilio, currently performing at the Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan, readily acknowledges the debt he owes Sinatra. ''Ever since I was about 12 and my parents took me to Carnegie Hall to hear him, he has been an incredible influence on me,'' said Mr. Postilio, 27, who grew up in Hauppague. ''I was so hit by listening to him -- by his stage presence, his sound -- that I immediately dug into my parents' record collection, and he's been with me ever since.''    Mr. Postilio has been performing professionally since he was 19. He has appeared as the featured singer with the Glenn Miller Band, played cabaret venues like the Rainbow Room and the Supper Club in Manhattan, as well as hotels in Las Vegas and Atlantic City; been singled out with awards from the Manhattan Association of Cabarets and Clubs, and recently released a new album, ''Dream,'' on the DRG label.    The concert, for which Mr. Postilio will be backed by the John Oddo Trio, is at 8 P.M. in the Monroe Lecture Center Theater on Hofstra's Hempstead campus (463-5669).    Chamber Music Premieres    With three world premieres in the offing, Four Winds and a Horn performs on Saturday at 8 P.M. at the Hays Theater on the Rockville Centre campus of Molloy College. The new pieces, on a program that includes works by Dvorak and Mozart, are ''Winter Upon Us,'' the third of a cycle of four woodwind quintets by Jerry Rizzi based on the seasons, and two woodwind quintets by Jerome Roth. The ensemble, consisting of Marie Schwartz, flutist, and Nancy Daniels, clarinetist its founders; Suzanne Stein, oboist; Florence Stadtlander, bassoonist, and Michael Herzlin, French hornist, has been in residence with the Rockville Centre Guild for the Arts since 1996  (678-5658).

Players Association for salaries due members of last season's team. At the bottom line is this: All of the franchise's players are now free agents, and that includes Marcus Dupree, who bolted the University of Oklahoma as a sensational sophomore  running back and later signed a five-year, $6 million contract with the Breakers in 1984, when they were based in New Orleans. Dupree's contractual freedom may be moot, though, because, back home in Philadelphia, Miss., he is still slowly rehabilitating a knee that was severely damaged in the opening game of 1985. ''If it is a career-ending injury,'' says Jack Galmiche, the Breakers'  president, ''Marcus will collect the remainder of his contract from Lloyd's of London.'' And if it is not, then Dupree has his sights set on the National Football League. Though not eligible for the N.F.L. draft until 1987, he would likely petition the league to accept him next year.         * Roy Martin is the sprinter from Roosevelt High in Dallas who last spring set national schoolboy records in the 100-meter dash (10.18 seconds) and in the  200 (20 seconds flat). Now he is enrolled at Southern Methodist University and working two to three hours daily in preparation for the indoor season, which begins in mid-January. ''We're gearing him to run 200 meters outdoors,'' says Ralph White, S.M.U.'s dash coach. ''With that in mind, as well as racing in indoor dashes he'll try an occasional 500-meter run, but not so many as to affect his stride. He's working hard on technique and getting off to faster starts than he did in high school.'' If those starts get very much faster, then  he ought to be something to see. Ted McLaughlin, the Mustangs' head coach, was justifiably awed when, in recruiting him, he described Martin as ''the greatest  high school sprinter of all time.''

Greg (Boo) Harvey, the guard from Andrew Jackson in Queens whose grade-point average didn't measure up, will follow in Walter Berry's footsteps and attend San Jacinto, the junior-college basketball power in Texas. Gary Massey, a forward from St. Raymond in the Bronx, signed during the early commitment period last fall with Villanova, where he will be joined by Kenny Wilson, a guard from St. Anthony's in Jersey City. Still undecided are Darryl Walker, a forward from All Hallows in the Bronx, who is considering Seton Hall, Iona, Missouri and Wichita State, and Marco Baldi, the 6-11 center who played at Long Island Lutheran.

''It's also unmatched in its ability to be compacted without losing resiliency, so you would have to say we have no synthetic fibers that will outperform Mother Nature in every respect.''   One way to insulate is to reflect heat back toward the body creating it.

Even so, who would have guessed that Roger Vadim, working from a screen play by Jean Anouilh, no less, would come up with such a total debacle?His dubbed \\"Circle of Love,\\" which rode a crest of exploitation yesterday into the DeMille, Coronet and theaters all over town, is a dull, pointless, ineptly acted vulgarization of a distinguished play, with nothing to recommend it beyond some attractive color photography by Henri Decae.Of course, Mr. Vadim has never been Max Ophuls. His talents were always sensational rather than subtle, and his broad close-up technique has none of the master's dexterous style. Setting his fable, unimaginatively enough, in 1914 Paris instead of old Vienna, he does not even attempt to challenge the late German director's conception, which linked past to present through an impressionistic carousel, supervised by the supremely elegant entrepreneur of Anton Walbrook.Not only is Mr. Walbrook regrettably absent, but so are Danielle Darrieux, Gerard Philipe, Simone Simon, Jean-Louis Barrault, Isa Miranda, Fernand Gravey and Simone Signoret. Asking any group of contemporary youngsters to compete with that line-up would be grossly unfair but the present assembly does seem unduly dispirited. Or perhaps it is merely the way they screech at each other over the dubbed sound track, in the most ear-piercing accents since the heyday of the Jeanette MacDonald-Nelson Eddy operettas.The only tolerable voice in the collection belongs to Jane Fonda, who uses her own—though it has no relationship to her lip movements, since she played the part in French. Wildly miscast as the discreet and timid matron, the part Miss Darrieux made hers for life, the improving Miss Fonda plays against type. With some comic skill, she creates a perverse imp who speaks modestly while her gestures and expression pointedly belie her words.In the film's most diverting episode, Miss Fonda cavorts in bed with the student, Jean-Claude Brialy—where, despite those billboards, she remains strategically covered by a sheet at all times. The actor is the most accomplished of the males in Mr. Vadim's circle of love, also doing nicely opposite Anna Karina's hard-working (but, alas, Brooklyn-accented) house-maid.The rest are a sad lot, and after Miss Fonda's early exit the film careers violently downhill. Maurice Ronet's husband is a caricature","excerpt":"Catherine Spaak's midinette is surly; Bernard Noel is a hammy playwright; Francine Berg a lurid actress, Jean Sorel a callow count. Marie Dubois and Claude Giraud, the prostitute and soldier of the opening, are the most tire-some of the bunch.Tedium, in fact, rules the day in Mr. Vadim's crude approach. His lovers are neither attractive nor romantic, and his minute examination of their passionless lovemaking is startlingly ugly. As for Mr. Anouilh's jaded dialogue—well, let us be kind to a major playwright, and assume that this must be a very free translation.
