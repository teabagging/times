The assault comes in the form of a suit alleging that the trustees of the foundation, a world-renowned institution in Merion, Pa., that has a priceless collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art, have taken advantage of the foundation's assets. The suit was filed by the De Mazia Trust, which was established by Violette de Mazia, a protegee and close companion of the founder, Dr. Albert C. Barnes. Miss de Mazia, who died four years ago, was a driving force in the institution, which she served as a vice president and the education director.   The Barnes Foundation, established in 1922 by Barnes, a patent-medicine manufacturer, to perpetuate his art collection and his ideas about art education, has always been considered an eccentric, exclusive institution. Barnes, for example, was well known for refusing to allow important collectors like Walter P. Chrysler Jr. and distinguished scholars like Meyer Schapiro and Kenneth Clark to see any of his estimated 800 paintings and 200 sculptures. Before his death in 1951, the founder made another unusual decision: he gave Lincoln University -- a small, predominantly black college 45 miles west of Merion with no track record in art education -- the power to nominate the trustees of the Barnes Foundation.    Both the foundation and its trustees made news last May when a lucrative contract was signed with Alfred A. Knopf to publish for the first time color photographs of the foundation's collection. The holdings include 170 Renoirs, 55 Cezannes and 20 Picassos. The deal was signed a month after the Newhouse Foundation made a $2 million donation to Lincoln University. The head of the Newhouse Foundation, and the son of its founder, is S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of the corporation that owns Knopf.   In its petition filed on Jan. 21 in Montgomery County, Pa., the De Mazia Trust charges that the Barnes trustees used the catalogue contract as a lure for the donation to Lincoln University. (Three out of the five trustees of the Barnes Foundation are also on the board of Lincoln University, and the fourth, Richard H. Glanton, the president, is the university's general counsel.) The donation, they say, should have gone directly to the Barnes Foundation, which owns the artwork to be catalogued. The De Mazia Trust contends that because of the contribution to Lincoln, the Barnes trustees dismissed bids made by other publishers. They say other publishers would have given the foundation a contribution of several million dollars but that their efforts were ignored.    Mr. Glanton's response was: \\"That's not true. We had four serious proposals. We asked each publisher for a minimum of a $500,000 advance and only one publisher met our request.\\" He added that Harry N. Abrams, the New York-based publisher, submitted the \\"second best\\" proposal.    But Paul Gottlieb, the president and publisher of Abrams, denies this. \\"The Barnes Foundation had no idea what they would have gotten out of us,\\" said Mr. Gottlieb.    Mr. Glanton said on Wednesday that Knopf had awarded the Barnes Foundation a $750,000 advance for publishing the collection, a sum Mr. Gottlieb called \\"staggering\\" for an art book. He added, \\"I don't really believe that's what the advance is.\\"   According to Susan D. Ralston, the editor of the catalogue at Knopf, \\"$750,000 is an erroneous figure.\\"   \\"The real amount is a private matter between the Barnes Foundation and Knopf,\\" Mrs. Ralston said, adding that the contract was for two books. The first book, a selection of the Barnes Foundation's great works, is to be in bookstores by the fall of 1993. While Mrs. Ralston said that no writer had been decided on, a name that keeps surfacing is that of J. Carter Brown, the director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Mr. Brown announced his resignation last week but is to remain in the post through this year. The second part of the contract is a catalogue raisonne that may be published in more than one volume. Consulting with the Barnes Foundation on the selection of art are several institutions, including the National Gallery, the French National Museums and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.    After the suit concerning the book contract was filed in Montgomery County Orphans' Court by the De Mazia Trust, the Barnes Foundation asked the court to withdraw a petition it made in March to ease visiting-hour restrictions, change investment policies, raise admission fees and allow the building to be used for social functions. But last week Louis D. Stefan, a Montgomery County judge, refused to let the foundation withdraw its suit. Instead, the judge asked the trustees to produce the foundation's financial documents as well as minutes of its board meetings.   \\"The Attorney General also opposed the request to withdraw the petition,\\" said Judge Stefan in a telephone interview. \\"He wants to enable the court to look into the allegations raised by the De Mazia Trust and to resolve the serious issues currently being raised.\\" Judge Stefan said that a hearing was tentatively scheduled for March.    Mr. Glanton called the allegations in the suit \\"very regrettable,\\" and said the foundation's books and records would be open to the court.   The de Mazia suit is the most explosive challenge to the Glanton-led board of the Barnes Foundation. It clearly draws the line between the trustees, who want change, and Barnes loyalists, who would like to preserve the status quo. The De Mazia Trust, along with a group of past and present students, is committed to preserving the 70-year-old foundation's emphasis on art education. The trustees say they are trying to modernize the foundation and make its outstanding but little-known art collection available to a wider audience.    The trustees made their first move in this direction in April, when they petitioned the court for permission to sell up to 15 paintings from their collection to raise what they said was a badly needed $15 million to modernize the deteriorating galleries and to supplement the $10 million endowment that now generates only $1 million annually for operating costs. (It is normal museum practice to sell works of art only to acquire other art, not to use the proceeds for operating costs.) But three months later, the foundation changed its mind, citing adverse publicity as the reason for deciding not to sell works from its collection.    Meanwhile, the board is considering other options that would go against the very strict indenture set up by the foundation's creator. Among the prohibitions laid down by the irascible Dr. Barnes was a stipulation that the collection may never be moved from the present 1926 building that houses the artworks. But the trustees would like to close the museum for renovations and send the collection on tour to other museums like the National Gallery of Art. \\"It is one of the options under consideration,\\" Mr. Glanton said. \\"But I cannot really comment any further.\\"  A Shrinking Whitney    The Whitney Museum of American Art is losing two of its three Manhattan branches. It has been asked to vacate by August its first-floor gallery in the Equitable Center, at Seventh Avenue and 52d Street, where the museum has been holding exhibitions for the last six years. By the end of September, the space at 33 Maiden Lane, which has housed the Whitney's downtown gallery since 1988, will be transformed into an I.B.M. marketing and education center.   \\"It's another sign of the times,\\" said David A. Ross, the director of the Whitney. \\"These branches were a way of keeping more of our collection on view.\\" Mr. Ross also pointed out that the timing for the closings was particularly bad since the museum's expansion plans have been postponed until the economy picks up.    Since their inception, the branches have always been well attended. During fiscal year 1991, for example, 40,000 people visited the Whitney's downtown branch","excerpt":"about 100,000 passed through the Equitable Center branch. \\"The branches fulfilled an important purpose,\\" said Mr. Ross. \\"The Whitney has about 10,000 works of art in its collection and even when the entire third and fourth floors are used, there may only be about 200 artworks in an installation. Without these branches, fewer people will have a chance to see the depth of of our collection.\\"   In financial terms, Mr. Ross said, these branches were neither a drain nor an income producer. Admission to all of the Whitney's branches are free and corporations like Equitable Life Assurance, International Business Machines and Park Tower Realty financed their operating costs.    Equitable, as well as I.B.M. and Park Tower Realty, which jointly own the building on Maiden Lane, said each company would continue to give the museum financial support, as they have in the past. But each corporation had different reasons for closing its branch of the Whitney: at Equitable, Mary Mannarino, the manager of public relations, said the company had decided to \\"support a wider number of institutions who would benefit from the good location.\\" Ms. Mannarino also explained that Equitable would not be making any public announcement about future exhibitions until the spring.   At the Whitney's Maiden Lane location, an award-winning space designed by the New York architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, Paul Neuman, a media spokesman for I.B.M., said the decision to close the gallery wasn't an easy one since they were losing a mini-landmark. \\"We are downsizing and shrinking our real-estate holdings,\\" he said. \\"We simply needed the space.\\" Meanwhile, Park Tower Realty, in an effort to continue its association with the museum, is planning to help the Whitney find a new location. \\"We haven't actually begun the search,\\" said Kate Coburn, Park Tower's director of marketing. \\"But we will be finding the Whitney a new downtown home.\\"   The Art Market"},{"year":"1971","title":"TOKYO, Nov. 24 (Reuters)&#8212","excerpt":"About 100,000 people demonstrated throughout Japan today to protest against the lower house's approval of an agreement to return Okinawa to Japanese rule. 100,000 Stage Protest"},{"year":"1975","title":"article on life in Beirut, Lebanon, as warring gangs slide into another cycle of violence","excerpt":"about 100,000 people have been thrown out of work by paralysis of commercial life; 2/3 of GNP is reptd to have been lost in 7 mos of violence; some people do not have enough to eat; shakedowns and protection are integral part of what purports to be pol struggle; robbery is spreading fast; crime and looting have spread into diplomatic qr; in addition to fundamental Moslem-Christian confrontation, dissent is spreading in 2 major communities and it has become virtually impossible to know who is killing whom on given day; Dr Mounir Shamma, Greek Orthodox who is leader of new nonreligious group called Natl Salvation Front, comments (L) Civilized Way of Life A Casualty in Beirut"},{"year":"1976","title":"GENEVA.

In 1892 the British established a protectorate over the Gilbert Islands, inhabited principally by Micronesians. In 1915 Britain joined the islands administratively with the Polynesian-speaking Ellice Islands to the south to form a British colony, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands (later expanded to include other islands). The Japanese occupied the Gilberts in 1942; in 1943 the Allied forces recaptured them, and Tarawa was the scene of some of the fiercest combat in the Pacific. In 1971 Britain granted the colony self-rule. The Ellice Islands broke away in 1975, becoming the independent nation of Tuvalu in 1978. On July 12, 1979, the Gilbert Islands became independent as Kiribati. United States claims to portions of the Line and Phoenix islands were settled by a friendship treaty in 1979. Kiribati's economy is based on subsistence farming and on fishing. Copra exports and the sale of fishing rights (principally to Japan) are the main earners of hard currency.

By Philip Mattera. (Addison-Wesley, $19.95.) Ronald Reagan got himself elected President in 1980 by asking Americans if they were better off than they had been four years earlier. The wonder is that after the subsequent two terms of radical, greed-driven economic policy -- Philip Mattera calls it a coup d'etat born of an unprecedented alliance of business, the Federal Government and the political right -- George Bush was able to convince American voters they were a prosperous lot. \\"Prosperity Lost\\" meticulously chronicles the downward plunge in the American standard of living, mostly during the Reagan years, an erosion that affects all but the wealthiest among us. Median income in 1987 was $30,853, just $33 above the adjusted 1973 figure. Meanwhile, real estate prices soared -- making the 1980's the first postwar decade in which home ownership rates declined. Many who can afford to buy homes emulate an unnamed southern California employee of a defense contractor mentioned by Mr. Mattera who sleeps in his car several nights a week instead of making the two-hour commute to an affordable home. The cost of a private college education rose by 50 percent in the 1980's (public college costs went up by about 33 percent), partly as a result of the colleges picking up the slack from cuts in Federal student aid. As manufacturing jobs have diminished, high-paid union workers have no option but to take low-paying, low-benefits service-industry jobs -- or even to become part of the contingency work force of short-timers, temps or sub-minimum-wage homeworkers. One result: some 31 million Americans are without any form of health insurance","excerpt":"about 40 percent of those who work are not included in employment-based health insurance. To support these endless statistics, Mr. Mattera, a former reporter for Fortune, includes anecdotes, many of them drawn from Congressional testimony, so the effect of \\"Prosperity Lost\\" is a rude awakening from the American dream. The major culprits: two Republican Administrations and big business. As his Administration was cutting housing subsidies, Mr. Mattera charges, Mr. Reagan was portraying homelessness as an unfortunate side effect of deinstitutionalization. Meanwhile, corporations were demanding wage concessions from labor unions that even some businessmen publicly admitted were unnecessary. Mr. Mattera calls for a return to the days when the Government better addressed the social needs of its citizens with average and below-average incomes and kept business in line.

Specifically, I want to talk about taxes","excerpt":"about what we must do as a nation this year to transform a system that's become an endless source of confusion and resentment into one that is clear, simple and fair for all; a tax code that no longer runs roughshod over Main Street America, but insures your families and firms incentives and rewards for hard work and risk-taking in an American future of strong economic growth.   No other issue goes so directly to the heart of our economic life; no other issue will have more lasting impact on the well-being of your families and your future.   In 1981 our critics charged that letting you keep more of your earnings would trigger an inflationary explosion, send interest rates soaring and destroy our economy. Well, we cut your tax rates anyway by nearly 25 percent. And what that helped trigger was falling inflation, falling interest rates and the strongest economic expansion in 30 years.

In fact, this Russo-German production of French life dawdles along from Blonn, an imaginary French town, to a French penal island, then back again to France, into a coal mine disaster","excerpt":"about which time one despairs almost of there being such a thing as an end to the story. The producers seem reluctant to let their Erik Ward go.There has been a great deal of work entailed in making this picture, hut the director could have saved both money and effort if only occasionally he had insisted on the players going about their work in a more natural manner. Sometimes, even with Jean Murat, who plays Erik Ward, it is not easy to tell from his countenance whether he is repressing disappointment or joy. Of course, one knows from the title and innuendoes that the young man is doomed for a variety of adventures before he can marry the charming dark-haired woman. At the opening of the story she is the husband of a blackguard, who is killed in a fight with Ward. Toward the end of the yarn the Minister of Justice avers that the penalty was extreme in Ward's case. One might say that it was merely an excuse to prolong the story and give some rather good scenes of the unfortunate Mr. Ward on the prison island and subsequently to show incidents of his escape. It seemed rather as though he ought to have been congratulated for his attitude in the fight, as he is later for his courage in saying men who have been imprisoned in a coal mine.Like most melodramas, this particular specimen is filled with coincidences. The bureaucracy have long memories, and the police are quick on the job, coming to the place where Ward and the woman are beheld in each other's arms a moment or so after the escaped convict arrives.Countess Agnes von Esterhazy, a Hungarian actress, plays the leading female rôle. Some might say that she is not suited for motion picture work, but she is good looking in a calm, sedate way and does very well with her part.Far more interesting than this long feature is a shorter foreign film called \\"Premeditations.\\" This aroused interest the instant it came to the screen, and what enhances its value is the fact that it was written and directed by E. C. Paton, who also plays all the male rôles. It shows the thoughts of certain individuals. There is, for instance, the avaricious elderly man who is plotting to poison a child so as to get the money bequeathed her. Then come the mental activities of a man who contemplates burglary. He happens to be looking in at the window of the individual who is thinking of poison, and a short distance away, also outside the house, is an agent de police watching the would-be burglar. The agent de police is rolling over in his mind the chances of winning a Legion of Honor if he acts at the psychological moment. So you have avarice, theft and glory in contemplative form.This \\"Premeditations\\" is one of those rare films that grip one so soon as the characters appear.

The movement, whether rooted in myth or fact, has endured as a signature style of modern painting. And with its great chameleonlike variety, it is able to express a range of notions from decorative ones to ontological. It can question the essence of being, as is borne out by several works in an engaging group exhibition, \\"Abstract Expressionism: An Ongoing Legacy,\\" at the Gallery at Hastings-on-Hudson, featuring the work of 12 contemporary practitioners.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art's \\"Abstract Expressionism: Works on Paper,\\" an exhibition drawn entirely from the museum's own collection, is so full of intimate, small-scale incident that it suggests a different sensibility altogether, one in which a supposed compulsion for self-expression is tempered by a concern for nature, for non-Western art, and for the emotional impact of sheer formal beauty.    Not that the old view is entirely wrong. Of the show's 19 artists, only two are women, and a few of the works included are aggressive in the extreme. Among them is a pair of Willem de Kooning's images of women done in oils. One dated 1950 is spiky and keen, the woman's smiling mouth cut from a cigarette ad. The other, from 1966, is a weird Rubenesque knot of blood-red and flesh-pink. Disturbingly, it suggests a kind of slashing sexual martyrdom and shows how Mr. de Kooning, uniquely among his peers at this period, found a metaphor for carnality in paint.
