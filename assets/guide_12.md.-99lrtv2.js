ROGER GRANET                    . . .         It was one of the city's more enchanted evenings, with some 6,000 music lovers, including a tot or two, filling the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and spilling out on the lawn, to hear Kurt Masur conduct the New York Philharmonic in a free performance of Mahler's Symphony No. 9. It was one of those all-too-infrequent occasions when one would not have lived in any other town.   But even the most diehard Mahler-ites allowed themselves to be pleasantly distracted by the pajama-clad lad of 2 or so sitting attentively alongside his young dad who conducted silently from his seat, a smile on his face, an occasional whisper-finger to his lips. When he conducted gently, his son did likewise. When he used more aggressive movements, the youngster was equally enthusiastic.    Such shared delight between father and son did not go unnoticed by their neighbors. When at the conclusion of the second movement, the youngster left with a young woman, all nearby eyes were on Dad, who realized an explanation was in order.   \\"Oh,\\" he said. \\"He really only likes the first two movements.\\"                    . . .

I'm in my 20's and it was no small task to gear my routine to a group with an average age of, say, 85. They seemed to like me; only a few fell asleep. After my act, a woman -- probably in her 90's -- approached me. \\"You, come here,\\" she demanded, much as my grandmother does when she wants attention.   Who was I to argue? A fan's a fan.   \\"You're the comic, right?\\"   I nodded proudly.   \\"Well, I want you to know that I saw Milton Berle when he was your age.\\"   \\"Yeah . . . wow!\\" I gasped in mock sincerity.   \\"Yes,\\" she snapped. \\"And he was no good either.

Rhee and her boyfriend are strolling along Broadway. On the block between 73d and 74th Streets, Ms. Rhee sees a father carrying his daughter, about 4, atop his shoulders. The girl is adorable, with white-blond hair and a silliness that reminds Ms. Rhee of herself when she was young.   Unbeknownst to her father, the girl is forming rabbit ears with her fingers on top of his head. When she sees that Ms. Rhee has discovered her secret, she gestures \\"shhh\\" with her other hand.

They are made tochase madly and shamelessly after a character, played by Alain Delon, who is supposed to be thoroughly fascinating, but, for our francs, is not.This young man, whom some genius press agent has helpfully tagged \\"the French James Dean,\\" has long, silky hair, high cheekbones and a loose-jointed, soigné air. In close-ups (of which there are many), he smiles come-hitherly and generally is condescending towards the lovelies, who simply flip for him. He rides a motorcycle and affects the hauteur of a \\"cat.\\" Under Michel Boisrond's intense direction, he is intensely the focus of the show.But the point is too labored and obvious. The impression soon sets in that this is primarily an effort to promote a new glamour boy. And the fact that the rest of the picture, the story and dialogue, lacks subtlety and wit—is, indeed, downright foolish in its pretense of male attractiveness—finishes it.There are other annoying aspects. It is apparent that producer Paul Graetz and M. Boisrond, the director, have endeavored to pump some cheap eroticism into it. There is a swimming-pool scene, full of young folk as near nudist as the law allows, which contains some rather seamy shenanigans between the hero and a newly married girl. And there is another scene in which the hero is pounced upon by the three dames and given such a rough-housing as might worry the circumspect.Fortunately, the girls are fetching. Mylene Demonget is perhaps the most wholesome-looking and impressive. She is the beautiful blonde who was last seen here in \\"Witches of Salem.\\" She's got the reach and everything on M. Delon. Pascale Petit is what her name says—a skinny little thing with a gamin air. She plays the girl, newly married, who still is a moth for her former flame. Jacqueline Sassard is the spiritual one, a plainly precocious convent girl who is led into mischief and expulsion by the hero's ineffable charm.Obviously, all three of these young ladies are stronger than M. Delon. It is tiresome to see them wasting their strength on the likes of this film.There are English subtitles, but they are no brighter than the script.
