The original stadium opened in 1923, as 74,200 fans packed the massive three-tiered facility and watched Babe Ruth christen his new home with a towering shot as the Yankees beat their hated rivals, the Boston Red Sox. Because Ruth was such a tremendous draw, Yankee Stadium almost immediately acquired its moniker, \\"The House that Ruth Built.\\" The park was remodeled and scaled down slightly in the mid-70's, but historic touches remain, including Monument Park and the decorative white colonnade above the outfield. Some of baseball's most legendary names have played at the Stadium, including Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle, to name but a few. It was here that Gehrig delivered his famous farewell address (\\"Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth\\"), and here that three perfect games have been hurled (by Don Larsen, David Wells and David Cone).

The owner of our apartment, the former building owner, refuses to pay for repairs, claiming that the co-op management should pay. Meanwhile, the superintendent says it's our responsibility. Who should pay and how does one get them to pay? . . . Herbert Stessin, Manhattan  Answer: Your dispute is probably with your shareholding landlord, and you have recourse to the courts and state regulators. Michael R. Finder, a Manhattan housing lawyer, said a co-op's lease usually provides that repairs within a unit, such as a leaky faucet, are the owner's responsibility and that structural repairs, such as a leaky roof, are management's.    If a written request fails to get action from your landlord, you can file a complaint with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal at its borough office, 240-6010. Mr. Finder said your other options are to sue the landlord in the housing division of City Civil Court or to withhold your rent and raise the repair issue when the landlord sues you for nonpayment. A lawyer is not required for housing court","excerpt":"call its borough office at 374-2212 for information.  Electrical Outlets  Question: Is the landlord required to provide grounded three-pronged electrical outlets in an older apartment building in New York City? Would the cost of converting the outlets be the tenant's responsibility? Is it lawful to use adapters on refrigerator and air-conditioner plugs to fit the older style electrical outlets? . . . J.Sussman, Manhattan  Answer: Landlords are not required to provide three-pronged outlets in pre-1967 buildings. That year the city's code was amended to require grounded outlets in new construction, according to Vahe Tiryakian, spokesman for New York City's Buildings Department. All post-1967 buildings should have the grounded outlets.    If a Buildings Department inspection found a code violation, Mr. Tiryakian said, the owner would be ordered to comply. Housing lawyers say the cost of compliance is the owner's, not the tenant's, responsibility.    Adapters are widely used for plugs on modern appliances in pre-1967 buildings lacking three-pronged outlets. But Mr. Tiryakian said such adapters are not approved by the city's code.  Late-Payment Penalties  Question: The landlord notified all tenants of our rent-stabilized apartment building as follows: Rent is due the first of each month. Rent received after the fifth day will be subject to a $20 late charge. If the rent is not paid within 10 days, the tenant will be served with eviction papers. Proceedings will not be discontinued unless legal fees are paid. Is this legal? . . . Herman Marak, Elmhurst, Queens  Answer: Maybe. The first issue is whether your lease provides for a late penalty, according to Michael B. Rosenblatt, chairman of the Enforcement Bureau's Co-operative and Condominium Committee in the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. If the lease allows a penalty, the next question is whether the amount is reasonable. The $20 appears to meet that test.    As for the threatened eviction, Mr. Rosenblatt said that landlords are entitled to invoke such proceedings in cases of unpaid rent, but that imposing legal fees on the tenant is for a court, not the landlord, to decide.

This new, extensively rewritten version of the 1955 play by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, as adapted by Wendy Kesselman and directed by James Lapine, offers no treacly consolations about the triumph of the spirit. Indeed, with Natalie Portman's luminous Anne at the show's center, the effect is like watching an exquisite fawn through the lens of a hunter's rifle. An uncompromising steadiness of gaze that never forgets the human darkness waiting to claim this work's incandescently human heroine is accordingly the strongest element here. It's undeniably moving, with beautifully drawn, organic-seeming moments throughout. Yet the actors, who include Linda Lavin and George Hearn, don't always project the sense of a unified ensemble; it's as if they have set their performances to different metronomes. Clear, honorable and workmanlike, this ''Anne Frank'' doesn't achieve greatness in itself. But it doesn't diminish the magnitude of the events behind it. And the horror of its central situation, and the natural dramatic tightness it lends itself to, continue to hold the attention with an iron clamp (2:20).

Yeltsin moved quickly today to try to calm Russians and restore confidence in his Government after Tuesday's extraordinary and embarrassing run on the ruble, which lost more than 25 percent of its value against the dollar.   While the financial elements to stop the plunge were put into place Tuesday night -- helping the ruble to recover today to 3,736 against the dollar from Tuesday's close of 3,926 -- Mr. Yeltsin also moved politically. He dismissed the acting Finance Minister, Sergei Dubinin, who had little responsiblity for the run on the ruble","excerpt":"called the Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, home from vacation, and asked Parliament to dismiss the head of the central bank, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, a long-time target of market-oriented reformers.   Parliament postponed any vote on the fate of Mr. Gerashchenko, who was silent on the ruble's collapse today, but lawmakers called for a vote of confidence in the Government for Oct. 21.   In time-honored Moscow fashion, Mr. Yeltsin also ascribed what is being called \\"Black Tuesday\\" to sabotage by unidentified enemies and speculators, and he ordered his National Security Council to work with the secret police to investigate. One Government official even called for an \\"unmasking trial,\\" the phrase used for the show trials that defined the purges of the Stalin era.   But rather than the work of some secret conspiracy, Tuesday's events seemed to result from a confluence of factors, and traders who saw an opportunity took it. Western diplomats, brokers and business executives said today that a correction in the value of the ruble had been inevitable, if badly controlled. They said the Russian inflation rate remained tolerable and that the panic would not have a lasting effect on investor confidence.   \\"I hope there won't be any re-evaluations on the part of investors,\\" said Maksim Boyko, director of the Russian Privatization Center. \\"But this whole episode underscores the fragility of the stabilization achieved in 1994. The Central Bank should share at least part of the blame.\\"   Reasons cited to help explain Tuesday's panic included currency speculation, inflationary expectations and a failure of the Government and central bank to act quickly enough to control the market.   After this summer's injection of credits into agriculture and industry, the Government and the central bank have made a coordinated effort to allow the ruble to adjust to higher inflation by slipping gradually from the 2,000 or so to the dollar of early this summer to about 3,000 or even 3,500 to the dollar, the rate at which the 1995 budget is figured.    Although Russians have enjoyed a relatively low inflation rate since August 1993, when inflation stood at 26 percent a month, the monthly rate has increased from about 4 percent in June to about 8 percent in September. (The monthly rate in the United States in August was three-tenths of a percent, about average for recent months.)    Since there is normally a three-month lag here between the release of new credits and an increase in the inflation rate, the estimated 7 trillion rubles of credits issued in July and August, and perhaps 3 trillion more issued in September, will continue to keep inflation running higher. In response to this expectation of continuing price increases, traders have been buying dollars, which has pushed the ruble down for three weeks now.   During the last three months, the Russian Central Bank has spent $2 billion of its reserves of Western currency to support and stabilize the ruble. Wary of spending too much, the bank announced last month that it would lessen its support of the ruble in the foreign exchange markets. On Monday and Tuesday, the bank bought few rubles, doing so only late on Tuesday to prevent the ruble from crashing past the 4,000 to the dollar.    With Mr. Chernomyrdin on vacation, the Government seemed paralyzed and said nothing. Only after trading ended on Tuesday -- followed by a reportedly stormy Government meeting -- did Mr. Gerashchenko of the central bank announce a sharp rise in short-term interest rates to make ruble holdings more attractive and declare that the bank would support the ruble at the start of trading today.   But with outstanding credits, unpaid salaries and a significant budget deficit to finance, economists and diplomats say, the Government had wanted a weaker ruble so that it would take fewer dollars to pay for it all. A weaker ruble also helps protect Russia's domestic industry by making imports more expensive, a demand that is frequently made by farm and industrial lobbies.   During a parliamentary debate today, Mr. Dubinin said that the panic was directly linked to recent subsidies to agriculture and defense industries. \\"Now we have to decide what we want -- either stabilization of finances with lower inflation or further subsidies to bankrupt enterprises,\\" he said. If the latter, \\"the ruble will continue to fall.\\"   Adding to the panic on Tuesday, bankers said, was a successful effort by a group of commercial banks, hurting from bad loans made when inflation was much higher, to manipulate the rules of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, or Micex, where the ruble is traded.   As one board member explained it, banks have been allowed to buy dollars and put up the rubles to cover their purchase two days later, a common international practice. But numerous banks, he said, bought dollars and then delayed payment up to four days, waiting until Tuesday night, when the ruble was at its lowest, to cover their purchases.   Now the exchange will return to the old method of requiring money to be deposited before any trade is approved, he said, to discourage currency speculation.    Jannik Lindbaek, executive vice president of the International Finance Corporation, a part of the World Bank, said today that the last few days would not change the fundamental attractiveness of Russia as a place for foreign investment.   \\"Interest in investing here is definitely a new trend, and it's not a blip on the radar screen,\\" Mr. Lindbaek said. \\"In this kind of environment, one should expect the currency market to be volatile. If we should go to hyperinflation, that would be different. But the stabilization policy of the Government is correct and necessary, and it is in fact taking hold.\\"   Average Russians, who saw prices for imported goods and even some domestic items zoom up during the course of a day, offered opinions ranging from imminent ruin to bemused shrugs.   Olga, a world-weary 24-year-old who works at the Voyazh kiosk in central Moscow, where a pack of Marlboros went from 1,900 rubles to 2,500 rubles and a Snickers bar from 1,000 rubles to 1,500 in hours, said: \\"Of course we've hiked our prices. But no one's complaining except the grannies.\\"    Leonid Abalkin, a well-known reform economist of the Gorbachev period, said people trusted the dollar more than their leaders. \\"In contrast to the Russian Government,\\" he said, \\"the U.S. dollar will not let you down or deceive you.\\"   Irina, who sells soaps and cosmetics at the Kabul department store nearby, said they had nearly doubled prices overnight, and there were fewer customers than usual. \\"We understand what has happened better than anyone,\\" she said. \\"We understand it with our pockets.\\" Yeltsin Moves Quickly to Calm Fears Over the Ruble"},{"year":"1934","title":"quotes Hearst on plebiscite HEARST IS QUOTED AS HAILING NAZI VOTE","excerpt":"Called the Result 'Unanimous Expression of Popular Will,' Hanfstaengl Declares."},{"year":"1938","title":"Lederer, Geo W GEORGE LEDERER, PRODUCER, IS DEAD","excerpt":"Called the Ziegfeld of His Day, Staged the Original 'Floradora'--Was 76 BEGAN AS CHILD SOPRANO Starred Lillian Russell and Marie Dressier--Devised Modern Revue Technique Lillian Russell's Producer Among His Other Hits Broadcast Reminiscences"},{"year":"1957","title":"Illus LANZA CASE AIDES DERIDED BY STONE, PAROLE HEAD SAYS","excerpt":"Called Them 'Eager Beavers,' Mailler Testifies--Court Backs Use of Tapes No Limit on Third Party Democrats Back Harriman DERISION OF AIDES IS LAID TO STONE Lanza Tapes Heard Expected Lanza to Be Held"},{"year":"1964","title":"CERTAIN so&#8208","excerpt":"called therapeutic ventures have gradually assumed a supralegal existence in our society.
