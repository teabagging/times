He shared the spot with Greg Whisman, who lost 1 point from the record 20 he scored in first round play. They trailed the leader, Dan Pohl, by 6 points. Pohl pushed his total to 24 Friday and finished his round before the storms disrupted play. The deficit, however, carries little meaning under the unique format used in this tournament. At this stage, players are simply attempting to stay alive through three rounds. (AP) Lopez Tied With Two Others: Nancy Lopez apparently needed some time off. After not playing the last two weeks, she shot a five-under-par 67 on Friday to share the lead with Judy Dickinson and Barb Much at the L.P.G.A. Northgate Computer Classic in Brooklyn Park, Minn. Dottie Mochrie, the leading money winner on the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour, made pars on the first seven holes over the par-72 Edinburgh U.S.A. course and then played at four under the rest of the way to finish one shot behind the leaders. Mary Murphy also was one shot back in the $425,000 event. Betsy King was among seven players who were two shots back at 69. The defending champion, Cindy Rarick, shot a 2-over 74, which was better than the 75 she had in last year's opening round. Beth Daniel, who won the inaugural Northgate two years ago, was at 73. Lopez, playing for the first time in the three-year-old Northgate event, got hot on the back nine with four birdies. She is winless on the tour this year but has finished in the top 10 in eight of her last nine outings, including four second-place finishes. (AP) Crampton Finishes Strong: Even with the lead at the G.T.E. Northwest Classic in Kenmore, Wash., albeit a small one, Bruce Crampton wasn't predicting anything positive. And that was despite a birdie-birdie-eagle finish Friday, which gave him a six-under 66 and a one-stroke lead over Arnold Palmer, Miller Barber and Larry Laoretti. \\"Golf is such a difficult way to make a living that you're never confident,\\" said Crampton, who has won 19 tournaments on the PGA Senior Tour, including the G.T.E. Northwest Classic in 1986 and 1988. \\"I've found it's better to let things happen.\\" Palmer was at 67, helped by his 16th career hole-in-one, along with Barber and Laoretti, the United States Senior Open champ. Tied at 68 were Don Bies, Ken Still, Rocky Thompson and John Joseph, who left his Millbrae, Calif., club job and qualified Monday for his first Senior Tour appearance. Defending champion Mike Hill was in a 10-way tie at 69 with Bert Yancey, Dick Hendrickson, Al Geiberger, Butch Baird, J. C. Snead, Bruce Devlin, Simon Hobday, J. C. Goosie and Dick Goetz. (AP) FOOTBALL Flutie Leads Calgary  Doug Flutie completed 24 of 35 attempts for 408 yards and two touchdowns as the Calgary Stampeders ended a two-game losing streak with a 44-23 victory over the British Columbia Lions in a Canadian Football League game Friday night in Alberta. Flutie, who joined the Stampeders this season as a free agent after playing two seasons for British Columbia, threw touchdowns passes of 28 yards to Carl Bland and 41 yards to Derrick Crawford. Flutie also rushed for 34 yards on six carriers and scored on a 1-yard run in the game played in snow flurries. Calgary improved to 5-2","excerpt":"British Columbia dropped to 0-7.

Boardman was more than six seconds better than the professional mark, established in 1986 by Gregor Braun of Germany.

Only diehard adherents to the American custard pie school should take exception to the cozy, chuckle-some insularities of this featherweight import, featuring David Tomlinson, Helen Cherry and Margaret Rutherford, as typically British as they come. Like a batch of predecessors, including several tidier ones, this present-day romp in a dilapidated Scottish castle shows a handful of ingenious sports briskly grappling with a moldy white elephant for the sake of the almighty quid and, of course, a bit of romance.The idea of having an impoverished aristocratic hero beset by creditors, a pair of smitten lovelies, grumbling boarders and the preposterous inconveniences of the old homestead is a joke that inevitably repeats itself. And here again it offers few surprises along the way. But the scenarists, Alan Melville and Edward Dryhurst (who also produced), director Henry Cass and the entire cast have undertaken their chores with such casual relish that while the film meanders it never flounders. The wry dialogue and general take-it-or-leave-it attitude of the visible participants make this offhand lark almost consistently amusing.Mr. Tomlinson, who heretofore has been guilty of a post-Eton starchiness, uncorks a sly resonance as the amiable, badgered hero. Miss Cherry, as his household director, and Barbara Kelly, as a predatory American millionairess with cattle-rustling forebears of Scots lineage, could hardly be smoother, or more decorative, in their tug-of-war over the Earl of Locharne. A. E. Matthews, Ewan Roberts and particularly Brian Oulton, as, respectively, a churlish boarder, the faithful butler and a bumbling Coal Board official, fill minor roles capably.All told, however, the over-all capability would be significantly lacking in spice without the presence of Margaret Rutherford. As a kilt-clad historian bent on proving the hero's right to the throne, this lady does a flamboyant, hilarious repeat of her \\"Passport to Pimlico\\" role, thundering through the picture like a dedicated rhino. Spectators who merely abide by the kind of urbane drollery that \\"Castle in the Air\\" typifies won't have to wait too long for Miss Rutherford's own personal earthquake.

Jerome. Paddles are used as slapsticks and boathooks for making pointed jabs at the—well, at the risibilities. That's the sort of picture it is.It is also a very pretty picture, and the quiet upper reaches of the Thames, the course for the Henley Regatta, the river traffic around the mossy locks and the green cricket fields at (probably) Windsor look very summery and serene in the quite surprising vestures of color and CinemaScope.The story, to be sure, is nonsense. The fellows, amusingly played by Laurence Harvey, Jimmy Edwards and David Tomlinson, latch on to three pretty, giggly girls who are likewise making a boat trip on a large launch, well chaperoned. But this doesn't stop our brazen fellows from shamelessly flirting with them, squiring them on a washed-out picnic and eventually invading their stately riverside home.This leads to smashing complications, for our fellows have girls and wives at home, and the aunt of one knows the mother of—oh, dash it! Such a row!But it's clean, simple fun of an order that you don't see much of these days. You might call it a British Keystone comedy set in the Edwardian age. And the three girls, played by Shirley Eaton, Jill Ireland and Lisa Gastoni, are as wholesome as peaches and cream and are fetching displayers of ankles and twirlers of tasseled parasols.A. E. Matthews, Ernest Thesiger and Miles Malleson add a cute scene as cricket umpires.If you're looking for a pleasant summer picture, this should be your dish of (iced) tea.

The models look more like the pretty girl next door than showgirls. The clothes look like things people actually wear, not just admire in magazines. The atmosphere is so friendly and relaxed that many people bring their children.   Arabella Pollen, the designer, cuddled her son, Jesse, 6 years old, as she accepted congratulations after her show. Betty Jackson's two young children were in the audience and Yasmin, her star model, shooed photographers away from Amber, her 2-year-old daughter, backstage afterward. No Baby Sitter Needed    \\"The British are so accepting of this sort of thing,\\" said Daniel Pilecki, whose 2-year-old daughter, Maddi, fell asleep on his shoulder during the Vivienne Westwood show. Mr. Pilecki was covering fashion for Japanese television. Like others in the audience, he was delighted not to hire a baby sitter. Most of the shows took place over the weekend.   The low-keyed presentations frequently brought the reaction from viewers that \\"these are all clothes I can wear.\\" Though there was some fashion movement, it was not the exuberant kind. Long slender skirts were introduced thoughtfully and tastefully. Still, most designers made sure they included some short styles so they would not antagonize women not interested in a change.   \\"I will be very thrilled when hemlines come down,\\" said Zandra Rhodes , who wore a festive shortblack dress at her opening. \\"My customers are not, I think, ready for it, but I myself will be thrilled not to look like mutton dressed up like lamb.\\"   For Betty Jackson, long is already in. \\"We've already shipped many long skirts to the stores for spring,\\" she said. \\"They're selling very well. The women who picked up short clothes early are ready for long ones.\\"   Miss Pollen, who showed a lot of slender but long clothes that always reached the boot tops (some are ankle length), was enthusiastic about the new length. \\"I love it,\\" she said.  \\"Long and slim looks great.\\"   Her sense of proportion, and the fact that she worked hard at achieving the right shapes, made Jean Muir's clothes successful at every level. One of the world's least pretentious great designers, she made her trademark crepe and jersey dresses look regal because of her sensitivity to the way they fit the body. Her colors, never riotous, focused on black, gray and olive green. An occasional more highly colored suede jacket or abstract-pattern sweater added spice to a sober and satisfying collection. Bobby Short, an old friend of the designer's who is making a film here with Michael Caine, led the applause from the first row.   Marc Bohan added a new deluxe group to his second ready-to-wear collection for Norman Hartnell, the couture house. Elegantly tailored suits are his strong point, plus a fluttering of black chiffon for evening.   The Hartnell clothes were among the 100 collections exhibited at the Duke of York's headquarters on King's Road under the auspices of the British Fashion Council. Designers are usually on hand to explain their clothes, part of the intimacy of the fashion business here. New Designers' Showcase    Relatively new designers like Bella Freud, whose father, Lucian, is a painter and whose great-grandfather was the psychoanalyst, have a chance to present their styles to potential buyers. \\"I'm so excited,\\" Miss Freud said the other day. \\"I just got my first Italian account.\\"    Miss Freud, 30, was also pleased that her favorite color, a cheerful blue, was widely accepted by retailers, perhaps to supplement the abundance of serious shades. Pale-blue cashmere sweaters were popular with chocolate brown leather skirts at the booth of another newcomer, Amanda Wakely, 29.   Several exhibitors, including Jenny Packham and Dale Tryon reported that the short skirt was not finished: their most popular styles were knee-baring evening dresses. Both have orders from Saks Fifth Avenue.   In his runway show, Roland Klein gave considerable attention to short, frothy dressy styles in contrast to his man-tailored daytime styles made more emphatic with vests and ties.   While frenetic pockets of design still exist, the main thrust of British fashion is not so crazy anymore. Even Vivienne Westwood, the archetypical eccentric designer, has been calming down. She has been investigating early-20th-century couture design, she said, which reminded her immediately of Hollywood.    So she called her current collection \\"Always on Camera\\" and filled it with movie-star touches like head scarves, fake white fox, jeans printed with the face of Marlene Dietrich and astonishing decolletages. Her models still stagger around on high-platform pumps, which gives an alarming tilt to some of her clothes, but honestly, the styles look considerably more tranquil than they have been.

There are marked sincerity in its theme and intelligence and truth in its execution. It is the story of the pathetic love of a Jewish girl and an Austrian officer, strangled by century-old prejudices and lighted by the harrowing fires of the pogrom and warring soldiery in a little Polish town on the Russo-Austrian front.Several fine performances, as well as the direction of E. A. Dupont, bring the story effectively to life, and if \\"Two Worlds\\" is not completely successful it is because the featured players in the parts of Russian and Austrian officers are too patently English. The Jew of the European Ghetto, long-suffering but patient under his burden, has never been pictured on the screen with more understanding and sympathy than in some of the scenes in this film.While the two armies are hammering at each other, the Jewish quarter of a town occupied by the Austrians is celebrating the Feast of the Passover. A pogrom breaks out and a squad of troops sent to fight the rioters accidentally kills the son of a patriarchal clockmaker. The young lieutenant in command goes away cursed by the old Jew and his daughter.Later, the Austrians evacuate the town, but the lieutenant is left behind. He falls wounded before the clockmaker's house and the daughter takes him in. During the days he lies hidden from the Russians the love between the two grows, while the wise clockmaker watches and frets. Knowing the union to be impossible, he is on the point of giving the young man up when the Austrians recapture the town. The two lovers renounce their love for each other in a final scene of leave taking.Randle Ayrton as the clockmaker and Donald Calthrop as his old friend, the shoemaker, deliver two altogether excellent characterizations. Norah Baring as the young Jewess was the only disappointment in an otherwise competent cast. \\"TWO WORLDS\\" AT COHAN.","excerpt":"British Film Tells War Romance of Russo-Austrian Front."},{"year":"1942","title":"HOLLYWOOD, Calif., Dec. 10 -- \\"The Mojave Kid,\\" a magazine short story by Borden Chase about an American desert fighting crew which is sent to Africa to combat Field Marshal Rommel's forces, has been purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and will be adapted to the screen for production early next year.

On the London music hall stages, for which it seems to have been originally designed, it would consume an eminently pleasant if not exactly ripping twenty minutes between the adagio dancers and the Japanese acrobats. On the screen it could be told with speed and humor in about two reels. Tortured and over-written into a full-length feature, \\"Are You a Mason?\\" is thin, brother, thin. Still it is a well-made bit of spoofing, and it is tossed about with polite abandon by two jolly old comics, Sonnie Hale and J. Robertson Hare.You see, there is a blighter who has been putting one over on his hatchet-faced wife for the last twenty years. She thinks he spends his Saturday nights at the Masons, where he claims to be the Worshipful Master. She nags her young son-in-law about joining the Masons, too, and finally he pretends he has, although he actually had forgotten to. Now you can just imagine the fun when the two supposed Masons are brought together. Rather a rag, what? The author calls in the venerable \\"Charlie's Aunt\\" motif later on to keep the story moving. Then the dialogue-polishers put in their tuppence worth. When one character explains that his marriage was a case of love at first sight, the other bowls the audience over with the quip that he should have taken another look. When the Worshipful Master is asked whether he can meet his creditors, he retorts: \\"That's the trouble. I keep meeting them all the time.\\" Just too killing.
