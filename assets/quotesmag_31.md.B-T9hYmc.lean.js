The works of 20th-century Latin American artists are featured, along with Hispanic-inspired works by non-Hispanic artists.   The show is based on a quincentennial \\"Spanish Steps\\" program introduced into the school's curriculum in 1991, focusing on the historic and cultural ties between the United States, Latin America and Spain.   Jean Charlot, now dead, whose work is on view, was born in France in 1898 but moved to Mexico in the 1920's and was a founder of the Mexican Mural Renaissance. He collaborated with Diego Rivera on mural projects in the 30's, and he painted portraits of many of his artist friends, including David Siqueiros and Jose Orozco.   Antonio Frasconi came to New York City from Uruguay in the 1940's on a scholarship to the Art Students League. His work as a printmaker and illustrator is known worldwide. He is now distinguished teaching professor of art at the State University of New York at Purchase.   Gabriela de la Vega, a native of Mexico, studied in Manhattan, Paris and Los Angeles and has an established reputation as a watercolorist and illustrator. Antonio Martorelli was born in Puerto Rico and studied in Madrid. He is a performance artist, writer and teacher as well as an illustrator and set designer.   Constance Del Vecchio Maltese is a native New Yorker and a member of the Society of Illustrators. She is best known for her portrait series of the great explorers, including Columbus, Magellan, Marco Polo and others, on view at the U.S.S. Intrepid Sea-Air Space Museum.   Alton Tobey, an American whose work is in the collections of major museums in the United States and Europe, contributed his portraits of several notable Mexican individuals painted during his 35 trips there.

FAMILY ART WORKSHOPS    Every Sunday from noon to 2:30 P.M., beginning today through May 23, two-hour family art workshops will be in progress at the Caramoor Center in Katonah.   The program, which takes advantage of the educational opportunities inherent in the architecture, furnishings, decorative and fine arts of Caramoor's House Museum, its outbuildings and landscaped grounds, was devised by Evelyn Albert, the new director of education and former museum educator at the South Street Seaport Museum in Manhattan.   Today's subject is stick puppets of the Renaissance, which the children and adults will make after touring the Music Room -- filled with Renaissance treasures -- and listening to music of the period.   Next Sunday's project is the making of a commedia dell'arte mask for Valentine's Day, based on an orientation tour of the museum. Workshops on such subjects as animals in architectural and decorative detail, door knockers, elaborate hats, and book-making are to be offered in future sessions.   The series is suitable for children from 4 through 11, accompanied by a parent or other adult. The fee for each workshop of $6 for adults and $4 for children includes materials. For reservations or more information, the number to call is 232-5035. Caramoor is on Girdle Ridge Road off Route 22.

From a production standpoint, at least, the Italians have accorded Rossini's comic masterpiece all that could be asked, in fine musicianship, handsome sets and a general adherence to the continuity and spirit of the original.Better still, a battery of five scenarists, through tactful pruning and the occasional inclusion of outdoor, naturalistic backgrounds, pluckily have tried to ease the Ferretti libretto out of a medium to which it remains perfectly suited. The same must be said for a reasonably camera-conscious director, Fernando Cerchio. Actually, this fanciful operatic re-telling of the traditional Perrault fairy tale shuffles the benighted heroine, her stepfather and stepsisters, the prince and his footman in enough bouncy intrigue to vibrate the camera.However, impersonally telescoped by such a demanding instrument, this screen opera can claim neither the frothy intimacy of its footlighted predecessor down the street nor the simple elasticity of, say, almost any unadorned Western—and we do mean horse opera.Lori Randi makes a beauteous, if buxom, heroine, with some splendid substitute vocalizing on the sound track by Fedora Barbieri.

The center of the story, a big, roving tomcat, does not emit even one meow, but his depredations lay the foundation for the lion's share of the amusement, especially in the incident where a couple of village functionaries believe they have devoured him disguised as a rabbit.Of course, the \\"Kater\\" comes through all right and lives to see the union of pretty Suse Graf with likely Albert Lieven. Also to witness the setting up of the production of skis by a group of Saxon wood carvers after Suse's grasping uncle (Ernst Legal) has tried vainly to profit by Lieven's improvement on the old type of wooden snow shoes. Naturally Suse helps the young artist in toy making win the battle against \\"big business.\\"Prominent in the excellent cast are the late Alfred Abel, Ida Wuest and Erhard Siedel.

While the technique of this piece, built on the tragedy of a popular singer (Señora Iris) separated from her infant daughter by an unjust 16-year prison sentence and having a Hollywood ending, generally is good, the photography is marred by occasional defects in focalization. Rolando Aguilar, who directed the film for José Luis Bueno, never allows the spectators' interest to lag and even throws in a nice ballet number, with Franz Lehar music. Young Magda Haller is attractive as the daughter determined to be an artist, although the voice that hits the \\"high spots\\" in her big song scene seems to belong to somebody else.

A drama of a Volga town shaken by civil war, it is well-acted, carefully written and staged and photographed in superior color. It emerges as the most appealing, least hysterical Soviet film about the Bolsheviks in some time. Combining both vigor and sensitivity, the Cameo's week-end arrival has real pull as an interesting yarn about persuasive people.The director-producer, Vladimir Basov, has assembled this picture with steady alertness. The graphic ease of its pacing unquestionably owes much to the source, a novel by Konstantin Fedin. Actually, this Artkino release is a sequel to a previous Fedin work, never shown here, called '\\"Early Joys.\\"It is 1917. The excellent fade-in—the wartime bedlam of a railroad station—fans out across the tense town, ticking off seven or eight main characters, who, in turn, are eventually brought into clear focus. They make a compelling gallery. It is to the credit of Alexei Kapler, the scenarist, that even with the hated \\"White Guards\\" guns pounding in the distance, his people are consistently human.In the film, the young hero is a fiery but fair-minded Bolshevik, patiently hearing the doubts of his embittered former commander. The local commissar is a battered, brave man who searches for a son he has never seen. The lovely heroine vacillates from hard reality to a sideline world of make-believe. A portly playwright is openly and caustically indifferent to the Cause. There are others, with their own problems, as the incidents adroitly intertwine most of the relationships.Does a rousing battle shed light and save the day? That it does—in one of those Russian specialties, full of shouting bayonet charges and splattering cannon balls. Had the picture ended right there, in wild-eyed triumph, it would have been a comedown, victory or no victory:Instead, it returns to the principals almost as thoughtfully as before. For instance, one joltingly powerful scene of a soldier's homecoming after five years quietly says more about war than anything else. And the romance between the hero and the heroine is leisurely and tenderly resolved, after which he rides off to the front again in a beautifully photographed fade-out.The acting is excellent, especially the performances of Viktor Korshunov and Roza Makagonova, as the sweethearts","excerpt":"Vladimir Vemelyanov, as the commissar, and, among others, Yuri Yakovlev and Mikhail Nazvanov.

Not only do I agree with you, but the Guatemalan voters agree, too. The Christian Democratic candidate (as corrupt and ill suited for the job as Mr. Cerezo) lost badly. The candidates who came in first and second, and face a January runoff, vowed:   (1) to clean up the army and get it under civilian control through the force of their leadership, and    (2) to remove statist privileges in the Guatemalan economy that have favored only the well-connected oligarchs because of its highly regulated structure.   Perhaps their economic programs were not as socialistic as you -- judging by your absurd recommendations for economic growth -- would like. But the Guatemalan people know far better than editorialists sitting in their clean offices in New York what is wrong with the Guatemalan economy.
