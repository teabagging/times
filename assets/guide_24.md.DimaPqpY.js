On Tuesday, they took a beating after one analyst lowered his earnings estimates for Citicorp, the bellwether of the group. And yesterday, investors ran scared upon hearing the surprise news that the First Chicago Corporation, another of the so-called money center banks, expected to report a loss of at least $70 million for the third quarter.\\n\\nBank analysts assumed that, since the news of First Chicago's write-off was so sudden, it was likely that bank regulatory authorities forced the issue. And that means, they said, that other large banks might have to write off more loans than they had planned as well. ''The regulators may well be operating with a sharper pencil,'' said William Welsh, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a New York brokerage and money management organization.

In recent sessions, natural gas, software and technology shares in general took their turns at being out of favor with investors, usually because of estimates of lower earnings.
