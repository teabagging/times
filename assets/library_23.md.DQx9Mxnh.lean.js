''In recent years,'' Mr. Carr pointed out, ''buyers have tended to emphasize quality rather than rarity. As a consequence, there has been enormous demand for coins in ''gem'' or ''choice'' mint condition. Mint- state examples of common-date coins, starting from a far lower base, have risen in value more sharply than mint-state key coins, even though the keys are, as a rule, much scarcer.\\n\\n\\n''In older series, especially, key coins are good buys in mint condition,'' he said. ''They haven't really had the same increase in value as the regular, commoner coins. The older the series, the more this has happened. In newer series, the keys have maintained their identity because these series are being collected by date and mint.

Metzroth, director of human resources at Salomon Brothers Inc. helps company executives find administrative assistants and secretaries. But in her off-hours, Miss Metzroth developed a subspecialty -hiring nannies and housekeepers - and eventually wrote a book about it. Now she uses her skills to help those same Salomon executives locate household help. Once a match is made, she lectures the new employers on their legal responsibilities, which she sums up succinctly as ''mountains of paper that take hours to complete.''   Not only is Miss Metzroth's description accurate, the accompanying payroll taxes and insurance also bump up the price of household help by almost 25 percent. But those who pay off the books risk an expensive run-in with state and Federal agencies.

Except for the 1869 German (now Lenox Hill) Hospital on the south side, East 77th Street between Park Avenue and Lexington Street was essentially raw land in the late 1870's.

Whatever the G.N.P. figures show, public discourse is already heavy with apocalyptic terms. Observe, for instance, the frequency of    draconian.      Connoisseurs of journalistic cliches know the term derives from the Athenian legal code that a fellow named Draco formulated about 621 B.C. It was pretty    draconian    all right, prescribing the death penalty for almost every offense. Times haven't yet gotten that tough, even in New York real estate, but everywhere, Draco's name is used in pain.     Writers seem almost daily to refer to \\"draconian Gramm-Rudman spending cuts,\\" the \\"draconian\\" speed with which new regulations have been pressed on financial institutions and \\"draconian\\" cuts in New York state spending.   The word from Europe, meanwhile, is even more alarming. Just before the world trade talks collapsed last week in Brussels, John C. Crosbie, Canada's Trade Minister, said grimly, \\"It's back to    ground zero   .\\" He was right to be alarmed but things are not that bad. What Mr. Crosbie probably meant was    square one   , back to the beginning. Ground zero means the surface area directly below or above the point of detonation of a nuclear bomb. Far from denoting a beginning, it suggests something much closer to the end.

Dr. King's moral authority rested upon the indisputable fact that African-Americans in the South were disfranchised by a white power structure that stopped at nothing to keep its power. The savagery was evident on the evening news, as when children were set upon with dogs and water cannons in the streets of Birmingham.   The passing of racism's most visible forms -- and the corresponding rise of a black elite -- would have required Dr. King to become more than just a champion of the African-American oppressed. His condemnation of the Vietnam War foreshadowed what might have become a broader strategy. So did his failed fair-housing campaign in Chicago in 1966. There were no dogs and water cannons in Chicago to inspire public outrage. Civil rights rhetoric by itself was no match for a patronage machine that could appear in blackface when it needed to. Dr. King's rallies were anemically attended. The machine, with black underbosses like the legendary Congressman William Dawson, sent Dr. King home defeated.

The change may be phrased another way: The early revolutionary pictures were films of promise, the recent ones are films of threat.The ground covered in the latest is very much the same as that covered by \\"We Are From Kronstadt.\\" The story is that of the Red Baltic fleet's defense of Petrograd and of Kronstadt, but there is this difference.

Although the battle scenes at sea and on land have definite pictorial effectiveness, there is an undramatic monotony about the successive Red victories — a monotony which exists, we hasten to add, aside from any question of fact.

Except in the sequence of the torpedo launches, the victories are achieved without suspense and almost too effortlessly to make them anything but a matter for patriotic self-congratulation.Nor is the personal drama any more effective or any less subtle in lesson. The argument, again, is let the intruder beware. Stalin will get him if he doesn't watch out. We've no objection to flag-waving (the picture ends, ecstatically, with a shot of the banner and a chorus of the \\"International\\") if that has not been the picture's only interest. Surely a nation which has won the ultimate victory can afford, for drama's sake, to lose a skirmish once in a while.

THE U.S. WORLD CUP BID HAD SOME SERIOUS FAILINGS"},{"year":"1967","title":"IT will be a good joke on us all if, in 50 years or so, Dylan is regarded as a significant figure in English poetry. Not Mr. Thomas, the late Welsh bard, but Bob, the guitar-picking American balladeer. One step toward the letter's canonization has been taken, in fact, in a full-length documentary, \\"Don't Look Back,\\" now at the 34th Street East Theater.It is an absorbing film. Whether one is a member of the under-30 set that regards Mr. Dylan as a spokesman, or one of the vanishing Americans over that age, this look into the life of a folk hero is likely to be both entertaining and occasionally disturbing.Those who know the songs will hear them here (\\"The Times They Are A-Changing,\\" \\"The Gates of Eden,\\" and so on) both in formal concerts and in hotel-room improvisation sessions. It is in the ad hoc gatherings that one glimpses something of what gives Mr. Dylan his extraordinary appeal for young people.We see him, this prickly, wary artist, almost dropping his guard as he jokes with the inner circle of his friends: Joan Baez","excerpt":"the English folk singer Donovan; Mr. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, and a few, a precious few, other intimates. The sequences that focus on Miss Baez provide the film some of its loveliest moments, letting one see her sad, somewhat weary but still Madonna-like beauty in flashes of repose and repartee. (One boy kids her affectionately. \\"She's got on one of those see-through blouses that you don't even wanna.\\")But it is Bob Dylan that we came to see, and it is ultimately frustrating to discern so little of the man beneath the bushy hair, the dark glasses and the leather jacket. Even in what appear to be candid shots, the performer's public face is turned to the camera. Mr. Dylan parries and thrusts with interviewers (some of them impossibly square, of course, and therefore perfect targets for the put-on); he doggedly and sullenly resists attempts to probe his psyche. If he has ideas, he hides them. He and his pals can have fun but it is a special, hip fun that always threatens to turn to anger.Technically the film, produced and directed by which was D. A. Pennebaker, uses the devices popularized by Richard Lester's Beatle movies. Hand-held cameras zoom and stagger about. Fast cuts and purposely crude editing keep the pace lively. The happy frenzy of the Beatle films is never suggested, perhaps because Bob Dylan is anything but a blithe subject. There are a few obtrusively arty shots, but in the main the story is allowed to tell itself in fairly direct ways. In fact, despite its up-to-date camera techniques, \\"Don't Look Back\\" is in the tradition of the chronological, sequential documentary familiar to several generations of moviegoers.Many scenes stick in one's mind, but it is often the people around the star who prove most fascinating. Mr. Grossman, the Buddha-like manager, helped to produce the film, and he moves through it like a hippier Hitchcock, impassively dickering with impresarios, oddly in tune with the Dylan ménage although he looks more like Andrés Segovia than a pop tycoon.Much of the film affects an air of being unplanned, and one has the sensation at times of being allowed to peep on the private lives of public idols. This is probably only a directorial trick, but it is a realistic one. There are drinking bouts, brawls and near-brawls, confrontations with hotel managers trying to enforce the nocturnal peace, and loud internecine rumbles over exactly who threw that water glass out the window. There is lots of uninhibited hard talk.And one does go away with a few solid hints as to what Mr. Dylan is up to, desperately though he resists anything like a friendly embrace. At the end, after a wildly successful concert at London's Royal Albert Hall, we see the poet-balladeer and friends chuckling over the \\"anarchist\\" tag hung on him by British newspapers. Mr. Dylan seems delighted to have put on the meretricious press, and fades out, happily sad in the eternal youth's realization that nobody understands him.

The new concerto brought the unsurprising news that Mr. Rorem had stayed true to the Romantic American style he inherited from Barber and Copland.

First came that series in which every one was a hero and the more of the enemy he sniped the greater was his valor. These were the films of hate. But with the war over there came a reaction to this primitive viewpoint and we shifted to pictures like \\"The Big Parade,\\" in which the enemy played a lesser rôle and the love interest gained in importance. This was followed by productions like \\"Journey's End,\\" in which an objective realistic treatment of soldiers in the trenches made war abhorrent. And finally \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" which added a pacifistic tendency to the cold neutrality of the observer. That should have closed the cycle—I must confess that I attend each new war picture with apprehension and some distaste.But now along comes \\"Niemandsland\\" (No Man's Land) at the Mozartsaal and knocks my theories lobsided. Here is a film that has a lot of things to say about war and says them in an entirely new language. The authors, Leonhard Frank and Victor Trivas, have gone at war with such a passionate bitterness, with such sardonic vituperousness, that a picture of very extraordinary virility and power came out. There are scenes in this picture which are as moving and stirring as anything I have ever experienced in a theatre. In Germany where the reactionaries are looming so threateningly in the background the Resco Film Company, who produced this picture, has done something very closely verging on the heroic. The judges who award the Nobel prize for peace could do worse than consider the parents of this film for their next award.Odd Companions.The basic notion about which the film is built is a simple one. Five soldiers, a German, a Frenchman, an Englishman, a Russian Jew and a Negro are caught in a shell hole in no-man's-land. Their common peril brings them together. The observers of the opposing armies report that there are human beings in no-man's-land and they are shelled front both sides. They crawl out of their retreat and side by side they march forward beating down the barbed wire barriers. That is a simple idea which might have occurred to hundreds of writers, it is the way it is carried out that gives the film its exceptional quality.The picture opens with brief picturizations of the lives of its protagonists before the war. The Russian Jew is a tailor and is celebrating his marriage","excerpt":"the Englishman, a clerk, has just had a son born; the German is a contented carpenter, whose Sunday occupation is conducting a \\"Gesangverein\\"; the Frenchman is a factory worker who has just fallen in love; the Negro is a successful tap dancer in vaudeville. Then comes the war, symbolized by the reading of the various proclamations. All the five are wrenched out of their quiet, happy existences. Particularly original in conception was the German's mobilization. Dejected and unhappy he leaves his store. But as he walks along be gets into a crowd headed for the barracks. A military band is heard and he gets into the rhythm. His depression falls off and he marches along with chest stuck out, stroking his mustache and with an inane smile on his lips. After a few impersonal war scenes, which are a skillful blend of actual scenes and studio shots, we go directly to the sequence in the shell hole which opens into a deserted dugout. The German finds the Russian caught under a huge beam. It is too heavy for him to lift alone, and the Frenchman, who has been hidden in a dark recess, comes out and helps. Thus the first contact is established. Then the Negro in his Zouave uniform drags in the stunned Englishman. The other help to bring him around.A New Problem Opens.Now comes the problem of making themselves understood to the others. The Jew is shell shocked and has lost the power of speech and the Negro, who has a smattering of all languages, is the interpreter for the other three. Everything goes along smoothly; photographs of wives, sweethearts and children are exchanged. But then the subject of who started the war gets into the conversation and the German, Englishman and Frenchman begin shouting fruriously at each other. The Negro breaks into this with a gale of laughter and getting up on a packing case beings to do a tap dance, introducing himself in three langages as the international vaudeville artist—at home all over the world. The spell of hate is broken. Now the outposts espy the smoke of the fire which the castaways have built and bobardment from btoh fronts begins. The Negro, naked to his waist, shouting and cursing at the cannons, begins a wild primitive dance of defiance and hatered of the death-dealing machines—an unforgetable moment. The firing stops, but they decide they must leave. They clamber up out of the shell hole. The five stand side by side in no man's-land. And then a march rhythm begins, faint, distant, but swelling to a triumphal hymn as the soldiers draw near the camera. Before them is a tagled barricade of barbed wire. As one man they beat it down with their guns and march on. This daring transition from naturalism to a symbolic picturization of the united nations beating down the idea of war was completely successful. The audience grasped it immediately and burst into a tumult of cheers and applause.And all this was achieved by the director, Trivas, with actors none of whom bad ever even been featured; indeed, several of them here make their film deébut. And yet Ernst Busch as the German and George Péclet as the Frenchman gave performances of convincing humanity and sincerity. Wladimir Sokoloff had a touching helplessness as the dumb Jew and Louis Douglas as the Negro tap dancer a naïve charm and a jungle wildness. As this is Trivas's first film there are, of course, some technical imperfections. There are draggy sequences and others which would have been considerably more effective if they had been differently cut. But for me they did not disturb the evening at all. I came away with the feeling of having seen something young and sturdy and straight.Another film of youth is \\"Der weisse Rausch\\" (The White Ecstasy), which is being shown at the Ufa Palast. This is the latest work of Arnold Fanck, the director of \\"The White Hell of Piz Palü\\" and \\"Mont-Blanc.\\" As you have probably read in the news columns, Fanck has been engaged by Universal to make a mountain-climbing film in America. If he gets the right sort of help for his acting scenes he should be able to turn out a film which will interest everybody. He is a master of this milieu. Nobody knows better how to catch the grandeur of mountains up into the camera.The present picture is a reversion to \\"Das Wunder des Schneeschuhs,\\" which he made ten years ago. This was a scenic without story, which pictured the delights of skiing. It was an immediate and overwhelming success. And many spectators have regretted that he added plots to his later films. To me, however, his culminating point was \\"Piz Palü,\\" probably because here the actors were directed by the excellent G. W. Pabst.\\"Der weisse Rausch\\" as merely a modern version of \\"Das Wunder des Schneeschuhs\\" with dialogue and sound effects. There are many excellent things in it; the skiing is often entrancing and exciting and sometimes quite hilarious. But there is too little variety to keep you interested for an hour and a half. Particularly in the paper chase on skis, which takes up the last half hour of the running time, there is an enormous amount of repetition. The sixtieth time that the skiers go whizzing by the camera your thoughts begin to wander. But Hannes Schneider and the rest of the male skiers are masters of their art, and Leni Riefenstahl is undoubtedly the best skier of the film stars (why will she try to be kittenish?). Cut up into two or three shorts it would make a novel addition to any program.NO One Man,\\" which graces the Paramount screen this week, is from a novel by Rupert Hughes. With Palm Beach for its main field of action, the film follows a glistening beauty whose boast it is that she needs more than a constant husband to make her happy. The cast is headed by Paul Lukas, Carole Lombard, Ricardo Cortez, Juliette Compton and Ricardo Cortez.The Roxy has a new item in the Fox series of Charlie Chan mysteries. This one is \\"Charlie Chan's Chance,\\" and it gives the whimsical Charlie of Earl Derr Biggers' novels an opportunity to mouth oriental epigrams and solve a homicide at the expense of Scotland Yard. Warner Oland has his old role as the Chinese detective, and his support includes H. B. Warner, Linda Watkins, Alexander Kirkland and Marion Nixon.\\"The Champ\\" is at the Capitol, following its engagement at the Astor. This is a sentimental tale of a broken-down prizefighter and his little boy, and Wallace Beery shares the spotlight with Jackle Cooper.At the Mayfair is Helen Twelvetrees in \\"Panama Flo,\\" a melodrama of the South American jungles. Charles Bickford and Robert Armstrong take turns persecuting Miss Twelvetrees, who appears as the unfortunate but inherently good girl of a Panama honky-tonk.

However, ensemble is one of those double-edge words - ''dynamic'' is another - that vaguely suggest something or other to the man in the street and something else, something more precise, to a musician. The lingo of any trade, profession or calling has many such twin-bladed words. When a musician speaks of good ensemble he refers to the kind of relationship among performers that the better string quartets develop, an understanding so close that the group seems to breathe in and out together, one in which individual egos lose themselves in the effort to make something irreducibly, mysteriously whole out of a collection of spare parts.

Initiative and referendum would guarantee the people the right to change the status quo in the best interests of the public.   My proposal for initiative and ref erendum is indirect","excerpt":"the entire deliberative process of the Legislature, committee meetings, hearings, public debate, amendments, would be fully utilized. Ballot proposals would be fully discussed and analyzed. The Legislature would have the first opportunity to address the issue, and it would go onto the ballot only if the Legislature refused to adopt it.   Narrow interest groups have been the most vocal in their opposition to this initiative and referendum concept. In 1986-87, they all banded together to defeat it.   Signature thresholds are high: 372,000 valid signatures for a constitutional amendment and 248,000 for a statutory change. No more than 15 percent of the total signatures could come from any one county, and the residents of at least seven counties would have to sign an initiative and referendum petition to guarantee that no special-interest or regional groups would benefit.   The people of New Jersey have repeatedly expressed their desire to be granted the powers of initiative and referendum, through public referendums in 1979 and 1980. In 1981 and 1983 the Senate gave its collective approval of initiative and referendum by staggering margins, only to see the bill die in the lower house. Half the people polled by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University in New Brunswick said it would be a good idea to allow the people of New Jersey the powers of initiative and referendum and recall.   In New Jersey, 151 municipalities and 6 counties allow their people these rights. Twenty-three states allow initiative for statutes or constitutional amendments; 25 states allow for citizen-sponsored referendums. Voter turnout in these states is traditionally higher than in other states.   I think it is time that New Jersey extends these same rights, implied in the Constitution, to its residents.

For the rulers of Russia's rural fiefdoms, Ms. Roosevelt writes, life was \\"a study in contrasts, paradoxes and extremes.\\" Small wonder, then, that in the 1750's, when Prince Nikita Trubetskoy commissioned his Baroque mansion in the hills above the Moscow River, he chose to call it Neskuchnoe -- \\"not boring.\\"   Alida Becker Books in Brief: FICTION & POETRY;Living Large"},{"year":"1929","title":"Entire group plans to attend Natl Recreation Cong at Louisville, Ky PLANS TRIP TO LOUISVILLE.","excerpt":"The Entire Westchester Recreation Group Going to Congress Oct. 14."},{"year":"1998","title":"Idlewild, the 1960's customized jet lounge at 145 East Houston Street between Eldridge and Forsyth Streets, is about to board.

By confining himself to only a few points in space, he made the empty stage around him seem a vast void. Although he kept turning from side to side, as if expecting someone to enter, no one was ever there. Nor was there anyone to touch when he spread his arms wide. From time to time as he danced to recorded music by Astor Piazzola, he clenched his fists, then bent over and drummed them quietly on the floor.

The composer is Jean-Philippe Rameau, the master of the French Baroque. But neither the Metropolitan nor the New York City Opera has staged one of his works (the Met is just getting its feet wet with     Handel this winter). Nor have we been deluged with concerts of Rameau's instrumental music, or with extensive scholarly publications and celebratory articles. Nor, really, have the record companies outdone themselves with new Rameau recordings. But there are a few, and nearly all of them are lovely.   Why this relative neglect? The main reason would seem to be the stylistic distance between us and the French Baroque. Modernism placed a premium on structural rigor and antidecorative austerity. That return to Classicism meant, during the 1920's, a renewed interest in the German Baroque, since we could dwell upon the contrapuntal integrity of, say, Bach's music without worrying overmuch about his own freely conceded debts to the French. The Italians, too, made simple and clear-cut music, especially in the stripped- down performance style popular during the 1950's.

In fact, a theory or experimental result can hardly be said to exist until it appears in a refereed journal, for which papers are reviewed by a group of the author's peers.   Last week this notion of publish or perish took a grim new turn when it was learned that scientists had withheld news of a promising AIDS therapy partly because they were afraid that an early announcement would ruin their chances of publication.   On May 15, a panel convened by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases concluded that steroid hormones could halve the death rate from pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, the leading killer of people whose immune systems have been undermined by AIDS. But the announcement was delayed five months while panel members tried to agree on how to word a statement so that they wouldn't run afoul of publications, like The New England Journal of Medicine, that refuse to publish studies that have been described in the press.   Doctors were not alerted to the findings until Oct. 10, when the institute -- with permission from The New England Journal -- sent out a mailing. But there was still no public announcement. Two of the studies that the panel's findings are based on will finally appear in the Nov. 22 issue of the journal.   Editors who adhere to the publication policy say they are simply trying to insure that scientific information is impartially reviewed before it is publicized. And the New England Journal has said that exceptions could be made in life-threatening situations.

NEW AFRICA-AID EFFORTS"},{"year":"1995","title":"Sullivan's Skyscraper Q.  I recently heard that the great American architect Louis Sullivan designed only one building in New York. True?  A.  Yep. And Sullivan, who was considered the founder of the Chicago School of architecture and responsible for many of that city's finer buildings, left his only mark on the city in a rather unusual spot: tucked away on the less traveled segment of eastern Bleecker Street.    Sullivan, who helped create skyscraper design (a hallmark of early Chicago architecture), designed the the Bayard-Condict Building, which was built at 65 Bleecker Street at Crosby Street in 1898.    Standing 12 stories tall (yes, that was a skyscraper at the time), the building was considered a radical departure from the more ornate New York style, according to the AIA Guide to New York City.   It sports a white terra-cotta fronting and is crowned by a sextet of angels supporting the cornice. (According to legend, the first owner, Silas Alden Condict, insisted that Sullivan include the angels in his design, despite the architect's protests.) Sullivan never built another building in New York City","excerpt":"the exact reasons are unclear. According to \\"Architecture, Ambition and Americans,\\" by Wayne Andrews (Harper & Bros., 1947), rivalry and territorialism were rife between New York and Chicago architects and may have discouraged Sullivan, whom Frank Lloyd Wright referred to as his \\"lieber Meister.\\" And he may have chafed at complications in constructing the Bayard-Condict that were caused by New York's conservative building codes, says the Blue Guide New York by Carol von Pressentin Wright.    Or, suggests Carl Condit, an architectural historian, the building may simply have been overlooked. \\"Who would expect,\\" Mr. Condit says in the AIA Guide, \\"an esthetic experience on Bleecker Street?\\"  Monument to Obstinacy Q.  In front of the Village Cigars shop at the corner of Seventh Avenue and Christopher Street, there's a bewildering triangular mosaic in the sidewalk that reads \\"Property of the Hess Estate which has never been dedicated for public purpose.\\" What is the story behind this tessellated tease?  A.  The mosaic is the result of a bitter dispute between the former owner of the property, the estate of David Hess, of Philadelphia, and the City of New York.    This is the story, according to \\"Greenwich Village and How It Got That Way,\\" by Terry Miller (Crown, 1990). The Voorhis, a five-story apartment building at that corner owned by the Hess estate, was condemned when the city built the IRT subway lines during the late 1910's.    The city wanted the Hess estate to donate the rest of that property, a triangle measuring about 500 square inches, for part of the sidewalk.    The Hess estate obstinately refused and took legal action to keep their tiny plot, leaving the smallest piece of private property in the city. And they covered it with the headstrong message that you saw. The Hess estate got out of the miniature business in 1938 when they sold the plot to the owners of Village Cigars for $1,000.    Or about $2 a square inch. Divided, a Park Stands   Q.  There's a park in two pieces on Second Avenue between 16th and 17th Streets. Has it always been divided? A.  Numerologists will love this one. Stuyvesant Square is two equal two-acre chunks that have always been split by Second Avenue, according to the trusty Blue Guide. It used to be a part of Peter Stuyvesant's farm before the family made the land a gift to the city (for a nominal $5) in 1836. It was landscaped, with Second Avenue flowing through, in 1936, an even 100 years later.

Crude but never improved upon, the rule requires the courts to throw out illegally seized evidence as a deterrent to misconduct by law officers enforcing the law. Fight Crime, Not Liberty","excerpt":"The Exclusionary Rule Needs Protection"},{"year":"1936","title":"Excursion steamer Onteora destroyed, Bear Mt POPULAR RIVER BOAT IS DESTROYED BY FIRE","excerpt":"The Excursion Ship Onteora Burns to Water's Edge Near Bear Mountain Dock."},{"year":"1993","title":"Two big stories in the classical-music business during the summer made more sense after an item appeared in this newspaper about artists handing out $10 bills to illegal immigrants in Southern California. One of the artists, David Avalos, said that giving away money signed by him and his colleagues was both art and political statement: in his terms, \\"the interaction of physical space with intellectual space and civic space.\\"   What you do becomes less important than what you think about what you do. The idea comes first","excerpt":"the execution is less interesting. Pity the poor performance-art critic asked to review Mr. Avalos in action. Does one admire the motion of the wrist as $10 pass from one hand to the next, the ethereal crackle of new bills in passage, the virtuoso fleetness of recipients as they repair to the nearest cantina?

Unfortunately, as much credit cannot be given the accomplishment. The idea is good","excerpt":"the execution is somewhat shaky and thin.The picture begins with three film men—a writer, a director and a popular star, the latter played by the perky but obviously middleaged Willy Fritsch—sitting down in the country and trying to dream a story for a new film. They agree only on one thing: they don't want a war film. No bombs. A middleaged fellow passes with his young and healthy country wife. The director starts to tell the story of these two. Slow dissolve. Flash back begins.It is the story of a modest little romance between the man, a Berlin aristocrat, and the girl who became a housemaid in his battered home during the war. Under the tension of bombings the barriers of social distinctions were broken down, and love (as it has a way of doing) feebly but definitely bloomed. At the end of the war, the gentleman followed the maid back to her home on a farm, but a marriage was at first forbidden. At this point, the director's story ends.The playwright suggests that the conclusion should be in a tragic vein. Mr. Fritsch wants a hearts-and-flowers ending—and sees himself in the role of the man. But upon very simple inquiry, the three discover that the romance was resolved in an easy and natural fashion. And that is the end of the film.To be sure, there's a pleasant simplicity about the general performance of this film, and the girl is rather attractive in the person of Hildegarde Neff. But Hans Sohnker is sluggish as her suitor and the romance moves at such a solemn pace that it utterly clashes with the briefer and lighter framing interludes. Mr. Fritsch, an old pre-war German favorite, is not the glamour-boy he used to be.This film was made in the British zone of Germany and it has English subtitles to match the dialogue.

When, weak and emaciated, Kimberly Bergalis testified before Congress in 1991, she set off nationwide alarm.

With a listlessness at odds with his usual sidewalk-preacher oratorical style, Mr. Clinton couldn't drum up one compelling reason that a tiny nation whose economy is in shambles and whose military is a shadow of our own posed a risk to national security.

He pursued this ambitious project until shortly before his death in 1964, recording a host of renowned figures, including Marian Anderson, James Baldwin, Romare Bearden, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Zora Neale Hurston and Richard Wright. The marvelous exhibition \\"Oh, Write My Name,\\" at the Manhattan East Gallery on the Upper East Side, presents 50 of Van Vechten's portraits in rich photogravure prints by the acclaimed printmaker Richard Benson.   Van Vechten made good use of a few stylistic elements to achieve a surprisingly wide range of expression in his pictures. The portraits, photographed with a 35-millimeter camera, are all verticals and present the subjects framed from the waist up. For most of the pictures, Van Vechten adopted the simple device of posing his subjects in front of distinctively patterned fabrics. In one, a professorial W. C. Handy is shown in front of a star-spangled background, while the painter Jacob Lawrence appears in a picture from 1941 seated in front of a cloth printed in interlocking geometric forms. No doubt this was practical, allowing him to take pictures in virtually any setting. But it also gives the photographs both consistency and diversity, while not distracting from the main business of recording the appearance of the sitter.

After a rousing, celebrity-powered rally in the once-conservative stronghold of Orange County, Calif., on Thursday night, Mr. Clinton lost his temper with a Secret Service agent when a couple of autograph seekers evaded a rope line in the parking lot of the amphitheater and got to Mr. Clinton.

It is remarkable, for example, how little affection can be felt for most of the composer's works. There is marvel, no doubt, at their precision, their pungent sounds, their irony; there is excitement at their imagination, their sense of musical frisson. But these works are admired more than they are loved. Who has deep affection for ''Petrouchka'' or sympathy for the ''Symphony of Psalms''? Who listens to ''Canticum Sacrum'' with devotion or to the ''Rite of Spring'' with empathy? This is music that is full of poses, music that expresses attitudes and takes on roles.

Although she's a descendant of the great 19th-century novelist, Joanna Trollope has a closer literary forebear in Barbara Pym, with whom she shares a fondness for depicting the vagaries of English life as expressed within the self-absorbed, often slightly nutty world of an institution like a church or a school. \\"The Choir\\" has both: the King's School, regarded by local Socialists as a bastion of class privilege, and Aldminster cathedral, whose troupe of young male choristers is composed of students from King's. The discovery that the cathedral requires expensive repairs prompts its smoothly authoritarian dean to propose discontinuing the choir. He claims the money saved will pay for the necessary work, but the author makes clear there's another motive: to eliminate an aspect of cathedral life not entirely under his control. As she follows the battle to save the choir, Ms. Trollope deftly follows a quirky cast of characters, including the dean's overbearing wife and their troubled daughter, who fancies herself in love with the cathedral's brilliant, difficult organist. Also on the scene is the unhappily married mother of the choir's best singer","excerpt":"the fact that she's the object of the organist's affections may well cost him his job. An assortment of other staunchly British supporting characters are lifted above stereotype by the sharp individuality with which they are drawn. The fate of the choir is never seriously in doubt (at least, not to the reader), but some truly nasty behavior by characters who are not simply villains -- and the realistically unpleasant consequences of that behavior -- save the novel from being just another exercise in There'll Always Be an England quaintness.

No attempt has been made to render this a movie, for it is as faithful a transcription of the narrative as one could well imagine. The producer has not sparred for a happy ending, and in portraying the conduct of the scandalmongers he has found a way to include a little comedy here and there without exaggerating the characters.\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" was directed by Victor Seastrom, an earnest Swedish director who gained no little fame through his production \\"The Stroke of Midnight,\\" a picture which has never been exhibited publicly in this country. Mr. Seastrom also made the film version of \\"He Who Gets Slapped.\\" The adaptation of Hawthorne's classic was entrusted to Frances Marion, whose clever script for \\"The Dramatic Life of Abraham Lincoln\\" assisted materially in the production of that masterful study of the martyred President.Louis B. Mayer, head of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, could not have chosen a better director than Seastrom for Nathaniel Hawthorne's narrative. He is painstaking in studying his characters, and it was to his advantage to have Lillian Gish in the principal rôle, that of Hester Prynne. Miss Gish has a strong inclination for such parts, and in this vehicle she gives an excellent, conception of the courage of a young woman in the face of sneering, scorn and tittle-tattle. It causes one to contrast those days with the present time","excerpt":"the fashions of the past with the feminine creations of our generation. She is charming. She falls from grace, and after the perfunctory trial she is condemned to bear the letter \\"A,\\" to tell the world that she has sinned.After the preliminary scenes near Boston, the director loses no time in depicting the shameless bigotry of the people, by first showing Hester Prynne's canary escaping from its cage and then having the young woman locked in the stocks for unseemly merriment and prancing through the lanes on the Sabbath. Actually she had only run after her bird, and this caused her to be late for the church service. A splendid idea of the little it took to start wagging tongues is obtained through the glimpes one has of the congregation, who look at Hester with the eyes of Pharisees eager to be present at her punishment.In those good old days it was the law that no engaged couples should be permitted to kiss until they were married. Hence they are pictured talking through a long tube. No feminine underwear was permitted to be hung on a clothesline, where it might meet the eyes of the men, and through this edict Mr. Seastrom displays a touch of comedy.It was with not a little pleasure that one perceived Mistress Hibbins rudely delivered into the hands of the mighty by the cunning of the loquacious Giles. He enters the gossiper's home, puts on her bonnet while she is asleep, and, while standing near an open window, delivers a nasty opinion of the Governor and the Beadle, just as those serious-minded gentlemen are passing. Mistress Hibbins's protestations of innocence fall on deaf ears, and she is sentenced to be ducked by means of a primitive implement which causes the punishment to be quite an excellent entertainment to others, especially to those who had suffered by the good lady's constant babble. And the hefty Giles decides that he is unusually fortunate because he has to officiate at the ceremony of ducking the scandalmonger.The Rev. Dimmesdale strikes one as being a peculiarly spineless person, wavering between a confession of his sin and clinging to his position as minister. He is the father of Hester's child, and he punishes himself one night by branding the letter \\"A\\" on his own chest. This rô1e is acted by Lars Hanson, who, while he is indubitably sincere in his performance, occasionally appears to be too optimistic in his expression.Henry B. Walthall figures as Roger Prynne, who is supposed to have been a prisoner of the Indians for seven years, which accounts for a beard and expression mindful of Svengali. There is a stirring scene when he appears, for he is a physician who had deserted Hester soon after they were wed. He knows that her sick child is not his, but he finally concocts medicine that saves the little girl, hoping for a later vengeance on the father of the child and Hester. Here one thinks that he has little to say in the matter, considering his treatment of Hester.Karl Dane, who won his screen spurs by his performance as Slim in \\"The Big Parade,\\" officiates in this new picture as Giles. He does exceedingly well with the rôle.There are some cleverly pictured scenes in the church and the sights of crowds betray imaginative direction, both in the handling of the players and in their arrangement according to the shades of their costumes.

Zanuck, the Dionne quintuplets, are running through their limited but endlessly fascinating dramatic répertoire at the Roxy this week, with admirable unaffectedness for such completely bewitching little darlings. They bring with them, perhaps, too numerous a supporting cast of grown-ups, for the truth is that \\"Reunion\\" is pretty regrettable, as much for the superfluous adult presences on the screen as for the too frequent and too long absences of the Callander glamour girls.Of course, it is almost impossible not to have story trouble with leading ladies who are 2 years of age and five in number, but serializing the quins in annual chapters was Mr. Zanuck's idea, and he has only himself to blame if he is stuck with it. Dr. Hersholt continues to be the obstetrical-minded hero, and what little plot there is in the film revolves about his benign person and the occasion of a reunion of all the 3,000 persons he has brought into the world, with some slight aid, perhaps (though this fact is all but suppressed), from their respective mothers. To \\"Moosetown\\" they come from every corner of the land to pay their respects and incidentally to have their intimate emotional problems solved by the doctor, who is made out to be a combination of Paul Pry, Santa Claus and Mr. Fix-it, which might possibly in certain circumstances—for instance, if a couple didn't want to have their problem solved and be married off—prove embarrassing as the very deuce.As for Yvonne, Cecile, Marie, Annette and Emilie, they are shown doing irresistible 2-year-old things: drinking out of their porridge bowls or diverting them with scientific detachment to study their undersides, smearing their faces adorably, pounding on the piano, doing acrobatics over the sides of their quinary of cribs, being naughty and sucking their State-subsidized thumbs, flirting with the doctor around the corners of furniture, &c.

This might be all very well on a journey of fifteen miles, but Bill James is bound from Pennsylvania to California!Pat Stack, an idler, who tries occasionally to look tearful over his blunders, at the opening of this story has invested the family fortune in California. The only wage-earner among the Stacks is Mary Ellen, and she, being a decided little person, one day declares that the Stack belongings are to be sold and that the four of them are going to California. She invests in a ramshackle automobile and off they go.Just about that time the directors of a big automobile concern offer $10,000 for the first car they manufactured.

The dollar has recently fallen to its lowest level against the euro in more than a year and a half, and, if the descent accelerated, the Federal Reserve eventually might be prompted to respond with a rate rise, currency-market watchers say.

While it is true that, in a first offering of a condominium, everyone will be signing the contract that appears in the prospectus, there is no guarantee that it is the contract you should sign. After the condominium is sold out, the sponsor or other owners may resell units under a different contract and terms.   Even though you have already signed the contract, a lawyer or someone familiar with condominium closings still can review it to make sure your rights have not been abridged and that everything you have been promised is in writing.

They want to flip-flop down a lonely path, unfold their chairs or spread their towels on an empty patch of sand, and bask in the security of isolation. Certainly a public beach is a more perilous prospect. One risks being boinged by a stray paddle ball or sprinkled with sand as some carefree teen-ager races past. One risks empty Coke cans in the sand, and having one's physical imperfections exposed to strangers. One risks humanity, perhaps throngs of it, all united in the same democratic pursuit of sun, open air, the smell of salt water, the song of crashing surf.   Yet public beaches offer pleasures that no private beach can rival. There is junk food, sumptuous arrays of it, from french fries to pretzels to lemony Italian ices to Good Humor ice cream","excerpt":"the feel of a Popsicle stick against the tongue captures the essence of summer. There are boardwalks, those casual roadways of beach traffic that never stray off a parallel line with the water's edge. There are brawny dudes and voluptuous babes, all wearing bathing suits more outrageous and colorful than you'd ever dare. Public beaches offer an unusual and intriguing sense of community: impervious to class, race or income, they encourage you to drown your identity in an ocean of bodies, coconut oil, laughter and warmth.   From Astroland amusement park at Coney Island to the terrace at Orchard Beach, New York City's public beaches present a rare opportunity for adventure. Early architecture and old-fashioned signs allow a glimpse into the past, while the weathered snack shacks and sturdy, well-kept boardwalks bring it smoothly into the present. These beaches are more than just sand and surf; they're culture, experience, a history of a city at play. Brighton Beach      2.5 miles, on the Atlantic Ocean, from Brighton 15th Street to West 37th Street, Brooklyn, (718) 946-1350.     ATMOSPHERE: Brighton Beach is from another place, another time. It has a ghostly, romantic quality that comes as much from the old apartment buildings and slightly run-down seaside concession stands as from the aging Soviet emigres who wander the boardwalk, murmuring in their native tongue. The ocean view stretches all the way to the horizon, suggesting distant lands.   PEOPLE: Predominantly Soviet immigrants, many of them over age 50. Men with white chest hair and straw fedoras; women wearing kerchiefs on their heads and embroidered sweaters. To shade themselves from the sun, the men wear white noseguards; the women simply hold their purses or newspapers above their heads.   SAND: Hazardous -- broken glass, jagged pieces of shells, bottle tops. But then, the beach itself isn't really the point here.   SURF: Swimming isn't the point, either.   BOARDWALK: The center of activity. People gossip and philosophize, walking with unhurried steps or perched on benches like pigeons on a wire. Riegelmann Boardwalk continues all the way to Coney Island (a 10-to-15-minute walk), and the barren frame of the Parachute Jump is clearly visible in the distance. A plank mural between the two beaches asks rhetorical questions like \\"Will listening to the ocean add years to your life?\\" and \\"Did it rain yesterday?\\"   MUSIC: Ethnic folk songs with people dancing and clapping along; gentlemen serenading their lady friends with 1940's pop ballads played on tinny portable radios.   FOOD: Signs with old-fashioned lettering announce \\"Hirsch's Knishes,\\" \\"Filipp's Cafe,\\" \\"Gastronom Moscow.\\" Faded Pepsi logos, plastic chairs and tables with umbrellas. The Boardwalk Cafe doubles as a grocery store, with petrified-looking seafood in glass cases and canned goods with labels in Russian.   ARCADE: None; too modern a concept.   DIVERSIONS: Playground and tennis courts nearby. One mysterious building is labeled \\"B A DW LK MENS LUB,\\" with a crooked \\"For Members Only\\" sign hanging in the dark entrance.   NEIGHBORHOOD: Bustling street with discount stores and coffee shops in the shadow of elevated subway tracks.   CLAIM TO FAME: Neil Simon's \\"Brighton Beach Memoirs.\\" Orchard Beach      1.1 miles, on Long Island Sound in Pelham Bay Park, the Bronx, (212) 885-2275.     ATMOSPHERE: Seriously beachy. Orchard Beach is New York City's last resort; at the turn of the century, it was a popular bathing spot for the affluent residents of Pelham Manor. A large, luxurious stand of trees skirts the beach, giving the place a feeling of anti-urban festivity. From a patio vantage point between the two halves of the old bathhouse, one can gaze over the entire expanse of sand and see people, umbrellas and bathers dotting the shore, as idyllic as on a picture postcard.   PEOPLE: A vibrant, ethnically mixed crowd -- children with their hair tied back with uninflated balloons, raucous teen-agers in bikinis and knee-length trunks, young families on outings.   SAND: Relatively clean and deep.   SURF: Pretty lame. Orchard Beach fronts on Long Island Sound, so there are virtually no waves. At low tide the water dissolves into muddy pebbly puddles.   BOARDWALK: Broad concrete walkway partly shaded by trees and perfect for ogling; brawny, sly-faced men sit on the backs of benches and grin at passers-by.   MUSIC: Salsa, urban dance hits, Madonna booming out of complex, multiple-component radios.   FOOD: The shopping-mall approach to dining. Two open-air food courts with a melting pot of ethnic selections -- Spanish, Greek and Italian cafes, Texas barbecue, raw bar and chowder, even a \\"Coney Island\\" vendor with hot dogs and fries. Booths inside, tables with red-and-yellow-striped umbrellas outside.   ARCADE: Yes.   DIVERSIONS: Basketball and handball courts, volleyball nets, playground; the Kazimiroff Nature Trail, a hike winding through 189 acres; a swamp-grassy area between trees with a sign that boasts \\"Natural Meadow.\\"   NEIGHBORHOOD: None. No buildings, houses or sidewalks. Orchard Beach is approachable only by lush, green, tree-lined lanes that serve to separate it physically and psychically from the grim heat wave and hustle one is leaving behind.   CLAIM TO FAME: The sand came from New Jersey in the 1930's, on barges. Rockaway Beach      7.5 miles, on the Atlantic Ocean from Beach First Street, Far Rockaway, to Beach 149th Street, Neponsit, Queens (718) 318-4000.     ATMOSPHERE: Unlike the other public beaches, Rockaway has no distinctive New York flavor; its plain plank boardwalk, pale arc of sand and high-rise condos are welcoming enough, but they could just as easily belong to Long Island, Virginia or any other point on the East Coast. That's not to say it's without character. The beautiful old buildings, nearby hotels and ornate subway station have a kind of windswept, sunburned grandeur, and the fact that it's accessible only by bridge gives it the aura of adventure and isolation.   PEOPLE: Suburban teen-agers, office workers in their 20's, bored-looking mothers, dogs with names like Champ.   SAND: Soft and dross-free close to the boardwalk. Below tide level, strewn with shells, pull tabs, some glass, the occasional broken toy.   SURF: Glorious.   BOARDWALK: Called Ocean Promenade. Nondescript. A few old-timers are scattered on benches.   MUSIC: INXS, Whitney Houston, other pop and rock hitmakers.   FOOD: The Sand Bar, an open-air, garagelike space with a fast-food counter on one side, a square bar serving draft beer in 32-ounce cups on the other.   ARCADE: Situated in a row of buildings just off the boardwalk, but boarded up, apparently for ages. \\"It never opens,\\" a woman at the food counter said sadly.   DIVERSIONS: Playground at the opposite end of the boardwalk from the main entrance.   NEIGHBORHOOD: The center of town is a cute small-business district, but the area closer to the beach has the gaunt, washed-out look of a summer community long past its prime. Cracked and peeling sign boards, rubble-filled lots; ghost buildings like Danny's Cocktail Lounge, with its shadowy interior musty and decayed from disuse, and the Hotel Lawrence, a once-gorgeous structure whose upstairs porch has fallen into seedy disrepair.   CLAIM TO FAME: \\"Rockaway Beach,\\" by the Ramones. Manhattan Beach      0.3 mile, on the Atlantic Ocean, Oriental Boulevard, from Ocean Avenue to Mackenzie Street, Brooklyn, (718) 946-1373.     ATMOSPHERE: A beach in the most generic sense of the word. Sand, jetties, picnic areas, ocean.   PEOPLE: Homeboys, teen-age girls with big hair, screaming children.   SAND: Well tended up to the tide line, where there are unnervingly large piles of debris -- twigs, driftwood, even a section of a picket fence.   SURF: Calm.   BOARDWALK: None -- just a cement sidewalk that curves around the short strip of sand.   MUSIC: Funk, rock.   FOOD: The sign on the building just reads \\"Food Concession\\" in big block letters.   ARCADE: None.   DIVERSIONS: Basketball courts.   OTHER BUILDINGS: The bathhouse is a rectangular tan-brick structure that looks like an Army barracks, except for the maple-leaf logo of the Parks and Recreation Department on the front.   NEIGHBORHOOD: Nice middle-class houses on a two-lane road.   CLAIM TO FAME: President Ulysses S. Grant dedicated the Manhattan Beach Hotel in 1877; it was demolished in World War I. Coney Island      2.5 miles, on the Atlantic Ocean, from West 37th Street to Corbin Place, Brooklyn, (718) 946-1350.     ATMOSPHERE: A seemingly endless stretch of sand, a Boardwalk offering every possible greasy food, water-squirt games, a roller coaster that defines the term death-defying, a Ferris wheel you can see from miles away at night, carnival music, the world's best hot dog, cheap beer, buildings saddened by decay, a century's worth of memories -- Coney Island has everything a beach could ever dream of. And more: Coney Island has presence, life, a tingling timelessness in its air that penetrates your skin faster and more deeply than a ray of sun. Its wondrous and strange history is horribly apparent in the crumbling walls of its old bathhouses, in its chipped tiles and peeling paint, in the blackened corpse of the Thunderbolt roller coaster. Yet even though it's lost much of its grandeur, it seems, today, somehow richer for it. Coney Island has seen more than any human being ever will. It has soul.   PEOPLE: Black, white, Puerto Rican, Asian, Indian, yuppie, drifter, tourist, hipster, lonely heart, crazy drunk, anyone and everyone.   SAND: Take off your shoes and feel it under your feet.   SURF: Venerable.   BOARDWALK: Epochal. Souvenirs like pinwheels and inflatable toys, spillover from Ruby's bar and restaurant; a view of the teeming amusement park to one side, the ocean and infinite horizon to the other.   MUSIC: Rap from the Break Dance ride, organ from the carousel, soft rock from Ruby's, and disco from boom boxes all mingle with the shrieks and thunder of the Cyclone.   FOOD: Coney Island is proud of its junk food. Gregory & Paul's, the snack joint on the Boardwalk with the Astroland rocket on top, has signs that brag of \\"hygrade frankfurters, hamburgers, french fries, hot corn, Italian sausage, seafood, frog legs, fried shrimp, cold beer, drinks, popcorn, cotton candy, ice cream, hot knishes, hot pizza, coffee cake, Italian ices, fried chicken.\\"   ARCADE: Faber's Fascination Sportland, Astroland Arcade, among other thrills.   NEIGHBORHOOD: Tawdry, desperate. On Neptune Avenue, east of Astroland, a vacant lot is set off from the road by a chain-link fence. A small, innocuous Parks and Recreation sign bears the inscription Steeplechase Park, on the site of the park that closed in 1964.   ADDED ATTRACTIONS: Sideshows by the Seashore, a museum, theater and sometime live-music venue. Recently renovated, it houses photos of freaks, memorabilia and other tributes to Coney's past lives.   CLAIM TO FAME: The most renowned and infamous beach in the world, perhaps of all history; a place where one is free, briefly, to melt time. NO SAND, NO SALTY TANG, BUT WATER, REFRESHING WATER     All outdoor pools listed are open 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. daily, with free admission, unless otherwise noted. Under Mayor David N.

The Surf. The Junk Food."},{"year":"2000","title":"Every evening, just at dusk, I carry two hay bales into the middle pasture. One goes into the high feed-bunk, the other into the feeder just below it. Each bale is bound by two strings of sisal baling twine. I cut the strings near their knots, which were tied by a mechanical baler sometime late last summer in a Massachusetts hayfield. The bale springs apart, and the hay falls into flakes. I coil the strings into a neat loop and put them in my pocket. There is at least one coil of twine in every jacket I own and another in the hip pocket of every pair of jeans. On this place, baling twine is the thread of life.     Not that it gets used for much. It ties down tarps and ties up tomato vines and rose canes. It piles up day by day in an empty grain sack or a cardboard box in the barn. The horses are easier to catch with a double length of twine-string, as my farming cousins called it, than with a proper halter, and the horses are also gentle enough to be led that way. I know ranch hands in Wyoming who never ride out without a loop of the stuff -- usually the orange plastic kind -- knotted to a saddle-string or a D-ring. It is hard to describe the emergency that only a length of baling twine would fix, but you would know it if you ever rode into one.

About New York","excerpt":"The Feeling of Security Dies in Pelham Parkway"},{"year":"1975","title":"The past never seems as frail and long gone as when it is asserting something about the future. It is the avant-garde that dies first.The point is evoked with eerie precision at a collection of four short films being shown by Film Forum to inaugurate its new premises at the Vandam Theater in SoHo. The four, all made in the nineteen-fifties, were considered more or less experimental in their day. All are interesting and two, at least, are masterpieces. But seen now, with many of their varying techniques having become familiar, the stylistic effect is a blend of charm and naiveté.In fact their real impact, and it has almost the force of shock, is not in their style but in their viewpoint.All four are in some way about New York. What stands out is the buoyancy, the sheer optimism and exuberance that this city, 20 years ago, imposed even upon those who were out to set it on its collective ear. The pictures will be shown today through Sunday and again next Thursday through Sunday.If \\"On the Road\\" was the bible of the Beat Generation, the film \\"Pull My Daisy\\" was a kind of short breviary. With a voice-over narration by Jack Kerouac and the manic participation of Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Peter Orlovsky and others, it takes the more or less formal setting of a social call and tears it into shreds.The setting is a loft somewhere south of Greenwich Village. Lofts were still symbols of freedom and boundlessness: bodies with needle marks or stab wounds hadn't begun to turn up in them. It was littered with clothes: litter was still a statement and not a universal condition. A Tiffany lamp hung in it: Tiffany lamps were still found in junkshops and hadn't made their way uptown.For the Beats the seamless stability of American life was like a field just snowed on, in which almost any kind of caper would leave a significant mark. So in \\"Daisy\\" Messrs. Ginsberg, Orlovsky and Corso, laden with beer cans bounce into the residence of Milo, a seraphic brakeman, and his long-suffering wife.The three poets are young, their hair is slept-in but short, and they sit on Milo's couch like ruffled owls while sabotaging the visit of the Bishop and his mother and sister. The bishop is only about 17: still, he manages such lines as \\"A strange and interesting evening\\" while the air is full of talk about \\"tortured socks\\" and a short oratorio about cockroaches.This is Dada: maximum shock with a minimum of pain","excerpt":"the feeling that stones could be hurled through windows and nothing would really break. Like Dada from the nastier perspective of the late nineteen-twenties, it seems innocent and touching.\\"Skyscraper,\\" made by Shirley Clarke, is a short film classic; a funny, exciting and absorbing account of the building of a skyscraper from demolition to completion.We see old facades coming down and a great hole gouged out by power shovels, and with a sudden sense of time-warp we realize that what we see as not being deprecated or condemned but celebrated. A lilting voice sings about \\"this island, light as wine.\\" Change is presented as triumph not loss, and the city is a place of limitless energies and possibilities.Using a dialogue between Murphy—a high-steel man who is the wisecracking, know-it-all New Yorker and totally capable of astonishment—and his boss, the entire process of building a skyscraper is laid out. The camera shows bedrock being hauled away—\\"They're taking New York to New Jersey,\\" Murphy protests—foundations laid, steel uprights swinging into place.The bare girders frame towering views of Manhattan. The facade is laid on and, curiously, as the building is finished it becomes less real. The irony is unmeant and is only seen now in retrospect. Because all this romance, guts and imagination, all this high-flying geometry went to produce the gimcrack banality of Fifth Avenue's Tishman Building.The other two films are less thematic: they are poetic and affectionate explorations of the beauty of the city. \\"N.Y., N.Y.\\" by Francis Thompson uses optical effects—multiple images, distortion, color-blurring — to find geometric patterns in the city's bones. A morning cup of coffee is serialized into infinity; bridge-girders zigzag, framing the sky like stained glass.A much better picture, the best of the four, in fact, is Weegee's New York, particularly its Coney Island section. Made by the photographer Weegee, it follows the day and evening through a crowded Coney Island Sunday. 4 Shorts at Film Forum a Blend of Charm and Naivete"},{"year":"1972","title":"CHICAGO, April 16 &#8212","excerpt":"The feeling that the Rangers are in the midst of something magical persisted at loud and huge Chicago Stadium tonight as the New Yorkers opened their Stanley Cup semifinal series with a 3&#8208;2 victory over the Black Hawks.

The object in question was a volume in the University of Minnesota series called \\"Theory and History of Literature\\" -- any volume, since they all looked alike and were each equally tantalizing, coming as they did in a wide variety of colors. There were Hans Robert Jauss's \\"Toward an Aesthetics of Reception\\" (pink), Paul de Man's \\"Blindness and Insight\\" (powder blue) and Jean-Francois Lyotard's \\"Postmodern Condition\\" (lurid aquamarine).

(There is even a bookstore called Verso in Manhattan, which, though technically unaffiliated with that left-wing British press, features a cultural studies section devoted almost exclusively to Verso and Routledge books.) Among the strictly academic publishers -- Routledge and Verso are not linked to universities -- Duke University Press's shrink-wrapped books probably enclose more fetish value per pound than those of any of their competitors, since their pages are hallowed by the imprimatur of no less a personage than Stanley Fish, the press's celebrity director, and such series editors as the queer-theory superstar Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and the nonfiction prose stylist Jane Kramer.

Now Allen Cohen, an editor of The Oracle, and a group of ingenious printers have brought out THE SAN FRANCISCO ORACLE FACSIMILE EDITION (Regent Press, 6020-A Adeline, Oakland, Calif. 94608, $175), a large-format reproduction of the entire run of the paper, bound in a sturdy volume. This is an admirable feat. The fantastic graphics of The Oracle, many wrapped around pages or double spreads of text, were mostly printed in black and white, but many glowed in deep reds, fuchsias, blues, oranges and yellows produced in a printing process now extinct. Regent Press has brought them back to life through what must have been maddeningly laborious handwork on the press; here indeed is the old Oracle in all its Oriental opulence. Open any page and you are back on the streets of Haight-Ashbury in a time when that tiny urban spot was the Olympus of the newborn world. The prophets were young then: Gary Snyder, Alan Watts, Timothy Leary, Allen Ginsberg, Lew Welch -- whole ranks of them are here proclaiming their new testaments under hypnotic graphic banners created by Hetti McGee, Rick and Ida Griffin, Bob Branaman and many more, some nameless but still unforgettable. In the politically treacherous and drugged chaos that was Haight-Ashbury, it is no wonder The Oracle dropped dead young; it seems a miracle that it lived even a short time. It's good to have it back.

Alvarez's ''Life After Marriage,'' I found myself wishing that he had taken his case histories of divorce from novels rather than from life, for the novelist's imagination is more likely to be generous than the voice of someone hurt, angry and bewildered.  Since divorce is so common, it seems to me that what we need is a heartening literature on the complexity, even the poetry, or the tragicomedy of the thing. It isn't all anguish - nothing ever is.  There is a considerable body of literature developing now in which the novel of divorce is becoming our new Bildungsroman, an educational adventure in which the hero or heroine is followed from a picaresque or impetuous youth to responsible, or at least ironical, adulthood. The characters in these novels marry as adolescents and divorce as adults.   Marriage represents the characters' innocence. They propose to sow the wild oats of their optimism. It's their age of faith. When they say, ''I do,'' this is an enormous boast, a dare, a promise to love heroically. In the two best novels of divorce that I know - ''Preparations for the Ascent'' by Gilbert Rogin and ''Too Far to Go'' by John Updike - the ramifications of that promise are examined.

Nothing much is left of the Ukraine but the indomitable spirit of the people, and it is that spirit which is the heart and life of \\"Ukraine in Flames,\\" the new Soviet documentary motion picture which opened on Saturday at the Stanley Theatre.The Germans buried their dead under those neat wooden crosses when time permitted, but not so the thousands upon thousands of Ukrainians whom they murdered. They were tossed into mass graves, hurriedly covered over with a few feet of soil. Others were left against the sides of ditches or piled grotesquely upon one another in the city square where they had been executed by firing squads. All this and more of the Nazis' barbaric deeds was photographed by twenty-four combat cameramen who accompanied advance units of the Red Army back into the Ukraine.That we might better realize the devastating effects of war, the film opens on the rich, abundant wheat and cotton fields, the well-kept orchards and the newly developed steel factories which were the pride of the Ukraine. And the camera wanders, too, through the ancient city of Kiev, through the bustling little towns and villages, the while the narrator briefly recounts the history of the region.

In \\"Despite CNN's Folly\\" (column, Nov. 16), he condemns Cable News Network for disobeying a judge's order restraining broadcast of audio tapes of conversations between Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the United States-deposed ruler of Panama, and his lawyers.    The Federal appeals courts have split on this very issue","excerpt":"the Fifth Circuit, which upheld the judge's order, ruled in 1972 in United States v. Dickinson that a judge's order must be obeyed, even if it is unconstitutional, while the First Circuit ruled in 1986, In Re Providence Journal, that a judge's order that is \\"transparently invalid\\" need not be obeyed.   The order of Judge William M. Hoeveler of the Federal District Court, invoking the constitutionally suspect power of prior restraint was based on the premise that broadcasting the tape might make it harder to select an impartial jury and might make the prosecution aware of defense strategies. Both assertions are absurd.   CNN is simply not big enough to taint the whole jury pool; as for tainting the prosecution, it was the Government that made the tapes. Indeed, the Noriega prosecution has been seriously, if not fatally compromised -- but not by CNN. Taping General Noriega's conversations with his lawyers has likely made a fair trial impossible. One can only speculate on the Government's motives in doing this.   Judge Hoeveler's order did not assert the \\"kind of threat to fair trial rights that would possess the requisite degree of certainty to justify restraint\\" (from Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart, the most recent Supreme Court case on this issue). In that case, the Court established conditions to justify prior restraint:    (1) the nature and extent of pretrial publicity would impair the defendant's right to a fair trial;    (2) there were no alternative measures that could mitigate the effects of the publicity, and    (3) a prior restraint would effectively prevent the harm.    Applying this test to the Noriega case leads to the inescapable conclusion that Judge Hoeveler's order is \\"transparently invalid.\\"   It was very impolite, and risky, of CNN to ignore the judge's order and broadcast the tape minutes after he issued it -- but the principle of free speech and the odium correctly attached to prior restraint of the press made the action imperative.    It seems to me that CNN's actions were not an example of arrogance, as Mr. Lewis characterizes them, but rather a courageous assertion of rights in the best American journalistic tradition. The Framers of the First Amendment did not expect the press to be tame handmaidens of government.      LARRY C. WHITE   Adjunct Prof., Journalism, N.Y.U.

Apparently when they are through with wars, proper, they spend their time in the prize-fight ring—trying to earn a little money with which to buy braces for poor, crippled children.United States Smith, as it happens, is a waif who is adopted by the company of marines of which one Steve Riley is the top-sergeant. This Riley, besides being quite a marine, is a fighter of note and (obviously) a sentimentalist. It is he, anyway, who instigates the adoption of young Smith.Things go on and on, with the polishing of buttons and the blare of bugles, until there comes the night when Riley is to fight one Corporal Jim Sharkey, a big jab and uppercut man from the army. Both of them love the same girl, a fact which is supposed to make them fight harder.Just before the battle, young Smith (who has been burned and is lying on a cot of pain) discovers that his hero, Mr. Riley, is going to throw the battle in order to make $5,000. The sergeant doesn't want it for himself, you may be sure, but only to give his young friend an education. Smith does various things about it, finally persuading Riley that the honor of the marines is more important than his own future.During the fight Smith, who gets a brooch from the girl, holds it up before his gladiator's eyes and stimulates him into such a sphere of activity that Mr. Sharkey takes the count.

In 1936, for Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson to make a movie was an act of defiance, a flouting of a supreme law of scientific seriousness, namely, that the word is mightier than the moving picture.    In the 1990's, of course, the tables have been turned. Mead and Bateson's films are hoary classics in a field, visual anthropology, that boasts its own professional journal and graduate programs. And at a time when people are increasingly dismissing traditional anthropology as a) boring or b) an advanced form of colonialism, audiences throng the American Museum of Natural History every September for the Margaret Mead Film Festival, the only American showcase of ethnographic movies. It offers four nights of film about culture -- ours, theirs or, when you get right down to it, both.    From tomorrow through Thursday, the festival will screen 46 films and offer discussions with about two dozen film makers. As in each of the 15 festivals held since 1976, the stylistic span will be broad, ranging from an ethnographic film as orthodox in its approach as the British Broadcasting Company's \\"Two Girls Go Hunting,\\" in which an anthropologist interrogates two girls from the Hamar tribe in southern Ethiopia on marriage, to a documentary that mines a quirky vein in Western culture, \\"Christo in Paris,\\" about the artist's quest to wrap the Pont Neuf in Paris. \\"Christo in Paris\\" was produced by a group that included the pioneering documentarians David and Albert Maysles (makers of \\"Salesman\\").   \\"What's important for me,\\" said Malcolm Arth, the festival chairman, \\"is not that the camera has come in with or without an anthropologist. What's important is the sense of the people themselves being depicted, that some context has been provided.\\"    Yet even as the festival basks in popularity, it is also besieged from every side, intellectual as well as financial. Philosophical challenges have arisen that may put ethnographic film makers -- at least as conventionally defined -- out of work. More immediately, as funds dry up, the festival's very survival is in question.   In the past year alone, unrenewed grants left the festival $35,000 poorer","excerpt":"the figure represents about 40 percent of the total budget. Meanwhile, Mr. Arth, who has been with the festival since its first year, retires later this week. The incoming chairman, Talbert Spence, has not yet announced his plans for next year's festival.   This year, less money means that fewer film makers will attend. And Nathaniel Johnson Jr., the museum's director of special programs, thinks that the budget crunch will make it tough for programmers to keep up with the rapidly expanding field.    A hamstrung selection process could tarnish the festival's credibility. For if any trend can be spotted in a field as motley as ethnographic film making, it is toward handing the camera over to indigenous groups who are the traditional subjects of anthropological film. And they tend to prefer the camcorder to the movie camera. \\"That's the transformative edge of the genre,\\" said Faye Ginsburg, head of New York University's ethnographic film and video program. \\"   Or, in the words of David McDougall, who with his wife, Judith, is among the better-known ethnographic film makers, \\"The question is, whose story is it?\\"   For the McDougalls (whose film, \\"Photo Wallahs,\\" a study of Indian portraiture, will be shown Wednesday), the path of recent ethnographic film history is a series of ethical U-turns. In the 1960's, tired of what Mr. McDougall called the \\"illustrated lecture,\\" the McDougalls developed a freewheeling style known as observational cinema, the ethnographic equivalent of cinema verite. But eventually that, too, galled them. \\"That fly-on-the-wall stuff is actually a very objectifying approach,\\" said Mr. McDougall.    The McDougalls then began making movies with and about Australian aborigines. Now that project has landed the couple in another ethical bind. \\"White film makers making films of advocacy on behalf of indigenous people are putting their own words into the mouths of others.\\" he said.   To make ethnographic film makers' lives even more complicated, some scholars have come to the conclusion that, as a discipline, visual anthropology simply has no reason to exist. \\"The basic idea of any film as document is that it's evidence of something,\\" said Brian Winston, documentary film historian and dean of Pennsylvania State University's School of Communication. \\"That depends critically on the idea that the photograph can be trusted. I'm not sure that, in the era of digital image manipulation, we can believe that. If the essential relationship between the photographic image and the thing it's supposed to represent is under attack, you can still live with the fiction film. You can even live with a documentary like 'Roger and Me.' But when you get into the realm of social science, you're in trouble.\\"   Whatever the ultimate value of the festival's films, most people attend simply because they like them. \\"It sounds almost ethereal in some way, but there's a feeling that some kind of truth is being discovered,\\" said Jonathan Stack, producer of \\"Damned in the USA,\\" being shown tomorrow.\\"   Were it not for the festival, it seems likely that many of these films would never be seen. \\"When you look at the programming on PBS or the Discovery Channel, a lot of those films premiered at the festival,\\" said the festival's programmer, Elaine Charnov. \\"It would be a crime if that did not continue.\\" VIEWPOINTS    The Margaret Mead Film Festival will show 46 films in four theaters over four nights, meaning that times for some films will overlap.

Man is a big, beautiful, fortyish woman with an air of unnatural serenity and almost no lines on her face, and the film has little interest in explaining how she came to be that way. Instead, it wakes up along with her, in an empathetic and purposefully somnolent style, as Mari's friendship with a younger and less patient woman helps her to realize how much of her life has parsed her by.The important thing about the friendship, as it is presented here, is its galvanizing effect.

Even its languid moments hold a certain fascination, what with Ric Waite's handsome photography and a cast that Noah might envy.The film is slow and only vaguely speculative, though, without much story to give it shape. The James brothers, played by Stacy and James Keach, and the Youngers (David, Keith and Robert Carradine), with their cohorts the Millers (Randy and Dennis Quaid), are eventually done in by the Fords (Christopher and Nicholas Guest). Though it culminates in an extravagant slow-motion bloodbath, the film largely concentrates on small, symmetrical details in the gang members' lives. They are seen romancing women who strangely resemble them, or rising from their various beds on the same morning, or engaging in a night's recreation at the local saloon. Mr. Hill weaves their gestures together with a portentous elegance that promises a great deal that it never delivers.\\"The Long Riders,\\" which opens today at the Manhattan 1 and other theaters, has at its heart a question about the resonance of legends. But this matter is addressed uncertainly, by a terse screenplay and by a few key performances that are problematically stony. The best parts of the film are those that simply summon up an atmosphere and let the actors revel in one another's company.

Superbly edited by David Holden, it has a prelude that shows the gang members inside the barn, trading quick remarks that say little but establish a sharp, vigorous rhythm. When the gunplay begins, the same rhythm seems to escalate a beat, until the episode takes on a breathless urgency. It moves at a thrilling rate, although where it's going remains indeterminate. The chief virtues of \\"The Long Riders\\" — a physical loveliness, attention to historical detail, the intermingling of all those matching faces, Ry Cooder's rousing score — make its underlying opaqueness a real disappointment.\\"The Long Riders\\" has the kind of studied simplicity that is only arrived at circuitously.

The director ANDREW WAGNER, after a decade and a half of failed feature projects, turned to his family for career salvation, casting his father, mother and sister as themselves in a fictional film about a dysfunctional New York family driving across the country. As Mr. Wagner, who at the time of making the film was teaching film to the Crips and the Bloods in South Central Los Angeles, put it: ''I was more than ready to make a film about waking up to a feeling of profound dissatisfaction with one's life.''

But the film is a milestone, nonetheless, given Wasserman's notorious penchant for secrecy. Apparently not based on a book of a similar title by DENNIS McDOUGAL, this film features Mr. Avrich's interviews with Hollywood power brokers like JACK VALENTI, ROBERT EVANS and DAVID BROWN.

Unlike most of their neighboring fellow Indians, they are traditionalists, people who want to retain their culture and their lands. The land in question consists of 24 million acres, about one third of Nevada, and they contend that the treaty they concluded with the United States in 1863 did not make any concessions to the nation that had come upon them.They have refused compensation and are threatened by Government policy, which permits thousands of trees on the land to be torn down, trees that the tribe's religion regards as sacred and that also provide food.Joel L. Freedman, producer and director of this 70-minute color film, spent two years making it. He has told it as a story of a small, menaced people, depicting their way of life, their problems, their humor, their aspirations, much of it in their own words, although Robert Redford narrates the script by Tom Schachtman.Chuck Levey's photography dramatically focuses on faces and foliage, following the Indians from the quiet of their colony to a dramatic climax in the Indians' confrontation with the Indian Claims Commission and depicting the relentless uprooting of the trees by a huge chain pulled between two tractors.\\"Broken Treaty at Battle Mountain\\" has much to say to anyone who is concerned with big against small, with preservation against \\"progress\\" and it says it well.

'Broken Treaty at Battle Mountain'"},{"year":"1995","title":"Robert Bolt, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter and playwright whose works included the films \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and \\"Dr. Zhivago\\" and the play and film \\"A Man for All Seasons,\\" died on Monday at his home near Petersfield, Hampshire, in southern England. He was 70.   He had been suffering from heart trouble for some time, said his agent, Tom Erhardt.   Though he became one of the most successful British writers of his generation, Mr. Bolt, who was born near Manchester in 1924, began his working life as a teacher in a pair of country schools. It was there that he honed his passionate love of history and language and there that his first play was produced, for a Nativity pageant. His next play, the comedy \\"Flowering Cherry,\\" was performed at the Haymarket Theater in London in 1958 and came to Broadway the next year with Wendy Hiller and Eric Portman in the lead roles.   By that time, Mr. Bolt was well into writing \\"A Man For All Seasons,\\" the now-classic exploration of the fatal confrontation between Henry VIII and his Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas More, over issues of religion, power and conscience. The play, produced in 1961 at the Globe Theater in London, was an instant hit and established Mr. Bolt as a major force in British theater. In 1962, with Paul Scofield as More, it went on to win five Tony Awards on Broadway. The 1966 film version, written by Mr. Bolt and again starring Mr. Scofield, won six Oscars, including the one for best screenplay.   Despite his success and his political activities, which included a monthlong spell in jail in 1961 after he participated in an antinuclear demonstration, Mr. Bolt resisted attempts to label him one of Britain's Angry Young Men. In truth, he said, he was \\"anxious rather than angry.\\"   It was with the director David Lean, during what is now considered British cinema's golden age, that Mr. Bolt collaborated to produce two famous epic films: \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" in 1962, starring Peter O'Toole, and \\"Dr. Zhivago,\\" two years later, starring Omar Sharif and Julie Christie.   \\"Lean relied very much on Bolt for the scripts for his films,\\" Adrian Wootton, controller of the British Film Institute at South Bank in London, told the British Press Association. \\"Without him, I don't believe 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Doctor Zhivago' would have been the great films they are.\\" \\"Dr. Zhivago\\" brought Mr. Bolt his second Academy Award. He received an Oscar nomination for \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\"   The Bolt-Lean team also produced \\"Ryan's Daughter,\\" a 1970 film that starred Mr. Bolt's on-again, off-again wife, the actress Sarah Miles.   In 1978, he suffered a severe stroke that left him partly paralyzed and forced him to relearn many of the things essential to his work, like speaking and writing. But he quit his old ways -- a taste for wine and whisky and a smoking habit that had reached 80 cigarettes a day -- saying later that \\"I decided I just couldn't face the wall and die.\\" And he continued working.   Mr. Bolt's last credited screenplay was for the 1986 film \\"The Mission,\\" directed by Roland Joffe, which he also wrote as a novel","excerpt":"the film starred Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro. At the time of his death he was in the midst of adapting Jung Chang's novel \\"Wild Swans,\\" a memoir about life in a changing China, for BBC television, and had also recently reworked \\"The Thwarting of Baron Bollingrew,\\" a children's play he wrote in 1966, into a novel for children.   Mr. Bolt was married to three women, including Miss Miles, whom he married twice. In 1949, he married his first wife, Celia Roberts, a painter. They divorced 18 years later, and he married Miss Miles. He and Miss Miles separated in 1975, and he married the actress Anne Zane. When that marriage collapsed, he secretly remarried Miss Miles, who had nursed him through much of his illness. She was with him when he died.   In addition to his wife, he is survived by four children.

However, an adviser suggests that he become acquainted with a rural church.The film follows him to a Baptist church in Mound Bayou, Miss., where he confers with an old country preacher about the intensity of religious feeling in that community. Next, he spends time at a Methodist church in Chicago, where the urban congregation airs some generational conflicts. He also visits a group of teen-agers whom a youth organizer encourages to talk about their attitudes toward death, suicide—\\"Is is a cop-out?\\"—and the assassinations of black leaders. A member of the church later objects that the organizer \\"teaches them too much black.\\"Finally, the seminarian returns to Atlanta","excerpt":"the film then intercuts between a Christian minister's sermon and a discussion with some Black Muslims who are standing outside the chapel. The minister stresses the tangible realities of black life—including the children who suffer from malnutrition \\"while the politicians thrive\\"—and he warns against an overly mystical approach to religion. Especially because the camera never seems to be intrusive, the film yields a strong sense of the varieties of religious experience that one young man has been exposed to, and the breadth of choice that confronts him.

It is a fantastic farce, almost a burlesque of farce, with a humor so elusive that this humorless corner frankly never quite caught on. The joke is primarily on the British, but we incline more to believe it is on the French and, for thinking so, they probably will howl that it's on us. But it doesn't matter much anyway: it's not too good a joke.The piece has something of the quality of \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" Every one in it is utterly mad. To mention a few, there are the man and wife suspect respectively of being murderer and victim, who go into hiding so that no one will learn that their servants had left them. (Presumably a scandal of that sort would have crushed them socially.) You will meet a sybaritic vicar who goes on a stealthy mission disguised as a kilted Highlander. There is a milkman who wears a top-hat, a Jack-the-Ripper on a bicycle, a girl who left the Salvation Army because the music was so sad, a journalist who got his best ideas in a state of tranee and a lynch-mob in London.A mood of inspired nonsense might have sustained them all. As it is, it has sustained only the vicar, played by Louis Jouvet. It leaves the others floundering in a bog of slapstick and burlesque in which only Michel Simon seems at home. But one thing we will concede the picture: it is bizarre.At the 48th Street TheatreIt is a safe bet that if anybody except the Scandinavians had turned out a picture beginning with the first line of their national anthem, the result would have been \\"glorification\\" of their native land from start to finish. Such is not the case with \\"Du Gamla, Du Fria\\" (Thou old, Thou free), the new Swedish importation at the Forty-eighth Street Theatre.Despite the fact that they have much to boast about, the Swedish film folk have contented themselves with an enjoyable, natural account of the home-coming of a fairly prosperous Swedish-American (Sigurd Wallen), accompanied by his charming American-born niece (Karin Ekelund) and his substantial and amusing housekeeper (Dagmar Ebbesen). Particularly effective is his meeting with his aged mother (Hilda Borgstroem). Young Karl-Arne Holmsten, as a Stockholm newspaper man immediately interested in the fair American, is almost as good as the well-known principals. Because the ending is somewhat in doubt it should not be revealed in advance.Gunnar Olsson directed the film for the Europa concern. The supposed semi-American characters and the English they use are much more realistic than those encountered in most foreign pictures.At the Broadway Cine RomaA fast-moving tale of a mysterious explosive, international spies, secret service agents and, of course, love, is the new offering from Italy at the Broadway Cine Roma. The program proudly avers that \\"Lotte nell 'Ombra\\" (Battles in the Shadow) is \\"the first big adventure film made in the American style on an Italian idea.\\" It is all of that. Domenico M. Gambino, who directed it for the Esperia Film Company, makes good use of a competent cast and first-class technical equipment.Renato Cialente's good looks are not allowed to prevent him from being utterly horrible as the conspirator (with a Russian name) who stops at nothing in his attempt to discover the secret formula of the new death-dealing compound. Pretty Paola Dria is the girl who knows the recipe, while Antonio Centa is the main agent of the government (presumably Italian) engaged in blocking the nefarious plot. There are several other active principals. The sea setting is fine.

Others came as well: his wife, the actress Giulietta Masina, of course","excerpt":"the filmmaker and writer Pier Paolo Pasolini; the novelist Alberto Moravia; and a dashing actor named Marcello Mastroianni, to name a few. In this golden age, Fregene, once a simple fishing village, became an oasis for Italian intellectuals and Rome's fashionable Via Veneto crowd.      Fellini, Pasolini and Mastroianni are all gone, and the glamour associated with Fregene faded over the years. But now a new group of celebrities and glamorous young people have rediscovered the town for the same reasons it drew sun seekers 40 years ago: it is a quick getaway from Rome and an upscale alternative to the congested beaches of nearby Ostia. Throughout the summer, actors, soccer stars and the Roman gentry come here to feast in waterfront restaurants, to dance until the wee hours and, most of all, to tan themselves on the beaches.

By Steven Locke and Douglas Colligan. Foreword by Norman Cousins. 272 pp. New York: E. P. Dutton. $22.50. IF the title of this book is somewhat misleading -the authors are more concerned to document the effect of psychosocial factors on disease than to show us how we can heal ourselves - the subtitle is simply remarkable. For a very long time, it has been clear that the Cartesian separation of mind and body was a philosophical fiction. (In non-Western cultures, Descartes would have been laughed out of the room.) As a practical matter, dualism has been refuted by the successful use of biofeedback, faith healing, placebos, and hypnosis, among other things. But only recently has medical science begun to take official notice that attitude and temperament are intertwined with neurobiological phenomena. Thus the straight-faced reference to a new medicine of mind and body.   Despite their conviction that our medicine is insufficiently holistic, Dr. Steven Locke, who teaches in the psychiatry department at the Harvard Medical School, and Douglas Colligan, a senior editor at Omni magazine, are hardly iconoclasts. The reader of ''The Healer Within'' is cautioned immediately that ''all matters regarding your health require medical supervision''","excerpt":"the final chapters are disdainful of therapies not carried out under the supervision of physicians. In between, though, the authors present a review of research that must shake the faith of the most intransigent dualist.

These interconnected, elliptical stories, by a Haitian-American writer, capture a bitter history of corruption and violence.

Danticat constructs the shadowy Dew Breaker through the eyes of others","excerpt":"the final story recounts his torture and murder of a dissident preacher. Moving seamlessly between 1960's Haiti and present-day New York, the novel conveys the Haitian people's torment with ''terrifying wit and flowered pungency,'' Richard Eder wrote in the Book Review.    BOBBY FISCHER GOES TO WAR: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match of All Time, by David Edmonds and John Eidinow. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $13.95.) Edmonds and Eidinow present an exciting account of the 1972 showdown in Reykjavik, Iceland, between the reigning world champion, Boris Spassky, and Fischer, the volatile American genius. The authors profile both men, and analyze the pressure each faced as cold war competitors.    SOMEONE TO RUN WITH, by David Grossman. Translated by Vered Almog and Maya Gurantz. (Picador, $14.) In this heartfelt tale, Grossman, a prominent Israeli novelist, immerses readers in the misfortunes of his country's young, drug-addicted runaways. Assaf, a shy teenage boy, is asked to return a dog to its young owner; revisiting its usual haunts, the remarkable animal leads Assaf on a picaresque quest through an underground of street artists and criminals.    THE COMING OF THE THIRD REICH, by Richard J. Evans. (Penguin, $18.) An enormous work of synthesis, this first part of a planned three-volume history of Nazi Germany explores the Weimar Republic's collapse in the wake of World War I and Hitler's rise to power in the early 1930's. ''The death of democracy in Germany was part of a much broader European pattern in the interwar years,'' Evans writes, ''but it also had very specific roots in German history and drew on ideas that were part of a very specific German tradition.'' Our reviewer, Mark Mazower, called this account ''knowledgeable and reliable. . . . It highlights the interconnections between politics and society.''    BLINDSIDED: Lifting a Life Above Illness. A Reluctant Memoir, by Richard M. Cohen. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) Cohen, a former television producer, writes unflinchingly about his battle with multiple sclerosis, first diagnosed when he was 25. Cohen describes coping with chronic illness (he has also suffered two bouts of colon cancer), the strain placed on his marriage and family, and the professional silence he maintained about his condition.    CROFTON'S FIRE, by Keith Coplin. (Berkley, $13.) Coplin's jaunty first novel follows Lt. Michael Crofton, a reluctant hero who survives Little Bighorn in 1876 and fights Spaniards in Cuba and the Zulu in South Africa -- all with a wise ambivalence about the absurdities of war.    FOOD, INC.: Mendel to Monsanto -- the Promises and Perils of the Biotech Harvest, by Peter Pringle. (Simon & Schuster, $13.) Pringle deftly surveys the battles over genetically altered food, from safety and environmental concerns to the increasing dominance of biotech companies, and weighs in with admonitions to both sides. In the Book Review, Greg Critser said Pringle hones the issues ''with the eye of a curious traveler; he's a man who sees this colorful cast of academic climbers, corporate suits, English seed-huggers and Indian firebrands as a giant circus of savants.''    THE CLOSING OF THE WESTERN MIND: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason, by Charles Freeman. (Vintage, $16.95.) This highly readable account of the development of Christian doctrine argues that the Greek intellectual tradition did not fade away but was actively suppressed. A central figure in Freeman's story is the Roman emperor Constantine, whose embrace of Christianity in the fourth century seems to have been a matter of political expediency. In FREETHINKERS: A History of American Secularism (Owl/ Holt, $16), Susan Jacoby traces more than 200 years of secularist activism, beginning with Jefferson and Madison, and calls it ''one of the greatest unresolved paradoxes of American history'' that religion occupies such an important place in a nation founded on the separation of church and state.
