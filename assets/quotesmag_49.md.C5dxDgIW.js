He would complain publicly and frequently about being the prisoner of a single role and an unchanging formula, but the money and the power, which he wielded with aplomb, proved irresistible. He died at 76 in September, his last performing effort devoted to still another \\"Perry Mason\\" case, part of a series of periodic two-hour features carried on NBC since 1985.    Tonight's \\"Perry Mason: The Case of the Killer Kiss\\" involves, appropriately enough, a gaggle of soap-opera denizens, one of them murdered, the rest suspects. Created in a series of best-selling novels by Erle Stanley Gardner, the lawyer and author, the defense lawyer Perry Mason moved on to radio in 1943 where, for 12 years, five days a week, he was a character in a series that was part soap opera, part detective story. When that series was adapted in 1956 for television as the afternoon soap \\"The Edge of Night,\\" the characters were given new names. The name Perry Mason was reserved for the Raymond Burr weekly series that would run until 1966.    \\"The Killer Kiss\\" hews to basic cookie-cutter form. Several characters are brought together, in this instance working on a soap opera. One is always abrasive or worse, and he or she will wind up the murder victim. The police pounce on a prime suspect, who often turns out to have some acquaintance with Perry Mason (\\"Her father was a judge,\\" he will casually explain, \\"her mother a law clerk\\").    He takes the case, begins his investigation and, by the time of trial, everyone in the immediate vicinity is looking suspicious. His devoted secretary, Della Street, played from the beginning by Barbara Hale, can always be depended on for some motherly hovering. In increasing pain over the years from assorted ailments, the rather massive Mr. Burr is almost always sitting or leaning on some sturdy prop.    The trial unfolds with the inevitability of Greek drama. Viewers are assured of a tidy beginning, middle and end. The prosecuting attorney opens with overweening confidence but, inasmuch as Perry Mason has lost only one trial over all these years -- in 1963, and only because his client refused to enter evidence that would save her -- viewers are hardly in doubt about the outcome.    Even the judges, apparently awed by basso-voiced authority, are prone to give Perry Mason unusual courtroom leeway. And when the lawyer's investigative assistant rushes into the courtroom with the latest piece of uncovered evidence, it's only a matter of minutes before the true culprit blurts out something like: \\"He was going to take it all. I couldn't let him do that.\\" Tonight's final installment, starring a slew of real soap-opera actors, doesn't miss a well-worn trick.    Like Eugene O'Neill's father doomed to playing the Count of Monte Cristo for much of his professional career, Raymond Burr may well have felt suffocated by the role of Perry Mason. The problem is that Mr. Burr did it to perfection, even when on automatic pilot. For a while in the early 1970's, he did some wheelchair sleuthing as \\"Ironside,\\" but that was just riding on Perry Mason's coattails.    CBS tried to revive the \\"Perry Mason\\" series in 1973 with Monte Markham in the title role. No way. Mr. Burr had put a lock on the property. The actor and the role were bonded forever. It's one way, and certainly not the worst, to live the always precarious life of a performer.

However, in asserting that it can and should be used to replace new centralized power plants, he either overlooks or ignores a few salient points.    * Mandating that utilities purchase co-generated power in lieu of building their own plants will in effect restrict them to future capacity based on oil and gas (the fuels used in industrial boilers), thereby reversing the efforts of utilities to move away from those expensive fuels. Although oil and gas are at present abundant and relatively stable in price, is it wise to assume that those conditions will continue indefinitely, and prevent the utilities from adding coal- and nuclear-generated capacity?

In a ruling in September, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said the state's Department of Environmental Quality Engineering, which had held more than three years of hearings on the project, erred when it failed to consider the possible carcinogenic effects of particulates that might be emitted from the plant's smokestack. The court ordered the agency to hold further hearings.   The 73-megawatt plant, which would be diesel-powered, is in the Mission Hill section of Boston, and the suit that led to the court order was brought by local residents and the neighboring town of Brookline.

The present favoritism comes from the statutory provision that co-op and condominium apartment buildings must be valued as if they were rental apartment buildings, rather than on the basis of their actual market value, which is the sum of the probable sales prices of the individual units in the open market. There are few, if any, co-op buildings in this city that are not worth at least twice as much in co-op status as they would be in rental status, and many co-op buildings are worth five or more times as much as co-ops as they would be as rental buildings. This is not surprising, for it is hard to make profits operating rental housing in New York.
