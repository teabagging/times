But the Orchestra of St. Luke's, one of the city's busiest freelance bands, has established a distinct identity over the last decade. Its playing is tight, polished and vigorous, and its musicians sound fully at ease in a broad stretch of the repertory.    Tonight at 9, one of the orchestra's sub-configurations, the Chamber Orchestra of St. Luke's, is playing an all-Bach concert in the Spanish Courtyard at the Caramoor Music Festival, on Girdle Ridge Road in Katonah, N.Y.

This is a tame little color travelogue of only mild interest, considering its feature length.Photographed and narrated by Paul Delmer, a British journalist, the picture very unpretentiously records the highlights of a sixteen-week trailer trip by Mr. Delmer, his wife and three children. The excursion must have been a pleasant one but, judging by what we see here, not especially fascinating.With Mr. Delmer supplying a cordial, rather homespun, narration, the footage follows the family from Moscow to Yalta and back. Mr. Delmer is an able photographer. Unfortunately, many of the family stop-offs have been visited before by expert Soviet camera men.This is particularly noticeable during the entire Moscow portion, for instance. Most of the picture simply shows the Delmers gliding over various changing countrysides, continually chatting with friendly Russians, and now and then looking in on a school, factory or national shrine.Far and away the most absorbing portion is a visit with Mr. and Mrs. Paul Robeson in Yalta, a seaside resort that steals the show. The close glimpses of the noted singer, as he relaxes in a garden and gives a concert for children, show a tired, determined-looking man.Mr. Delmer ends his travelogue with a brief speech contending that the Soviet Union and the United States can and must live in peace. Fair enough, but the picture Mr. Delmer brought back is as unenlightening as it is unstudied.

The cardinals, who had been called to Rome to discuss preparations for Christianity's next millennium, endorsed an appeal by John Cardinal O'Connor of New York for the Cairo conference -- regarded by the Clinton Administration, American feminists and population experts as a pivotal opportunity to enhance the status of women -- to avoid \\"cultural imperialism\\" that would lead to abortion on demand, sexual promiscuity and distortions of traditional family values. Coming only weeks after the Pope himself used stern language to repudiate any talk of women in the priesthood, the cardinals' action seemed to offer one more confirmation that the Vatican is crusading against what it sees as a pervasive feminist challenge.
