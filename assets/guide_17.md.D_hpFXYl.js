Young Illustrated. 386 pages. HarperCollins. $25. Where the Domino Fell America and Vietnam, 1945 to 1990 By James S. Olson and Randy Roberts Illustrated. 321 pages. St. Martin's Press. $19.95.   It's a measure of their meaning for today that two strongly opinionated but well-documented new histories of the Vietnam War include the same dates in their subtitles: 1945 to 1990. They emphasize that Vietnam resulted from the cold war and that its effects still linger in the United States, Southeast Asia and in other embattled corners of the world.    Inevitably, the authors of both books -- \\"The Vietnam Wars\\" by Marilyn B. Young, a professor of history at New York University, and \\"Where the Domino Fell\\" by James S. Olson, chairman of the history department at Sam Houston State University, and Randy Roberts, professor of history at Purdue University -- hear echoes of the Vietnam war in the Persian Gulf.    \\"Why are we in the Middle East?\\" Professor Young wonders in a preface written before the war with Iraq. \\"As of now, President Bush and his Administration have told us that we are there to control the source of 'our' oil and through that to protect our very way of life. They have invoked Munich and transcendent principles of territorial integrity. I do not suggest any comparison between Southeast Asia and the Middle East or between Vietnam and Iraq. But we had better look very closely at how we approach this or any other intervention.\\"    And she goes on to make this criticism of the military thunder in Washington and Baghdad: \\"Watching the Iraq crisis unfold as I read the galleys of this book seemed to provide it with a new, harsher and unwanted conclusion: that war continues to be a primary instrument of American foreign policy and the call to arms a first response to international disputes.\\"      Professors Olson and Roberts lay their cards face up on the table in a preface that frankly says: \\"The Vietnam War was the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time. War is, above all else, a political event. Wars are won only when political goals are achieved. Military firepower and troops are -- like diplomacy and money -- essentially tools to achieve political objectives. The United States went into Indochina after World War II with imprecise, muddled objectives. It departed in 1975 after a 30-year effort with a political focus just as blurred as it was in the beginning. The war was unwinnable because the United States never decided what it was trying to achieve politically.\\"    Of the two books, \\"Where the Domino Fell\\" is the more useful as a reference work because it includes a good chronology and an interpretive bibliography of the many works that have been recognized (after some of their authors were first maligned for not being on the White House war team) as classics of reporting and history.    The authors praise the books of three former correspondents of The New York Times: \\"The Making of a Quagmire\\" and \\"The Best and the Brightest\\" by David Halberstam, \\"My Lai\\" by Seymour Hersh and \\"A Bright Shining Lie\\" by Neil Sheehan.  Other books singled out are \\"Vietnam: A History\\" by Stanley Karnow and \\"The Ten Thousand Day War\\" by Michael Maclear and Peter Arnett (Mr. Arnett, the respected former Associated Press reporter, has enhanced his reputation as a daring journalist by staying on in Baghdad for the Cable News Network).     By taking the long view, both histories remind a new generation of readers that Vietnam was not only Lyndon Johnson's war and Richard Nixon's war but John F. Kennedy's war, too. The policies of these Presidents led to the 58,175 names on the war memorial in Washington. Neither \\"Where the Domino Fell\\" nor \\"The Vietnam Wars\\" gives any comfort to revisionist historians who surmise that President Kennedy and his best and brightest would not have continued to take the United States deeper into the quagmire.    A chapter in \\"Where the Domino Fell\\" called \\"The New Frontier in Vietnam, 1961-1963\\" begins with a boast by Robert F. Kennedy in 1962: \\"We are going to win in Vietnam. We will remain here until we do win.\\" The reader is reminded that the warrior tone was heard most loudly, during all the decades of the cold war, in President Kennedy's inaugural address when he famously warned: \\"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty.\\" More than 15,000 American military personnel were introduced into Vietnam by the Kennedy Administration.    At the end of her book -- which is more conscious of the need for Presidents to be wary of future military adventures -- Professor Young writes: \\"Ronald Reagan jettisoned Carter's human rights policy and set out on a more direct and less expensive approach to healing spiritual wounds: he renamed them. The United States invasion of Vietnam was a 'noble cause,' the American-paid mercenaries in Nicaragua were 'freedom fighters.' In one press conference he rewrote the history of Vietnam itself, informing reporters that it had always been two countries that France had liberated after World War II and whose possible reunification was disrupted by Ho Chi Minh's refusal to participate in elections.\\"    Coming up to the present, \\"The Vietnam Wars\\" discusses President Reagan's 1983 invasion of the tiny island of Grenada and the bombing of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's headquarters in Libya in 1986. In 1989 President Bush invaded Panama to remove a former ally who had fallen out of favor. And in the summer of 1990, Professor Young writes, \\"President Bush's rapid millitary buildup in Saudi Arabia seemed directed not only at Iraq but also at a war-phobic American public.\\" Books of The Times","excerpt":"2 Versions of the Long View of the Vietnam War"},{"year":"1958","title":"Next to the sections known as the Ordinary of the Mass there is probably no religious text that has been set to music so frequently as Todi's \\"Stabat Mater.\\" Two of those settings--one from the eighteenth century and a contemporary one--were presented Tuesday night at Clarion Concerts' second program of the season at Town Hall.

In such instances, we generally make the more conservative choice. It is then possible to revisit the restaurant and increase the rating if appropriate, a more cheerful task than having to take away a star already given.   Of the many restaurants reviewed this year, two stand out as examples of such a situation: Trastevere, the very original little Italian restaurant on 83d Street just east of Second Avenue, and the sophisticated Vienna Park, on 60th Street between Madison and Park Avenues. Both received two stars. But a third star seemed so implicit in each kitchen's performance that we checked back several times and can now report that those promises have been fulfilled.   Both the 15-month-old Trastevere and the nine-month-old Vienna Park are already so solidly successful that they offer object lessons to anyone contemplating entry into this precarious business.  Both have succeeded by being strongly original and individualistic instead of trying to be all things to all eaters. This is an encouraging departure at a time when too many restaurateurs with no food background or point of view hire consultants to establish the style of their establishments, Restaurants","excerpt":"2 VERY GOOD PLACES NOW EVEN BETTER; 2 very good places now even better."},{"year":"1961","title":"Buys 2 ships from Luckenbach SS NEW CONCERN BUYS LUCKENBACH SHIPS","excerpt":"2 Vessels Bring $1.6 Million -- Both Are Scheduled to Be Grain Carriers"},{"year":"1958","title":"Fog over the New York metropolitan area yesterday morning slowed highway, harbor and air traffic.

Producers knew where some of their most reliable clientele was: on Seventh Avenue, bearing expense accounts. So they perennially served these steady customers such fare as \\"The Fifth Season,\\" \\"Seidman and Son\\" and \\"I Can Get It for You Wholesale.\\" But that was another theater and another garment industry. Why is the Circle Repertory Company, the Off Broadway home of such playwrights as Lanford Wilson and Craig Lucas, reviving the genre at its most trivial on the eve of 1992?    Don't look for answers here. \\"The Rose Quartet,\\" as the Circle Rep's offering is called, makes no more sense as either commerce or art than did this company's other boulevard play of the year, \\"The Balcony Scene,\\" which, like this one, told of the mating dance of urban apartment dwellers. This time we watch the heartwarming story of two widows, one a lifetime worker in ladies' hats, who become Upper West Side roommates and try to snare two single male neighbors who are partners in a long-running ribbon business. Were it not for the late-in-the-evening revelation that the two elderly gentlemen are discreetly gay -- an off-the-rack effort to be with it -- there is nothing in the play that might not have appeared in a bygone vehicle for Menasha Skulnik, Sam Levene or Gertrude Berg.

The differences were largely in degree and perhaps self-confidence. Mr. Bassett's music pleads for attention, wringing from its moment in the spotlight every bit of breathless mystery and white-knuckle drama it can. Timpani and brass make sure we stay awake.
