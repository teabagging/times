Down below us, the Johnsons -- the small, rotating-member chamber ensemble that regularly accompanies Antony -- were chatting and tuning up, getting ready to record a few songs for Radio 1. Antony had his laptop open, and he was watching a video of his recent appearance on ''Later,'' an influential British TV music program whose host is Jools Holland, who used to be in the band Squeeze. I watched over his shoulder. There on the screen was Antony, in the long brunette hair extensions he has been wearing lately, the straight Karen Carpenter hair framing his gentle, full-moon face. He sang from the piano in his signature high quaver -- ''Hope there's someone/Who'll take care of me/When I die","excerpt":"will I go?/Hope there's someone/Who'll set my heart free. . . . ''     ''Hope There's Someone'' is the first song on his second album, ''I Am a Bird Now,'' which was released in January. Like most of his songs, it has the pace and intimacy of breathing. And like most of his songs, it's a sad song. Over two full-length records, two EP's and a series of downtown New York plays and stage shows going back 15 years, Antony has often returned to a kind of soulful, melancholic pining -- for lost friends, dead loves and especially for transformation. Antony, 34, sings often of wanting to become a spirit or to grow wings, to be set loose from a world where he is alone. Or of wanting to become a woman. Gender is a recurring note of disappointment for Antony -- not necessarily his own, but the fact of it. Someday, he announces in a song called ''For Today I Am a Boy,'' he will grow up to be a beautiful woman, and in his voice you hear the word ''woman'' as an embodiment of all the wisdom and power and fearlessness of his idol, Nina Simone. But for today, he then responds in tender resignation, he remains a child, a work in progress: a boy.

She had come to New York from Haiti 25 years ago, taken a job in a Long Island factory that made plastic bags and began laying the foundation for a new life for her family in New Cassel, a working-class enclave in central Nassau County that is home to many Haitian emigres. Two years later, she was joined here by her husband, Pierre, a soft-spoken carpenter from Arcahaie (pronounced Ar-ca-YE), the small rural village 20 miles northwest of Port-au-Prince where they had both grown up. And three years after that came a reunion with their three children (twin daughters, Cynthia and Dolores, were born later) who had been living with relatives in Arcahaie.

Today, in the spirit of the holiday season, we share our expertise.     I plan on being big, really big. When I am, is there one must-have accessory?    Call us old-fashioned, but we believe that nothing beats having a stunning model attached to your arm, preferably without the aid of surgery.     Consider GEORGE CLOONEY, a star of ''Ocean's Twelve.'' At the after-party at the Ballroom in Los Angeles, Mr. Clooney, in tuxedo, loosened his bow tie and relaxed behind a plate of lox, caviar and Melba toast -- yes, such details will be noted when you are a superstar. Meantime, LISA SNOWDON gently petted Mr. Clooney's left arm and shoulder and rubbed his neck. When asked what she loved about Mr. Clooney -- which is, of course, the only appropriate question to ask the model girlfriend of a really big movie star -- she blushed.    ''He's crazy, loopy and fantastically funny,'' Ms. Snowdon said, as Mr. Clooney look at her adoringly. Looking adoringly at the beloved, while meeting reporters, is essential. If you do not have an adoring significant other, you may practice by standing in front of a mirror.    I plan on being big, really big. When I am, how will I be able to show that despite my stupefying good looks, enormous wealth and thundering talent, I don't take myself too seriously?     An excellent question, for it involves a charming persona no reporter can resist. For guidance, look to the master, by whom we mean Mr. Clooney.    His response, for example, when asked how he dealt recently with a ruptured disk:     ''I found JACK DANIEL'S and painkillers to be a perfect combination,'' Mr. Clooney said, deadpan. ''I recommend it to all the kids out there.''     Or his answer when asked about working with his ''Ocean's Twelve'' co-stars, who include BRAD PITT, MATT DAMON, DON CHEADLE, BERNIE MAC, ANDY GARCIA, CATHERINE ZETA-JONES, BRUCE WILLIS and JULIA ROBERTS. Again, a sideways grin is essential to delivery:     ''I didn't like them. We didn't actually ever work together. First of all, Julia's not really pregnant. That was all made up.''    Then, ''We're a good-looking bunch. We had a lot of fun. These guys are very cocky, though.''    I plan on being big, really big. But how do I look as ravishing on the red carpet as, say, TÉA LEONI, at the L.A. premiere of ''Spanglish.'' What's the secret to her style?    Amazing you should ask, because that was exactly our question to Ms. Leoni: What's the secret to your style? She appreciated the depth of our question, of course, chuckling so loudly the entire red carpet took notice.    ''Somebody else comes over and does it,'' Ms. Leoni said. ''That's the secret. If I had been left with a mascara wand and blush I would look like something out of Kiss.''     I would just like to tell you that your column about the hawk was the most vulgar, insensitive, bad thing that you have ever written, and that's saying a lot since you write a lot of bad garbage. But a lot of people in New York who were born and raised here and lived here all their lives love those hawks and for you to make light of this issue in your stupid manner is really offensive and I will cancel my subscription to The Times because of that article and I will also write to your boss.    Oops, sorry. Wrong stack of mail.     I plan on being big, really big.

Of course, Mr. D'Ambrosio brought his mask.    That couldn't help but make a big, really big, impression. Props to the TV exec who came up with the idea! But I am devoted to ''Access Hollywood'' and I don't remember seeing Mr. D'Ambrosio in his mask.    Copyright issues prevented him from wearing his mask on camera, he said.
