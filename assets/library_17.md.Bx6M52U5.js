It presents the kind of happiness that needs constant stimulation — an embarrassingly artificial joy. In it the silver lining shines again and the long-lost father comes home to roost and forgive. And the silver-haired mother reconciles the angry sweetheart, while the villainess repents in a last scene that is probably the most bromidic and sickly sweet of those seen here in weeks.The happy ending is the climax of a series of events that represents some of the least important histrionic efforts of the screen. Ted Lewis may blow a \\"hot\\" clarinet, but as an actor he is as naïve as the song sung of him in the last sequence when a voice off screen croons: \\"Come on, Teddy, your dinner's ready—then off to beddy.\\"\\"Teddy,\\" looking not a day past 40, should have known better.But what can be expected of a high-hatted Pagliacci—a trouper who \\"goes on\\" though his heart is breaking? Disowned by his parents and deserted by his sweetheart, a typical motion picture girl who hears only the worst half of conversations and reasons like a moron on a mental holiday, he troups.\\"Is Everybody Happy?\\" may be taken as a musical tragi-cartoon with a message. It teaches that jazz is America's way of expressing herself and that the old classics are gone. Even Ted's father, a once-famous musician who had a violin presented to him by Franz Joseph, admits it and realizes that his boy, who has sacrificed a career with the fiddle for the more lucrative company of a clarinet, is a greater person in singing \\"I'm the Medicine Man for the Blues, Vo-do-deo-do.\\"Ted is a good son. He brings money home to his mamma by climbing up the fire escape and shouting \\"Stromberries!\\" so that the sweet little old lady will know that her son is there.This photoplay is a series of pictorial and musical platitudes inexpertly strung together. \\"HAPPINESS\\" A LA CARTE.","excerpt":"Ted Lewis Plays Artificial Role in a Weak Sound Film."},{"year":"1928","title":"Floor leased to Ted Lewis-Shopera, Inc LEFCOURT LEASES FLOOR.","excerpt":"Ted Lewis-Shopera, Inc., Takes Space in New Clothing Centre."},{"year":"1974","title":"ST.

Those on the island for two weeks can play a different course nearly every day, something few other islands in the Caribbean can boast. Puerto Rico doesn't just offer quantity either, as several courses are of championship caliber. But that  quality comes at a price. Greens fees typically range from $50 to $150 (although one can play a nine-hole public course for less than $10), and the preponderance of resort courses means that players who are not guests at the respective hotels pay much more. And such courses usually require renting motorized carts, a policy that may or may not speed up play, but one that certainly irritates purists.         Cost appears to price out many local residents. On an island of 3.7 million people, only about 2,600 are registered with the Puerto Rico Golf Association, according to Jim Teale, the executive secretary.

Almost half said they had changed behaviors -- from changing groups of friends to avoiding parks  to missing school -- as a reaction to fears of crime. Teen-agers overwhelmingly  said they were willing and eager to take part in activities or programs aimed at combatting crime.

It is a most pervasive ideal.\\"   My words were: \\"We live in a conjugal age, when the couple has become the standard for all intimate relationships, the unmarried and the married, the homosexual as well as the heterosexual.

Neil McKendrick replies:     Mr. Gillis is certainly owed an attribution and an apology. I feel this doubly so because I have never read his book. In view of the pronounced echoes of his words in the first three sentences of my review, it would be difficult to believe that I have not read them -- or some version of them -- quoted somewhere else. Clearly they have lodged all too vividly in my subconscious memory. Now that I know their origin, I am very happy to acknowledge that source.

I enjoy drinking vintage port wine and am interested in exploring the Douro Valley of Portugal, perhaps during the harvest. -- Ken Zignorski, Butler, N.J.     A.  The grapes that produce port wine are grown in the section of the valley of the Douro River starting 62 miles upstream from Oporto and three miles south and 16 miles north along the river, to the border with Spain. There is a concentration of vineyards from Peso da Regua eastward along the steep, terraced sides of the Douro and its tributaries.    The grapes are usually harvested in late September and early October. During the harvest, women and children pick grapes and the men carry large baskets of them up and down the steep slopes. The grapes are no longer trod underfoot on a large scale, though some estates crush some that way for the benefit of tourists.    Information on visits to vineyards is available at the tourist office in Oporto at 25 Rua Clube dos Fenianos","excerpt":"telephone (02) 312740. In Peso da Regua a tourist office on Caldas do Moledo, (054) 23846, and one beside the train station on Largo da Estacao, (054) 22864, also have information.  (The country code for Portugal is 351. When calling from inside Portugal drop the initial zero in the area code.)    About 14 miles upriver from Peso da Regua is the town of Pinhao, near a number of vineyards. One company that produces port wine, A. A. Calem & Filho, owns the Quinta da Foz there. Through the company, visitors can reserve a guest room in the Casa das Pontes next door for $62 a night.  A. A. Calem & Filho, 7 Rua de Reboleira, 4000 Oporto, Portugal; telephone (02) 2004867.

Cockburn, Smithes & Company, 13 Rua das Coradas, Vila Nova de Gaia; (02) 394031.   In Vila Nova de Gaia, the Adriano Ramos-Pinto company is open for visits. The offices are maintained in the turn-of-the-century style and there is a museum of port wine posters. It is at 380 Avenida Ramos Pinto; (02) 300716.   Tours can be arranged at Warre & Company through its offices at 85 Travessa Barao de Forrester, 4400 Vila Nova de Gaia; contact Maria Luzia Morgado at (02) 396063.    Tour companies in the United States experienced in travel to Portugal can arrange trips that will include air fare, accommodations in the port wine area and rental car. One is Abreu Tours, 317 East 34th Street, New York, N.Y. 10016; (800) 223-1580 or (212) 661 0555. The cost per person in double occupancy would be about $1,635 for a nine-day trip, the company says.

The Irish Parliament, known as the Dail, sits on Tuesday from 2:30 to 9 P.M., Wednesday from 10:30 A.M. to 9 P.M. and Thursday from 10:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. It goes into recess for July through September, for about three weeks at Christmas and three weeks at Easter, probably the last week in March and the first two weeks in April this year.

Smith, Houston     A.  The Marche aux Puces, in St.-Ouen just over the northern boundary of Paris, is by far the biggest flea market in the area, with more than 2,500 shops and stalls in several buildings over 23 square blocks. Though the name means flea market, it features fine antiques and designer furniture, along with traditional flea-market bric-a-brac. Among the sections of the market, the Marche Vernaison at 99 Rue de Rosiers and 136 Avenue Michelet offers Second Empire furniture, English furniture, silver, objets d'art, toys and dolls. Marche Paul-Bert, at 16 Rue Paul-Bert, sells Art Deco and turn-of-the-century antiques. Marche Jules-Valles, with entrance at 5 Rue Jules-Valles, has Art Deco objects, old photos, toys, postcards and gadgets. Marche Mailik (60 Rue Jules-Valles) has vintage clothing.The market is open Saturday, Sunday and Monday, roughly from 7:30 A.M. to 7 P.M., though hours vary among shops, some of which close for lunch. Metro: Porte-de-Clignancourt.

What sort of event is it? -- Carl H. Snyder, Miami     A.  Hogmanay (hog-ma-NAY) is what Scots call New Year's Eve. Hogmanay -- the derivation of the word is hazy -- is celebrated in a variety of ways in Scotland, and almost everyone takes part in one way or another. Hotel personnel or Scottish acquaintances are likely to know what is going on locally.    One tradition is called first-footing, in which the first person to enter a house after midnight is considered a portent for the coming year. The best omen is when the first person is a dark-haired man. In some parts of the country, that visitor brings along a piece of coal, which is put on the house's fire, and some whisky. In most communities first-footing consists of rounds of visits by friends from house to house after midnight, with the visitors bringing along whisky, wine or other spirits.   In some areas there are outdoor bonfires or, in an ancient tradition to ward off evil spirits, torchlight processionals led by bands. In Edinburgh, people gather in front of the Tron Kirk, the 17th-century church on High Street, and when the clock strikes midnight there is much hugging and kissing, and sharing of New Year's wishes and bottles. As the celebration can get spirited, it is suggested that revelers not wear their best clothes.    In Glasgow there is a celebration in George Square from 10:30 P.M. to 1:30 A.M., with Scottish music and dancing. There is no charge to attend, but participants must have tickets so as to limit the number to 15,000. No refreshments are sold, so people bring their own. For information on how to get tickets: Festival Press Center, William Teacher Building, 14 Street, Enoch Square, Glasgow G14 B7","excerpt":"telephone (041) 2277 5862 or 5987.   Most bars in Scotland have a celebration. According to an Edinburgh tourist official, visitors should be aware that these parties can be rather high-spirited. Some bars hold cailidhs -- performances of traditional music, song and dance.    Visitors to Scotland can attend Hogmany celebrations in some hotels. For example, in Edinburgh the Caledonian Hotel (Princes Street, Edinburgh, EH1 2AB; 225 2433) has a choice of four dinners, with dancing, ranging from a four-course dinner in the Gazebo restaurant for $131, to a six-course meal, for $191, in the Pompadour restaurant, both with a piper performing at midnight. The Hospitality Inn in Irvine (46 Annick Road, Irvine, Ayrshire KA11 4LD, Scotland; 74272) on the west coast, has a three-night package, $451 a person, including a ball, disco dance, a fancy dress party and a poolside buffet lunch.  Johnstounburn House Hotel (Humbie, near Edinburgh, EH36 5TL; 533696) has a three-night program Dec. 30 until breakfast Jan. 2, which includes a Scottish feast with piping, and a New Year's Day brunch, for $480 a person.  Utah Ski Discounts    Q.     I read that discount ski lift tickets could be bought at supermarkets, gas stations and other places in the Denver area. Are there similar discount lift tickets in the Salt Lake City area? -- Daniel C. Adcock, Washington     A.  There are some discount tickets or vouchers available at retail outlets in the Salt Lake City area. Among them:   Park West (801-649-5400) offers cards that provide a $10 discount on a daily lift ticket, which is regularly $25. The cards -- called Pepsi cards because the soft drink company distributes and has its logo on them -- are available, one to a person, at no charge at 7-Eleven stores and Sizzler restaurants in the Salt Lake City area but not in Park City.   Snowbird (801-742-2222) sells discount tickets at Smith's grocery stores. A ticket good for a day's use of the area's tram and all lifts is $29; the regular price is $35. A pass just for chairlifts is $22 at Smith's; the regular price is $28.    Brighton Ski Resort (801-943-8309) sells vouchers at Gart Brothers sporting good stores in Utah that can be redeemed at the ski area for lift tickets. Vouchers for a full-day pass are $18; the full price is $20. Half-day vouchers are $13; they are $15 at the area. Vouchers for night skiing are $7; they are $8 at full price.   Sundance (201-225-4107) offers Sundance Cards, which cost $10 a person, or $8 a person for families of three or more, provide a $2 discount off the weekday rate of $15, and $3 off the weekend and holiday rate of $22. The cards are available at Herman's and Parks sporting goods stores in Utah or by mailing a check to Sundance Ticket Office, R.R. 3, Box A-1, Sundance Utah 84604.    Deer Valley and Solitude offered books of discount lift tickets, but these were aimed at promoting early sales among residents, and have been discontinued by now. Alta does not offer discounts on its $21 daily lift tickets.   London Computer Rentals    Q.

Q and A"},{"year":"1991","title":"Ainu People of Japan    Q.     How can one visit the Ainu Indians of northern Hokkaido and the Kurile Islands of Japan? -- H. R. Carter, Victoria, British Columbia     A.  The Ainu were the original inhabitants of Hokkaido and adjacent islands, including the Kurile Islands. Over the centuries the Ainu people have mixed with the Japanese, and there are very few full-blooded Ainu people living today. On Hokkaido there are three re-created Ainu villages that teach visitors about Ainu history, crafts and customs. During the day, these villages are inhabited mainly by Ainu, but they do not live there full-time.   The biggest such village is Shiraoi Ainu Kotan (kotan means village) in southern Hokkaido on the shore of Lake Poroto. Once the home of hundreds of Ainu, this village now contains an Ainu museum and re-creations of several thatched, rectangular Ainu houses. There are demonstrations of Ainu song, dance and crafts. The village is open daily, except Dec. 30 to Jan. 4, from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. April to October and 8 A.M. to 6:30 P.M. the rest of the year. Admission is $3.70. Shiraoi is 30 minutes by train from the Noboribetsu hot springs area (an hour and a half from Sapporo, Hokkaido's capital) or 30 minutes by bus from Tomakomai. At the site, the Shiraoi Dosanko Tanabata Matsuri Festival, with Ainu folk dancing, a parade and fireworks, takes place on the second weekend in August.   The Chikabumi Ainu Kotan, in north central Hokkaido, has 70 Ainu houses where 300 people work, and an Ainu cemetery. There is no admission fee. The village is open Tuesday to Saturday from 9:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Sunday from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. It is a 20-minute bus ride from the city of Asahigawa.   In the mountains of eastern Hokkaido near Lake Akan is the Lake Akan Ainu Kotan. The village has a number of shops demonstrating the making of such crafts as carved wooden bears and selling them. There is a 30-minute folk dance demonstration, admission $4.50, at the Ainu Tourist Center several times a day. The village is open daily. A festivalOct. 8 to 10 draws several hundred people of Ainu ancestry. The village is about a two-hour drive from each of the two main cities in eastern Hokkaido, Abashiri and Kushiro.    The Nifudani Ainu Cultural Museum, in the village of Nifudani along the Sarukawa River, is in an area said to be the cradle of Ainu culture, once containing many Ainu villages. The museum, telephone (0451) 2 2892, contains more than 1,000 Ainu tools and artifacts. It is open daily from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., and admission is $2.25.   There was a group of Ainu on the Kurile Islands, but they were removed to Hokkaido when the Japanese were evacuated from the Kuriles after World War II. Butter Chicken in London    Q.     We became aficionados of butter chicken in India. We have been told there are restaurants in London that offer butter chicken but have never found any. Can you help? -- F. E. Wertheimer, New York, N.Y.     A.  Butter chicken, popular in New Delhi, is first cooked in a clay tandoor oven and then cut into pieces and further cooked in tomato puree thickened with cream and butter. The dish is commonly eaten with the hands along with one of several types of Indian bread.   Butter chicken is offered at many of the Indian restaurants in London, but you might not have found it because it generally has other names. Among them are murgh makhani, chicken makhani, chicken tikka makhani or chicken tikka masala.   The following restaurants serve butter chicken:   Bombay Brasserie, Courtfield Close, Courtfield Road, Kensington","excerpt":"telephone (071) 370 4040.

When does it occur next? -- Darlene Kasten, Fanwood, N.J.      A.  The Floriade is a horticultural show that does indeed take place in the Netherlands every 10 years. The next Floriade will take place from April 10 to Oct. 11, 1992, in Zoetermeer, a town near The Hague.   Work is in progress on a 180-acre site, where there will be a number of halls and greenhouses, outdoor display areas, shops, restaurants, old streetcars, boats, a monorail and a 228-foot observation tower.    The Floriade displays will be grouped into seven themes: production, featuring cultivation methods and displaying a variety of bulbs, flowers, trees, plants and vegetables; consumer, with a variety of garden displays; environment, emphasizing water management; the future, emphasizing new breeding techniques and technology; world, with contributions from 20 countries, and recreation, with leisure activities for adults and children.   After the Floriade, the area will be converted to a new borough of Zoetermeer and will contain 9,200 homes by the year 2000.  Jogging in Paris    Q.     Are there safe areas in Paris frequented by joggers? Are there health clubs or gyms one can use for a fee? -- Helen Clay Chace, Mount Kisco, N.Y.     A.  Any of the smaller Parisian parks are safe for jogging during daylight: Parc Monceau (8th arrondissement), Parc Monsouris (14th), the Tuileries (1st), Parc des Buttes-Chaumont (19th) and the Luxembourg Garden (6th). The Bois de Vincennes, off the eastern edge of Paris and the Bois de Boulogne, on the west, are much bigger and largely safe, but during the week they are less frequented by joggers than the others. If you have any concerns, those two parks are much busier on the weekend. The path around the lake in the Bois de Boulogne, is especially popular for jogging then.   As for fitness clubs, the Gymnase Club is the largest organization in Paris, with 10 centers around the city. The central telephone number is 45.74.37.17. A $45 fee allows one to buy 10 tickets for $100, each good for one use of a club and valid for one year.

Suddenly, the rent on the outdoor space was raised to $20 a month. Was this legal? ... C.B., Bronxville, N.Y. Answer: The Westchester County Rent Guidelines Board says you appear to have a legitimate complaint. The rent for any parking spaces reserved for rent-stabilized apartments is regulated by the same guidelines that govern the apartments themselves. As with apartments, these rents cannot be arbitrarily readjusted before the new guideline adjustment date. The current guidelines, which are still in effect because the board has not yet agreed on new ones for the year that began Friday, are 12, 15, and 18 percent for one- , two- and three-year leases, respectively.

The Remix; Cutting Edge"},{"year":"1991","title":"THOUSANDS of Americans go to Nepal every year to enjoy trekking in the spectacular Himalayas and to marvel at the unspoiled medieval townscapes of the Katmandu Valley. But then, more often then not, these travelers pack up and go away without even a taste of Nepali food, a gentle cuisine that has been pushed aside by the Indian, Chinese, Thai and Western dishes that dominate hotel and restaurant menus.    In 1987 Manohar Pandey, a Nepali back from five years of management training in the fast-food chains of California, saw the empty space in Katmandu's expanding restaurant trade, and started looking for the right place to open a Nepali establishment that would be as true to its country's arts and culture as it was to its food.    In a few months he had found six business partners and a deserted, four-story, 90-year-old mansion belonging to an aristocratic Brahmin family who had served a clan of hereditary rulers called the Ranas. In Hindu Nepal, high-caste Brahmins and Chettris are still powerful and prosperous people, and the inheritors of the house had moved on to what they thought was a better life in a modern home.    \\"This old house was in very bad shape when we took over,\\" said Mr. Pandey, who had been a food and beverage manager at Katmandu's Annapurna Hotel before accompanying his wife, Saroj, to California, where she did postgraduate studies in zoology. \\"The Brahmin family had  done very well and nobody wanted to live here anymore.\\"    By March 1989 the restored and remodeled house was ready to begin business as Bhanchha Ghar -- the Nepali Kitchen. Walls had been painted white, old mud floors covered with local brick and the top-floor storeroom turned into a bar. But the Nepali Kitchen had barely opened before it was dealt a blow by a drop in tourism after a punitive Indian embargo on this landlocked kingdom. The next year, political protests emptied the town.    Now, with a newly elected democratic Government in Nepal and the promise of a general liberalization of life in Katmandu, the Nepali Kitchen is alive in the evenings with tourists from all over Europe, the Americas and Asia, as well as local people who kept the restaurant going during its impossibly difficult early years. A new Bhanchha Ghar restaurant will open in Pokhara in west-central Nepal in October and other restaurateurs are reported to be planning similar ventures.    An evening at the Nepali Kitchen -- open every day from noon to about 10 P.M. -- usually begins in the fourth-floor bar, where the environment and decor are completely Nepali.    Guests leave their shoes at the bottom of the wooden staircase and ascend to a large, carpeted room under the eaves furnished with floor pillows, low tables and a huge charcoal brazier for warmth in cool seasons.    The steeply pitched ceilings of the room, which once served as a kitchen as well as storeroom, allowing the cooking odors to rise away from the rest of the old house, are covered with colorful appliqued panels in mandala patterns common to Hindu and Buddhist design.   The Nepali dining experience begins with the bar snacks of peanuts steamed in garlic and spices, dumplings stuffed with spicy minced meat ($1.50), or smoked venison chips, which look like thick potato chips and have a sharp and salty flavor. The bar also offers imported liquors and locally brewed Tuborg and San Miguel beers ($1.50) as well as Nepal's own beer, Iceberg.    Downstairs, diners occupy two floors, with a few tables in each of the mansion's old rooms. In keeping with the setting, the food is also intended to be aristocratic.   \\"The class of food we are reviving here is not ordinary village food, but the high-class food of the Brahmins and the Chettris,\\" Mr. Pandey said as he explained the menu.    \\"We also serve some Newari dishes.\\" The Newari people were once the rulers of the Katmandu Valley and built its extraordinary brick temple towns.    The Nepali Kitchen has an a la carte menu as well as a sort of \\"thali du jour\\" -- the large metal plate heaped with a variety of dishes that is also found in South India. A South Indian thali (pronounced TAH-lee) is distinguished by the red-hot spiciness of the food. The Nepali variety is bland by comparison, with more delicate seasonings.    Two interesting dishes from the a la carte menu are the momocha and chatamari. Momochas are mutton-filled dumplings served at the Nepali Kitchen with a Newari-style tomato-based dip. Mr. Pandey, searching for a way to best describe a chatamari called it a Nepali pizza. It is a pie with a flat, rice-dough base on which a mixture of ground mutton and egg is piled before baking. Each dish costs about $1.30. A la carte dishes include soups, curries, kebabs and marinated and grilled meats (chicken, pork, wild boar, mutton) at prices ranging from $2 to $5.    Meat dishes may be alternately fried, barbecued or curried from day to day. The restaurant uses no beef, which the Hindu religion forbids. In fact, Brahmins are expected to forswear all meats, though vegetarianism is not so widely practiced as it once was in South Asia.    The Nepali thali is usually a nice mix of flavors, and a good choice for a first-time diner, Mr. Pandey said. Servings are generous and refills instant, so diners can select favorites and stick to them.    A thali dinner costs about $8 a person, without drinks.    On a recent evening the thali, a brass plate heated to keep the food from getting cold, was first filled with the traditional mound of rice, the base for the other dishes.    Around the rice were served curries and stews of wild boar, mutton and vegetables.    A dal (or puree) of black lentils is a specialty at the Nepali Kitchen, and is served with almost every meal. So is a buckwheat flatbread resembling a chapati or thick tortilla, and several bowls of pickled vegetables or a pickled shredded chicken salad.    To add another traditional touch, a tiny ceramic bowl of rakshi, a strong rice wine, is served with every meal. Most uninitiated people regard it as lethal. A sip gives tongue-stinging testimony to its power.    The Nepali Kitchen sticks to three dessert specialties, all under a dollar: a mixed fruit compote, a sweet rice pudding and a spiced yogurt dish called shikarnee, a cool end to an evening of curries and barbecues.    Mr. Pandey has not stopped with Nepali food or pillows in the bar. Throughout the restaurant, he has used local pottery, handwoven fabrics and ethnic art.  In the entry foyer at ground level, Mr. Pandey built a small stall where handicrafts like those used in the restaurant can be bought. A gallery for Nepali artists is about to open opposite the handicraft stall.    \\"Wherever we could find Nepali things, we said: 'Let's use them,' \\" he recalls. \\"Let's give these local people a chance.\\"                    . . .

J.S., Bronx Answer: The Conciliation and Appeals Board says the owner may charge whatever he thinks is a fair market rent. However, he must notify the tenant by certified mail within 30 days of his taking occupancy of his 90-day right to petition the board to reduce the rent. If the tenant chooses not to, that rent becomes the legal starting rent for that apartment under rent stabilization.   If the tenant contests the rent level, the C.A.B. investigates the claim, generally by using a formula involving either the maximum rent that could have been charged for the apartment under rent stabilization in 1974-75, when the state law authorizing rent stabilization took effect, or current rents for comparable rentstabilized apartments in the same building.

On Sept. 3 at 11:30 A.M., King Albert II will review a march-past of veterans in the heart of the city, the Grand'Place. A fly-past of British vintage aircraft will follow, and that evening the Welsh Guards, who were the first to reach the city, will parade through the Grand'Place.

We would like to visit places in Switzerland where St. Bernard dogs are bred. Is this possible? -- Regina Parker, New York, N.Y.   A.  The St. Bernard dog was originally developed in the 18th century by monks at the Hospice of the St. Bernard Pass in the Swiss Alps. The dog, a cross of bulldog and Pyrenean shepherd, was bred mainly to guide the monks over snow-covered trails. The hospice, founded in 1049 by St. Bernard of Menthon, is now occupied by Augustinian monks, who continue to breed St. Bernard dogs. The kennels, which have 15 adult dogs along with their puppies, may be visited from mid-June to September. On the grounds is a dormitory with space for 111 people ($11 a person a night) and 40 rooms with four beds in each ($16).  Visitors who are not going to the hospice for religious reasons and want to stay overnight must arrive on foot in the summer or, the rest of the year when the area is snowed over, on cross-country skis.

What United States ski areas offer outdoor ice-skating facilities? Rosemarie Baiocchi, New York, N.Y.   A.  Here are some of the rinks at or near ski areas:    In Maine, Sugarloaf/U.S.A. has an Olympic-size rink, 100 by 200 feet, at the Carrabassett Valley Ski Touring Center, about a mile from the downhill area. The rink is open 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. Sunday to Thursday and 9 A.M. to 10 P.M. Friday, Saturday and holidays. Skating is $3; children, $2. Rental is $2.   In the village of Stowe, Vt., about seven miles from the ski mountain, is a rink, 85 by 200 feet, open weekdays from 10 A.M. to 2:45 P.M.; Saturday from 12:30 to 2:45 P.M. and 8 to 9:30 P.M., and Sunday from 12:30 to 2 P.M. and 8:15 to 9:15 P.M. The cost is $1.50; rental is $3.50.     In Colorado, a pond in the village of Breckenridge at the base of Peak 9 is open for skating from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M. and the cost, including skate rental, is $6; children, $4. At Copper Mountain, West Lake pond in the middle of the village is used as a rink; there is no charge for skating. Skates can be rented at the Turning Point sporting goods shop at the edge of the pond, for $6 an hour.   At Beaver Creek, near Vail, Nottingham Lake is used for skating. Hours are announced monthly; there are generally periods in morning, afternoon and evening. The cost is $4; children, $3. Rental is $2. In Vail, the golf course is flooded and, when frozen over, used for skating daily from noon to 2 P.M. and 4 to 6 P.M. There is no charge; rentals are $3, and for children, $2.   In Utah, a skating rink in the Park City Resort Center, a condominium complex, is open from 11 A.M. to 9 P.M. daily (to 10 P.M. Friday and Saturday), and the cost is $7, $6 for children, which includes skate rental.   At Sun Valley, Idaho, an outdoor rink in front of Sun Valley Lodge is open daily all year, 11 A.M. to 2 P.M., 2:15 to 5 P.M. and 7 to 9:30 P.M. Skating is $5; rental is $2.   At Squaw Valley, Calif., a new Olympic-size rink opened this season above the area's upper cable car terminal. The rink has a spectacular view of Lake Tahoe.

How does one get tickets to the Monaco Grand Prix? -- Rita Hochberg, Great Neck, L.I.     A.  The Monaco Grand Prix takes place May 12 this year, with trials starting May 9. There are grandstands along much of the 2.065-mile course. Reserved seats for the May 12 race range from $90 to $220 for the best seats, which also have a view of a huge video screen, with most in the $150 to $170 range. Standing room is $30 to $50. Order forms can be obtained from the Monaco Government Tourist Office, 845 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022; (212) 759-5227.  Requests, with checks in French francs, plus an additional fee of about $6, are then mailed to Monaco. Tickets are sold at the Automobile Club of Monaco, 23 Boulevard Albert I, or at rail stations in Monaco. However, the tourist office warns that tickets may not be available by the time visitors arrive in Monaco.    Hotel rooms and rootops are good viewing places, but the hotels are generally booked as much as a year or two ahead. The tourist office said that the gulf crisis might prompt some cancellations and that those hoping for last-minute reservations should call the office to check.    One tour package that includes hotel viewing is offered by a company called Expeditions, 9 Mott Avenue, Norwalk, Conn. 06850; (203) 852-0200. The trip, May 5 to 13, includes accommodations at the Loews Monte Carlo, admission to the auto staging areas, and breakfast and dinner daily, for $2,895, with two in a room and not including air fare.    Another tour, on the same dates and also at the Loews with breakfasts and dinners, is offered by Grand Prix Tours, 2482 Newport Boulevard, Suite 3, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92627; (714) 646-0327. The cost is $2,995 a person. Attendance at the black-tie dinner May 12 for the royal family and the drivers is $360. Airport Fee in Tokyo    Q.     I was bumped from a United Airlines flight to Tokyo and missed the connecting flight to Beijing the same day. The airline picked up the tab for my hotel and meals once I got to Tokyo but did not pay the $16 Narita airport fee, which would not have been incurred if had I made the connection. Why should a customer be responsible for this expense? -- N. C. Wiest, Ossining, N.Y.        A.  Travelers changing planes at Narita airport are exempt from the 2,000 yen airport departure fee, but those, like you, who make a stopover for a night or more must pay it. However, when United Airlines travelers are held over because they are bumped from an overbooked flight, the airline's policy is to issue them a form that charges the airline rather than the passenger for the fee.

The chief bookkeeper  was, like herself, a European immigrant who read books and listened to music. Mr. Levinson (an unhappily married man who lived in the Bronx) saw in my mother  (a soulful young woman who lived on the Lower East Side) a kindred spirit. When  they parted at the end of the working day his need for her conversation had often not run its course, and he fell into the habit of writing to her late at night.         These letters were remarkably varied in mood and content. They might begin reflectively at the point where the discussion had ended that day, or announce suddenly that he'd been to the theater and was drenched in longing for he knew not what, or that a child was sick, the apartment in chaos and his life a hell.  The language might be poetic in tone or cynical or despairing: variations of response he allowed himself only in writing, never face to face at the bakery.

A truly menial task, to be sure, but not boring: the letters were written by a young couple whose families would not permit them to see each other, so they continued their romance by writing to each other several times a day, over a period of several years. (Eventually the families relented, and they were married.) Their letters were everyday life and at the same time poetic, full of personality; it's hard to imagine the same spirit in a telephone conversation.  PHILIP RESNIK  Arlington, Mass.
