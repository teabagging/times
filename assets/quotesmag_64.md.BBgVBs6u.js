Gehrig died on June 2, 1941.    1,307  EVERETT SCOTT, Red Sox, Yankees  June 20, 1916-May 5, 1925  Everett Scott is benched by Yankees Manager Miller Huggins, who says he made the substitution of Pee Wee Wanninger because Scott ''was not feeling well.'' Scott is unhappy with the benching. He says: ''It seems funny that it should happen the day after we win and make two hits. Not that I care about the record. When I passed the 1,000 mark, I lost interest in the matter.'' Less than four weeks later, Gehrig begins his streak as a pinch-hitter for Wanninger, the player who ended Scott's streak.    1,207  STEVE GARVEY, Dodgers, Padres  Sept. 3, 1975-July 29, 1983  Injures thumb in the first game of a doubleheader and misses second game.    1,117  BILLY WILLIAMS, Cubs  Sept. 22, 1963-Sept. 2, 1970  Benches himself because he is ''pooped.''

It is natural that the producers should act with prudence. They are on the horns of a dilemma. If they make talkies, there are as yet few cinemas in the country equipped for them. If they make silent films they cannot sell them abroad. The position is curious. In the end, one would say, the vogue of talkies should work out to the advantage of the French industry, since it is able to produce directly for its own public in the French language. It is a makeshift arrangement to have dialogue films in English with a running translation or explanation in French flashed up beside them. But the time for confident action by the producers is not yet. In this country audible pictures are still in their infancy and, except in Paris, the public has had little opportunity of showing its reaction to them.\\"Le Collier de la Reine\\" (\\"The Queen's Necklace\\") is very far from being a hundred per cent talkie, but it has one long and striking scene at the end which represents the whipping of a woman in public, and this is shown with the accompaniments of agonized cries and the shouting and tumult of a crowd, which enormously increase its effect. The musical accompaniment, which is continuous, is also registered throughout, which assures the film of the advantage of a good orchestra. It also guarantees the spiritual appropriateness of the music, which has been chosen with good taste by M. Andre Roubaud. Some of the old dances are exquisite.Based on Fact.M. Gaston Ravel and M. Tony Lekain have made their film out of the astonishing and true story of the $300,000 necklace bought ostensibly for Queen Marie Antoinette, and which ended with an immense court scandal, throwing some doubt, probably unjustified, on the honor of that great and ill-fated lady.M. Ravel wisely starts with the idea of a film and not of a theatre play or a novel. His work is genuine cinema and the action goes with admirable pace and effect. He has done little violence to history, though he has strengthened the love motive beyond the warrant of the facts, a permissible liberty in romance. The film gives an excellent portrait of the strange and romantic Jeanne de Valois, who was an authentic descendant of King Henri II, by way of a love affair of that monarch in 1550. Jeanne, as a little girl, went in the streets of Paris begging alms for \\"an orphan of the blood of the Valois,\\" attracted the attention of a lady of the court and received a pittance as a sort of pension. She was introduced to the Cardinal de Rohan, who is presented in the film as a charming man of the world but a deporable prelate. For years in something like disgrace at court, the Cardinal's chief desire—as represented in the story—is to regain the favor of the Queen. Jeanne, who has married a poor army officer and become Comtesse de la Motte, pretends that she has aroused the pity of Marie Antoinette and is on terms of affection with her royal relative. She has a way with her and completely imposed on the credulity of the Cardinal. She even persuades him to go to a midnight meeting with the Queen in the gardens of Versailles, dressing up a woman friend to play the part of Marie Antoinette for the occasion.The Forged Signature.Soon afterward she tells the Cardinal that the Queen wants to buy a great diamond necklace and wishes him to act as her intermediary in the transaction. The Cardinal signs an agreement to pay the jeweler, the contract bearing also the counter-signature of Marie Antoinette, forged by a lover of Jeanne. The necklace is then handed over to Jeanne for transmission to the Queen. It never reaches her, but goes to pay Jeanne's debts, establish her in a château and give her existence all the splendor of that of a grande dame. As no money comes from the Queen the Cardinal in his turn refuses to pay, and the plot is exposed by the jeweler going directly to the Queen with a letter praying for payment. The King has the Cardinal publicly arrested in the château of Versailles just before mass and, together with Jeanne de la Motte, brought before the judicial court of the Parliament. Jeanne, posing with all the dignity of a Valois, tries to brazen out the affair, denies everything and with supreme audacity attempts to throw suspicion both on the Cardinal and the Queen. The Cardinal is acquitted, but Jeanne is sentenced to be publicly whipped and branded as a thief.In the film the Becky Sharp character of Jeanne comes out admirably in the acting of Marcelle Jefferson-Cohn. There is no audible dialogue throughout the greater part of the film. FIRST FRENCH TALKIE FILMS IN PARIS","excerpt":"Based on Fact.

Think back to the historic days of the German film and you may be able to recall the Ann Boleyn whom Lubitsch chose as protagonist to Jannings' Henry VIII. That was the height of this actress's career, her only plunge into the sea of internationalism. Otherwise she has remained the most Teutonic of the German film stars and, perhaps, just for this reason, for many years the greatest favorite. She started her career back in the days when they were turning out those excruciating shorts which now add merriment to a drooping program. Clad in long, wide flowing robes she bemoaned the loss of her little baby, just taken to heaven by an angel with cardboard wings, or she called loudly on the Fates to avenge her for what the long, sleek, black-whiskered villain had done to her virtue. Later, she developed into an actress and in some of the pictures made around the year 1920, especially Hauptmann's \\"Rose Berndt,\\" she reached tragic depth. I am sure I shall not surprise you at all when I report that she is distinctly buxom of build and that her hair has the shimmer of gold about it.Based on Stage Play.And now Henny has made her first talker. Like Greta Garbo and Gloria Swanson she speaks and even, unfortunately, sings. But her ardent admirers will probably not be annoyed by that and, from their viewpoint, they will be perfectly right, for, Henny Porten is the essence of all that they admire. She is the German middle-class ideal with its solid vitality, with its coquettishness coated with just a trifle too much sugar. Is it any wonder that they storm the box office to view her?The picture in which she is now desporting herself at the Ufa Palast is called \\"Scandal About Eva,\\" founded on a stage play of a like name. Eva is a school teacher who is engaged to a Minister of Education. She discovers that he has an illegitimate child of which he has never informed her and she adopts it without his knowledge. The natural consequence is that she is suspected of being its mother and her fiancé is not too gracious to her about it.The members of the school board are drawn into the matter because she refuses to resign and they are threatened with the exposure of their respective pasts unless she goes. They all have committed some mild moral lapses and are terrified of an attack in the papers. A usable structure on which to hang a comedy but, sadly enough, the director, Papst, whom I had occasion to praise a short time ago for his excellent \\"The Western Front 1918,\\" has taken too ponderous a tempo. After even the shortest scenes there is a lengthy fade-out and the pantomimic slowness of the old silent days continually creeps in.\\"Tenderness\\" is the name of a talker directed by Richard Loewenbein which had its German première at the Universum. The first night audience of this house, which has been kicking up a lot of rucktions lately, showed none of the quality of mercy, let alone tenderness, about its reception of this work. And who can blame them, for it certainly reached bedrock. The scenario, founded on a play by Henri Bataille, is another one of those triangle contraptions. In this day and age it seems almost unbelievable that a French playwright of note can turn out such ware, and it is even more bewildering to realize that any one would produce it.

For this seventeenth century fiction, which creaked into the Criterion Saturday under the title, \\"The Strange Door,\\" is more ludicrous than chilling. \\"That door,\\" says Charles Laughton, smirking balefully, \\"is a nice piece of ingenuity.\\" Mr. Laughton hits the nail right on the head. The ingenuity in this period piece ends right there.Of course, most of the standard gimmicks have been included in this poor man's Gothic tale. The Maletroit manse is chock full of sliding panels, dank dungeons, screams-in-the-night and unbelievably stately dialogue. The resemblance to the original Stevenson short story is not too apparent, however. In this case, the Sire de Maletroit, a slightly daft citizen, has the handsome brawler, Denis de Beaulieu, spirited into his chateau via that \\"strange door\\" and then forces him into marriage with his beauteous niece. Seems it's all being done because de Maletroit has been nursing an unrequited love for and a grudge against the damsel's dead mother while keeping his brother—Mlle. de Maletroit's father—incarcerated in a subterranean gaol these twenty years.As our man is a devilish fiend when he is frustrated, he jugs the young couple in a cell with contracting walls upon learning that they have fallen in love. But this is one \\"cliffhanger\\" that needs no further episodes, as the malevolent Maletroit soon is hoist by his own petard.Perhaps \\"The Strange Door\\" might have been a genuinely suspense-filled film if Maletroit simply were characterized as a nasty man. In Charles Laughton's portrayal, he is merely an oily, petulant and flamboyant nobleman, more farcical than evil. Although he is varsity villain from 'way back, Boris Karloff is more woebegone than menacing as a retainer of Sally Forrest, the pretty and put-upon maiden of this chamber of horrors. Richard Stapley is properly energetic as her romantic vis-a-vis. And, in scoffing at his host by saying \\"I'm not impressed,\\" he speaks the film's most prophetic line.

While no one with a good sense of history will dispute that the slave trade wreaked incalculable havoc on the black race, it is preposterous to blame it for Africa's underdevelopment.   As a Nigerian living in the United States who travels frequently to Africa (I returned from Nigeria on Nov. 21), I have seen more damage done to that continent by incompetent and corrupt leadership than slavery ever did. The African landscape is awash with a class of leadership whose revolutionary songs were about ultimate redemption of the masses. Nevertheless, soon after they establish their rulership, they focus on personal enrichment. When things go wrong and the people start complaining, they resort to blame-the-West syndrome.   Was it the West that supervised the depletion of Nigeria's $100 billion oil fortune, earned between 1970 and 1980? Was it the West that was responsible for diverting much of those earnings to private bank accounts in Switzerland? Perhaps President Babangida should have explained to conference participants why Nigeria's telephone system hardly works?    Or is the West responsible for roads that are never maintained? Or is the West also responsible for the National Electric Power Authority's inability to deliver steady electric services to Nigerian homes?   How could any government that is worth its mettle spend so much time and effort persuading its citizens to learn to live with economic austerity measures only to turn around and sell its crude oil, its single most important source of revenue, at below-market price?   Instead of lavishing our energy on organizing conferences whose sole purpose is cheap self-serving international publicity, our attention should be on the serious problems confronting us.

Holmes is being played by Basil Rathbone, Dr. Watson by Nigel Bruce and the Hound by—but that's the question. For, unless you're up on Conan Doyle, you'll have to discover for yourself whether it's a real mastiff or just a four-legged curse that has been dogging the Baskervilles since Magna Carta.Putting its straightest face upon the matter and being as weird as all get-out, the film succeeds rather well in reproducing Sir Arthur's macabre detective story along forthright cinema lines. The technicians have whipped up a moor at least twice as desolate as any ghost-story moor has need to be, the mist swirls steadily, the savage howl of the Baskerville hound is heard at all the melodramatically appropriate intervals and Mr. Holmes himself, with hunting cap, calabash and omniscience, whispers from time to time, \\"It's murder, Watson, murder!\\"Of course, we had the advantage over Sherlock in having read the book, so we knew all the time how his grim mystery would out. There's just the least reason to believe, too, that most of the others in the audience had their finger on the arch-plotter long before Holmes caught on. But even so, it's fairly good fun and like old times to be seeing Sherlock again and hearing him say, after a nervous twitch of his sensitive nostrils, \\"Watson, the needle!\\" Mr. Rathbone really put something into that line.
