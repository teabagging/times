Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan (PG-13, 98 minutes). A movie featuring Ice Cube bellowing ''No more profanity!'' -- and meaning it -- should produce a lot more laughs than this intermittently amusing sequel does. The film seems to be ''All About the Benjamins,'' to use the title of an Ice Cube action comedy. Most of the decisions involving this sequel to the spirited original ''Barbershop'' are about carefully retracing the steps of that 2002 hit to keep those $100 Benjamins flowing. But although Ice Cube's business sense is right on the money, the minor surprises of the first film are gone. Ice Cube returns as star and executive producer of ''Barbershop 2.'' His Calvin Palmer provides the common sense that holds the shop together, a glue it desperately needs.

For if Anwar el-Sadat's initiative was of crucial importance in opening up an avenue to peace, the way for President Hosni Mubarak to salvage the Camp David accords is not through a policy of appeasement - like Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's in 1938.\\n\\nEgypt, of course, must tread a thin line, acting firmly but not rashly in order not to jeopardize a peace treaty that is already hanging by a thread.\\n\\nBut it would be a mistake for us to confirm a suspicion prominent in some minds that the fear of both Israel's Army reoccupying the Sinai and America's withdrawal of its multimillion dollar aid package has neutralized us and left a clear field for Begin and his military cohorts to wreak havoc in the region. If anyone entertains the view that Egyptians can sit back and savor the fruits of Camp David while their Arab brothers are being slaughtered, they have fallen party to a dangerous illusion. Sooner or later, we may be drawn into the cycle of violence.

The anguished American Jewish community - and indeed the whole world - are asking them today. But with this difference: We have signed a peace treaty with Israel. Inevitably, therefore, when we ask it, somewhere in the background an egotistical worry lurks: ''Why did they do this to us?''"},{"year":"1982","title":"The unwillingness of both Britain and Argentina to reach agreement while the British fleet sails southward is to be expected.

LAST CUP 1990 (lost to Argentina, 1-0, in second round) BEST SHOWING Champion in 1958, 1962 and 1970. FIRST ROUND Russia, June 20 in Stanford, Calif.","excerpt":"Cameroon, June 24 in Stanford; Sweden, June 28 in Pontiac, Mich. COACH Carlos Alberto Parreira, a 51-year-old Brazilian. He never played at the World Cup level, and this is his second tenure as coach. He was the team psychotherapist when Brazil won the World Cup in 1970. Parreira has also coached Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. STYLE Freewheeling and improvising from defense to midfield to attack. Attractive to watch once it gets into a rhythm. TOP PLAYERS Romario, a prolific scorer -- and legendary loudmouth -- who plays in Barcelona; Rai, a midfielder, who plays for Paris St. Germain in France, and Bebeto, a forward, who plays for Deportivo La Coruna in Spain. A reserve forward is Ronaldo, a 17-year-old sensation who works the ball equally well with his left and right foot and who scored 54 goals in Cruzeiro's first 54 games. The front-line duo of Romario and Bebeto symbolizes what Bebeto thinks is Brazil's edge over its opponents. \\"Creativity,\\" he said. \\"We are a group of players capable of deciding a game in an individual play. And the coach will give us that freedom during the cup.\\" The lightning-footed Romario is known for his outspokenness, and his refusal to accept sitting on the bench led to his suspension from the national team last year. Bebeto, a shy, frequently injured homebody, has great ball control around the penalty area and is known for his dangerous free kicks. OUTLOOK One of the favorites in the tournament despite being under pressure for failing since 1970, the year it won the tournament with what is considered the best team in the history of the World Cup. This team has no Pele or Rivelino or Zico or Gerson, but it has a plethora of talented players from defense to attack. They are good enough to restore Brazil's traditional attacking skills. Look for the squad to be one of the most entertaining and colorful teams. Cameroon CUP APPEARANCES Two (1982, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (lost to England, 3-2, in quarterfinals) BEST SHOWING Quarterfinals in 1990. FIRST ROUND Sweden, June 19 in Pasadena, Calif.; Brazil, June 24 in Stanford, Calif., and Russia, June 28 in Stanford. COACH Henri Michel, a likable Frenchman, in January became the fifth man to coach Cameroon since its heartwarming performance in Italy in 1990. Michel is no stranger to the Rose Bowl, where Cameroon will open against Sweden. It was there that the French team coached by Michel won the gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. Later, as coach of the national team, he led France to a third-place finish in the 1986 World Cup. STYLE They used a 4-4-2 four years ago and throughout qualifying, but Michel is leaning toward a 4-3-3 here. The system suits his open demeanor and the Indomitable Lions' surplus of talented strikers. Michel will probably let Francois Omam-Biyick, no longer a true center-forward, operate behind the front three. TOP PLAYERS Cameroon's best player is probably its angular forward Omam-Biyick, who has scored many important goals in nine years with the Lions. Their best-known player is Roger Milla, the 42-year-old striker who came out of retirement four years ago and scored four goals to lead Cameroon into the quarterfinals. Against the wishes of Michel and Omam-Biyick (but with the full support of the Cameroonian public), Milla has come out of retirement again. It remains to be seen whether Michel will play him, particularly since the Lions have no shortage of faster running mates for Omam-Biyik, including the explosive 23-year-old forward Alphonse Tchami. OUTLOOK Political infighting, poor management and financial difficulties turned the team's preparation into a farce. Michel got punched in the face by Jean-Claude Pagal after he learned he was not chosen for the team. With an unsettled mix of aging stars and inexperienced youngsters, and with a nasty group that includes Brazil, Sweden and Russia, the Indomitable Lions look incapable of making the second round. Russia CUP APPEARANCES Seven as the Soviet Union (1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1982, 1986, 1990). LAST CUP 1990 (1-2). BEST SHOWING Semifinals in 1966 FIRST ROUND Brazil, June 20 in Stanford, Calif.; Sweden, June 24 in Pontiac, Mich., and Cameroon, June 28 in Stanford. COACH Pavel Sadyrin, a 51-year-old Russian who took over the team after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, was successful player and coach at the club level. But late last year, 14 of his players called him \\"incompetent\\" and refused to play in the World Cup if he remained coach. The Russian federation backed Sadyrin and gave the players an ultimatum. The mutiny was not the first by a team coached by Sadyrin: he was dismissed at Zenit Leningrad after a player rebellion there in spite of winning a league title. STYLE Orthodox European style. They take a direct route from defense to attack primarily through the flanks with minimal lateral movement. TOP PLAYERS Sergei Yuran, a 24-year-old forward with Benfica of Portugal, is one of the finest prospects in the world and has scored seven internaional goals. Dmitry Kharine, a goalkeeper who plays for Chelsea in England was in goal for the gold-medal winning Soviet team in 1988. Dmitry Radchenko, a forward, who plays for Racing in Spain.  OUTLOOK This is country that has gone through perhaps more team adversity than any other in the tournament. It would be difficult to restore harmony after the coach went as far as calling the rebelling players traitors. Sadyrin doesn't have the service of four key players: winger Andrei Kanchelskis of Manchester United, forward Sergei Kiryakov of Karlsruhe in Germany, forward Igor Kolyvanov of Foggia in Italy and forward Igor Shalimov of Internazionale of Milan in Italy. This is a team that still has good individual players, but they lack cohesion, preparation because of the revolt and are in a difficult group. Don't look for them to get past the first round. Sweden CUP APPEARANCES Eight (1934, 1938, 1950, 1958, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (0-3) BEST SHOWING Runner-up to Brazil in 1958 FIRST ROUND Cameroon, June 19 in Pasadena, Calif.; Russia, June 24 in Pontiac, Mich., and Brazil, June 28 in Pontiac. COACH Tommy Svensson, a 49-year-old Swede, who played for the national team 39 times, including the World Cup tournament in Mexico in 1970. He had coached four Swedish clubs and was coaching in Norway when he was asked to restore Swedish honor after the team finished 21st in Italy in 1990. STYLE Closer to the so-called English School that calls for long passes down the flank and crosses into the middle of the attack. TOP PLAYERS Tomas Brolin, who plays for Parma in the Italian League, has had a stormy relationship with the Swedish team and news media, and actually told Svensson he didn't want to play for his country. But he came back and scored three goals in the 5-0 victory in the qualifying game against Israel. Martin Dahlin, a forward with Borussia Monchengladbach of Germany, was Sweden's leading scorer during qualifying, with eight goals in the nine games. Another key player is Tomas Ravelli of Gothenburg, the 34-year-old goalkeeper. Klas Ingesson, a midfielder, injured his neck in a car crash earlier this month but is expected to be all right by the time the tournament starts. OUTLOOK Another team hampered by the fact that most players compete for clubs outside the country and don't play enough together. Lack of cohesiveness may be evident as a result. The presence of Brolin and Dahlin makes the Swedes dangerous offensively, and advancement past the first round is not farfetched.
