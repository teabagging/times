It tracks the notion of mediumistic writing or writing in tongues through the work of eight 20th- and 21st-century mostly American self-taught artists and one spectacular Burmese yantra (prayer) book from around 1900. It suggests that legibility is only part of the power of language","excerpt":"touch and emotional urgency can push letter-like marks to the brink of meaning and reveal an artist's personal cosmos, especially when fused with a strong sense of imagery and form. Sometimes the language here is simply not the one most viewers speak, as in the yantra book where striped mythic beasts, rotund monsters and splendidly attired guardians are encircled in palindromic prayers. But often it is fabricated and fragmentary. Minnie Evans (American, 1892-1987) enlivened ornate blocks of foliate motifs with similarly intense faces and swarms of tiny inchoate letters. Darcilio Lima (Brazilian, 1944-1991) drew exquisite hybrid creatures worthy of Gustave Moreau that seem guided by delicate numbered diagrams. Numbers prevail in the mathematical constellations of Melvin Way's small, dark yet somehow immense illuminated drawing. Symbols both ancient and scientific rule a large scribbled grid, above, by William Fields (American, born 1940); a photograph of the artist as a well-groomed young man turns into a professorial portrait (although the grid, with its capelike flutter and regal head, has a life of its own). The gyrating symbols that Leroy Person (American, 1907-1985) rendered in choppy crayon have the effect of repeated incantations. So do the chunks of writing competing for space in an overpopulated drawing by Carlo Zinelli (Italian, 1916-1974). Like Zinelli, Harald Stoffers (German, born 1961) is institutionalized; his lines of blocky cursive, all written to his mother, have the tensility of bent wire and accumulate in tight layers, like sediment, or a wayward musical score. The spidery visionary automatism of J.B. Murry (American, 1908-88) brings the show full circle, back to the vicinity of prayers.

GOING OUT Guide"},{"year":"1990","title":"INTERNATIONAL After 15 Years, Washington Looks to Moscow's Hunger  The question is, will Western aid for the Soviet Union furnish a down payment on economic progress, or a drunken, delirious banquet likely to end in deeper despair? Russian citizens and American scholars wonder. President Bush last week approved $1 billion in Federal credits for the Soviet Union, lifting a 15-year ban on such aid with the goal of easing Soviet food shortages. The United States rejected European calls for full Soviet membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, saying the Soviets should receive only Special Association status pending further economic reforms. Many Soviets feel the kindest deed they can do for foreigners bringing money and supplies is to warn that their fellow Russians are cheats, profiteers and thieves. Using the K.G.B. to police food distribution is hardly reassuring. The K.G.B. officer trying to sell his high-crested hat to tourists one day is unlikely to to keep his hands off Western goodies the next. Dyed-in-the-Wood Gorbachev  Under the skin, deep inside, is Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev really another Brezhnev? A Khrushchev? A Stalin, or Lenin, perhaps? Moscow souvenir-hunters can count up the implications of the nesting wooden dolls of Soviet leaders sold along the Arbat, the pedestrian mall. They are a 1990's version of the traditional    matrushka    dolls, which, in Brezhnev's and Stalin's times, invariably depicted maidens, soldiers and other politically safe subjects. The doll vendors are evidently taking advantage of Mr. Gorbachev's encouragement of free markets, hawking Gorby dolls for $20 (hundreds of rubles).   Mexico's Telephone Sale For many Mexicans, a long-distance or international call means a trip to the Telmex office, an hour's wait and charges equal to a day's salary. Last week, the Mexican Government said it would sell Telefonos de Mexico for $1.76 billion to a group that has agreed to bring a donkey-and-cart system into the airline era. The sale, to Grupo Carso of Mexico, the Southwestern Bell Corporation and France Telecom is the latest sign of the country's willingness to accept American investment, according to Sidney Weintraub, a professor at the University of Texas Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. He added that the United States is meanwhile becoming more hesitant about the free flow of goods and money across its southern border. \\"I find that role-reversal ironic,\\" he said.  Post-Hammer Occidental  Maybe Armand Hammer kept going for all those years partly to frustrate the traders who always bid up Occidental Petroleum on rumors of his demise. He died on Monday at the age of 92, the day before his planned bar mitzvah. The stock jumped 1 7/8 to 22 5/8 on Tuesday. Dr. Hammer was long the Soviet Union's favorite capitalist","excerpt":"tour guides at the Lenin Museum in Moscow point out the small statue, a gift from Dr. Hammer, that still sits on Lenin's desk. At Occidental, Dr. Hammer ran his own command economy, purging top aides and spending company funds on an art museum to house his collection, no matter what other stockholders said. Analysts expect Dr. Hammer's patient successor, Ray R. Irani, to introduce perestroika, possibly selling the company's 51 percent interest in IBP Inc., a major meat packer, as well as coal and natural gas operations, to concentrate on chemicals and oil. In Brief  Eastern Airlines might still be falsifying its maintenance records, according to a court document released last week. Eastern and several employees were indicted by a Federal grand jury in July on charges of falsely recording repairs.  The strong German mark, it would seem, buys more in the United States. The largest German utility, RWE A.G., agreed on Thursday to pay $590 million for the Vista Chemical Company. The offer, $55 a share, was more than double the previous day's closing price of $25.    THE ECONOMY   Spreading Recession  The worst monthly decline in industrial production since 1982 confirmed the views of many economists that the current recession is unlikely to be mild. Output fell 1.7 percent last month, with automobile production especally weak. \\"Almost every sector is declining now,\\" said Lawrence Krohn, an economist at Shearson Lehman. He expects production declines to moderate but continue for several months. Not to worry about November's five-tenths of 1 percent rise in producer prices, he added. \\"Anyone who looks for an acceleration of inflation given this depressed environment will be mistaken,\\" he said. New England Bailout  The Bush Administration placed more than $1 billion in Treasury deposits in the ailing Bank of New England this year just as worried depositors were withdrawing billions. Treasury officials denied that the bank had receieved special aid. But the Senate Banking Committee and the General Accounting Office have opened their own inquiries. Retail sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent in November -- no surprise to the store managers who are resorting to pre-Christmas sales. COMPANIES   CBS Dumps the Cash  The implosion of CBS Inc. continues. It was a premier television network with record and magazine businesses besides; then, a network with a huge pile of cash; soon, just a network with lagging profits and a smaller pile of cash. CBS offered on Thursday to buy back about 44 percent of its stock for $190 a share, using about two-thirds of its $3 billion in cash. The immediate cause was the need for the heirs of William S. Paley, the company's founder, to pay estate taxes. But some analysts said the company's president, Laurence A. Tisch, could find no better use for the cash. Or maybe, some said, Larry the Liquidator wants to trim the company down so it can be acquired in one easily digested bite. Mr. Tisch was greeted as a white knight when he invested in CBS in 1986. Now, some there question his colors. Equitable Passes the Hat  That man in front of a midtown Manhattan skyscraper ringing a bell and seeking contributions might be from the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. The needy insurance company announced last week that it plans to raise about $500 million by offering stock to the public. Like most other major life insurers, Equitable has been a mutual company, owned by its policyholders. Losses on \\"junk bonds\\" and real estate have forced the company to raise capital. Analysts expect other impoverished insurers to follow Equitable's examples. Power Over Cable?  Communities would have more power to limit the cost of cable television service under new rules the Federal Communications Commission proposed last week. The measures could be enacted as early as the spring. An Animated Separation  Call off the caterers. Cancel the hall. Mickey Mouse and Miss Piggie have broken off their engagement because their families just can't get along. The Walt Disney Company said on Thursday that it has abandoned its planned acquisition of Henson Associates Inc. and its Muppets. After Jim Henson, the Muppets' creator, died in May, some industry executives say, his five children became rather piggy themselves, refusing to reduce their $100 million-plus asking price. Disney maintained that buying Henson Associates without Henson was like buying Kermit the Tadpole. Kerkorian Targets Chrysler  With the Chrysler Corporation smelling like carrion in the desert, sooner or later a vulture was bound to appear. On Friday, Kirk Kerkorian, the takeover artist who rules his own arid kingdom of Las Vegas casinos and hotels, emerged as the owner of 9.8 percent of Chrysler's shares, which cost him $277 million. The Chrysler board did its best on Friday to make the company unappetizing, offering to sell new shares at less than market value if anyone acquires more than 10 percent of its stock. Some analysts say Chrysler is so weak that, to avoid falling prey to an enemy, it needs to sell out to a wealthy, protective friend. NCR Spurns A.T.&T.  NCR and A.T.& T. are taking their public battle to the stockholders. The NCR Corporation board unanimously rejected a $90-a-share buyout offer last week from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. NCR chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. plans to visit major institutional investors so as to urge them to keep their stock out of A.T.& T.'s hands. The telephone company, for its part, has threatened a proxy fight against the NCR board.

The nonprofit educational group, known until last July as the Prospect Park Environmental Center, is planning the event as part of a series of tours and lectures about Brooklyn. Leading the bus tour will be William Menking, a professor of architecture at the Pratt Institute, who will describe several types of housing, ranging from ornate, 19th-century brownstones to rehabiliated buildings for the poor. Among the first stops will be the 113-year-old Alfred Treadway White Houses in Cobble Hill, which was one of the nation's first housing projects, and the Brooklyn Heights historic district. Other stops will include renovated low-income housing in Williamsburg and Greenpoint and a former school converted to artists' studios in Prospect Heights.    The tour is scheduled from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and will leave from the arch at Grand Army Plaza, just north of Prospect Park. The cost is $25 ($20 for those over age 65) and reservations are required.

It exposes the foul countenance of their city's wayward soul. Dorian banished his festering portrait to the attic. We keep ours in the basement. Over the years, ravages intermittently suppressed at street level have settled below ground in a dense sediment of urban pathologies: poverty, insanity, anger and crime. It is not a pretty picture.   Still, a ridership of 3.5 million daily descends to this underground gallery of fear, undeterred by visions of scurrying rats, defaced walls, hollow-eyed vagrants and platforms perilously overcrowded or frighteningly vacant. And, in fact, the subterranean picture has brightened considerably in recent years. Remarkably, at a time of national drift away from public amenity toward increased privatization, the subway has been shuttling valiantly in the opposite direction. In the past decade, supported by two five-year programs authorized by the New York State Legislature, the Transit Authority has carried out extensive overhauls of the aging subway system. New cars and tracks. A fully air-conditioned, graffiti-free fleet. Renovated stations.  Beefed-up security. New automated turnstiles (looking something like an airport metal detector crossed with a casino slot machine) that will soon accept plastic fare cards. There's even a running campaign of radio ads intended to lure New Yorkers back to the depths.
