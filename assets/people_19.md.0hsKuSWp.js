The comedy is largely in the hands of Ernest Thesiger, who as the Chamberlain elicits chuckles, particularly when he reveals that his strings of medals ring like bells.There are many original touches, and the lovely gowns and uniforms enhance the quality of the production.Miss Christians appears as the Empress Eugenie and Miss Harvey plays the Empress' maid, Juliette. M. Boyer acts the Duke of Pontignac, who attributes his speedy recovery from injuries sustained in a fall from his horse to nothing more nor less than the singing of a song by a female. Who she is, he does not know. For some time he thinks that the Empress is the woman he seeks, because he hears the song rendered from her apartment, but, of course, the audience knows that Juliette is the singer.Out of this frail fable the producers have made a refreshing screen work, with agreeable musical compositions supplied by Franz Wachsmann.

There is little more painful or less inspiring of song than watching as someone you love is cut off from life by illness. But the curious thing about \\"Wings,\\" an 80-minute musical adaptation of Arthur Kopit's 1978 play, is how faintly it evokes the devastating emotions of the experience. I arrived at the New York Shakespeare Festival, where this production has been imported from the Goodman Theater in Chicago, with a pocketful of Kleenex. It was at once a relief and a disappointment to discover that its occasional and ineffectual stabs at sentimentality notwithstanding, \\"Wings\\" is more concerned with the mind than the heart.    Indeed, that is literally the case: like the Kopit play, to which it is largely faithful, this quasi opera is obsessed with the collapse of brain functions that is known as aphasia. In the opening scene, the elderly heroine, Emily (Linda Stephens), an aviator who long ago was an air-show wing walker, has her stroke, and the audience is immediately transported into a mind in which memories are obliterated, language is garbled, logic is short-circuited. Some of that voyage is accomplished visually, by shattered images projected on sliding screens, and some of it by the evocative Sensurround-style sonic effects created by Richard Woodbury. Most impressive, however, is Jeffrey Lunden's score, which uses the scrambling of a consciousness as a cue for musical experimentation.

There was, apart from this, no dramatic musical structure, no attempt to create anticipation or suspense or a sense of musical narrative. There were shifts in mood, perhaps, in a narrow range from the homey to the slightly homesick, but it would have been silly to apply one's conscious mind to keeping track of melodic or harmonic transformations.

Dialogue in Arabic."},{"year":"1945","title":"Early last year Paramount introduced chiller devotees to a classy congress of spirits in \\"The Uninvited,\\" a spooks-and-shivers item directed by Lewis Allen and featuring Gail Russell. Knowing a good thing, the studio, avoiding ghosts and employing the same director and principal, has fashioned in \\"The Unseen,\\" which came to the Globe on Saturday, as tenebrous a tale as has come along in some time. For this terrorfilled saga of sudden death surrounding a young governess in a genteel New England household is superior mystery fare, which is genuinely gripping and generally devoid of the clutch of cliches to which such offerings are heir.Credit, no doubt, is due Ravmond Chandler, Hagar Wilde and Ken Englund, no newcomers to this field, who have adapted the Ethel Lina White novel to the screen. They, as well as the director, have told their story subtly and by indirection. From the opening sequence when an aged domestic is murdered in a gloomy alley on a wild, rainy night, the picture progresses with mounting tension. When Gail Russell comes to fashionable 10 Crescent Drive to take charge of Joel McCrea's two motherless children, she finds them spoiled, unmanageable and strangely cognizant of the weird goings on in the empty, shuttered house next door. It is mainly through them and their curt, irascible and suspect father that this taut tale is unfolded. If the dénouement is somewhat nebulous and none too surprising, the eerie events leading up to the solution should be a treat for thrill-hungry audiences.Richard Lyon (son of Bebe Daniels and Ben Lyon), carries off the acting honors in this frightened family. He is superb as the sullen, tergiversant little boy who unwittingly consorts with the murderer. A close runner-up is Nona Griffith, an elfin and unassuming moppet, who appealingly portrays his sister and ingenuous aide. Gail Russell is, perhaps, miscast as the children's guardian. As the nervous juvenile mistress of the mansion, her delineation lacks conviction. Joel McCrea is properly harsh as the distraught father, while Herbert Marshall gives a commendable performance as the family's friend and physician. But despite its flabby finish and some uncertain histrionics, \\"The Unseen\\" is an excellent sop for seekers of screen suspense.

The sleuth stepped cautiously through a window, puffed on his big cigar, gazed around him and seemed to be prepared for anything. A title insulted this detective, for it set forth that he wouldn't know his own reflection in a mirror.There are a number of episodes in this film that are reminiscent of David W. Griffith's picture, \\"One Exciting Night.\\" There is a man in a hooded mask, a number of pecullar traps, two negroes, one razor, and a will.During the death scene of an elderly man, the villain, impersonated by Philo McCullough, endeavors to put an end to this victim before he has a chance to change the will. The rascal evidently succeeds, and it is eventually a question as to how Stewart (Mr. McCullough) shall be forced to confess. Dr. Naylor sees to it that Stewart is duly startled out of his wits and admits all the details of his crime.This is accomplished by having the dead man apparently come to life. He looks like the real individual, but after his whiskers and mustache have been pulled off, the familiar countenance of dear old Dr. Naylor is disclosed.Notwithstanding the ancient stuff, \\"Easy Pickings\\" is an agreeable surprise.

In their first assignment, Pedro and his best friend, Anibal Guerrero (Bruno Bichir), are sent to patrol a desolate highway in Durango. Pedro quickly discovers that his job is not at all the equivalent of being a modern-day road warrior. Most of the people he stops for petty violations are too poor to afford the licenses required to transport their goods legally. One woman he stops, Griselda (Zaide Silvia Gutierrez), invites him home for breakfast and makes a heated play for him. Weeks later they are married.

With a fine cast and good production and an honest regard for the source, Director Lampin has not been able to rouse a drama from an intellectual dream.The details of the story are plainly put forth","excerpt":"a naive young Russian returns home to the toils of St. Petersburg society after a time in a mental institution; he endeavors to save a rash young woman from the perils of her wanton life and, at the same time, promises marriage to another and innocent girl; this naïvetè makes for jealousy, the scarlet woman is murdered at a lover's vengeful hands and the young prince, dumfounded at this violence, is finally unhinged.For those who are fairly familiar with Dostoyevskian philosophy (and with the twists of French language which are modestly tranlated here), it is possible to draw some vague conceptions of tortured and maddened minds from the restless and agonized actions of the characters in this film. For Gerard Philippe, a sensational new young actor, is strangely luminous and volatile as the prince and Edwige Feuillere is both beautiful and darkly passionate as the woman of tempestuous moods. Nathalie Nattier makes a testy little innocent, with Lucien Coedel a man of raging hates and a cast of several fine actors doing nicely in other roles.But the story, full of foggy spaces and deep psychological dumps, seems to get no further than the implication that moral rearmament in Russia didn't work.

From now on, it's official. On Jan. 25,Mint Director Donna K. Pope announced that her agency had scrapped the old designation as the ''Bureau of the Mint'' and substituted ''United States Mint.'' ''I felt that the term 'bureau' was a confusing one to the public,'' Mrs. Pope explained. ''It did not clearly identify us as the historic Mint of the United States. Additionally, the 'bureau' designation conjures up too many negative images of the stereotyped bureaucrat, images which do not fit our aggressive marketing programs.'' Various private mints have sprung up in the last two decades. The Franklin Mint has become widely known among large segments of American society. To some extent, private mints have tended to blur distinction from the government mint. By simplifying its name, the United States Mint presumably hopes to underscore the difference. The legislation establishing the national mint, in 1792, referred to it simply as ''the Mint.'' Subsequent legislation, beginning the following year, expanded this name to ''Mint of the United States.'' With passage of the wide-ranging Coinage Act of 1873, it formally became a bureau of the Department of the Treasury. According to Mrs. Pope, the latest name change was approved by Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan. In prior years, she noted, the U.S. Customs Service and the Internal Revenue Service both had discontinued use of the word ''bureau'' as part of their formal names.

Mr. Blumenthal, who was researching an article about undercover work, had met the detective a few years earlier while writing a book about a drug case. Now, over a meal at a Flushing, Queens, restaurant, Mr. DeGregorio described the tense life of an undercover cop. In the process, he mentioned his teen-age daughter, then in a drug treatment program. Mr. Blumenthal was immediately intrigued. Here was a police officer who was devoted to exposing drug traffickers and whose own daughter had become involved with drugs. What's more, Mr. DeGregorio had caught her selling them. Mr. Blumenthal quickly lost interest in his article about undercover work.

But instead of narrating the story of the buildings' creation and walking through them with the camera, as a visitor would see them, Mr. Teshigahara tries to evoke the power and mystery of Gaudi's unusual structures simply by letting them speak for themselves. The camera remains mostly stationary - many views could be still photographs - and a few one-line titles explain certain facts.

Dave Grossman, a former Army psychologist and professor at West Point, has never killed in battle. But he has interviewed many men who have, and he has examined the writings of others who have studied the grim psychology of the authorized taking of human life. His research has resulted in \\"On Killing,\\" a book that is both disturbing and oddly reassuring in its description of the torment that accompanies the act by which one person deprives another of life itself.\\n\\nMr. Grossman's book is not a stylistic masterpiece. It is marred by repetitiveness and frequent recourse to the wooden jargon of behaviorist psychology. It also has some material that is not for the squeamish.  Nonetheless, it is a valuable contribution, full of arresting observations and insights of the sort that make you alter the way you have thought about certain subjects, most notably the nature of battle and the dramatic rise in the murder rate that has taken place in the United States in the last two decades.

Upon the outbreak of World War I, they expelled him. By war's end, the British controlled the region and the climate for Jews took a marked turn for the better. In the Balfour Declaration of 1917, the British Government promised the Jews a ''national home'' in Palestine.

A. Mann Brand\\" (\\"Storm Trooper Brand\\"). It is being shown at the Yorkville Theatre and its \\"plot\\" is so simple that even persons understanding no German have no difficulty in following the adventures of the young truck driver (Herr Klingenberg), who is supposed to epitomize in his likable person the hopeful, fighting spirit of the millions of young Germans rallied to the standard of Adolf Hitler.In contradistinction to the later Nazi picture \\"Hans Westmar,\\" which had its first public showing in December, \\"S. A. Mann Brand,\\" dated June, 1933, has no anti-Semitic bias, but concentrates its animus upon the German Communists and their Moscow guides. Just as the earlier Soviet Russian motion pictures painted their enemies all black, so this Nazi effort represents the Reds as the vilest of the vile. Even the Communist girl (Vera Liessem), who is in love with the hero and who helps him double-cross the \\"Moscow agent\\" (Max Weydner) is treated none too gently by the director, although in the end, after the Hitler victory at the polls on March 5, 1933, the spectators may guess that she has been converted to the \\"true faith.\\"Perhaps because the \\"coordination\\" and \\"liquidation\\" of the anti-Nazi elements in Germany had not been completed when this film was turned out, the Social Democratic father (Otto Wernicke) of Brand is depicted as not such a bad type, although deluded by Marxism, and he, too, finally votes for Hitler. Naturally, the \\"Soviet agent\\" is placed under arrest and the audience may imagine what is going to happen to him.From the technical standpoint \\"S. A. Mann Brand\\" is one of the best pictures made in Germany. Although most of the actors are unknown to frequenters of German cinema houses here, their work is uniformly excellent. Many of the scenes are really thrilling.

ALLIES COME TO GRIPS WITH REICH PROPAGANDA","excerpt":"A NAZI TAUNT AT THE ALLIES"},{"year":"1937","title":"LAST Summer Tobis started a film script competition for young writers with a view to screening the best work submitted. The prize fell to two new writers, Walter Forster and Heinz Bierkowsky, for their joint entry \\"Togger,\\" a newspaper film, and the finished product has just been served up to the public.Scrutinized closely the picture reveals gaps, halts, inconsistencies that strain the imagination of the viewer. Besides, it is manifestly a picture of stark propagandistic flavor. But strangely enough, just like this year's UFA film \\"Verraeter,\\" to which it is congenial in Nazi doctrinary persuasions, \\"Togger\\" proves in part a tense bit of entertainment.Togger, editor in chief of \\"Der Neue Tag,\\" leading Berlin daily, starts a campaign against the Reuler group, a foreign concern which is systematically and ruthlessly buying its way in to control German industry. Loss of the remunerative Reuler advertising contract, a barely averted strike by the workers of the publishing house, dissension among Togger's colleagues, are some of its results.To get control of the paper and stop the attacks, a Reuler dummy sells to Breitenbach worthless shares of a paper plant, taking his newspaper shares in exchange as security. The plant burns down, Breitenbach is ruined and shoots himself, the paper shifts into Reuler's hands. Under the new régime Togger is forced to resign. To his provincial paper Peter Geiss attempts to carry on Togger's fight, but it falls flat. State, administration, the public are in a torpor until the 30th of January, 1933, when Hitler comes into power, and in the ensuing cleaning up by the Nazis the alien Reuler group is also swept out. Togger is reinstated, Peter and Hanna marry.Juergen von Alten, mainly known as a director of shorts, has commendably acquitted himself with this full-length film. That from the 30th day of January on the picture loses direction and deportment lies in the nature of the period screened. Mathias Wieman as Peter gives the best performance of his vacillating screen career. He has humor, speed in perception and a dry charm. The Togger of Paul Hartmann is forceful and concentrated, also a decided improvement on previous parts except for one ranting scene, Hartmann relapsing into the classic stage hero, which repellently attacks the membrane of the microphone and the ear. Though attractive to the eyes Renate Mueller as Hanna speaks as if she were lock-jawed. The rest of the numerous cast give excellent background.Reality was added by taking all newspaper shots at the Ullsteinhaus, Germany's biggest publishing firm. But the staged burning of a complete building was a fizzle both from the directing and photographic angle. Newsreels would have supplied much more effective material. For once we might have been spared the derogatory night life scene of the \\"debauched\\" period before the coming of the Third Reich. Yet in spite of its many shortcomings, this picture is one of the best the Fatherland has turned out this season.Perhaps it was the undisputably extraordinary success of Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina\\" with Greta Garbo that induced UFA to a remake of the silent film \\"Kreutzer Sonata\\" by the same author. But what a world of difference in interpretation and execution there is between the American and Teutonic pictures!In an effort to bring this conflict close to modern conscience, turning a psychoanalytical searchlight on its figurative lambrequins and antimacassars, the inherent human conflict became a mere misunderstanding and dissolved into surface theatricalism. The circumstances that so fatefully incriminate the wife and arouse the husband's mad jealousy, which prompts him to kill her, are so honeycombed that they would not convince an adolescent. Besides, this frenetic jealousy rings false, for, being pathological, it does not fit the wholesome character of the husband. These are not flaws of the original story but of its film treatment, which was done by Eva Leidmann, one of Germany's success writers.That some sort of a standard is attained is mainly due to the acting of Peter Petersen. As the husband, Andrej Posdnyshew, he contrasts sensitiveness with brutality, ease with intensity. And the glint of jealous insanity in his eye gives way to an expression of boyish bewilderment. A poignant study. Lil Dagover lends her exotic beauty to the impassive wife, while Albrecht Schoenhals as the troublous element appears quite unruffled by his disastrous effect.Whatever direction is discernible in this screened theatre was done by Veit Harlan. But he must have been altogether absent in the shots where Schoenhals and Lil Dagover played Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata. For not by the greatest stretch of imagination could their mute playing be brought to connect up with the dubbing. And this in the land of regimenting!

Porter's comic stew of wisecracking Americans and vague Britons ran for 248 performances in New York, closing presumably because people stopped wanting to see it.   There is something both sad and invigorating about this adherence to supply and demand. For in order to understand the show's irresistible energy, one must first examine its need to succeed. \\"Gay Divorce\\" bursts with the desire to sell tickets and make audiences happy.

This present edition is an impressive example of the strides made in a decade in motion picture technique, and it can boast also of performances that outshine any of those in the old mute work.Yesterday afternoon the audience may have tittered a little at the sight of the grown-up ignoble son, Isaac, but they applauded John heartily when he dragged Isaac along the high road.James Dunn, who distinguished himself in the leading rôle of the film, \\"Bad Girl,\\" and Mae Marsh, who will be best remembered for her acting in D. W. Griffith's \\"The Birth of a Nation,\\" delivered the outstanding portrayals. Miss Marsh is extraordinarily competent as Mrs. Shelby, the industrious mother, who is first beheld as a relatively young woman and subsequently as the gray-haired mother who is compelled to go to the poor house because Isaac has appropriated all the money sent to her by John while the latter was away in Alaska.Miss Marsh is always natural, and in spite of the nature of this story, which is a modernized conception of Will Carleton's poems, \\"Over the Hill to the Poor House\\" and \\"Over the Hill From the Poor House,\\" her characterization is really lifelike. In joy or woe, her acting is compelling and always subdued. She reveals the industry of the young mother and her pathetic plight as an aged and stooped old woman.Likewise, Mr. Dunn rises to the occasion in his rôle. His is an earnest and thoroughly sympathetic impersonation. This John shoulders the blame for his father's sole bootlegging adventure and serves two years in prison. It is because of this disgrace that he is impelled to join an Alaska expedition.In the opening chapters the Shelby children are played by capable youngsters. Later on Sally Eilers officiates as Isabel Potter, with whom John is in love. Miss Eilers, who was also in \\"Bad Girl,\\" gives an easy and pleasing interpretation of her part. In the end she and John find themselves \\"sitting on top of the world.\\"Isaac, a sanctimonious thief, is played by Olin Howland, who is handicapped by too much of the Scriptures in his lines. Before investigating the contents of one of the letters from John to his mother, he mumbles, \\"Get thee behind me, Satan,\\" but nevertheless he opens the envelope and he quickly pockets the check or money order. Another actor who draws attention to himself here is William Pawley, who marries Susan Shelby. Then there is James Kirkwood, who does capable work as the father.There are some really beautiful glimpses in the course of this production and they are imaginatively photographed.On the stage is a beguiling series of scenes called \\"The Elements,\\" with Patricia Bowman, the Roxyettes and others.

In recent years, however, a market segmentation technique, geodemography, has been developed that appears to combine many of the others' advantages. It is based on census data, reels of information about the 256,000 census ''block groups,'' or neighborhoods, in the United States.

But Picasso's four children suffered more than most. The great artist was not, in his later years, a great father. He routinely ill-treated his one legitimate son, and he neglected the son and two daughters he had outside of marriage. Still, when he died in 1973, they inherited some of the fruits of his talent and, in three cases, his name.    But like many an enviable legacy, it became a poisoned chalice. Picasso's heirs, including his widow, Jacqueline Roque, squabbled for six years over distribution of thousands of paintings, sculptures and drawings worth hundreds of millions of dollars. They then differed over how to exercise their communal right to exploit the Picasso name commercially until a French court settled the issue in 1989.

But three others, Florence Quivar (Federica), Vladimir Chernov (Miller) and Jan-Hendrik Rootering (Walter), were new to these roles at the Met.   And two singers made company debuts. The tenor Michael Sylvester, in the demanding role of Rodolfo, seemed overmatched. He showed promise at the start, with a nice clarion ring, but spent his strength quickly. His tone grew grainy and ultimately coarse, with a sense of strain painfully evident. The mezzo-soprano Victoria Livengood, as Laura, produced a lovely dark sonority, even and well supported.

In the local public library 20 years ago, you couldn't satisfy your curiosity about sex, but you could do the other thing adolescents have always needed and wanted to do: You could read about yourself, both in the cheery, reassuring light of the ''older children's books'' and in the colder eye of a J. D. Salinger.\\n\\n Starting in the late 1960's, a distinctly new kind of book for teen-agers began to appear, reflecting a changing balance of power between the generations. The domestic upheavals of the late 60's shook the traditional faith that adults could provide sure moral guidance or a safe haven for their young. As the first surge of postwar Baby Boomers took the cultural lead, college students redefined youth as a time of experience rather than innocence, and their younger siblings and some of their elders paid admiring attention. In this climate, editors and writers of children's literature began to issue novels marked ''14 and up'' or ''12 and up'' that dealt realistically, if not graphically, with sexual maturation and social problems.

The musical accompaniment, which plays a very important part in the development of the story, is fitted to the action with a master hand. No spectator is likely to forget in a hurry the finale where the hero, watching a group of revolting factory workers being marched off toward Siberia, suddenly recognizes that the tune to which they are singing their defiance to Czarism is one of his own compositions.B. Dobron Ravof, as Yegor Yefimof, the young serf violinist whose display of genius, combined with his stubborn courage, wins him his freedom and a large sum of money from his music-loving lord of the manor, is convincing all the time. From the very beginning his demeanor prepares the audience for his consistent refusal to cater to the powers that be in the official and art world of St. Petersburg, although this consistency spells misery for his wife and child and a certain kind of mental torment for himself. A. Gorunof is efficient in the rôle of Shultz, a routine fiddler whose sycophancy brings him wealth and fame, after Yegor has captured the heart of his fiancee (Miss Tarasovna).Naturally, the Soviet producers lay emphasis upon the humiliating position of real artists in the Russia that ended with Nicholas II and show the beginnings of the revolutionary propaganda among the workers and peasants.

Barrie's \\"The Little Minister\\" has received generally faithful, if somewhat broadening, treatment on the screen, under the direction of Penrhyn Stanlaws, who offers it at the Rivoli this week as his second motion picture production. It commits no such sacrilege against its original as did \\"Male and Female\\" against \\"The Admirable Crichton,\\" but it is not so genuinely Barrie as \\"Sentimental Tommy\\" was. Nor is it so expressive pictorially.It is, however, an unusually interesting photoplay, its chief virtue being its consistently well-composed settings, and its principal weakness being due to its dependence upon conversational subtitles. For the settings, Mr. Stanlaws, presumably, is responsible, and in them he gives evidence of the pictorial sense which he was expected to bring to the screen. They not only convey the desired impression of Thrums, but are pleasing as pictures, easy to comprehend with the eye, and strengthened by the restraint with which they have been composed. Every change of scene in the photoplay brings a new visual pleasure.But, though the settings provide a stimulating atmospheric background for the story, they are seldom parts of expressive moving pictures. The characters walk into them, talk and walk out. The talking means, of course, that the scenes are unintelligible until subtitles are brought on to tell the spectators what everything is about. And, as usual, this is not effective. Pictures which continuously depend upon words are incomplete, and never satisfying.This excessive wordiness is characteristic of most screen adaptations of novels and plays, and a good deal of it, no doubt, could not have been avoided. But it does seem as if Mr. Stanlaws might have substituted independently expressive moving pictures for many of his incomplete word-and-picture scenes. Perhaps in later pictures he will become pictorially expressive, and if he does, he will prove a director of exceptional, and at the present time almost unique, value to the screen, for his work in his first two productions shows him to be appreciative of screen values to which many others are insensible, and he appears, too, to have a discerning sense of the dramatic.His present production is immeasurably helped by Betty Compson in the rôle of the self-determining Babbie, who, as everyone knows, or should know, though the daughter of Lord Rintoul, would much rather scamper about Thrums disguised as a gypsy than move sedately through the halls and rooms of her father's castle. To this part Miss Compson brings the essential humor that is Barrie's, and her pantomime is also accurately expressive, often giving meaning to scenes that would be pointless without it. George Hackathorne, as the little minister himself, whose stern Scotch religionism is a barrier between him and the supposed gypsy girl until his human nature comes to the top, is not so well suited to his part. He is self-conscious, his stiffness and formality seeming rather assumed for the moment than a part of the man. Mary Wilkinson, as old Nanny, contributes a vivid characterization to the story however, and Guy Oliver makes the rebellious Tammas definitely forceful. The others in the cast, though well made-up as types, do not help the illusion much by their acting, some of them tending to overdo their parts and others doing little or nothing at all.Considered then as a photodramatic work, \\"The Little Minister\\" is weak in some particulars and strong in others, but taken simply as a customary photoplay, it is well above the average on nearly every count.\\"My Boy,\\" with Jackie Coogan in the principal part, produced under the direction of Victor Heerman and Albert Austin, is the photoplay at the Strand this week, with \\"The Little Match Girl,\\" a Prizma picture, and \\"The Christmas Dream,\\" a staged fantasy in five scenes, also on the bill.\\"Pardon My French,\\" with Vivian Martin, directed by Sidney Olcott, is at the Capitol, with Harold Lloyd's latest comedy, \\"A Sailor-Made Man.\\" There are also seasonal musical and dancing numbers.\\"Rent Free,\\" with Wallace Reid, directed by Howard Higgin","excerpt":"a new issue of Tony Sarg's Almanac; another Funny Face comedy, and stage numbers suited to the week, make up the program at the Rialto.

The completed piece, which received a full-bodied but minimally staged performance on Monday evening at the Delacorte Theater, ranks as one of Ms. Swados's most rewarding scores. Like much of her work, it also resists conventional categorization, although folk opera might be the closest definition.    Its simple story follows the movements of an American tourist who is led around contemporary Jerusalem by a cynical guide who makes grim wisecracks about the city's future. When he tries to persuade the traveler to become a prophet, the story deliberately alludes to the biblical account of Jeremiah, who foresees the destruction of the city but whose warnings are met with ridicule until he is eventually forced into exile.

The marina is well positioned for the big residential development that the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development is planning for the 300-acre site it owns in the same Rockaways community.   The slips at the marina, the Sommerville Marina and Yacht Club, rise and fall with the tide and boats are being accepted for winter storage, the builder, MarineLand Inc., says. The marina's name was picked from the local navigation charts of Jamaica Bay, where Sommerville Basin flanks the western shore of Edgemere Park.    The marina, at 59th street and Beach Channel Drive, has been built to accommodate boats ranging in length from 25 to 45 feet. Space for smaller boats may be added later, the developer says.    Sales of Bayliner pleasure boats will begin next month, with maintenance and repair facilities and operations to follow in the spring. A clubhouse is scheduled for construction in about three years.   \\"There are over a million people in the surrounding south shore communities and several thousand registered boaters with no place to tie up as fine as this,' said Rick Anzola, vice president of MarineLand, which has its offices in Manhattan.    The marina may add 100 more slips in coming years, he said.

In the 1950's, long after the hill was quarried out and carted away to fill in the dips in Atlantic Avenue, the pre-Revolutionary name was revived as Cobble Hill to lend a historic association to a neighborhood that had recently been discovered by brownstone buyers.   Now, in the familiar pattern of urban land use, the one- and two-family brownstones are being joined by apartments, most recently by a 70-unit, nine-story condominium called Tiffany Mews, which has been created within the former Mullins furniture warehouse and workshops.   The developers, the Cuneo-Leider Management and Development Corporation of Manhattan, hope that a doorman condominium with three top-floor penthouses will appeal to Brooklynites, particularly those who want the views of lower Manhattan that the building offers from some of its 6-foot-9 windows.    The building stands on Tiffany Lane, one of the neighborhood's cobbled streets, between DeGraw Street and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Parking spaces in an adjacent commercial building, also slated for conversion, are being offered.

C., focuses on the signing of the Pendleton Act by President Chester A. Arthur on Jan. 16, 1883. Named after its sponsor, Senator George H.

The tube inflates at the same time that the sail fills up with wind, and it remains inflated because check valves in the tube prevent the air from escaping.

The soprano goes insane upon hearing that her beloved tenor has betrayed her, enjoys several episodes of demented coloratura and returns to sanity immediately when the report proves unfounded. Within that improbable frame, however, Bellini created a score that has attracted and tested famous singers for more than a century and a half. On Thursday evening, the first \\"Puritani\\" of the Metropolitan Opera season found Edita Gruberova challenging for a place in the mad-scene pantheon as Elvira, the emotionally volatile Puritan maiden.   Although the work contains three juicy parts for male singers, in our time at least it has been dominated by virtuoso sopranos, among them Maria Callas, Beverly Sills, Monserrat Caballe and Joan Sutherland. Miss Gruberova, in fact, was shadowed all evening by the memory of Miss Sutherland, who was the vocally astonishing Elvira of the present Met production's premiere in 1976 and hardly less remarkable in the role four years ago, at age 60. Miss Gruberova, walking in the footsteps of a legend, could well have been unnerved, if for no other reason than that the conductor for this, her first Elvira at the Met, happened to be Miss Sutherland's husband and vocal guru, Richard Bonynge.

Still, if Mick Jagger can go ahead and turn 50, why shouldn't Ms. Burstyn -- who has publicly sworn she will do one play a year, come what may -- be allowed to play Alfred Uhry's Miss Daisy, as she did in Chicago five years ago, or Carrie Watts, the slyly willful old woman in Horton Foote's \\"Trip to Bountiful\\"?

It is a 13-story turn-of-the-century structure with a granite and terra cotta facade that was commissioned by the industrialist Henry Clay Frick as part of his early real estate ventures. Mr. Allen has proposed a $7 million conversion to create 120 apartments for the elderly.\\n\\nThe Highland Building is opposite the East Liberty Presbyterian Church, a landmark Gothic structure anchoring the East Liberty neighborhood, which contains mostly single-family homes and low-rise commercial and retail buildings. The area has deteriorated somewhat in the last several years, and a nonprofit community group, East Liberty Development, is charged with charting a new course for it.\\n\\nThe Highland Building, owned by the North Highland Building Corporation, now has only one tenant -- the regional office of the state's Department of Environmental Services, which leases 62 percent of its 107,000 square feet. East Liberty Development fears the property will lose value if it is not converted.\\n\\nApprovals are needed from the Zoning Board of Adjustment and the City Planning Commission. And negotiations are under way with the city's Urban Redevelopment Authority to finance an portion of the conversion.\\n\\nThe Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency is expected to pledge $3 million toward the project, said the agency's information director, Phillip Friday. Other funding, he said, will come from bond financing, the City of Pittsburgh, the developer and a syndicate of investors. In the last three years the agency has given $24 million to help convert outdated commercial buildings in western Pennsylvania into housing for the elderly.\\n\\nThe U-shaped Highland Building has small rooms and is better suited to housing than to continued use as an office structure, said Karen LaFrance, director of East Liberty Development. Plans drawn up by Lorenzi Dodds & Gunnill, local architects, would create mostly one-bedroom apartments, which would rent for $325 a month, and some two-bedroom units, at $385 a month. The income limit for prospective single residents would be about $16,000 a year, and for a couple, $20,000. \\n\\nA local concern, the National Development Corporation, recently converted two of its downtown buildings into housing for the elderly. An 18-story structure underwent a $2 million conversion into a 94-apartment house, Midtown Towers, and the May Building now contains 125 apartments.

They used to think that little was happening during the 10-year period when an infected person is usually free of symptoms, and so, perhaps, treatments were not as important. But two papers published last week show that during that time the virus and the immune system are fighting to the death, with a billion or more new viruses being released each day into the bloodstream and a billion or more white blood cells dying each day in the battle to keep the infection under control. The body, in the meantime, churns out replacement forces at the rate of a billion white blood cells each day. And the virus only wins, in the end, because it has the slightest statistical edge in the fight.    Perhaps the most discouraging news was that the AIDS virus can almost instantaneously become resistant to new drugs. One of the research teams, headed by Dr. George M. Shaw of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, gave a drug, nevirapine, to people with AIDS virus infections. The drug destroyed 99 percent of the virus in their bodies.

Encountering people during their small moments of trauma -- expelled from their car or home, or fretful that they are unsafe from strangers or spouses -- he daily views an exponential variety of small passion plays conducted through locked doors. He sees the astringent bickerings of the love-torn, the sabotages, the absent-mindedness.

At a crowded concert on Friday night at Irving Plaza, Ms. Moyet's fans stomped and hollered wildly as she belted out songs that were severely hampered by a tinny sound mix and a shoddy backing band. Whenever her voice began to soar, the music dragged it back down. The guitar strumming sounded flat, while the synthesizer lines lacked punch.

But increasingly, rappers in other countries are using their music to reflect on and grapple with their local realities, adding their own flavor to an American art form.\\n\\n Why is a music so closely identified with the rebelliousness of young American blacks catching on far from its homeland? Rap's rising popularity may have to do with the reasons it has been vilified in this country. Rap is abrasive, loud, often crude and disrespectful of melody and traditional pop-song structures, say its critics. But such irreverence lends it an aura of danger and exhilaration, which speaks to the restlessness inherent in youth.

Not long ago, we noted in passing that a specialty of the restaurants of New Orleans is a poached-egg dish called eggs Sardou. It is named for the French playwright Victorien Sardou (1831-1908), who is best known as the author of ''La Tosca,'' the play on which Puccini's opera was based. It is a lesser-known fact that Sardou traveled in America and wrote a satire on the country entitled ''L'Oncle Sam.'' Presumably, it was during these travels that he visited New Orleans and was entertained at Antoine's Restaurant. The owner, Antoine Alciatore, created the egg dish in his honor.   Eggs Sardou is a dish remembered from my childhood, and I rate it, along with eggs Benedict, as one of America's finest creations. It consists of poached eggs served in artichoke bottoms crossed with anchovy fillets. The eggs are then served with a bit of hollandaise sauce spooned on top, along with a garnish of truffles and/or finely chopped ham. Some recipes call for creamed spinach as a base on which to place the artichokes","excerpt":"a nice idea, but not, I believe, a part of the original.

Counting off a fast \\"Jumping at the Woodside,\\" the four, along with a rhythm section from the Clayton band, started to swing. Mr. Edison squeezed out taut, piercing notes, using rhythms to bang home his idea.   Then came Mr. Tate. Once a star saxophonist in the Count Basie Orchestra, he now moves with great difficulty since an automobile accident a few years ago. He appeared very frail as he was helped to a stool next to the others. Then he put his horn to his lips and produced a huge, raw sound. Though he didn't have that much facility, everything about his improvisation was heroic, not just because he was there at age 77, but because the sweeps and rhythms of the solo were so unwilling to be denied their eloquence. The excitement in the hall was palpable.

No other choreographer has ever received so large-scale a tribute.   Above all, it is a season, running through June 27, that promises new connections among familiar works and rarely performed ballets when seen in new contexts.

They were lullabies not for children, but for adults, particularly those of Mr. Taylor's baby-boomer generation, who are trying to come to terms with their vanishing youth and diminished expectations. To them, and perhaps to himself, Mr. Taylor offers soothing, good-natured counsel, most of which boils down to: you've suffered enough, enjoy what you have and think kindly thoughts. \\"Since we're on our way down, we might as well enjoy the ride,\\" he crooned in \\"Secret o' Life.\\" Review/Pop","excerpt":"A Night of Lullabies For Baby Boomers"},{"year":"1992","title":"With so many outdoor music festivals in the vicinity of New York City, it can be easy to regard them as a generic mass.

The extent to which each festival has its own personality is a function of entirely extra-musical details, like setting and scenery.

But at 6:45 p.m. on Nov. 13, Kozmo's home page had a notice saying the site would be down until 8 p.m. for an upgrade. New York consumers rarely get what they want on the first try anyway, so it seemed natural to try UrbanFetch.com, a new, competing digital delivery service.     UrbanFetch sent an e-mail whizzing right back saying that ''L.A. Confidential,'' ''The Americanization of Emily'' and a pint of Starbucks Coffee Vanilla Cashew Crunch would arrive between 7 and 8 p.m.     But when 8:30 passed without videos -- but with visions of soupy ice cream -- a phone query seemed in order. The UrbanFetch customer service man said that Kozmo's problems meant that his company was deluged with orders and having trouble meeting demand. But no need to worry: the videos had been dispatched.     A quick check of Kozmo.com, meanwhile, found a new notice saying that the site would be down until the next day.     When the UrbanFetch order had not arrived by 10:30 p.m., an attempt to cancel by telephone and e-mail got no immediate response. The delivery man eventually materialized around 10:50 p.m., some four hours after the order had been placed. He wasn't buzzed in.     ''We certainly don't strive to run our business this way,'' Ross L. Stevens, the chief executive for UrbanFetch.com, wrote in an unsolicited e-mail that arrived the next day. ''The reality is that during this start-up phase, a small percentage of our orders are handled in a less than perfect manner and unfortunately your order fell into that small group.''     Both companies are chary about releasing specific numbers, so the scale of the jumble is unclear. But Alison Bloom, a spokeswoman for Kozmo.com, said that Saturday-night customers usually generated from 1,000 to 1,500 orders and upward. Mary Maselli, a spokeswoman for UrbanFetch, would say only that its orders doubled on Nov. 13 and that the usual standard of 99 percent of deliveries meeting the one-hour delivery deadline had been lower that night.     The Kozmo.com upgrade, which had begun at 3 a.m. that Saturday, was finally completed the next day. Joseph C. Park, Kozmo.com's chief executive, said the company gave $5 discount coupons to more than 10,000 customers who tried to log on from the cities it serves: Boston, New York, Washington, San Francisco and Seattle. The upgrade was designed to ease the flow of orders on the single Web site that handles all five cities.     ''It was probably a trying thing for some of our customers to go to Blockbuster to rent a video,'' Mr. Park said. ''They really depend on us for delivery in under an hour.''

She played platinum-haired prostitutes, gold diggers and other trashy types with no apologies. In \\"Red-Headed Woman,\\" she strategically places a picture of her rich, married boss under her garter and says, \\"It'll get me more there than it will hanging on the wall.\\" In \\"Red Dust,\\" she decides to take a bath in a rain barrel, the better to get Clark Gable's attention. And in \\"Hold Your Man,\\" she fights a rival for Gable's affections by belting the other woman with a left to the jaw, twice. Yet in her seven-year career, Harlow was wildly popular with both men and women, who found more to envy than to scorn.   The Harlow retrospective that begins today at the Film Forum is a vastly entertaining reminder of a brief and fascinating career, one that ended when Harlow died of kidney failure in 1937, at 26. And the series suggests something more. Harlow's garishly dyed hair, pencil-thin eyebrows and heavy eye makeup mark her as a sex symbol left over from the day before yesterday. Yet in film after film she sails into the present carrying along her most prized and timeless possessions: a clear conscience and a sense of humor. Harlow was an exaggerated symbol of what middle-class America wouldn't dare embrace in real life: sex without guilt. In the AIDS-aware 90's, the allure of that persona and the wit with which she brought it off hit with the fresh force they must have had five decades ago.

Miss Nissen gives a remarkably easy and charming impersonation of a fascinating and resourceful young bride, who rebels against being neglected for the roulette table by her gambling-mad husband.Miss Nissen is a Scandinavian with a Parisian cachet. She is fair, and the dressing of her blonde hair impresses one as having an influence torn between alarm and mischief. She arranges it differently, by brushing it down, when she is to wed a second man. Miss Nissen is sure, natural and graceful in her expressions and movements: she times every lengthy scene to perfection and is never awkward or out of character. She is alert and seemingly gives just as much attention to her hands and feet as she does to her constantly changing gaze. She has a somewhat decided nose and chin and is attractive, rather than beautiful. Her wild coiffure is more effective than when her hair is hidden by a small hat. She has a decided and delightful personality, and one never knows by a single look of her eyes that she is conscious of the camera or the director. No matter how frivolous the scene may be, Miss Nissen gives a sincere and earnest portrayal, always obtaining excellent results with an originality rarely beheld on the screen.The amusing incidents in this film are told in a scintillating manner. The story, impossible though it is, becomes infectious and keeps one's eyes steadily on the picture. There are many imaginative and deft touches in William De Mille's direction, the story having obviously appealed to him. He has retained craftily, but cautiously, the French flavor of the original production.Adolphe Menjou acts the part of the husband, Tony Hamilton, who because of his gambling propensities is known to a coterie of friends in France as \\"Bet-a-thousand-Tony.\\" He is ready to wager on anything, and as a result of a bet and his incidental daring, he wins Charlotte (Miss Nissen), who he carries away from her own engagement party, the host at which is her fiancé, the Duke de Val. The following evening the honeymoon couple are at a Riviera casino, where Hamilton is intrigued into a roulette game in a room to which only men are admitted. He sends word to his bride to return to their hotel, but she refuses to do so, and the playing lasts seventy-four hours. Baron Deliguieres (Edgar Norton), a foppish flirt, after paying attention to the resolute Charlotte, sends her a present of a bed on which to rest, as she declared her intention to stay at the casino so long as her husband was gambling.Hamilton is subsequently called to New York through the illness of his father, and after a year has passed he receives word that Charlotte has divorced him and is to wed the Baron. Hamilton rapidly calculates that he may be able to reach France in time to stop the wedding. He is, however, just too late, as when he throws open the church doors, he finds the place empty. Later he deliberately smashes his automobile at the portals of the Baron's chateau, and then he pretends that he has sprained his ankle. He is carried into the house, where during the Baron's brief absence he pays court to his former wife. There ensues an amusing sequence in a room, where Hamilton is eventually hidden behind a portière. This is ingeniously pictured, as one has an occasional glimpse of Hamilton's head behind the curtain while Charlotte is arguing with the timid Baron.Mr. Menjou gives a skillful performance, equaled only that of Miss Nissen. Mr. Norton is roundly efficient as the Baron, while Mario Carillo is sympathetic as Hamilton's chum, George, Eugenio di Liguoro is excellent in the rôle of the casino propreitor. The whole cast is unusually competent.This is a most amusing picture, which has been handled cleverly by Mr. De Mille.

John Downing, manager of the Oceanography Group at the Battelle Marine Sciences Laboratory in Sequim, Wash., said the device can be used as \\"an environmental sentinel,\\" tracking pollution and other water characteristics, including temperature and conductivity. It is modeled after Navy antisubmarine warfare probes, which are attached to ships by a pair of copper wires and dangle in the water.

Her first story for the screen was shown in photoplay form at the Capitol Theatre last week and it seems to contain evidence that she has had some experiences in the cinema world not altogether to her taste.In the first place, this picture was originally announced as \\"Noblesse Oblige,\\" which apparently was the title Mrs. Atherton gave it. When the announcement appeared last November, however, the present writer ventured the prediction that the title would never see the screen. He is not gifted with any special powers of divination. He's just been doing the movies for more than three years—and \\"Noblesse Oblige\\" came out as \\"Don't Neglect Your Wife\\"!And the story seems to have undergone certain alteration and adaptation calculated to make its final title more fitting than the name Mrs. Atherton gave it. It starts out as an historical romance of the 60s, and, though not especially original in plot, it nevertheless presents an interesting and, presumably, a trustworthy view of social life in the San Francisco of the period. It is provided with settings and characters that give it verisimilitude. And when the action switches to the famous Five Points of New York, the interest in it is increased by the addition of the new environment and its contrast with the earlier setting. Clearly Mrs. Atherton's idea was to present a story of a period and of people vivifying it. Evidently she was less concerned with plot and action as such than with character and setting. The surmise is that her story had the interest of history touched with romance.But this is not the story filmed as \\"Don't Neglect Your Wife.\\" Although it starts well enough, and does arouse interest in its place and people, it soon degenerates into an uninspired movie melodrama, incredible, homiletic and conventional. Its people become automata, acting as no human beings ever acted, obviously stalking through a mechanical plot. The ending is a foregone conclusion to any one sufficiently interested to anticipate it. Surely Mrs. Atherton did not write \\"Don't Neglect Your Wife.\\"But this is not to say that what she did write was suited to the screen. In all probability she wrote an excellent novel, parts of which have reached the screen and are a great deal better than the movie stuff in which they are imbedded, but the point is that she wrote a novel. Or so it seems. There does not appear to be any evidence that she composed a photoplay. When working up her story, did she think in terms of phrases and sentences or in terms of moving pictures? Was she novelist or cinematician?CONCERNING the remarks about the photographic effects of \\"The Conquering Power\\" and the question of the distribution of credit for them, which appeared in this column week before last, J. E. D. Meador of the Metro Pictures Corporation writes:\\"Mr. Seitz is a photographer among a hundred but, at the same time, the unusual and striking photographic effects that have been obtained in these productions of Mr. Ingram's are largely the result of Mr. Ingram's own ideas in composition and photography. As strange as it may seem, in getting these remarkable results, he uses less light than any of our other directors.\\"In reference to Charles Albin's criticism of the omission of Mr. Seitz's name from the list of those responsible for \\"The Conquering Power,\\" Mr. Meador says that full credit is given the photographer in the prints and publicity matter put out by Metro, and that, wherever his name does not appear on the screen, it is because the exhibitor has taken it out, presumably to shorten the running-time of the picture.IT is estimated by Ray Rockett that the average five-reel photoplay is composed of about four reels of pictures and one of subtitles, and he thinks that the proportion of the latter is too large. His comment on the subject follows:\\"The motion picture is a story told in vizualized action by players working to a definite purpose. It is a drama in living pictures. The subtitle as originally used had for its sole purpose the explanation of things that could not be told by the action or to express the passage of time. A clever subtitle may get a laugh, but it is the action of the play that people pay to see.\\"The argument that mental action cannot adequately be expressed by mimetic art without the use of a spoken subtitle is a fallacy. More real dramatic action may be put over in a close-up showing repression than in all the shouted subtitles that ever were written. Many an actor spoils the effect of his work by letting his body get in the way of his mind, but properly interpreted mental action will not need a subtitle to explain it. A subtitle should be used wherever necessary, but that is the end of its usefulness, otherwise the photoplay of the future will evolve into a thing which will be more like a film of illustrated subtitles than a motion picture with subtitles as merely incidental to the pictorial text.\\"Physical action is but a good, bad or indifferent reflection of mental action and, if good, few words of explanation are needed—if bad, subtitles, no matter how clever, will not save the picture. A lesser element is that pictures are more easily understood by the common mind than written text, and the subtitle must not go over the heads of the proletariat.\\"Again, multiplicity of subtitles makes impatient the man who goes to see pictures, and the straining after effects to subtitles is as distressing as meaningless scenes in the picture.\\"The ideal picture is one with the dramatic action interpreted as nearly perfectly as skilled playing and direction can do it with the fewest possible subtitles, but those also lucid, pat and clever.\\" SCREEN","excerpt":"A NOVEL IN THE MILL"},{"year":"1935","title":"Article on vines for screens FLOWERING SCREENS","excerpt":"A Novel Method of Support Makes Their Culture Easy"},{"year":"1970","title":"MAMARONECK, N.Y., July 9 &#8212","excerpt":"A novel method was intro duced today to vanquish that old golfing bugaboo&#8212;slow play.

No other building type is more characteristic of this country or more expressive of the desire to make one's mark on the horizon, an impulse common among those attracted to the profession of architecture. Yet the dismal results of most tall buildings show how even talented architects can fall victim to the lure of size at the expense of quality. High-rise design is pitiless in its exposure of the shortcuts and economies often demanded by speculative real estate developers. As Cass Gilbert, architect of the Woolworth Building, said many decades ago, \\"The skyscraper is a machine to make the land pay.\\"\\n\\n One New York architect who has been trying to steer clear of commercial pitfalls is Steven Holl, head of his own small office and a professor at the Graduate School of Architecture and Planning at Columbia University. Mr. Holl, 43, has shunned the extremes of post-modernism as well as the more recent fad of deconstructivism in favor of a personal vision that is nonetheless far from middle-of-the-road.

This is one of the sharper comments in his show, part of the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.   In keeping with his self-characterization, Mr. Gomez-Pena takes a militant stance on a variety of ethnocentric issues. He is filled with attitude but proves to be a wavering communicator of his own grievances. Even on its own kaleidoscopic terms, his play is fragmentary. It is a series of broad impersonations, played against an eclectic background of recorded Spanish music. As a performer of his own work, he seems to have a limited range, in contrast to such monologuists as Eric Bogosian and John Leguizamo, who can populate an entire stage with their chameleonesque personalities.

The players, Mark Taylor, Tom Varner, John Clark and Vincent Chancey, have fairly impressive avant-garde credentials, ranging from associations with Sun Ra, Muhal Richard Abrams and Henry Threadgill to John Zorn and LaMonte Young. But they left those credentials at home, for the most part working a soft instrumental area that mixed jazz improvising with pop textures.   Mr. Varner organized the festival, which is named for an early jazz French horn player in New York. Of the four musicians, he turned in the most inspiring set. Backed by Ed Schuller on bass and Steve Johns on drums, Mr. Varner did some improvising, breaking up be-bop phrases with long melody notes. He's at the point where lines, complicated but logical, hurtle to their destiny. Mr. Varner took apart the melody of Thelonious Monk's \\"Let's Call This,\\" playing the theme alone, letting little bulbs of the melody hang glittering, breaking up the tune with silences.

In the beginning, the animals are totally exploited by their human owners. After their revolution, there is a brief period when the animals labor for themselves alone. By the end of the book, the animals might be said still to work only for animals, but they might as well be working for human farmers, since their animal rulers are the pigs, who now walk about on two legs, wear clothes, sleep in beds, swill beer and are  exactly as exploitative as the humans they have replaced.
