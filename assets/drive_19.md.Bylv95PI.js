Though not too steep, the slope is steep enough for children to be challenged, and it is wide enough to accommodate a large number of skiers with little or no experience. There are two rope tows; when group lessons are taught on one side of the slope, one of the two is shuts down. (Children often think the rope tow is the best part of skiing.) On Sunday, many parents were putting their first-time skiers between their legs and going downhill; others enticed them to ski a few feet into the safety of a parent's arms. Most of the children had no poles, and few were heard whining or crying. They were thrilled.   LESSONS: On holidays and weekends, the resort offers two children's packages for those 3 to 12 years old that offer a blend of skiing and other activities like craft-making and baking. The cost is $32 for a half day or $45 for a full day, including lifts, but equipment rental costs $10 extra. There are also daily group classes whose price ($44 for children 5 years old and up; $51 for adults) includes lift tickets to the beginner slopes and equipment rental.   THE WAIT: We thought we were clever to choose Super Bowl Sunday for an outing, but Vernon Valley was still a popular destination. Waits for some chairlifts lasted about 15 minutes; others were shorter. The rope-tow line at Chicken Little moved quickly when there were no stumbling bodies.   SUSTENANCE: Vernon Valley has three restaurants: one upstairs with views of the mountain, serving fare like chili and burgers; one below, specializing in pizza, video games and adolescents, and one upstairs with a bar and a more sophisticated atmosphere. Smoking is allowed. (There are other restaurants at the Great Gorge area of the resort.)   THE MOOD: This is the Jones Beach of ski resorts; it's not a mecca for the cultural elite and doesn't pretend to be. The surrounding landscape is eclectic, but from the top of the mountain the view is spectacular. It is an easy drive along Route 80 from the New York City area, without too much traffic. The resort attracts a large number of eager beavers, boisterous families and audacious first-timers.   THE COST: Adult lift tickets: $36 for a day (8:30 A.M. to 5 P.M.); $26 for a half-day (1 to 5 P.M.); $32 for twilight (3 to 10 P.M.); $26 for night (6 to 10 P.M.); $51 for a learn-to-ski package with limited lift ticket, rentals and group lesson. Children's lift tickets (ages 5 to 12; anyone younger enters free): $29 a day; $22 a half-day; $27 for twilight; $22 for night; $44 for a learn-to-ski package. Rentals: adult skis, boots and poles, $21.50; junior skis, boots and poles, $16.50; snowboards (skateboards without the wheels), $26.50.   HOURS: Mondays through Thursdays, 9 A.M. to 10 P.M.; Fridays, 9 A.M. to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 8:30 A.M. to 11 P.M.; Sundays, 8:30 to 10 P.M. Through March 31. Craigmeur Ski Area Green Pond Road (off Route 23) Newfoundland Morris County (201) 697-4500    THE RESORT: Craigmeur, in rural New Jersey near Stockholm and Lake Telemark, was opened in 1937 by Hugo Muiry, an Austrian immigrant. Devoted to beginners, Craigmeur, with a 300-foot drop, is not ashamed of its small size and mild-mannered slopes. It offers four slopes, three for beginners and one intermediate; a chairlift, T-bar and two rope tows; night skiing, cross-country trails (which may be closed if there is a lack of snow), snow-making machines for the slopes and a cafeteria. Lodging is available nearby.   THE BUNNY SLOPES: On one very wide hill with gentle bumps and relatively stable stretches, lots of parents were towing children downhill by hand, harness or pole. Some parents were on the slope without skis, coaching their children on skis. The two rope tows were not running (the management said it operates them when the slopes become crowded), so the real challenge was riding back up on the T-bar or the chairlift.   LESSONS: The Humpty Dumpty class, for 3-to-6-year-olds, lasts about 45 minutes; the children stretch, bend their knees, ski through a row of poles and learn to stop, all without poles. There was noticeable improvement by the end, and parents had their camcorders running. Humpty Dumpty classes, including equipment rental, lifts and the lesson, cost $20 on weekdays and $28 on weekends. The Ski Eagles class, for children 5 to 12 years old, includes lunch and costs $45 for a full day and $25 for a half day. Rentals are extra: $10 for a full day, $6 for a half-day. Ski Friend is another program, in which parents may hire a teen-ager to ski with a child for $12 an hour.   THE WAIT: Short, although the large number of beginners means there are many brief shutdowns as novices gather themselves up after falling off the T-bar or recover from descending off the chair lift.   SUSTENANCE: The food is acceptable, but you might prefer to pack a picnic lunch. The top-of-the-mountain restaurant has picture windows overlooking the Copperas Mountains and offers a close-up view of people getting off the T-bar (which one child called \\"the hook\\"). Polyurethaned wooden picnic tables indoors give the restaurant a rustic feeling and make it easy to spend the afternoon reading while others ski. Smoking is allowed.   THE MOOD: Family, family, family. Here parents may rediscover why they had children as everyone basks in the low-key atmosphere, surrounded by other beginners. The resort is not difficult to find driving on Route 80 from the New York City area.   THE COSTS: Full-day lift tickets: $26 for adults; $22 for juniors, children aged 7 to 12; $12 for children 6 and under. Half-day (8:30 to 1 P.M. or 1:30 to 5 P.M.): $20 for adults; $17 for juniors; $12 for children. Twilight (3 to 10 P.M.): $26 for adults; $20 for juniors; $12 for children. Night (5 to 10 P.M.): $20 for adults and juniors; $12 for children. Rental of skis, boots and poles: adults, $17; children 6 and under, $12. Snowboards: $18.   HOURS: Mondays through Fridays, 9 A.M. to 10 P.M.; Saturdays, 8:30 A.M. to 10 P.M.; Sundays, 8:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. Through March 31.

On Wednesday evening, Gianfranco Ferre, who also designs the Christian Dior collection, was the first of the grand-scale players to come to bat. Krizia, which helped develop this city as Italy's fashion center, opened the games this morning.   But at noon, it was Gianni Versace who set off the first explosion of the season. He showed a collection of gorgeous excess, mixing 18th-century romanticism with modern jeans. Where other designers were tentative, he was forceful. He displayed a complete understanding of what makes fashion work, both the rational and the irrational elements. And so this collection will have a powerful influence. Presented with such authority and conviction, it is destined to attract its own stream of followers. Here is what to watch for.

It is also learnable in three rehearsals.   As played by the St. Louis Symphony at Carnegie Hall on Friday night, Mr. Maxwell Davies's 23-year-old single movement turned out to be somewhat different. It is 40 minutes long and follows its own path in its own time. For its first quarter hour, quietness reigns: lapping and overlapping string lines underneath, transformations of 13th-century monody expressed through horn and high trumpet solos. \\"Worldes Blis,\\" depending on your point of view, is courageous in the face of short attention spans, or else it is indifferent to the casual listener's expectations.
