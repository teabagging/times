But with such momentous significance was that osculation endowed that it was blazoned to the public with mingled delight and awe. America's favorite moppet had reached the kissable age. No more dolls for Shirley. Little Miss Marker had grown up.Oh, boy, what a whale of a difference just a few—or, precisely, three—years make! And what a remarkable transformation the current Miss Temple represents! She is now a married woman. Her autobiography was published yesterday. And as for osculation—well, you should see her in \\"Kiss and Tell\\"!This effervescent film version of the stage play came to the Capitol yesterday, and with it came a Miss Temple who is well past the pecking stage. Indeed, she is bordering coyly on the verge of what some might call a flirt, and such thoughts as chase through her noggin might startle her elderly fans. For none of the candid innuendoes have been deleted from the F. Hugh Herbert play. They are all there in frank, unvarnished language. And Miss Temple plays them honestly.You may remember that the nature of this genial domestic farce was not precisely prudish. It had—and still has—to do with the turmoil occasioned in three families by two daughters' shenanigans with boys. And, although the elaborate confusions are quite plainly and willfully contrived—suspended upon a secret marriage which might just as naturally have been revealed—they are of a quaintly scandalous nature and eminently productive of fun.And, by George, you've got to hand it to Miss Temple—she's superb in the leading role, a compound of girlish innocence and female perversity. The leap from her former saccharine didoes into this mildly terrifying 'teen-age role is one that required uncommon talent. The lady has got it—plus looks.She has also got, in this instance, some remarkably competent support, which assures the success of the picture. Jerome Courtland is hilariously genuine as her baffled, but bashless, highschool boy friend","excerpt":"Walter Abel is vivid as her dad, and Porter Hall, Tom Tully and Mary Philips are elaborately amusing as feuding friends. Richard Wallace has directed the performance for continuously cascading farce.

For the world's least defatigable relief pitcher, spring training is a stern regimen consisting of unzipping his windbreaker. He is then ready to work in 106 games during the championship season, two during the pennant playoff and five during the World Series, one&#8208;third of the Dodgers' scheduled games, one&#8208;half of their playoff games, and all their World Series games. At least, that satisfied him last year; he may demand more action this season. &#8220;1 had heard about how often he wanted to pitch and how often he could pitch,&#8221; Alston said, and didn't have to add that he was content to wait and see for himself. In 1973 Marshall had set a major league record by appearing in 92 games, but that was for the Montreal Expos, who finished fourth in a six&#8208;team division.

Therefore this new picture is called \\"70,000 Witnesses,\\" and before it comes to the screen those in the theatre are asked not to reveal how the crime is committed or the identity of the murderer.This film, coupled with a stage show in which are such luminaries as Georgie Price, Will Mahoney, Donald Novis and Eddy Duchin and his Central Park Casino orchestra, yesterday attracted great crowds to the Paramount. It is a mystery story with a good measure of suspense and the slayer is kept artfully in the background until the psychological moment.There are scenes in the football players' dressing room before they go into the game and subsequently one learns of the suspicious activities of Buck Buchanan, a brother of a gangster named Slip Buchanan, who has wagered $350,000 on University defeating State, the team on which Buck plays.Wally Clark is State's star player and on the eve of the game Slip asks his brother to drug Wally with a concoction he gives him in a vial. Buck takes the drug without the least intention of using it, and as he believes that his brother may seek to injure Clark by some other means he is constantly on the qui vive, which accounts for his singular conduct on the field.There comes the time when Clark gets the ball and it looks as though he cannot fail to make a touchdown, but he flops unconscious just as he reaches the five-yard line. Soon afterward he dies and Dan McKenna, head of the local police, is not satisfied with the doctors' ideas of the cause of death or with the decision of a surgeon following an autopsy. He asks to have part of the game re-enacted and through this he succeeds finally in obtaining a confession from the murderer and learning of the peculiar way in which he committed the crime.Parts of the latter episode may not be precisely plausible, but they do not detract from this type of story. Phillips Holmes is highly satisfactory in the rôle of Buck. That veteran of silent films, Lew Cody, does well as Slip Buchanan. Johnny Mack Brown is sympathetic as Wally Clark and Dorothy Jordan is attractive as the girl in the case. J. Farrell MacDonald is excellent as the coach for the State team. Charles Ruggles delivers some clever comedy. Others who do creditable work are Kenneth Thomson, Guinn Williams, now known as Big Boy Williams","excerpt":"Walter Hiers and Paul Page.

He stalks through it with mustachios, enormous eyebrows and glistening white teeth, a large sombrero and chaps, all that might go to make a merely trick bandit, but never hiding Mr. Huston's talent.As the outlaw, Lopez, he straightens out the economic and love entanglements into which his friend Jones has fallen and in so doing falls victim to a ranger's bullet. But before this his amusing discourse on women, the value of bad husbands, the fate of scoundrels and the niche for loan sharks are mixed up with the details of the story.The others in the cast are relatively inferior. O. P. Heggie overacts a cantankerous invalid. Dorothy Revier in the rôle of a maltreated wife is colorless.

For this is one of those dramas of a studied and literate sort which gives the impression that it was written and made between sips of tea. It is one of those films in which the detective drops the careless and casual remark, \\"This strangler fellow is rather giving us a bit of trouble, you know,\\" the tally of the murderer up to that point being a mere six or seven throttled throats. And it is one of those chummy little items in which the inevitable comedy cop is on hand to make suggestions to the inspector based on what his \\"missus\\" thinks.But, being a British picture, it does all this sort of stuff passing well, with an agreeable eye for the color and movement of London crowds. Eric Portman, a little more portly than when he played in \\"The Invaders\\" a few years back, is very genteel and elegantly anguished as the strangler, identified from the start.
