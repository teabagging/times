His wife, Johnie Walker Murphy, preceded him in death","excerpt":"surviving him are: four children; Michael Walker Murphy, Martha Wilson Murphy, Charles Haywood Murphy, III, and Robert Madison Murphy; three sisters, Theodosia Murphy Nolan, Caroline Murphy Winter, and Bertie Murphy Smith; and eight grandchildren. He was born in El Dorado March 6, 1920, the son of Charles Haywood Murphy, Sr. and Bertie Wilson Murphy. Charles Murphy is best remembered as an oilman. His father had him manumitted by court order at the age of sixteen so he could legally transact business for himself, and he entered the petroleum industry on his own as an independent while still in his teens. At the age of twenty-one he assumed full managerial responsibility for his family's business, consisting primarily of oil production, farming and timber lands scattered across Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. For the next fifty-three years (except for three years' service in the U.S. Army infantry during World War II) he devoted his considerable energy to building this business into an international oil company that has been active on every continent except Antarctica. It is now a public company, of which the family still owns some 25%, and it still bears the family name, Murphy Oil Corporation. It is ranked by Fortune and Forbes magazines on some of their various measures as from the 312th to the 370th largest industrial concerns in the United States. Charles Murphy served this organization, under various titles, as its Chief Executive Officer until 1986 and continued as Chairman of the Board until 1994. While building Murphy Oil, Charles Murphy did not forsake his heritage as a banker. He succeeded his father as a major shareholder and dominant force in the First National Bank of El Dorado, which later became part of a group of banks owned by First United Bancshares, which Charles Murphy served as Chairman of the Board. This group of banks has now been succeeded by BancorpSouth Banc. Additionally, Murphy was a major investor in First Commercial Corporation, a significant regional bank holding company, where he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee. First Commercial has now become part of Regions Bank. Less public attention has been focused on Charles Murphy's career as an educator and philanthropist. This is the way he wanted it. He served seventeen years on the Arkansas Board of Higher Education, where he was instrumental in beginning the drive to improve the quality of public education in Arkansas. At the same time, he was dedicated to the improvement of private education as well, and gave generously of his time and money in this cause. He served ten years as a trustee of Hendrix College, where he and his family established the Hendrix Murphy Foundation, providing financial support to the institution. He also served on the Board of Administrators of Tulane University, where he and his family established the Tulane Murphy Foundation and the Murphy Institute of Political Economy. The Murphy Foundation, established by Charles Murphy, his wife, and his mother, provides financial support to both public and private institutions of learning, as well as scholarships to enable students to pursue higher education. For his service in the field of education, Murphy was recognized with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Arkansas in 1966. (continued next column)     Charles Murphy's service to education did not consist only of serving on boards and giving money. He was active as a teacher and lecturer, without fee, on a broad range of subjects, to a variety of audiences. Examples of the breadth and scope of his lectures include: ''The Effect of Environment on Business Strategy'' given at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, ''Energy Alternatives for the Mid21st Century'' at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., and ''Reading, Writing, and Thinking'' at El Dorado High School, El Dorado, Arkansas. That he was able to deal with such a range of subjects is due not only to his powerful intellect, but also to the manner of his education. His classroom education ended with his graduation from High School at Gulf Coast Military Academy at the age of sixteen, but his education continued throughout his life. As a young person he was taught languages, philosophy, history and science in the classical way by tutors, and as an adult he pursued his education by prodigious reading. Charles Murphy is recognized as a scholar by other scholars. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee, widow of the renowned historian, once introduced him as the only person who ever changed her husband's mind. Charles Murphy's public service encompassed more than the field of education. He served his country and his industry and often sought to bridge gaps between different points of view. He served ten years on the National Petroleum Council, including as its Chairman. The Council was established by the United States Government during World War II as a group of leading oilmen to advise the government on matters pertaining to strategic petroleum supply. He also served for ten years and chaired the American Petroleum Institute Conservation Liaison Committee. This committee laid the groundwork for some of today's far reaching petroleum industry environmental programs. For his service he received a citation for Outstanding Individual Service to Natural Resource Management from the National Wildlife Federation. Charles Murphy served his industry through membership on the American Petroleum Institute Board of Directors and its Executive Committee and Management Committee. This group honored him with election as President of its prestigious 25 Year Club and an honorary life membership on the Board of Directors. He was also instrumental in the founding of the National Ocean Industries Association, representing many diverse interests in the use and conservation of ocean resources. Like other facets of his life, Charles Murphy's public service board memberships reflect a broad range-in addition to those already mentioned, he has served on the Board of Governors of the Oschner Medical Foundation, the National Advisory Board of the Smithsonian Institution and the Louisiana Governor's Council on Economic Development. Charles Murphy was at ease with people from all walks of life, from Presidents and Prime Ministers, Kings and Princes, to roughnecks and roustabouts and service station attendants, and he was invariably courteous and charming to all. He was a citizen of the world, with friends and acquaintances in every part of the globe, but he never forgot his roots, his friends included Sam Rayburn, Lyndon Johnson, H. L. Hunt (and his family), Lloyd Bentsen and George Bush, of Texas; Russell Long, John McKeithen, Jimmy Noe, and Bennett Johnston, of Louisiana: Robert Kerr, Dean McGee, Carl Albert, and David Boren, of Oklahoma; and Witt and Jack Stephens, Chesley Pruet, John L. McClellan, William Fulbright, Wilbur Mills, Oren Harris, Sam Walton, Robert E. Lee Wilson, Dale Bumpers, David Pryor, Ray Thornton, Jay Dickey, Bill Clinton and Mike Huckabee, of Arkansas. He was on personal terms with every President of the United States from Truman to George W. Bush and his acquaintanceships extended to such diverse contemporary historic figures as James Schlessinger, Lady Margaret Thatcher and the Shah of Iran. When he discovered an oil field on tribal Indian land in Eastern Montana, he was inducted into the Assiniboine-Sioux Tribe and made a honorary chief, and he accepted this honor with the same grace as he accepted an honorary LLD from the University of Arkansas, the Roughneck of the Year Award from the American Petroleum Institute 25 Year Club, and an invitation to conduct a petroleum economics seminar for the National Iranian Oil Company following the Iranian Revolution. He responded with equal courtesy and thoughtfulness to requests for advice from Presidents, Cabinet Secretaries, OPEC Oil Ministers, and the widows of former employees. Charles Murphy left his mark on the times in which he lived. His son Madison said ''The world is left a much duller place by his passing.''

NOWIK believes in returning sacred music to the churches and cathedrals for which it was originally composed. Mr. Nowik, who is the organist and choirmaster for the Cathedral of St. Francis of Assisi in Metuchen, is responsible for creating and administering a series of concerts at the cathedral.\\n\\nThe series was started in 1984, a year after the dedication of the cathedral's new Schantz organ, and concerts have been given every year, the number depending on the money available. In the 1990-91 season, which opened in September, the cathedral is presenting a total of seven concerts, with the second one taking place today at 4 P.M.\\n\\nWith the help of a six-member board, Mr. Nowik has struggled, he said, to maintain the concert series, which is financed by donations. The diocese and the cathedral, he said, do not contribute additional funds, and the budget for this season is only $17,000. \\n\\n\\"My hope is to show people that this sacred music was written for the church and that's where it belongs, not in the concert hall,\\" he said. Mr. Nowik said he also wanted to show people that they did not have to go to New York to hear fine music. \\n\\nThe series, he said, reflects a strong commitment to the community on the part of the cathedral. The audience comes from \\"an amazingly wide radius,\\" Mr. Nowik said, adding that since the cathedral is only two blocks from the Metuchen train station, many people come from Trenton, Newark and other locations on the train route.\\n\\nAlthough the sacred choral works on today's program will be performed in a concert, Mr. Nowik said one of his dreams has been to perform many of the Masses during theactual service every week.\\n\\n\\"Hearing the movements of the Mass separated through prayers,\\" he said, \\"is very different from hearing it in a concert, movement after movement. It was not intended that way. It gives you chills to hear the music as part of the Mass. I do think these things will be restored.\\"\\n\\nAt this point it is not being done often because the Mass would have to be sung in Latin, he said.\\n\\n The program this afternoon involves a collaborative effort between the St. Francis Cathedral Choir and the First Presbyterian Church Choir of Metuchen, directed by Brenda Day. A total of 75 choristers will perform.\\n\\nMembers of the Brunswick Symphony Orchestra will make up the orchestra. Vocal soloists will be Suzanne Kompass, soprano","excerpt":"Susan McAdoo, mezzo-soprano; Ted W. Barr, tenor, and Glenn Boothby, baritone.\\n\\nAll the soloists, along with Mr.Nowik and Ms. Day, are alumni of Westminster Choir College in Princeton. \\n\\nMr. Nowik will tour Canada with his choir next June, and Ms. Day's choir will travel to Salzburg, Austria, where it will perform the same Haydn Mass that will be performed this afternoon.\\n\\nToday's program, which will be conducted by Mr. Nowik, with Ms.  Day as organist, will include Haydn's \\"Theresienmesse\\" (\\"Theresa Mass\\"), the \\"Hallelujah Chorus\\" from Beethoven's \\"Mount of Olives\\" and the \\"Te Deum\\" by Bizet. \\n\\n\\"The Haydn work was one of his last six Masses,\\" Mr. Nowik said. He said it was difficult to perform, \\"with very chromatic writing in the Credo movement and a lot of fugal writing.\\" He added, \\"There's some nasty syncopation.\\"\\n\\nThe Bizet \\"Te Deum\\" was written when the composer was 18, as a competition piece in Paris. \\"It is rarely performed,\\" Mr. Nowik said. \\"It was scandalous for its time. It was considered too operatic, and it has a big Gounod-type chorus.\\" \\n\\nThe cathedral holds an audience of 800 people comfortably, and for many of the events it has been filled to capacity. There is no budget for advertising the concerts, but Mr. Nowik has a mailing list of 1,600 people. He conducts five choirs, including adult and children's choirs.\\n\\nThe remaining concerts of the series include a Christmas concert on Dec. 16, a Christmas organ concert on Jan. 6 featuring performances by six organists, choral concerts on Feb. 10 and March 24 and an organ recital by Mark E. Laubach on April 14. \\n\\n Tickets are available for the individual events, or for a $50 contribution two season passes are available.  Although a donation is suggested for every program, Mr. Nowik said, it is the policy of the cathedral not to turn away anyone who cannot afford to make a donation.\\n\\n St. Francis Cathedral, which is accessible to the handicapped, is on Main Street at Elm Avenue, one block west of Route 27. The suggested donation for today's concert is $7 for adults and $1 for children. For information, call (201) 548-0100 or (201) 548-0102.

A number of people prominent in Georgetown's social circle were surprised by the choice, and telephone calls today soliciting their responses often began with comments like the one from Polly Kraft, wife of the lawyer and former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler: \\"Do I know her?\\" She Knows Washington    Mrs. Stock may not be a household name to the Georgetown crowd, but she has long experience in the capital. \\"It's good that no Georgetown ladies know her,\\" said Ms. Tate. \\"She's fresh and unspoiled. She's a hard worker and she certainly knows Washington.\\"   Everyone agrees that the White House social secretary should know Washington so as to navigate the treacherous political waters and the rocky protocol shores.   \\"It's very important,\\" said Muffie Brandon, now director of corporate programming for the Ford Motor Company and social secretary to Nancy Reagan from 1980 to 1983. \\"The intricacies of this city, the nuances of political life and of protocol are not things you can learn on the job.\\"    Mrs. Stock is not new to politics or to Washington. Besides working for Mr. Mondale, she volunteered for the Capital Children's Museum and helped raise the money to open it.  Other Qualifications    Those who know Mrs. Stock describe her as energetic, enthusiastic and creative, highly organized and very professional, qualities that are important in such a sensitive job.   \\"There are toes that don't need to be stepped on,\\" said Ms. Tate. \\"You need to genuflect to certain people. It's important that she knows the traps and avoids needlessly offending people, just in terms of the Hill and the traditions and all the protocol.\\"   Mrs. Stock, who is 46 and lives in nearby Alexandria, Va., graduated from Purdue University, where she majored in elementary education. She has been married to Stuart Stock, a partner at Covington & Burling, for 22 years. They have a 13-year-old son, Chase, who is a student at the Potomac School in McLean, Va.   She is a member of the Overseas Economic Fund's Women in Business Committee and founded the Washington Woman Roundtable, a group of 1,000 female executives who meet every three months to network. She was founder of Washington's \\"Race for the Cure\\" against breast cancer, and helped to organize the same event in New York City.   Mrs. Stock could not be reached for comment.

The newcomer, now at the Rialto, is a somber study of a segment of a lost generation incarcerated in a girls' reformatory. It is drama which merely states a case but rarely generates compassion for its demoralized principals.In contemplating this stark slice of life, Director Alfred Braun has used his script to touch on many phases of temptation and the evil surroundings which helped place those unfortunates behind bars but which only on occasion develops their stories. And the drama inherent in many of the situations is dissipated in discursive dialogue. He has avoided this pitfall in the case of Ursula Schumann, his central character, a nubile and sensitive minor, who has fallen into the hands of the law because of a desperate and misguided desire to pluck her mother from an unsavory and untenable home life.But in their attempts to show that not all the inmates or their reformatory guardians are bad, the scenarist and director tend to be fleeting and inconclusive. Cursory attention is given to Wanda, a tough lass whose downfall is the result of maltreatment by her father, a drunken bistro owner. Elfie is portrayed as being disillusioned by life because of an unlovely love affair and Tiny is there because she merely enjoys swiping things. As one of the enlightened warders, Use Heidenreich, termed \\"Heidi\\" by her charges, works under the theory that \\"education\\" can be effected \\"through love and trust.\\" The head mistress, Irmgard Rechenberg, a hard and uncompromising type, is of the opposite view. And, it is only the near-tragic déenouement which brings that adamant dame around.As Ursula, Petra Peters is both striking and appealing as the hopeless and harried 'teen-ager who is willing to wreck both her own newly-found love and her future for her mother, a weary slave to a dissolute common law mate. Richard Haussler is competent as the art dealer with whom Miss Peters is in love, and of equal effectiveness are Ruth Hausmeister, as the understanding reformatory mistress","excerpt":"Susi Dietz, as Wanda, and Gina Presgott, as the naive and blithe Tiny.

says he reserved option to investigate Goldin's allegations concerning movement of securities into and out of vault; says he has recd no new information to support allegation; case, which began with Goldin's release of 3 audits, revd; Kuh is reptd to have subpoenaed ledgers from Goldin that contain assigned numbers for receipts for vault's securities; Kuh's office also interviews Aldag, who is in charge of unit overseeing vault; Kuh says he has interviewed enough people in earlier inquiry to be 'leaning' toward Scoppetta's exoneration; Scoppetta, who asked special state prosecutor Maurice H Nadjari to investigate Goldin's charge, is reptd by friends to be consulting with lawyers over possibility of libel suit against Goldin; Goldin contends that $114,000 in securities were overlooked because they were not there and, by implication, that someone somehow returned them between Mar 31 and July 29 when Kuh-Scoppetta task force conducted its own check; says that not only had 'bulk' of securities reappeared but also that separate receipts that accompany them 'reappeared,' int; refers to securities as having been 'returned' throughout int but later requests that words be changed to 'reappeared'; says he has telephoned Kuh and Nadjari to say that there are indications that ctfs had flowed back into vault; record keeping described; S D Leidesdorf auditors actually worked inside vault while task force did not enter vault itself but worked at table outside; task force used 2 employes in Controller's office to take out of vault envelopes for accts that Leidesdorf worksheets indicated were 'missing'; auditors were at another table; task force members say that by working in this manner they uncovered numerous ctfs that were mistakenly filed in envelopes belonging to receipts;

What evolves is a somewhat disjointed adventure which is closer to the contrived cloak and dagger school of film fiction than it is to the authentic and more exciting derring-do made historic by the Maquis.\\"Clandestine,\\" in short, is not particularly new in deed nor particularly effective in performance. It has to do mainly with a small resistance group, operating in a unnamed town, which is tracked down by the Gestapo in 1944 while operating a clandestine newspaper. Shifting activities, the group is seen blowing up a munitions train for which hostages are brutally hanged. Later, a couple of Maquis are caught with forged ration cards, tortured, and eventually freed by the resistance forces.Although the producers undoubtedly meant to portray a cross-section of the underground's great work very little of that noble effort is projected. The Nazis portrayed are vicious, snarling brutes, while the men and women of the underground are equally one-dimensional.

What elevated these novels beyond the traditions of the genre was a master plan by the authors to use them as the basis for an exploration of society, and director Widerberg remains faithful to that intent.On one level, \\"Man on the Roof\\" stands as a simple mystery. Who killed Nyman and why? But to discover the answer, it is first necessary to know who Nyman was. A policeman, of course. But what is a policeman? One man's brute, it seems, is another's estimable protector of society's decent people. And finally, when the killer is revealed and begins one of those familiar killing sprees on a roof that drew spectacle-thirsty crowds and ringmasters in the form of importunate television newsmen and squads of specially trained and equipped police and their helicopters, the film becomes a study in the rationality of response.As mysteries go, \\"Man on the Roof\\" is not a difficult puzzle. Straightforward, routine police procedures, carried out in a matter-of-fact way by sometimes weary men, yield the answer.What invests this film with seriousness and a claim on our attention are the characters themselves. They inhabit a real world, and Widerberg sketches them, their environment and their relationships swiftly and deftly. That is true even of some of the few who appear for a matter of seconds, disappear never to be seen again and probably could be dispensed with in the name of brevity.The chief roles are played remarkably: Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt as Beck, with an economy and grandeur reminiscent of Gabin as Maigret: Einer Ronn as his little chief assistant, with a vertical furrow between his brows that speaks volumes","excerpt":"Sven Wollter and Thomas Hellberg as the two younger detectives who mix like oil and water.But behind it all looms Widerberg. \\"Man on the Roof\\" may suffer from a slow section in the middle, but over its length, the director displays several varieties of excellence—from the conjuration of horror by a single eye seen peering through a dark curtain; to the affectionate depiction of a city as background; to the succinct revelation of character; to the concoction of excitement, terror and suspense in the climactic stage. Not the least of his excellences is his willingness, at a time when it seems that technique is everything and coherence nil, to treat his audience to ideas as well.
