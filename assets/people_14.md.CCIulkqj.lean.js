He takes a sympathetic interest in Helen Wardell (Miss Kenyon) who loves Howard, a poor young nester, played by George Duryea. The villain in the piece, a banker named Perkins, offers Montero $1,250 to kill Howard.Unfortunately for Perkins, Howard is Montero's friend, so the bandit demands $5,000 from Perkins to spare his life instead. Perkins arranges a trap which, of course, means little or nothing to the careless \\"killer.\\" He traps the trappers, takes Perkins's $5,000 and presents it with a flourish to Howard and Helen to be spent on a honeymoon trip to New York.The story of the Robin Hood variety of lawbreakers has been told so often that one has a right to expect a better version of the tale. Mr. La Rocque does his best through charm and a carefully distorted accent, to make his r√¥le sympathetic, although the ease with which he outwits the minions of the law becomes a bit annoying as the film wears on.Miss Kenyon, as Helen, does well whenever the story permits, and her acting is excellent in the episode where she believes Montero has killed her sweetheart. A few minor touches of comedy are injected by Jim Donlon as Buck, a superstitious and moon-faced member of the unfortunate posse. \\"Beau Bandit\\" doubtless will be received with cheers by the younger members of the younger generation, but it hardly can be considered adult entertainment.

Louis has undergone a remarkable transformation since 1972, when the spectacular demolition of its high-rise Pruitt-Igoe housing project became an indelible symbol of urban decline. Young professionals drawn to new biotech and medical research industries, as well as a new wave of immigrants from places like Bosnia, are bringing new life to neighborhoods that last thrived a century ago. New loft districts, old civic jewels and revitalized night life are making the old refrain of ''Meet Me in St. Louis'' a welcome phrase again.   LARRY FRIEDMAN    Friday    4 p.m.  1 -- Gateway to the West    A certain type of New Yorker never goes to the top of the Empire State Building, but most St. Louisans are not so jaded about the Gateway Arch (314-655-1700), the stainless-steel structure designed by Eero Saarinen as a monument to westward expansion. A four-minute tram ride takes you to the top for 30-mile panoramic views across the Mississippi (and some unsettling questions about what exactly is holding you 630 feet up). The view on the city side looks down on the Old Courthouse, where slaves were once auctioned and Dred and Harriet Scott began their legal fight for emancipation. While waiting for your tram to the top of the arch, visit the museum below, which tells the story of the pre-expansion West, the Lewis and Clark expedition (which began a few miles upriver) and the settlement of the Louisiana Purchase territories.    7:30 p.m.  2 -- Lofts and Fusion Food    Head north through downtown streets and the city's rich past, from steamboat-era levees and warehouses that Mark Twain would have recognized to the venerable Tums factory. Washington Avenue, lined with buildings that once housed much of the nation's shoe industry, is now the center of a thriving loft district. One of the neighborhood's favorite dining spots is the Red Moon restaurant (1500 St. Charles Street, 314-436-9700), on the ground floor of a terra-cotta loft building and complete with high ceilings, a large open kitchen and a long bustling bar. The pan-Asian-French fusion menu draws a crowd of neighborhood artists, young professionals and gastronomes for specialties like tamarind-glazed whole snapper, pork osso buco and Thai beef sashimi with arugula and mint salad (entrees $13 to $28).    9:30 p.m.  3 -- Postmodern Funhouse    The artist Bob Cassilly spearheaded the metamorphosis of an old International Shoe Company factory into the City Museum (701 North 15th Street, 314-231-2489","excerpt":"admission $12), an idiosyncratic and constantly changing collection of found art like MonstroCity, where kids clamber over old airplane fuselages. At night (until 1 a.m. on weekends), the museum is illuminated by candlelight and draws crowds to features like the Museum of Mirth, Mystery and Mayhem, which reimagines the carnival midways of old. Check out the Corn Dogs Through the Ages exhibition and the Elvis Channeler, which does exactly what the name suggests.    Midnight  4 -- Nectar Nightcap    The trendiest spot in St. Louis might just be the Nectar Lounge (2001 Locust Street, 314-588-0055), below. Don't even think of walking into this ultrahip bo√Æte wearing denim or any other unironic attire. Stay late enough and you may spot a local celebrity like Nelly, the rapper and St. Louisan, at the long center bar while you sip the signature fruit- and nectar-based cocktails.    Saturday    9 a.m.  5 -- Saturday in the Park    Forest Park, opened in 1876 and site of the 1904 World's Fair, is one of the nation's premier urban parks. Its 1,300-acre layout, originally designed by the city's parks commissioner, Maximilian Kern, is substantially larger than Central Park. Statues abound in Forest Park: King Louis IX of France -- the eponymous St. Louis -- has a place of honor on Art Hill, and unbeknownst to many locals, a 23-foot Confederate memorial erected in 1914 by the Ladies Confederate Monument Association is tucked away elsewhere. The St. Louis Zoo (1 Government Drive, 314-781-0900, free), made famous by its former director Marlin Perkins, features a walk-through wrought-iron birdcage, built for the 1904 World's Fair and filled with dozens of native avian species. The St. Louis Art Museum (1 Fine Arts Drive, 314-721-0072; free), designed by Cass Gilbert, is known for its pre-Columbian and German expressionist holdings. Or just glide through the park's lakes and lagoons on a paddleboat or rowboat rented at the Boathouse (6101 Government Drive, 314-367-3423; $15 an hour); you can also have lunch there ($10 to $15 a person).    2 p.m.  6 -- North Side Confections    North St. Louis has seen better days, but its reputation as a no-go zone is undeserved. One standout is Crown Candy Kitchen (1401 St. Louis Avenue, 314-621-9650), which draws customers from far beyond its dilapidated neighborhood of 19th-century row houses. Owned by the same family since 1913 (and with equally unchanging d√©cor), Crown Candy offers homemade ice cream cones and sundaes. The 24-ounce shakes and malts ($3.55 to $4; if you can drink five in 30 minutes, they're free) are served in the tall metal canisters in which they were mixed; you pour them into the old-fashioned curved glass yourself. At Christmas, Easter and Valentine's Day, lines are out the door for homemade chocolates and other candies.    4 p.m.  7 -- This Tour's for You    The giant Budweiser sign at 12th and Lynch Streets marks the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch Companies (314-577-2626). The oldest buildings on the 100-acre grounds go back 150 years, and the brewery is still among America's largest. Tours leave frequently, last about an hour and offer a close-up look at large-scale brewing and, of course, the Clydesdale horses. Visitors over 21 can also sample the brewery's finished products in the Hospitality Room. (Last tour leaves at 5 p.m. in the summer, 4 p.m. other times; all tours are free.)    6 p.m.  8 -- Sarajevo on the Mississippi    The South Side streets adjacent to the Anheuser-Busch brewery have always been polyglot. German, Irish and Italian immigrants have given way to Thais, Mexicans and Bosnians. In fact, this is one of the country's largest Bosnian neighborhoods, and Grbic Restaurant (4701 Keokuk Street, 314-772-3100; entrees $12 to $30) is a local institution. The Grbic family redesigned an old brick dairy to resemble a southern European hearth kitchen with a large fireplace and antiques on the walls. Try the goulash, cauliflower schnitzel, stuffed cabbage and shashlik. Leave room for palacinke, a Bosnian crepe confection with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.    8:30 p.m.  9 -- Duck Walk on the Wild Side    The rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry electrified the world with songs like ''Sweet Little Sixteen'' and ''Back in the U.S.A.,'' but St. Louisans were more impressed that his lyrics usually mentioned his hometown. Mr. Berry is still going strong at 79 and performs one Wednesday a month at Blueberry Hill (6504 Delmar Boulevard, 314-727-4444); you might be lucky and catch an impromptu cameo on Saturday night when other local and national acts perform. The sidewalks of the surrounding Delmar Loop bar and nightclub district are dotted with ''Walk of Fame'' plaques honoring St. Louisans like T. S. Eliot, William Burroughs, Tennessee Williams, Redd Foxx, Masters & Johnson and Josephine Baker.    Sunday    9 a.m.  10 -- Flour and Flowers    Get some of St. Louis's best doughnuts at World's Fair Doughnuts (1904 South Vandeventer Avenue, 314-776-9975), where Terry Clanton turns out a variety of classic glazed and cake doughnuts (try the buttermilk ones, 47 cents each) while you watch; his wife, Peggy, helps out and works the counter. Then head around the corner to the Missouri Botanical Garden (4344 Shaw Boulevard, 314-577-9400; $8, free for children under 13). The gardens were originally the country estate of an English immigrant, Henry Shaw, who turned it into a public garden in 1859. It has since become a world leader in plant science, biodiversity and conservation. The 79 acres include Shaw's original home, a Japanese garden and an indoor conservatory for rare tropical trees and plants.    Noon  11 -- An Ikette's Banquettes    Robbie Montgomery, above right, was an Ikette with Ike and Tina Turner and sang backup for the Supremes and the Rolling Stones. She came home 10 years ago to open Sweetie Pie's in suburban Dellwood. A second location at 4270 Manchester Avenue (314-371-0304, $8 to $15 a person), features a friendly staff, Southern-style d√©cor, gospel music on the stereo and soul-food classics like pork steak with gravy, ribs, chicken, sweet potatoes and peach cobbler.    THE BASICS    The Lights Are Shining Again       Lambert-St. Louis International Airport is 20 minutes by cab from downtown St. Louis. You can also take the MetroLink light rail system, which stops near Forest Park and the Delmar Loop; other areas are best reached by car.      The classic Chase Park Plaza hotel (212 North Kingshighway Boulevard, 314-633-3000; www.chaseparkplaza.com), near Gilded Age mansions in the Central West End, offers great park and skyline views that come at a price: $250 and up for most rooms.      The Hyatt Regency St. Louis at Union Station (1 St. Louis Union Station, 314-231-1234; www.stlouis.hyatt.com; $109 and up), is within a renovated train station that is now a shopping and restaurant venue; the old vaulted waiting room is the hotel's lobby and a great place for a drink.

Mr. Abdullah, the trumpeter, was an interesting figure in the jazz scene of the late 1980's: a free-jazz musician intrigued by rhythmic vamps that gave his work a cohesion. (He played briefly with the great drummer Ed Blackwell as well as with the tenor saxophonist David S. Ware.) He has been in charge of booking Sistas Place, a new storefront jazz spot, and here presents his own band with the violinist Billy Bang, the French hornist Vincent Chancey and the guitarist Masujaa.

ANTI-POP CONSORTIUM, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, at 11th Street, East Village, (212) 420-8392. The ambitious underground hip-hop of the Anti-Pop Consortium arrives in a flood of polysyllables. Over the laconic, dislocated beats of E. Blaize, the rappers Priest, Beans and M. Sayyid wrap stories and self-promotion in similes and allusions so fast and densely packed they could use an instant replay. Tonight at 10","excerpt":"admission is $10 (Jon Pareles).    MARCIA BALL, B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. The statuesque queen of the boogie-woogie blues piano takes her rollicking barrelhouse music to this swank new supper club. It's always fun to see Ms. Ball wield her considerable keyboard talents and Louisiana-meets-Texas charm. Don't miss the opening band, the excellent Little Charlie and the Nightcats from Oakland, Calif. Tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $30 (Ann Powers).    * CLARENCE GATEMOUTH BROWN, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Clarence  Gatemouth Brown may be the quintessential Gulf Coast musician. Born in Louisiana and reared in Texas, he soaked up music from the Delta to the bayou to the panhandle, and in his repertory, nothing separates the blues from country or jazz or Cajun music. Whether singing, playing blues guitar solos that jab and moan or reaching for the untamed cry of a Creole fiddle, he's an American master. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; admission is $25 (Pareles).    CHICK COREA, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. It's the end of a week of solo performances from Mr. Corea, one of the most virtuosic players in jazz, with a minutely calibrated touch and a strong sense of rhythm. He's been exploring the form lately, having released two solo-piano records a few months ago on his own label, Stretch. Sets are at 9 and 11:30 tonight through Sunday night; cover charge is $45 at the tables, $30 at the bar; $5 minimum at the tables, one-drink minimum at the bar (Ben Ratliff).    * KEVIN COYNE, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055; Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, at 11th Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Kevin Coyne may be the only blues singer who paints in the Expressionist style, publishes books about Elvis and teddy bears, once worked as a therapist for the severely disturbed and releases albums with titles like ''Sugar Candy Taxi.'' And he almost got Jim Morrison's job in the Doors! It is a privilege to see this English eccentric free-associate. He doesn't come to New York that often, so don't miss these shows; you won't see another like them this year. Tonight at 8 at the Knitting Factory; admission is $10. Sunday night at 8 at Maxwell's; admission is $10 (Powers).    ELVIS CRESPO, GEORGE LAMOND, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-2672. With his shoulder-length hair and his baby face, Elvis Crespo is a pop pinup across Latin America. Born in New York and reared in Puerto Rico, he passed through the Latin kiddie-pop institution Menudo (like Ricky Martin) and went on to join another pop outfit, Grupomania. Then he hopped islands for his preferred style: merengue, which comes from the Dominican Republic, though he still sings a few ballads and salsa tunes. He shares the bill with a more gifted vocalist, George Lamond, who (like Marc Anthony) rediscovered salsa after getting his start in dance music. Tonight about 10; admission is $10 before 10, $20 after, or $30 with a reserved table seat (Pareles).    ENON, STARLIGHT MINTS, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, at 11th Street, East Village, (212) 420-8392. Some bands rock; others lurch and sway and crunch. Enon includes Brainiac's guitarist and a rhythm section from Skeleton Key; its songs are utterly polymorphous, veering from clattering minimal syncopations to melodic rock, but never shying away from noise. Starlight Mints, from Norman, Okla., places Allan Vest's smart-alecky surrealism over a bare-bones framework of simple drumbeats and garage-rock guitar chords. In various songs from its new album, ''The Dream That Stuff Was Made Of,'' the band suggests the B-52's, David Bowie, the Fall or the Standells, but never for very long. Starlight Mints performs tomorrow night at 10:30., followed by Enon at 11:30; admission is $8. (Pareles).    EL GRAN COMBO, JOHNNY PACHECO, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2672. Formed in 1962 and on the Latin charts consistently ever since, El Gran Combo has (along with Sonora Poncena) become one of Puerto Rico's definitive salsa bands, pitching eager romance amid hard-driving percussion and horns. It trades sets with the flutist and band leader Johnny Pacheco. Mr. Pacheco was born in the Dominican Republic but fell in love early with Afro-Cuban music. He has been a prime mover in New York Latin music since the 1960's, when he helped start Fania Records. He went on to lead the Fania All-Stars, the band that defined New York salsa. Tomorrow night at 11; admission is $15 before 11, $25 after, or $35 for a reserved table seat (Pareles).    SONNY FORTUNE QUARTET, Jazz Standard 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Fortune, a saxophonist, plays hard, having first made his name breaking through the heavy crust of Miles Davis's early-70's electric bands. He can still bruise a stage with his energy, playing a straight-ahead jazz set. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $25 cover charge, $10 minimum ($18 cover, $10 minimum for the midnight sets); Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with an $18 cover and $10 minimum (Ratliff).    CHARLIE HUNTER, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. The guitarist Charlie Hunter plays breezy funk and soul-jazz, keeping the bass lines bubbling while he simultaneously improvises melodically on his eight-string. Some of his music has been better suited for the dance floor than a sit-down place, so this one-nighter at the Bowery seems right for him. Tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $15; $12 in advance (Ratliff).    MAGIC SLIM AND THE TEARDROPS, Chicago Blues, 73 Eighth Avenue, below 14th Street, West Village (212) 924-9755. Morris Holt, a k a Magic Slim, followed the classic Chicago blues trajectory: born in Mississippi in 1937, he went to Chicago in his teens and worked his way up to being a mainstay of the South Side club circuit, playing hard-luck blues with guitar solos that poke and jab over his band's lean, assertive vamps. Tonight at 9:30, 11 and 12:30; admission is $15 (Pareles).    NEW ART JAZZ QUARTET, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. In its moment, 20 years ago, James Blood Ulmer's unorthodox jazz-guitar playing hit New York music like a meteor. Rock and jazz both claimed him; his bright, slashing chords and figurations dovetailed so well with all the post-Ornette, pre-Medeski Martin and Wood, punk-funk-free-form styles of the day that his beautiful and somewhat narrow style was spread too thin. Mr. Ulmer has maintained his career well, playing in re-formed versions of several old bands, as well as forming this new, standard jazz quartet, with the pianist John Hicks, the bassist Reggie Workman and the drummer Rashied Ali. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow night. Cover charge is $20 tonight and tomorrow, $17.50 on Sunday; with a $10 minimum all times. (Ratliff).    NICKELODEON ALL THAT MUSIC AND MORE FESTIVAL, Jones Beach Theater, Meadowbrook Parkway South, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000. It's hardly novel now to see very small people going crazy over pop; what grown-up hasn't indulged in a sick-day viewing of MTV's ''Total Request Live''? So this festival, the first directed at the prepubescent set, is now a barometer rather than a herald. This year the curious can see if LFO has anything beyond its hit, ''Summer Girls,'' whether the Irish Spice Girls of Bewitched can ever make it in America, and if the A-Teens, a band that covers Abba songs, can bring the Swedish noise to a new generation. Also performing: I5, My Town, Boyz N Girlz United, Leslie Carter (sister to the established teen idols Nick and Aaron), Nick Cannon, R-Angels, and Plus-1. Today at 5 p.m.; tickets are $15 to $35 (Powers).    OGANS, S.O.B's, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Salvador, the capital of Bahia, Brazil, is a cornucopia of buoyant rhythms and irresistible pop tunes. Ogans, a band of booming drummers backing a singer, plays a repertory of Bahian hits that incorporates both the sophisticated tunes of tropicalia and the frenetic, lightheartedly raunchy songs of Bahia's more recent craze, axe. The band's Brazilian fans show up in force to dance and sing along. Tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 1; admission is $20 (Pareles).    BABATUNDE OLATUNJI, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070. Babatunde Olatunji, from Nigeria, introduced many American listeners to West African rhythms with his album ''Drums of Passion.'' He has since become a kind of cultural ambassador, as well as a dedicated teacher, of African music. To celebrate his 50th year of performing, he has assembled a pan-African group of colleagues: the singer Dorothy Masuka from South Africa, the Moroccan singer and sintir (plucked lute) player Hassan Hakmoun, the Senegalese sabar drummer Lama Bouna Basse, the Nigerian talking-drum player Sikiru Adepoju and Roslyn Burrough, who sings African-American spirituals. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25 to $45 (Pareles).    THE PACIFIC OCEAN, GREEN 4, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, and Rivington, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Connie Lovatt and Ed Baluyut of the Pacific Ocean play pensive tunes with a little guitar noise thrown in, for listeners who like their rock introspective. But the really intriguing band on this bill is the opener, a new project for the daring Mary Timony of Helium. Joined by two female friends, wielding a drum machine, Ms. Timony promises music about bats and birds, for dancing. Sounds excellent! Sunday night at 8; admission is $8. (Powers).    * PANORAMA, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 774-8807, (718) 773-4052 or (718) 625-1515. Before marching in Monday's carnival in Brooklyn, steel-drum (or pan) bands from Brooklyn and the Caribbean unveil their repertories while staying stationary, allowing listeners to savor full-length performances with pealing harmonies and carnival rhythms. In a concert and competition that stretches into the wee hours, a dozen bands each play half-hour sets while judges deliberate. If it's not the world's most jubilant music, it's a definite contender. Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $25 (Pareles).    PRIMAL BLUE, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080. An ad-hoc grouping of some of good straight-ahead jazz musicians: the contemplative tenor saxophonist Javon Jackson, known by his own Blue Note albums, and the rhythm section consisting of Lenny White, Dave Kikoski and Ed Howard, known for their affiliation with dozens of bands around New York. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $25, plus a $10 minimum (Ratliff).    * SOCA FESTIVALS, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 774-8807, (718) 773-4052 or (718) 625-1515. As a warmup to the Brooklyn West Indian-American carnival parade on Labor Day, which starts on Monday at 10:30 a.m. at Utica Avenue and Eastern Parkway, the leading soca stars of the English-speaking Caribbean perform outdoors next to the Brooklyn Museum. Through the 1990's, soca absorbed ideas from reggae, rock and hip-hop, not to mention music videos. Yet between the admonitions to ''jump up'' and ''grind it,'' there's still likely to be plenty of political advice, history and earthy humor. The major carnival concerts start tonight with a show of four ebullient soca bands. On recordings crisp electronic beats often carry new soca songs, but live musicians still propel the high-speed party music onstage; the groups are billed as brass bands. Two video-ready bands, Machel Montano and X-Tatik, and Alison Hinds and Square One, share the bill with Charlie's Roots, the Brooklyn soca band that visiting soca stars often choose for their backup group, and the Blue Ventures. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25. The rhyming, dancing commentators of soca show up on Sunday night at 8, with many past and present carnival kings including the Mighty Sparrow, whose sense of humor and articulate rhymes have made him the most influential calypso songwriter since World War II, and David Rudder, who draws on ancient Afro-Trinidadian drumming along with touches of reggae, along with Sugar Aloes, Red Plastic Bag, King Smarty and Pink Panther; tickets are $25. (Pareles).    * JACKY TERRASSON TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Terrasson, a pianist in his mid-30's, is one of the greatest gifts of his generation to jazz: rhythmically intensive, dramatic, given to long jams with extreme dynamics. The worst thing that can be said about him is that his strings of fizzy little ideas don't cohere; at his best, though, he can floor you. In this quartet he is reunited with the less-is-more-style drummer Leon Parker, one of his best accomplices. Sets through Sunday night are at 9:30, and 11:30, with a 1 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow night; cover, $20 tonight and tomorrow, $15 on Sunday; $10 minimum all days (Ratliff).    DWIGHT YOAKAM, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800. Dwight Yoakam is a honky-tonk die-hard, holding on to the Bakersfield country tradition of Buck Owens as he moans about the women who have broken his heart or done him wrong. His lyrics, which he recently published in book form, are models of concise storytelling; his songs find endless variations on classic honky-tonk forms, sometimes letting in a hint of folk-rock or Phil Spector. Tonight at 8; tickets are $37.50 (Pareles).    * JOHN ZORN'S MASADA, MASADA STRING TRIO, BAR KOKHBA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Mr. Zorn sets up his bands like formulas, and with these three he consistently gives his fans what they want. With echoes of Jewish music and energy jazz of the 60's, the quartet Masada is the hottest band in Mr. Zorn's arsenal. Masada String Trio boils down those tunes to elegant chamber music, and Bar Kokhba makes them over again for an expanded chamber ensemble. Tomorrow night at 8 and 11; tickets are $30 (Ratliff).

Back in the 1980's, when most of the members of All were in the Descendents, they were already meshing punk drive with pop tunefulness. All, formed in 1987, hasn't given up on the idea, even as youthful punk tantrums have begun to share space with admissions of love.

He takes composition seriously -- he's got a passion for odd rhythmic cycles and multiple, intertwining voices -- but this group, with the reed player Chris Speed, bassist Michael Formanek and drummer Jim Black, has the unfussy strength of a good old blowing band.

But Don Cherry also played rock with Lou Reed, and he was one of the first jazz-based musicians to explore in-depth the world's folk and traditional music. In short, Don Cherry is both a jazz master and one of those eternally curious souls who really believes, and acts on, the premise that good music is good music, and categories are for the faint of heart.

Ari Up, a founding member of the post-punk band the Slits, has lately moved closer to reggae. Harriet Tubman is the jazz-rock power trio of Brandon Ross on guitar, Melvin Gibbs on bass and J. T.

Stereolab, an English pop band, and John Cale, an original member of the Velvet Underground, are pop historians of different natures. Stereolab looks low, and Mr. Cale looks high. Grounding their sound in percolating Moog synthesizers and bubbling organs, Stereolab flips through the back pages of mid-century kitsch, singing odes to synthesizers past and obscure musicians who tried to become pop heroes. Mr. Cale, on the other hand, finds his source material in the poems of Dylan Thomas and the annals of minimalism. Even Elvis Presley's \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" becomes a composition instead of a song when he sits down at his piano to perform it while the Soldier String Quartet scrapes and slides in the background.

Bobby Watson emerged from Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers as an alto saxophonist who could go barreling through hard-bop and blues tunes. But in the years he has been leading his own group, he has become something rarer: a player who has moved beyond confident facility to turn musical lines into emotional messages.

The garage-rock bands of the 1960's didn't usually play stadiums, but Barry and the Remains, from Boston, were the exception. With their snarling, minor-key hit ''Don't Look Back'' on the charts in 1965, they became the opening act for the Beatles' last tour.

He's not afraid to tell bad jokes, and his voice, which sounds like that of a pre-teen with a spring cold, is irresistible.

NEIL STRAUSS Still Improvising    Derek Bailey Quartet, the Cooler, 416 West 14th Street, West Village, (212) 229-0785. In the 1980 book \\"Improvisation,\\" the guitarist Derek Bailey contends that improvisation is the most widely practiced musical activity, but the least acknowledged and understood. He ought to know. As a pick-up musician in the 1950's and a studio musician in the 1960's, he learned a lot about discipline and restriction before striking out on his own in search of freedom. Three decades later, he's still twisting his tuning pegs, whittling atonal guitar lines, and breaking for periods of silence. He has become one of the most technically adept performers in a genre that has pretty much remained unacknowledged and misunderstood. He performs with the saxophonist Peter Brotzmann, the drummer Gregg Bendian and the bassist Skuli Sverrisson tonight and tomorrow night at 10. Admission: $10. N.

At the end of one song on Love Jones's first album, a sultry female voice whispers, \\"I'd like to buy the band a drink.\\" Her offer conjures up a world of vinyl seats and smoking jackets, of sensuality and cordiality, of inebriation and restraint that exists only in a misguided vision of the 1950's and in the music of Love Jones. Led by Ben Daughtrey, a reformed hardcore rock musician, Love Jones croons self-consciously slick retro-rock songs colored with light brush strokes of bossa nova, soul and doo-wop. The band sometimes tries too hard to imitate a style of music characterized by its effortlessness, but that's only part of its charm. Doors open at 8 P.M. admission is $8. N. S.

MONTY ALEXANDER TRIO, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)  864-6662.

Ryan Adams is steeped in the right 1960's songwriters -- Van Morrison, Neil Young, Gram Parsons, Bob Dylan -- and lately he has punched up his music with a touch of 1980's indie-rock. He's an unpredictable and ornery performer, but his songs can distill heartbreak, longing and rancor. Ollabelle, which gives bluesy updates to old gospel songs like ''John the Revelator'' and ''Jesus on the Mainline.'' Tonight at 8; tickets are $36.50 (Jon Pareles).    ASYLUM STREET SPANKERS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Sex, drugs, booze, unplugged instruments and anachronistic swing are the makings of the Asylum Street Spankers, who bring an absurd sense of humor to songs that update the spirit of vaudeville.

Latin rhythms have always been a foundation of house music. Now a pair of disc jockey-producers -- Jellybean Benitez, whose most famous client may be Madonna, and Little Louie Vega of Masters at Work -- take over the dance floor at this Latin Club, with Judy Torres adding some live vocals. Tonight from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.; admission is $25 (Pareles).    THE BLACK KEYS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)  533-2111. The Black Keys claim they never heard the White Stripes before starting their own blues-rocking, guitar-and-drums duo. They're far more of a throwback to straightforward 1970's boogie and blues outfits, like Savoy Brown or Ten Years After, than the White Stripes are. Tomorrow night at 1:30, with the Cuts at 11:30; tickets are $13.

The Portuguese songs called fado (fate) balance sorrowful melodies and lyrics about tragic destiny in a gleaming cat's-cradle of fingerpicked Portuguese guitars. It's music that frames a singer's voice while it mercilessly exposes every nuance of sorrow and determination. Cristina Branco is one of Portugal's most celebrated young fadistas. Tonight at 8; tickets are $30 (Pareles).    VINICIUS CANTUARIA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Vinicius Cantuaria, whose songs have been recorded by major Brazilian hitmakers including Caetano Veloso, has lived in New York City since 1995 without leaving Rio de Janeiro behind. He is steeped in the bossa nova, and he knows it well enough to stretch the form without losing its essence. Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $23 (Pareles).    COLONEL CLAYPOOL'S BUCKET OF BERNIE BRAINS, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)  777-6800. That's Les Claypool from Primus on bass and vocals, Buckethead from (briefly) Guns N' Roses on guitar, Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic on keyboards and Brain on drums, in swampy, deep-riffing funk jams with some grim cackling about the state of the world. Tonight at 7, with Gabby La La opening; tickets are $32 (Pareles).    RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)  582-2121. With a slightly withdrawn, low-affect style, making his way expertly through his band's rhythmic twists, the saxophonist Mr. Coltrane has grown a great deal as a bandleader in the last few years. The band includes Luis Perdomo on piano, Drew Gress on bass, and E. J. Strickland on drums. Sets tonight at 9, 11 and 12:30; tomorrow night at 8, 10 and 11:30; and Sunday at 9 and 11 p.m. Cover charge, $30; minimum, $10 (Ratliff).

In ''Sorrow's Forecast,'' on an album Dead Moon released last year, Fred Cole sings ''I could have made the right moves/been a smooth pop singer.'' That seems unlikely. His voice quavers and swoops like that of Pere Ubu's David Thomas, and the three-piece band he started in 1987 -- with his wife, Toody, on bass -- plays songs that sound as if they came from 1966, when garage-rock was turning psychedelic. At Mercury Lounge tonight at 11:30, with Antietam at 10:30, Blood on the Wall at 9:30 and Dynasty at 8:30; admission is $12. At Maxwell's tomorrow night at 9:30, with the Little Killers and the Ribeye Bros. opening; admission is $12 (Pareles).    RAMATAOU DIAKITE, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Ramatou Diakite is a singer from the Wassoulou region of Mali, where women have a tradition of singing to entertain and instruct. The songs mix elements of Arabic and sub-Saharan Africa, with driving triple-time rhythms behind her fervent voice. Tomorrow night at 10, with disc jockeys playing African music till 4 a.m.; admission is $20 (Pareles).    * FRANZ FERDINAND, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. A sly, stylish Scottish band in love with well-tailored bass lines and stiletto-sharp guitars. The group's self-titled debut album (which recently won Britain's prestigious Mercury Music Prize) is full of taut, trebly songs that reduce new-wave to its skin-and-bones essentials. A highlight of the album -- and of the band's live show -- is ''Michael,'' a raucous (and not-exactly-earnest) gay love song, where singer Alex Kapranos gasps, ''Michael, you're the boy with the leather hips/Sticky hair, sticky stubble on my sticky lips.'' Sunday night at 6:45, with the Delays; tickets are $22.50 (Kelefa Sanneh).    * ROBERT GLASPER TRIO, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Mr. Glasper, from Houston, is a young pianist with an excellent trio that's been gathering strength in New York clubs over the past five years. He brings out student enthusiasms: big Errol Garner chords, Herbie Hancock harmony, Keith Jarrett group-improvisation tactics, Oscar Peterson speed. But his group has its own crisp, skittering cooperation, with hiphop in its bounce, reaffirming swing and destabilizing it in equal measures. Sunday night at 8 and 10; cover charge is $15 and there is a $10 minimum (Ratliff).    * COLEMAN HAWKINS CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION WITH LEW TABACKIN, ERIC ALEXANDER, JOE LOVANO, DEWEY REDMAN, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. Coleman Hawkins is the other titan having a 100th birthday this year, and as the starting place, more or less, for the tenor saxophone in jazz, he's directly responsible for a lot of the best players we hear today. An excellent crew will do him honor: Mr. Lovano, gusty and discursive; Mr. Alexander, blues-edged and Coltrane-inspired; Mr. Redman, a musician with a poetic, smoky style; and Lew Tabackin, a super-elegant narrative improviser and the most Hawkinslike of the lot. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $$30 at the tables with a $15 minimum, $20 at the bar with a one-drink minimum (Ratliff).    KISS-FM CLASSIC SOUL, Manhattan Center, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan; Ticketmaster, (212) 307-7171. Soul oldies from Cuba Gooding (of the Main Ingredient), the Intruders, the Persuaders and Force MD's. Tomorrow night at 7; tickets are $45 to $75 (Pareles).    JASON LINDNER'S JLECTRIC, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)  242-1063. A new band for a young pianist whose projects have ranged around from big bands to Latin music to electric fusion; the band includes the bassist Avishai Cohen, the saxophonist Jacques Schwartz-Bart, and the singer Claudia Acu√±a. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 a set, members, $10 (Ratliff).    LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO DAVID BOWIE, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. The many guises and huge song catalog of David Bowie are grist for the fond and sardonic pop archivists in the Loser's Lounge, returning to one of their favorite repertories. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $20 tonight, $25 tomorrow (Pareles).    STEVE MCKAY'S RADON/BARBEZ/NIK TURNER AND SPACESEED, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)  358-7503. Steve McKay was the free-jazz saxophonist who honked wildly through the 1970 album by Iggy and the Stooges, ''Funhouse,'' and he's leading his current band. Nik Turner, also a saxophonist, was a founding member of Hawkwind. Barbez, a group that includes a theremin and a marimba, brings a whiff of tango and cabaret to a repertory that encompasses Kurt Weill and the Residents. Tonight at 8; admission is $10 (Pareles).    * BRAD MEHLDAU QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Mehldau's trio is one of the quintessential jazz groups of the day; it goes a long way in defining the current devices for group improvisation, and the music has a neat aesthetic frame around it, consistently offering a streamlined sound, full of precise dynamics. This week the group is joined by the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, whose command of harmony and astringent, focused improvising has created many admirers over the last decade. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $30 (Ratliff).    TIFT MERRIT, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111 and Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn (718) 230-0236. Somewhere between Emmylou Harris and Lucinda Williams, Tift Merritt sings country-rock that can be plaintive and compassionate or dip into Rolling Stones riffs; she knows her way around heartache. At Bowery Ballroom tonight at 11, with the Damnwells at 10 and Chris Stamey at 9; tickets are $15. At Southpaw Sunday night at 8:30, with Chris Stamey opening; tickets are $10 (Pareles).    * DANILO P√âREZ TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. P√©rez is one of the most rhythmically and harmonically sophisticated pianists in jazz, and his collaborations in the last few years with Wayne Shorter and Steve Lacy, as well as his own ambitious solo records, have been worth hearing. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $25 and $20 on Sunday (Ratliff).    RJD2, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamburg, (718) 599-5103. As a disc jockey and producer, RJD2 has made a mark in underground hip-hop with productions and remixes for Aceyalone, Aesop Rock, El-P and Cannibal Ox, as well as his collaboration with the rapper Blueprint in Soul Position. He likes crisp funk drum breaks overlaid with brooding chords for a mixture of heft and introspection. He's billed on his own tomorrow night at 9, with Diplo and Rob Sonic opening; tickets are $13 in advance, $15 tomorrow (Pareles).    * PATTI SMITH/TELEVISION, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Harking back to CBGB circa 1976, this concert pairs the punk-rock pioneers who didn't repudiate hippie memories. Love, death, transfiguration and pushy guitars have been Patti Smith's staples in the quarter-century since she turned her poetry into punk-rock. Always unpredictable, she still seeks shamanic revelation with every gig. Television revolves around Tom Verlaine's imagistic lyrics, the entwined guitar riffs he shares with Richard Lloyd and modal jams that can lead to places punk-rock never returned to. Tomorrow night at 6:45 ; tickets are $35 in advance, $40 tomorrow (Pareles)    SUPERGRASS, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village (212) 353-1600. Glam-rock yearning meets some punk propulsion in the songs of Supergrass, an English band now celebrating its 10th anniversary that can often sound like it was formed in 1972. Tomorrow night at 7, with the Twenty Twos opening; tickets are $25 (Pareles).    GRADY TATE, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)  255-3626. Grady Tate has been a swinging, audience-pleasing jazz singer since the 1960's, and a drummer as well. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum (Ratliff).    * THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. They Might Be Giants, the songwriting team of John Flansburgh and John Linnell (est. 1982), are masters of the bouncy tune and the unlikely, nerd-friendly topic: presidents, palindromes, thermostats, loud clubs, Dr. Evil. Their latest works, once available by extremely low-fi answering machine, are now on www.dialasong.com. With their television themes, movie songs, albums, commercials, concerts and children's book, they are among the busiest acts in pop, and they are playing two different sets for their two-night stand. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, with Demetri Martin opening tonight and Travis Morrison opening tomorrow; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 on the day (Pareles).    * VIA TANIA, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733. Last year, this South Africa-born, Australia-based singer released ''Under a Different Sky'' (Chocolate Industries), laying breathy, insinuative songs atop filigreed beats and shimmering textures. For ''In the Deep,'' she chose a diffracted jazz groove to match her murmurs; ''I Dream Again,'' with the alt-hip-hop producer Prefuse 73, starts with an angular beat that slows and stops just before she starts singing. Tonight at 8, with Astronauts of Antiquity, Kristeen Young and Heidi Saperstein; tickets are $8 (Sanneh).    LIZZ WRIGHT, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8770. The singer Lizz Wright is only in her mid-20's, and her repertory, as of now, includes some originals, some songs by the drummer and composer Brian Blade, and some spirituals, theater songs and jazz standards. You can find her first album, ''Salt,'' in the jazz department of record stores because it's on a jazz label (Verve) and because jazz musicians (including the pianist Jon Cowherd, her musical director) play in her band. But she doesn't show much evidence of being any sort of traditional jazz singer -- rhythmically, gesturally, technically. She's a pop-gospel-folk-R & B kind of person, with a voice that abhors overstatement. Sunday night at 7:30 and 9:30; cover charge is $30 (Ratliff).    * YERBA BUENA, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn (718) 230-0236. Yerba Buena meshes rumba rhythms, and other Afro-Cuban and Caribbean styles, with gutsy, distorted guitars to create pan-American party music with deep roots. Tonight at 8:30, with Pacha Sound System featuring DJ Nova and DJ Greg Caz; tickets are $15 (Pareles).

RON AFFIF TRIO, Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 601-1000. Steeped in Wes Montgomery and George Benson, Ron Affif is an intensely rhythmic player, as you can see for yourself every Monday night at the Zinc Bar. With his well-practiced trio, he's playing this new club's jazz brunch on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and there's no cover (Ben Ratliff).    * BAMBOLEO, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Bamboleo is one of the top bands on Havana's dance circuit, playing timba, a hard-driving fusion of salsa, funk, Latin pop, jazz and anything else that keeps a club audience in motion. With three singers who all take solo turns and share backup harmony, it's a one-band revue. And even songs that start out like ballads end up, sooner or later, as a danceable crossfire of horns, keyboards and percussion.

Susana Baca has made musicological studies of Afro-Peruvian songs, but she has also followed her clear, knowing voice in less purist directions, fusing her Peruvian band, with its modal delicacy, with New York musicians. For these shows, her band will be joined by John Medeski on keyboards, and they're likely to introduce some new material from an album they're recording next week.

Los Amigos Invisibles are indefatigable party starters in both their native Caracas and their adopted New York. The band latches on to grooves from the last three decades: James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960's boogaloo, 1970's Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rapping. The lyrics, in Spanish, are mostly blatant come-ons, blurring the line between charm and smarm. Tonight at 11","excerpt":"admission is $20 (Jon Pareles).

It has been both a sad and a celebratory month for bluegrass, with the death of the bluegrass eclectic John Hartford on one hand and the concert tribute to ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' at Carnegie Hall on the other. Tomorrow night, bluegrass month continues with a rare local performance by Mr. Blake, whose acoustic guitar and Dobro playing has graced albums by Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson and Mr. Hartford. Mr. Blake will probably move through songs from his new album, ''Flower From the Fields of Alabama'' (Shanachie) with the confidence of a flat-picking master and the molasses drawl of a Southern gentleman.

A curious duo: Mr. Ali, a drummer known for rhythmic freedom (he was John Coltrane's partner on his wild, final album, ''Interstellar Space''), and Mr. Fortune, a relatively inside-the-boundaries saxophone player.

Tabu Ley Rochereau is a suave crooner who leads one of Zaire's longest-running soukous bands, playing gleaming, lilting, repatriated rumbas. He shares a bill with the Pan Rebels, a Trinidadian steel-drum orchestra that peals out jubilant soca tunes. The club is offering three packages, all including a Champagne toast: one with dinner and reserved seating for $120 a couple or $65 for individuals; one with dinner for $95 a couple and $60 for single tickets, and general admission for $25.

Since the late 1970's, when he was a member of Tuff Darts, punk-rock has meant rockabilly to Robert Gordon. He yowls, leers and swaggers through his own songs and rediscovered obscurities like the testosterone boast of \\"Red Hot.\\" For the early show, Mr. Gordon performs at 11 P.M., following the Hassan Hamid swing band, which begins about 9:30 P.M; tickets are $30 including a Champagne toast.

Fiona Apple's last New York appearance, at Roseland, ended ignominiously when the singer and songwriter, unable to hear herself in the monitors, threw a fit of agony so long and difficult to watch it made ''Saving Private Ryan'' seem like a laugh fest. Maybe her behavior wasn't professional, but she did it for the sake of her music, which is too complicated to be sacrificed to a poor sound system.

Ultra Bide is made up of three young Japanese rockers living in New York City and making hard and heavy music. Its songs squeal in and out of tune, clattering as much as they rock.

The Futurists, who between 1909 and the 1920's exalted the machine age, noise, audacity and eventually war in their paintings and other manifestations were ideological forerunners of Fascism. However, their movement also influenced Cubism and Expressionism and sharpened artists' interest in technology.

Here is a look at some of these museums' newer exhibitions and films, which might explain this neighborhood's popularity with families. Barosaurus Exhibition  American Museum of Natural History Central Park West at 79th Street (212) 769-5000 Recommended for all ages    The museum's Barosaurus is a skeletal still life of facts: it is 50 feet high, with one fossilized neck bone (in a separate display case) weighing 150 to 175 pounds. The dinosaur was dug up in Utah in the 1920's. But this free-standing Barosaurus, craning its long bony neck toward the rosette ceiling in the museum's main entrance hall, seems deceptively real. Shown rearing on its hind legs, protecting its baby from a merciless Allosaurus (who seems about half its height), the Barosaurus is both domestic and warlike. Indeed, the dinosaur, which is on permanent display and was installed in December, seems poised for battle. But as 2 3-year-old visitors pointed out, the dinosaur's head is incredibly small for such a lengthy, cumbersome body, leading the children to conclude that the Barosaurus doesn't have a ferocious bite. (It is, indeed, a plant eater).   The museum is open daily from 10 A.M. to 5:45 P.M. (until 8:45 P.M. on Fridays and Saturdays)","excerpt":"admission is $5 for adults and $2.50 for children. A fast-food restaurant in the lower level is a good place for families to rest and eat before heading to other destinations. Strollers are permitted throughout the museum. A coat check is in the main lobby.  'Amazing Worlds of Weather'  Hayden Planetarium American Museum of Natural History 81st Street, near Central Park West (212) 769-5920 Recommended ages: 7 and up Through November    This 45-minute film, narrated by Al Roker, the Channel 4 weatherman, begins by explaining that humans live under an ocean of atmosphere, which doesn't sound too ominous. Viewers can sit back and hear about this ocean as well as the sun's path, air currents, prevailing westerlies and jet streams in the United States, while special effects bounce lightning storms, tornadoes and wind storms around the dome. Visitors are also treated to climatic facts, among them that the highest temperature in the world has been recorded in the Libyan desert (136 degrees) and the lowest in Antarctica (128.6 degrees below zero); the wettest place is the summit of Mount Haialeale, Hawaii, and New York receives more precipitation than Seattle on average. Ozone, that atmospheric element that keeps threatening to depart, is discussed with computer graphics. The program concludes by looking at other planets' weather systems, information courtesy of NASA's Voyager. Saturn, for example, is decidedly inhospitable to Earthlings: it is rife with ammonia blizzards.   The film is shown weekdays at 1:30 and 3:30 P.M.; Saturdays at 11 A.M. and at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 P.M., and Sundays at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 P.M. Admission is $5 for adults and $2.50 for children ages 2 to 12. Younger children may be uncomfortable with the special effects and darkness. 'Great Stuff'  Children's Museum of Manhattan Recommended ages: 6 and up Through June 1993    Somewhere along the way, children collect things, be it erasers, snow domes or G.I. Joes. The Children's Museum of Manhattan understands this, and its newest exhibition, \\"Great Stuff,\\" is dedicated to this psychological need. The show, which is on the first floor and mezzanine and opened earlier this week, is stuffed with, among other things, private collections (and things gathered by the museum) of: bus transfers, socks without partners, pine cones, chopstick rests and found objects with holes in them (hoarded by a 4-year-old, no less). In addition, there are Pez containers, toy service stations and taxi cabs, soil samples, a working train set, and Ken and Barbie dolls (and friends, like Midge) dating from the 1960's to the present.    The show is generous with interactive devices (using a flashlight, for instance, children can look under a bunk bed for treasures, or they can snoop through chest drawers for an imaginary person's trove). It is also enhanced with bright, painterly murals, which hide more kitschy collectibles. A video of interviews with young New York City collectors reveals their earnestness. Darryl Foy, 11 years old, collects comic books, but more important, he says he intends to pass them down \\"for generations.\\"    Visitors can also create their own collections through games; make funky art (using paper cups, for example); listen to songs played by Shlomo Pestcoe, a museum staff member whose collection of instruments is in the show; design a stamp using magnets, and play a baseball manager. (The mezzanine is devoted to stamp and baseball card collections.)    Younger children are welcome to the show; an unsupervised coat check is available for strollers. 'The Great Kapok Tree'  Children's Museum of Manhattan 212 West 83d Street (212) 721-1223 Recommended ages: 2 to 10 Through June    \\"The Great Kapok Tree\\" is a book written by Lynne Cherry, an author and illustrator; it is also the name of an exhibition at the Children's Museum of Manhattan that is based on Ms. Cherry's book. The show is contained within a long, wide hallway gallery space that keeps children focused on the matter at hand: the destruction of the Amazon rain forest. The first display, a large green \\"tree trunk,\\" is a good lure; if children peek inside, they can see something hiding. The show appeals to younger and older children, with interactive stations that are meant to dramatize how the living entities in the forest need one another. Some of the stations are successful; others, like the \\"Balance of Life,\\" are awkward because the objects fall off too easily. One display entices children to push a button to listen to such calming rain-forest sounds as rushing water, or to smell cinnamon, which is derived from the region. Other displays require viewers to place animal-puzzle pieces within the canopy and the undergrowth of the forest, or to place colored glass pieces of the earth's rain forests in their proper spot, a puzzle with good intentions but slippery to do. The game \\"What Doesn't Belong in the Rain Forest?\\" lets children choose answers (like \\"a large saw\\"). Another conscience-pricking display asks viewers to \\"stamp your hand with an environmental pledge,\\" like switching off lights when leaving a room. Ms. Cherry, who spent time in the Amazon researching her brilliantly colored and evocative book, also has some of her original drawings on display. The gallery is painted in tropical greens and browns and sings with the chattering sounds of the forest so even if younger children aren't sure what a rain forest is, they know it's green and noisy and breathing with life. As one little girl yelled: \\"Oh, I hear sounds! How do we get out of this forest?\\"    The exhibition is also enhanced with readings of Ms. Cherry's book by the museum staff and by regular workshop offerings. The museum is open Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 1 to 5 P.M. and Saturdays and Sundays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $4.  'Ring of Fire'  American Museum of Natural History (212) 769-5650 Recommended ages: 3 and up Through June    The newest natural phenomena in close-up depiction on the museum's wonderfully gigantic screen (and in its comfortable and clean Naturemax theater) are volcanoes and seismic activities. The Naturemax film takes viewers searingly close to the mouths of the regurgitating or quiescent volcanoes that ring the Pacific Ocean.  The title \\"Ring of Fire\\" itself refers to the 30,000-mile circle of about 400 volcanoes from the tip of South America, up the West Coast of North America and eventually over to Indonesia and New Zealand. The film travels from volcano to volcano, while taking a look not only at the beastly eruptions, but also at the people who live in the vicinity of volcanoes.    The movie was worked on by a team of geologists, anthropologists, computer animators and film makers for more than seven years. They captured over-the-rim aerial views of swimming molten lava. On the island of Hawaii, for example, coal-black lava is laced with an orange undertow in Mauna Loa. Smoke rolling from Navidad in Chile is also dramatic to witness on the screen. But the most riveting spectacles are actual scenes from the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, where swaying apartments, cracking freeways and buckling bridges are vividly captured.    The 40-minute film doesn't overburden younger viewers with techno-speak, though the terms geologic plates and techtonic forces are bandied about by volcanologists. The film is accompanied on Fridays and Saturdays by \\"We Are Born of Stars,\\" a 10-minute 3-D film of computer-generated graphics about evolution. \\"Ring of Fire\\" is being shown daily at 10:30 and 11:30 A.M. and 12:30, 1:30, 2:30, 3:30 and 4:30 P.M. The double feature is shown on Fridays and Saturdays at 6 and 7:30 P.M. Admission is $5 for adults and $2.50 for children for \\"Ring of Fire\\" and $7 for adults and $3.50 for children for the double bill.  Keep in Mind     \\"KEYS-TO-THE-CITY KIDS WEEK,\\" sponsored by New York City public school system and the United Way of New York City, in cooperation with Mayor David N. Dinkins and other civic groups, starting on Monday and lasting through next Friday.

You can drop in on a penguin feeding or paddle a kayak in search of floating baseballs in the bay. This stretch of the city south of Market Street, long known for its alternative art and music scene, has matured into a mix of trendy restaurants, gritty bars, swank hotels and warehouses reworked to stage live music. It has a bustling waterfront, a major league baseball stadium and engrossing museums. SoMa's character has been shaped by recent cycles of boom and bust. The district lost some of its edge during the frenzy of the late 1990's, as soaring rents shut down galleries and nightclubs and stock-inflated Internet start-ups moved in. When the high-tech bubble burst, SoMa's landscape shifted once again. Lofts languished vacant, and the well-to-do young people on Razor scooters vanished overnight. Lately, though, new life has sprouted. There is some scruffiness, and you can still duck into a club too cool to post its name above the door. But for all its youthful spirit, SoMa feels more grown-up -- not stodgy, but adult -- than ever, with family attractions by day and energy that lingers after dark.   JOSH SENS    Friday    5 p.m.  1 -- Sake and Sculpture    A split-level space with a split personality, Varnish Fine Art (77 Natoma Street, 415-222-6131) is a wine bar in the body of an art gallery. On Friday afternoons, a post-work crowd gathers, inspecting art installations while sipping pinot noir. Music pulses from the sound system, and house wines pour for $5 a glass. Put away a few sake cocktails (also $5, at happy hour) and you might wind up ordering a steel-and-blown-glass sculpture for $6,200. A few doors down, John Colins (90 Natoma Street, 415-543-2277) is another popular spot to wash away the workweek. The regulars here are younger than at Varnish. And louder. But the surfing films screened on the wall are silent. A bouncer guards the door, but the industrial-chic atmosphere is far from daunting.    8 p.m.  2 -- Dinner at Ame    After years of running Terra, an acclaimed restaurant in the Napa Valley, the husband-and-wife team of Hiro Sone and Lissa Doumani have set up a second shop, on the ground floor of the haute and happening St. Regis Hotel. Their new restaurant, Ame (pronounced Ah-MAY, 689 Mission Street, 415-284-4040), serves a selection of superb sashimi, crudo, ceviche and carpaccio, as well as entrees (thick grilled pork chop with Dijon verjus, $32) that smack of California by way of France. The dining room is elegant but relaxing, with plush seats and lighted silk sculptures that float overhead like underwater creatures. But the most coveted seats are at the sashimi bar. Request whatever sashimi they're serving, or the sake-marinated black cod with shrimp dumplings in shiso broth ($29.50), which deserves its standing as Mr. Sone's signature dish.    Saturday    9 a.m.  3 -- Pick Your Paddles    Grab coffee and house-made pastries at Town's End Restaurant & Bakery (2 Townsend Street, 415-512-0749), then stroll along the waterfront to Pier 38, where City Kayak (415-357-1010) launches its boats. The company's guided Bay Bridge tour ($59 a person) will take you on the water and underneath the bridge, San Francisco's other lovely but less famous span. Enjoy great views of the city before paddling out to McCovey Cove behind SBC Park (soon to be renamed AT&T Park), home field of the San Francisco Giants. You might recognize the cove as the splash-landing point for many a Barry Bonds home run. (It's named for a Giants slugger from an earlier day, Willie McCovey.) In April, when the baseball season gets under way, you can rent a kayak on your own (from $15 an hour, two-hour minimum) and join other boaters in a mad dash for a floating souvenir. Kayak lessons are included with the price of a guided tour. Tour schedules can vary, depending on the tides.    12:30 p.m.  4 -- A New Museum    Museumgoers familiar with the SF MoMa (the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) have a new South of Market acronym to memorize: MoAD (685 Mission Street, 415-358-7200","excerpt":"admission is $8), for the Museum of the African Diaspora, which opened in December. It explores the cultural contributions made by people of African descent as they have spread around the world, through migrations forced and voluntary. Interactive exhibits touch on a range of topics from the influence of the slave trade on Brazilian cuisine to the African roots of Charlie Parker's jazz.    3:30 p.m.  5 -- Lunch of the Penguins    If emperor penguins, as portrayed in ''March of the Penguins,'' don't exactly have it easy, African penguins, as displayed at the Steinhart Aquarium (875 Howard Street, 415-321-8000; $7 admission), don't exactly have it rough. The penguins, whose natural home is off the coast of southern Africa, are fed twice daily (at 11 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.) by aquarium staff members, who dole out herring while educating visitors. The Steinhart's permanent home is across town in Golden Gate Park, but that site is being completely rebuilt. So the aquarium will remain in its temporary SoMa space until 2008.    5:30 p.m.  6 -- Cocktails at CoCo500    Classics like the mojito and the caipirinha join concoctions like the lemongrass bloody mary (lemongrass-infused vodka, tomato juice and sriracha chili sauce; $9) on the cocktail menu of CoCo500, a new SoMa restaurant (500 Brannan Street, 415-543-2222). It's almost always humming, but it's the house special drink, the CoCo500 cocktail (Thai basil, kaffir lime vodka, fresh lime; $10) that really generates a buzz.    7:30 p.m.  7 -- Dinner in Bed    Though it feels like a satire of ''Sex and the City,'' Supperclub San Francisco (657 Harrison Street, 415-348-0900) is actually a branch of a restaurant born in Amsterdam. ''Let's go to bed,'' the host says, whisking you into an all-white room with oversize beds laid out for 175. The prix-fixe menu ($70 on Saturdays) ranges widely, from baby back ribs to four-cheese ravioli with chives and lemon verbena oil. It can take up to three and a half hours to go through five courses. But there's no nodding off. Not with the eclectic artistic presentations, which can be music, film or a fashion show, to entertain you. Imagine a man clad in a diaper, climbing down a stairway while sucking on a pacifier. Those in the mood for a more traditional meal should try Town Hall (342 Howard Street, 415-908-3900), where the well-executed dishes draw on American regional influences and nobody eats lying down. Main courses, in the $20's, change often.    10 p.m.  8 -- Saturday Night Live    In keeping with the recent history of SoMa, Mezzanine (444 Jessie Street, 415-625-8880; www.mezzaninesf.com; admission $15 to $25), a cool live-music venue, occupies a warehouse once inhabited by a dot-com. It caters to all tastes: hip-hop, soul, world beat, jazz. Order a martini at one of the bars and feel as if you're in your own music video. Fatboy Slim, Martin Luther and the National have all played here. But don't expect anything too mainstream. Hootie & the Blowfish would be barred at the door.    Sunday    10 a.m.  9 -- Young Bliss    Bliss San Francisco (181 Third Street, on the fourth floor of the W Hotel, 415-281-0990) casts itself as the young person's spa, soothing but free of self-seriousness. It features rock and jazz, not New Age whale music. Grab a brownie as you await your treatment. The Hangover Herbie ($215) includes a revitalizing face mask and an ''antimigraine'' massage. There's really nothing different about the Manly-Cure ($23) treatment. It's just a more macho way of saying you had your nails done.    12 p.m.  10 -- Dim Summing    Dim sum fiends may debate where to get the best buns in San Francisco. But few would dispute the atmospheric appeal of Yank Sing (1 Rincon Center, 101 Spear Street, 415-957-9300). The restaurant stands in what was once a post office, an Art Deco building with colorful murals in the lobby. Order an imperial walnut salad ($7.30) and steamed pork buns ($3.65) and sip jasmine tea. If the spa didn't relax you, the indoor water shower, which spills gently from the ceiling and splashes in the atrium outside the restaurant, will.    Fish for Baseballs Or for a Good Time       The South of Market district of San Francisco is about a half hour from both San Francisco International Airport and Oakland International Airport. Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, runs from both airports to stops in downtown San Francisco a short walking distance from SoMa. Taxis from either airport cost $30 to $50.      St. Regis Hotel, San Francisco (125 Third Street, 415-284-4000) is a luxurious hotel that takes many of its aesthetic cues from the nearby San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The hotel is home to Ame, one of the city's best new restaurants. The St. Regis's cool, contemporary accommodations include 260 guest rooms, starting at $379.     Beautiful bay views, a luxury spa and a penthouse-level yoga studio are some of the attractions of Hotel Vitale (8 Mission Street, 415-278-3700), on the revitalized Embarcadero waterfront. It has 199 rooms, $279 to $399.     Marriott Courtyard San Francisco Downtown (299 Second Street, 415-947-0700) features comfortable accommodations, combined with a convenient location just blocks from the ballpark and museums.

BEST OF ARLENE GROCERY, Arlene Grocery, 95 Stanton Street, between Ludlow and Orchard, Lower East Side, (212) 358-1633. When Shane Doyle opened this bodega-turned-bar in 1996, he planned on the kind of drop-in environment that had brought real and aspiring stars to the stage at Sine, the St. Marks Place establishment he'd previously owned. He has, but not without controversy. Some local musicians have united against Mr. Doyle's policy of not paying the talent, while others figure the free-admission policy makes for good exposure. Do musicians benefit enough from appearing at this hip bar to forgo their always-small fees? Help in forming a judgment is offered by this show, which features the best unsigned bands (according to Mr. Doyle) that have passed through Arlene Grocery since it opened. Performers tonight include Thrill Cycle, Baby Steps, Cardinal Woolsey, Pets, Life in a Blender and Crown Jewels. Tomorrow, the bill features Hot Water, Succor, Smittys, Episonic, Vaporhead, Talking to Animals, Poolsville, Blue Cowboys, Johnny Chan, Those Bleedin' Tulips, and Poka Poka.

After Paul Burlison dropped his guitar amplifier in the 1950's, he liked the distortion that came out, and he used the biting tone as a member of Johnny Burnette's Rock and Roll Trio in songs like ''Train Kept A-Rollin''' and ''Tear It Up.''

AFRICA FETE, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 72d Street, (212) 360-2777. Small but strong, this year's touring festival of mostly African performers features Baaba Maal, Kulanjan and Oliver Mtukudzi. Mr. Maal is one of Senegal's most powerful singers and band leaders, able to bring audience members to their feet with electric world-embracing Fula pop fusions, to surprise them with a Gershwin song and then silence them with an acoustic traditional Senegalese song. Kulanjan is an Afro-blues collaboration between Taj Mahal and Toumani Diabate, a Malian musician able to make the kora (a 21-stringed lute) fit neatly into any genre of music. And after releasing over 40 albums, the Zimbabwean star Mr. Mtukudzi finally comes to Manhattan for the first time, bringing with him a throaty, resonant voice, a slick appearance and searching political lyrics reminiscent of the great American soul singers of the 60's.

These New York City staples play Celtic-tinged folk-rock with unshakable pop hooks, mixing keyboards and guitars with mandolin and tin whistle. They celebrate drinking, depression and strife like the Pogues do, with jigs thickly coated in black humor. Songs like \\"Shut Up and Drink\\" and \\"Amsterdam Mistress\\" (which rhymes \\"pints of Guinness\\" with \\"lots of slow kisses\\") make for perfect St. Patrick's Day wallowing.

That's a pretty good working definition of the music of Black 47, a proud band of talented New Yorkers who aren't afraid to temper their good-time Celtic rock and rap with lyrics about interracial relationships and Irish martyrs, even if it means resorting to the kind of hackneyed lines that Stevie Hero uses.

In Ireland, a good-time jam session in a pub is known as a craic, and that's just how this concert promises to end. Brian Conway -- a prosecuting attorney by day, a tremendous fiddler by night -- plays in the Sligo style, creating wild, ornate melodies with speed, grace and ease.

The play has only the one character, the poet Emily Dickinson, who conjures up the many people who influenced her life but are never seen onstage. The original production had an extended run on Broadway in 1976 starring Julie Harris and directed by Charles Nelson Reilly. It has since been a popular choice for regional theater nationwide.    The Actors Company is well known for its range of presentations, from Cole Porter to Shakespeare. Tickets for \\"The Belle of Amherst\\" are $10, $8 for people 62 and older and students.

Insisting on only local produce, they harvest no berry before its time. Consequently, the organizers must keep in touch with farms for about six weeks before scheduling the festival.   When the berries are ripe, they corral as many volunteers as possible to pick and clean them in time for the appointed day, which is today. Visitors will have two hours, from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M. to gorge on strawberry shortcake with whipped cream and ice cream, and scoop up pints or quarts of berries to take home.   Deborah Moore, one of the organizers, said, \\"These strawberries, ripened on the vine, are outstanding in flavor and far sweeter than those shipped in from the West.\\"   The festival will be held on the church lawn, 5 Bedford Road at Woodsbridge Road. In case of rain, it will move indoors to the Parish House behind the church on Edgemont Road. Admission is free, and proceeds from sales will aid the Katonah Community Center, which is supported by several civic groups, churches and synagogues. Call 232-4094 for more information.

Cindy Beer, coordinator of the program, will conduct the open-mike segments. Poets wishing to read will be asked to sign in on a first-come-first-served basis. The programs will end about 10:30.   The first featured poet will be Rick Pernod, organizer in 1991 of Exoterica, a weekly poetry series at An Beal Bocht Cafe in Riverdale. Ms. Beer is also affiliated with Exoterica and has been featured at several readings in Manhattan. She is a teacher of poetry at the Fieldston School in the Bronx.

Show times this weekend: 11 A.M., 2, 5:30 and 8:30 P.M. today; 9 A.M., noon, 3, 6 and 9 P.M. tomorrow, and 9 A.M., 3, 6 and 9 P.M. on Sunday. Some performances this weekend are sold out, and others have only scattered seats.  'A Question of Taste' 'The Mighty Casey'  Juilliard Opera Center 155 West 65th Street (212) 874-7515 (212) 874-6770 (Centercharge) Recommended ages: 10 and up Tonight and Sunday    These two one-act operas by William Schuman, written in English, offer an excellent chance to acquaint older children with this musical form.  They are to be presented and sung by Juilliard School students. \\"A Question of Taste,\\" based on the short story \\"Taste\\" from the Roald Dahl book \\"Tales of the Unexpected,\\" is set in 1910 and recounts the tale of a wine-tasting contest between an officious wine connoisseur and a greedy father, who is willing to bet the hand of his daughter. The narrative is not at all complicated and the libretto is by J. D. McClatchy. The set is in the style of a Ralph Lauren advertisement, a show unto itself. \\"The Mighty Casey,\\" based on the Ernest L. Thayer poem \\"Casey at the Bat,\\" is a lively tour de force of baseball at its best, with a riveting narrative, a pulsating chorus of adults and young rascals, some balletic leaps and the almighty Casey as the embodiment of hope and triumph. By witnessing Casey's travails, young baseball fans will see how the great player gracefully accepts disappointment. A narrator keeps the story line clear. Each opera lasts about an hour, with a 15-minute intermission. Tickets are $10; performances are at 8 P.M. today and at 2 P.M. on Sunday. Hanukkah Celebration  Hebrew Arts Center 129 West 67th Street (212) 362-8060 Recommended ages: 3 to 10 Sunday    What better way to celebrate the remaining days of Hanukkah than to attend a children's party at the Hebrew Arts Center in Manhattan, where the focus is on the culture and traditions of Judaism. A short play will be presented at two parties on Sunday. The play, \\"Wish on a Golden Fish,\\" is based on the fable about a fisherman, his wife and three wishes. It will be performed by the Children's Theater Center of New Jersey, which is based in Teaneck. A sing-along of Hanukkah songs is to follow, including the popular dreidel song (\\"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay.\\"). On your way out, don't forget to pick up the bags of chocolate Hanukkah goodies and your very own dreidel to play with at home. The center is indeed child-friendly, with restrooms on every floor; ramps for strollers; elevators, and a lounge to rest in with cranky or tired children, which is near the recital hall where the parties will be held. The shows are at 11:15 A.M. and 1 P.M., and they are an hour and 15 minutes long. Admission: $7 for adults and children. No refreshments are available. Caroling  Central Park Grand Army Plaza (60th Street and Fifth Avenue) (212) 427-4040 Recommended ages: 1 and up Tomorrow    Two amiable Urban Park Rangers will supply the songbooks and you and the children can supply the singing for an afternoon of Christmas carol singing as you stroll through the park. The rangers, ready for any musical disaster, lead the chorus along a secret route, stopping along the way to impart good cheer and a few high notes to parkgoers. To meet up with the rangers at the 2 P.M. starting time, look for two people dressed in gray-and-green uniforms and Smokey Bear hats on the plaza near the Sherman statue. Parents with babies in strollers are more than welcome, and if you and the family tire before you reach the destination, which should take about an hour and a half, you can always leave. No refreshments are served.

Neatly arrayed in chest-high glass cases, these bits and pieces from Charles Dickens's life give children a close-up view of this wildly exuberant man. They can go home and practice signing their names with swirling lines underneath, just like Dickens, who also wrote \\"Believe me,\\" at the end of many letters. The tiny 1843 leather-bound presentation copy of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is as precious as the tale itself. In all, Oliver Twist would have approved. The exhibition's hours are Mondays through Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. There is an elevator if you happen to take younger children in strollers.  Multi-Cultural Programs  Lower East Side Tenement Museum 97 Orchard Street Manhattan (212) 431-0233 Recommended ages: 10 and up  Through January    This small five-year-old museum, devoted to preserving the history of immigrants who lived on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in an 1863 tenement, presents at noon on Sundays \\"Family Matters: An Immigrant Memoir.\\" A narrator offers black-and-white slides to help tell the story of the Scheinbergs, Eastern European Jews who immigrated to the Lower East Side at the turn of the century. At the time, 700 people an acre lived there. The hourlong dramatization, in which the narrator plays a Scheinberg daughter, is anecdotal and informative. And it may make your children grateful for the hot water that runs freely in the baths they never want to take. A second program, \\"Tenements in Focus,\\" at 2 P.M. on Sundays this month (except on Jan. 27), reviews, with a narrator, the conditions of tenement dwellers in the 1930's, as illustrated by the permanent installation of Works Progress Administration photographs by Arnold Eagle. The many shots of proud-looking immigrant children living in squalor show just how determined they must have been to achieve the American dream. Neither program is suitable for toddlers or young children. The museum is open Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 A.M. to 4 P.M., and on Sundays, 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. Admission to \\"Family Matters\\" is $10 for adults, $9 for the elderly and $5 for students (through college)","excerpt":"admission to \\"Tenements,\\" $7 for adults, $6 for the elderly and $5 for students. For $1, one may view the permanent exhibition.  'Narnia'  Fashion Institute of Technology Haft Theater 227 West 27th Street Manhattan (212) 279-4200 Recommended ages: 3 and up Through Jan. 20    With live music, lush costumes and a back-stabbing witch, this C. S. Lewis-based tale of four brothers and sisters who enter the Narnia kingdom, where they encounter evil in its natural state, is bound to elicit at least one round of applause over the course of the two-hour play. For some reason, no one likes Jadis, the white witch; perhaps because she kidnaps and taunts children. But in a world that turns from snow to spring, she can't last in this work performed by the New York State Theater Institute. The play has a 15-minute intermission, in which you and the children can get to the restrooms and water fountains. There are stairs and an escalator to the theater; you may ask for directions at the lobby's information booth. Admission is $12 on weekdays and $15 on Saturdays and Sundays. The play starts at 10:30 A.M. Tuesdays through Fridays, 2 and 8 P.M. on Saturdays and 3 P.M. on Sundays.  New York National Boat Show  Jacob K. Javits Convention Center 11th Avenue, between 34th and 39th Streets Manhattan (212) 216-3416 or 2616 Recommended ages: 3 and up Through Jan. 13    How many boats can be squeezed into a 500,000-square-feet space? Around 1,000. But don't let that trivia overwhelm you. Just picture this: Sitting back with the children on a 42-foot sailboat, with 10 stereo speakers, leather seats, mahogany paneling and a bathtub big enough to swim in, without worrying about seasickness, children overboard or having no wind. Truly, it's harder to tell who has more fun -- parents or children -- climbing in and out of the Baretta racers, Boston Whalers, cabin cruisers, Donzis, yachts and even a boat called Hard Candy, a cigarette boat that flies over the ocean at 90 miles an hour and costs $455,000. Almost as good as President Bush's boat in Maine. Getting to the convention center by public transportation is not overwhelming either. Two bus lines, M42 and M34, have stops at it or close by. The IND subway lines, stopping at 34th or 42d Streets, are within a short walking distance. The show's hours are noon to 9 P.M. today, 10 A.M. to 10 P.M. tomorrow and 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. on Sunday. Admission is $8 for adults and $3 for children. Food stalls (hot dogs, $2; sodas, $1.75) are conveniently located (pick up the official directory at the entrance), as are restrooms and coat checks. Strollers come in handy for going up and down the long aisles.  Open-Play Basketball  Murry Bergtraum High School Gymnasium 411 Pearl Street Manhattan (212) 374-1421 or (212) 228-9656 Recommended ages: 8 to 16 Through April    Anyone who can dribble and shoot and run like heck can come down to the Murry Bergtraum High School gymnasium on Friday nights and play a good game of basketball. The gym attracts a crowd that plays from 6 to 9 P.M. Since this is open play, several teams may be created, taking advantage of all the courts. At least three staff members -- Jerry, Bruce, Jude or Bob -- manage to sweat a little, too. No lockers are available, so wear your sweats or shorts, T-shirts and sneakers straight to the gym. The IRT Lexington Avenue line, stopping at the Brooklyn Bridge, is right around the corner. The school's black three-door entrance, on Pearl Street, is slightly obscured by scaffolding.  The activity is sponsored by the City of New York Youth Bureau and the Parish of Trinity Church.

She made her New York debut in one of the most distinguished cabarets, the Persian Room of the Plaza Hotel, and she received a Grammy nomination for the song that has been identified with her since, \\"It Must Be Him.\\" Now, 25 years later, the Mexican-American singer, whose real name is Florencia Bisenta de Casillas Martinez Cardona, is still drawing Grammy attention -- she won a Grammy this year for the best Latin album -- and has moved to the Blue Note, taking with her the piano accompanist of her early days, Bob Florence, the well-known big-band leader and arranger. Her shows today, tomorrow and Sunday are at 9 and 11:30 P.M. At the tables there are a $25 music charge plus a $5 minimum","excerpt":"admission to the bar is $15. Ellington Fan     Mike LeDonne Trio, the Chestnut Room, Tavern on the Green, Central Park West at 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 873-3200. Although Mike LeDonne, the pianist, is closely associated with swing-era styles through his work with the Widespread Jazz Orchestra, he has a much more specific connection with the music of Duke Ellington. He has described himself as an Ellington fanatic, and with the least excuse -- or no excuse at all -- he will veer into anything Ellingtonian, particularly rarely heard tunes. With John Webber on bass and Kenny Washington at the drums, he mixes his Ellington choices with songs composed by pianists like Hank Jones and Jimmy Rowles or selections to which he was introduced by other pianists like Tommy Flanagan and Barry Harris. The trio plays today and tomorrow from 10 P.M. to 2 A.M. There is a $10 minimum.

The Blue Note's annual monthlong summer mix of Latin music and jazz is now in its third week, with two strong groups pointing up the creative vitality that is surging through Latin jazz. The pianist Eddie Palmieri began his career in the 1950's, a decade after Machito and his Afro-Cubans gave that music its foundation in the United States, and he has been in its vanguard ever since. Hilton Ruiz, also a pianist, was classically trained and was guided into jazz by one of its most thoughtful teachers, Mary Lou Williams. His distinctive playing has been shaped by his classical and jazz studies set against his barrio background. His quintet will feature Daniel Ponce as a special guest on conga.

Accordion Makes Three    Nancy Marano and Eddie Monteiro, Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 758-2272). After building a devoted following during eight years of playing one-night stands in clubs in northern New Jersey, Westchester County and, more recently, New York City, Nancy Marano and Eddie Monteiro have finally achieved an extended engagement at a major club, Michael's Pub. Ms. Marano, a songwriter and arranger, plays piano and sings, while Mr. Monteiro uses a unique accordion that houses a miniaturized organ with synthesizer effects as well as a microphone that projects his vocalizing, with its crisply popped scat syllables and lazy hums. The duo is today's equivalent of innovative jazz vocal groups like the Boswell Sisters in the 1930's and Lambert, Hendricks and Ross in the 1950's. Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 9:15 and 11:15 P.M. There is a $20 cover charge and a $15 minimum.

Jimmy Smith, who gave the Hammond organ validity as a jazz instrument in the late 1950's, is making one of his infrequent visits to New York from his home in California to lead a trio with musicians who are his equals on their own instruments: the guitarist Kenny Burrell and the drummer Grady Tate. They last appeared together at Fat Tuesday's in 1991. Now in his mid-60's, Mr. Smith still plays jazz-funk with an energy that leaves both his audiences and his sidemen exhausted. They go on tonight and tomorrow at 8 and 10 P.M. and midnight, and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a cover charge of $20 and a $10 minimum.
