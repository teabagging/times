He was 77 years old.    Sir Andrzej left a large and varied legacy that included 10 symphonies and many other orchestral works, several concertos, a catalogue of chamber works and a sizable body of choral and vocal music. Many of his works embodied extramusical associations, sometimes naturalistic, sometimes mystical and often political. His \\"Sinfonia Votiva,\\" for example, was a response to the Gdansk shipworkers' strike and the Solidarity movement in Poland in 1980, and he dedicated his 1986 Bassoon Concerto to the memory of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a Roman Catholic priest who was tortured and killed by the Polish secret police. Conservative and Tonal    Sir Andrzej's best music is dark and mysterious in texture and tone, although he composed outgoing and even exuberant music when it suited his purpose. His language was conservative and essentially tonal, with veins of expressive dissonance that give his works a rich emotional resonance. And he preferred to work in structures that were clear and easily grasped, if sometimes unorthodox. His most recent work is a cello concerto, completed two weeks ago. It is to be given its premiere in June 1992 by the London Symphony Orchestra, with Mstislav Rostropovich as the soloist.

Thirteen years ago, Juilliard decided to do something about that and asked aspiring choreographers and composers to create short works together, to be performed at a lunchtime concert, open to all, but mostly attended by students and friends. This year, the school is offering two additional free evening performances, giving a bigger audience the opportunity to find out whether another Stravinsky-Balanchine pairing is in the making. ''Music and dance are created together in every culture except ours,'' said Pia Gilbert, the music division supervisor of the project. ''What the students tend to find out is that we use some of the same means of expression, even if our instruments are quite different.'' The 12 students work together for two weeks -- playing music and dancing for one another -- before pairing off. Then they spend about two months making a six-minute work. ''Six minutes is not an insignificant amount of time for students to get a real sense of how an idea can come to fruition,'' said Elizabeth Keen, the dance division overseer. Laura Careless (above with Andrew Murdock), a third-year dancer who is collaborating with Jonathan Keren, a post-graduate composition student, said: ''To work with a composer so closely has really been eye-opening. If you understand another kind of process, it can help you find ways of working that you wouldn't necessarily find on your own.'' (Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Peter J.

Although the orchestra's specialty, 20th-century American music, is widely considered the province of the new-music fringe, Jesse Rosen, the orchestra's executive director, said that the ensemble's ticket sales had tripled since 1985. And although many organizations have concluded that the prudent thing to do in a recession is cut back on performances, the American Composer's Orchestra is expanding its schedule to five concerts, up from four this season.   The orchestra has also just appointed its first music director, Dennis Russell Davies. Mr. Davies, who is 47 years old, was not a surprise choice. He was one of the orchestra's founders (with the composers Francis Thorne and Nicolas Roussakis and the conductor Paul Lustig Dunkel, all of whom are still involved with the group), and he has been principal conductor since 1977. His new contract begins this season and runs for three years.

Most impressive of the group was the four-movement \\"Dreaming,\\" inspired by a sequence of literary images. Mr. Reynolds, initially known for fearsomely complex technological experimentation, now favors a free-form fantasizing on poetic extracts. The opening two episodes, based on fragments of texts by Borges, release disparate and delicately instrumented night visions, both \\"ecstatic\\" and \\"agitated.\\" Solo voices, carrying fragmentary melodic shapes, poke fitfully through a restless, shifting background.
