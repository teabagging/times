We sat through Buck Jones's \\"Hollywood Round-Up\\" in fairly tolerant mood, accepting it as a slight little spoof of the movie colony, a few notches above the usual horse-opera grade. It seems a genial enough preliminary for the main event, which (we presumed) was \\"Young Dynamite.\\" And then discovered, after ten minutes of \\"Young Dynamite,\\" that it was the preliminary. We still feel, where pictures are concerned, that one's company and two's a crowd.At the Modern PlayhouseMargit Dayka, a blonde Hungarian actress who made a hit on the Yorkville screen five years ago in \\"Piri Knows Everything,\\" is back in \\"Toroekoi Menyasszony\\" (The Toroekoi Bride), the latest importation at the little Modern Playhouse. She is again paired with the handsome Paul Javor and, following the usual tricks of fate, they are the leading figures at a village wedding dance which is about the most interesting feature of this far from exciting film.A poor orphan girl, beloved by the \\"catch\\" of the village of Torockoi, is rejected by him when he hears that she is of Jewish origin. His love overcomes this obstacle, however, and he goes to the town where she has been taken by her supposed step mother (Szerena Szujkau) and urges her to flee with him to parts unknown. She refuses, but the arrival of word to the effect that Margit is not Jewish after all solves the whole problem. Gyula Kabos is as funny as ever as a village inn-keeper. The picture is an Erno Gaal production directed by Marton Keleti.At the 86th St. Garden TheatreLiving up to its name, \\"Gewitter im Mai,\\" the new UFA film at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre begins with a storm on the ocean and ends with one in the Bavarian mountains. Between these outbursts of nature there are a few mental tempests due to the jealousy provoked in the heart of a prosperous blacksmith (Ludwig Schmid-Wildy) when he realizes that the return from the sea of his boyhood friend (Viktor Staal) means the end of his hope to marry the village belle—no less a beauty than Hansi Knoteck.But there are no real villains in this pictorially striking piece, so when Viktor's life is imperilled in scaling a peak to prove that he is still a mountaineer, it is his rival who leads the rescue party. Lovely views, good acting, plenty of lively Bavarian dialogue and excellent photography combine to make \\"Storms in May\\" worth seeing. Herr Schmid-Wildy and a wholesome, buxom lass named Anny Seitz are welcome newcomers to the Yorkville screen. Hans Deppe directed the picture.At the 86th Street CasinoWhile the subject matter of \\"Ball im Metropol,\\" the current visitor on the screen of the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre, is far from original, excellent acting by a competent cast, headed by the veteran Heinrich George, and some nice city and country scenes in the Germany of about 1900 combine to make it fairly interesting.The appealing blond Hilde Weissner suffers in real Ann Harding style through the greater part of the picture. Naturally, she is rewarded for her self-sacrificing devotion to an honest young nobleman (Heinz von Cleve) whom she has saved from possible death at the hands of the over-jealous husband (Franz Schafheitlin). Outstanding is the work of Herr George as the youth's uncle who smooths the path of true love in the end.The action is explained by English titles. Frank Wysbar directed the film for the Terra company.

A3    Arafat Leaves Washington  Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, left Washington considering new American compromises but rejecting as ''peanuts'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's offer of a limited Israeli redeployment from less than 10 percent of the West Bank.
