Had raised about $5.4 million as of Oct. 15 and will spend all that and more. ALFONSE M. D'AMATO, 55. Lawyer, United States Senator since 1981. Presiding Supervisor, Town of Hempstead, L.I., 1977-80","excerpt":"Supervisor, 1971-77; Receiver of Taxes, 1969-71. First office, Nassau County Public Administrator, 1965. Had raised $9.4 million as of Oct. 15 and will spend it all. The Issues   The candidates have sharp differences on almost every important topic. Mr. D'Amato opposes abortion; Mr. Abrams is a longtime supporter of abortion rights. Mr. D'Amato supports the death penalty; Mr. Abrams opposes it. Mr. Abrams wants to cut $280 billion from the military budget over the next five years; Mr. D'Amato wants to cut $80 billion. Mr. D'Amato opposes national health insurance or any higher taxes; Mr. Abrams favors ending all private health insurance in favor of a Government plan backed by higher payroll and corporate taxes, and higher taxes on liquor and cigarettes. Analysis:   Recent statewide polls have shown Mr. Abrams holding an edge, with a lead ranging from 3 to 11 points. But one-quarter or more of voters were undecided as of last week, so the race remains volatile. Mr. Abrams, a popular vote getter for years, should have a strong natural advantage, since registered Democrats outnumber Republicans about 3 to 2 in the state, Bill Clinton has a double-digit lead over President Bush and Mr. D'Amato's reputation has been tarnished by years of official inquiries into his ethical conduct in office. But Mr. D'Amato has shrewdly promoted his reputation as a \\"Senator Pothole\\" who gets things done, a rancorous Democratic primary left Mr. Abrams wounded and struggling to raise money and polls show much of the public unhappy with both candidates.  U.S. House of Representatives 3d DISTRICT: NASSAU COUNTY The Candidates PETER KING, 48, Republican. Served as Hempstead Councilman from 1978 to 1981 and has been Nassau County Comptroller since then. The public has long identified him as an opponent of abortion. He has taken part in demonstrations against abortion organized by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre.  STEPHEN A. ORLINS, 42, Democrat. A newcomer to the district making his first run for public office. He has spent the last two decades building a brokerage business, which he sold to Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in 1985. He is now a consultant to American Express. The District   The redrawn District has a population of 580,337, 91.7 percent white, with 150,000 registered Republicans, 87,000 Democrats 60,000 independents and a small percentage of voters divided between the Right to Life and Liberal parties. It stretches along the South Shore from East Rockaway through Long Beach, Merrick, Bellmore, Seaford, Massapequa, Farmingdale, Hicksville and north through Locust Valley, Brookville, Glen Cove and Glenwood Landing on the North Shore.  The Issues   Mr. Orlins, who strongly supports a woman's right to abortion, describes Mr. King as a zealot and extreme opponent of abortion. Mr. King describes Mr. Orlins as a carpetbagger who has lived in Manhattan for the last several years and rented a house in Manhasset this summer to run for Congress. Mr. Orlins says he grew up in the district and had his basic values formed there. Both candidates insist that the economy is the major issue. Mr. King says he blew the whistle on Nassau County's fiscal crisis. Mr. Orlins says Mr. King, as Comptroller, was part of the fiscal problem rather than part of the solution. Analysis   While Republicans have held the district for the last 20 years with the repeated election of Representative Norman Lent, who decided not run again this year, the Democrats, riding a wave of anti-incumbency sentiment, have a strong chance. Although it is Mr. King's first race for Congress, he is seen by many voters in the district as part of the Republican establishment that has governed the county for several decades. Two other candidates are in the race and are expected to draw about equal votes from Mr. King and Mr. Orlins. Louis P. Roccanova, 27, is running on the Right to Life ticket, while Ben-Zion J. Heyman, 59, is on the Liberal Party line.  4TH DISTRICT: NASSAU COUNTY The Candidates DAVID A. LEVY, 38, Republican. A lawyer and former radio reporter, he is a member of the Hempstead Town Board and is also a staff political strategist and spokesman for the Nassau County Republican Committee.  PHIL SCHILIRO, 36, Democrat. A lawyer, he has spent more than 10 years in Washington as a staff aide to Democratic members of Congress. He is on leave from his job as chief aide to Representative Henry Waxman, a California Democrat and chairman of the House Health and Environment Subcommittee. The District   The Fourth District was enlarged earlier this year to include most of what had been the Fifth Congressional District, and Raymond J. McGrath, a Republican who had represented the Fifth District for five terms, decided not to seek re-election in the new district.   The Fourth District covers roughly the southwestern two-thirds of Nassau County. Nearly 76 percent of its 580,338 residents are white, 14.3 percent are black and 7 percent are Hispanic. The district is wealthy, with a median household income of $52,000, compared with $32,965 for New York State. Registered Republicans outnumber Democrats, 147,000 to 87,000, with 52,000 Independents. The Issues   Both candidates' positions conform roughly to those of their parties but reflect the moderate views on some social issues of a wealthy, well-educated and religiously diverse constituency. Mr. Levy, who opposes the use of Federal Medicaid funds for abortion, nonetheless rejects the official Republican Party position and supports a woman's right to an abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy. Mr. Schiliro describes himself as ardently \\"pro-choice,\\" supports the use of Medicaid funds for abortion and is seeking to appeal to women by offering greater Federal involvement to combat the high incidence of breast cancer on Long Island. On economic issues, Mr. Levy favors a cut in capital-gains taxes and an income-tax credit for first-time home buyers. Mr. Schiliro supports more Federal funds for rebuilding the nation's infrastructure and for education.  Analysis:   No polls have been taken, but the race appears close. Both candidates are seeking national office for the first time, and voters must decide between professional politicians with sharply different backgrounds. Mr. Levy brings strong support from within the Nassau County Republican organization and years of experience dealing directly with voters in the Town of Hempstead. But his allegiance to the county's Republican establishment is criticized by many here -- including Mr. Schiliro -- who say Nassau has been dominated and hurt by its Republican machine.   Mr. Schiliro brings a decade of experience in Congress, where he has analyzed national policy on health and the environment. His campaign has raised much more money than Mr. Levy's, much of it from political-action committees outside Nassau. But Mr. Schiliro may be vulnerable because he has spent all of his adult life outside the district he hopes to represent, residing mainly in Washington and its suburbs, and returned to his family's home in Baldwin only last spring, when his campaign began. 13TH DISTRICT: BROOKLYN, STATEN ISLAND The Candidates SAL F. ALBANESE, 43, Democrat. City Councilman since 1982 representing a Brooklyn district that covers some of the most conservative neighborhoods in the city, including Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights and Bay Ridge, where he lives. Former public-school teacher whose family immigrated to Brooklyn from Italy when he was a child. SUSAN MOLINARI, 34, REPUBLICAN. Former City Councilwoman and third generation of a well-known Staten Island political family. In 1990 she was elected to the seat that had been held by her father, Guy V. Molinari, now Staten Island Borough President. Known for her support of abortion rights. Lives in New Dorp, Staten Island. The District    The redrawn 13th District covers all of Staten Island and then zig-zags through southwest Brooklyn. The population is mostly white and nearly 1 in 3 voters are Republicans, making this district one of the most conservative in the city. Two-thirds of the electorate live in Staten Island, the rest in the mostly Italian, Irish and Greek neighborhoods of Brooklyn, including Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Fort Hamilton and Dyker Heights. The Issues    The candidates differ on who would best address voters' concerns about reducing the $5 toll on cars crossing the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge from Brooklyn to Staten Island, the Fresh Kills landfill, health care and the environment. They both support a woman's right to an abortion. Analysis    Ms. Molinari's Staten Island roots and her name recognition have afforded her the clear advantage in this race. But her strong ties to the Bush Administration and her status as an incumbent may pose problems. She faces stiff competition from Mr. Albanese, who has based his campaign on his record as a maverick on the City Council and his reputation for strong constituent service.    A third-party candidate, Kathleen Murphy, 53, a lawyer running on the Right to Life line, describes herself as the \\"only true conservative\\" in the race and is expected to draw some voters from Ms. Molinari.    14TH DISTRICT: MANHATTAN, BROOKLYN, QUEENS The Candidates  CAROLYN MALONEY, 44, Democrat. Worked as a public-school teacher, an administrator for the City Board of Education and an aide in the State Assembly and the State Senate before being elected to the City Council in 1982. Has served as chairwoman of the Contracts Committee for the last year.  BILL GREEN, 63, Republican. Former administrator of Region 2 of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development before being elected to the House of Representatives in 1978. Serves on the House Appropriations Committee and is one of the wealthiest members of the House.  The District   District 14 is known as the Silk Stocking District because it comprises some of the richest areas in Manhattan. It takes in a good chunk of the East Side, stretching from Grand Street north to 106th Street and also zigzags into the West Side.  The lines were redrawn this year so that the district now includes the West Side from 89th to 103d Streets; Greenpoint, Brooklyn; Astoria, Queens, and Roosevelt Island. These areas tend to be heavily Democratic, and Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district 3 to 1.  The Issues   Mr. Green has a well-established reputation as a progressive Republican in the Jacob Javits mold, a persona perfectly suited to this area of monied Democrats, and in Congress he has tended to vote against the Administration more often than not. He and Ms. Maloney agree on most social issues, including abortion -- both support a woman's right to choose -- and gay rights, and both describe themselves as champions of the environment. Mr. Green disparages the City Council's work, saying that the Council has not been particularly effective, while Ms. Maloney has sought to cast her opponent as a big-spending tool of special interests who has sided with the Administration on economic matters harmful to the city.  Analysis   Mr. Green is extraordinarily popular in the district and has staved off heavyweight challenges in the past from the likes of Bella Abzug, Andrew J. Stein and Carter Burden. He is also outspending Ms. Maloney more than 3 to 1 in this race. But he faces several problems this year: a possible landslide by Gov. Bill Clinton in the district; Ms. Maloney's anti-incumbency, year-of-the-woman campaign, and new district lines that have added heavily Democratic neighborhoods, where Mr. Green has little name recognition, to the district.  18TH DISTRICT: WESTCHESTER COUNTY, BRONX, QUEENS The Candidates NITA M. LOWEY, 55, Democrat. A volunteer community advocate in such organizations as the Parent-Teacher Association until 1975, when she became an official of the New York State Department of State. Served as the state's Assistant Secretary of State from 1985 to 1987. First elected to Congress in 1988 when she unseated her current opponent, Joseph J. DioGuardi, a conservative Republican who served two terms in Congress, winning election in 1984 and 1986. JOSEPH J. DIOGUARDI, 52, a certified public accountant and a former partner of Arthur Andersen and Company. Served two terms in Congress. Besides the Republican line, Mr. DioGuardi has the Conservative and Right to Life designations. The District   Snaking through central Queens, parts of the Bronx and southern Westchester County, 43 percent of the voters in the 18th Congressional District are registered as Democrats and 32 percent as Republicans. The Issues   The race, a classic battle between a liberal Democrat and a conservative Republican, has been portrayed by some as one of the sharpest ideological conflicts anywhere in the country this year.   Mrs. Lowey has described her opponent as a \\"far-right, radical, former failed member of Congress\\" and said that his stance against abortion made abortion rights \\"a defining issue\\" in the race.   Mr. DioGuardi portrayed Mrs. Lowey as a \\"100 percent certified public liberal,\\" who has been anti-business and weak in her support of Israel. Analysis   In the final days, the campaign, which had been marked throughout by harsh attacks by both candidates, became extremely bitter with each side accusing the other of ethics and campaign-finance violations. Although Mr. DioGuardi has said he doesn't expect Mrs. Lowey to benefit from the Democrats' enrollment edge, new lines for the district have brought in areas of the Bronx and Queens that traditionally have heavy Democratic turnouts. New York State Senate   The elections for the 61 seats in the New York State Senate, where Republicans have been in the majority for the last 27 years, are marked by two overarching questions: Will the Democrats pick up the five seats they need to take control of the chamber? And even if they fail, will Ralph J. Marino, the majority leader and most powerful Republican in state government, be returning to Albany?   The odds would appear to favor the Republicans in each case, in part because they controlled the Senate redistricting this year and in part because the G.O.P. is way ahead in fund raising for the Senate races. But in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 3 to 2 and where the Presidential ticket may draw a huge Democratic turnout, the sheer force of numbers could yield some upsets.   Mr. Marino is locked in a tough race in his Nassau-Suffolk district with James F. Gaughran, a Democrat whose campaign has been aided by a fierce anti-Marino advertising blitz by a conservative anti-tax group. Mr. Marino has poured money and campaign workers into the race, and his party holds a clear edge in registration in the district. But the race is still considered up in the air, in part because a large turnout for the Clinton-Gore ticket could give Mr. Gaughran a major boost.   Another race that could be especially close is in Queens, where redistricting has pitted two popular incumbents, Jeremy S. Weinstein, a Democrat, and Frank Padavan, a Republican, against each other, .   The Democrats are concentrating on several other districts where they say their challengers have a real shot at unseating Republican incumbents. Among the major challenges to Republican incumbents in the metropolitan region are:   -- District 6, Nassau County, where the incumbent, Kemp Hannon, is running against Barbara I. Amster, the Democratic challenger, a college professor.   -- District 7, Nassau County, where Senator Michael J. Tully Jr., faces Michael J. Siris, a lawyer.   -- District 38, Rockland and Orange counties, where Senator Joseph R. Holland is running against Diana Hess, a former utility executive. The Ballot Question Proposal 1: The Jobs for the New New York Bond Act    Voters in New York State will be asked whether they want to support the proposed jobs bond act, under which the state would borrow $800 million to invest in infrastructure projects like roads and sewer hookups, to create jobs and to attract businesses to the state.  Analysis   Gov. Mario M. Cuomo says the proposal would create more than 35,000 immediate jobs, mostly in construction, and result in 122,000 permanent ones when businesses were attracted to the state. His administration has released a list of more than 350 projects around the state that would be eligible for funding if the bond act passed.    Opponents of the plan say that with the state already carrying $24 billion in tax-supported debt, it can ill afford to take on $1.7 billion more (the cost of the bond issue plus interest). And they question its usefulness in creating long-term jobs.

The over-25 crowd has all but abandoned those warehouses with decibel ranges approximating Boeing-jet test laboratories. Instead, they seek venues offering more intimacy, more style and, above all, comfort. This new genre of club-restaurants -- updated versions of the supper clubs of the 30's and 40's -- is taking root in such citiesas New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington.   Among the first of these clubs were Nell's and MK in Manhattan, which opened in 1986 and 1987, respectively. Both have cushy lounges with parlorlike atmospheres on one floor, and dancing on another. Their success has spawned, in New York, Au Bar, The Living Room, Delia's and, most recently, The Grolier Club. In these and others, cocktails and dinner can precede dancing or live music.

This setbound omnibus drama, produced by Mr. Lynch and featuring three weak episodes set in the New York City hotel room of the title, plays like a listless visit to a Lynch-style \\"Twilight Zone\\" where stories go nowhere, anecdotes are pointlessly bizarre and lame quips are echoed emptily, as if banality were a form of wit.   Not even the lateness of the hour (\\"Hotel Room\\" was first shown on Friday at 11 P.M. and will be rebroadcast tonight at midnight) shows these three vignettes off to good advantage. But \\"Getting Rid of Robert,\\" the one written by Jay McInerney and directed by James Signorelli, at least has the advantage of being cheerful and reasonably murk-free. Like the two other episodes, which Mr. Lynch directed, it is set in Room 603, a drab set that has been none-too-vigorously redecorated to suit each different time period. (The three segments take place in 1969, 1992 and 1936, in that order.) The cleverest conceit of \\"Hotel Room\\" is to use the same young actors (Clark Heathcliffe Brolly and Camilla Overbye Roos) to play bellboy and maid, no matter what the year.

Such a notion might seem far-fetched in a business where it has long been immensely profitable to do just what the other guy is doing.  But in an era of rising program costs and increasing competition from cable and other new technologies, does business as usual make sense?  What if your network's spinoffs, rip-offs and remakes, soap operas and situation comedies have simply stopped commanding a competitive share of the mass audience?   That, to put it bluntly, is the dismal situation at NBC. While ABC earned profits exceeding $210 million for 1981 and CBS some $160 million, NBC earned no profit at all, despite revenues in excess of $1.4 billion. NBC continues to run a distant third in both the daytime and prime-time ratings, with no signs of a turnaround.   But suppose that NBC decided to get out of the traditional network business of providing lowest common denominator entertainment and seized the initiative in the more specialized and faster growing area of news and information.

For one thing, its incidents and its interpretation of the character of the famous beauty of the First Empire are drawn from the biography written by M. Edouard Herriot, the present Minister of Education, a fact which gives it almost an official parentage.The subject itself is conspicuously suitable for dramatic treatment. Madame Récamier lived through the most moving period of French history. Married at the age of 15, during the Terror, she knew most of the brilliant and tragic figures which passed across the stage of history during the Directoire and the Empire. In one aspect, therefore, the film is a remarkable gallery of portraits. We see Napoleon, Josephine, all the Bonapartes, Fouche, the great Generals from Junot to Bernadotte, Madame de Staël, David the painter, Talma the actor, and we even get a glimpse of the young Victor Hugo. Madame Récamier's own life story is full of dramatic incidents, and tragic lights fall at every stage on this coquette whose beauty brought half the men she knew to her feet.With Napoleon.Madame Récamier first is shown as an old woman, still surrounded by admirers and attractive enough to receive an offer of marriage from Chateaubriand. To this little scene we owe an impersonation of Chateaubriand by M. Le Bargy, of the Comédie Française. It is while Madame Récamier is considering the proposal that we are taken through the history of her life. A marriage which was no marriage and for good reasons never could be one","excerpt":"supreme beauty; an incorrigible desire to please—here were perfect qualifications for the career of a coquette. We are shown scenes of flirtation with various distinguished persons, including Lucien Bonaparte, whose love-making approached violence. Even Napoleon himself pursued her with attentions.The most dramatic part of the film is that which displays her conflict with Napoleon. She successfully appeals for the great man's favor for her father. Through a series of scenes at court receptions, at the Théâtre Français, in Napoleon's study, she is shown rejecting his advances. Twice she was pressed to become one of the Empress's ladies. In revenge for her refusal Napoleon declined to save her husband from ruin. Then came comparative poverty. In the refuge of Madame de Staël's house occurred the one idyl in the coquette's career, the love of Prince \\"Augustus of Prussia, \\"the one man who had made her heart beat.\\" But an appeal from her husband brought her back to Paris. She remained Madame Récamier to the end, and the last picture shows her, pathetically aged, writing to Chateaubriand her refusal to change that name. The film is produced under the auspices of Franco-Films, and Mme. Marie Bell takes the leading part.A Melodrama.\\"Une Java,\\" produced by the Omnium Français du Film, has a good though slight story and plenty of movement. It begins with a picture of a sordid dancing room in a suburb of Paris, the recort of low criminals. Mony Arté, a dancer in a revue, stranded in the neighborhood on a stormy night owing to an automobile break-down, takes shelter there, along with her manager and a clown belonging to her company. In the midst of the bustling activity of the unsavory place one sees the approach of danger; a thief has his eyes on Mony Arté's pearls. She is saved from the menace of attack by the watchfulness and prompt action of a handsome young fellow who happens to be in the room. This unexpected protector persuades the great artist to dance with him. Even in such surroundings her art triumphs. Envy and hostility turn to admiration and everybody applauds. Then occurs a police raid, and it is quickly apparent that the handsome dancing partner of the evening, who looks more like a victim of misfortune than a villain, nevertheless has reason for fearing an encounter with the representatives of the law. Mony Arté in her turn becomes a protectress. She passes him off as a member of her company.This romantic episode leaves a deep impression on Mony Arté's mind, and for her next revue she composes a scene inspired by it. On the first night this number scores a great success. Full of thoughts of the original hero, the girl discovers that he is in the hall among the audience. She sends for him. In her dressing room he tells his pathetic story. Months before, as a result of an entanglement with a woman, he had lost his situation and fallen into misery. One night he interfered in a street fight to defend a detective who was being badly handled by two rascals. A shot was fired. The detective was seriously wounded. The two criminals made off and Charvel, innocent, was arrested, tried and sent to prison as the man who fired the shot. Since his release he had lived deliberately in the haunts of vice in the hope that he might meet the real criminal and make the truth known. Mony Arté is deeply affected by this story and invites the young man to go to her house after the theatre in order to discuss his plans for the future.The Villain Captured.The climax of the film is reached by a number of coincidences. First, the detective, Grainger, who has also attended the performance, follows Charvel to the artist's home. Secondly, a group of thieves choose the same night to attempt a burglary at the house. The end may be guessed. The thieves are caught. One of them turns out to be the man who had committed the crime for which Charvel had been punished. Grainger undertakes to have Charvel's innocence recognized by law, so all ends well.
