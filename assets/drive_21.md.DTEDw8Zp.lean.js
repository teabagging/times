Medical employment grew last year by 7.7 percent, the biggest increase in two decades and the biggest rise for any major category of employment tabulated by the Government. All signs point to further growth even though the nation is in what many economists believe is a mild recession, with the overall jobless rate at the highest level in more than three years.   New technology, the increasing number of elderly people, the AIDS epidemic and the increase in health-care spending contributed to the growth of employment in health services. The number of jobs in the industry rose 600,600 last year, to 8.4 million. Fast-Growing Occupations     The number of health-care workers grew more than 50 percent in the 1980's, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that 7 of the 10 fastest growing occupations in the 1990's will be in health care.   Those occupations include physician assistants, home health aides, X-ray technologists, medical secretaries, physical therapists and surgical technicians.   Some experts express concern about the trend and its effect on health care costs, while acknowledging that there seems to be an insatiable demand for health care.    \\"Productivity in the hospital industry declined in the 1980's,\\" said Prof. Gerard F. Anderson, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at Johns Hopkins University. \\"There were more employees in the hospital industry in 1990 than in 1980, and yet the industry produced about the same amount of care as in 1980.\\"   Personnel costs generally account for 70 percent to 80 percent of all health-care spending, Professor Anderson said. Steady Increase     Health-care employment grew 5.2 percent in 1988 and 6.7 percent in 1989. The rate of increase has steadily risen over the last six years.   In monthly reports since June, the Labor Department has reported that hundreds of thousands of workers are losing jobs in factories, auto plants, the construction industry, retail stores, banks and the real estate industry. Buried in those reports, there is often a statement to the effect that the health-care industry \\"continued its pattern of strong growth,\\" adding an average of 50,000 jobs a month.   With Federal, state and local governments and private insurers paying nearly 75 percent of the $585 billion spent on personal health care last year, doctors and hospitals were insulated from some of the economic pressures that forced other employers to lay off workers. But many hospital executives say their net revenue and profit margins declined substantially in recent years as the Federal Government and private insurers began to limit reimbursement.   The number of workers providing home health care rose 19 percent last year, to 315,000, the Labor Department said. At the same time, it said, employment in doctors' offices went up 10 percent, to 1.5 million","excerpt":"7 percent in nursing homes, to 1.5 million, and 6 percent in hospitals, to 3.8 million.   \\"You hear about cutbacks in the health-care industry, but employment continues to grow pell-mell,\\" said Lawrence H. Leith, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Two Sides of a Coin     Prof. Eli Ginzberg, an economist at Columbia University who has been studying health care personnel for 50 years, said the trend should not come as a surprise. \\"As long as the dollars spent on health care keep increasing, employment will continue to grow,\\" he said. \\"The two things are opposite sides of the same coin.\\"   Professor Ginzberg added: \\"In the health-care industry, you have a financial system different from any other part of the American economy. In the private sector, the number of people you can hire is normally determined by a budget or by market forces. But it doesn't work that way in the health-care industry because financing is virtually open-ended.\\"   In other industries, technology often displaces or replaces workers. But new health-care technology has increased the demand for highly trained technicians and technologists to operate the equipment.    \\"New technologies are the most important factor boosting the demand for health services,\\" said Valerie A. Personick, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \\"Because of advances, patients are likely to undergo more tests and diagnostic procedures, take more drugs, see more specialists and be subjected to more aggressive treatments than before.\\"   Connie R. Curran, a registered nurse and consultant to many hospitals, said: \\"Technology is going wild. It's driving the demand for nurses and other health-care workers. As technology becomes more sophisticated, we can take care of patients who are more severely ill and they need more care than ever before. The nurse is caring for a much sicker patient and is also caring for the machine.\\" New Job Needs     Sharon Flynn Hollander, director of nursing at the 660-bed Stanford University Hospital in California, cited pediatric heart surgery in illustrating how new technology increases demand for nurses.   In a procedure used on critically ill infants, blood is drained out of a baby's body so that it bypasses the heart and lungs. The blood absorbs oxygen in an artificial lung and is then pumped back into the baby's blood vessels.    Typically, the use of this technique requires two nurses, one to watch the baby and one to monitor the equipment for several days after surgery.   The aging of the population has also increased demand for health-care workers. The Census Bureau estimates that in the year 2000 there will be 4.6 million Americans 85 years old or older, double the number in 1980.   The increase in the number of elderly people has in turn raised the demand for health care services in the home.  Rise in Registered Nurses     The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the number of registered nurses will increase 39 percent, to 2.2 million, in the year 2000.   Many nursing homes now provide specialized care to people with severe head injuries, to stroke victims and to patients who need the help of a mechanical respirator to breath. But to care for such patients, the nursing homes need physical therapists and respiratory therapists, and those are two of the fastest growing occupations.   The bureau estimates that the number of physical therapists will increase 57 percent, to 107,000, in the year 2000, while the number of respiratory therapists will rise 41 percent, to 79,000.

John Birkofer was appointed to the Board of Trustees of Saint Vincents Hospital in 1976 and elected Chairman six years later. During his 10 years as Chairman, Mr. Birkofer gave unstintingly of his time and talents. He guided the Medical Center through a challenging period in its history and in the process created a stronger and more viable institution. He reconstructed the Board of Trustees to enable it to function more productively, and led a $50 million capital campaign that not only helped finance a facilities modernization project, but provided Saint Vincents with a substantial endowment. He confronted the challenges posed by the environment of scarce resources, restrictive regulations and changing reimbursement mechanisms, with a plan that applied sound business practices that perpetuated Saint Vincents' mission and tradition of excellence. He served Saint Vincents with remarkable vision, leadership and professional expertise, setting high standards for institutional management without compromising the spirit of compassion that is at the heart of Saint Vincents' mission. Mr. Birkofer's volunteer achievements won him national recognition. From 1986 to 1989, he served on the Board of the Catholic Health Association, and in 1987, he was named Trustee of the Year by Modern Healthcare Magazine.

Ethnic Thai migrating south from China after about A.D. 1000 created a number of petty states in the region, most notably the kingdom of Sukhothai. These came under the influence of Indian civilization from the adjacent states of Burma and the Khmer empire, and Buddhism became established as the dominant religion of the Thai. A unified kingdom of Siam was established c. 1350, with its capital at Ayutthaya. Portuguese and other European traders and missionaries were active in Siam after 1511. In 1767 Ayutthaya was destroyed in a war with Burma. In 1782 the Chakkri dynasty was established at Bangkok and restored the power of the Thai monarchy. By skillfully playing off the European powers against one another, Kings Mongkut (r. 1851–68) and Chulalongkorn (r. 1868–1910) enabled Siam to be the only Southeast Asian nation to escape European colonization or political domination. In a series of treaties with Great Britain and France, however, King Chulalongkorn was forced to renounce Siam's claims to portions of Malaya, Laos, and Cambodia. Absolute monarchy ended in 1932, when a military coup forced the granting of a constitution. Japanese troops occupied Siam in Dec. 1941. Siam concluded a nominal alliance with Japan in 1942 and declared war on Great Britain and the U.S, while the monarchy secretly supported a strong anti-Japanese resistance movement. A period of postwar political turmoil ended with the accession in 1950 of King Phumiphon, who instituted a reformist and pro-Western policy. Thai politics since World War II have been democratic but dominated by an oligarchy of military officers and civilians with strong military ties. During the Vietnam War, Thailand was an important staging area for American forces. Since then, U.S. and other foreign investment contributed to significant industrialization and economic growth, making Thailand one of Asia's fastest-growing economies. Its prosperity has attracted a large number of refugees from Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. On Dec. 8, 1990, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan resigned amid charges of corruption. Reappointed by the king the next day, Chatichai was overthrown on Feb. 23 by military forces, who invited former diplomat Anand Panyarachun to serve as interim prime minister. After parliamentary elections in March 1992, Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon, who held no parliamentary seat, was named prime minister in a government dominated by the military. Mass demonstrations against the Suchinda government, led by former Bangkok governor Chamlong Srimuang, culminated on May 17–18, when troops fired on demonstrators, causing hundreds of fatalities. The king intervened and Suchinda resigned. Chamlong agreed to call off the demonstrations and Anand Panyarachun was invited to head another transitional government, and Parliament agreed in principle to a new constitution with a provision that the prime minister must be an elected member of Parliament. Parliamentary elections in 1992 gained a majority for a five-party coalition headed by Chuan Leekpai that managed to govern for almost three years, liberalizing financial arrangements, spending heavily on infrastructure, and bringing Thailand to an 8 percent growth rate in 1994. In elections held in 1995, the Thai Nation party captured the largest number of seats; its leader, Banharn Silpa-Archa, became prime minister but the party lost the 1996 elections and a coalition government led by General Chavalit took over. Only six months later the Thai economy began a steep decline and the currency was devalued in June 1997. The U.S. and the I.M.F. agreed to provide loans of $4 bil. to stabalize the economy with more promised if the government took appropriate action. Chuan Leekpai returned as prime minister in Nov. 1997 but economic recovery was only slowly under way by mid-1998. Still the government survived a Dec. 1999 no confidence vote just before the Bank of Thailand announced a 4 percent rise in G.D.P. for the year. Elections in Jan. 2001 brought a near majority to the Thai Rak Thai party of computer and telecommunications billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, who was named prime minister but who faced serious legal charges of tax evasion. The Constitutional Court acquitted Thaksin by a vote of 8–7 and with no written opinion issued. Thailand"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: western Africa.

In the 13th century, the Akan around the city of Kumasi were trading gold and other commodities with the Mande to the north. The number of competing states in the region grew rapidly after European contact. The Asante empire began in the early 17th century under Osei Tutu. By 1750 it controlled the northern part of Ghana, and by 1820 it had brought the coastal Fante empire, with its access to the European trade, under its control. The Portuguese first explored the area, on Africa's west coast, in 1471, naming it the Gold Coast because of its gold deposits and its reserves of “black gold”—slaves. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the British, Danes, and Dutch established slave trading posts there, which is where most American slaves came from. The slave trade ended in the 1850's, and the British gained control of the Gold Coast, making it a protectorate in 1871 and a colony in 1886. Great Britain gave the colony a new constitution in 1946 under which Africans held a majority of seats in the legislature. Kwame Nkrumah became prime minister of the colony in 1952 and the first prime minister of the nation when it became independent in 1960. At independence, Ghana boasted Africa's largest man-made deep-water port and the most productive gold mine in the world, and it was the second largest producer of industrial diamonds. Nkrumah began to court Communist bloc nations and exert absolute authority. In January 1964 all opposition parties were outlawed. A military council seized power in February 1966 and ousted Nkrumah. Civilian governments ran the country briefly, but in 1981, Flt. Lt. Jerry Rawlings took power in a coup and ruled until 2000. Ghana suffered severe economic problems throughout the 1970's and 1980's, and many of Ghana's people left for Nigeria to find work. In 1983 Nigeria returned more than one million of these migrant workers, increasing Ghana's economic woes. After five years of stagnation, Ghana achieved a 6 percent economic growth rate in 1989 under a World Bank restructuring program. But political unrest remained. A new constitution was approved in an April 1992 referendum, and in November Rawlings received 58 percent of the vote. His National Democratic Congress all but swept the legislative elections due to an opposition boycott. Under the constitution, Rawlings was not permitted to run for a third term and in Dec. 2000 John Kufuor of the opposition New Patriotic Party won the presidency in a run-off election.

The precolonial East Indies consisted of several Islamic and Hindu kingdoms in the western islands and tribal societies in the easterly ones. The Portuguese established trading posts in the 16th century; by the 17th century, control had largely passed to the Dutch East India Company. With the company's bankruptcy in 1799, the Dutch established direct colonial rule. Several 19th-century anticolonial uprisings, though costly to the Dutch, failed to dislodge them. Nationalist sentiment grew in the early 20th century, organized around Islamic groups, the Indonesian Communist party (PKI, founded 1920), and the Indonesian Nationalist party (PNI, founded 1927). Sukarno, founder of the PNI, achieved prominence as a nationalist leader and was jailed by the Dutch. The Dutch East Indies fell quickly to the Japanese early in 1942. Some nationalists at first hailed the Japanese as liberators but quickly turned against their harsh occupation. On Aug. 17, 1945, Sukarno proclaimed Indonesia's independence. With British aid, the Dutch returned and tried to reestablish colonial rule; in 1949, threatened with a cutoff of American Marshall Plan aid, they withdrew and acknowledged Indonesia's independent status. Under Sukarno Indonesia took a leading role in international affairs among the nonaligned nations of the Third World. In 1963 Indonesia gained control of the last Dutch outpost in the Indies, Irian Jaya (western New Guinea). Sukarno's politics moved steadily to the left, and Indonesia became hostile to the West and friendly with China. The influence of the PKI grew steadily. On Sept. 30, 1965, the army crushed an attempted coup by the PKI, setting off a popular reaction in which several hundred thousand people were killed as suspected Communists. Sukarno was shunted aside, and power devolved to Gen. Suharto, who became president in 1968. The PKI was banned, and Indonesian policy swung sharply in favor of the West. The economy grew rapidly, aided by oil revenue, timber exports to Japan, and the Green Revolution in rice agriculture. Foreign investment aided industrial development, which was hampered, however, by domestic content laws and other trade restrictions. A policy of “transmigration” attempted, with mixed success, to move farmers from overcrowded Java and Bali to underdeveloped areas in Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi, and Irian Jaya. In 1975 Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, which was annexed in 1976. More than 100,000 East Timorese have been killed and the annexation was never recognized internationally. In recent years declining oil revenues have been partly offset by the growth of industry and tourism. Pres. Suharto remained in power, at the head of the Golkar united-front party, and was reelected president for a fifth term in 1993. Despite the most violent campaign in Indonesia's history, the ruling Golkar Party was returned to power with nearly 75 percent of the vote in the 1997 parliamentary elections. But Suharto's regime faced serious problems, including continuing unrest in East Timor and rising public dissatisfaction with the alleged corruption of Suharto's family and close associates. The economy boomed in recent years and per capita income steadily grew but in 1998 the financial crisis that swept through Asia revealed the hollowness of the Indonesian approach. Strikes, protests, and riots forced Suharto to resign in May and his trusted aide, Vice-Pres. Habibie took power promising reforms and new elections in 1999. Habibie dropped half of Suharto's cabinet, began reforming the banking system, initiated inquiries into Suharto family wealth, and agreed with Portugal to hold a referendum on the status of East Timor. Elections were held in June 1999 with Golkar taking about 25 percent of the votes; an anti-Golkar coalition headed by Sukarno's daughter, Megawati Sukarnoputri, held a plurality. The people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia, leading to violent attacks by militia groups and the sending of U.N. troops. On Oct. 20, the Assembly approved the East Timor referendum and elected, not Megawati, but ailing Moslem cleric Abdurrahman Wahid as president, with Megawati as vice president. Under attack for his bumbling governance in a time of crisis, Wahid turned over day-to-day management to Megawati in mid-2000. On July 23, 2001 Wahid was formally impeached and replaced by Megawati, as the military refused to act in his behalf. In Feb. 2002 a fragile peace was brokered in the Moluccas between Muslims and Christians with arrests of some of the militia leaders. On May 20, East Timor became independent for the first time in 500 years. In August 2002, the People's Consultative Assembly amended the constitution and established direct election of the president and abolished the military's 38 seats in Parliament. In Oct. terrorists linked to Al Qaeda bombed a Bali nightclub killing 180. In Dec. talks in Geneva with the separatist rebels in Aceh province appeared to have reached success; but in May, 2003 Pres. Megawati delcared martial law in Aceh and another army offensive began against the rebels.
