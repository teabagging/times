The project was a collaboration between Mr. Burle Marx and Conrad Hamerman, a landscape architect in Philadelphia.

The lands that composed Yugoslavia until 1991 were incorporated into the Roman Empire as the province of Illyricum in the first century A.D. Christianity became dominant by A.D. 600. Its nucleus was Serbia, settled in the seventh century by South Slav migrants from the Over and Vistula, and converted to Christianity, in its Eastern Orthodox form, in the ninth century. Twice (in 1077 and again in 1202), the Vatican sent royal crowns to Serbian kings, emphasizing their independence, despite the religious differences. Serbia's medieval zenith came during the reign of Stephen Dushan (1331–55), who subjected Albania, Macedonia, Thessaly, and Epirus to his rule, and who gained the vassalage of Bulgaria in addition. But within 30 years of his death, the Ottoman Turks had overrun his realm, a dominance sealed by the Serbian catastrophe at the Battle of Kosovo (1389). Not until 1878 did Serbia regain independence. The complexities of Balkan politics occupied European statesmen throughout the late 19th century, and the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 led directly to the outbreak of World War I. After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the war, the multiethnic and multinational state of Yugoslavia was patched together in 1918–19. To Serbia were annexed the old Austro-Hungarian lands of Slovenia and Croatia, as well as the ethnically Croatian and Serbian lands of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, Macedonia and Kosovo. The last three were Serbian, Bulgarian, and Albanian in nationality, respectively. The nationalities coexisted in a state of mutual hostility, provoking a royal dictatorship, instituted by King Alexander in 1929 and enduring after his assassination in 1934. Hitler invaded Yugoslavia in 1941; German troops were welcomed in Croatia as liberators from the Serbs. Resistance began almost immediately, split into two mutually hostile groups: Draza Mihajlovic's Serbian royalist Chetniks, and the Partisans, a group of pan-Yugoslav Communists and non-Serbian anti-German forces led by Tito (a.k.a. Josip Broz). By the end of the war, over 2 million Yugoslavs had died, and 3.5 million were homeless. As marshal, backed by both Churchill and Stalin, Tito ruled over a ruined land: the newly created Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. Tito imposed agricultural collectivization on the Stalinist model, and pushed for the development of industry under state ownership. Politically, harsh repression fell on members of the Chetnik resistance as well as on the Slovene Home Guard and the Croatian Ustasa. But the postwar period of tyranny was short-lived. Tito refused to permit Yugoslavia to become a Soviet satellite; in 1948 he expelled Russian military advisers, and was himself expelled from the Comintern. In the face of economic pressure and military threats, Tito turned westward. Stalinism yielded to decentralized communism. The 1953 Agrarian Reform Law permitted private agricultural smallholdings, and over 80 percent of the land returned to private ownership; “self-management” rather than central control was encouraged in the industrial sector as well. Economic growth averaged over 7 percent per year for three decades, lifting Yugoslavia into the ranks of the semideveloped countries. Despite a reconciliation with Khruschev's Soviet Union in 1955–56, Tito continued to chart an independent course, taking a leading role in the Third World Non-Aligned Movement and providing a political and economic alternative model for Eastern Europe. But Yugoslavian nationalism masked the development of separate nationalisms within the Yugoslavian federation. The country's three major ethnic groups (Serbs, Croats, and Muslims) coexisted peacefully under Tito's iron hand, and even after Tito's death in 1980, his rotating presidency scheme, in which the leaders of each republic took turns serving as “president of the presidency,” worked smoothly, as long as Yugoslavia was dominated by communism. But when communism fell in 1989, only Serbia and Montenegro voted for Communist governments, while the republics of Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina sought independence. A vicious civil war ensued in which Yugoslavia's Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic sought to keep all ethnically Serbian areas under Serbian control. While Serb militias captured about one-third of Croatia in 1991, the Croatian army won back most of the region in 1995. And Yugoslavia's attempt to keep Bosnia-Herzegovina within a “greater Serbia” failed as well, the failure ratified in the November 1995 “Dayton Accords,” which brought NATO peacekeepers to the region. The year 1996 saw the formal end of the civil wars, as Milosevic endorsed treaties guaranteeing the boundaries of Macedonia, Croatia and Bosnia; additionally, a pact with the Albanians of Serbia's Kosovo province permitted Albanian as the language of instruction in Kosovo's schools. Though Milosevic and his political allies won 84 of 138 seats in Yugoslavia's parliament in Nov. 1996, the political opposition, called Zajedno (“Together”), won control of 14 large cities. The annulments of these results by Yugoslav courts and electoral commissions provoked 11 weeks of popular protests until Milosevic conceded in Feb. 1997. In July, however, Milosevic maneuvered to take back the presidency by receiving a majority of votes in Parliament. In 1998 ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo province of Serbia launched a terrorist campaign to secede from Serbia and join Albania. The Serbs put down the rebellion with unexpected ferocity. In the winter of 1999 Serbia launched a full-scale attack against Kosovo that drove 700,000 ethnic Albanians from their homes. Despite NATO warnings, Pres. Milosevic continued his ethnic cleansing of Serbia's province and at the end of March NATO began a bombing campaign that lasted 72 days. In June Serbia surrendered and Milosevic agreed to 50,000 NATO troops in Kosovo and the withdrawal of all Yugoslav troops. The U.N. supervised peace was slow to form and soon Serbs were being driven from Kosovo. In 2000 Milosevic managed to maintain his power but his attempt to rig elections in the summer led to mass protests. In 2000, as NATO troops attempted to defend Serbia proper against Albanian incursions from Kosovo, opposition in Serbia to continuance of the Milosevic regime faced police-state measures. A coalition of 15 parties backed Vojislav Kostunica against Milosevic in the Sept. presidential elections. Hundreds of thousands protested the Milosevic attempts to force a run-off and Kostunica was sworn in Oct. 7. Milosevic was turned over to the U.N. for trial on war-crimes charges. In March 2002 the presidents of Serbia and Montenegro agreed to maintain foreign affairs and defense as the sole bonds in a loose federation. The very name “Yugoslavia” was dropped in favor of “Serbia and Montenegro.” Montenegro"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: southeastern Europe.

The Roman province of Dacia was sufficiently Latinized to retain the name of Rome long after the legions withdrew in A.D. 27. Overrun by invading Bulgars in the eighth century, the Romanians retained their Latinate language and orthodox Christianity; Romania remained beyond the borders of the Byzantine Empire but was in close contact with it. The area was conquered by the Mongols in the 13th century and formed the independent principalities of Moldavia and Walachia after the Mongols withdrew. By the 15th century, Moldavia and Walachia had become vassal states of the Ottoman Empire, though with some local autonomy that permitted retention of orthodox Christianity and the creation of a rich local culture. Attempts at national unity against Ottoman rule in 1601 and 1711 failed; in 1861 the provinces united as an autonomous state under the name Romania, within the Ottoman Empire, under Greek administration. Independence came in 1878. Romania was for centuries the poorest country in Europe. Thoroughly agricultural, it was a land of unfree peasants working the great estates of landowners who were generally wealthy, usually absentee, and often Greek. The peasants not only paid taxes but also were required to perform feudal labor services for the estate owners. After enlarging itself at Bulgaria's expense in the Second Balkan War (1913), Romania switched sides three times in World War I, joining the Allies just before the war's end. Its reward was a huge expansion, doubling its territory with lands taken from Austria, Hungary, Russia, and Bulgaria. The interwar period was one of political turbulence, marked by violence and assassinations. Twice King Carol II went into exile, leaving his throne to his son Prince Michael; the second time was in 1940, when Russia (in accordance with the Hitler-Stalin pact) reclaimed the territories of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina it had lost to Romania in 1920; Hitler required Romania to return about half of Transylvania to Hungary. During World War II, the pro-Hitler dictator Marshall Ion Antonescu took power, supported by a semifascist “Iron Guard,” but when the latter attempted a coup, the military crushed the uprising. Romanian troops participated in Hitler's invasion of Russia in 1941, and the country paid the price in 1944 when Russian troops “liberated” the country, with devastating results. The country was quickly transformed into a Soviet satellite through rigged elections in which the communist National Democratic Front replaced the Peasant Alliance in power; a People's Republic was proclaimed on Dec. 30, 1947, and King Michael was forced to abdicate. A peace treaty in 1947 confirmed the loss of Bessarabia to Russia but returned Transylvania to Romania. Under Russian occupation Romania was a virtual Soviet colony. The occupying armies did not leave until after reparation payments were completed in 1958, leaving the dictator Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej in power. Despite Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) plans for Romania to become a major food supplier to the Soviet bloc, Gheorghiu-Dej pursued industrialization on the Stalinist model, in the process ruining Romanian agriculture while creating large, labor-intensive, and highly inefficient factories. The result was an economic depression; politically, however, it produced a de facto independence for Romania within the Soviet bloc. Russian troops were forbidden on Romanian soil, and Romania declined to participate in COMECON policies. With the death of Gheorghiu-Dej in 1965, power passed to Nicolae Ceausescu. He promulgated a new constitution and instituted a series of purges; he became party leader in 1965, prime minister in 1967, and president of the republic in 1974. Ceausescu continued his predecessor's economic policy, deepening the country's misery; he also pursued a policy of “independence” from the U.S.S.R., refusing to go along with Soviet policies of de-Stalinization and liberalization. Romania's “national communism” was expressed in militant nationalism, coupled with severe repression of ethnic minorities, especially Germans and Magyars in Transylvania. Hundreds of Hungarian villages were bulldozed into oblivion in the name of agricultural collectivization. Ceausescu's ambitions included the creation of a family dynasty in the Romanian leadership. In 1979 his wife Elena was named first deputy premier and elevated to the Council of Ministers. Her brothers were given important government positions; Ceausescu's son, despite his reputation as a playboy, was groomed to replace his father. Romania's transition from Communist rule was sudden and violent. On Dec. 16–18, 1989, demonstrations in Timisoara calling for Ceausescu's ouster were put down with brute force by the Securitate (secret police), but they spread and citizens and regular army troops fought pitched battles with Securitate forces in Bucharest. Ceausescu and his wife fled Bucharest but were captured, tried, and executed. The newly organized Council of National Salvation established a provisional government, consisting primarily of anti-Ceausescu Communists in league with the Romanian army, with former Communist party official Ion Iliescu as president. The Communist party was outlawed on Jan. 12, 1990. Despite the Council's domination by former Communists, no effective opposition movement emerged, and in hastily called and rigged elections on May 20, Iliescu was elected president in a landslide and the Council won 233 of 296 seats in the lower house. In June 1990, many anti-Communist demonstrators were beaten and several killed by troops and armed miners brought to Bucharest by the government. Calls for Iliescu's resignation and a purge of Communists from government grew. Tensions were aggravated when the government's abrupt move to a market economy resulted in food shortages and price increases. Continued rioting in 1991 led to the replacement of ex-Communist prime minister Petre Roman by the non-Communist Theodor Stolojan at the head of a “caretaker” coalition. More or less free elections in 1992 gave the National Salvation Front 28 percent of the seats in Parliament while the opposition Democratic Convention gained 20 percent; Iliescu defeated the Democratic Convention candidate in the presidential election with 61 percent of the vote. Both Iliescu and the prime minister he named (Nicolae Vacaroiu) were pledged to slowing the transition to a market economy but by 1994 with inflation at over 250 percent (leading to a massive workers' strike in Feb.) the government agreed to I.M.F.'s demand for increased privatization and fiscal austerity in order to receive a $700 mil. loan. Iliescu's presidency ended in Nov. 1996 with a coalition government headed by Emil Constantinescu immediately forging public links to the Romanian Orthodox Church ending decades of official atheism and taking action against corrupt banking officials, businessmen, and politicians. The economy remained in dire straits but in early 1997 loans were secured from the I.M.F. and the World Bank. Elections in Nov. 1997 were won by Emil Constantinescu of the Democratic Convention party who became president and Victor Ciorbea the prime minister. Inflation and unemployment were falling but GDP growth was lagging and, with a patchwork tax system, international default looked likely. I.M.F. demands for restructuring as a condition of further loans produced government plans which included the closing of mines whose operation had lost $4 billion since 1990. But that in turn produced, in early 1999, widespread protest marches and violence by mine workers whose role in 1990 was not forgotten. Parliamentary elections in Nov. 2000 gave a preponderance to the parties of the left, but the presidential election drew greater interest: Ion Iliescu, claiming now to be a reformer and a pro-westerner, carried two-thirds of the vote in the December run-off.

The Magyars, a tribe of Central Asian horsemen, terrorized Europe in the ninth century A.D. and settled in the Hungarian plain where, under their chieftain Arpad, they displaced earlier Germanic and Slavic settlers and organized a kingdom in 896. The Hungarians converted to Christianity late in the 10th century, and King Stephen (later St. Stephen) received a royal crown from Pope Sylvester II in 1001. After the Battle of Mohacs in 1526, most of Hungary fell under Ottoman rule. The Turks were driven out in a series of battles with the Habsburg Holy Roman emperors at the end of the 17th century. Thereafter Hungary was part of the Habsburg Empire until 1867, when the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary was organized, making Hungary independent of Austria in all but finance, the military, and foreign affairs. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Hungary experienced extensive immigration of Romanians and Slovaks; by 1900 Magyars formed only a bare majority of the population. The pre-World War I economy was largely agricultural. Agriculture-related industry (beet sugar factories, breweries, tanneries, textile mills) developed in the late 19th century, along with some heavy industry. In the dismemberment of Austria-Hungary following the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, Hungary surrendered extensive territories to Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. With the Treaty of Trianon (“Bloody Trianon”) in 1920, the country lost 70 percent of its territory and 60 percent of its population; one-third of the Magyar people lived on foreign soil. Short-lived governments—a republic under Michael Karolyi, and a Bolshevist state under Bela Kun—were replaced in 1920 by a new regime, with Adm. Miklós Horthy serving as regent. The Horthy regime was authoritarian but not fascist; its main objective was the recovery of Hungary's lost territories. Hungary established common cause with Germany in 1938 and 1940, recovering some territory from Czechoslovakia and Romania in the bargain, but at the price of participating in Hitler's war with the Soviet Union. Germany occupied Hungary in 1944 and set up a Hungarian Nazi regime. Late in 1944 the Russian army drove out the Germans and set up their own occupation. The establishment of a full-scale Soviet-satellite regime was relatively slow. A republic was declared in February 1946, and the non-Communist Zoltan Tildy was elected president. Tildy was forced out in 1947, however, and replaced by the Stalinist dictator, Matias Rakosi. After the death of Stalin in 1953, the moderate Imre Nagy became premier and introduced some economic reforms. Nagy was forced out of office in 1955. Nikita Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in 1956, combined with rising expectations for reforms in Hungary, led to a popular uprising in October 1956. Nagy, backed by the army, formed a coalition government on Oct. 23, proclaimed Hungary's neutrality, ended censorship, opened the borders, and withdrew from the Warsaw Pact. On Nov. 4, Soviet troops launched a massive invasion that crushed the rebellion. The Soviet army installed János Kádár as premier; Nagy was executed. About 200,000 Hungarians fled the country, and many more were imprisoned. After several years of repressive rule, the Kádár regime announced, in 1963, amnesty for participants in the 1956 rebellion. Stalinists were gradually removed from the government, economic reforms emphasizing profit and productivity were introduced, and trade with the West was expanded. Hungary reluctantly took part in the suppression of Czechoslovakia's “Prague Spring” in 1968. In the same year, it announced the New Economic Mechanism (NEM) policy, ending central economic planning and introducing semifree enterprise under bureaucratic control. After a brief return to central planning in the 1970's, the NEM was reintroduced in 1979 and expanded in 1982, when Hungary joined the World Bank and the I.M.F.. Private ownership of subsidiaries of state-owned enterprises was permitted. In 1987 a pro-Gorbachev premier, Karoly Grosz, took office and in 1988 became head of the Communist party as well. In 1989 the boundary with Austria was opened, making Hungary a key escape point for refugees from East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Nagy's reburial was attended by 300,000. Free elections were held in 1990, and the Democratic Forum, led by Jozsef Antall, won a plurality and formed a coalition government with the Smallholders and Christian Democratic parties. Having already achieved substantial perestroika-style economic reforms under communism, Hungary was well-placed to make a rapid transition to free enterprise and was seeking admission to the E.U. Sluggish production reduced tax revenues, resulting in serious deficits and an austerity budget. Hungarian voters signaled just how painful they found the transition in the 1994 parliamentary elections by giving the Communists (now renamed Socialists) an absolute majority in Parliament. Privatization moved at a snail's pace, though the new government did appoint a committee to arrange the selling off of about 1,000 state-owned enterprises and soon foreign investment increased faster than anywhere in Central Europe. In 1997 Hungary was one of three eastern European nations invited to apply for admission to NATO and it was admitted in 1999.

Major trading partners: (2001) Germany, Slovakia,Russia, U.K. A Moravian empire, Christianized by Cyril and Methodius, existed in the ninth century until destroyed by the Magyars. From the 10th through the 14th century, Bohemia and Moravia, “lands of the crown of St. Vaclav,” formed an independent kingdom within the Holy Roman Empire under the Czech Premsylid dynasty. In 1526 the crown lands came under Habsburg rule, a rule that lasted until World War I. They were the richest crown lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Prosperous agriculture in the central plains and mineral wealth in the hill country were supplemented in the 19th century by industrial development led by urban middle classes, who were largely German and Jewish. With the crumbling of the Habsburg monarchy during the war, a new multinational state of Czechoslovakia emerged, founded by Eduard Benes and Thomas Masaryk, in which the Czechs (only 45% of the population) ruled over Germans, Slovaks, Magyars, Poles, and Ukranians. Yet it was the most democratic state in Central Europe between the wars. Following the Munich Pact of September 1938, Hitler annexed the German-speaking regions of the “Sudetenland,” and in 1939 he established a “protectorate” over the Czech lands, while Slovakia became a self-governing satellite republic. With the collapse of Hitler's Reich, Czechoslovakia was reestablished (except for the Carpatho-Ukraine, which it was compelled to cede to the U.S.S.R.) with Benes again as president and a socialist government, independent but pro-Soviet. Three million Germans were expelled, with tens of thousands killed either in mob violence or after hasty trials before “Special People's Courts.” In 1948 a Communist coup forced Benes to resign; he was replaced by the Communist leader Klement Gottwald. Jan Masaryk, the foreign minister, committed suicide or was murdered. Purges and persecutions followed. With Stalin's death in 1953, Gottwald was replaced as party first secretary by Stalinist hard-liner Antonin Novotny, who also became president in 1957. In 1968 Novotny was replaced as first secretary by a Slovak liberal, Alexander Dubcek. Czechoslovakia suddenly was in the vanguard of communist reform. The new regime abolished censorship, denounced Stalin, decentralized economic decision-making, and granted real power to the National Assembly. The brief “Prague Spring” ended in Aug. 1968, when Warsaw Pact troops invaded. In 1969 Dubcek was replaced by Gustáv Husak. The party was purged, censorship restored, dissent repressed, and the centralized economy restored. The 1970's brought inflation and economic stagnation but produced no change in policy. The rise of the Solidarity movement in Poland in the early 1980's provoked a backlash of preventive repression in Czechoslovakia, aimed especially at Charter 77, a human-rights organization, and at the Catholic church. The pro-democracy movement began in earnest in October 1989, inspired by a lack of confidence in Communist rule and by reform movements throughout Eastern Europe. The resignation of Communist leaders throughout December culminated in the parliamentary election of Václav Havel, a dissident playwright and head of a loose coalition of opposition groups called Civic Forum, as president, and the vindicated Alexander Dubcek as chairman of Parliament. Despite severe economic difficulties, revelations of state security abuses, environmental pollution, and other problems inherited from the Communist era, Czechoslovakia's “Velvet Revolution” seemed a resounding political and popular success. In 1990 Soviet troops left and Civic Forum and its Slovakian ally, Public Against Violence, won 47% of the vote in parliamentary elections, against 14% for the Communists and 12% for the Christian Democrats. Vaclav Havel was elected president, and Marian Calfa became prime minister. But Slovak-Czech resentments and Slovakia's economic distress led to a separation of the two republics, effective Jan. 1, 1993. In June 1996, the first elections in the new Czech Republic gave 99 (out of 200) seats to the three-party center-right coalition (led by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and President Havel) which had guided the Czech Republic's successful transition to a market economy. After several years of prosperity, the Czech Republic suddenly fell on hard times in 1997, and Klaus was forced to introduce austerity measures. Revelations of campaign finance irregularities brought Klaus' resignation in Nov. 1997. In the subsequent June 1998 elections, the Social Democrats won a plurality of seats and, with the Civic Democrats' agreement, formed a minority government for the next four years. The budget adopted in Jan. 1999 included the republic's first planned deficit as the nagging recession continued, with little economic growth forecast and unemployment rising to 9.5 percent. In the 2002 elections, the Social Democrats won a plurality but no majority in the Chamber of Deputies, necessitating a coalition with the Christian Democratic Union/Freedom Party and Vladimir Spidla remaining prime minister and Vaclav Klaus becoming president. In June, a referendum of Czech voters approved E.U. membership with a 77 percent “yes” vote. Czech Republic"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: western coast of Africa.

The Nok culture of central Nigeria (500–200 B.C.) was one of the richest and most advanced ancient civilizations in western Africa. Around A.D. 1000, the Muslim Kanem civilization expanded into northern Nigeria; by the 14th century, the amalgamated kingdom of Kanem-Bornu took northern Nigeria as its political center, from which it dominated the Sahel and developed trade routes stretching throughout northern Africa and as far as Europe and the Middle East. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the Hausa Songhai empire rose to power. It was overthrown by the Fulani Muslim leader Uthman Dan Fodio, who created the Sokoto caliphate. Southern Nigeria is dominated by the Yoruba, whose Oyo kingdom, centered at Ife, became a major power by A.D. 1000. Oyo gave rise to the Benin civilization, which flourished from the 15th to the 18th centuries and is famous for its brass, bronze, and ivory sculpture. The Portuguese established trading stations on the Benin coast in the 15th century; initially, trade relations were cordial, and Benin became well-known in Europe as a powerful and advanced kingdom. With the rise of the slave trade (which began with the cooperation of the Benin kings, who brought slaves from the interior), relations became hostile, and Benin declined under European pressure. The Dutch, British, and other Europeans competed strenuously with Portugal for control of the slave trade, and by the 18th century, most of the coastal region of Nigeria was under British control. By the turn of the 19th century, Britain suppressed the slave trade; slaves captured aboard European ships were transported by the British to Freetown in Sierra Leone. The British traded with Nigerians for agricultural and forest products and commenced exploration of the Niger River. Lagos came under British control in 1851, and in 1861 Nigeria was made a British colony. Despite native resistance the colony was expanded in 1906 to include territory east of the Niger River, which was called the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, The two areas were administratively joined in 1914. During the 1920's Britain began to respond to Nigerian demands for self-rule. In 1946 the colony was divided into three regions, each with an advisory assembly. In 1954 the colony was reorganized as the Nigerian Federation, and the assemblies were given more authority. Sir Akubar Tafawa Balewa became Nigeria's first prime minister. The 1960's were marked by a struggle for political dominance among the major ethnic groups of Nigeria, including the Ibo (or Igbo), Yoruba, Hausa, and Fulani. Attempts to partition the country on tribal lines for administrative purposes provoked controversy, and charges of corruption and fraud in elections held in 1964 and 1965 led to violence and rioting. In January 1966 civil war broke out when a group of Ibo army officers overthrew the central government. Prime Minister Balewa was killed, along with many other political leaders in the northern and western parts of the country. Gen. Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, leader of the Ibo forces, took control of the government. Aguiyi-Ironsi abolished the country's federal structure and set up a strong central government, dominated by the Ibo. Anti-Ibo riots broke out in the north, and many Ibo were massacred. In July 1966 Aguiyi-Ironsi was assassinated by a group of northern army officers. Army Chief of Staff Yakubu Gowon became head of a new military government. In 1967 Gowon reapportioned Nigeria into 12 states. The Eastern Region rejected this plan and seceded from Nigeria to form the independent state of Biafra, provoking a civil war that lasted until January 1970, when Biafra was rejoined with Nigeria. An estimated one million Biafrans, mostly Ibos, died in the war. Gowon tried to rebuild the Eastern Region and create a harmonious multitribal government, but he was overthrown in a coup in 1975. His successor was assassinated in 1976 and succeeded by Lt. Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo who increased the number of states from 12 to 19 and promised a return to civilian rule. Shehu Shagari was elected president in 1979 and reelected in 1983, but in Dec. 1983 the military again intervened. Nigeria's crude oil resources fueled the economy and made it attractive for foreign investment. During the 1970's, petroleum exports helped Nigeria recover from the Biafran War. But corruption and overspending of projected petroleum revenues led to an economic crisis in the early 1980's as oil prices collapsed worldwide. Inflation, unemployment, and food shortages led to rioting in major population centers in 1986. And in 1987, religious violence broke out between the Christian south and the Muslim north. The government of Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida responded by announcing plans for a new constitution, various economic austerity measures, and the restoration of civilian rule by 1992. He also limited the number of political parties and dictated both party platforms in National Assembly elections held in 1992, and in 1993, he annulled the results of the presidential election, which international monitors said would have been won by opposition leader Moshood K. Abiola, who was taken prisoner for the “treason” of declaring himself the election winner. Babangida resigned in Aug. 1993, but his self-appointed successor was ousted in a November 1993 coup by Defense Minister Sani Abacha. Abacha's tyrrany survived until his death in June 1998. A “transitional” military government led by army chief of staff, Abdusalem Abubakar, freed political prisoners (Abiola dying just before his release), held local, state, and national elections (Dec.–Feb.), and turned over power, May 29, 1999 to the first popularly-elected president in 16 years, former general and once military ruler, Olusegun Obasanjo. The new government faced formidable problems: increased Moslem-Christian violence as northern states attempted to impose Sharia (Koranic law); civil disorder and rioting in the face of increased fuel prices. In July 2000, violence and bloodshed over the imposition of Sharia increased. Attempts to meet I.M.F. loan conditions, such as ending subsidies which kept oil prices low or reducing government payrolls, provoked riots and strikes. Hausa-Yoruba tribal conflict in Lagos left over 100 dead. Amidst religious, ethnic, and economic turmoil, Pres. Obasanjo (the first civilian president after almost 20 years of military rule) won a second term in 2003.

Malta, an ancient crossroads of Mediterranean trade, was ruled successively by Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines before being conquered by Islamic Saracens from North Africa in the ninth century. In 1090 the Norman kings of Sicily conquered it and made it a way station for the First Crusade. In 1530 Charles V gave the island to the Knights Hospitalers (the Knights of Malta). The island withstood a siege by the Ottoman Turks in 1565 and fell only to Napoleon in 1798. Malta came under British rule in 1800, and was annexed in 1814. Limited self-rule was granted under the constitutions of 1921 and 1939. During World War II, Malta suffered devastating air raids by German and Italian forces; the entire population was awarded the George Cross for bravery. In 1964 Malta was granted independence within the British Commonwealth, with Elizabeth II as its sovereign. Abrogating its mutual defense treaty with Great Britain in 1971, the Maltese government severed all ties to the British Crown, becoming a fully independent republic.

The territory of present-day Azerbaijan has been inhabited since Paleolithic times. The name Azerbaijan is derived (via Arabic and Turkish) from Atropates (a vassal of Alexander III of Macedonia), who founded an independent state here in the fourth century B.C. The population of Azerbaijan is approximately seven million, but nearly seven million additional Azeris with the same language and faith live across the border in Iran. For much of its history, the territory of Azerbaijan, home to an indigenous nomadic people, has been occupied by Persians, Muslim Arabs, Turkic tribes from Mongolia, Ottoman Turks, Mongols, and in the 18th century, Russians. The capital city of Baku was an important outlet on the Volga River-Caspian Sea route; under Peter the Great, the Russians occupied Baku and Derbent, and for a while controlled the Caspian Sea. Command of this territory shifted between Ottomans, Persians, and Russians in the 18th and 19th centuries, with the Russians ultimately establishing military rule by 1828 with the Treaty of Turkmenchai. This treaty ceded the southern half of the country to Persia and the northern half to Russia. Under the Russians, Azerbaijan became an industrial center and eventually a major oil producer. In 1883 the Russians finished building the Transcaucasian Railway, which linked Baku with the Black Sea coast and central Russia and made Baku one of the most important industrial hubs in the Russian empire. Baku became a revolutionary center around the turn of the century. In 1918 an independent republic was formed, but in 1920 it was overthrown by the Soviet Red Army, and in April 1920 the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) was proclaimed. Two years later, it was joined with the Armenian and Georgian SSRs to form the Transcaucasian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic; in 1936, however, the three again became separate union republics. While a Soviet republic, Azerbaijan was industrialized, its agriculture collectivized, and religious persecution was severe. It also entered into a war in 1988 with neighboring Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is largely populated with ethnic Armenians but lies within Azerbaijani territory. The local council of Nagorno-Karabakh petitioned the Armenian and Azerbaijani Supreme Soviets to transfer the region to Armenia in 1988, but Azerbaijan refused, spurring a war that lasts to this day. In Jan. 1990, attacks on Communist party buildings and against Armenians in Azerbaijan precipitated a brutal Soviet Army intervention to restore order. A state of emergency was declared, and the first secretary of the Communist party was replaced by Ayaz Mutalibov. He was elected president in Sept. 1991, and on Oct. 18, 1991, Azerbaijan's Supreme Soviet declared the country's independence. On Dec. 21, 1991, Azerbaijan joined 10 other former Soviet republics in forming the Commonwealth of Independent States. After the dissolution of the U.S.S.R., Azerbaijan had problems consolidating its own future. In 1992, Pres. Mutalibov was forced from office. His successor was in turn driven out of office by armed rebels after the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh turned decisively in Armenia's favor. He was replaced by Heydar Aliyev, a former Communist party boss, in 1993. Aliyev survived two coup attempts and the country's flagging fortunes in Nagorno-Karabakh to complete a $7.4 billion deal with western companies to develop oil fields in the Caspian Sea in Sept. 1994. In parliamentary elections in 1995, Aliyev's New Azerbaijan party won 70 percent of the vote, amidst charges of vote-rigging. And in Jan. 1996, Aliyev negotiated an agreement to transport oil from the Caspian Sea via pipeline (through Chechnya) to the Russian port of Novorossiysk for export to the world market. The pipeline opened Nov. 12, 1997, soon after Aliyev met with Pres. Clinton in Washington to sign a treaty allowing transfer of profits and capital between U.S. and Azerbaijan. In Oct. 1998, Aliyev held presidential elections which were boycotted by opposition parties and which European monitors declared to be seriously irregular. Aliyev took 76 percent of the vote. In parliamentary elections in Nov. 2000, his New Azerbaijan Party carried 70 percent of the vote, to no one's surprise. The ailing president, in Sept. 2002, oversaw the start of construction on a major oil pipeline from the Caspian through Georgia to Turkey (bypassing both Russia and Iran) and signed a treaty with Russia regularizing the Caspian border.

Early in the Christian era, the Mayan civilization extended south to the pre-Columbian city of Copán in what is now northwestern Honduras. The territory was also home to the Lenca Indians and the indigenous people of the Moskitia area. A silver strike in the 1570's prompted the first major influx of Spanish. The region was also celebrated for its tropical hardwood forests. Although the British controlled the Caribbean coast in the late 1700's, Honduras was a province of the Spanish captaincy of Guatemala. It became a member of the United Provinces of Central America after independence from Spain and Mexico, and an independent republic after the 1838 collapse of the Central American Federation. Conservatives dominated Honduran politics until the 1870's, when the Liberals came to power and adopted a new constitution that reduced the influence of the church, among other things. Economic development came especially from a number of U.S. firms whose efforts were regarded as exploitative rather than beneficial; in 1912, U.S. president William Taft sent marines to protect U.S. interests. Political unrest continued until the presidency of Gen. Tuburcio Carías Andino (1932–49), who was followed by a succession of pro-labor presidents. In 1963, a coup led by Col. Osvaldo López Arellano deposed the civilian president, and the military ruled almost uninterrupted until 1982. In 1969, the expulsion of thousands of Salvadoran peasants who had immigrated during the 1950's and 1960's led to the Soccer War with El Salvador. An armistice was negotiated by the OAS. During the 1980's, Honduras was threatened by civil wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua. Honduran territory was used by Nicaraguan Contras, for which Honduras received substantial U.S. military and other aid. Demobilization of the Contras alleviated tensions between Left and Right, and in Jan. 1994 the new president, Carlos Roberto Reina Idiaquez, took office with the promise of controlling and reducing the power of the military which was more easily accomplished when the U.S. made severe cuts in military aid. In late 1997 the same Liberal Party easily won reelection, maintaining their control of the National Congress, while their candidate, Carlos Roberto Flores, won election as president. In Oct. 1999, Honduras was devastated by Hurricane Mitch: 7,000 were dead, 600,000 homeless, and 70 percent of its crops destroyed—losses somewhat mitigated by international aid and debt reductions. In Jan. 1999, the legislature unanimously voted to place the autonomous military under civilian control. The Liberal Party was unseated in Nov. 2001 as the National Party elected only its second president since 1981, Ricardo Maduro.

In later times others, including the Bamileke, Bassa, Douala, and Fulani, migrated into the region. Portuguese trading stations were established along the coast beginning in the 15th century, and between 1500 and the early 19th century, the population was severely depleted by the slave trade in the hands of various European nations. European rivalries for domination in Cameroon were settled temporarily in 1884 when Germany established a protectorate. British and French troops invaded German Cameroon during World War I, and following the war the League of Nations divided the protectorate into two mandated territories—French in the eastern sector and British in the west. French Cameroon rejected the Vichy government in World War II and became an important African base for Charles de Gaulle's Free French. In 1946 British and French rule in Cameroon was reaffirmed under U.N. trusteeships. In 1958 the French trusteeship was abolished, and the Republic of Cameroon became independent on Jan. 1, 1960. In February 1961 a U.N.-supervised plebiscite was held in British Cameroon, allowing the people of that region to choose between union with Nigeria and union with the Republic of Cameroon. The northern two-thirds of the British territory elected union with Nigeria; the southern portion joined the Republic of Cameroon on Oct. 1, 1961, to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. In 1972 the federal structure was abolished by a national referendum, and the United Republic of Cameroon was established. In 1984 the nation's name reverted to the Republic of Cameroon. During the federal period, Cameroon had a multiparty political system, with party divisions coinciding with the old distinctions between west and east Cameroon. In 1966 all political parties were amalgamated to form the Cameroon National Union, which, with various changes in name, has dominated the political life of Cameroon ever since. In 1980 Pres. Ahidjo, the long-time political leader of Cameroon, was elected without opposition to a fifth five-year term in office. He resigned in 1982 and was replaced by Prime Minister Paul Biya, who was reelected in his own right in 1984. He instituted political reforms whereby multiple candidates ran for office within the structure of the country's single-party system. In 1992 he was elected president in the nation's first multiparty elections. His closest rival was put under house arrest. The economy of Cameroon is based primarily on agriculture; it is self-sufficient in food and exports coffee, cocoa, rubber, cotton, palm oil, and timber. Oil is the principal export, however, accounting for 60 percent of export earnings. Cameroon"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: southeastern Europe.

Bosnia-Herzegovina has been in the middle of European power struggles since the 14th century. Its constantly changing boundaries have meant that its population has always been a hodgepodge of races and ethnicities. The name Bosnia comes from the region's geographic location on the Bosna River; Herzegovina was originally an Austrian border duchy (Herzog means “duke” in German). The two lands were conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century, Bosnia in 1463, Herzegovina 20 years later. The conquered peoples, united into one administrative district by the Turks, were Roman Catholic Croatians and Orthodox Serbs. Over the centuries, a number of Slavic families, Croatians more than Serbs, gave up their Christianity and adopted the religion of their conquerors: Islam. A peasant uprising (1875) over Turkish refusal to institute reforms ultimately led to the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78. In 1878, the Congress of Berlin put Bosnia-Herzegovina under the control of Austria-Hungary. Sarajevo, the capital city, was the birthplace of World War I, where a Serbian nationalist assassinated the Austro-Hungarian archduke Francis Ferdinand in 1914. By 1918, Serbia had annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina and held it until World War I, when Germany incorporated it into the state of Croatia. In 1946, Bosnia-Herzegovina was made one of Yugoslavia's six constituent republics, along with Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, and Macedonia. The constant redrawing of Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders has meant that ethnicity in the region came to be based on religion, rather than national origin. Thus a Serb who converted to Roman Catholic Christianity was considered a Croatian, while a Croatian who converted to Eastern Orthodoxy was considered a Serb. And to both groups, converts to Islam appeared to be collaborators with the Ottoman Turks. Nevertheless, the three ethnic groups coexisted peacefully under the iron hand of president-for-life Marshall Tito (Josip Broz). And even after Tito's death in 1980, his rotating presidency scheme, in which the leaders of each republic took turns serving as “president of the presidency,” worked smoothly, as long as Yugoslavia was dominated by communism. At times, the president was a Muslim, the prime minister was a Croatian, and the president of the Assembly was a Serb. But when communism fell in 1989, only Serbia and Montenegro returned Communist governments to power; the other four republics established non- and even anti-Communist governments, and quickly sought to establish political independence from the ultra-Marxist regime of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. Milosevic rigged elections in the provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina to keep them under Serbian control, but he was unsuccessful in ethnically Serbian areas of Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia and Slovenia declared their independence in 1991, forcing Bosnia to choose between independence or a diminished role in a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. Bosnia-Herzegovina voted for independence in March 1992. But the mostly Serbian military of the former Yugoslavian army refused to go along with the vote. Led by Radovan Karadzic, they gained control of the region's artillery and proclaimed the existence of the “Serbian Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.” The siege of Sarajevo began a month after the vote for independence, with Serbia waging a ferocious war of “ethnic cleansing,” in which they sought to rid Bosnia of Muslims and Croats. By July 1993, the Serbs surrounded the city, cutting off delivery of arms and supplies to Bosnian forces. Despite evidence that the Serbs were raping and torturing Muslims, the Bosnian Parliament in Sept. 1993 rejected a U.N.-sponsored peace plan that would have ended the war. Several other cease-fire agreements were brokered throughout 1993 and 1994, but none led to a lasting peace until a 1995 pact brokered by U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke, in which the Bosnian Serbs agreed to follow the decisions of Yugoslavia's president Slobodan Milosevic in all peace talks. On Nov. 21, 1995, the presidents of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia met in Dayton, Ohio, to sign a peace accord ending the civil war and dividing Bosnia-Herzegovina into two entities: a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation. The two statelets would be governed by the same legislature and president. The U.N. sent 60,000 peacekeeping troops (20,000 Americans) in Dec. 1995 to supervise the transition. Elections in Sept. 1996 selected a three-member collective presidency, chaired by Muslim Alijia Izetbegovic, and a legislature whose 42 members were selected in two separate elections, 28 from the Federation and 14 from the Srpska Republic. In Jan. 1997, parliament approved a cabinet with joint (Serb and Muslim) premiers. Yugoslavia and Bosnia established diplomatic relations in Oct. 1996, with Yugoslavia agreeing to respect Bosnia's boundaries while Bosnia dropped charges of genocide. A new crisis arose when on the same day (March 5, 1999), the West's “High Authority” (under the Dayton Accords) deposed the President of the Serb Republic, who had just been elected, while a Western arbitrator awarded the strategic Sava River town of Brcko to the Moslem-Croat Federation, resulting in the Serb republic's effective withdrawal from Bosnia-Herzegovnia. Through 2000 and 2001 incidents of friction continued, provoking interventions by the High Authority and NATO troops, which themselves became sources of tension and even riots. In Oct. 2002, elections of bewildering complexity were held: for the three-man presidency, for the federation's parliament, and for the parliaments of the two member republics, with 57 parties taking part. Where true authority lay was made clear in April as Chairman of the Presidency, Mirko Sarovic, resigned before he could be sacked by the High Commissioner who, in the same month, transferred control of the armed forces from the republics to the central authority.

Mr. Hoener was a financier, a philanthropist, and a noted collector of German expressionist art. Born in Allenstein, Germany, he graduated from the University of Koeln with a Masters Degree in Business Administration. Mr. Hoener then studied law in Goettingen, Germany before coming to the United States, where he earned an LL.M. degree from the University of California at Berkeley. Early in his career, Mr. Hoener served as a Vice President in the Corporate Finance and Merger and Acquisition Departments of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Morgan Stanley International in New York, Paris, and London. Mr. Hoener left Morgan Stanley to serve as the asset manager of a major private European investment pool and, in 1981 established a private investment company in New York to facilitate the re-allocation of his clients' assets into high-growth small capitalization equities in the United States, principally through a venture capital investment program. Having retired from active management, in recent years Mr. Hoener sought to promote venture capital investment in Europe and was honored by the ETH Zurich for initiating and sponsoring a highly successful lecture series on venture capital held in Zurich and St. Gallen. Mr. Hoener received awards from both Germany and the United States of America in recognition of his contributions to the promotion of German-American relations. For many years, he was a member of the board of directors of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies. In addition to funding many other charitable causes, he was a principal supporter of the Fulbright Scholarship Program. His philanthropic efforts brought Mr. Hoener many commendations from governments and from private organizations.

Two deluxe cruise lines, Crystal Cruises and the Seabourn Cruise Line, have responded by canceling their plans to operate ships in the region next year.   Duncan Beardsley, president of Seabourn, said, \\"People are still interested in the Mediterranean, but not the eastern part.\\"   Seabourn, based in San Francisco, said it had rerouted six cruises of the Seabourn Pride, a 204-passenger ship, which had been scheduled to embark from Venice and make stopovers in Istanbul between May and August. Instead of Istanbul, Seabourn said the ship will make stopovers in Lisbon, Nice and other western Mediterranean ports.    Crystal, based in Los Angeles, said its 960-passenger Crystal Harmony, which was to make seven cruises in the eastern Mediterranean between August and November, would be recalled to the United States. Crystal said the ship would likely operate between New York and Montreal, with stopovers in New England. Before the tensions arising from Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, the ship's destinations were to have included Istanbul, Odessa and Alexandria.    \\"We are responding to our guests' requests,\\" said Darlene Papalini, a Crystal spokeswoman. \\"There is just a reluctance to travel to the eastern Mediterranean.\\" Both companies said passengers who had booked passage on the canceled cruises were being offered alternative routes or their money back. Polar Voyage On Soviet Ship    Western passengers can travel aboard a nuclear-powered Soviet icebreaker when she sets off July 26, 1991, from Murmansk to Nome, Alaska, via the North Pole. After the voyage -- said to be the first complete transpolar voyage on any vessel -- the ship, the Sovetsky Soyuz, will depart from Nome (pending United States Government approval) on Aug. 19 and return to Murmansk through the Northeast Passage, bound for remote towns in northern Siberia, offshore islands and the North Cape of Norway.   The two 21-day voyages, offered by Salen Lindblad Cruising, will cost from $25,000 to $32,000 a person, depending on the choice of cabin.   The 500-foot vessel has 48 twin cabins, two lounges, a dining room, pool and sauna and lecture theater. The ship attains a cruising speed of 18.8 knots at sea and 10 knots through ice five feet thick.    The ship has two lounges as well as a dining room, two saunas, gymnasium, indoor pool and a 100-seat tiered lecture theater with stage. Information: Salen Lindblad Cruising, 203-967-2900 or 800-223-5688. Eurailpass for Car and Trains    Eurailpass will introduce three programs for 1991 and expand its destinations. For the first time, the pass -- allowing unlimited train travel in 17 countries -- will be valid throughout unified Germany, including Berlin. Eurailpass also has introduced a EurailDrive Pass, which offers travelers the combined use of rail and rental car in 16 countries.   The program allows four days of rail travel and three days of Hertz car rental within a 21-day period. The per-person rate, when two or more people travel together, is $269 for an economy car, $289 for a small car and $299 for medium size. In this plan, the rental car may be returned to any city in the country where the car was picked up.    Eurailpass has also expanded its Youthpasses for next year. Travelers under the age of 26 may use the rail system for 15 individual days of second-class travel during a three-month period for a cost of $340","excerpt":"30 days of travel during that period costs $540.    The declining value of the dollar has led to price increases for most other Eurailpasses. In 1991, the consecutive-day price structure will be: $390 for 15 days of first-class travel; $498 for 21 days; $616 for a month; $840 for two months, and $1,042 for three months. Fifteen days of first-class travel between April 1 and Sept. 30 will be $298 a person, for travel by three or more people.

To join, send a check for $65 payable to the French Government to the French Government Tourist Office, 610 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10020 A $6 Dinner In Prague     PRAGUE -- The kosher restaurant in Prague's Jewish Town Hall, long a lunchtime haunt of tourists and local people, Jews and non-Jews alike, recently began serving evening meals. The dinnertime ambiance -- tablecloths, low lights and a pianist -- is more sophisticated than the clamor at lunchtime.   One simple set menu, changing daily, is available at lunch, which costs about $3.50. In the evening, there is a more ambitious choice of three set menus ranging from $2 to $6 and, unlike at lunch, alcoholic beverages are served. The $6 dinner, called the supermenu, includes appetizer, soup, fish, vegetables, main meat course, dessert and fruit, coffee or tea.   The restaurant, in a high-ceilinged, ground-floor hall of the bright pink Old Jewish Town Hall on Maiselova Street, is around the corner from the Old-New Synagogue and the various parts of the Jewish Museum, including the Old Cemetery. The Town Hall, originally built in the 16th century and still the headquarters of the Prague Jewish community, is a five-minute walk from the Old Town Square. -- RUTH GRUBER Diversions For Children    For children who ask \\"Are we there yet?\\" the American Automobile Association offers a \\"Travel Activity Book,\\" which includes pictures to color and a variety of puzzles and games. Most items in the 144-page book, which is organized by state, are related to travel and help introduce youngsters to geography, nature and history. The book can be purchased at many bookstores and at most A.A.A. offices. The list price is $4.95.  REPAIRING STORM DAMAGE TO VERSAILLES GARDENS     PARIS -- A stroll through the gardens of Versailles as winter approaches reveals the results of efforts by gardeners who, with the help of volunteers, soldiers and Boy Scouts, have restored some of the beauty after a devastating storm last February. Winds of 100 miles an hour took 1,300 trees, including 39 along the Tapis Vert, the main axis of the garden between the chateau and the canal.   Gaps in the walls of trees that define the major areas of the garden designed by Andre Le Notre, the landscape architect, are to be found throughout the park, but the most serious damage was done to the bosquets, openings in the wooded parts containing fountains, statues and benches. The Room of the Chestnuts was left with no chestnuts at all.   However, the debris has been carried away and 40 new trees planted. A mix of other, faster-growing trees and some hardwood varieties have been set out. These new plantings allow one to feel something of the effect of the young Versailles, evoking the appearance of the garden under Louis XIV.  The restoration work on the north side has proceeded more slowly than on the south. A substantial area is still closed to the public, and many fallen trees remain on the ground. Both Trianons also suffered important losses.   An informational exhibit has been set up by the staff of the chateau around the Basin of Apollo near the canal. It points out that this is the third time that Versailles has lost most of its old trees.    The gardens are open until dusk every day; admission is free. -- GUY WALTON Travel Advisory"},{"year":"1928","title":"Fined $10 for possession of liquor","excerpt":"30 days' sentence for selling liquor suspended by Judge Clayton Court Quotes Lord's Prayer In Scoring Police Liquor Trap"},{"year":"2007","title":"In one of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan this year, a bomber wearing an Afghan military uniform approached a bus full of Afghan soldiers and detonated a belt of explosives.

It's true that there is something radical about the success of Windham Hill, the California label that became synonymous with New Age music. (It's a term the pianist Will Ackerman, the label's founder, strongly dislikes.) The label embraced music that was smooth and sentimental and unobtrusive and often vocal-free, ranging from the piano fantasias of George Winston to the Celtic folk-pop of Nightnoise. Much of this music is -- now's the time to say it -- more boring than silence, despite the presence of a few ringers, like Cesaria Evora. But this set should please not only New Age fans but also cultural anthropologists eager for an underexamined example of how to create -- and satisfy -- an unlikely musical market.

Cooper, curator of American paintings and sculpture at the Yale Art Gallery who is responsible for this show, continues her remarks by summing up why these works are and have been so esteemed: ''Executed over a period of more than 30 years, between 1875 and 1905, these works are unsurpassed for the direct statement, luminosity and economy of means.''\\n\\nIn those works the viewer observes Homer grow both in mastery of his medium and in the depth of what he wants to say. This year is also the 150th anniversary of his birth, so the viewer is also getting a reading of American culture and mores in the country's formative years as well as the sharpening of a private vision. This unfolding is nothing short of enthralling.

By all accounts, the concert in December 1963, was an extraordinary success, and the recording of the concert, which unfortunately is rare, has some of the most beautiful moments jazz has ever committed to tape.   It's a performance in which a group of musicians perfectly interpret orchestrations that in turn interpret Monk's music with real clarity. The orchestrations, which Overton and Monk worked on, are loaded with wit, and accurate: on \\"I Mean You,\\" high riffs, played with soprano saxophone and clarinet, mimic Monk's own high-register tinkling, and the music is rife with his funny dissonances and wryness that constitute a large portion of Monk's legacy.

It's a nice concept -- but one that's often hard to pull off when you are an American tourist traveling through Europe and struggling to find ways to offset the weakness of the dollar. Here is some help: money-saving tips on everything from hotel rooms to cultural events from New York Times correspondents and contributors in 15 major European cities.       The crowds may have gone, but Athens is basking in the afterglow of its 2004 Olympics homecoming, one that comes with a hefty price tag. Not only are residents still struggling to pay off the multimillion dollar makeover, but rampant price-gouging has pushed up the cost of living -- and visiting.    Where to Eat Cheaply       Tavernas in Athens are like delis in New York -- they're everywhere, but just a handful offer delicious food at decent prices. O Platanos (Diogenous 4","excerpt":"30-210-322-0666) serves a mouthwatering giouvetsi -- lamb and pasta baked in a terra-cotta dish -- in a quaint yet authentic Greek setting, at the foot of the Acropolis under a shady plane tree. Vegetarians can feast on the taverna's assortment of platters ranging from yogurt and cucumber dip to beans soaked in a savory olive oil. A meal for two fetches around 25 euros, or $31, at $1.24 to the euro. For haute fish cuisine, venture to Varoulko (80 Piraios, 30-210-522-8400). Some of tastiest dishes here are the cheapest. The unique seafood mousaka and glasses of house wine cost less than 40 euros for two. Reservations required. Closed Sunday.    Lodging for Under 100 Euros       Many of the new boutique hotels are in the gentrified downtown neighborhoods. Hotel Eridanus (78 Piraios , 30-210-5205360; www.eridanus.gr), a five-story renovated neo-Classical house, offers great deals and breathtaking views of the Acropolis, with rooms sometimes available through agents for as low as 85 euros a night for a standard double, breakfast included. But with just 38 rooms, it has limited space. So book ahead.    Best Deal on a Cultural Event       With its mélange of cross-cultural performances at the Odeon of Herodus Atticus, near the Acropolis, the Athens Festival is the Greek capital's top cultural event. The festival kicks off in June; you can plan ahead with a sneak preview at www.hellenicfestival.gr. The cheapest tickets go for 18 euros, but be sure to bring binoculars and a cushion. Also, consult with the festival's box office (30-210-9282900) for package deals that organizers hope to introduce this year.    Best Things to Do Free       Summer arrives with a frenzy of free events in Athens. Opera divas sing at the ancient Agora, crowds clamber up the Parthenon for midsummer strolls and dancers prance amid ancient ruins until 3 a.m. Check www.cultureguide.gr or English-language newspapers like Kathimerini for a listing of these events -- which only take place on nights when there is a full moon. If your travel dates don't coincide with the phases of the moon, then venture to Lycabettus Hill, the tallest spot in Athens, for a rewarding view of the city. No need to tote binoculars up the craggy 968-foot rock. They're available at an observation deck, next to the idyllic 19th-century Chapel of St. George. Religious or not, it's customary for visitors to light a candle, kiss or just glance at the stunning fresco of St. George slaying the dragon.    Best Money-Saving Tip       Don't fall prey to money-gouging taxi drivers. Opt instead for a 10-euro transit pass that offers unlimited use of all forms of public transportation for up to a week. The pass can be bought at the Syntagma metro station, a gleaming minimuseum worth visiting even if you decide to give public transportation a pass.
