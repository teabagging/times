The day of the riot, Lin-Lang happened to be in the hospital having an abortion.

BEHAVIOR THERAPY   This approach posits that emotional and behavioral problems develop through the laws of learning -- reinforcements, punishment, conditioning, modeling and so on. Therefore, the theory goes, those problems can be treated using those same laws.   \\"This is very different from the psychodynamic or psychoanalytic approach which believes that most problems people have derive from early childhood trauma or unresolved conflict,\\" said Dr. Barry S. Lubetkin, clinical director of the Institute for Behavior Therapy in Manhattan. \\"The behavior therapist is more focused on the here and now and assumes that many problems have broken away from the original root causes, taking on a life of their own.\\"   The task of the behavior therapist is to direct patients toward activities and techniques that will help them overcome behavior problems, teaching communication assertiveness skills, as well as relaxation techniques.    One tool is called \\"systematic desensitization,\\" which is most effective in treating phobias. The patient is talked into deep relaxation, and then the therapist talks the patient through a few stages of an anxiety-producing event, such as flying, beginning with the drive to the airport and ending with takeoff.    There are homework assignments, too, usually after every session. It might be to take a colleague out to lunch if the problem is social isolation, or to ask for a promotion if the problem is assertiveness.  COGNITIVE THERAPY    This approach is concerned with perceptions, judgments and thoughts that are unfounded or unnecessarily negative and that can produce depression, phobias, obsessions, social isolation and other uncomfortable states of mind or behavior. Cognitive therapists help patients analyze and change that thinking. More and more practitioners are calling what they do cognitive-behavioral therapy, merging the two approaches.   According to Dr. Robert L. Leahy, director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy in Manhattan, people who are depressed often think of themselves as failures, predict that negative things will happen to them, blame themselves for bad events, think they must be perfect to be worthwhile and assume people don't like them.    \\"In cognitive therapy we help the patient identify the particular thinking errors that they have, and we have homework exercises they can do to change their thinking,\\" Dr. Leahy said.    A female patient of his was convinced that men didn't find her attractive. She was asked to list all the ways in which people show an interest in each other and then to record each time a man behaved in one of those ways toward her. The next assignment was to engage in the same behavior toward them. \\"In the past two years she has been averaging two dates a week,\\" he said.   Books are recommended, like David Burns's \\"Feeling Good Handbook,\\" and questionnaires measure progress.  GROUP THERAPY    Thanks to managed care, group therapy has experienced a resurgence in recent years. That's because it is cheaper","excerpt":"a therapist might charge $95 dollars for an individual session, while a group session might cost each member only $45.    \\"One of the main differences between group and individual therapy is that you see right in front of you live examples of your problems, coping mechanisms and strengths,\\" said Stephen Bendich, a Manhattan psychologist who has led groups on and off for 25 years. \\"It's a safe, controlled environment that lets you try out new behaviors. If you can't get close to people, you can try that out; if you can't assert yourself, you can try that out.\\"   Groups vary enormously. In one group the therapist might say one or two things during a session; in another, the therapist might dominate. Some groups delve into patients' pasts as part of the therapy, while others stick to the present. Some groups encourage confrontation that, when not handled sensitively by the therapist, can verge on abuse.    Group therapy, like individual therapy, allows patients to project the qualities of significant people in their lives -- usually a parent -- onto the therapist, an instructive phenomenon called \\"transference.\\" But group therapy also provides a half dozen or so others with whom to connect. Over months, and years, these interactions often start to mimic those with siblings, spouses and even colleagues.    As a 32-year-old management consultant on the Upper West Side put it: \\"It's working out family issues in a group that isn't your family. Your individual therapist is non-judgmental and careful about what she says. But in the group you get more honest feedback from your peers.\\"  FAMILY AND MARITAL THERAPY    Entering therapy with a significant other or the whole family is like continually turning a kaleidoscope a few degrees: new perspectives naturally emerge.   The kinds of problems that family and marital therapists see range from incest or domestic violence to common communication problems in marriage or a child's suddenly failing in school.   Such therapy often seeks to clarify goals and devise new ways of relating.  Say a spouse feels neglected or, in psychology-speak, unattended to, and he or she starts to complain or yell at the partner. The partner withdraws, the spouse yells louder.    \\"Before you know it, you have this repetitive cycle,\\" said Elana Katz, a family therapist and faculty member at the Ackerman Institute for Family Therapy on the Upper East Side. \\"Nobody's benefiting from that, and nothing moves forward. A lot of attention is paid in therapy to focusing on what people want and also how they're going about getting it.\\"   Usually what propels a family into therapy is a child's behavior. But often the problem rests in the parents' relationship, said Dr. Neil Maron, president of the Center for Marital and Family Therapy in New York City.   \\"In many cases the child acts out because he prefers to be the one who is the focus of the anger -- out of fear of divorce and abandonment,\\" he said. \\"As long as the child is the scapegoat, the parents do not have to deal with their own relationship. Children are extremely revealing about what's going on. They learn to manipulate their environment in order to exist.\\" FREUDIAN PSYCHOANALYSIS    There is no single approach to Freudian analysis. But whether the patient goes twice a week or five times a week, lies down or sits up, the goal is to gain insight by exploring the unconscious, the reservoir of repressed memories, thoughts and impulses.   The process is that the patient says whatever comes to mind, whether a conflict at work or a memory from age four. And the therapist listens, makes connections and occasionally, when the patient seems ready to hear it, offers an interpretation.   The process includes analyzing dreams and fantasies, as well as acts of transference and resistance, which is a patient's unwillingness to probe further.   The unconscious is a big, complex place, and, for Freudians, analysis generally lasts for years, not months.   \\"We don't promise happiness,\\" said Dr. Gerd H. Fenchel, a self-described mainstream Freudian analyst and executive director of the Washington Square Institute for Psychotherapy and Mental Health in Greenwich Village.   \\"We feel that if you understand yourself better, you are able to take charge of your life, and that's our goal,\\" he said. \\"Behavior therapy works very well with some conditions like phobias. But we feel we need a more basic restructuring of the personality, that this is more lasting and more promising. That doesn't mean the person is completely different, but it means they handle things differently.\\"   Some of Freud's psychoanalytic theories may seem overly focused on sexuality or downright bizarre. His theories include castration anxiety, penis envy and his idea that young boys and girls fall in love with the parent of the opposite sex on their way to emotional maturity.   But the topic of sex doesn't dominate psychoanalysis, Dr. Fenchel said.  \\"You'll talk about sex, money, religion and whatever you want to talk about, or whatever you don't want to talk about,\\" he said, \\"but sex will be just one of many areas.\\" JUNGIAN ANALYSIS    Some of Freud's most brilliant students and adherents formed their own schools of psychoanalysis. While all stressed the importance of the unconscious and the goal of insight, they turned away from some of Freud's basic tenets about human development and personality formation, playing down the emphasis on early sexual stages, as well as the roles of the id and libido.   Perhaps the most famous of these offshoots is Jungian analysis, also known as analytic psychology. It was developed by Carl Gustav Jung, one of Freud's star students before the two had a falling-out in 1912.   Jung believed in a collective unconscious, in universal, timeless patterns of behavior and emotions, like the archetype of the hero and the fear of darkness.    \\"It is a therapy that looks to bring in the collective unconscious from myths, fairy tales and legends,\\" said Aryeh Maidenbaum, director of the New York Center for Jungian Studies. \\"For example, people tend to want to live a heroic life, even on a personal level. They are always sacrificing. One has to understand that they are gripped by these archetypes that guide their life.\\"   There are only about 100 Jungian analysts in New York City. Typically, the therapist sees the patient once a week for anywhere from two to seven years. Dream analysis makes up a quarter to a third of the therapy.   Dr. Maidenbaum said that Jungian analysis was ideally suited for people dealing with \\"second half of life\\" and \\"transition\\" issues. \\"People reach midlife -- even people who are successful in the world -- and they begin to question: What am I up to in life?\\" he said. \\"Am I happy? I may have a career, I've started building a family, but what is it now that really gives me meaning in life?\\" Therapy, Thy Name Is Legion"},{"year":"1954","title":"C L Sulzberger on USSR propaganda use of atomic peril fears Foreign Affairs","excerpt":"A Thermonuclear Christmas and the Strategy of Terror"},{"year":"1934","title":"Thesaurus of Slang, compiled by H N Rose Mr. Whiskers\\" and Other Slang Words","excerpt":"A THESAURUS OF SLANG.

The company's research had found that when young girls who played sports were asked what they thought of when they heard the word \\"Nike,\\" they named some male athlete -- usually Michael Jordan or Charles Barkley. There was also a disturbing trend of young female basketball players buying men's shoes rather than women's. The company's concern was not for the girls' self-esteem, of course, but for its own potential profits: it feared that a booming new market would fall into the hands of a company shrewd enough to speak directly to women. So Nike quickly signed up a host of female hoopsters and even created the first basketball shoes named for a woman -- Air Swoopes, for the Olympian Sheryl Swoopes. They sold out immediately.

The brunt of the acting falls on Frederic March and Mary Brian, who are thoroughly believable in their rôles.This offering was directed by Lothar Mendes, who would have embellished his scenes considerably had he not photographed all of them within the studio doors. It is far more effective to see the real sunshine, the real sands, with a real breeze fanning a seaside resort, such as the Lido, rather than to gaze upon an obviously artificially lighted patch of sand with a sky that is all too near. Mr. Mendes, however, has done far better by this tale of quarreling parents and their mixed brood than he has with other pictures. He has succeeded in eliciting a diversity of natures from the seven youngsters, the oldest of whom is Judith Wheater, played by Mary Brian. If one thinks that these children are exaggerated types, one may ponder that it may after all be the result of their upbringing and the reckless conduct of their parents. Mr. and Mrs. Wheater have been divorced and re-married to each other. The seven neglected offsprings have different parents, but they all love each other and do not want to be separated.Judith, with the help of a faithful nurse, Miss Scopy, cares for the six boys, girls and an infant. Mr. and Mrs. Wheater's second marriage is far from happy and Judith as well as the other youngsters are always terribly afraid that the hectic lives of their parents or step-parents, as the case may be, may lead to their being sent to different homes. As it is, they go from pillar to post on European sands.A sympathetic soul appears on the horizon in the shape of Martin Boyne, who encounters Judith and her sextet at the Lido. To her gratification she discovers that Mr. Boyne knew her father in Europe. Boyne soon is like a big brother to the six, but Judith, who is getting on for 18, has her own idea about him. Even a 10-year-old girl looks forward to matrimony with somebody and it could not be any one better than Martin, as they call him.Unfortunately, however, for these youngsters and particularly for Judith, Martin is engaged to marry Rose Sellers, who lives with her philosophic, white-haired aunt. Martin delays going to his fiancée, who happens to be in Switzerland, much to Rose's annoyance. Rose had been married once before, and one concludes that she is lucky indeed to have inveigled Martin into proposing to her. One also is impelled to think that Martin is not as bright as he seems to be or he would not have fallen in love with Rose.There are a number of scenes in which pathos and humor are mingled. One of the children is impudent, another is coy","excerpt":"a third, a boy, is getting beyond Judith's control. In one episode one perceives the youngsters lined up at the side of a bathtub filled with water and two or three of the youngsters are taking their turns at trying to see how long they can keep their heads under water. Victory means a lot to them in this sport. The affection developed by these children for Martin is charming.Lilyan Tashman is sure enough of herself in the part of Mrs. Wheater, but more often than not she makes the grievous error of reciting rather than talking. Huntly Gordon does well as Mr. Wheater and William Austin delivers some amusement as an English lord. Maude Turner Gordon is splendid as Rose's elderly aunt. Seena Owen is capital as Martin's fretting fiancée and Master Philippe de Lacy does intelligent acting as the oldest boy of the heterogeneous flock.Ruby Keeler Jolson is appearing in the Paramount's stage attraction, \\"Ingenues' Gambol,\\" which was staged by Boris Petroff.

It is a particular kind of anger -- the anger of people who have been too long at war, who for the first time were letting themselves believe that the future was about to bury the past, only to have the past come roaring back and smack them in the face. When I asked Senator Edward Kennedy -- who helped open the dialogue between Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing, and the U.S. -- for his thoughts now, he declared: \\"The I.R.A. are no friends of Ireland. They are enemies of peace. No amount of I.R.A. rationalizing or dissembling can possibly justify their continuation of violence.\\"         That anger is healthy. The more the better. Pile it on. Let 'er rip. It's the only thing that can save the Irish peace process. Because that anger is a reaffirmation that the vast majority of Irish Catholics in this country, and in  Belfast, believe in the cease-fire -- which held for 17 months before the I.R.A. broke it on Feb. 9 -- and want to see it restored and made permanent. The I.R.A. gunmen need to taste that anger, they need to be confronted daily and ferociously with how much they are operating against the tide of their community, most of which believes the war is over. As a pro-I.R.A. city official in Belfast told a friend of mine there last week: \\"The one absolute truth here now is that nobody believes there is an advantage to war. They might have believed it before, but there is no conviction now. They will go along with it out of family ties, history and so on, but how long can you sustain a war if you don't believe in it?\\"    Foreign Affairs","excerpt":"A Time For Anger"},{"year":"1986","title":"EVEN with appearances by internationally acclaimed acting companies, there may be almost as much drama behind the scenes as on the stage this year when Pepsico's Summerfare opens its seventh season July 11 at the State University of New York at Purchase.

Even by papal standards, it was a vast assembly -- the biggest, the Vatican said, the Pope had ever seen.    More important than the numbers, though, was the remarkable boost it gave the Pope and his belief that, in a world that has broken free of moral moorings, there is a profound yearning, particularly among the young, for firm guidelines and spiritual renewal.

Yet the synchronization with the lip movements is accomplished quite ingeniously. Czar Nickolai I, in the days of 1853, is impersonated by Fritz Alberty, but the voice evidently belongs to somebody else and at times it seems as though this ruler was suffering from hay fever. This Czar has a handsome wife named Nedidowa, but he becomes very much interested in a dancer named Saira, who happens to be Hadschi Murat's sweetheart. Murat is a Cossack, impersonated by Ivan Mosjoukine, but his uniforms appear to be more suited for musical comedies than for fighting. He is a widower and he promises his little boy a new mother. He does not fail the child, for in the end, after all sorts of difficulties, he defies the Czar and marries Saira.The Czar's wife, played by Lil Dagover, evidently suspects him of being a philanderer and she interrupts his tête-à-tête with Saira, much to the latter's relief.There are some fine scenes of Russian troops on the mountain passes and others depicting the crafty, attack on them by Murat's dashing Cossacks.

Boyle's natural color travelogue, \\"Sweden, Land of the Vikings,\\" which is the chief attraction at the little Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse. It is a full-length feature and the discriminating fashion in which the scenes have been photographed will undoubtedly win high favor from those who have not been able to visit Sweden, and those who have been there will find glimpses that will probably recall a pleasant journey.It is a film done in an effortless manner and its illuminating visions are always beguiling. Mr. Boyle has avoided anything that savors of the stereotyped and he has assembled his scenes so that the footage is just enough and no more. It is a pity, however, that Wilfred Lucas, who gives a running comment on the picture, so often slumps into silly wisecracking and unnecessary slang. The film is too nice for flip and sorry attempts at humor. Mr. Lucas, however, atones partly for his bromidic utterances by much well-spoken information.From the scenes aboard a Swedish liner, revealing the games and other activities of the passengers, to the adieu to the land of the Vikings, this feature compels attention. The prismatic effects, obtained through the Cinecolor Process, enhance the worth of the production, particularly in those scenes pictured in a bright sunlight. Others are not so clear.After the landing in Sweden, the picture offers views of Goteborg, Saro and Marstrand and of a trip up the Gota Canal. Then the travelers reach Stockholm, with interesting aspects of life there. Mr. Lucas expatiates upon the lack of noise and the cleanliness of the city. The film, however, is a silent one, except for the lecture and the occasional musical accompaniment.An appealing series of scenes is that devoted to the Isle of Gotland, where the people appear in costumes of the twelfth century for a pageant. After further views of this isle of \\"roses and ruins,\\" Mr. Boyle takes one back to beautiful Stockholm and from there on an electric train bound for Goteborg. He shows the accommodations on this fast train and just before the film's end he depicts the launching of the Swedish motor liner Kungsholm.It is a screen journey worthy of any one's attention and one that is free from any dull moments.

One of the most memorable is Jessie Matthews's frothy, swirling solo performance of Rodgers and  Hart's \\"Dancing on the Ceiling\\" in the 1934 movie musical \\"Evergreen.\\" In this gauzy boudoir reverie, the English musical-comedy star deliriously gives herself over to a fantasy of an elusive dream lover who visits her at night as she spins through an immaculate white-on-white English country cottage.         Matthews, an enchanting dancer and singer, who resembled a cross between Clara Bow and Liza Minnelli, is being remembered in a six-film retrospective, \\"Jessie Matthews: England's 'Dancing Divinity,' \\" at the Walter Reade Theater, which starts on Sunday and runs through Thursday. With her heart-shaped face and slightly goofy smile, Matthews epitomized a glamorous Depression-era flapper with a streak of innocent mischief. In \\"Evergreen,\\" directed by Victor Saville,  she plays the daughter of a famous retired vaudeville star who is talked into impersonating her mother by an ambitious publicity agent.

A good many producers are obviously convinced that the nation needs a laugh (get a load of next season's sitcom glut) and the uses of the past are getting more ornate. On the Comedy Central cable service, for instance, \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\" lets the comedian Joel Hodgson and his robotic friends watch some of the worst movies ever made, in their entirety, and simply make endless wisecracks about the content.

The newest production of Tada, the children's theater ensemble, provides a few subway scenarios, enough to confirm a child's most vivid imaginings. The hourlong musical, which is spun together with a wonderful collection of songs and heartfelt acting, is written by Jon Agee, the author of, among other books, \\"The Incredible Painting of Felix Clousseau.\\" Beginning with a mysterious and evocative song (and accompanied by a felicitous jazz ensemble), this modern play introduces two young, well-off Upper East Siders","excerpt":"a trio of young Buffalo tourists, and a pair of young streetwise but friendly New Yorkers.

All the children become lost (it's never quite clear why), and in their meanderings come upon a rat who paints soulful still lifes of cheeses; mummies from Egypt who tap dance, and an organization, run by children, called Botch, the Bureau of Turmoil, Chaos and Headaches. The bureau is responsible for disasters like floods and power failures; for example, the sassy dispatcher takes a call to short-circuit a water main. All in a day's work.

The guidebooks, squeeze-boxes of history, record that Louis didn't get back to Chambord very often; by the early 1700's, they say, the Loire Valley, after centuries of glory, was in decline: no more mock naval battles between the sand bars, no more buffets of pigs' snouts and sweetmeats, no more peregrinations by barge from chateau to chateau. The stonework chipped, the pennants faded; tourists came. Someone named Arthur Young, who wrote ''Travels in France'' in 1792, reported that the valley's roads were good. Henry James, who was through about a hundred years later, found Chambord, its 440 abandoned rooms, its intricateness, oddly touching. In ''A Little Tour in France'' he described hearing the chateau talking, ''with a muffled but audible voice, of the vanished monarchy, which had been so strong, so splendid, but today has become a sort of fantastic vision.'' ROYAL MEANDER ALONG THE LOIRE"},{"year":"1931","title":"James Whale, who directed several stage companies of \\"Journey's End\\" and who was also responsible for the film of that memorable contribution, has fashioned a praiseworthy picture from Robert Emmet Sherwood's play. \\"Waterloo Bridge.\\" This screen offering, which is now at the Mayfair, is somewhat sketchy in substance, but it is acted cleverly and there is imagination in the employment of the camera and the microphone.It might have been even a more satisfactory production had Mr. Whale had full say as to the dialogue, for the lines from some of the cockney characters are occasionally a little forced. The whole narrative is an attenuated short story, with the result that parts of it are not especially interesting. It is bound to recall \\"The Shopworn Angel,\\" for its theme is concerned with the love of an American, a private in the British Army, for a demi-mondaine he encounters first on Waterloo Bridge. It never occurs to the soldier, Roy Cronin, that Myra, the girl, who is also an American, is unworthy of his affection. He is 19 and impressionable. She is perhaps older, certainly in the ways of the world.Private Cronin takes Myra for an automobile ride. He dares not tell her that he intends escorting her to his well-to-do family in the country, fearing that she will refuse to accompany him. When they are near the estate of his stepfather, Mr. Wetherby, he suggests that they go and see his people. Myra consents and soon she finds herself with Roy in the spacious house. Mr. Wetherby, who is rather deaf, patronizes Myra and, in the course of his talk with her, he evinces a great admiration for any one gifted with histrionic talent.Most heroines of Myra's type are unusual and Myra is no exception. She tells Roy's mother that she is a chorus girl out of work who has fallen to selling her favors. To the gentle Mrs. Wetherby's satisfaction Myra appreciates the hopelessness of becoming Roy's wife.The ending is worked out in rather a different way to what it was in the play. It is quite dramatic, but leaves the young soldier going forth to the battlefield, still clinging to his love for Myra, although he has by that time learned of her belonging to the bedizened tribe.There are several views of London being bombed, some of which are quite good while others are exaggerated. Considering the scarcity of opportunities, Mr. Whale has done excellent work on this film, which is his second attempt at motion-picture direction. To impress one with the idea that Roy and Myra are in the country, this British director gives familiar farmyard noises, such as the crowing of a rooster and the mooing of a cow. When the soldier and the girl are in her dismal abode, one hears the vaguest suggestion of a regimental band passing in a distant thoroughfare. After the bombing raid is over the \\"all clear\\" signal is heard, but it is rather surprising to observe that Mr. Whale causes the blinds to be pulled up, which was not permitted. That, however, is of small importance.Mae Clarke's acting of Myra is capital. Kent Douglass also does splendid work as Roy. Frederic Kerr makes the most of his part, that of Mr. Wetherby.

When the troubled bank stopped maintenance payments on its foreclosed units shortly before it failed two years ago, the board collected rents from tenants in the 56 occupied units.\\n\\nThe struggle continues. The board hopes to strike a deal with the Resolution Trust Company, the Federal agency charged with selling off the assets of the nation's failed thrift institutions. Under the deal, the R.T.C, which has taken over Ensign Bank, would relinguish any claim to the unsold units, leaving the board free to rent or sell them. A decision is expected by the end of the month, said Mabel M. Torreggiani, board president at Harrison Park Tower.\\n\\n\\"It was a matter of either managing our own finances or walking away from the problem,\\" said Mrs. Torreggiani. To the board, she said, the choice was clear.\\n\\nEfforts like the East Orange co-op's to regain fiscal health are being made in owner communities all across New Jersey. The accountants, lawyers and managing agents who work with homeowner groups as well as with banks, say such steps are necessary -- particularly in cases of defaults by sponsors and owners -- to keep projects viable and maintain property values until the market recovers.\\n\\nUnder state law, the bank is responsible only for maintenance charges following a sponsor's default, not those that preceded it, said Benjamin Lambert, a Woodbridge lawyer specializing in condominium and co-op matters. But no court has tested, he added, what other elements of the sponsor's debts the bank must pay. \\n\\nThe key for homeowners to successfully weather a financial storm, Mr. Lambert and others said, is negotiating aggressively with sponsors or banks for relief.\\n\\nThat was the thinking of homeowners at Atlantic Hills in Manahawkin, an adult community that was to have 259 detached one-family homes. A total of 92 were built when the developer defaulted on his loan from National Westminister Bank of Jersey City in 1989. Following the default, services began to decline.\\n\\nThat prompted the homeowners in the 77 occupied houses to band together and temporarily take over some maintenance duties, like mowing the common lawns, to preserve their investment, said Jerry Fitzgerald, a board member. He said they also placed their maintenance fees in an escrow account \\"because we weren't sure where our money was going.\\"\\n\\n\\"The project was in financial limbo,\\" said Roy F. Minieri, president of Eastern Community Management Company in Red Bank, which is working with the bank and homeowners to stabilize the first phase of the project. Since the bank took over in April 1989 at a sheriff's sale, it has paid maintenance charges on the 15 unsold units and is searching for a developer to build the remaining houses.\\n\\nTHERE are several reasons for the current climate. Owners and sponsors, caught in a financial squeeze by the recession, are falling behind on mortgage payments or maintenance charges on unsold units at their projects. And where the situation has worsened, payments are withheld, often resulting in a default, bankruptcy or foreclosure. In other cases, the sponsors are finding it increasingly hard to sell units at the pace or price they counted on.\\n\\nHow many projects are under financial strain is uncertain since the state doesn't monitor their fiscal stability. A task force of state officials, lawyers, association representatives and developers is assessing the extent of the problem and the need for additional regulation.\\n\\nThe New Jersey Chapter of the Community Associations Institute, a nonprofit group of condominium and co-op owners, based in Pennington, considered the situation worrisome enough to dedicate a recent membership seminar to the issue of owner insolvency, said Gary Rosen, the chapter's incoming president.\\n\\nTo start a project on its road to recovery a new budget should be drafted to replace an existing one that often has been kept artifically low to keep maintenance fees attractive to potential buyers, said Mr. Rosen, who is also a partner at an East Brunswick accounting firm that works with over 450 condominium and co-op association in the state. \\n\\n\\"AS a result, monthly maintenance fees generally have to be raised to meet operating deficits and maintain the project,\\" said Mr. Rosen. His firm, along with C & R Realty and Management Company of Teaneck, was among the professionals the board at Harrison Park Tower called in to straighten out its financial affairs.\\n\\nThere, the maintenance fees went to $25 a share from $23 three years ago. At Atlantic Hills the monthly common charges were increased by $53, to $91. Depending on the circumstances, that money may be recouped when the project is back on solid footing, lawyers said.\\n\\nUnder New Jersey law, 75 percent of the units must be sold before residents can take control of the board. But E. Richard Kennedy, a Montville lawyer, said the transition can happen sooner if, for example, the sponsor voluntarily gives up control. \\n\\nAlso, if units are not being sold, he said, residents can petition the state's Office of Planned Real Estate Development, which administers the law, to gain control. A petition might succeed, said Mr. Kennedy, if a board could prove that units were not being properly marketed.\\n\\nAmong other ways for homeowner groups to stave off additional financial hardship are placing liens on a defaulted sponsor's unsold units, eliminating an amenity or turning one into an income generator by renting it out, or exploring commercial ventures toproduce extra revenue. \\n\\nThe board of Harrison Park Tower, for instance, wants to rent roof space on its 21-story building to mobile-antenna companies. Mr. Rosen said the building, converted from a rental in 1982, is expected to be totally debt free by 1994.\\n\\n\\"By banding together,\\" said Charles Chamberlain, the board's vice president, \\"we have been able to turn the building around.\\" In the Region: New Jersey","excerpt":"A Troubled Co-op's Struggle for Survival"},{"year":"1968","title":"cartoon Britain","excerpt":"A Troubled Country Grapples With Racism"},{"year":"1965","title":"THE Hodges brothers from Lake Forest, Ill., Alex, 14 years old, and Hank, 12, were soaked to the skin by the heavy rain and they were up past their bedtime.

Exactly what this means is spelled out for us by Harry Rand, the curator and chairman of the museum's department of 20th-century painting and sculpture, in his introduction to the catalogue of the current exhibition called ''Recent Trends in Collecting'' (through March 28). At a time when museums are once again being urged to sell off works of their own collections in order to pay for new acquisitions or to meet increased costs, Mr. Rand's words are worth pondering.   At the National Museum, Mr. Rand reports, ''Nothing is deaccessioned. Rather than pruning the collections to center on a handful of representative 'masterpieces,' a wide range of art is acquired and kept. This concept is part of the sustaining mandate of a museum of record. Not all museums choose to assume this special role - and it is probably not a role suited to the temperament, pace and longevity of many institutions. A museum of record takes the impression of the times, holds it, and reflects back to succeeding spectators a complete set of characteristics, including those that were once popular but are no longer.''

The tune ripped apart at the seams, leaving each segment alone and relying on the drummer's swing, which couldn't be found, or on the ability of the others to improvise, which was none to reliable. And Mr. Hall's natural sound has been distorted by his use of harmonizing electronic effects, making his playing seem clumsy.

The freshly widowed Bernarda, wielding tyrannical control over her five unmarried daughters, virtually shuts her house to the outside world, even as her shrewd old housekeeper warns that \\"there's a storm brewing in every room and the day it breaks we'll all be swept away.\\" The scene is a small church-dominated Spanish village, not far from Granada. The fates of the characters are unalterable.   Garcia Lorca wrote the play in 1936, shortly before he was executed by Franco's fascists. In exploring the explosive ramifications of sexual repression, the poet was also obviously alluding to the dangers of political and cultural suppression. The play has the ferocious intensity of white heat. In 1986, Nuria Espert, Spain's distinguished interpreter of Garcia Lorca, directed a London version of \\"Bernarda Alba\\" starring Glenda Jackson and Joan Plowright. That acclaimed production, with the same two stars, has now been adapted for television by the director Stuart Burge (\\"The Rainbow\\").

The main facades, dating from the 16th through the 19th centuries, have been largely scrubbed clean and restored over the past two years. Workers have removed grime and repaired cracks and chips in dozens of mythological figures, the nymphs and animals that are set in bas-relief along the courtyard walls.   Inside, craftsmen have nearly finished work on the 18th- and 19th-century ceilings and repaired the first floor's overhead reliefs and paintings. But above all, to prepare for 39 new rooms added to the Louvre's exhibition space, workshops here and at Versailles have restored more than 100 paintings and over 300 frames, many of which had spent much of their lives in storage for lack of room. The relining, stretching and cleaning have taken more than four years. Some exceptionally large works, like Jean Restout's \\"Pentecost\\" (7.78 by 4.65 meters, or 25.5 by 15.2 feet) have taken almost three years on their own. 5 Pieces of Europe's Past Return to Life: France","excerpt":"A vast new exhibition space as the Louvre renovates"},{"year":"1964","title":"The New Jersey Turnpike Authority was criticized yesterday for developing a plan that would funnel &#8220","excerpt":"a vast new river of traffic&#8221; into New.

Although an appreciation of the city informs every part of the movie, Rome is not so much the subject as the occasion for a film that is not quite fiction and surely not fact, but rather the celebration of an imaginative collaboration full of love and awe, suspicion, admiration, exasperation and a measure of well-qualified respect.It is also, for me, the most enjoyable Fellini in a dozen years, the most surprising, the most exuberant, the most beautiful, the most extravagantly theatrical. The audience I saw it with kept interrupting the film with applause. This isn't something you normally do at the movies, but it seems proper enough for \\"Fellini's Roma.\\"It is altogether typical of Fellini that he should film his \\"Roma,\\" his tribute to a great city, mostly indoors on a sound stage. When he does go outside, he treats the very streets as a sound stage, with unreal lights and shadows playing over the facades.Or he turns to the process of his own filmmaking, to introduce a further element of the fantastic into a landscape that might already seem fantastic enough. Thus, in a sequence showing the Raccordo Anulare, a great highway skirting Rome, jammed with traffic in a stormy twilight, the subject becomes the camera crane itself, with its spotlights, its plastic rainshield flapping wildly in the wind, like some extraordinary, swooping, probing monster.\\"Fellini's Roma\\" begins with the young Fellini in the north, in Rimini, first learning about Rome in school, from friends or from conversations overheard in taverns. It follows Fellini as a young man (played by Peter Gonzales) in his introduction to the city at the beginning of World War II, and then it continues in more or less self-contained sequences, shifting back and forth between the present and the not-so-distant past. Fellini, the real Fellini, makes a brief appearance, and there are celebrity spots for Gore Vidal and Anna Magnani (a bad idea), but mostly we are in the presence of what excites the director's imagination and his mind.That mind, whether you portant phenomenon of contemporary filmmaking, and \\"Roma\\" gives it a kind of freedom I have seen in no other Fellini movie. Its capacities for pleasure and terror, for sympathy and irony, are all perfectly met in \\"Roma,\\" where, for example, a strange conceit called an Ecclesiastical Fashion Show begins with roller-skating priests (\\"They move faster to Paradise\\") and ends with a marvelously delicate, intricate, heraldic float constructed of human skeletons; or where the waiting room of any brothel (there are two, a fancy one and a poor one) seems a teeming antechamber to heaven's portal or hell's gate. It is as if Rome in the 20th century were the last great expression of the late Middle Ages.But there is also the ancient world and its modern counterparts, and perhaps no other image in the film really matches one brief glimpse of a monumental Fellini whore standing in the midst of fallen stone heads and torsos, no more permanent or wonderful than she, in a rain-driven field outside Rome.Yet there is another image, a face, a fresco at the bottom of a shallow pool of clear water, parl of an ancient Roman villa uncovered in subway excavations (this is all artifice) explored by the Fellini production crew.What matters is not the face itself, but the sense of wonder that Fellini not only offers but also shares, as if that were why he makes movies in the first place. I suspect that is why there are so many journeys of discovery—a short ride, a walk into the past or another world — in Fellini's work; and why \\"Roma,\\" which is almost wholly a journey of discovery, seems so richly to epitomize his career.\\"Fellini's Roma\\" opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld Theater.

He wrote books and essays on Plato, Spinoza, Xenophon and Maimonides, and these writings contain nary a sentence about current events or public policy.   And yet, the German born scholar, who came to the United States in 1938 and died in 1973, has suddenly, with the watershed November elections, loomed up almost larger than life as the great champion of conservatives in the hurly burly of current politics -- and as a villain to liberals. He has been cited in the past as the invisible, posthumous inspiration of an influential group of former students and other followers known as Straussians, a group that includes Robert Bork, the legal scholar and former judge, and Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court, as well as former Education Secretary William Bennett and William Kristol, now regarded as the leading theoretician of conservative Republicans. Embraced by prominent conservatives in the context of the 1994 campaign, the ghost of Professor Strauss emerged from his cloister transformed, now a sort of intellectual godfather to the Contract With America.

Dressing for such trips at this time of year is a challenge, for one could encounter rain, snow or warm sunshine. In spring, summer and fall, overnight trips require additional equipment. Presently, hiking boots or good walking shoes and warm clothing are essential, and it is always a good idea to bring rain gear.

The youngest person ever to be included in a Whitney Biennial, the 19-year-old Ms. Benning is becoming famous for her singular, offhand way with videotape, on which she has captured the unfolding of her own adolescence. \\"It Wasn't Love,\\" her tape at the current Biennial, is a cryptic, romantic tale of a flirtation between two women.   It all started about four years ago when she was 15 and received a toy video camera for Christmas from her father, the experimental film maker James Benning, himself a veteran of five biennials. A week later, after a harrowing New Year's Eve (a friend was hit by a car and there was a shooting in her Milwaukee neighborhood), Ms. Benning found herself home alone and needing to talk. She turned to the camera, liking the fact that \\"it didn't judge me -- it just sat there and recorded what I said.\\" She started spending a lot of time in her room, not writing in a diary or musing before the mirror the way many adolescents do, but using the camera as a kind of diary-mirror.

An exciting survey of more than 70 structures -- from hotels to factories -- produced by what amounts to a thriving school of young architects working in the Austrian provinces of Tirol and Vorarlberg. Their historical pedigree reaches back to the International Style and the Bauhaus but has been relaxed by postmodernism and inspired by recent advances in building materials, techniques and systems. Nothing helps the new Alpine architecture like the grandeur of the old Alpine landscape, but this show confirms the point so often lost on American builders: that elegance, sustainability, innovation and respect for the environment are not antithetical. A show within a show of 40 residences by the same architects reflects more intimate applications of their ideas. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Roberta Smith).    ''THE BISHOP JADES,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through January 2006. Jade has always been imbued with moral and spiritual meaning in China. Luminous and quick to warm to the touch, it must have seemed heaven sent when first discovered, embedded in boulders washed down from mountains in Central Asia. Yet because it is unusually hard, direct carving was all but impossible. Slow abrasion was the only way to manipulate it. It has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. They range in size from two-inch-high figurines of astrological creatures to a hefty green basin modeled on an even larger one made for Kublai Khan. Also included are jade versions of archaic bronzes, a reminder of the fundamental conservatism of Chinese art, and examples of Indian Mughal jades of a kind Qing connoisseurs flipped over. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Holland Cotter).    * ''COLONIAL ANDES: TAPESTRIES AND SILVERWORK, 1530-1830,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Dec. 12. This sumptuous, groundbreaking show examines the fruitful cultural collision triggered by the Spanish conquest of the highly developed Incan empire, in 1532. Their forced mixing resulted in a third hybrid culture that reached its zenith in two indigenous crafts: metalwork and, especially, tapestry weaving, which the Andean people had perfected over 100 years. Beginning with the gorgeously geometric pre-Colonial tunics and mantels worn by the Inca elite, this exhibition traces the progressive absorption and adjustment of Renaissance and Baroque styles from Europe. The silverwork has an astounding roiling energy that seems to reflect the metal's abundance. Hours and admission: see above (Smith).    * ''DESIGN IS NOT ART: FUNCTIONAL OBJECTS FROM DONALD JUDD TO RACHEL WHITEREAD,'' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This bracingly contentious but spatially challenged and cursory show is worth seeing, if only because it is the first in an American museum to survey the functional and semifunctional objects designed during the last three decades by artists, in this case 18 well-known Minimalists, post-Minimalists and post-post-Minimalists. The show is overdue, which also makes it seem late, as it ignores many younger artists. It also resembles a high-end home furnishings store. Points of interest are few: Richard Tuttle's lamps, John Chamberlain's carved foam couch, Joel Shapiro's side tables, crystal tumblers by Sol LeWitt and, above all, Franz West's decorate-it-yourself table and chairs. The only designs that seem likely to last are those of Donald Judd, who presides over the exhibition as Picasso would over a survey of Cubism. By default the show reminds us that design is a pressing social issue, which makes it slightly revolting to see successful artists indulge themselves at society's expense. Hours: Tuesdays to Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7 (Smith).    * ''ANDY GOLDSWORTHY ON THE ROOF,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500, through Oct. 31. ''Stone Houses,'' Mr. Goldsworthy's two-room sculpture with spectacular park views is the Met's first foray into site-specific art -- the Temple of Dendur notwithstanding. Paradoxically, the piece is more conventionally portable and object-oriented than the ephemeral, seamless fusions of natural settings and materials for which Mr. Goldsworthy, a maverick magician and a consummate popularizer of radical sculptural ideas, is best known. The work consists of two stone cairns, each enclosed within and only partly visible through a rough split-rail wood beehive dome 24 feet in diameter. Nearly 15 feet tall and ingeniously balanced, the cairns are ditsy, teetering presences, at once alien and comic. They have some of the Goldsworthian trompe l'oeil magic, but not enough to distinguish the work as a whole from the ever-expanding genre of rustic, semifigurative sculpture. Mr. Goldsworthy is more original as a popularizing rogue, whose work is one of the art world's unacknowledged guilty pleasures. Hours and admission: see above (Smith).    * ''IN THE REALM OF GODS AND KINGS: ART OF INDIA, SELECTIONS FROM THE POLSKY COLLECTIONS AND THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART,'' through Jan. 2, and ''WHEN GOLD BLOSSOMS: INDIAN JEWELRY FROM THE SUSAN L. BENINGSON COLLECTION,'' through Jan. 23, Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400. Of these two collection shows, ''In the Realm of Gods and Kings'' is the more varied. Made up mostly of small, precious objects, it leaps from from ancient sculpure to contemporary photography, but concentrates on miniature paintings from the 16th through 19th centuries. It's a visually stunning, speeded-up trip through a high-end version of Indian art, and intellectually stimulating as a demonstration of how social and spiritual worlds can reflect each other. The jewelry in the Beningson show furthers this idea with awesome amounts of razzle and dazzle. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; 65+, $7; students, $5; under 16, free (Cotter)    ''MASTERPIECES OF AMERICAN JEWELRY,'' American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, through Jan. 23. A production of the National Jewelry Institute, this exhibition presents about 150 pieces of exquisite high-quality jewelry from the late 18th century to the late 20th century. Its organization is less than illuminating but individual pieces are marvelous. Included are a Walt Disney Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs charm bracelet; gold nut-and-bolt cufflinks by the witty designer Paul Flato; a diamond, ruby and sapphire American flag brooch the size of a playing card, by Tiffany; and opulent necklaces, bracelets and brooches in various traditional styles from Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and other famous firms. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; students and 62+, $7 (Johnson).    * ''MEMORIALS OF WAR,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Nov. 28. The Whitney reveals a little-seen aspect of its collection and some interesting new acquisitions in this small but powerful show of works inspired by the war in Vietnam. Vic Muniz's recent photographs are ghostly recreations of three of the era's most indelible news photographs. Edward Kienholz and Robert Morris are represented by proposals from around 1970 for unexecuted memorials that emphasize the hard truths of armed combat. Chris Burden restages five of America's ''Darker Moments,'' in tableaus whose toy-soldier scale in no way diminishes shocks and aftershocks of these events. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Smith).    PETER RUTA, ''Picturing New York,'' Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, through Oct. 11. This show presents Manhattan cityscapes from four decades, by an octogenarian artist who paints the West Village waterfront and lower New York skyline from direct observation. Mr. Ruta's pictures reduce the city to its geometric essentials. Earlier works have a more hard-edged emphasis on structure and contrasts of light and shadow; later ones tend to a softer focus and pastel colors. Throughout, there persists a Platonic dream of well-ordered complexity. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $7; children, students and 62+, $5 (Johnson).    ''SEAMAN SCHEPPS: A CENTURY OF NEW YORK JEWELRY DESIGN,'' Museum of Arts and Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, through Jan. 2. Born and reared poor on the Lower East Side, Schepps became a wealthy Upper East Side jeweler for the rich and famous. His heyday was the 1940's and 50's, when the style was for big and bold jewels. Today his brooch, necklace and bracelet designs, using large, colorful cabochon stones, often in seemingly random compositions, look gaudy and clunky; but retro-minded viewers may enjoy their garish vitality. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; students and 65+, $6 (Johnson).    * ''TOOLS OF HER MINISTRY: THE ART OF SISTER GERTRUDE MORGAN,'' American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, through Oct. 10. If you wonder what it really means to say that art is a calling, see this ethereal show. A self-appointed prophet and street preacher, Sister Gertrude was called by God to paint in the 1950's. Untutored but full of an uncanny grace, her vivid, high-key works have a plain-spoken ecstasy and inborn eloquence, both formal and literary, that can lift the soul. The mix of text and image relates to many modern artists and poets, none of whom she ever heard of or cared about. Her pictures are talismans of mystical devotion derived from inner necessity, conceived as teaching tools for lost souls. In heaven works like these would be eternally before our eyes. The world not being heaven, this is your opportunity to see them. The day has come, as Sister Gertrude might say. Hours and admission: see above (Michael Kimmelman).    * VASEMANIA: NEOCLASSICAL FORM AND ORNAMENT: SELECTIONS FROM THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART, Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, through Oct. 17. This crystalline, elegantly installed exhibition outlines a tale of artistic osmosis, assimilation and transformation: the wide and complex swath that the Greek vase, as both object and motif, cut through the culture of 17th-century Europe. The influence of the vase echoes through silver wine coolers and coffee pots, painted overdoor panels, the inlaid decorations of a lady's desk and prints that satirize the rage for things classical. But the most exciting elements are the actual Greek vases themselves and the European ones they inspired, beginning with Josiah Wedgwood's innovative, relatively austere jasperware and including the full-blown extravagance of the royal French porcelain works at Sèvres. The show is the first collaboration between the students at the Bard Graduate Center and the Met's formidable European decorative arts department. It should become a regular habit. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $3; students and 65+, $2 (Smith).    Galleries: Uptown    * BEN NICHOLSON, Jacobson Howard, 19 East 76th Street, (212) 570-2362, through Oct. 23. The best pieces in this show of paintings and drawings by one of the best painters to emerge in England between the World Wars are a half-dozen Cubist-style pictures from the 1940's and 50's. They are notable for their exquisite draftsmanship, suave colors, delicately tactile surfaces and lively, syncopated play with flat shapes and planar layering (Johnson).    Galleries: 57th Street    PETER GREAVES, ''Reverie,'' Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 355-4545, through Oct. 23. Mr. Greaves's miniature portraits of attractive young women, each a bit larger than a postage stamp, are marvels of fastidious technique. With a slightly hazy focus and not a single visible stroke of pencil or brush, his tiny, pensive heads seem to emerge as if conjured by sorcery from the dark backgrounds (Johnson).    PAUL HENRY RAMIREZ, ''In Fluent Form,'' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, through Oct. 23. The stylized parsings of the body in these impeccably mannered canvases are accomplished by dividing flat, pristine white grounds with arrangements of thin vertical and horizaontal lines, often rooted in rounded blocks of brilliant color. The lines support bright, fleshy blobs in candy hues and occasionally end in hearts that flower into symmetrical bursts of wiry, wiglike curls. Elegant splatters of drops in the shape of eyeballs dance cheerily around these conceits. The high-finish paint surface is nothing short of perfection. The body as an 18th-century drawing room or a Vivaldi composition might work as a description of these pretty but sterile paintings (Grace Glueck).    LUCY WILLIAMS, ''Stranger than Paradise,'' McKee, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 688-5951, through Oct. 9. This young London-based artist constructs compact pictures of generic architectural subjects like low modernist buildings, swimming pools and restaurant interiors. Looking closely you discover that they are actually low-relief sculptures made of carefully cut paper, fabric, cardboard, transparent plastic and other materials. The tension between the physical facts and the pictorial illusion is arresting (Johnson).    Galleries: SoHo    ''TALESPINNING: SELECTIONS FALL 2004,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through Oct. 23. The work of 14 artists whose imagery flirts with narrative in one way or another fills this wide-ranging show, which exposes some intriguing talents. Some manipulate texts and even whole books; others play with fairy tales and folklore; still others base figments on literary characters and a few address social, political and other worldly topics. It all adds up to an uneven show, but one in the center's tradition of invigorating experiment (Glueck).    Galleries: Chelsea    BRIAN CALVIN, Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, through Oct. 16. The slender, hip young people that Mr. Calvin paints look as if they were lifted from a teenage cartoonist's sketchbook. They have comically long faces, oversize heads, huge lips, stringy hair, big eyes with reflections carefully noted, and vacant, vaguely depressed expressions. Cropped and simplified as they are, his canvases appear to both emulate and parody the styles of Alex Katz and David Hockney. It's amusing, but you wish he would give his inactive characters more to do (Johnson).    DANIEL HESIDENCE, Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 675-7772, through Oct. 9. Most of Mr. Hesidence's interesting, out-there new paintings are abstract, with vaporous whirlpools of color swirling over a misty ground. A few, though, collectively called ''Farm Paintings,'' offer specific images. One depicts a horse, or rather the hind quarters of one; the front of the body seems to have evaporated. Another shows a figure hovering in space, the body indistinct and transluscent, the head a blur of light. Whether this being is human or extraterrestrial is hard to say (Cotter).    JUSTINE KURLAND, ''Songs of Experience,'' Gorney, Bravin and Lee, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 352-8372, through Oct. 9. Ms. Kurland's exhibition intersperses photographs from two new and distinctly different series: black-and-white pictures taken at Renaissance fairs, which mostly portray people dressed as knights in armor; and large color pictures of blackened trees taken in an Oregon forest after a fire. The combination evokes legends like the Holy Grail, the world in a state of ruin that must be revived by a hero completing some mystical mission (Johnson).    AN-MY LE, Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372, through Oct. 23. ''Theater of war'' refers to the geo-political area that any war actively encompasses. But battles are staged and choreographed, troops deployed in units, like corps de ballet. All of this requires rehearsal, and rehearsal for war is the subject of these photographs, shot at the Marine Corps Air Ground Control Center in California, a desert outpost where marines train for future combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. The terrain has a John Ford-ish grandeur. The marines act out cowboy-and-Indian roles: some play Americans; others play Iraqis. The pictures are dramatic and gorgeous, as combat photography often is. They are also apt documents of a war which, some people argue, is based on a fiction and, at least as originally scripted, staged for the media (Cotter).    * NALINI MALANI, Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 989-7074, through Oct. 23. Ms. Malani, based in Mumbai, has been seen here only sporadically, with paintings in museum group shows and an intensely theatrical video installation at the New Museum two years ago. Both media play a role in this strong gallery solo show, her first in Manhattan, that draws on mythology, religion and history, both Western and Indian, particularly as they shape the lives of women. In paintings, she dovetails the figures of Sita from the ''Ramayana'' and Medea -- the one an ideal of submissive self-sacrifice, the other an emblem of destructive fury -- to propose a complex female persona beyond controlling stereotypes. A video installation addressing sectarian violence and a magic lantern-style shadow play complete the exhibition, which finds a political artist of impressive visual range at the height of her power (Cotter).    IRAN DO ESPÍRITO SANTO, ''Replacement,'' Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through Oct. 16. This Brazilian sculptor produces a sleek blend of Minimalism, Pop and Surrealism. The exhibition includes a series of six solid stainless steel light bulbs in porcelain sockets; parts of a concrete block wall carefully carved from sandstone; a set of large, white aluminum panels that comments on the gallery as a white cube; and, best of all, an unusually tall, industrial-size can -- like a can for tomato sauce -- made of polished solid stainless steel (Johnson).    DEAN SMITH, Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-3363, through Oct. 9. Mr. Smith, who lives in California, makes formally and materially engaging drawings that involve labor-intensive processes of graphite application. Some consist of zillions of tiny marks radiating from central points, and suggest furry textures or magnetic fields; others describe complex configurations of boxes in space, with straight lines incised into satiny graphite surfaces, and hint at a Platonic metaphysical dimension (Johnson).    MIKE PETER SMITH, ''John in the Desert,'' Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, through Oct. 9. A failed geologist is the antihero of this small sculptural saga; an explorer of desert land who seeks to leave his imprint on it. With clever simulations of varicolored desert sandstone, shaped from plastic and paint in the form of rounded stalactites, Mr. Smith builds toy-size wallpieces: ''John'' groping in the conic depths of a rock formation; a mesa with a campfire site and the skeleton of a prehistoric creature caught in rootlike rocks below; a wrecked truck on the side of a rugged slope; a howling dog chained to a desiccated tree on a bulbous boulder. The chef d'oeuvre of this appealing show is ''Canyon,'' a deep cone lined with red rocks you can peer into, whose outer surface is prettily colored in blue with yellow stripes, like a fancy ice cream cone (Glueck).    Other Galleries    * FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION NATIONAL MONUMENT, Foley Square, Lower Manhattan, (212) 206-6674, through Nov. 13. On a return engagement sponsored by Creative Time and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, this interactive outdoor sculpture, made in the symbolic year 1984, consists of a big, bright red Constructivist-style megaphone, through which members of the public can exercise their right to free speech. The work is a collaboration among the architect Laurie Hawkinson, the artist Erika Rothenberg and the performer John Malpede. It points, perhaps appropriately, toward the state and federal courthouses (Smith).    ROY LICHTENSTEIN, City Hall, City Hall Park and the Tweed Courthouse, Lower Manhattan, through Oct. 15. Rising five stories under the octagonal skylight of the Tweed Courthouse's fabulous Italianate rotunda, Lichtenstein's clunky tower of giant cartoon brush strokes is an impressive sight, the centerpiece of a Public Art Fund installation of four sculptures in and around City Hall. Its sly commentary on Modernist myths of freedom and spontaneity is enhanced by its insertion at the core of New York City's bureaucratic control center. You can't just spontaneously walk in to see it, though. You can call 311 to sign up for a Friday-only tour (Johnson).    TERESA HUBBARD AND ALEXANDER BIRCHLER, ''Single Wide,'' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, through Oct. 22. ''Single Wide'' is a technically sophisticated, six-minute video loop that revolves around the nighttime event of a distraught woman crashing her pickup truck into her rural ''single wide''-size trailer home. Shot in one long circulating pan, it is like a film version of a Gregory Crewdson photograph with the vividly amplified sound effects of a Janet Cardiff production (Johnson)    Last Chance    * ELISE ASHER, June Kelly, 591 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 226-1660, through Tuesday. Asher, who died in her 90's this year, was a painter who wrote poetry, and a poet who painted. Many of her pictures were inspired by other poets, among them her husband, Stanley Kunitz. The visual motifs that run through the 10 paintings in this memorial show -- from clocks and tombstones to angelic birdlike creatures to landscapes with the low-horizoned, storm-approaching character of oceanside terrain -- have the weight of personal metaphors (Cotter).    ''CLARA PARK,'' Marianne Boesky, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9889, through tomorrow. This presentation of work by eight recent graduates of the Leipzig Academy, a former bastion of East German social realism, has the look and feel of a high-caliber student show. Matthias Weischer's large, drably colored paintings of retro-modern rooms appear haunted by ghosts of the Communist past. David Schnell's weirdly artificial, autumnal forest-scapes and Martin Kobe's glowing, futuristic vision of architectural infrastructure look like cover illustrations from old science fiction paperbacks (Johnson).    ''THE GAMES IN ANCIENT ATHENS: A SPECIAL PRESENTATION TO CELEBRATE THE 2004 OLYMPICS,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Sunday. Established 200 years after the original festival that began at Olympia in 776 B.C., the Panathenaic Games in Athens followed much the same lines, except that they awarded far more valuable prizes than the simple wreaths that crowned Olympic champions. Chief among them were large painted amphorae (vases) filled with valuable olive oil from a sacred grove. The Met has placed nine of these treasures on display in special showcases in its first-floor Greek galleries, along with other works, and set up a kind of treasure hunt for visitors throughout the rest of the galleries by placing special markers next to other games-related art. Hours and admission: see above (Grace Glueck).    ''ISAMU NOGUCHI: SCULPTURAL DESIGN,'' Noguchi Museum, 32-37 Vernon Boulevard, at 33rd Road, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, through Monday. This beautiful small museum dedicated to Noguchi's elegant Modernist sculpture and design has reopened after renovations. A new program of temporary exhibitions begins as well, with about 100 of Noguchi's sculptures, stage props, furniture, paper lights and models collected into a sprawling, cluttered and noisy show organized by the theater designer Robert Wilson. Works from the permanent collection are in the clean, cool and quiet ground-floor galleries and the garden. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 62+, $2.50 (Johnson).

In \\"Search and Destroy,\\" Howard Korder's new play at the Yale Repertory Theater, Martin (Joe Urla) does what any self-respecting man would do in such a predicament. He flees the law, his estranged wife, his Boca Raton condo and eventually even hisname to journey across the country in search of a career in the movie business.   Martin is an American everyman with a dream, some might say, but that's not quite the way that Mr. Korder sees it. The hint of violence in the title of this pitch-black comedy is no joke. As Martin travels through the landscape in search of self-fulfillment, fast cash and show-biz glory, \\"Search and Destroy\\" unfurls a progressively more violent panorama of American life in which drugs, sadism, white-collar theft and murder finally converge in an almost pornographic shootout in a polluted swamp in industrial New Jersey.

The piece, known formally as the Piano Concerto in D (Op. 61a), was resuscitated by Gerard Schwarz and the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestrar on Thursday and played with grace and simplicity by Vladimir Feltsman. Beethoven's little money-making venture -- part of a package deal with his English publishers that included the violin original, three quartets, a symphony, a bona fide piano concerto and an overture -- came across as a strange creature indeed.    With no apparent pangs of conscience, Beethoven chose to overlook the unworkability of the premise. He did, however, follow the thought to its odd conclusion with reasonable care and thoughtfulness. The problems in this transcription lie not necessarily in the transfer of the violin's legato properties to the keyboard -- these survive with a minimal loss of communication -- but in the geology of the original, whose D Major terrain is calculated to the needs of the violin but not necessarily to those of the piano.

That's enough for most people. Without reading any further, they will rush off to get tickets—or drop the paper and say for the thousandth time, \\"I don't see why everybody goes so crazy about that vulgar little clown. He bores me to death.\\" But those who stay at home never will be missed by those who go. Nor would they be noticed if they went along, too. They are an unimpressive minority.But, still, they are not insignificant. There are some intelligent people among them, and it means something that even a few minds perceive only coarse horseplay in a Chaplin comedy. And it does not mean that such people are blind. The truth about many of them is that they have a taste for refined things and are antagonized by the undeniable crudities in the Chaplin comedies. Naturally, then, they are in no mood to discern and appreciate the really fine things about Chaplin's acting. If you are disgusted by the comedy of a well-placed kick in the seat of the pants in one scene, you are not likely to be on the alert to catch the finely shaded suggestion of the comedian's pantomime in the next. So your impression is one of horseplay and you wonder why some otherwise intelligent friend says that Chaplin is a great artist.Now, refined taste is a good thing. The world needs more of it, and you are not to be scorned because of your sensitiveness. But you are missing something nevertheless. For Chaplin is a great artist, and you may satisfy yourself of this fact if you will go to this latest picture of his, \\"The Idle Class,\\" and watch his pantomime. It is not his best picture. It is not as penetratingly human as \\"The Kid\\" and \\"Shoulder Arms,\\" but Chaplin does finished work in it, and it is more free from slapstick than some of his earlier productions. The rough-and-tumble stuff has not been eliminated, but it's been largely reduced, and in a number of scenes Chaplin says more by a look or a gesture than other players can express in eight uninterrupted reels. Just watch for that, \\"O well, I'm a poor bum and she's a swell lady\\" expression when the girl on horseback rides away from him. There's philosophy in a flash.Like most of the Chaplin comedies \\"The Idle Class\\" doesn't concern itself much with a story. Its main purpose is to give Chaplin a chance to contrast two characters—a wealthy fop and a foppish tramp. He makes both comic, of course, but each in a different way. It's hard to see how you can help enjoying both, even if they are exaggerated and the story they are in doesn't mean anything.The Chaplin film is short, only two reels, so the Strand program is filled with a variety of numbers, variously Interesting. After the Topical Review the first picture is another of \\"The Adventures of Bill and Bob\\" series, \\"The American Badger,\\" in which the two boys of the preceding chapters make camp and capture a badger. It is one of the most interesting and least brutal of the set. Then comes a two-reel dramatic piece called \\"The Ne'er to Return Road,\\" written by Mrs. Otis Skinner, which is a too heavily sentimental and melodramatic story of forgiveness and gratitude, but is well photographed and moderately tense in some of its scenes.Then there is one of the refreshing Sport Pictorials by Grantland Rice and Jack Eaton, and Winsor McCay, whose \\"Gertie\\" was one of the first, if not the original, of all animated cartoons, contributes \\"The Dream of a Rarebit Fiend,\\" which, though not as brightly humorous as it might be, is interesting because of its excellent workmanship and fantastic character.The principal numbers of the accompanying musical program are a baritone solo, Margetson's \\"Tommy Lad,\\" by Richard Hale","excerpt":"a violin solo: Sarasate's \\"Caprice Basque,\\" by Marta de la Torre, and a soprano solo from Friml's \\"Sometime,\\" by Estelle Carey. The overture is Tchaikovsky's \\"Capriocio Italien.\\"There's an exceptional picture at the Rivoli this week. It's called \\"The Beggar Maid,\\" and is, in a way, based on Tennyson's poem and Burne-Jones's painting of the same name. It is the result, according to report, of an idea originating with Miss Vera Reyer and executed for the Triart Picture Company by Lajaren á Hiller, as art director, and Herbert Blaché, as dramatic director. A committee of artists and art patrons, including Robert W. De Forest, Francis C. Jones, Edwin H. Blashfield, Charles Dana Gibson, Robert Aiken, Louis C. Tiffany and Daniel Chester French, is said to have endorsed the idea and selected \\"The Beggar Maid\\" and other paintings for its application, without, however, assuming any personal direction of, or responsibility for, the carrying out of the plan.The idea seems to be the dramatization of certain masterpieces of painting. In \\"The Beggar Maid,\\" for instance, a story is told of Burne-Jones's creating his picture as the result of his interest in the love of a young English earl and a peasant girl on his estate. The painter plays the role of matchmaker, and, by vivifying the love of Tennyson's King Cophetua for his \\"beggar maid,\\" subdues the fears of all concerned that love between persons in widely separated social classes may result unhappily.All this may sound like a conspiracy on the part of the good people responsible for the picture. Are they simply using the movies to popularize great works of art? Did they start out with Burne-Jones because he has been made somewhat familiar to the groundlings already by Kipling's \\"rag and a bone and a hank of hair\\"? The people who go to motion-picture theatres don't often go to art museums, and Rembrandt and Michelangelo and Rubens are either terrible or tiresome names to them. But if these painters and others can be dramatized, if their works can be associated in the popular mind with sentimental and domantic legends, then art has been brought to the people, modified somewhat, of course, and not in a way that is likely to impress the exclusive artist, but still in a manner and for a purpose which the democratic will not despise. So the feeling that you are the object of a conspiracy may come over you as you watch \\"The Beggar Maid\\" on the screen, and you won't like the feeling, because no one likes to be the object of a conspiracy, even of a beneficent conspiracy.But unless you watch out, you will lose the feeling. For \\"The Beggar Maid\\" is beautifully done. Its pictures are so charming, and its story, though sentimental, is so simply genuine that you are likely to find yourself enjoying the piece and forgetting all about the conspiracy before you know it. If you like motion pictures for themselves you can't help relishing the photography and composition of the scenes of \\"The Beggar Maid.\\" It is pictorially climatic—that is, it reaches its successive crises in pictures that are works of cinematographic art in themselves. And a lovely girl, a newcomer to the screen, Miss Mary Astor, gives the beggar girl all of the grace and charm she is supposed to have.So the makers of \\"The Beggar Maid\\" have done their work well. No matter what ulterior motive they may or may not have, they have made a valuable contribution to the screen. Let them go on and do more.Also at the Rivoli is a William S. Hart picture, \\"Three-Word Brand,\\" and one of Max Fleischer's most diverting \\"Out of the Inkwell\\" cartoons.\\"The Invisible Power,\\" directed by Frank Lloyd, is at the Capitol, where Ben Turpin is appearing in person, and the Rialto is featuring two pictures, George Melford's \\"The Great Impersonation\\" and a Charles Urban-Raymond Ditmars work called \\"The Four Seasons.\\"\\"Knock-Na-Gow,\\" an Irish photoplay, begran a two weeks engagement at the Lexington Theatre yesterday. THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1992","title":"Nigel Kennedy participated in two separate events at Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday night. The first was simply to walk on stage, an act that the young British violinist made into a cultural experience all its own. With his coonskin-cap haircut, patched jacket, flowing scarf, running shoes and amazing parti-colored socks, Mr. Kennedy moved among the tail-coated members of the New York Philharmonic like a myna bird among penguins. He leered briefly at his audience as the orchestra tuned, a particularly outrageous party crasher who has gotten past the butler and made himself at home.   Mr. Kennedy's other activity was to play the Sibelius Violin Concerto on the first half of a Philharmonic subscription concert. This was another act of iconoclasm but, I think, a very different one. His clothes, the stage speeches and stiff little imitations of jazz-musician handshakes had been an exercise in anomaly, an \\"I don't belong here and don't care\\" demeanor made piquant by a musical ability superior, or at least equal, to that of anyone on stage who did \\"belong.\\" Review/Music","excerpt":"A Violin Virtuoso From Britain Who's an Original Down to His Socks"},{"year":"1990","title":"In both programming and performance, the formal New York debut of Victor Schultz, a Canadian violinist, on Friday evening at Weill Recital Hall was easier to admire on some abstract level than to love. The program ranged adventurously and showed a strong interest in 20th-century music, with works or movements by Edvard Grieg, Eugene Ysaye, Ernest Bloch, George Antheil, Ilhan Mimaroglu, Josef Suk and John Corigliano and an encore by Bedrich Smetana. But no particular logic emerged from this string as a whole or from any individual juxtapositions.   What unfortunately did unify the program to some extent was the violinist's unvarying approach: earnest and blunt, with burly, insistent tone. Mr. Schultz, who took second prize in the 1989 Carnegie Hall International American Music Competition for Violinists, commands a formidable technical arsenal with great efficiency but little flair or character. He overcame serious intonational problems in Grieg's Violin Sonata No. 2, which probably resulted from nervousness, but his personality never blossomed.   A work like Ysaye's Solo Sonata No. 2 requires not only virtuosity but also indomitable temperament to put across. Grieg, Suk and Smetana require not only dynamic nuance but also a certain sweetness of tone. Mr. Schultz's sonority was almost painfully intense at times in this acoustically bright hall, especially in the Lento of Mr. Corigliano's Violin Sonata.   Good intentions were everywhere evident and typically inadequate. Christine Diwyk, an American pianist, accompanied assertively and with a warmth and flexibility that only emphasized what was lacking in Mr. Schultz's playing. Ms. Diwyk's enlivening touch was missed in the solo Ysaye and the tape-accompanied Mimaroglu.

The band, which mixes aboriginal music from Australia with various international pop styles, performs in aboriginal outfits. The band members come out, bodies painted, playing sticks and didgeridoos. They perform a short set of tribal music, unaccompanied. And they do traditional dances. Inadvertently, their shows become a type of ethnic spectacle.   Their music deserves more of a response. The band, from northeastern Australia, has recently released a new album, \\"Freedom\\" (Hollywood), and can get a real rock momentum going. Its blend, where a didgeridoo, gutturally repeating a few notes, anchors the bottom end of the music and the clanging of hard wooden sticks sifts in and out of bass, guitar and keyboards, offers a beautiful musical vision of cultures in flux.

It is a splendid unit already, with the sheen and power of an international ensemble but husbanding the dark glow special to Russian orchestras of the past and largely lost to a worldwide one-size-fits-all performance style.

This mental dream-theater is not a pleasant place to be, but for half of the film it is an artistically arresting one. Otto Weininger was a homosexual Jewish philosopher who hated women, Jews and his own homosexuality. In Vienna in 1903, shortly after converting to Christianity, he killed himself at the age of 23 in the room where Beethoven died. On screen, the pressures of his life converge into a swirl of memory and imagination in a fluid performance-art manner that finally collapses under the weight of its own symbolism.    Weininger is played by Paulus Manker, who also wrote and directed the work, which opened yesterday at Film Forum. It is his version of the play \\"Weininger's Last Night: The Soul of a Jew,\\" by Joshua Sobol (the author of \\"Ghetto,\\" the controversial musical about the Holocaust).

It is an interesting experiment but one wherein the story even allowing for the peculiar license necessary for such offerings, lays itself open to chuckles rather than sympathy or concern regarding the events.The initial scenes promise a good deal, for some of the flashes are in Technicolor. The characters, however, seem to seize upon song at inopportune moments, which fact might be all very well on the stage but it is a weakness in a picture, for it causes sudden fluctuations of moods, of the persons involved, that are conducive to merriment. The characters in this tale of the French and the Riffians are so easily hoodwinked by the individual known as the Red Shadow that it becomes ludicrous, and added to this there are lines of dialogue that cannot be listened to with a straight face.The comedy offered by a society reported of the Paris newspaper is really of too low an order to fit in with this type of musical offering, even though it did create laughter.The singing, however, is good, and it would be a great deal better if the theatre reproducing device was tuned down a little, for the vocal tones are invariably far louder than the human voice. This is a shortcoming that can be corrected, and some of the interludes of melody are truly effective. John Boles, who plays the Red Shadow, the masked head of a band of daring Riffians, has a voice that is quite pleasing. Carlotta King as Margot, the French girl who seeks adventure, is rather overwhelming during a number of passages in which she is called upon to sing. There are other agreeable voices and an imposing chorus. It is somewhat disquieting, however, when during a dramatic juncture the Ouled Nail dancing girls and the French officers and the Riffs relieve their feelings in an outburst of song.In one sequence, General Birbeau is supposed to be so engrossed in his conversation that he does not observe that the whole place is overrun with Riffs. One presumes that a shadow in the doorway would have been seen by this white-haired military leader. But there are none so blind as those who must not see and none so deaf as those who must not hear!The Red Shadow is the General's son, who poses as somewhat weakminded when he is unmasked, but so soon as he goes to a wooden trunk and pulls forth (as he does countless times during this yarn) his Red Shadow costume, he becomes an intrepid leader, a man of unflinching courage, a wit who dares to be in love with the bored Margot. One might imagine that Margot would have suspected the Red Shadow and Pierre Birbeau were one and the same person, but she never for an instant reveals that she thinks so. It is with marvelous case that Pierre pulls the wool over the eyes of all his companions and toward the end he is challenged by his father to a sword duel. Of course, rather than fight with his father, he undergoes temporary disgrace at the hands of his band of Riffs.The prismatic effects during the Technicolor stretches are beautiful and Roy Del Ruth, the director, has photographed some of these scenes so that the long shadows enhance the sight of Arab figures riding on the wind-swept sands.Johnny Arthur tries hard to be funny and sometimes succeeds. Louise Fazenda is his mate in the picture and she endeavors to help along the lighter vein. Edward Martindel is none too military in his bearing as the old general.
