Essay","excerpt":"Waco, Reno, Iraqgate"},{"year":"1995","title":"Following are excerpts from the question-and-answer portion of President Clinton's news conference at the White House today, as recorded by Reuters and the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription service: Opening Statement    Looking over the last few days, it is clear that this Congress is on the wrong track. I began the year hoping to make bipartisan progress on balancing the budget, on reducing paperwork, reforming regulations and welfare. And therefore, I was very pleased last week when a bipartisan majority voted to reject the extreme anti-environment provisions adopted in the House committee. That was the right thing to do.   But then the lobbyists for the polluters went to work. They got the leadership of the House of Representatives to call the bill back up, and last night in a remarkable exercise of special interest power, the House voted to gut environmental and public health protections. It was a stealth attack on our environment in the guise of a budget bill.   The bill would effectively end Federal enforcement of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, a bill that my Republican predecessor said was his proudest legislative achievement. It allows poisons in our drinking water, raw sewage on our beaches, oil refineries to pollute, and limits a community's right to know what chemicals are toxic which are released in their neighborhoods. It would be bad for our children, our health and our environment.   This is Washington's special interest politics at its most effective and at its worst. Even before these 17 special interest provisions were added, the bill had already dramatically undercut environmental protection by cutting environmental enforcement in half.   You don't need to damage the environment to balance the budget. Our budget demonstrates that, and the budget the American people get out of this session of Congress ought to demonstrate that.   In the past few days, a battalion of lobbyists has swarmed Capitol Hill, exerting enormous pressure to save these loopholes. I said I would use the power of my office to help people, not polluters. I believe we can protect the environment and grow the economy.   So on this so-called environmental bill, my message to the American people should be very, very clear. Don't worry. We'll make common sense reforms, but the minute this polluter's protection act hits my desk, I will veto it.   One of the most interesting things that has received not too much notice in the last few days is that while Congress has been taking care of the special interests, it's also taking care of itself. It is way behind schedule on virtually every budget bill in the hope, apparently, of enforcing a choice at the end of this fiscal year, between shutting the Government down and adopting extreme budget cuts, which will be bad for our country, bad for our economy, and bad for our future.   Apparently they don't even plan on letting the American people see their planned Medicare cuts until the last possible minute. But one bill, wouldn't you know it, is right on schedule. The bill that funds the Congress, its staff and its operations. I don't think Congress should take care of its own business before it takes care of the people's business.   If the Congressional leadership follows through on its plan to send me its own funding bill before it finishes work on the rest of the budget, I will be compelled to veto it. I want to work with Congress to pass a balanced budget to protect the health and security of the American people. A balanced budget that strengthens our economy and raises the incomes of our people and the future prospects of our children. . . . Q.  Mr. President, your policies and your judgment calls appear to be under siege on Capitol Hill","excerpt":"Waco, Whitewater, Bosnia, social programs, and so forth. How debilitating has this been on you personally, on your administration, on the country? And obviously you're whistling in the dark if you think you're going to have common ground. A.  I disagree. It's not been debilitating, it's been invigorating. And I wouldn't be so surprised. There are two significant things that I would say, big issues that have become clear in the last few days. One is, you can see who's in control in this Congress. Who's in control of the people that compel this unusual revote on the environmental issues.   You see the story on the N.R.A. today. No gun control will be voted out of committee or on the floor of the House. I'm sure glad we got the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban first. And I still think we ought to have a ban on the cop-killer bullets. You see, we're investigating -- this Congress -- is investigating the A.A.R.P. and letting the N.R.A. run one of its own investigations. So you see who's in control. That's the first thing you see.   The second thing you see is more hopeful. There were, after all, 50 Republicans who broke ranks in the House and said that they would put the environment ahead of party. Senator Dole, yesterday, said that in Vermont at the Governor's Conference that he wanted to pass a welfare reform bill free of the extremist provisions which the members of his caucus, some of them, had demanded that he put on a welfare reform bill. And so we may be moving toward finding common ground in welfare reform.   So you see two things: you see who's in control, and it's not good. You see some people feeling uncomfortable about it and we may be able to make some progress. . . . Q.  Speaking of special interest, do you feel that the Speaker is dragging his feet on the bipartisan campaign finance reform commission, and what else are you willing to do to make sure that that happens? A.  Dragging his feet is an apt but inadequate description of what has happened. I mean, we shook hands on that in New Hampshire. I thought it was a fairly simple deal. The man said that the gentleman asked this question. He said, why don't you guys do a base closing commission? We said O.K. Five days later I wrote a letter to the Speaker, I didn't get an answer. Five weeks later, I wrote, I said again, O.K., here are two people that are the counter people that I would put on this commission and I would like for them to get with someone you designate and we'll set it up. . . .  Q.  Mr. President, we know that you have just met with the leadership to try and make your, your veto of the Bosnia arms embargo lifting stick. But in the event that it doesn't and not knowing as we speak what the size of the margin is going to be, what is the next step? What else would you look to do? A.  Whatever the vote is, we still might sustain a veto. But I was encouraged by a few people who told me that they had decided on reflection that it was not the thing to do now. The Rapid Reaction Force, after all, is showing some strength there. And I would remind you that the only thing that has ever worked in the last two and a half years is when the Bosnian Serbs thought the United Nations would permit NATO and the Americans who are working with NATO, to use air power to stop the aggression so that there would have to be a negotiated settlement.   And in the last several days, the last couple weeks in Gorazde, you know we've gotten five convoys through, there has been no assault on it. And I think that this new strategy will work if we can hammer out a negotiated settlement and there is a new effort there. . . . Q.  Can you tell us, first of all, why you want to veto the telecommunications bill? I understand that you're concerned about concentration of media power. And in regard to that, can you comment on the merger yesterday between ABC and Walt Disney and the proposed merger, it may happen today, between CBS and Westinghouse, and whether you see this concentration of power happen? A.  Well, I think first of all, you have to take on these mergers under our law, and as a matter of economics, you have to take them case-by-case and analyze them. And all I know about the proposed mergers is what I read this morning when I woke up. So I can't comment on that.  I do think it would be an error to set up a situation in the United States where one person could own half the television stations in the country or half of any of the media outlets and we don't have a Fairness Doctrine anymore and we don't have----.   Particularly if we took the Federal Government out of, all the Federal agencies out of any kind of maintenance of competition, or maintenance of competitive environment, taking the Justice Department out of it, for example.   I would remind you that we have the most successful telecommunications operations in the world, partly because we have had the proper balance between a highly competitive environment and an openness to new forces and new technologies and new entries in it from all around the world. I want very badly to sign the telecommunications bill. We tried to pass one, this Administration did during the last session of Congress. . . .

Using Tougher Tactics In Peacekeeping Missions  The United Nations, burdened by its inability to stave off the killings in Rwanda in 1994 and by failed missions in Bosnia and Somalia, is allowing its peacekeepers to mount some of the most aggressive operations in its history. The change is most obvious in Congo, which commands the largest deployment of United Nations troops in the world.   A1    Uzbek Riot Claims Contested  Interviews with survivors of the riots in Uzbekistan in which Uzbek authorities killed an undetermined number of civilians indicate that the chaos began as a small armed revolt against President Islam A.

A1    Iraq Cleric Hints at Cooperation  Moktada al-Sadr, a rebel Shiite cleric who led uprisings against the American military, suggested he would forgo military efforts and work to ease rising sectarian tensions throughout Iraq.

A1    Condo Club Scene  Deep-pocketed developers in Miami, forced to be ever more creative in the pursuit of buyers for condos still years from being built, pay for lavish parties, one of the stranger forms of nightlife in a city obsessed with real estate.

A16    Norquist and Abramoff Scrutiny  Jack Abramoff and Grover Norquist helped drive the Republican takeover of the capital and have shared a friendship going back to their days in college.

Mr. Graham and other senators involved in the talks said they planned to meet for one last session in an effort to reach a deal.   A15    Changing Base Closings  The independent commission assessing the Pentagon's proposed list of domestic base closings will spare some installations but could add others that are not on the list, the panel's chairman said. The head of the nine-member Base Realignment and Closure Commission and other panel members say state and local community leaders will now get their turn to rebut the military's recommendations.   A16    Gay Marriage Recognition  Representatives of the nation's top psychiatric group approved a statement urging legal recognition of gay marriage.

A15    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Bloomberg Expands His Philanthropy Locally  Mayor Bloomberg was one of the nation's leading philanthropists well before he ran for mayor of New York in 2001. But since then, the breadth of his philanthropy has expanded to include many more of the city's community, cultural and social service organizations, a development that is emerging as a potentially formidable weapon in his re-election campaign.

Va., is mourning the deaths of two students from the local Catholic high school and the father of one of them in the crash of a sightseeing plane in Coney Island.

It is late to apply any fertilizer to woody plants","excerpt":"wait until early spring. If one compost pile is too large, start a second one. Store leftover seed in glass jars and keep it indoors, not in the tool shed or unheated garage, to prevent freezing. Be sure all seed is clearly labeled.   Peace Lily     Q.    I received a petite peace lily in May and it bloomed for two months. But it has stopped blooming. I am very saddened by the lack of flowers. What have I done wrong? A.E., Brooklyn, N.Y.     A.  Nothing. The peace lily (Spathiphyllum) is not an everblooming plant and two months of bloom is excellent. This is an fine house plant and will thrive in poor light. Do not overwater or over fertilize the plant especially now. Maintain it and then in late spring, the spathiphyllum can be watered more generously and given water-soluble plant food once a month. It should bloom again in spring. African Violets     Q.    I mist. I feed. I keep the soil wet. I've tried everything, but my African violets never bloom. They receive sun every morning. What is wrong? Mrs. R.R.V., Chicago, Ill.     A. Don't \\"try\\" so hard. From the care ritual described, the plants are being pushed. Allow the soil to dry out a bit between waterings. Stop misting. Stop use of fertilizer. Allow the plants to revive on their own. Keep the soil damp, but not wet. It may take several weeks, but the African violets should come back and bloom. Blossom booster fertilizers often stir reluctant plants to bloom, but overuse of fertilizer can also stimulate leafy growth and sacrifice bloom. Bulb Leaves     Q.    When raking up leaves underneath a large Japanese maple, I found many odd-shaped flat, green leaves that were not those of grass or wild garlic. I did not pull them up, however, as I didn't know what they were. Any clues? Dr. G.G., Glassboro, N.J.     A. They were probably leaves of grape hyacinths (Muscari), which send up new growth in fall. The bulbs are often naturalized under shade trees and in borders and multiply rapidly. In fact, many gardeners consider them invasive and are cautious about planting them anywhere. The garden will have scores of blue spikes in spring. If the grape hyacinths do become a nuisance, the bulbs can be dug up immediately after bloom and planted elsewhere where their spread will not be considered invasive. Daffodils     Q.    It happened. We found a bag of unplanted daffodil bulbs in our tool shed. Now what? Is it too late to plant? K.N.M., Philadelphia, Pa.     A. It is late to plant bulbs, but they are certainly better in the ground than left unplanted in a storage bag. Although the air seems cold now, the soil has not chilled down. There still is time for bulbs to develop roots since all roots of woody plants are still actively growing. This root activity will cease, however, when the soil chills down to about 40 degrees. More on Mealybugs/Jade     On Dec. 2 a question was asked about control of mealybugs on jade plants, which have been summered outdoors. When the plants were brought inside again, the writer discovered that one of the jades was infested with the mealybugs. The recommendation was to wipe off the insects every few days with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol. However, my experience with my 20-year-old jade plant has led me to abandon this treatment. I move my jade plant outdoors to the patio for the summer. I noticed ants were on the plant and I have since learned that they eat the mealybugs. When I bring the jade plant indoors for the winter, it is always free of the bugs. Outdoors the ants are attracted to the sand beneath the patio stones and nearby there are peonies and roses to attract the ants. S.G.B., Rhinebeck, N.Y.

Hemlock Scale   This is a good week to use dormant oil sprays. These superior oils are harmless to the environment and control overwintering mites, aphids and psyllids by smothering them, that is cutting off their oxygen supply. The oils are especially helpful in controlling both species of scale insects that have been rampant on Canadian hemlocks in the Northeast.   Hemlocks are troubled by both Fiorinia hemlock scale and hemlock scale. When hemlock needles start to yellow and fall prematurely, suspect scale. Examine backs of needles and look for telltale signs: a flattened white coating on either side of the main rib and flat brown circles. Tops of the needles will show minute yellow spots where the scales' needlelike mouths have been sucking out juices.  Check the superior oil's label directions carefully. Then spray the evergreens according to the recommendations. Choose a quiet windless morning and apply the spray material once. A follow-up application of a systemic insecticide such as Cygon (dimethoate) is recommended in late May.
