R. Gurney's entertaining new play at the Playwrights Horizons Studio Theater, \\"The Old Boy,\\" could also serve as the title of such past Gurney comedies as \\"The Dining Room,\\" \\"The Cocktail Hour\\" and \\"Love Letters.\\" In this prolific writer's accounts of the upper-middle-class precincts of Northeastern WASP-dom, the men are almost always boys who have not grown up and do not really have to. Fortified by privilege and gin, they sail through life via the old-boy network that assures them entry to the right schools, the right clubs, the right firms.     Like Philip Barry and John Cheever before him, Mr. Gurney knows that his old boys pay a price for their eternal juvenility. A typical Gurney protagonist reaches middle age to discover that he has alienated his children, married the wrong woman and followed a pointless career. Sam (Stephen Collins), the sometime Congressman and ambassador at the center of \\"The Old Boy,\\" is no exception. When this distinguished alumnus returns to his old prep school to give a fund-raising speech, he finds himself feeling \\"a little hollow.\\" Sam may be on his way to the governorship of \\"a very important state,\\" but his second marriage is faltering and his political profile amounts to nothing more than the resume of Washington jobs he has accumulated \\"mostly by luck and pull.\\" Review/Theater","excerpt":"A.R.
