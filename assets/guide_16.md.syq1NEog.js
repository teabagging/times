To begin, try the creamy veal tonnato, grilled calamari and couscous salad with lemon vinaigrette, grilled quail with portobellos and lentils seasoned with a cassis vinaigrette, and prosciutto di Parma with sweet melon.   Pastas include squid-ink farfalle tossed with salmon and asparagus and rigatoni combined with eggplant, dried ricotta, tomato and basil.   Among the main courses, grilled sirloin with rosemary is served sliced over arugula, breaded veal chop is topped with diced tomatoes and ribbons of arugula, and fillet of red snapper with fennel and romaine lettuce is steamed in clam juice.

A perfect introduction to the cuisine is pane carasau, the local bread, crisp sheets brushed with oil and sprinkled with rosemary and salt, as is pane frattau, the same bread slathered with tomato sauce and topped with poached quail eggs and shaved pecorino cheese. Other starters include grilled mushrooms over broccoli rape and grilled calamari seasoned with lemon, olive oil and parsley. A salad topped with fresh slices of Sardinian pecorino or the grilled vegetable plate of charred peppers, mushrooms, squash and eggplant are good, too. Bottarga (also known as poor man's caviar) is served shaved over arugula and cannellini beans. Spaghettini comes with lobster, tomatoes, tarragon and garlic. Rabbit stew is made with artichokes, fennel and carrots.

On a recent evening, seared sea scallops on a glistening roasted beet round were well matched with a tart mizuna salad and dressed with a walnut vinaigrette, and grilled foie gras came with a Sauternes sauce, sprinkled with fleshy little cubes of glazed sweet potato and topped with fried leeks. Entrees were no less alluring, whether the seared monkfish medallions over a smooth puree of potatoes, ringed by parsley sauce and lemon-shellfish emulsion; or the pan-roasted skate in a light coat of crushed Arborio served over a ragout of artichoke slices, roasted tomatoes, enhanced by a balsamic-citrus sauce.

COMAPNY REPORTS","excerpt":"3M Earnings Climbed 7.9% in 2d Quarter"},{"year":"1991","title":"The Monsanto Company, a leading chemical producer, yesterday reported a net loss of $52 million for the second quarter because of extraordinary charges related to cost-cutting measures.   The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, a leading producer of industrial and commercial products and specialty chemicals, said its income also fell, slipping 12.5 percent in the second quarter. But W. R. Grace & Company, another chemical producer, reported a 12.3 percent increase in earnings.  Monsanto     Monsanto said its loss was the result of a $325 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the elimination of 2,500 jobs and the closing of three plants. Without the charge, Monsanto said, its income for the quarter would have been $273 million, the highest in its history. It reported net income of $247 million in the second quarter of last year.    Sales for the quarter rose 4 percent to $2.47 billion, from $2.37 billion a year earlier.    Analysts said Monsanto's results were more impressive than they had expected. \\"They have gone through a large-scale restructuring in the second quarter,\\" said Anantha K. S. Raman, who heads an investment research firm. \\"They're biting the bullet, containing costs, and that will help them during the rest of this year.\\"    The company's agricultural business had a gain of $30 million from the sale of its animal feed ingredients business, and its operating income was helped by higher volumes of its Roundup herbicides. The company's chemical division, which accounts for 44 percent of sales, had an operating loss, including the charge for restructuring. Demand for chemicals declined, which it attributed to a slowdown in industrial production during the recession.    Earnings in the company's Searle division doubled during the quarter, thanks to gains from the company's Cytotec ulcer preventive drug and strong sales of its Calan drug for hypertnsion.   On the New York Stock Exchange, Monsanto's shares were up $2.375, closing at $72.50.  Minnesota Mining     Net income at 3M, which makes industrial and electronic equipment, information and imaging products and consumer products, fell to $299 million, from $342 million in the corresponding 1990 quarter, although sales increased to $3.35 billion, from $3.23 billion.   Allen F. Jacobson, chairman and chief executive, said the results reflected a decline \\"in United States economic activity and slow growth abroad,\\" as well as investments in new products and manufacturing processes.   The company said that it expected \\"product pressures to continue in the second half\\" and that it expected third-quarter income to \\"show a decline at least as large as that of the second quarter.\\"    Michael Reilly, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, said that the company's performance was \\"basically in line with what I had expected,\\" but that the prediction of continued pressure on earnings for the second half \\"is certainly something of a surprise.\\" He added: \\"It seems that the recovery is going slower than expected and that the stronger dollar is working against them now.\\"   On the New York Stock Exchange, 3M stock was down $3.375, closing at $89.625 yesterday. W. R. Grace     W. R. Grace & Company said its earnings rose to $57.6 million, or 66 cents a share in the second quarter, from $51.3 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier, while sales rose 4.9 percent to $1.71 billion, from $1.63 billion.   Grace, based in New York, said operating income at its specialty chemicals business fell 2 percent, to $68.4 million. The company attributed the slide to general weakness in the industry.   The company said its energy business had a 66 percent gain in operating income, to $4.8 million, and its National Medical Care unit had a 25 percent increase in income, to $19.9 million.

Martin Katahn, a psychologist with a Ph.D. from Syracuse University who is the director of the Weight Management Program at Vanderbilt University, makes weight-loss promises that apparently can be kept - at least over the short term.

Instead of having people on a highly restrictive, low-calorie diet until the desired weight is achieved - that is, with an end some unknowable time in the future - Dr. Katahn offers a built-in psychological boost, a diet that limits its restrictive phase: for women, 3 days at 600 calories","excerpt":"4 days at 900 calories; a week at 1,200, then a week of the 600/900 calorie plan.
