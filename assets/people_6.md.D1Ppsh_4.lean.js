Retail standby: Bird (now in Williamsburg!), Opening Ceremony, Academy Records. Music venue: Barrowlands in Glasgow. Favorite concert: Most memorable concert ever attended was Nu Shooz in the parking lot of Beaverton Mall, Ore. in 1980-something. Billy Bragg at Big Day Out last year was moving. The favorite show I ever played was at Coachella with LCD Soundsystem — the second time. Music: Thee Oh Sees from San Francisco. I listen to “Heaven” or “Las Vegas” by the Cocteau Twins and Arthur Russell’s “World of Echo” every time I go running, but mostly because they’re what’s on my iPod Shuffle and I haven’t been bothered to change it. Provisions: Wheat toast and Vegemite. For gifts: If I’ve thought ahead, something I’ve knit or embroidered. If I forget, flowers. Restaurant: Marlow & Sons, Snacky, Taco Santana. Drink: Pimm’s Cup when it’s warm; red wine when it’s not. Party central: Any dinner table surrounded by friends. Momentary style obsessions: Jumpsuits. I’m also tirelessly searching for a 1980s Bianchi Sport SX road bike small enough for me to ride. (I need a 42 or 43, in case anyone has any leads.) Reading material: ”The Omnivore’s Dilemma” — although it’s making it very difficult for me to eat carefree. Art pick: The American landscape painters at the Met. Museums: Dia Beacon, Museum of Musical Instruments in Berlin. Movie: “The Blues Brothers.” I think I’ve seen it 25 times. I could watch it another 25.

In this evening of unrelenting self-worship, Dame Edna Everage, the Australian housewife turned superstar, anoints herself the new queen of Broadway, and not without reason.

Patients were discharged, beds were shut down, but no provision was made for the medical, social and housing needs of this extremely vulnerable group. This is tragic in view of what's known about the capacity for recovery when people with psychiatric illness have the right supports and opportunities.   Public officials were warned in the 1970's of impending disaster, yet next to nothing was done. A community residence program, begun in the early 1980's, has produced only 7,500 spaces to offset a loss of 78,000 psychiatric hospital beds. A new \\"supportive\\" housing program is already a victim of budget constraints.   With more than 185,000 mentally ill adults in New York, the number who are homeless is small compared with the vast numbers who, without medical and social supports, are living marginally and headed for homelessness. Tens of thousands of families are struggling without help to house and care for members whose serious illnesses are impossible to handle alone. Parents in their 70's and 80's agonize in the knowledge that when they die, their adult children will become homeless, joining untreated younger sufferers who are driven by excruciating symptoms to seek relief in the streets. More budget cuts this year are too frightening to contemplate.

It is a good idea to telephone ahead just to make sure everything is on schedule.     Julie Wilson has made a remarkable return this year after a semiretirement of eight years to raise her children. A veteran of more than 35 years of nightclubs and musical shows, Miss Wilson began the year with an engagement singing Cole Porter songs at Michael's Pub that met with such acclaim that she stayed for two and a half months. She is now back at Michael's, this time with the songs of Stephen Sondheim, which reveal a much broader and deeper range of talent than the sophisticated wit and melodic charm of Porter's songs afforded. The basis for Miss Wilson's brilliant, varied performance is her ability to encompass the dry commentary of ''The Ladies Who Lunch,'' the emotional fire of ''Could I Leave You?'' and the Porterlike and rarely heard ''What Do We Do? We Fly,'' sung as a duet with her pianist, David Lewis. Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street (758-2272)","excerpt":"tonight and tomorrow at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. $10 minimum, no cover charge.

Its tale, an adaptation of a novel by Allen Raymond, wanders from the artificial scintillating lights of Paris to the sunlight and shadows of a little Normandy village, thus giving Alma Rubens, who impersonates La Belle Hélène, an opportunity to be seen in radiant costumes and flashing gems in some chapters and, in others, attired as a charming farm girl whose dainty feet are protected by ungainly wooden sabots.Little does Monte Carroll, a gallant young American, suspect that the supposed peasant girl attempting to persuade an obstinate goose to join the other feathered creatures is the right bower of Count Boris Zanko, a gentleman who hides his nefarious activities under the cloak of wealth and a fondness for music. At the time Monte meets Helene she was, one might say, on her vacation, being quite fed up with stealing things wanted by the Count. Soft breezes and fragrant perfumes are often a help in romances, and in this particular case they did their duty, for it is not long after witnessing the encounter between the dark-eyed Helene and the immaculate Monte that many of the spectators must almost feel that they are de trop.It is only a day or so later that Helene decides that she must tell the Count of her decision to abandon he: spy work and the Count, on hearing this, requests one last service from her. It is to steal some papers that are in the possession of an artist, and Helene evidently resolves to throw her heart and soul into this adventure.Robert Agnew portrays Redfern, the artist, who is most careful to have his black velvet tam-o-shanter at the proper angle before he puts brush to palette. When La Belle Hélène invades Redfern's sanctum of peace and quiet, it is with little show of reluctance that the artist deserts his must for romance. He opens a couple of bottles of wine, which he proudly says came all the way from America and therefore must be good: and soon he is a staggering weakling before the nervy beauty. Helene is almost scientific in the means she adopts to ascertain the hiding place of the papers, out subsequently she has reason to regret the success of her final espionage mission.Nobody can blame Monte for being brutal in his denunciation of Helens, but probably everybody will disapprove of Helene when she, after looking up at a picture of Salome performing the dance of the Seven Veils, decides to implore the Count to make an example of Monte in the torture chamber of his grotesque castle on the hill.Monte eventually is asked by the Count to engage in a sword duel, and La Belle Hélène, whose courage has wilted and whose Salome heart has become normal, pleads with the Count by saying:\\"But Boris, you know that you are the best swordsman in France.\\"Miss Rubens is attractive and for the most part quite competent as Helene. Holmes Herbert is capital in the rôle of the Count. Walter Pidgeon, like Miss Rubens, is occasionally oft key, but in a story of this type it never causes much anxiety.In a Movietone feature, which follows the regular news reel of the hop-off of the Columbia, Clarence Chamberlin, the audacious air pilot, is heard and seen in a short talk in which he gives high praise to the gallant Lindbergh and declares that when the audience hears him from the screen he hopes to be well on his way across the Atlantic.S. L. Rothafel's surrounding program is dignified, artistic and diverting.

SONOMA JAZZ+ FESTIVAL May 26-29. A gimmick never hurts when promoting a music festival, and this new Memorial Day weekend series in Sonoma has a great, if obvious, one: jazz and wine. Founded by the producers of Jazz Aspen Snowmass in Colorado, its bookings are delicious in moderation: Tony Bennett, Diana Krall, Boz Scaggs with Steve Winwood, Regina Carter, Lizz Wright. The organizers promise that tie-ins with the wine industry will be ''at the highest possible level,'' which means concerts with names like ''Piano and Pinot'' and ''Cabaret and Cabernet.'' I cringe but reach for the syrah. (866)527-8499 or www.sonomajazz.org.    WORLD FESTIVAL OF SACRED MUSIC Los Angeles, Sept. 17-Oct. 2. Coming at the tail end of the season is one of the planet's biggest and most intriguing world-music festivals. Founded in 1999 as a triennial, it faced a logistical nightmare in 2002, when visa problems and other post-9/11 complications wreaked last-minute havoc with its lineup. But it has returned strong, with 45 events over 16 days. Highlights include the Czech folk group Hardistan; the Hun Lakorn Lek Puppet Theater of Thailand; the Palestinian-born oud master Simon Shaheen; the Indian group Sidi Goma, which plays an ecstatic Sufi music derived from East Africa; the Tuvan throat singers Chirgilchin; and Amadou Kienou, from Burkina Faso.

The Labor Day Festival (Sept. 1-5), in nearby Snowmass Village Town Park, will have Widespread Panic, Steve Winwood, Willie Nelson and the reunited Loggins and Messina.

Concerts include the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, Michael Feinstein, the children's-folk queen Ella Jenkins and Ojos de Brujo, flamenco-hip-hop fusionists from Spain.

One of the largest blues happenings in the world, this series of free concerts in Grant Park, programmed by the mayor's office, regularly draws gigantic crowds -- average daily attendance is usually more than 150,000. Take a look at the lineup and you'll see why. This year, the 22nd, features Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Lucky Peterson, Koko Taylor, Hubert Sumlin, John Mayall, Kim Simmonds, Robert Lockwood Jr. and, celebrating his 90th birthday, David (Honeyboy) Edwards.

Lollapalooza, the tour that all but codified the idea of alternative rock in the 90's, seemed to have faced a sad end last year when it was revived as a movable feast of nostalgia served over two-day minifestivals in 16 cities but then abruptly canceled. This year the franchise has been reimagined as a two-day event in Grant Park -- no tour at all -- with Weezer, Death Cab for Cutie, the Pixies, the Arcade Fire, Dinosaur Jr., the Kaiser Chiefs, the Killers, Dashboard Confessional, Billy Idol (yes, Billy Idol), the Bravery, Liz Phair, Louis XIV, M83, the Walkmen and others. www.lollapalooza.com.

Summer in New York means music outdoors and (mostly) free, and the Celebrate Brooklyn series, now in its 27th year, is an ideal urban concert space: a handsome band shell with a small paved area for chairs, surrounded by cool grass on a gentle slope. Highlights include Rickie Lee Jones on opening night; the Bad Plus, Charlie Hunter and James Carter on June 17; the New Pornographers, Stars and the Sadies on June 25; a family concert with the brilliant pranksters Polygraph Lounge on July 9; Ozomatli on July 14; Charlie Musselwhite and Bettye Lavette on July 15; Eddie Palmieri on July 23; and the annual African concert with Papa Wemba, Gokh-Bi System and Maria de Barros on July 31.

The classiest class act in jazz has a full lineup at Carnegie Hall, the Beacon Theater and elsewhere, as usual. It's even a little bit classier this year with the addition of concerts at Rose Theater, the new home of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Highlights among the highlights: a 90th-birthday tribute to Les Paul, tributes to Rosemary Clooney and Jaco Pastorius, Chick Corea, Cesaria Evora with Keren Ann, Keith Jarrett, Wayne Shorter, Dave Brubeck, Michel Camilo, Geri Allen, Harry Connick Jr., a Marsalis Music night at Zankel Hall and free concerts at the South Street Seaport, Prospect Park and the World Financial Center Plaza. My only beef is the disappearance of the free lunchtime concerts at Bryant Park; I was starting to really like them. (212)501-1390 or www.festivalproductions.net.    LINCOLN CENTER Summer presentations include the Midsummer Night Swing series in June and July, with low-dipping, high-kicking dance music by the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, Duke Robillard, Rosie Flores and Wanda Jackson, the Village People (really) and a tribute to Illinois Jacquet, who died last July days after he closed the festival for the 16th time; the Lincoln Center Festival in July, featuring a double bill of Wyclef Jean with the Senegalese rap group Daara J, and the world premiere of ''My Life as a Fairy Tale,'' a music-theater work directed by Chen Shi-Zheng with music by Stephin Merritt of Magnetic Fields; and the annual Out of Doors series in August and September with free concerts all over the Lincoln Center grounds, featuring Dee Dee Bridgewater, Doc Watson, Ricky Skaggs, Marcia Ball and Babatunde Lea. Events hotline (212)875-5766, tickets (212)721-6500 or www.lincolncenter.org.    RIVER TO RIVER FESTIVAL June through September. A group of largely unrelated series, River to River is, literally, more of a marketing program for Lower Manhattan than a unified festival, and untangling its complicated schedule can be harder than reading stock tables. But look closely and you'll see individual series with real personality: the scrappy indie bands at the South Street Seaport, and bigger art-rock names like Castle Clinton; a solid blues series in Battery Park City; really big names in Battery Park. Highlights this year under various rubrics are a Jenny Lind tribute with Audra McDonald, Arlo Guthrie, Yo La Tengo and Stephen Malkmus on July 4, Calexico, McCoy Tyner and Tinariwen. (212)835-2789 or www.rivertorivernyc.com.    SIREN MUSIC FESTIVAL Coney Island, July 16. Five years old now, this essential (and free) day of gloriously noisy rock, presented by The Village Voice, is always a joy; who knew that up-to-the-minute indie bands playing their latest B-sides sounded so good in the bright sunshine at the beach? The acts have not yet been confirmed, but past highlights, including Death Cab for Cutie, TV on the Radio, Guided by Voices, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and the Shins, have been must-sees. www.villagevoice.com/siren.    SUMMERSTAGE Rumsey Playfield, Central Park. Here's one good reason to be thankful you don't have that weekend house in the Hamptons. A nice summer day is made unforgettable by a concert in Central Park, and every summer New Yorkers are blessed with many unforgettable concerts, thanks to SummerStage. I could do without the crowd-control metal fences everywhere -- what is this, Woodstock '99? -- but they are a small price to pay for music like this. The Killers and Louis XIV open the season on June 4 with a benefit (i.e., not free) concert; other benefits include Modest Mouse (June 20), David Byrne (June 29), Dinosaur Jr. and Broken Social Scene (July 14), Lyle Lovett (July 18), Elvis Costello with Emmylou Harris (July 19), and Death Cab for Cutie, the Decemberists and Stars (Aug. 18). Free shows include Cassandra Wilson (June 24) and the Blind Boys of Alabama (July 10), with the full schedule to be announced May 18. (212)360-2777 or www.summerstage.org.    VISION FESTIVAL Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, June 12-19. The very survival of this densely programmed avant-garde jazz series, now in its 10th year, is a tribute to the vitality and loyalty of the downtown scene. Like most downtown institutions, it has bumped from place to place over the years and this summer has a new home. This year is a who's who of an esoteric musical subculture: William Hooker, Roy Campbell, Steve Dalachinsky, Oliver Lake, Wayne Horvitz, Joe McPhee, Matthew Shipp, Joseph Jarman, Mat Maneri, Bill Dixon, Charles Gayle, Jorge Sylvester. (212)696-6681 or www.visionfestival.org    New York State    JONES BEACH Wantagh. Concerts this year include Sting with Joss Stone and Phantom Planet (May 13), Velvet Revolver and Hoobastank (May 14), Stevie Nicks and Don Henley (June 10), the Pixies (June 14), Judas Priest and Queensryche (June 17), Tom Petty and the Black Crowes (June 21), James Taylor (July 1), Chicago and Earth, Wind and Fire (July 3), John Mellencamp and John Fogerty (July 8), Brian Wilson (Aug. 13), Motley Crue (Aug. 16) and the Allman Brothers Band with Moe (Aug. 24). (516)221-1000 or www.tommyhilfigerjonesbeach.com.    MOEDOWN Snow Ridge Ski Area, Turin, Sept. 2-4. Not many bands get to hold their own festivals, with long sets and famous guests and bucolic settings. Moe, a popular second-tier jam band that formed in Buffalo in 1991, has beaten the system with Moedown, its annual festival in the Adirondacks north of Utica, playing for six years now with guests like the Flaming Lips, Ani DiFranco, Blues Traveler and Medeski, Martin and Wood. Check the band's Web site for the schedule, to be announced soon: www.moe.org    ROCHESTER INTERNATIONAL JAZZ FESTIVAL June 10-18. Just four years old, this series has already established itself with programming as solid as anything in San Francisco, New York or Newport: Sonny Rollins, Dave Brubeck, Chick Corea, Chaka Khan, Chris Botti, Madeleine Peyroux, Chiara Civello, John Scofield, Bill Frisell and Ravi Coltrane. (585)234-2002 or www.rochesterjazz.com    North Carolina    AN APPALACHIAN SUMMER FESTIVAL Boone, July 1-30. This multidisciplinary series has everybody from Lily Tomlin to Peter Serkin, Branford Marsalis to Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Offerings are eclectic and high-brow (well, maybe not the fireworks with former members and sound-alikes of the Temptations and the Supremes), as if to prove that ''Appalachian'' does not have to have anything to do with fiddles and folk music. (800)841-2787 or www.appsummer.org.    Rhode Island    JVC JAZZ FESTIVAL Newport, Aug. 11-14. Now 51 years old, the festival kicks off with a screening of the documentary ''Miles Electric: A Different Kind of Blue,'' and concerts feature (take a breath now): Eartha Kitt, Joe Lovano, Richard Bona, Patricia Barber, Roy Haynes, Michael Brecker, Jason Moran, Joshua Redman, T.S. Monk, Charles Lloyd, Wynton Marsalis, Carla Bley, Geri Allen, Bela Fleck, Jon Faddis, Ravi Coltrane, a special Guitar Stage with Kurt Rosenwinkel, Bill Frisell, Russell Malone, Larry Coryell (401)847-3700 or www.festivalproductions.net.    NEWPORT FOLK FESTIVAL Aug. 5-7. The real fun here tends to happen when Bob Dylan appears. This year the lineup includes Arlo Guthrie and Nanci Griffith. Now where did I put my copy of ''Bob Dylan Live 1966''? (401)847-3700 or www.newportfolk.com.    Tennessee    BONNAROO Manchester, June 10-12. This undefinable smorgasbord on a 700-acre farm south of Nashville, now in its fourth year, is one of the few musical events in the country that rightly deserves to be called a festival. The Mars Volta and Widespread Panic play alongside Modest Mouse, the Dave Matthews Band, Jurassic 5, John Prine, Herbie Hancock, Rilo Kiley, Kings of Leon and Particle. Sounds festive! The organizers follow an aesthetic of abundance and connoisseurship, and attendees report genuine musical serendipity: My Morning Jacket fans check out Earl Scruggs, Mouse on Mars hipsters get a taste of the Allman Brothers. Plus: Joanna Newsom, RJD2, Saul Williams, Bob Weir and Ratdog, Herbie Hancock's Headhunters 2005, Drive-By Truckers, Brazilian Girls, the Perceptionists, Black Crowes, Gov't Mule. Bring sunscreen, a change of clothes and taping equipment. www.bonnaroo.com    CMA MUSIC FESTIVAL Nashville, June 9-12. Country music does not have many big summer festivals around the country the way jazz or classical music do. But the CMA Music Festival pretty much makes up for any deficit. It has one of the biggest rosters of any musical event in the country, with so many names included that trying to figure out who's not going to be there could be a good game to play on the road to it. Over four days on stages throughout downtown Nashville come and see: Travis Tritt, Trisha Yearwood, Keith Urban, Lee Ann Womack, Jessi Alexander, Tracy Byrd, Katrina Elam, the Oak Ridge Boys, Tanya Tucker, Trace Adkins, Rascal Flatts, Gretchen Wilson, Jo Dee Messina, LeAnn Rimes, Big and Rich, Darryl Worley (800)262-3378 or www.cmafest.com    Texas    AUSTIN CITY LIMITS MUSIC FESTIVAL Zilker Park, Austin, Sept. 23-25. Attendance has been so extraordinary -- reaching 75,000 a day according to some reports -- at these concerts presented by the people behind the stalwart ''Austin City Limits'' television show that capacity has been reduced by 10,000 ''to increase fan comfort.'' Thankfully the organizers have not stinted on the music. Among the 130 bands planned are the Black Crowes, Lyle Lovett, the Allman Brothers, Oasis, Widespread Panic, the Arcade Fire, Bloc Party and the Doves. (512)389-0315 or www.austincitylimits.com.    Washington    BUMBERSHOOT Seattle, Sept. 2-5. The big outdoor to-do in Seattle each Labor Day weekend is Bumbershoot, which has been going strong for a remarkable 35 years now with a varied lineup of plays, comedians and literary readings. But what really fills the streets for this festival, which takes place in Seattle Center, in the shadow of the Space Needle, are all the pop acts. This year they include Devo, Mavis Staples, the Decemberists, Brazilian Girls, Keren Ann, Ted Leo, Sarah Lee Guthrie and Johnny Irion, and Sonny Landreth. (206)281-8111 or www.bumbershoot.org    Tours    ANGER MANAGEMENT With Eminem and 50 Cent, two of the biggest-selling and most-respected acts in pop. What are they angry about? Begins July 7 in Noblesville, Ind., through Aug. 13, coming to Madison Square Garden on Aug. 8 and 9.    BIG SUMMER CLASSIC String Cheese Incident headlines this crunchy new jam-band tour with Keller Williams, Michael Franti and Spearhead, Yonder Mountain String Band and Umphrey's McGee. It begins July 2 and 3 at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Colo., and runs through the end of July, coming to Keyspan Park in Brooklyn -- the site of one of Phish's sweaty final concerts last summer -- on July 21. www.bigsummerclassic.com.    FRANKIE J AND BABY BASH If you haven't heard these Latin hip-hop stars yet, turn on your radio and you'll surely hear one or both very shortly: Frankie J's ''Obsession'' (''No Es Amor''), featuring Baby Bash, is a Top 10 hit, and Baby Bash's ''Baby I'm Back'' has been in heavy rotation for the better part of the year. Their joint tour was to begin yesterday in Corpus Christi, Tex., and continues through early June. www.latiument.com    GREEN DAY The band is already in the midst of a big victory-lap tour for its newest album, ''American Idiot'' (Reprise), which won a Grammy Award and has been a solid Top 10 hit. Its American and Canadian dates continue through May, then the band goes to Europe for the summer and will return to the United States for more stadium dates in September, including Giants Stadium on Sept. 1. www.greenday.com.    INDIE-ROCK REUNIONS Our parents have had over-the-hill reunion tours by the Who, the Rolling Stones and the Dead. This year we not-quite-kids-anymore have the Gang of Four (starting today at the Coachella festival in Indio, Calif.; through May 21, coming to Irving Plaza in New York May 17 and 18), Dinosaur Jr. (July 7-24, playing at SummerStage in New York on July 14), and the Pixies (a short American tour from May 26 to June 14, when they play at Jones Beach in Wantagh, N.Y.), and I think we win. For one thing, ticket prices are lower.    KRAFTWERK Most reunited pop stars revisit a long-lost past. Kraftwerk, the robotic German techno-pop pioneers of the 1970's, go back to charmingly outmoded visions of the future, with stages that look like the bridge on ''Star Trek'' and actual robots that appear in the musicians' place. A short tour to promote the group's new live album, ''Minimum Maximum'' (Astralwerks, to be released June 7), begins May 30 in Washington and ends June 6 in Los Angeles; the group plays the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York on June 1. www.kraftwerk.com    SARAH McLACHLAN The second leg of her latest tour, which began in 2004 -- she had taken five years since her last big tour -- is under way, and continues through mid-June in the North America; she will play at Madison Square Garden on May 24. www.sarahmclachlan.com.    ALANIS MORISSETTE Her ''Jagged Little Pill'' was the best-selling album of the 90's; for its 10th anniversary she has re-recorded it in acoustic form -- to be released June 13 by Maverick and sold exclusively at Starbucks stores for the first six weeks -- and on her tour will ''play the album from start to finish,'' she recently told Billboard. Beginning June 7 in Toronto, through July 17; coming to Radio City Music Hall on June 15. www.alanis.com.    NINE INCH NAILS To promote his first new album in six years, ''With Teeth'' (Interscope), Trent Reznor and his band are playing smallish theaters and clubs including Stubb's in Austin, Tex., and the Orpheum in Boston. Whether this is being done to create an intimate mood or as a cautious business move will become clear from the charts when the album is released on Tuesday. (Coming to the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York on May 15 and 16.) www.nin.com.    OASIS For some, like me, Oasis is the most annoying British band since Genesis. But for many, many others, the group is member of the great pantheon, and its centrality to the Britpop revolution of the 90's is unquestionable. Amid a full European tour this summer, the band will play a handful of concerts in the United States in June -- including Madison Square Garden on June 22 -- and will return here for a stadium tour in September. www.oasisinet.com.    OZZFEST It used to be said that Cher was the unkillable pop star. Now it looks increasingly like Ozzy Osbourne holds that distinction. A decade ago he was a lovable if inconsequential aging metal icon. Then came the Ozzfest tour, which has outlasted Lollapalooza, Lilith Fair and the Horde tour, and of course ''The Osbournes,'' which, for better or worse, established reality television as a celebrity career-booster vehicle. This year's Ozzfest, the 10th, has Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Rob Zombie, Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall and Mudvayne. It begins July 15 in Boston and runs through early September; it comes to the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., on July 26. www.ozzfest.com.    BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN For his new album, ''Devils & Dust'' (Columbia), which was released last week, Mr. Springsteen is playing solo concerts at relatively small theaters and halls through May 20 (he plays at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on May 19). He'll spend June in Europe, perhaps to return here later this year. www.brucespringsteen.net.    U2 Expect no small-scale we're-not-really-rock-stars concerts from U2; its latest tour is every bit the exuberant, gigantic spectacle that fans (and concert promoters looking for a sure thing) crave. The tour runs through May 28 in the United States (coming to Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on May 17 and 18, and Madison Square Garden on May 21) and through the summer in Europe, returning here in September for lots and lots of concerts (Madison Square Garden Oct. 7, 8, 10, 11 and 14, and Nov. 21-22; the Hartford Civic Center on Dec. 7). www.u2.com    VANS WARPED TOUR Now a stunning 11 years old, the skateboards-tattoos-and-punk traveling circus faces an audience that has grown up with the festival as a part of their young lives. Will they have to add a day-care tent soon? With the Offspring, My Chemical Romance, Dropkick Murphys, Atreyu, Fall Out Boy, the Explosion, Thrice, MxPx, Senses Fail, Strung Out, Tsunami Bomb, Motion City Soundtrack, the Transplants, the Starting Line and lots of others, including Billy Idol on some dates. It begins June 18 in Columbus, Ohio, and continues through mid-August, coming once again to Randalls Island in New York on Aug. 13. www.warpedtour.com.    ZOOMA Phish officially disbanded last year, but we all knew we hadn't seen the last of Trey Anastasio, its bassist. He headlines this new tour with Ben Harper, with 20 to 25 acts rotating as opening acts throughout the summer. Dates have not been announced yet, but the organizers promise at least 28 dates in North America from June 16 to July 31. www.zoomatour.com.   How to Be Cool in the Summer"},{"year":"1996","title":"Tony Bennett's sold-out show at Radio City Music Hall on Friday was odd in that Mr. Bennett, a singer with exceptional abilities, seemed loath to use them. Virtually every song, creeping ballad or up-tempo burner ended with a crescendo  that was at its best an acceptance of the show-business desire to end everything happily, and at its worst the destruction of whatever mood Mr. Bennett had built for the song.         Mr. Bennett's strengths were found in slow or medium-tempo songs, in which he constructed moods of quietude and longing. Almost talking, his voice hissing at  times, buffed at others, he managed to envelop the audience in melancholia, a nostalgia for a lost love that seemed profound, as if it were a metaphor for larger losses. He and his trio -- occasionally backed by a jazz big band or a string-and-brass orchestra -- inched their way through tunes that made the hall  go silent, the calm swing of the band demanding introspection. Then Mr. Bennett  would scream the last three or four words, jolting the audience back into the present, back into a glossy version of happiness.

A1    Georgia Prepares for Bush Visit  A burst of civic polishing is under way in the last hours before President Bush visits Georgia, a nation of four million, where the arrival of an American president is being hailed as a welcome chance both to impress a powerful suitor and to claim a spot on the West's map.

Only a few years ago, audiences and judges at the nation's major showcase for independent films embraced arty, esoteric movies and snubbed those dreaded Hollywood-style products. But the increasing influx of the Hollywood crowd -- coupled with changing styles of film makers -- was evident on Saturday night when audience awards were presented to films that are -- let's face it -- mainstream.   \\"El Mariachi,\\" a comedy-drama by Richard Rodriguez, a 24-year-old Texas film maker, won the Audience Award for a feature film, which is given on a vote by the festival's 5,000 filmgoers and is a good gauge of a film's commercial prospects. The film, about a mariachi musician who enters a Mexican border town at the same time as a hit man, was made by Mr. Rodriguez and his friends for only $7,000. Initially made as a quickie for the Spanish-language video market, it is about as arty as \\"Lethal Weapon.\\" But much funnier.   (Not as funny, and overlooked in the awards, but still the most talked about film, was \\"Boxing Helena,\\" about obsessive love gone haywire. Audiences reacted in two ways: they loved it or they hated it.)   Mr. Rodriguez, an engaging, coolly confident film maker whose movie is to be released by Columbia Pictures in January, said on Saturday night, \\"I just hope this inspires people to make their own movies, no matter who they are, no matter how rich or poor.\\" A Winning Documentary    The Audience Award for a documentary was given to \\"Something Within Me,\\" an affectionate portrait of St. Augustine's School of the Arts in the South Bronx. This unusual elementary school uses music and other forms of artistic expression to nurture a sense of responsibility and pride among its poor, minority students. The movie won two other awards: the Film Makers Trophy and a Special Jury Award for Merit.   The documentary's producer, Jerret Engle, a former editor at the Dutton publishing house, initially heard about the school on the evening news in New York City about five years ago. Since then, she has worked at part-time jobs and spent years raising $250,000 to make the film.   \\"I'm just floored,\\" she said on Saturday night. \\"I love these kids and their teachers, but I didn't know anyone else would be interested.\\" The film, set for a modest commercial release, has already drawn the interest of the Public Broadcasting Service and Home Box Office. Four Grand Prizes    In presenting the awards, the audience was somewhat out of sync with the more traditional Sundance jury. The panel split the Grand Jury prizes among two dramas and two documentaries.   The dramas are \\"Ruby in Paradise,\\" Victor Nunez's rambling film about a young woman who flees her Tennessee town to find her sense of self on the Florida coast, and Bryan J. Singer's \\"Public Access.\\" The latter is about a slick, slightly eerie newcomer to a fictional Midwestern town, Brewster, who takes over the public-access cable network and asks the question: \\"What's wrong with Brewster?\\" The result is nothing less than paranoia.   The jury's documentary awards were given to two powerful works: \\"Children of Fate: Life and Death in a Sicilian Family,\\" a heart-wrenching portrait of three generations of a Sicilian family, and \\"Silverlake Life: The View From Here,\\" a harrowing film about AIDS.   (Other prize-winners included Steve Gomer's \\"Fly By Night,\\" a drama about New York rappers","excerpt":"Tony Chan's \\"Combination Platter,\\" about illegal Chinese immigrants; Everett Lewis's \\"Ambush of Ghosts,\\" about a dysfunctional family; Leslie Harris's \\"Just Another Girl on the IRT,\\" about a black Brooklyn teen-ager, and \\"Lillian,\\" about the struggles of a black woman. A documentary prize also went to \\"Earth and the American Dream,\\" about the destruction of the nation's environment).   \\"Silverlake Life\\" traces the final journey of a film teacher, Tom Joslin, and his companion of 22 years, Mark Maasi, both of whom had AIDS. The two men lived in the Silverlake area of Los Angeles, and both videotaped the film themselves. The graphic film, which includes a hard-to-watch death scene, was completed by a friend, Peter Friedman, a documentary director.   Mr. Friedman, 34, a former student of Mr. Joslin's at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., said he culled 40 hours of videotapes to produce the 99-minute film. \\"It is a direct and a difficult film which shows the realities of day-to-day life with AIDS,\\" Mr. Friedman said after the awards. \\"The whole spirit of the film is to confront the pain and the love shared by these two men.\\" In recent days, he said, television and theatrical distributors have expressed interest in the documentary. A Few Words From the Founder    Sundance is plainly going a bit Hollywood; at least six agents from United Talent Agency, one of the festival's numerous sponsors and more aggressive agencies, were seeking new clients. Still, the awards ceremony hardly resembled the Oscars.   Robert Redford, the founder of the festival, was welcomed onstage with applause and whistles. He wore boots, jeans, a leather jacket and a striped sweat shirt.   Mr. Redford, one of the few millionaire movie stars who have actually paid back the industry by nurturing new film makers, told the packed crowd in a converted basketball gym in this ski resort town: \\"Nobody can understand the blood, the sweat, the dedication it takes to make these films. Nobody can understand that except the film maker.\\"   He said the festival stands for \\"innovation, for the avant-garde.\\" But other film makers and executives say it was virtually unavoidable for Sundance to turn, unwittingly, into a hunting ground for Hollywood. In many ways, Hollywood is less interested in the films shown here -- which often flounder at the box office -- than in new film makers with commercial potential.   \\"It really is a festival of agents,\\" said Jonathan Dana, the president of Triton Pictures, an independent film company, who has been visiting the festival for several years. \\"It's a barter economy. Everyone's trading information. But it's a tricky conversion from the narrow world of independent films to the market place.\\"   Mr. Dana speaks from personal experience. Last year, Triton bought two of the big prize-winners at Sundance: the comedy, \\"In the Soup,\\" whose star, Seymour Cassel, was master of ceremonies at this year's awards, and the documentary \\"A Brief History of Time.\\"   Mr. Dana, standing outside a movie theater in Park City, said simply, \\"One worked; one didn't.\\"   Like another big favorite last year, \\"The Waterdance,\\" \\"In the Soup\\" failed at the box office. But \\"A Brief History\\" succeeded. Mr. Dana shrugged and voiced the oft-heard Hollywood complaint: \\"Who knows what works?\\" 'Orlando' and 'Helena'    Curiously, the two pictures that were most widely discussed at Sundance went unmentioned last night.   One of them, \\"Orlando,\\" an adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel by an English film maker, Sally Potter, had its United States premiere at the festival but was not in competition for prizes. (The festival divides films into two major categories, those in competition and those having premieres.) By virtual consensus, \\"Orlando\\" was the most dazzling film at the festival.   And then there was \\"Boxing Helena.\\"   No film at the festival provoked as much rage, hisses, applause and debate as this one. The film was directed and written by Jennifer Chambers Lynch, the daughter of David Lynch. Even before it was shown here, the movie created an unusual amount of talk because of the last-minute withdrawals of Madonna and then Kim Basinger from the lead role. Helena is now played by Sherilyn Fenn.   The film deals with a lunatic surgeon (Julian Sands) obsessed by an elusive, beautiful woman named Helena. To keep her, he transforms her into his own Venus de Milo by cutting off her arms and legs and placing her on a pedestal. Hard to believe, but the film is a comedy, albeit very dark.   Ms. Lynch, like many of the twentysomething directors here, is a very confident, assured film maker, without a hint of self-doubt.   Sipping coffee and chain-smoking the other morning in a hotel dining room, Ms. Lynch said she was startled by the almost violent reaction to her film. The film has been called anti-feminist, anti-male and exploitative.   \\"People want the film abolished,\\" she said. \\"They scream at us. I wish they would talk to me. I want to hear them. They don't want to have a discussion. They just get up and leave.\\"   Ms. Lynch, who never went to college, grew up in Los Angeles and attended Interlochen Arts Academy in Interlochen, Mich. Upon graduation, she said, she went on a \\"fairly extensive hike with my boyfriend,\\" lived in Baltimore for several months, and then moved to Los Angeles at 19 to work for her father and write the movie. She's now 24. The movie is awaiting a distributor in the United States   \\"My whole intent was to parody and to show seriously what we do to each other in relationships,\\" she said. \\"It's about how we try to change each other. We are equally vulnerable to self-hatred, to obsession, and we try and change each other. It's about how we try to break each other down and control each other -- the thievery that goes on in obsessive relationships.\\"   Although other film makers here find it hard to believe, Ms. Lynch said being her father's daughter was not a blessing.   \\"Believe me, people wanted nothing to do with me,\\" she said. \\"I was 19; it was a risky script; I was some big director's daughter and female. There's something about being a daughter. You would think it gives you some credibility. It doesn't.\\"   At least, Ms. Lynch had no trouble getting through the doors of agents and executives. A Long Island Story    At the other end of the spectrum is Rob Weiss, 26, whose father, Carl, runs a touring business for gamblers in Cedarhurst, L.I. To raise money for his son's film, \\"Amongst Friends,\\" which turned out to be one of the strongest at the festival, Mr. Weiss sent out letters to his customers.   Rob Weiss, who wears his cap backwards and speaks with an unmistakable New York accent, said: \\"My dad's friends are pretty much high rollers. The letter wasn't done in a schlock manner. It was classy. It said, like: 'Hey, if you're going to bet on ball games your entire life, if you're going to bet on horses, do something good with the money for a change. Bet it on the kid.\\"   The bet on the kid seems to be paying off.   The movie is a gritty exploration of a group of wealthy high-school graduates, most of them Jewish or Italian, from the Five Towns of Long Island who drift into boredom, drugs, petty crime and tragedy. The director, who grew up on Long Island and attended the Parsons School of Design for about a year, said this was the world in which he grew up. Mr. Weiss said he owed a great deal to the works of Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Oliver Stone. He said he had seen Phillip Kaufman's \\"Wanderers,\\" about 40 times. (Mr. Kaufman was honored at this year's Sundance Film Festival.)   Mr. Weiss now has an agent, a lawyer, a manager and a publicity agent. Studios are beckoning. But he's not going Hollywood, he insisted. \\"You've got to know where you came from,\\" he said. \\"I live in South-Central L.A., by U.S.C., with my girlfriend. The neighborhood is predominantly African-American and Mexican. It's reality. That's what I want. That's what I need. Nothing's going to change.\\" The Talk of Sundance; The Winners and Notable Losers at Sundance"},{"year":"1997","title":"Profile of Randall Eley, head of Edgar Lomax Co, and his successful Profit Lomax Value fund, which opened in November","excerpt":"Tony Chapellle, editor of Securities Pro, monthly newsltetter that reports on African-Americans on Wall Street, calls Eley an 'outstanding investor'; Eley photo; chart on funds top 10 holdings (M) Applauded, An Investor Steps Onto A New Stage"},{"year":"1984","title":"Signed John Marzano, catcher, to a minor league contract.

But it was just four years ago that ''In the Mood for Love,'' Wong Kar-wai's meditation on loss and desire, introduced him to nonspecialized American audiences. As a figure of ravishing sadness, Mr. Leung's gentle newspaperman, Chow Mo Wan, has no equal. With the smallest gestures -- the tilt of his body, the lift of a hand, a quickly shuttered glance -- he conveys his intense but discreet yearning for the woman who ultimately refuses him. It's safe to say that some of the anticipation here for Mr. Wong's new film, ''2046,'' a sequel to ''In the Mood for Love,'' has to do with audiences' desire to see Mr. Leung's enchanting character again.     They're in for a shock. In ''2046'' (Aug. 5), he plays what an earlier generation of women called a patent-leather man. Throwing his life away at a hot-sheets Hong Kong hotel called the Oriental, he's a charming smoothie, with slick black hair that catches the light and a cheesy, pencil-thin mustache. Last seen in ''In the Mood for Love'' confiding his heartbreak to Cambodia's ancient ruins, Chow was the ultimate romantic. In ''2046,'' romance is dead, and so is something in him.

Harold Arlen and Leo Robin have provided four lilting tunes—\\"For Every Man There's a Woman,\\" \\"Hooray for Love,\\" \\"It Was Written in the Stars\\" and \\"What's Good About Goodbye?\\"—and Mr. Martin does nobly by them. But the score, and Katherine Dunham and her dancers, stay rather than speed the story about the master thief who leaves the sleezy sanctuary of the Algerian \\"fortress\\" to meet death in the pursuit of his lady love.Marta Toren, a dark-haired Swedish newcomer, is the beautiful but somewhat unemotional object of Pepe's affections, while Yvonne De Carlo, is beautiful and a bit more emotional as his native girl friend. Hugo Haas plays a Casbah guide broadly and for laughs. Top acting honors, however, go to Peter Lorre as the ubiquitous Slimane. His police inspector is smooth, natural, underplayed and a worthy successor to the previous Slimanes. As Pepe, Tony Martin is handsome, dimpled and in good voice but it is difficult to perceive how those qualities extract such undying loyalty and protection from all those tough characters in the tough Casbah. One of the film's players also must have noticed it when he remarks, \\"I don't know what is so remarkable about Pepe.\\" We don't either.

Last month, a C.I.A. officer, Aldrich Ames, was arrested on charges of being a longtime Moscow mole. And from dark and secret waters there suddenly surfaced a previously unknown class of Navy submarines that for decades has apparently retrieved cold war booty from the abysses of the ocean floor. These echoes from the past prompt a question: Since the Soviet Union's foremost enemy was its own economic system, what difference did 45 years of intelligence operations really make to the outcome of the cold war?       In hot wars, it certainly helps to have spies to signal the enemy's intentions, like those who warned Stalin of Hitler's invasion plans","excerpt":"too bad that Stalin didn't believe them. But when the shooting stops, spy agencies seem to spend a lot of time just chasing each other rather than things that matter. The C.I.A. vigorously tries to penetrate the K.G.B. and G.R.U. -- several of the Russians whom Ames allegedly betrayed were counterintelligence officers, as was he. Moscow's prime target is the C.I.A. and National Security Agency. It's hard for outsiders to assess the importance of these cloak-and-dagger duels because the insiders so seldom tell the truth about them. But even the figures of speech in which they are usually described -- Russian matryoshka dolls, wildernesses of mirrors -- hint of much ado about not much.   My father worked in British counterintelligence, where one of his jobs was to monitor East European emigre communities in Britain. I assume he thwarted spy rings operating against Her Majesty's Government and tried to turn them against their own. He only once told me any operational detail of his activities. He came across a Czech or Hungarian spy ring that was reporting to an unusual master -- the American Embassy in London. This was unfortunate, since the United States and Britain had agreed they would not run such operations on each other's soil. As my father told the story, he called in the C.I.A. station chief and laid out the evidence before him. \\"Gee, Michael,\\" the man replied, \\"is my face red.\\"   Spies are embarrassments when caught. Even with those who survive detection, fidelity cannot always be assumed, since changing masters tends to be addictive. Satellites, at first blush, have none of these frailties. They never switch allegiances or fall into sex-baited honey traps. Resembling the Hubble Space Telescope, except that they point not up to distant galaxies but down to dirty laundry, these delicate instruments provide streams of good-as-eyewitness information.   But satellites have their own limitations. Their costs, mercifully hidden in black budgets, are probably huge. They have doubtless suffered their share of setbacks, like the Hubble telescope. They can photograph the ground from their lofty orbits as well as low-flying planes can, but unlike planes, they follow predictable orbits. Devious minds seek to trick them, whether with decoys or by timing activities so no satellites are overhead. The Soviet preparation to move an army into Afghanistan was apparently undetected by satellites. So, for many years, was the Krasnoyarsk missile-detecting radar, a large and illegal edifice being constructed nakedly on a site prohibited by treaty.    Maybe more productive means of cold war espionage than either spies or satellites will prove to have been methods like signals intelligence, a less glamorous art about which little is on public record, and the Navy's salvage submarines. This fleet's existence was first reported last month by William J. Broad in The New York Times, although a few of its activities were already known. The submarines, in principle, can monitor anything that drops into the sea or runs across the ocean floor. Unlike many spies, their targets were items of direct strategic importance. Unlike satellites, they can reach down and examine their targets of interest.    Converted for use after retirement from other duties, the submarines' special equipment includes thrusters to keep them poised above their target and giant spools carrying miles of cable. The cables plummet to the ocean floor, presumably carrying devices like lights, cameras, manipulators and collectors. Unlike surface ships, the submarines can operate undetected over sensitive sites.   One submarine, the Halibut, visited the Soviet Golf-2 class nuclear-armed submarine that sank in 1968 near Hawaii and that was salvaged six years later by the Glomar Explorer. The Halibut apparently did so good a job that the Navy and Defense Intelligence Agency doubted the need being asserted by the C.I.A. to build the Glomar Explorer for a further visit. \\"Optimum recovery of intelligence information from this accident was achieved,\\" the former Navy official who planned the Halibut mission wrote to Congress.   The harvest of the Halibut and its cousins is a matter of the purest speculation. The Navy has admitted to nothing. But in the case of the Golf-2 submarine the phrase \\"optimum recovery of intelligence information\\" suggests booty of some strategic weight.    Nuclear warheads are one such item. The Soviet Union is thought to have lost about 40 at sea, according to William M. Arkin of Greenpeace.  Dr. Theodore B. Taylor, a former nuclear weapons designer at Los Alamos, pointed out that \\"bombs can be very different from one another\\" in a recent discussion of what might have been recovered from the Golf-2 submarine. \\"There's a good chance Soviet weaponry held big surprises for us.\\"    Another prize, the guidance units of the warhead's missiles, would yield data about the missiles' accuracy. Sunken submarines might also yield code rooms and cryptographic gear.    Besides submarines, the ocean floor holds test missiles that fell short of their target and communications links like undersea cables. Ivy Bells, an eavesdropping project revealed to the Soviet Union by a National Security Agency employee, Ronald W. Pelton, is reported to have involved a large eavesdropping pod, placed round a Soviet cable carrying military communications in the Sea of Okhotsk. The Navy's submarines, whether of the Halibut or some other type, retrieved tapes from the pod, now a prime exhibit in the Moscow museum founded by the K.G.B.    The submarines' take from the ocean floor surely enhanced national security. Whether they or any other means of intelligence collection made a decisive difference in the cold war seems less certain. The C.I.A., according to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a former vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, reckoned that the Soviet G.N.P. was roughly three times as large as it turned out to be. The agency thus missed the most critical secret of all -- that the Soviet economy could not support the Soviet empire. Beside this mountainous destructive force, a regiment of moles burrowing away in Moscow or Washington added up merely to molehills.

In his new film, ''Port Djema,'' the sound of a single gunshot on the nearly empty streets of an African town is absolutely horrifying.

Pierre Feldman (Jean-Yves Dubois), a French surgeon with better things to do, travels to Port Djema, a fictional African nation, because he made a promise to a dear friend, a doctor who was recently killed there.

The film purports to have a plot, but it's only a riddle (who is the mystery child?), introduced briefly and almost immediately solved and tossed away.    A Doctor's Dilemma in an African State"},{"year":"2006","title":"THE BASICS -- The city's Addison Mizner-designed pride and joy, the nearly eight-decade-old Boca Raton Resort and Club is part living history, part work in progress. In recent years, the 356-acre convention-friendly resort has undergone more than $100 million in renovations -- work is still continuing, sometimes almost intrusively so -- and has been taken over by new owners. Accommodations are spread over five main areas -- the Mediterranean-style Cloister (359 rooms) that's the resort's historic Mizner core, plus the more contemporary-minded Tower (244 rooms), Boca Beach Club (212 rooms), Boca Bungalows (120 rooms) and Yacht Club (112 rooms). The Cloister is the most impressive: Think of a palazzo masquerading as a hotel, with architectural touches ranging from fountains to detailed mosaics. The resort's beach area is like a private club unto itself","excerpt":"too bad the stretch of sand isn't particularly wide.    THE LOCATION -- In a quiet area slightly removed from the city's small downtown and the popular Mizner Park outdoor shopping center. The resort itself is so large that it takes up space on both sides of the Intracoastal Waterway. Shuttle service is provided by ferry or bus.    THE ROOMS -- History has a price, and it's not simply a matter of costly accommodations. Rather, our fifth-floor room in the Cloister, done in a style that might be described as the French-court-meets-tropics, was musty and looking well past its prime, even though it was nicely appointed with a plush king-size bed (we loved the neck roll), writing desk and large closet area with a sink and a minibar. The more noticeable problems included threadbare carpeting, rusty hinges and a window that came out of its frame upon opening (we quickly fixed it ourselves). We took a peek at a room at the Beach Club and found it much more up-to-date and the style more sophisticated. The good news is that the Cloister rooms are getting a makeover by Alexandra Champalimaud, an interior designer who specializes in hotels; plans call for them to be redone in a ''light and uncomplicated'' palette by early summer.    THE BATHROOM -- Decent sized, but nothing to get particularly excited about. The frosted-gray marble fixtures were attractive, but they were offset by a hideously old rubber bath mat and caulking applied in a slipshod manner.    AMENITIES -- There's plenty to do here, albeit with an added cost. Golf (two 18-hole courses; $160 a person, plus a $27 cart fee) and tennis (30 courts; $12 to $18 for a day pass) are the big highlights, but there's also a spa, six pools, three fitness centers, full-service marina, even croquet. We also simply liked taking the ferry from the resort's mainland side (where the Cloister is situated) to the beach. There were plenty of dining options, too, though we weren't overly impressed with our expensive dinner (more than $200 for two) at 27 Ocean Blue, the resort's top-of-the-Tower restaurant. The Oysters Rockefeller ($24) were good, but the marinated hanger steak ($32) and the chocolate dessert platter ($9) were unremarkable; the real reason to come is for the fabulous waterfront view. To make matters worse, the young bartender was clueless about how to make our favorite cocktail, a Negroni, which is made of equal parts gin, Campari and sweet vermouth. (The resort will be soon adding a new restaurant, a branch of New York's Old Homestead Steakhouse.)    ROOM SERVICE -- Speedy and efficient. Our breakfast was promised in 30 minutes, and arrived in 25. For $73.38 for two, it could hardly be called affordable, but we loved the blueberry pancakes and the resort's signature orange, passion fruit and strawberry juice blend, and the kitchen granted our off-the-menu request for an egg-white omelet.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- The Boca Raton Resort & Club (501 East Camino Real, 561-447-3000 or 888-491-2622; online at www.bocaresort.com) may have history on its side, but some of its accommodations are definitely due for that scheduled facelift. Rates vary depending on season and accommodations, but range from $185 to $775.

The other half? They're dead -- mute evidence of how shamefully long it's taken the United States to make amends.    Internment was President Roosevelt's panicky response to Pearl Harbor, to racial prejudice and to understandable but wholly ill-founded fears that Japanese-Americans posed a security threat. The United States also seized property worth $400 million.   After decades of lobbying by Japanese groups, Congress in 1988 authorized a formal apology and payment of $20,000 for each internee. But it did not appropriate any funds until this year and the survivors won't be fully compensated until 1993.    The $20,000 is little enough, and the long delay adds a further insult to a group of people who, history shows, were wholly innocent.

HIGH SCHOOL: Salesian, New Rochelle.  JOB: Kiddyland ride operator at Playland in Rye.  HOURS: 20 to 25 a week, for 4 months. Plans to work weekends through mid-October. Time sick, late or on vacation: Never sick or     late","excerpt":"took a week off for a family vacation on the Jersey Shore.  TOTAL EARNINGS: Just over $1,000.  SPENT ON: About half went to a savings account and will be put toward car insurance. Much of the rest was used for transportation to and from work, as well as tickets to go on the park's rides. Biggest purchases were a CD player and a pair of sneakers.  COMMUTING TIME: An hour and a half each way on the bus.  HARDEST PART OF JOB: ''Standing out in the 100-degree heat, listening to the disgruntled customers. And trying to get people to obey the rules, like if they wanted to go on a ride but they didn't have enough points. It was hard to say no sometimes. But I learned.''  WHAT HE'LL MISS MOST: Being in charge of the rides and seeing regular customers . ''It was my hobby. This is something I've always wanted to do. It's getting to work with every kind of person you can imagine and getting to make people smile.''  FUNNIEST MOMENT: The time he ran to let anxious children into a ride, but tripped and nearly fell on top of a chair. ''The kids and     parents were just laughing for along time. I had to laugh, too.''  LESSON(S) LEARNED: ''A lot about parenting. How to watch a dozen kids all at once and make sure that they are safe and having     fun.''  JOB PLANS FOR NEXT SUMMER: ''Definitely Playland.''  ULTIMATE JOB PLANS: Journalist.    Ghaneisha Ford, 15    HOME: Peekskill.  HIGH SCHOOL: Peekskill High.  JOB: Youth program coordinator at Peekskill Youth Center.  HOURS: 35 a week, for 10 weeks.  TIME SICK, LATE OR ON VACATION: None.  TOTAL EARNINGS: About $1,800.  SPENT ON: ''Shoes, shoes and more shoes.'' About half the money has gone on clothes and sneakers, including Akademiks, epe     and Adidas. ''I still have some more shopping to do.''  COMMUTING TIME: Five minutes' walk each way.  HARDEST PART OF JOB: There wasn't one. The things she expected to be most challenging, like creating spreadsheets and dealing with young children, ''were really easy and calm'' after all.  WHAT SHE'LL MISS MOST: Supervising middle-school-age children as they planted flowers and worked to clean up the neighborhood. ''They always had something smart to say. A couple of them thought they were real comedians.''  FUNNIEST MOMENT: Watching the children perform for parents one night at the center. ''A couple of the little boys from one group     performed a step routine, and they just cracked themselves up. They looked like little clowns.''  LESSON(S) LEARNED: How to use more computer programs and project a positive attitude at all times. ''That's always how Miss     Valerie was,'' she said, referring to her boss, Valerie Swan, head of the city's youth bureau. ''She was always lifting you up.'' Others at the Youth Center took to calling Ghaneisha ''Young Ms. Swan,'' a title she does not seem to mind.  JOB PLANS FOR NEXT SUMMER: Helping run another program for local schoolchildren.  ULTIMATE JOB PLANS: Teacher.    Alison Leventhal, 17    HOME: Chappaqua.  HIGH SCHOOL: Horace Greeley High.  JOB: Editorial intern at Harry N. Abrams Inc., art-book publisher in Manhattan.  HOURS: 35 hours a week, for 8 weeks.  TIME SICK, LATE OR ON VACATION: Two days sick, never late. Stopped work with enough time left to make college visits before start of school.  TOTAL EARNINGS: $500, a surprise stipend at the end of the summer.  SPENT ON: A digital camera for $250; she is holding onto the rest. ''My boss told me I had to spend it on something fun for myself, and not save it for college.''  COMMUTING TIME: 50 minutes each way on Metro-North.  HARDEST PART OF JOB: Writing sales pitches to museums around the country for Abrams books. ''I didn't want to seem like a bad writer, and I had to be creative with what I said.''  WHAT SHE'LL MISS MOST: ''The city, riding the subway, listening to my iPod. I liked that I could navigate through everything on my own. I didn't know how to do that before. I'll miss being able to walk down the street and see something new everyday.''  FUNNIEST MOMENT: Opening the office refrigerator and taking out a carton of milk for her coffee, only to have another woman approach her, look annoyed and say, ''I'll take that when you are done.'' ''I realized then that people buy milk for themselves.''  LESSON(S) LEARNED: ''There's a lot of sucking up, and there's no saying no. There's no complaining. You just say O.K. nicely and do what you are asked. I would do whatever they made me do, but they made it fun.''  JOB PLANS FOR NEXT SUMMER: Another internship at Abrams or another city company. ''Maybe they'll pay me more. Or maybe     I'll just take next summer off.''  ULTIMATE JOB PLANS: Psychologist or journalist.    Galo Trujillo, 17    HOME: Mount Kisco.  SCHOOL: Fox Lane High.  JOB: Intern at State Senator Jeff Klein's district office in the Bronx.  HOURS: 34 a week, for 8 weeks. Time sick, late or on vacation: Had to leave early twice to pick up his younger sister from camp.  TOTAL EARNINGS: $1,800 stipend from scholarship program.  SPENT ON: About $300 so far on back-toschool shopping. ''Nothing extravagant. Some jeans and stuff like that. But I'm not     done yet.''  COMMUTING TIME: Nearly two hours each way on Metro-North, the subway and the bus.  HARDEST PART OF JOB: ''Getting used to everything, learning what goes on in an office, and getting used to a political environment where all kinds of issues are discussed.''  WHAT HE'LL MISS MOST: ''Actually being able to help people. Researching their question or problem and then getting the answer. I like the craziness of it. Now I am going back to a regular school schedule. In the office, you never knew what was next.''  FUNNIEST MOMENT: Because of his desire to use his Spanish skills to help constituents overcome the language barrier, ''they would pass me the calls they thought were from Spanish speakers, because they had really heavy accents. I would talk to them in Spanish, and they would respond to me in English. I kept getting my hopes up and was let down every single time.''  LESSON(S) LEARNED: ''You just have to try and help people the best way you can. Constituent work means a lot of people come     into the office about a lot of things. I definitely know how to talk to people now.''  JOB PLANS FOR NEXT SUMMER: Another public-policy internship; ''a free summer looks kind of nice.''  ULTIMATE JOB PLANS: Politician or doctor.    Kyle Belluscio, 17    HOME: Yonkers.  SCHOOL: Fordham Preparatory.  JOB: Lifeguard at Saxon Woods Pool in White Plains.  HOURS: 40 a week, plus overtime, for eight weeks.  TIME SICK, LATE OR ON VACATION: Called in sick one day. Took three weeks off to go on class trip to Europe.  TOTAL EARNINGS: About $4,000.  SPENT ON: A lot of Chinese food, a few outfits for school. Plans to do more serious shopping when the weather cools down.  COMMUTING TIME: 15 minutes each way.  HARDEST PART OF JOB: Occasionally having to help remove feces from the pool and routinely having to listen to people's complaints. On one occasion, whenpatrons were told to get out of the pool because of a thunderstorm, a woman rushed up and angrily demanded: ''Thunder, where do you see thunder? I don't see no thunder!''  WHAT HE'LL MISS MOST: ''The best part of it is obvious. I was basically getting paid to sit around at the pool. It is work, but the weather is great. You get to be out in the sun all the time.''  FUNNIEST MOMENT: After a night of hanging out with friends from work, he was unable to find a ride back home to Yonkers. When he arrived at the pool the next day, he had no swimsuit and was forced to wear a pair of sweatpants that somebody had left in the lifeguard locker room. The temperature rose to nearly 100 degrees that day. ''People really thought that was funny. I was fine as long as kept jumping in the pool to get the pants wet.''  LESSON(S) LEARNED: ''How to deal with people, how to have patience and how to talk with them.''  JOB PLANS FOR NEXT SUMMER: ''I'll be back there next summer for sure.''  ULTIMATE JOB PLANS: Federal investigator or some other kind of law enforcement agent; physical trainer.

The cause was Tibet, and though many of the musicians might not have known previously about the conflicts between Tibetans and the Chinese Government, which has occupied the country since 1950, after the concert ended on Sunday several performers' eyes filled with tears as the monks  of Sera Je Monastery blessed them backstage and thanked them for donating their  time, music and sympathies.         Of course, the majority of audience members attended the concert for the music bill, which mixed popular alternative rockers (the Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth, Bjork), crossover rappers (the Fugees, A Tribe Called Quest, De La  Soul), bands that mix rock and rap (Beastie Boys, Rage Against the Machine, Beck, Cibo Matto) and a few old-timers (John Lee Hooker, Richie Havens, Yoko Ono, the Skatalites).

Jr. Co-founder and chairman emeritus of Kepner-Tregoe, Inc., died on April 20, 2005 of complications from nonHodgkins lymphoma. He was 77. In 1958, Dr. Tregoe and Dr. Charles H. Kepner left the RAND Corporation, where they worked as systems researchers, to found KepnerTregoe and Associates, Inc. Innovative pioneers, the two social scientists conducted original research with major corporations and discovered a core set of analytical problem-solving and decisionmaking processes that continue to be recognized as universally valid. Today, 400 of the 1,000 largest corporations worldwide use Kepner-Tregoe management methods. Their company, which later became Kepner-Tregoe, Inc., is headquartered in Princeton, NJ and conducts business in over 50 countries and 20 languages. Since its inception, Kepner-Tregoe has transferred its problem-solving, decision-making, and planning approaches to millions of managers. Dr. Tregoe and his colleague, John W. Zimmerman, also developed a process for strategic decision making that has helped many top management teams set and implement strategy. Dr. Tregoe provided the inspiration and leadership for Kepner-Tregoe over many years. He held a firm belief in the quality and depth of development for every associate as they delivered Kepner Tregoe's services to clients. He was conceptionally brilliant, a tough questioner, and a sensitive counselor. Dr. Tregoe and his company have been a significant force in organization development, pioneering both the train-thetrainer approach and process consulting, both of which have become common practice. He was elected to the Human Resource Development Hall of Fame. Dr. Tregoe was a leading lecturer and published extensively in journals throughout the world. His first book, The Rational Manager, which was co-authored with Dr. Kepner in 1965, is recognized as a landmark publication in the field of management methodology. He also co-authored The New Rational Manager: An Updated Edition for a New World (1997)","excerpt":"Top Management Strategy: What It Is and How to Make It Work (1980); Vision in Action: Putting a Winning Strategy to Work (1989); The Culture of Success: Building a Sustained Competitive Advantage by Living Your Corporate Beliefs (1997); and Analytic Processes for School Leaders (2001). In 1993, Dr. Tregoe realized a long-held dream when he established the Tregoe Education Forum. This nonprofit organization provides students in middle and high schools with the critical-thinking skills needed to effectively solve problems, make decisions, and work together. Dr. Tregoe was born in San Francisco on December 23, 1927. He graduated from Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California in 1945. After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, he received his bachelor's degree from Whittier College and a Ph.D. in sociology from Harvard University. He also received an honorary LL.D. from Whittier College, where he served as a trustee and a board member. He was a member of the board of directors of The J.M. Smucker Company, the National Alliance of Business, The World Affairs Council of Philadelphia, and the Princeton Day School. He served as chairman of an advisory committee to the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. He is a past member of the Young Presidents' Organization, where he served as international education chairman and a member of the board, and a member of the Chief Executives' Organization. Dr. Tregoe is survived by his wife, Jeannette Tregoe; two daughters, Cynthia Richetti and Elizabeth Gonzalez; one son, Benjamin B. Tregoe III; and two grandchildren, Kaleigh and Gavin Richetti.
