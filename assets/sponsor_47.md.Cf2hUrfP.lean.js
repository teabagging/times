And it isn't very often these students - some of them my own - have a chance at letting go.   A student puts his arm around my shoulders and kisses me on the cheek.

Equally significant is the fact that, starting in the late spring of 1983, rising rates presaged a retreat in equity prices.   This latest surge in interest rates, catching most forecasters by surprise, sent bond prices down and bond yields up.

HUGHES, 60, a Democrat. The incumbent, he has represented the district for 18 years. Was an assistant prosecutor in Cape May County for a decade before that. FRANK LoBIONDO, 46, a Republican. Elected as State Assemblyman in 1987. Had been a Cumberland County Freeholder for 3 years. Operations manager for a family-owned trucking business. The District  The Second is the state's largest congressional district, sprawling over six counties, from the Delaware River to the Atlantic Ocean. The vast majority of residents are white, and among voters, Republicans outnumber Democrats, 82,000 to 65,000. But the largest group of voters -- more than 138,000 -- are unaffiliated. The Issues  Gun control has become a significant issue in the race because the two men have very different views. Mr. Hughes, a gun-control advocate who has written several major anti-crime bills as chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on crime -- he has since switched to the subcommittee on courts, intellectual property and judicial administration -- has emphasized Mr. LoBiondo's support from the National Rifle Association, which despises Mr. Hughes and applauds Mr. LoBiondo for his sponsorship of a measure to repeal Gov. Jim Florio's ban on assault weapons in the Legislature.   Mr. LoBiondo has assailed Mr. Hughes for votes against the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and in favor of the Congressional pay raise, as well as his acceptance of such Congressional perks as a taxpayer- provided automobile. Analysis  Mr. Hughes's self-effacing popularity and attention to the district -- he has spent few weekends in Washington during his long tenure -- have made him all but unbeatable. Despite Mr. LoBiondo's aggressive campaign, the incumbent's roots in the district give him the edge. 6TH DISTRICT: MONMOUTH, MIDDLESEX The Candidates FRANK PALLONE JR., 40, Democrat. Lawyer and former Long Branch City Councilman and state legislator. Elected to Congress in 1988. JOSEPH M. KYRILLOS JR., 32, Republican. A State Senator and former member of the General Assembly. Manager of business standards and ethics for the Mid-Atlantic Health Group, a hospital management company in Rumson. The District   The new Sixth District is an amalgam of two areas: the northern half of Mr. Pallone's old Third District along the Jersey Shore, and southern and central Middlesex County from the old Sixth District, which was represented for the last 12 years by Bernard J. Dwyer, who has retired. The southern end of the district begins in Sea Girt, an affluent oceanfront town, and heads north and then west into industrial Middlesex County, which makes up 58 percent of the district and gives it a blue-collar and Democratic cast.  The Issues   Mr. Kyrillos has been basing his campaign on voter frustration over the economy and the resulting anti-incumbency mood. He said he recognized that much of the anger was aimed at President Bush, whom he supports, but that voters should remember the role of Congress. He characterizes Mr. Pallone, who attracts many large donations from political action committees, as \\"the ultimate insider.\\"   Mr. Pallone calls himself a \\"maverick\\" and repeats that he was the only member of the New Jersey delegation to vote against the last Congressional pay raise in 1989. He has won the support of national and state environmental organizations for his sponsorship of clean-water legislation in the State Legislature and Congress.   Both men support abortion rights, although Mr. Pallone was a strong opponent of abortion before changing his position three years ago. Analysis   Mr. Pallone has raised five times more money over the last two years than Mr. Kyrillos, who entered the race only last spring. The edge in financing and the strong showing of Gov. Bill Clinton in the Presidential race have helped install Mr. Pallone as the favorite. With Mr. Bush closing the gap in recent days, Mr. Kyrillos has been attracting new support and exhibiting increased enthusiasm as the race ends. Still, a Kyrillos victory would be considered an upset. 7TH DISTRICT: ESSEX, MIDDLESES, SOMERSET, UNION The Candidates   ROBERT D. FRANKS, 41, Republican. A member of the Assembly since 1979. Twice served as chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee.  LEONARD R. SENDELSKY, 58, Democrat. A house builder who founded his own company in 1958. Has never run for office. One of the state's major fund-raisers for Democratic candidates. The District   The newly redrawn district, for 20 years the fief of Representative Matthew J. Rinaldo, a Republican, stretches across northern New Jersey and is one of the most ethnically diverse in the state.  The Issues   Neither candidate has found a specific issue to exploit. Instead each has focused on portraying himself as a Washington outsider intent on reforming Congress, while painting his opponent as a political insider. Analysis   Representative Rinaldo surprised everyone when he announced his retirement just days before the filing deadline for the election. With no incumbent and a new district, this is one of the most unpredictable races in the state. After winning the Democratic nomination, Mr. Sendelsky spent much of his effort compiling material for a race against Mr. Rinaldo. Nearly all of it became useless. Mr. Franks's campaign had a late start. Each candidate has claimed to hold a slight edge, while worrying about the outcome. 8TH DISTRICT: ESSEX, PASSAIC The Candidates JOSEPH L. BUBBA, 54, Republican. He was elected to the State Senate in 1981. He also served as Passaic County Freeholder and Passaic County Republican chairman in the mid 1970's and early 80's. HERBERT C. KLEIN, 62, Democrat. A lawyer, he served in the State Assembly from 1971 to 1976 when he was defeated in his bid for a third term. As executive director of the Passaic County Democratic Committee, he has remained politically active. He is also one of the biggest fund-raisers for Democratic candidates and causes in the state. The District   With the voting-age population almost equally divided between urban and areas, blue-collar bedroom communities and wealthy mountainside suburbs, the 8th is one of the most varied political districts in the state. Democrats outnumber Republicans, 92,000 to nearly 55,000. But in recent national and statewide elections, an unaffiliated bloc of voters, now numbering about 125,000, have given the edge to Republican candidates. About 70 percent of residents are white, with large blocs of second-generation immigrants. Blacks make up about 15 percent of residents, with most concentrated in two cities, Paterson and Passaic. The Issues   Mr. Bubba, a conservative who prides himself on never having voted for a tax increase in 11 years in Trenton, has attacked Mr. Klein for voting for the state income tax when he was a member of the Assembly in 1976. Mr. Bubba also highlights his tough stance in the Legislature against crime. Mr. Klein argues that he is \\"not a career politician who has lost touch with ordinary people.\\" He also assails Mr. Bubba for accepting contributions from the National Rifle Association and supporting the overturn of the state's ban on assault firearms. Analysis    When Robert A. Roe, a very popular Republican, announced he would not run again after 22 years in Congress, the district turned into a battleground for the first time in two decades. Mr. Bubba has the edge in name recognition, and is thus favored, but the race at this point is considered too close to call.  13TH DISTRICT: HUDSON, ESSEX, MIDDLESEX, UNION The Candidates ROBERT MENENDEZ, 38. Mayor of Union City since 1986. Was serving his second term in the State Assembly when selected to fill a vacant State Senate seat in February 1991","excerpt":"was elected to a two-year term in the Senate in November. FRED G. THEEMLING JR., 48. Lawyer and former assistant Hudson County prosecutor. Tried unsucessfully to unseat the retiring incumbent Congressman, Frank Guarini, in 1988 and 1990. The District   The 13th was drawn after the 1990 Census, when New Jersey lost one seat, and comprises working-class, urban areas. Was drawn to maximize Hispanic voter strength; about 43 percent of the district is Hispanic. The Issues   Both candidates have focused on jobs, the economy, health-care costs and crime. Mr. Menendez's \\"urban agenda\\" would focus on tax incentives for new development and job-training in urban areas. Both candidates favor urban enterprise zones; Mr. Theemling would also grant tax breaks to companies that hire new workers and raise taxes on businesses that lay off workers to make a profit. Analysis   Mr. Menendez, the Democrat, is the heavy favorite in a district where Democrats far outnumber Republicans. Besides outspending Mr. Theemling by more than 15 to one, he has received all the major endorsements. He is a Cuban-American and many Cuban-American voters in the district, who tend to vote Republican, are expected to support him. He would become New Jersey's first Hispanic representative in Congress.   Mr. Theemling's hope is that the anti-politician, anti-incumbency sentiment in the district will work in his favor.

Disco wasn't entirely without variety; the beat carried touches of big bands, doo-wop vocal harmonies, gospel and torch singing. But music so committed to the pop moment didn't have much shelf life.
