But he had to wait until he was in his late 60's, after 20 years of virtual retirement, before he found the audience that had slipped through his fingers earlier. He was lured back to performing in the early 90's by the encouragement of fellow singers like Ruth Brown, who had also gone through a period of rejection after early success. He made a widely acclaimed debut at the Supper Club last spring, and is back for an engagement through Nov. 20. His shows are at 8 and 10 P.M. tonight and tomorrow night.

But even more than money, an Oscar usually represents a vote from the heart, and that is not a good thing. The best-picture winner is often a movie with a marshmallow soul and a brain to match.     Following a pattern that goes way back, tear-jerkers, soap operas and feel-good films end up overtaking serious, substantial contenders. One of the more outrageous examples comes from 1994, when the gushy ''Forrest Gump'' (talk about a mush-brained movie) won over two far better, more substantial nominees: Robert Redford's elegant and socially conscious ''Quiz Show'' and Quentin Tarantino's bloody but invigorating ''Pulp Fiction.'' That season was typical. During the run-up to the Oscars, critics' groups will recognize a serious or innovative work -- the New York Film Critics Circle chose ''Quiz Show'' as its best picture, and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association honored ''Pulp Fiction'' -- helping to place the film in Oscar contention, only to have an emotionally easier movie swoop in and carry off the prize.

His father was killed before Timmie was born and his mother (Laraine Day) is busy running an advertising agency.Timmie is tired of listening to the other boys' stories of their dads, especially the one about the ex-All-America football player. So he invents a father. Not just an ordinary father but one who is a noted explorer. And not just an ordinary noted explorer, either. Timmie's \\"dad\\" makes Frank Buck and Admiral Byrd look like boy scouts. And Timmie has a roomful of trophies to prove it.But one of the boys thinks Timmie has quite an imagination and taunts him into the put-up-or-shut-up stage. Luckily, Miss Day's bachelor art director, Jeff Chandler, happens to pop into Winawatamie and Timmie makes his pitch.Mr. Chandler doesn't accept the transformation to father-explorer without a struggle, but master-schemer Timmie, with those mischievous, downcast eyes, could melt anyone.After a while some of the adults get in the way of \\"Toy Tiger,\\" but with Timmie, his classmates and wonderfully scatterbrained headmasters Richard Haydn and Cecil Kellaway it's on the right track.
