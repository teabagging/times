On Tuesday the first hour of ''Race'' was solidly beaten by Fox's ''House'' (14.52 million viewers) at 9 p.m., but was able to win the 10 p.m. hour among total viewers against a repeat ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' (11.14 million) on NBC and a new ''Boston Legal'' (9.92 million) on ABC. CBS's average was bolstered by its leadoff show, ''NCIS,'' which brought in 16.77 million viewers. Fox placed a solid second for the night over all.

Its lineup was particularly strong, and, in total, it was CBS's biggest Thursday of the season so far. On ''Survivor,'' which drew an audience of 20.38 million, four contestants now remain to be whittled down during tomorrow's finale: Stephenie LaGrossa, a popular contestant brought back from the previous season of the show, is one of them. Thursday's ''CSI,'' with 30.8 million viewers, was the most-watched episode of the forensics crime show since last November. And ''Without a Trace'' delivered its best 18-to-49 ratings of the season.  Sci Fi Channel's three-night miniseries ''The Triangle,'' which ran Monday through Wednesday, attracted an average of 4.2 million viewers. Its biggest night was Monday, when Part 1 drew 4.31 million viewers. It was Sci Fi's highest-rated mini-series since ''Steven Spielberg Presents Taken'' in December 2002.

William C. Westmoreland's claims of victory in his two-and-a-half year battle with CBS to save his honor and punish the network to the tune of $120 million. The network has indeed won. The general has capitulated. But there is something unpleasant about the way CBS is gloating in victory.  In their joint statement, CBS and General Westmoreland said they ''believe that their respective positions have been effectively placed before the public.'' That is probably true. But it has been done at a cost of millions of dollars and considerable anguish on both sides. That alone makes gloating seem inappropriate.  In fact, had ''The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception,'' the documentary over which the court battle was fought, been produced in a less polemical fashion, with more concern for standards of fairness, the public would undoubtedly have been better served and the lawsuit would probably have been avoided.  The reason is that CBS almost certainly misled viewers by reducing an extremely complex situation to an unrealistically simple thesis - that General Westmoreland ''cooked the books,'' conspiring to deceive the President about enemy troop strength so that he could continue pursuing an immoral and unwinnable war.  Even if you buy the CBS thesis, as some knowledgeable observers do, the question still arises, why produce the show in such a one-sided way? After all, there are many equally knowledgeable observers who consider the thesis absurd in its simplicity. 4 VERDICTS ON THE WESTMORELAND CASE AGAINST CBS","excerpt":"CBS ISN'T BLAMELESS"},{"year":"1966","title":"CBS Labs develops metal disk that reproduces motion pictures through TV set (J Gould rept)","excerpt":"CBS Labs silent C.B.S.

NBC's ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' (15.6 million) did manage to win the 10 p.m. hour among 18-to-49-year-olds, but the rest of the night belonged to CBS.

Now Michael Jackson, already the highest paid performer in the record business, may be about to set off a new wave of me-too pay increases in his industry with what is said to be the most lucrative deal in music history.    People with knowledge of Mr. Jackson's negotiations with CBS Records said last week that the singer could make much more per album than the $18 million advance against royalties that he would receive for the final album under his current contract.    Befitting the ephemeral world of pop music, the bargaining between Mr. Jackson and CBS is impelled by more than mere supply and demand. Mr. Jackson, who already has a net worth of more than $100 million, wants to remain the highest paid singer in the business","excerpt":"CBS wants the cachet of having him remain on its Epic label, even though experts say the company would have to sell six million to seven million copies of each album just to break even under the new deal.

There was among them for the first time a player, Robin Yount of Milwaukee, who earned more than $3 million.

By sheer coincidence, CBS's audience has always been the oldest among the networks. For the last eight years, Mr. Poltrack, 46, has been the most quoted font of numbers in the television business -- always in the loyal service of his network.

Amateurism was their byword -- it seemed the person with the worst voice was the one picked to sing -- and they were rebels serious about not taking themselves seriously. The blunt confessional \\"Never Been in a Riot\\" was their first single. As punk petered out and the first round of electronic dance music began in Britain, the Mekons moved with the times. In this early-80's phase, they turned out a series of draggy numbers with a heavy beat and hectoring lyrics.

She never embellishes her vocals with flamboyant effects in the manner of Chaka Khan or breaks her message down to scat singing as Regina Belle or Anita Baker often do. On the down-home gospel song \\"I've Been Through It,\\" she starts to shout gleefully, as Aretha Franklin might, but then cuts short each of her flourishes, letting her words carry the action. She takes the time to argue her point, detail by detail, in \\"Good Morning Heartache,\\" \\"This Bitter Earth\\" and \\"Hope That We Can Be Together Soon,\\" addressing the listener so realistically that it doesn't matter how Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington and Sharon Page (with Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes) interpreted the original versions.\\n\\nMost of today's divas lose their balance in response to funky rhythms; not Howard. With purposeful rigor she wraps her voice tightly around the words of \\"Ain't Nobody Like You,\\" \\"Release Me\\" and \\"Cigarette Ashes on the Floor,\\" limiting each syllable to one passion and one beat. Howard's deep simplicity shows up the baggy-clothed clutter of much of today's pop for the cynical manipulation it is.

This is the case with the American star David Byrne and the Brazilian Tom Ze. Ze is exactly the type of musician -- reclusive, with a subtle acumen -- that needs celebrity sponsorship, and his work justifies Byrne's enthusiasm.   \\"The Hips of Tradition\\" is less polished than 1990's \\"Best of Tom Ze\\" and sometimes has the loose feel of rough sketches. The irregular meters and Ze's odd moans suggest parodies of peppery sambas and languid bossa novas. At times, the tunes tick along with the combined whimsy of Erik Satie and Captain Beefheart.   Like many of the local pop progressives, Ze ponders Brazil's riotous juxtapositions of poverty and high technology, science fiction and prehistory. More explicitly than any of his peers, however, Ze's music proudly embodies the disquieting jostle of what he calls \\"Jungle de Disco.\\" RECORD BRIEFS"},{"year":"1992","title":"Shirley Horn: 'Here's to Life -- Shirley Horn With Strings'   Verve 314 511 879-2","excerpt":"CD and cassette.   TXT>   Because she has always been a voice of quiet in a pop-jazz climate of vivid, competing personalities, Shirley Horn has had to wait longer than most for popular recognition, which finally arrived last year with her album \\"You Won't Forget Me.\\" Her latest album, \\"Here's to Life,\\" a subdued collection of ballads beautifully arranged by Johnny Mandel, is likely to expand the reputation of this Washington-based singer and pianist, who recently turned 58.    Unlike such distinguished peers as Abbey Lincoln and Betty Carter, Ms. Horn projects little overt passion. Instead, her singing conveys a calm, meditative wisdom deepened by a dreamy, understated sensuality. That reflectiveness is underscored by impressionistic pianism that makes expressive use of pauses and empty spaces. The voice is so intimately attached to the piano that the two often seem to be engaged in a private musical dialogue.    Mr. Mandel, an arranger known for his artful diffusion of orchestral colors, has been careful not to obscure the individual voices in Ms. Horn's trio, which besides her own piano includes Charles Ables on bass and Steve Williams on drums. Two cuts feature silvery trumpet solos by Wynton Marsalis.    The result is an album that is as languid as it is lush, with 8 of its 11 cuts running more than five minutes. The inclusion of two Dmitri Tiomkin film themes, \\"Wild Is the Wind\\" and \\"Return to Paradise,\\" plus the Edith Piaf ballad \\"If You Love Me,\\" tilts the record's emotional center of gravity toward the 1950's. At the same time, the inclusion of ruminative ballads like Artie Butler and Phyllis Molinary's \\"Here's to Life,\\" and \\"Where Do You Start?\\" by Mr. Mandel and Alan and Marilyn Bergman, give the album a serene, retrospective mood. Or as the opening lines of the title cut put it: \\"No complaints and no regrets/ I still believe in chasing dreams and placing bets.\\" RECORD BRIEFS"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD:  CLASSICAL  Copland: 'Appalachian Spring' Suite, 'Short Symphony' and Other Works  Orpheus Chamber Orchestra.

No punk rock band has ever matched the jagged, acerbic fury of the riffs Williams played 35 years ago. No rapper has approached his ability to evoke the torment of life in prison or bend language to cast an eerie spell over a chance encounter with a seductive woman. Williams could improvise precise, topical blues numbers with remarkable spontaneity. He had never been recorded when he was discovered in Angola penitentiary in Louisiana, convicted of murder. Like the country blues titan Leadbelly, Williams even sang his way to freedom.   Yet he was no more than a moderate success on the folk-revival circuit in the 1960's, and the very density and originality of his blues must have been part of the reason. His decision to take up the slide guitar was also ill-advised. Today he is a shadowy memory, unknown outside blues circles. The release of Williams's prison recordings in 1959 caused a sensation with an earlier generation of fans. By rights, equal excitement should greet the recent reissue of most of his earliest sides along with more than a dozen unreleased tunes on \\"I'm as Blue as a Man Can Be\\" (Arhoolie 394","excerpt":"CD and cassette) and \\"When a Man Takes the Blues\\" (Arhoolie 395, CD and cassette).

During the late 60's blues boom, Mr. Seals and Mr. Ward were too young and too busy serving respective apprenticeships on the road and in the recording studio to share in the critical and commercial lionization of such elder statesmen as Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson and Howlin' Wolf. Over the next two decades, they were bypassed by the mainstream music industry, recording for small independent labels, if at all.\\n\\nToday, Mr. Seals, who turns 49 this month, and Mr. Ward, who is 52, are a bit too long in the tooth to pass for members of the \\"young lions\\" club headed by Robert Cray. They are also too set in their rugged purism to qualify as crossover candidates. However, on their new albums -- Mr. Seals's \\"Living in the Danger Zone\\" (Alligator AL 4798","excerpt":"CD and cassette) and Mr. Ward's \\"Fear No Evil\\" (Black Top BT-1063; CD and cassette) -- both men defy that generation gap with bristling guitar work and robust vocal performances that belie their years.

An acid casualty whose drug misadventures led to a four-year stay at a Texas mental hospital, Mr. Erickson is also a gifted singer-songwriter who, as a member of the Austin-based band 13th Floor Elevators, was instrumental in the creation of psychedelic rock. Singing in the tremulous, incantatory full-moon howl of a teen-age werewolf, he brought a naive, mystic zeal to the Elevators' surging blend of garage-rock spunk and hallucinogenic flash (their trademark was the spooky percolating of an electric jug). Mr. Erickson also wrote the Elevators' 1966 debut, \\"You're Gonna Miss Me,\\" one of the first Top 40 psychedelic hits.\\n\\nFollowing his hospital release in 1972, Mr. Erickson's songwriting took a turn for the macabre, combining grim grade-B horror-movie images and Dylanesque wordplay.

Compared to the guitar, the piano has always been a kind of stepchild of rock.

And for reasons that have a lot to do with the music's macho rebel side, rock has yet to spawn a keyboard hero with the Dionysian mystique of Jimi Hendrix or the godlike one of Eric Clapton.

And in \\"Rock in This Pocket (Song of David),\\" the opening cut of her new album, \\"99.9 F degrees,\\" she slyly addresses the problem of being a quiet folk miniaturist in a heavy-metal world by imagining herself as David to the rock world's Goliath.  \\"What's so small to you is so large to me/ If it's the last thing I do/ I'll make you see,\\" she declares in a voice that sounds demure but stubborn.    By far Vega's most rewarding record, \\"99.9 F degrees\\" (A&M 54005","excerpt":"CD and cassette) is the first album in which she breaks almost completely away from the conventions of the New York folk milieu that nurtured her.  Produced by Mitchell Froom, a studio wizard with an ear for odd noises and instrumental juxtapositions, the record is filled with intriguing Dadaist clangs, clunks and honks that silhouette her ruminations in a stylized carnival atmosphere.

In some ways, this collection might have been called \\"Raitt's Revenge\\": After establishing a new peak of popularity, Ms. Raitt, 44, has returned with the sort of soulful, brooding album that used to consign her to mere cult status.

It is followed by the title song, co-written by Ms. Raitt and her husband, the actor Michael O'Keefe. The pair -- whose first recorded collaboration, \\"One Part Be My Lover,\\" was a high point of \\"Luck of the Draw\\"-- has come up with another wry winner, the gently doleful tale of a short-order cook with a troubled marriage and a longing in his heart for a better, more romantic life.

Sometimes a musician has an exceptionally creative day. But most end up slogging through the same material in the same way as thousands of other performers, and much of the music suffers from the lack of a live audience.

It was inevitable that this status should be reflected in Ms. Streisand's new album, \\"Back to Broadway.\\" But power cuts both ways.

For his major-label debut album, \\"Wasps' Nests\\" (London","excerpt":"CD and cassette), credited to the band named the 6ths, more than a dozen luminaries of independent rock -- including Barbara Manning and Mac McCaughan of Superchunk -- agreed to sing Mr. Merritt's songs. In doing so they entered a world where bubble-gum pop is carefully pampered: turned into a doll's house of homilies. Lou Barlow, for example, of those romance-is-dead college favorites Sebadoh, forlornly sings Mr. Merritt's lyric \\"I think I'm gonna dance/Till the moon goes down,\\" to soft music reminiscent of 1960's Petula Clark.

It's a great excuse to spend a few hours in Tacitus or Gibbon or the wonderful old 11th Britannica, where the Romans of old are chronicled and evaluated with superb concision and confidence. And it's a solid, nicely varied program of music as well.   Mr. Domingo starts with Nero -- an excerpt from Mascagni's \\"Nerone\\" (1935), the ill-favored swan song of a long and frustrated theatrical career. The opera treats the final debaucheries and ignominious death of Nero, as graphically recounted in Suetonius. The excerpt is an ode to love and wine improvised at a banquet; it gives satisfying evidence that Mascagni's lyrical vein was not completely exhausted in 1935. Mr. Domingo might not be interested in playing Nero on stage, at least as Suetonius describes him (height, average; body, pustular and malodorous; features, pretty rather than handsome; neck, squat; belly, protuberant; legs, spindling). But the aria fits his voice handsomely. Roman Heroes Over the Ages From Domingo"},{"year":"1992","title":"During the mid-80's, country music took a cue from rock and revived the singer-songwriter tradition. Steve Earle and Lyle Lovett, like Hank Williams, Loretta Lynn and Willie Nelson before them, offered their own songs in their own idiosyncratic voices. They went against the grain of the Nashville system, in which smooth singers interpreted the work of professional songwriters. The notion of the modern country singer-songwriter looked like a historic return to self-expression, but also an innovation. Of course, performers like Earle and Lovett failed to overthrow the system, but their confident examples altered the direction of the town's more ambitious singers. On his latest and finest album, \\"The Chase\\" (Liberty 98743","excerpt":"CD and cassette), Garth Brooks champions the cause.\\n\\nThe album opens with Brooks adding his voice to the debate about everyday families and decency that has preoccupied the nation during this election year. \\"This ain't comin' from no prophet,\\" Brooks begins on \\"We Shall Be Free,\\" his current single, fully aware that the singer-songwriter convention can seem sanctimonious. Yet he doesn't let that stop him from declaring, in a country-gospel setting that achieves an easy gravity, his criteria for an ideal America. Written in the aftermath of last spring's riots in Los Angeles, the song expresses a longing for an end to poverty and censorship and states that racial, sexual and religious biases should fade away. This isn't a naively idealistic song; instead, it argues that, even today, there is a place for optimism. \\"Hold out,\\" Brooks urges, indicating that such impulses shouldn't be dismissed as unattainable.

Its ideas are distilled in images like \\"chile pepper in Styrofoam bottle\\" or the satellite dish in the song \\"Parabolicamara.\\" Mr. Gil's music holds all those crosscurrents, too, transforming them into ebullient vamps that tickle the ear while they invoke both local and international styles.   \\"Madalena,\\" a version of a well-known samba, opens the album with the rumba rhythms and curling guitar lines of Zairean pop; \\"I Want to Be Your Funk\\" grafts funk to smooth Brazilian pop-jazz.  But Mr. Gil, who at times has grown so fond of foreign styles that he has simply imitated them, has returned to his northeastern roots. He pays tribute to the orixas, or African deities, that are central to Bahia's candomble religion; he praises his idol, the songwriter Dorival Caymmi, as an African Buddha above the bubbly rhythm of \\"Nago Buddha,\\" trading lines with the high voice of Mr. Caymmi's daughter, Nana.

Nobody can follow all the myriad permutations in reggae fashion, not only in Jamaica but in New York and London as well. Yet broad currents are evident. Right now, reggae permeates pop more than it has since the death of Bob Marley in 1981, and interest in both classic and progressive reggae runs high. Club hits like Mad Cobra's \\"Flex\\" and crossover numbers like Snow's \\"Informer\\" arrive too frequently to be isolated phenomena anymore.    By coincidence, two acts that bend reggae's past toward its future have recently released superior albums. Shaggy's debut, \\"Pure Pleasure\\" (Virgin 87953","excerpt":"CD and cassette), has enough outsized vitality and infectious tunes to show that the reggae variant called dancehall is more than an erratic singles factory.

It presents love as a purifying ordeal and a spiritual quest, as both a state of grace and a fall from grace, in songs delivered with the austere deliberation of the blues.   Love, faith, power and terror have always been tangled in Harvey's songs, and \\"To Bring You My Love\\" just knots them tighter.

With a voice that suggests a frilly pillow lined with steel, and squeaking out adorable little \\"eeks,\\" Ms. Prince is such a compelling personality that the record comes close to realizing the goal of every Broadway cast album.

His turning of his own experience into a brainy Jerry Lewis comedy instead of an offshoot of \\"East of Eden\\" may explain why his recording career has paled commercially beside those of performers like Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Joni Mitchell. To a mass audience, searching for paradise has seemed more romantic than doing pratfalls down a highway lined with banana peels.    Since 1970, Wainwright has released 13 albums of spare, mostly first-person vignettes. Those records have accumulated into an extended pop journal unprecedented in its confessional candor. The songs recount everything from childhood and prep-school adventures to marriage, parenthood, divorce, career crises, living abroad and, in 1988, the death of his father, a noted Life magazine columnist and editor. As Wainwright has matured, his light verses have steadily grown in depth and poignancy.

As he points out in the autobiographical notes that accompany his new album, \\"Return of the Boombap,\\" much of his recent work has been denounced as pedantic and lacking in musical credibility. There's a reason for this criticism: ever since his partner in Boogie Down Productions, DJ Scott La Rock, was shot to death in 1987, KRS-One has served double-duty as a rapper and producer.

Her characters are the housewives, the car-pool drivers, the kid sisters, the drugstore counter girls and others who live out their lives on linoleum instead of on stage or in battle.   Ms. Carpenter herself is a model of modesty. The winner of a Grammy for the song \\"Down at the Twist and Shout,\\" from her 1990 album \\"Shooting Straight in the Dark,\\" she has risen through the country ranks without flash or bravado: no big hair, sequined gowns, teary performances.

The pianist James Booker, who was plagued by alcohol and drug addiction and neurosis and died in 1983 at the age of 43, seemed like a victim of this: until now, he always sounded a shade more stellar in anecdote than on records.   But those who saw him in concert claimed that he took more chances on the keyboard than other New Orleans wizards. Now the full Booker prowess can finally be heard on two complementary collections, \\"Resurrection of the Bayou Maharajah\\" (Rounder 2118","excerpt":"CD and cassette), which features vocals, and the all-instrumental \\"Spiders on the Keys\\" (Rounder 2119; CD and cassette).

Add half a cup of Methodist hymns. A dash of psychedelia is optional. Bake into a cake, cover with sweet pink icing, and leave it out in the rain.

Mr. Webb, who is 47, has had as odd a career as any songwriter of his generation.

That is, if a once-innovative but now-defunct group waits long enough to stage a reunion, the band can become more celebrated than it originally was. This is certainly a possibility for the early punk outfit Television, whose members had not played together for 13 years before recording the just-released comeback album \\"Television\\" (Capitol 98396","excerpt":"CD and cassette).    Underground-rock fans had mixed reactions when Television became headliners at the Manhattan punk club CBGB in the mid-1970's, particularly about the lead guitarist, singer and songwriter Tom Verlaine. According to punk ideology at that time, catchy tunes were to be played mostly for camp value and other songs should be nasty, brutish and short. Verlaine, who openly admired French Symbolist poets and avant-garde jazz saxophonists, would swirl through long, involuted solos that reminded his detractors of the despised psychedelic rock of hippie San Francisco.

The band's trio of vocalists -- the lyricist Paul Heaton, plus Briana Corrigan and Dave Hemingway -- cover topics ranging from drinking to old age to that rock staple, love.

Usually the line is traced in operatic terms, with Lawrence Tibbett, John Charles Thomas, Leonard Warren, Robert Merrill, Cornell MacNeil and Sherrill Milnes as key names, though we should probably not look to their successors for the emblematic American baritone of today. Successors there are, of varying capabilities, in the roles those six filled at the Metropolitan and elsewhere, but they seem less and less central to anything interesting or vital on the musical scene.   There is a new kind of American baritone, likelier to be found in the classical-music counterculture of historical instruments, new music, \\"alternative\\" opera, song recital. William Parker, William Sharp and Sanford Sylvan are examples. They are as different from one another as any of the star baritones named above, but they have in common that they never sound like, or seem to want to sound like, any of that group in full cry. They are sensitive and thoughtful, and one has the impression that they choose the music they sing because they particularly care about it -- nowhere more than in Mr. Sylvan's new record of song cycles by Chanler, Copland and Barber (\\"Beloved That Pilgrimage,\\" Nonesuch 79259-2","excerpt":"CD and cassette).

Even though the Crowes are in their 20's, unwitting listeners may feel they've stumbled on a typical FM rock station circa 1972.   The re-creation isn't limited to the music, either. Mr. Robinson, who twirls his microphone stand and struts like a rooster in the best Rod Stewart fashion, wears bell bottoms.

The relationship of Ravi Shankar and Philip Glass goes back a quarter of a century, when Mr. Glass was hired by the Indian musician to transcribe some of his sitar music into Western notation. That encounter opened Mr. Glass to new ways of thinking about rhythm, and the rest is, of course, history. Now, in a recording in which the two pay tribute to one another, Mr. Glass deconstructs Mr. Shankar's elaborate melodies in compositions he recorded with a chamber ensemble in New York, while Mr. Shankar builds intricate sound castles in works he recorded in Madras for himself, orchestra and choir. Mr. Glass and Mr. Shankar always sound themselves, but the pieces do demonstrate just what versatile, boundary-bursting musicians they are.    -- Mark Swed    Bartok: 'Contrasts'; Stravinsky: 'L'Histoire du soldat' Suite; Ives: 'Largo'; Songs (arranged for clarinet)  Richard Stoltzman, clarinet; Lucy Chapman Stoltzman, violin; Richard Goode, piano. RCA Victor Red Seal 60170-2-RC. CD and cassette.    Bartok's \\"Contrasts,\\" derived from folk dances, was initially to be titled \\"Rhapsody\\"; the final version received its Carnegie Hall premiere at the hands of Benny Goodman, Joseph Szigeti and Bartok himself. Such rich blood, high spirits and dazzling craft are the stuff wrought by the present threesome in this heady performance. If Mr. Stoltzman's agile clarinet rules \\"Contrasts,\\" it is Lucy Chapman Stoltzman's droll violin that puts the scintillating finish on Stravinsky's own arrangement of music from \\"L'Histoire du Soldat.\\" The arrangements for nine Ives songs add little, and the printed lyrics serve only as a reminder of the peculiar charm that is missing without the singing.   -- Lawrence B. Johnson  Mendelssohn: Third Symphony ('Scottish') and Fourth Symphony ('Italian')  London Classical Players conducted by Roger Norrington (EMI/Angel; CDC 7 54000; CD and cassette); Berlin Philharmonic conducted by James Levine; Deutsche Grammophon 427 670; CD only).     As Mendelssohn conductors, Roger Norrington and James Levine have little in common except that neither is noted for doing Mendelssohn. Not surprisingly, the distance between their versions is wide. Mr. Norrington emphasizes the lean, sometimes pungent or explosive timbres of his early-instrument band. The move into the middle-Romantic repertory is a recent one for them, however, and in many ways the performances sound like sketches, with expressive details to be filled in later. If not for the sonorities and an occasional trick with rhythm or tempo, in fact, a listener could mistake these for performances by a well-drilled but not terribly imaginative modern orchestra. Mr. Levine's readings are traditional in the 20th-century -- but also the best -- sense of the term. The sound is blended and mellow, the lines long and flowing, the pacing broad. Mood as well as texture counts.  -- Andrew L. Pincus Rutter: Te Deum and other church music  Cambridge Singers, City of London Sinfonia, conducted by John Rutter. Collegium Records COLCD 112; CD and cassette.      You might dismiss these amiable compositions as sacred \\"easy listening.\\" But Mr. Rutter approaches church music the way Rossini and Verdi did, using the vocabulary of contemporary secular music. His melodies and rhythms are not operatic so much as derived from Broadway, film and folk music, and are as appropriate to liturgy as the music of any age. His choral writing is fluent, idiomatic and always expressive of the text. His instrumentation is colorful, his harmony firmly diatonic with occasional hints of commercial glitz. -- Barrymore L. Scherer 'Mitropoulos Conducts Richard Strauss'  Various orchestras conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos. Hunt Productions 2 HUNTCD 581 (two-disk set) and HUNTCD 583; CD only.      Mitropoulos may be due for a rediscovery, but it is hard to imagine this assortment of eight concert performances from the 1950's igniting the flame. The sound ranges from fair to poor, and the performances -- all charged with a restless intensity -- are even more variable. The best is a heavyweight but vital \\"Burleske\\" with the pianist Rudolf Serkin and the New York Philharmonic. A \\"Symphonia domestica\\" with the Philharmonic verges on incoherence (an \\"Alpensinfonie\\" with the Vienna Philharmonic is not much better), but an alternate \\"domestica\\" with the Cologne radio orchestra stands up well. The liner notes mix the inaccurate with the incomprehensible. A once-important recording figure deserves better.-- A. L. P.  POP/JAZZ  Pylon: 'Chain'  Sky 72020-2; all three formats.     Six years afer disbanding, Pylon has returned without missing one of its hard, sharp beats. Along with the B-52's, the band briefly made Athens, Ga., the headquarters for dance-rock in the early 80's; they also showed the far more famous R.E.M. how to make a seductive sound triumph over art-student lyrics. Pylon, whose members learned to play instruments together, still works as a dynamic commune: Curtis Crowe delivers imperious drum jolts; the bassist Michael Lachowski and the guitarist Randy Bewley exchange low, buzzing lead figures, while Vanessa Briscoe Hay mixes soul growls with train-whistle yelps. On \\"Go\\" and \\"Outside\\" especially, they throw in melodies of ideal, austere sensuality. -- Milo Miles L.L. Cool J.: 'Mama Said Knock You Out'  Def Jam/Columbia 46888; all three formats.     On the rebound from a dud album, \\"Walking With a Panther,\\" L.L. Cool J. has gone back to street level. He reclaims his persona as the most articulate of homeboys, above uncluttered funk riffs assembled by the producer Marley Marl. L.L. Cool J. is back to putting down rivals and praising such simple pleasures as driving a car with a \\"boomin' system,\\" showing off his boundless gift for analogy and wordplay: \\"Milky Cereal\\" works breakfast brand-names into lascivious double-entendres. Balancing the boasts is \\"Cheesy Rat Blues,\\" a wheezy complaint by a has-been rapper whose friends disappeared with his popularity, and \\"Illegal Search,\\" about how a young black man's trappings of success draw police harassment. As L.L. Cool J. peeks behind the crass materialism his persona once took for granted, he sounds tougher and funnier.-- Jon Pareles    King's X: 'Faith Hope Love by King's X'  Megaforce/Atlantic 7 82145; all three formats.     Progressive rock, a tired relic of the post-psychedelic era, has rarely sounded as vibrant as it does on the hard-rock trio's third album. Their collision of knotty melodicism, complex vocals and epic lyrical gestures echoes the alchemical affectations of Genesis and Yes. But Ty Tabor's serrated riffing is closer to Metallica in snarl and spirit, while the band's bracing power-pop harmonies recall vintage Badfinger. With the singer-bassist Doug Pinnick wailing atop the mix with gritty, Bono-esque nobility, King's X rams its utopian message home with ferocity and finesse. -- David Fricke Sir Shina Peters: 'Ace'  CBS 1002; LP only (from Stern's Music, 598 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10012).     African pop music, clearly formulaic, occasionally allows for a bit of change. Enter Sir Shina Peters, Nigeria's newest and most exciting band leader. Mr. Peters -- \\"the creator of the Afro-juju sound,\\" according to the album's liner notes -- mixes American funk and hip-hop rhythms with the wavelike surge of talking drums. Choruses sing paeans to Mr. Peters, and Mr. Peters sings his own praises. The band, 20 or so strong, rocks; guitars burst into the mix, and song segues into song for album-length pieces in classic, intense juju style. Though it reproduces about a tenth of the wildness of Mr. Peters's live shows, the album is a good example of the endless cross-pollination between worlds.   -- Peter Watrous   Loren Schoenberg and His Jazz Orchestra: 'Just a-Settin' and a-Rockin' '  MusicMasters 5039-2-C; CD only.     The tenor saxophonist combines a scholar's fascination for the offbeat with an improviser's delight in risk-taking. All four of Mr. Schoenberg's big-band swing albums (like those of the American Jazz Orchestra, for which he also serves as orchestra manager) swingingly exalt the fundamentals of jazz repertory: Mr. Schoenberg and his sidemen ad-lib stunningly individual solos in traditional styles, with the most rewarding numbers coming from the mammoth legacies of Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman. Showcasing such superb soloists as the clarinetist Ken Peplowski, the singer Barbara Lea and the late drum giant Mel Lewis, \\"Just a-Settin' and a-Rockin' \\" serves up history you can put your foot to.   -- Will Friedwald   HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES"},{"year":"1990","title":"Here are some notable releases of the last few months.

It begins on a winter's night when a down-at-heel young wayfarer passes for the last time by the house of the burgher's daughter who has jilted him. It ends when he meets a barefoot old organ grinder, cranking out broken tunes on the ice, noticed only by growling curs.   In between, the disappointed lover scours snow-swept meadows for his beloved's footprints, trails will-o'-the-wisps into rocky ravines, staggers exhausted past a deserted graveyard, and weeps to see one last leaf, like the last of his hopes, fall from a bare tree to the ground. The wayfarer on this occasion is Miss Brigitte Fassbaender, and to get straight to the point, this is no material for a woman.   Can we discuss this like civilized people?   At the ballet, men in the prime of life dance old hags. At the opera, dowagers cavort as knights in armor. At the playhouse, a strapping black actor can portray a deformed king of England. On Broadway, with $25 million at stake, a Welshman may even play a Eurasian. Wars break out over whether such things should be allowed, encouraged, forbidden or required, but under the paper moon of theatrical illusion, they come to pass.     Outside the theater, no such moon shines. A singer alone in the spotlight has no alternate self -- no character, no role -- to hide behind, so certain lines are harder to cross. Oh, sure, a chanteuse in a cabaret can purr \\"Lili Marlene\\" to the soldiers. But in the usual course of things, men don't sing \\"Bill\\" or \\"Mary\\" or \\"My Man,\\" and women pass up \\"Maria\\" and \\"Man of La Mancha\\" and \\"Just Like a Woman.\\" No one needs to tell you why. Anyone who likes can do \\"Amazing Grace,\\" \\"You're the Top\\" and \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\\" But except for purposes of travesty, where the lyrics call for a man rather than a woman or the other way around, what the lyrics say goes. The sexes are equal but separate, and    vive la difference   .   In classical song, the picture is different, in mostly unexamined ways that turn out to be revealing. Anyone who listens to lieder recitals soon finds out that, lo and behold, women are forever singing songs that presuppose a male speaker, whereas the opposite case is practically unheard of. Yet practically the entire repertory of art songs, from Monteverdi to Berio, consists of lyrics by men set to music by men. Here as elsewhere in our culture, men presume to put words in the mouths of women, and women validate the presumption by lending men's creation their voices.    \\"Madame Bovary, c'est moi!\\" declared Flaubert, misleading readers and critics for generations. In truth, a novelist or a playwright is never one character or another character but a presence dispersed through the work at hand. The poet's \\"I,\\" where one exists, is different. To come into being, it requires an act of unconditional identification.   To be sure, the circumstances of writing and imagining are not those of performance. In the privacy of their studies, it appears, men are at liberty to identify with whomever they choose. Mozart's song \\"Als Luise die Briefe Ihres Ungetreuen Liebhabers Verbrannte\\" (\\"As Louise Burned the Letters of Her Faithless Lover\\") has, as it happens, a text by a woman, one Gabriele von Baumberg, who except for Mozart would not survive as so much as a footnote. As it is, who even thinks about who wrote the lyric? Since Ovid, men beyond number have written love letters in the fleeting guise of women. Goethe was one, and his rapturous sonnet \\"Die Liebende Schreibt\\" (\\"Written by a Woman in Love\\") served as a text for a rapturous Mendelssohn.   Adelbert von Chamisso wrote nine poems painting the intimate sentiments of a young woman as she falls in love, marries, bears a daughter, loses her husband and lives to see her daughter marry in turn and bear a daughter of her own. Carl Loewe set the entire cycle but omitted the two last songs (the husband's death and the dreamy address to the granddaughter) from the first edition of his \\"Frauenliebe\\" (\\"A Woman's Love\\").   Schumann's better-known cycle, composed four years after Loewe's, never did include Chamisso's last poem. It breaks off with the young wife's bereavement, while retaining Chamisso's more encompassing title, \\"Frauenliebe und -leben\\" (\\"A Woman's Love and Life\\"). Apparently Schumann felt that with the husband's death, the wife's life, too, is a closed book. Loewe, like Chamisso, must have known better. Still, he seems to have judged that his bourgeois audience preferred not to look beyond the sentimental fulfillment of young motherhood.   At any rate, however astutely or partially Mozart, Goethe, Mendelssohn, Chamisso, Schumann and Loewe have penetrated the feminine psyche, no man would dream of presenting their insights in public, any more than they would impersonate the coy nymph of Debussy's Arcadian \\"Chansons de Bilitis.\\"   In public, we seem to require that a man be a man. But on the concert stage, there is no corresponding requirement for a woman to be a woman. Schubert's merry son of the muses (in \\"Der Musensohn\\") and his rhapsodic youth Ganymede (in \\"Ganymed\\") are constantly being brought to life by female interpreters, as is Wolf's amorous gardener (\\"Der Gartner\\").   No one misunderstands when a pretty lady in a frilly dress steps out in front of an orchestra to raise her voice in a love lyric plainly addressed to a woman, as in \\"Villanelle,\\" the opening song of Berlioz's cycle \\"Les Nuits d'Ete.\\" With so many instrumental voices contributing to the poetic statement, the singer is in any case less a person than the vessel of some emblematic or universal truth. And thus sopranos and mezzo-sopranos are forever intoning the emotions of the heartsick swain of Mahler's \\"Lieder Eines Fahrenden Gesellen\\" or the grieving father of his \\"Kindertotenlieder,\\" and no one complains of incongruity; the arrow is pointing in the approved direction.    In certain songs implying a male speaker, a woman's voice is even preferred, and text be damned. Mahler's \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\" concludes with a half-hour nocturne called \\"Der Abschied\\" (\\"The Farewell\\"), in which a man waits at nightfall to say a last goodbye to a friend -- another man -- who is leaving to await death in the loneliness of the mountains. The friend arrives. The friends part. The words and music are drenched in romantic yearning. \\"I long to be at your side to relish the beauty of the evening,\\" cries the friend as he waits. \\"Where are you? How long you leave me by myself!\\"   What might it mean to an audience to hear this outburst from a baritone rather than an alto? Mahler's score allows either, but in the concert hall the male option is rarely exercised. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, though, recorded the work twice -- none too successfully, to tell the truth, since critical passages lie below and above his most effective range. But apart from that, he shies back, though less than we must suppose most men would, from the pathos, the violence of sentiment.   For the concert stage, a man dons his uniform -- \\"concert dress\\" -- and voices feelings that are seemly for a man to express. Given the anxieties in our culture, that excludes a great many. Sincerity, authenticity -- these are the virtues we judge him by. Mutability, moodiness, frank caprice: these are vice in him.   In general, he is not allowed the freedom to sing \\"in quotes.\\" He must sing as himself; he must make the words his own. A woman may do the same, if she likes. But she also has leeway to strike poses and assume disguises. She may charm, she may tease. And she may choose, as a man may not, not to sing as a person at all, but rather as a mouthpiece, a pure instrument, as the disembodied voice of the poem, even the voice of poetry, the muse.   Must this be so? No. It is mere convention. But one ignores convention at one's peril. Take the young baritone Thomas Hampson. For his first recorded lieder recital (Teldec), he has assembled an imaginative program of songs by various hands to the seminal collection of German folk lyrics \\"Des Knaben Wunderhorn.\\" What invites comment in this context is his inclusion of two songs that require a female interpreter: \\"Liebesklage des Madchens\\" (\\"The Maiden's Love Lament\\"), by Brahms; and \\"Das Bucklichte Mannlein\\" (\\"The Little Hunchback\\"), by Zemlinsky.   The more Mr. Hampson exercises his wiles on these items, the more they resist. The singer comes off at once professorial and foolish, his great gifts and admirable ambitions locked in a stranglehold with affectation.    Mr. Fischer-Dieskau, with whom Mr. Hampson has been compared, was not one to commit such errors of judgment. His vast 25-LP survey of Schubert songs left out whatever he felt unsuitable for a man (\\"Gretchen am Spinnrade,\\" for instance, or \\"Die Junge Nonne\\"); and when he undertook to record the complete songs of Brahms, he ceded the women's songs, among them \\"Liebesklage des Madchens,\\" to Jessye Norman.   So what, in principle, is the objection to a woman in \\"Winterreise\\"? It is not as if Miss Fassbaender were breaking new ground. Elena Gerhardt and Lotte Lehmann preceded her decades ago. In the last few years, Christa Ludwig has performed it live and on an exceptionally cultured, rather matronly recording (Deutsche Grammophon) that met with lavish praise in certain quarters. Other women have been tempted, too, including Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. When she demanded to know why she should not attempt it, the story goes, she was told, \\"Because, Elisabeth, you are not a man.\\"   She listened. But why? There is, in fact, no reason in principle. The reasons lie not in principles but in the particular character of this work. \\"Winterreise\\" -- like Schubert's preceding song cycle, \\"Die Schone Mullerin\\" and the cyclelike group of Heine songs in his posthumous collection \\"Schwanengesang\\" -- is too close to the bone, too irreducibly confessional to permit any hint of artifice. The presence of a woman in place of a man is patent artifice -- an artifice the conventions of the concert stage generally do not oppose. But in these songs, not a phrase may be placed in quotes. They must be real.    Miss Fassbaender, to give her credit, makes them as real as she can. Along with her accompanist, the composer Aribert Reimann, she has imagined her way deep into the dark heart of Wilhelm Muller's texts and Schubert's settings. The performance displays a brave ferocity that many male duos would do well to emulate. The price, it must be said, is steep. Mr. Reimann's pianism is often brutal, and the list of Miss Fassbaender's vocal blemishes is long: savage timbres, wild wobbles, sobs fetched -- heaved -- from the chest.   But no one could accuse Miss Fassbaender of prettifying the cycle's relentless despair. In the opening song, \\"Gute Nacht\\" (\\"Good Night\\"), she makes a persuasive case for an optional drop of an octave that most men avoid. The dyspeptic note she strikes in \\"Irrlicht\\" (\\"Will-o'-the-Wisp\\") is distinctive. She goes at \\"Der Greise Kopf\\" (\\"The Grizzled Head\\") in accents that are grand and tragic. And the exceptionally febrile reading makes more cogent sense of the fey little waltz \\"Tauschung\\" (\\"Illusion\\") than any other that comes to mind. Miss Fassbaender needs no instruction in the hues of gloom.   Still, nothing works. Where we seek to be lost in raw experience, she offers a performance. It is not a failure of imagination; it is the nature of the instrument. In full cry, Miss Fassbaender evokes the adolescent hysterics of Octavian toward the end of \\"Der Rosenkavalier's\\" first act. The emotion is not wrong. But Octavian is a boy -- a boy still smooth-cheeked enough to masquerade as a girl. The wanderer of \\"Winterreise\\" has crossed that threshold. His voice has changed. Young, perhaps 20, as we must imagine him, he may sooner be brought to life in a man of 60 than in a woman who can pass for a lad of 17.   \\"Winterreise\\" is that exception in the literature: a group of songs that belong uniquely to men. Whether or not it is Miss Fassbaender's intention, her performance takes up arms against every convention that says so. And for such an act of daring, we should be grateful; it points the way to a possible future -- a true future, a future that differs from the past and is not just a Xerox copy.   Unlike a failed \\"Winterreise\\" by some ill-equipped tenor or baritone, hers tells us something. It tells us that for now and maybe for good, no matter how far we travel on the road to equality between the sexes, there are some journeys we cannot take for each other. To express what she has found in \\"Winterreise,\\" Miss Fassbaender will need to find some other vehicle, something new. We cannot lean on the classics for everything.  This old world is younger than we think.

Video and film become grainy and jerky when transferred to computer disks. Photographs, maps and even text lose their crispness on the low-resolution screens of personal computers. Art and animation expressly designed for those screens works better, but must labor under severe limitations.         The winner? Radio. The CD format, after all, was originally designed to deliver music, and although the sound cards and speakers most people use preclude truly high-fidelity audio, they can deliver radio-quality sound. And as its partisans constantly repeated in the early days of television, radio makes listeners exercise their imagination. Some canny multimedia producers have begun to figure this out.

Its latest find is the fairly unknown but greatly gifted English composer Benedict Mason, who writes music of deep complexity and high wit. He is a mysterious figure, now 40, who seems to have turned to composition full time only in the last six or seven years. He studied with Gyorgy Ligeti and plainly echoes that composer's current blend of textural intricacy and stylistic playfulness.

In fact, his output for one piano, four hands, may be the most bewilderingly varied body of music in a single genre by any major composer. And yet this repertory -- rarely heard in concert, rarely recorded -- is well known only to those who perform it at home.   The four-movement, 45-minute Grand Duo (D. 812) is a case in point. Composed in 1824, two years after the \\"Unfinished\\" Symphony, it might have become one of Schubert's most popular and \\"characteristic\\" works had it been conceived for orchestra.

It was the rare case of a question-mark-riddled cast that uniformly performed beyond expectation. The Vienna Philharmonic played and the Vienna State Opera Chorus sang with the vitality and intuitive understanding that made them obvious first choices for this music.

As gorgeously as Emma Kirkby sang Dido for Mr. Parrott, Ms. Hunt captures the Carthaginian queen's anger and resignation far more vividly. Her voice has the right coloration for the role. Slightly dusky and nicely rounded, it sounds regal but not stolid.

DeMille Unveils His Picturesque Portrait of Lafitte, 'The Buccaneer,' Portrayed by Fredric March, at the Paramount SCREEN NOTES"},{"year":"1920","title":"\\"The Bottom of the World\\" is the title given to the motion-picture record of Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic expedition and the first half of it is at the Rivoli this week. It is the real feature of the program, by virtue of its ability to entertain and, thank Hugo Riesenfeld or whoever is responsible, by the emphasis placed upon it in advertisements of the bill. Instead of jogging along in the well-worn rut and ranking it merely as a filler because it lacked the conventional hero-heroine-villain device, Dr. Riesenfeld apparently realized that he had something genuinely dramatic and interesting in his possession and ventured to announce it as his chief attraction of the week.The only fault to find in this connection is that Dr. Riesenfeld did not go far enough. Instead of showing only half of the film, in conjunction with the usual photoplay, why didn't he dispense with the photoplay entirely and give the complete Shackleton story? As it is, spectators are only getting into the story when it breaks off. They are just beginning to feel the reality and strength of it when it stops. It's not the kind of story that should be broken up. It has no crisis at which action may be suspended while each spectator holds his breath for the next chapter. It gains dramatic momentum as it moves along and to stop it at any point before the end is to waste the force it has gathered. This might not be true if it were inordinately long, but, judging by the exasperatingly brief bit shown at the Rivoli this week, the entire film would not have taken as much time as the average photoplay uses up. With the increased and increasing number of motion picture theatres on Broadway, is it too much to hope that some manager, free to do so, will vary the regular run of so-called, but often miscalled, dramatic pictures by devoting the better part of his program to such a work as \\"The Bottom of the World\\" whenever he can get it? But in the meantime, there is reason to be grateful to Dr. Riesenfeld for as much as he has done at the Rivoli this week.The picture is a photographic record of the explorer's trip. First there are interesting scenes on board Shackleton's ship, the Endurance, which are followed shortly by the first glimpses of icebergs. There are some excellent pictures of seals, and a number of views of sea and ice expanse are of majestic beauty. Perhaps the most fascinating part of the film is that showing the Endurance breaking her way through a field of ice and finally brought to a standstill in it. There are other scenes of the activities of the explorers—and then some one comes out and plays a violin or sings or does something, and it's time for the next picture.The photoplay at the Rivoli is an adaptation of Henry Payson Dowst's story, \\"The Dancin' Fool,\\" directed by Sam Wood, with Wallace Reid in the leading role, supported by a first-class cast, including Bebe Daniels, Raymond Hatton, Willis Marks, Tully Marshall and others. The story cannot be anything but a farce, and, one imagines, it could be a very entertaining farce with adequate speed and fewer feet of film. It's about a bright boy from the country who puts jazz into his old-fashioned uncle's business and dances a la jazz in a restaurant at night. In the end, of course, he makes the business a whirling success and marries his dancing partner. Director Wood had material here suited to Reid's aptitude for foolishness, but he let the story take itself seriously in places and drag along under the impression that it was becoming a romance or something related to life. The result is that \\"The Dancin' Fool\\" is interesting only in spots.The Rivoli program is enlivened by a gay Harold Lloyd farce, entitled \\"An Eastern Westerner,\\" which is also at the Strand and Rialto.The photoplay at the Strand is \\"Riders of the Dawn,\\" derived from Zane Grey's novel, \\"The Desert of Wheat.\\" Many of the old stock situations of melodrama have been galvanized by a current of popular ideas of a modern industrial Wild West to make this rampant thriller. The chief villains are a crooked lawyer and a company of hoboes, who, presumably, represent the I. W. W., and the hero is an upstanding young fellow just returned from the war who takes off his uniform to straighten things out at home. The story might be called \\"Action Unlimited,\\" and many, undoubtedly, will be thrilled by it, but an Easterner imagines that it will seem much like a comedy to many real Westerners of the wheat-growing regions. Those who keep the action at top speed are Roy Stewart. Claire Adams, Robert McKim, Frederick Star, Violet Shram and Frank Brownlee, all of whom give good characterizations in their stereotyped parts. And most of the pictures are exceptionally well made.At the Capitol this week is a crook melodrama of little distinction entitled \\"The Deep Purple.\\" It is based on a play by Paul Armstrong and Wilson Mizner, and was directed by R. A. Walsh. The principal members of the cast are Miriam Cooper, Helen Ware, Vincent Serrano. W. J. Ferguson Stuart Sage and William B. Mack, who act well except when they overact, which is not infrequently.\\"The False Road,\\" with Enid Bennet, is at the Rialto this week","excerpt":"Cecil B.

There were occasional dry patches in her sustained singing and some tightness in the top notes, no doubt remnants of the cold that forced her to delay the recital from Sunday.         But sheer vocal beauty has never been the distinguishing quality of this beloved mezzo-soprano's work. Hers is an art of expressivity, nuance and rhythmic incisiveness that goes beyond generic prettiness of tone. All those qualities were in abundance for this outing with her frequent partner, the superb pianist Andras Schiff.    MUSIC REVIEW","excerpt":"Cecilia Bartoli and the Art of the Nuance"},{"year":"1994","title":"If God is in the details, Cecilia Bartoli must be a very devout mezzo-soprano. At her extraordinary recital at Alice Tully Hall on Monday night, Ms. Bartoli, who made her debut here in 1990 at the age of 24, put plenty of wonderful effects on display: elaborate roulades, pinpoint coloratura, smooth, effortless legato. But even in the smallest details her presence and virtuosity were powerfully felt, in the ways vowels were shaped or colored, in the ways character and meaning were created using rubato and phrasing, and, most importantly, in the sound of her breath.   This is something so subtle that it can be missed on Ms. Bartoli's many recordings, which have built her reputation for charm and mastery, particularly in performances of Mozart and Rossini. It is also just one element of her charismatic appeal, as the palpable excitement before Monday night's concert attested. Outside, a line of aspiring ticket buyers stretched futilely up Broadway. Inside, the capacity audience welcomed the singer with more enthusiasm than most artists receive after a recital.

She sang him some Rossini (a little Cenerentola), some Mozart (a little Cherubino). Maybe he was taken by her voluptuous, dark-amber timbre, accurate intonation and instinctive sense of drama, which makes the words she sings sound both natural and important. At any rate, he offered her Bach's B-minor Mass.\\n\\n\\"I knew nothing about Bach,\\" said the vivacious Miss Bartoli recently. \\"For a year and a half, I went to Salzburg every three or four months to study with Maestro Karajan, but before the concerts, he died.

The soloist was Cecilia Bartoli, the 27-year-old Italian mezzo-soprano who in the last few years has become the opera world's darling, and not without reason. Her performances in New York have been uncommonly musical, and she has the stage presence to make arias and songs the self-contained dramas they ought to be. What's more, Mostly Mozart can claim her as a trophy, having presented her American debut in 1990.    Miss Bartoli's contributions to the program were Mozart's \\"Exsultate, jubilate,\\" \\"Lungi le cure ingrate\\" from \\"Davidde Penitente,\\" and \\"Parto, parto,\\" from \\"La Clemenza di Tito.\\" She added a couple of fiery Rossini arias as encores: \\"Tanti affetti\\" from \\"La Donna del Lago,\\" and \\"Una voce poco fa\\" from \\"Il Barbiere di Siviglia.\\" Review/Music","excerpt":"Cecilia Bartoli Sings A Survey of Mozart, And a Pinch of Rossini"},{"year":"2001","title":"Anne Midgette reviews Daniel Barenboim conducting New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall","excerpt":"Cecilia Bartoli sings; photos (M) So Little Time for Poetry During a Roller Coaster Ride"},{"year":"1991","title":"When the Italian mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli made her New York debut last summer at the Mostly Mozart Festival, she struck gold in the florid music of Rossini. That also proved to be true of her second recital, which drew a large and warmly appreciative audience to Alice Tully Hall on Wednesday evening. Why not? Her singing was not always as unstrained and richly colored as a bel canto purist might ask, but when the program played to her greatest strengths in the all-Rossini second half, the recital was a knockout.   Although in her early 20's, Miss Bartoli is already identifiable as one of the scarcest creatures in any operatic era, the genuine coloratura mezzo-soprano. Rossini, who wrote often and brilliantly for this voice type, apparently found its combination of dusk and brilliance irresistible. So might anyone who heard the finale of his \\"Cenerentola\\" delivered with Miss Bartoli's fluency, pinpoint accuracy and care for expressive contrasts. The opera-concluding aria, \\"Non piu mesta,\\" is a touchstone of the coloratura-mezzo repertory and a fair measure of musical sensitivity as well as purely vocal talent. Miss Bartoli passed both tests.

That is Harold Rosenthal, the esteemed editor of Opera magazine, summing up Carlo Bergonzi in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. At first look, that statement might seem debatable if not actually inflammable, but after thinking it over for awhile I find it easy to agree. In all the flurry over the current crop of tenors - Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras - it is possible that the older generation's accomplishments might be overlooked or undervalued. It is worth trumpeting, therefore, that Mr. Bergonzi and a houseful of his admirers will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the tenor's Metropolitan Opera debut on Friday evening, when the Met will present a gala concert in his honor.

It is provocative because it suggests that, in just about every department of design, the world has been going downhill since the middle of the 16th century. Its title might suggest that it is an affair for specialists. The prints, drawings and books in question have almost no color - one or two German fashion designs alone contradict this - and they call for close and careful looking of a kind that leaves the conscientious visitor dazed and exhausted. (There are close to 200 of them, by the way.)   But it's worth it. There are some terrific things in this show.  This was a period in which you couldn't line a plain old box with scraps of wallpaper and not come up with a thing of beauty. An alphabet became a thing of magic, and a washbasin a thing of awe. The title page of a new book stood on hallowed ground, midway between graphic art and architecture. Every fireplace was a triumphal arch, and every doorknob a test piece by which the designer would be judged by his peers.

Indeed, medieval re-enactments, choristers chanting plainsong and Renaissance carols have become important parts of any designer Christmas.    The appearance of the Ensemble Project Ars Nova at the Frick Collection on Sunday -- an altogether chaster and more subdued event -- gave the listener at least one reason why.

Ruth Rogers (left) and Rose Gray are as straightforward as the seasonal Italian cuisine at their groundbreaking London restaurant, the River Café. When they say they like something, they mean it.     2. Both are big fans of St. John, the carnivore king Fergus Henderson's restaurant near Smithfield Meat Market. ''Fergus is completely true to his vision,'' says Gray. ''He makes classic English recipes that no one else in London is doing. Reading his menu is like reading a poem. The roast bone marrow on a piece of toast is perfection.''     3. As for the rest of London's culinary landscape, it's fair to say a river runs through it. Many of the town's best kitchens are populated by Café alumni: Jamie Oliver, from Fifteen","excerpt":"Celia Harvey, of Cecconi's; and Samantha and Samuel Clark, of Moro. The Clarks' new cookbook, ''Casa Moro'' (out this month in Britain from Ebury Press), elicits raves from their former bosses.  ''We love this book,'' Gray says. ''It's a very clever interpretation of Spanish, North African and Lebanese cuisine.'' Rogers and Gray's most recent book, ''Italian Easy'' (Clarkson Potter, $35), contains recipes so pared down that they practically make themselves.     4. The ladies follow the less-is-more edict when it comes to kitchen equipment. This Brustolina grill from Cerutti fits over a gas burner on a range. ''It's a nice, modest piece of equipment, ideal for grilling bruschetta or polenta,'' Gray says. ''You can find them at every street market in Italy.'' (About $6 at www.gardastore.com.)     5. Another favorite tool is a granite mortar and stainless-steel pestle,   $270, from John Julian Design. ''It's brilliant for crushing garlic, basil and pine nuts for pesto,'' says Rogers, ''and the perfect size for making salmorigilio, a mixture of crushed herbs, salt, olive oil and lemon juice.'' (At Dean & Deluca New York; 800-999-0306. Also available in London at Divertimenti, 139/141 Fulham Road; go to www.divertimenti.co.uk.)     6. The chefs travel around Italy each year to select the olive oils that will be used at the restaurant and bottled under its label (£15 to £50 a bottle at the River Café, Thames Wharf, Rainville Road).     7. These salted Ortiz anchovies from Spain are indispensable ingredients in the River Café larder. ''We love to put them with a lovely, fresh ball of mozzarella,'' Gray says. ''We also use them in the pan when we sauté scallops, and for an anchovy-and-rosemary sauce we pair with grilled wild salmon or turbot.'' For their own pantries, the chefs head to Marylebone to the Ginger Pig butcher shop for bistecca alla Fiorentina and to La Fromagerie for robiola mista tre lattti with wet walnuts.     8. Rogers and Gray love to soak up the swanky cocktail culture at Claridge's Bar, which has inspired some listings on their own bar menu. To make the River Café's current house apéritif -- a fresh-pear martini -- roughly chop the flesh and skin of 1 large ripe pear and put into a cocktail shaker. Add 2 tablespoons sugar syrup and shake vigorously to break the pear into pieces. Add 6 3/4 ounces gin, juice from 2 lemons, 3 1/2 ounces lemon grappa and crushed ice. (A good substitute for the lemon grappa is Nonino Gioiello Citrus Tree Honey grappa; $89. At Vino Italian Wine and Spirits; 212-725-6516.) Shake, strain into 4 martini glasses and serve with slivers of lemon peel.
