According to the California Tahoe Conservancy, that's the estimated crowd at Lake Tahoe on a busy summer weekend. That's enough people to make you rethink your vacation plans, but Tahoe never feels too frantic. Maybe it's the enormous mountain lake standing center, proudly straddling California and Nevada, that lets you know right away who's in charge, but the weekenders who flood the 72 miles of shoreline instinctively bow to nature's pace. And there's that other little fact, too -- far less provable, but widely asserted: There's nothing quite like a weekend spent circling Tahoe. The endless activities of summer are standard enough, but they're set to a Sierra backdrop of soaring evergreens and crystalline water worthy of a thousand poets. Throw in the late-night siren call of the Nevada casinos, and it's a tough act to follow.   CINDY PRICE    Friday    3 p.m.  1 -- Deeper Shades of Blue    ''It's just like the Caribbean!'' the tour guide, Kevin Hickey, is shouting over his paddle. ''Until you dip your hand in.'' Wordsmiths have beat themselves silly trying to capture the true color of Lake Tahoe, so take your pick -- cobalt, azure, electric, sapphire. Suffice it to say that it's pretty darn blue. And cold. Even in late summer, the water averages 65 to 70 degrees, given the many mountain streams that slither into it. Judge for yourself on a guided kayak trip out of Sand Harbor, Nev., above, with the Tahoe Adventure Company (866-830-6125, www.tahoeadventurecompany.com), which offers individual tours that are part geology lesson and part history lesson. Paddle out past the children cannonballing off the rocks, and learn about the lake's underlying fault lines, or that a tsunami may have burst forth there in the last 10,000 years.    7 p.m.  2 -- A Beautiful Language    Shake yourself dry, slip on your flip-flops, then head up the beach to the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival, above (Sand Harbor State Park, Nev.","excerpt":"800-747-4697; www.laketahoeshakespeare.com). Patrons pile up on the inclined sand banks, carrying towels, wine and fat dinner spreads. You can bring your own, or check out the offerings at the food court and beer garden. This year's rotating performances of ''Twelfth Night'' and ''Othello'' are staged at dusk, the lake deftly employed as a silent witness to the unfolding action. If you miss these two shows, which end on Sunday, you don't have to miss the beautiful park. Check the Web site for a list of events through Aug. 28.    Saturday    10 a.m.  3 -- Frank's Joint    Think of it as the Chelsea Hotel of Tahoe. Frank Sinatra owned what is now the Cal Neva Resort, Spa and Casino (2 Stateline Road, Crystal Bay, Nev.; 800-225-6382; www.calnevaresort.com) for three short years (from 1960 to 1963), but he left a wealth of scandal in his wake. The resort, called the Cal-Neva Lodge when Sinatra owned it, rests on the state line, and the property is marked down the center, above. Poke your head into the dusty old Celebrity Showroom, where Frank and his buddies performed. Marilyn Monroe often sat up front, and current members of the hotel staff say she overdosed on sleeping pills here two weeks before her death, amid a swirl of rumors of sex and foul play. Find the Indian Room yet? Secret passages run below it that lead to the closets of Cabin 3 (Marilyn's) and Cabin 5 (Frank's). The Chicago mobster Sam Giancana is said to have used the tunnels to conduct business.    12 p.m.  4 -- High Noon    It's noon on the lake, and you're 6,225 feet above sea level. A cheeseburger washed down with an ice-cold Anchor Steam ($4.50) is not only agreeable; it's mandatory. Find your way through Tahoe City and take a right just past Fanny Bridge (called ''rump row'' for the line of backsides that form as people lean over the railing to stare at the Truckee River and its fish), above. Bridgetender Tavern and Grill (65 West Lake Boulevard, Tahoe City, Calif.; 530-583-3342) is home to one of the juiciest cheeseburgers ($6.95) on the lake as well as a generous outdoor patio that winds along the Truckee.    2 p.m.  5 -- Just Drift Away    Follow the hoots of laughter across Fanny Bridge and plunk down $32 at the Truckee River Raft Company (185 River Road, Tahoe City, Calif.; 530-584-0123; www.truckeeriverraft.com) for a lazy afternoon on the river. You can paddle, but the three-hour ride is best enjoyed as one long floating party. Families drift alongside groups of friends, their tubes lashed together as they bask and pass each other beer. A little more than halfway, you might find a shallow, standing-room-only party complete with makeshift stickball games (the paddles double as bats). The ride is probably about 30 minutes too long, but it's worth it to see the occasional floater, untethered from his group and tipsy, angling for a hitch to the finish line.    7 p.m.  6 -- Cocktail of the Brave    South Lake Tahoe isn't known as a gastronomic hotbed, but a seat at the sushi bar at the Naked Fish (3940 Lake Tahoe Boulevard, South Lake Tahoe, Calif.; 530-541-3474) offers up ace rolls and a frisky pre-casino crowd. Kick your night off with an appetizer of barbecued albacore ($10.25) and the surprisingly tasty house drink, the Money Shot, which involves a bolt of hot sake, a drizzle of ponzu sauce, fish eggs, a Japanese mountain potato and a few other nerve-racking ingredients.    10 p.m.  7 -- Poker Faces, Old and New    Itching for the dull tumble of dice on felt, or the shudder and snap of a fresh deck of cards being shuffled? Here's the casino breakdown. South Tahoe's casinos, snugged up against each other along the border of Stateline, Nev., are getting sexier. Witness the vampy new MontBleu Resort Casino & Spa (55 Highway 50, 775-588-3515; www.montbleuresort.com), a k a the old Caesar's sporting a slap of paint and a fresh attitude, or the swank new 19 Kitchen/Bar at Harveys Resort Casino (18 Highway 50, 775-588-2411; www.harrahs.com). Still, old-timers and hipsters might enjoy the old-school ambience and low-limit tables at the Lakeside Inn and Casino (168 Highway 50, 800-624-7980; www.lakesideinn.com), or hang-loose Bill's Lake Tahoe Casino (27 Highway 50, 775-588-2411; www.harrahs.com), where an enormous hot dog and a draft will set you back only $2.50.    Sunday    10 a.m.  8 -- Now That's Venti    There's a 28-buck cup of coffee in Tahoe, and it's worth every penny. The first $24 gets you a ride on the touristy-but-must-do Heavenly Gondola (Heavenly Mountain Resort, 4080 Lake Tahoe Boulevard, South Lake Tahoe, Calif.; 775-586-7000; www.skiheavenly.com), a modern ski lift that doubles as a sightseeing excursion in summer. Hop on board when it opens, and cruise 2.4 miles up the mountain to the observation deck. Grab a very decent mocha ($3.75) at CafÃ© Blue, and soak in the stunning views of the Carson Valley and the Desolation Wilderness -- not to mention that big blue thing in the center.    Noon  9 -- Pesto Bread, Just Like Mom's    There's an art to gathering beach provisions, and Tahoe regulars know that the best one-stop shop around is the PDQ Market (6890 West Lake Boulevard, Tahoma, Calif.; 530-525-7411), where customers can secure not only the usual Coke and sun block, but also one of the tastiest sandwiches in town. Press through the store, and you'll find a little homegrown operation pushing out delicious sandwiches on fresh-baked breads like jalapeÃ±o or pesto. The half-size sandwich, loaded high with shaved meats like pastrami or turkey, is a steal at $3.75.    2 p.m.  10 -- Decisions, Decisions    Trying to pick the right Tahoe beach is a bit like plucking a date off the Internet. Zephyr Cove is young and likes to party. Meeks Bay is into poetry and likes long walks on the beach. The good news is that each is better looking than the next. For those given to fits of polarity, try D. L. Bliss State Park (Highway 89, South Lake Tahoe, Calif.; 530-525-7277; www.parks.ca.gov; $6 a car), a camping ground with sheltered coves for swimming and lazing, as well as a few bracing hikes for the restless. The pristine beaches make it darn hard to resist the former, though. Imagine you've found the turquoise waters of Vieques in the middle of the Black Forest of Germany. Until you dip your hand in, of course.    THE BASICS  Blue and Green       Reno Tahoe International Airport is about 60 miles northeast of Lake Tahoe, and Sacramento International Airport is about 100 miles west.      Following this itinerary, you'll want to stay north the first night. Mourelatos Lakeshore Resort in Tahoe Vista, Calif. (6834 North Lake Boulevard, 800-824-6381; www.mlrtahoe.com), is a cute, family-owned hotel on the lake, with a private beach. Rates from $215 a night.     A great budget option in the south is the quaint Avalon Lodge in South Lake Tahoe, Calif. (4075 Manzanita Avenue, 800-659-4185; www.avalonlodge.com). You can walk to the casinos, and the staff is very friendly -- be nice, and they might be kind enough to share their directions to their favorite hidden beach.

The pass will work like Eurailpass, which allows discount travel in 17 countries, including Austria and Hungary.   FrenchRail, the agent for the new pass in North America, will offer two passes valid in first class: one for $160 a person that allows five days of travel within a 15-day period and the other for $259 a person that allows 10 days of travel within a month.

Austrian officials hope that vacationers will use Vienna as a gateway to Eastern Europe.    The European East Pass, which is expected to be available through travel agents in December, will offer substantial savings to the traveler making several journeys, rail officials say, particularly if some trips are taken in Austria, where train tickets cost much more than in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland.

Subway Section Opens in Rome    ROME -- A new six-mile section of Rome's slowly expanding subway system opened this month. An extension of Line B, it links the northeastern outskirts with the central railroad terminal (Stazione Termini), the hub of the Metropolitana subway network. The old section of Line B, opened in 1955, runs from the rail terminal to the Colosseum, the modern World's Fair quarter and the Cecchignola military barracks, with a branch from the Ostiense stop to the seaside at Ostia, 13 miles from the center. The 10-year-old Line A runs from the southeastern outskirts near the Alban Hills to the rail terminal and to Via Ottaviano, a 10-minute walk from St. Peter's Square. A westward extension is planned.   The new Line B section provides a link between the Tiburtina railroad station in the northeast and the central railroad terminal. It is welcomed by many rail passengers because some long-distance trains between northern and southern Italy, including Sicily,stop only at Tiburtina, where it is often hard to get a cab, but not at Stazione Termini. A ride on the Roman subways still costs 61 cents, but the fare will soon go up.   A major reason subway construction in Rome is being competed gingerly is the city's buried past. Wherever digging starts, fragments of ancient statuary, remains of pagan temples and other finds come to light, and contractors have to suspend work until the archeologists are satisfied. -- PAUL HOFMANN Eastern Starts Flights to Ponce    Daily nonstop flights between Newark and Ponce, P.R., are to be introduced by Eastern Airlines on Thursday, giving travelers a second major gateway to Puerto Rico and the opportunity to bypass the San Juan airport. The service to Ponce, the port city on the Caribbean on the island's southern coast, is the first from the mainland. The airport has been expanded to accommodate wide-bodied aircraft such as the Boeing 757 that Eastern will use on the route. The flights are scheduled to leave Newark daily at 7:15 A.M., arriving in Ponce at 11:45 A.M. Return flights leave Ponce at 12:50 P.M. and arrive in Newark at 3:40 P.M. Eastern said fares would be from $248 round trip in coach. O'Hare Data On 900 Number    FlightCall, an information system on a 900 telephone number, gives status reports for all 2,200 daily flights arriving and departing O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. Official Airline Guides, the travel information company that started the O'Hare service last month, says it plans similar phone lines at 13 other major airports in the next few months.   Travelers can call 900-786-8686 at 75 cents a minute, and they are promised access to the line after the first ring. The caller also gets gate and baggage carousel information and news of delays. The company says the information comes from the airlines' data displays in the airport and is revised every 10 minutes.    Official Airline Guides says it hopes to include the next available departure for travelers whose flights have been delayed or canceled. Similar services are to be set up for Kennedy and La Guardia Airports by Thanksgiving. Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Denver, Boston, Miami, Orlando, San Francisco, Los Angeles National and Dulles will get the service afterward. Fourth Airport For Queensland    A plan to upgrade the Proserpine Airport in Queensland will offer travelers a fourth international airport when visiting the northeastern Australian state, which includes the Great Barrier Reef.   The project, being developed by Ansett Airlines and Aqua Del Ray International (a Japanese development company), calls for the existing air strip to be extended by about 650 feet and the runway shoulders widened to meet international standards and accommodate long-range aircraft. Construction of the $5 million first phase, which has yet to receive the necessary governmental approvals, is expected to be completed by 1993.    The upgraded airport, which will be renamed Whitsunday International Airport, will ease the burden on Queensland's three existing international airports at Brisbane, Cairns and Townsville.    Future plans call for construction of a new international arrivals terminal and possibly extending the runway another 3,000 feet to handle longer-range 747 aircraft. Vietnamese Art In Hong Kong    Hong Kong harbors large populations of Vietnamese boat people, some 55,000 -- a population that is, by most accounts, ignored by most Hong Kong residents. One step toward creating awareness is an show of art by the boat people, on display through Nov. 8 at the Hong Kong Arts Center, Harbour Road, Wan Chai.   \\"Still Lives,\\" an exhibit of 70 paintings and drawings by 18 Vietnamese, explores the trials and slim joys of daily life in Hong Kong's detention camps, where boat people await word whether they will be given asylum or be forcibly returned to Vietnam. The show came together thanks largely to the efforts of Veronique Saunier, a French public relations consultant who spends time as a volunteer working in the refugee camps.   The result is a hauntingly eloquent vision of life in the camps. A scene of people lining up for their daily rations was painted by a law student, Tran Van Hung. The scene used for the exhibition's poster was painted by Hoang Quoc Bien. In it, a young boy stands on an upended garbage can, straining to talk to a girl on the other side of a barbed wire fence -- the Statue of Liberty watches over the lovers' meeting. A WHALE HABITAT IN BALTIMORE    The National Aquarium in Baltimore is scheduled to open its $35 million Marine Mammal Pavilion on Dec. 26. The main feature of the 94,000-square-foot addition is a habitat for three beluga whales and six Atlantic bottlenose dolphins surrounded by a 1,300-seat amphitheater. A 30-minute presentation about whales will be given in the amphitheater several times a day. The 1.2-million-gallon pool has large acrylic windows that provide views of the creatures underwater. The new pavilion also houses two classrooms, a laboratory, an arcade with exhibits about whales and dolphins and a life-size sculpture of a humpback whale, plus a gift shop and food counter.    The aquarium is at Pier 3, 501 East Pratt Street (301-576-3860) in the Inner Harbor area. Among the 5,000 aquatic animals are sharks, ocean rays, large gamefish and seals, and there is a rain forest with Amazon parrots and iguanas and other reptiles.   The aquarium is open daily from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. (to 8 P.M. Friday) through May 14. Summer hours: 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Monday to Thursday and 9 A.M. to 8 P.M. Friday through Sunday.

Long lines form, and Rattlesnake doesn't take reservations, so come before you're famished.    9 p.m.  2 -- Moonlight in Vermont    Your sleep at a North Bennington bed-and-breakfast will be blissfully undisturbed by the sounds of traffic, but first get a nightcap at the awkwardly named Kevin's at Mike's Place, III (27 Main Street, North Bennington; 802-442-0122). This very local dive is packed with a mix of villagers and a Bennington College crowd. You will probably catch Linda Allard and Tim ''Terrific'' singing earnest Fleetwood Mac and Don McLean covers. Just go with it. Everybody else does.    Saturday    9 a.m.  3 -- Powers Breakfast    The 173-year-old Powers Market (9 Main Street, North Bennington; 802-442-6821) is the imposing but warm-hearted grandfather of the village. It began as a company store for the Thatcher and Welling Paper Mill and is now the place for coffee and all the gossip of a typical town meeting. A Portuguese muffin with egg, cheese and smoked salmon ($3) should fuel you for the morning ahead.    10 a.m.  4 -- Kill Time on the Kill    Instead of a hike during Vermont's mud season, float past the muck on the Batten Kill, a river that empties into the Hudson. Both beginning and advanced paddlers can watch the Equinox mountains idle into view from a rented canoe or kayak from BattenKill Canoe (6328 Route 7A, Arlington; 802-362-2800; www.battenkill.com; opens on Thursday). Start at the shop and be picked up at the end of your trip. Rentals are $30 to $60.    1 p.m.  5 -- Pictures at an Exhibition    Bennington College, which claims Jonathan Lethem and Sally Mann among its alumni, offers lectures and performing arts events, often free and open to the public (1 College Drive, Bennington; 802-442-5401; www.bennington.edu). On view at the Usdan Gallery (usdan.bennington.edu) through May 8 are photographs from the college's collection by masters of the street scene -- Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Robert Doisneau, Lee Friedlander and Garry Winogrand. The Bennington Museum -- not affiliated with the college -- is famous for its collection of Grandma Moses art and memorabilia, the largest in the country. The museum (75 Main Street, Bennington; 802-447-1571; www.benningtonmuseum.org) also mounts shows like the Smithsonian's exhibition on the Mohawk iron workers who helped build New York's skyscrapers (opening May 20) and a rare exhibition of Rembrandt etchings (opening June 1).    3:30 p.m.  6 -- Village of the Arts    Back in North Bennington, the village is worth exploring on foot. The textile artist Leigh Orcutt, 25, is the owner of Bread (25 Main Street, North Bennington; no phone; www.breadandbirds.com), her storefront and studio where Ms. Orcutt, above, sews while customers browse her deconstructed graphic T-shirts ($22) and knit wool-felt purses ($50). She also sells the work of 13 other artists. Then cut across the bridge to the Vermont Arts Exchange (28 Sage Street, North Bennington; 802-442-5549), housed in the Sage Street Mill. The husband-and-wife team of Matthew Perry and Patricia Pedreira dedicate the former cotton mill to art classes, community outreach programs and a gallery, which through June 9 is showing hooked rugs with unexpected themes (God banishing Adam and Eve from Eden, someone's funny-faced Chihuahua). One room at the exchange becomes a bar-lounge home to the Basement Music Series, which attracts acts like the Howard Fishman Quartet, Tessa Souter and Alash, throat singers of Tuva -- kind of like a Park Slope bistro in the Green Mountains.    7 p.m.  7 -- A City Meal in the Country    An oasis more than a supercontinent, the North Bennington restaurant Pangaea (1 & 3 Prospect Street, 802-442-7171) is a fine-dining salve for those used to the flawless choices in Manhattan. The atmosphere and the food are warm without any country tack. Appetizers ($12 to $18) like seared diver scallops with pommes Maxim and truffle cream are a precursor to entrees ($33 to $38) like a pan-seared venison tenderloin with a St. AndrÃ© potato croquette or a root vegetable Wellington. If you've saved room for dessert, walk directly next door to Pangaea's red-walled and livelier lounge for an after-dinner drink and a sweet. The lounge has its own menu.    Sunday    10 a.m.  8 -- Big House, Big Horse    4The Park-McCullough House (1 Park Street, North Bennington; 802-442-5441; www.parkmccullough.org) is really a Victorian mansion built in 1865 with spoils from the California gold rush. It opens for tours again in mid-May, but it's the Mile-Around Woods behind the property and the deer that frolic in them that shouldn't be missed. Take a before-breakfast walk on the groomed trails -- the entrance is on broad, tree-lined Park Street, marked by a break in the low stone wall. On your way to the entrance of the woods you'll probably pass David and Nancy Lively's American Creams, below, in the pastures, the only draft horse breed to originate in the United States. If you want more of an encounter than an indifferent nod, call the Livelys for a carriage ride around North Bennington and through a couple of the area's covered bridges. You might be hitched up with Allison, a pink-skinned, amber-eyed beauty that knows the route by heart. (Lively's Livery, 802-447-7612; www.livelyslivery.com)    Noon  9 -- Miles to Go Before I Sleep    In 1920, Robert Frost moved to a house in Shaftsbury, just north of North Bennington. Today it's the Robert Frost Stone House Museum (121 Route 7A, Shaftsbury; 802-447-6200; www.frostfriends.org; opens May 2), and you can stand in the dining room where, one hot June morning after a sleepless night, Frost wrote ''Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.'' Frost said of the Stone House that he meant ''to plant a new Garden of Eden with a thousand apple trees of some unforbidden variety'' there, and -- though the orchard is now overgrown -- he did achieve his goal. His grave is a few miles down the road in the churchyard behind the Old First Congregational Church in Old Bennington (Monument Avenue and Route 9, 802-447-1223).    2 p.m.  10 -- Yogurt for the Road    Get one last look at the Green Mountains after climbing the long hill out of Vermont to the Berle Farm (319 Beechwood Road, Hoosick, N.Y.; 518-686-3249). The bleat of Saanen goats repeats in your ears and the smell of lanolin coats your nostrils in the almost pitch-black farm store, where payment is on the honor system: leave your cash in the tin cup. Choose from certified organic products like cow's milk yogurt ($4), stone-ground cornmeal ($2.50 a bag) and various goat cheeses ($10 a pound) to take with you. Pet the unflappable, heavy-lidded farm cats on your way out, and you're homeward bound.    A Small TownAs a Work of Art       A car is the best way to let southern Vermont's mountains and farms project a moving picture. North Bennington is about 190 miles from Manhattan and 40 miles from Albany International Airport.      The Henry House Inn (1338 Murphy Road, North Bennington; 888-442-7045; www.henryhouseinn.com), built in 1769, overlooks a covered bridge and the Walloomsac River. There are six rooms at $85 to $135; breakfast is included.      The Eddington House Inn (21 Main Street, North Bennington; 800-941-1857; www.eddingtonhouseinn.com), an 1857 house in the heart of the village, has three uncluttered rooms starting at $89. Breakfast and an afternoon snack are included. The inn is offering several spa and dining packages this spring.     The new Hampton Inn (51 Hannaford Square, Bennington; 802-440-9862; www.hamptoninnbennington.com) has a view of a Home Depot but is equidistant from North Bennington and Bennington. There are 80 rooms, an indoor pool and an exercise center. A standard room is $99; suites are $109 to $149. Breakfast is included. 36 Hours in North Bennington, Vt."},{"year":"1986","title":"Question: We would like to spend 10 days bicycling in Vermont, New Hampshire or Maine in June, staying in local inns.

Today the island named for this resourceful god, 48 miles long and in the middle of the Hawaiian chain, is a famous playground of the wealthy, with first-class resorts, verdant golf courses and one-name property owners like Oprah and Tiger. But just behind that facade is the natural Maui, where clean rivers from deep ancient valleys tumble into the ocean amid lush tropical vegetation, with the huge Haleakala Crater commanding center stage. Where else can you people-watch on a picture-book beach and a couple of hours later gaze over a lava field and think you're on the moon?    CHARLES E. ROESSLER    Friday    4 p.m.  1 -- Cool It    Relax and shut out the world in the serene space under the huge banyan tree outside the Old Lahaina Courthouse, also known as the Court and Custom House (648 Wharf Street, 808-667-9175), in the historic town of Lahaina. This single tree, with multiple tentacles taking root from overhanging branches, shades nearly an acre. Envision the town when this was a raucous whaling port, and step inside the courthouse, built in 1859 and now a visitors center, to get the story of the men who chased the whales and see examples of the tools they used. Nearby, on Prison Street, is Hale Paahao, or Stuck-in-Irons House, where sailors sometimes landed after having a ''go at the rum.'' Stroll Front Street for an intense tourist blast, with shops that sell scrimshaw, artworks and shell jewelry -- and plenty of places for a snack or a cool drink.    6:30 p.m.  2 -- History and Showmanship    ''Ulalena,'' performed on a multimillion-dollar stage (878 Front Street, 877- 688-4800), is a theatrical feast for the senses, a tragic and beautiful depiction of Hawaii's history, mythology and people that was created with Roger Parent, a former producer with Cirque du Soleil. It's part music, part drama, part traditional dance and acrobatic feats, with spectacular lighting, costumes and special effects. Keep an eye on the musicians in the balcony, whose exuberance is a lively part of the show ($49.50 to $69.50, 6:30 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday).    8:30 p.m.  3 -- On the Water    Dine alfresco at Pacific'O (505 Front Street, 808-667-4341) and inhale the quiet Maui evening on the Lahaina waterfront. Have a mai tai ($8) at the bar, and then select from the seafood-laden menu with choices like mahi-mahi, ahi, ono and pink snapper (about $30), prepared contemporary Pacific style. The organic vegetables come from the restaurant's own upcountry farm.    Saturday    9 a.m.  4 -- Can You Dig It?    Drop by the self-consciously named Dig Me Beach on the Kaanapali Coast north of Lahaina and charge yourself up with a morning dip. Look out over a deep blue ocean at Lanai and Molokai and then back at the sand, where bikinied exhibitionists are already taking in the sun.    11 a.m.  5 -- Eye of the Needle    Drive south on Route 30 and curve north to Route 32, which ends inland at Iao Valley State Monument near the town of Wailuku. Cool and windy, thickly grown with tropical vegetation, the valley was the scene of a brutal battle in 1790 between the forces of King Kamehameha, who unified the islands, and Maui's native defenders. The struggle was so violent that bodies clogged a stream and turned the water red. Today, there's a small display of indigenous Hawaiian plants and taro patches. And at the top of a 133-step climb, you get a close look at the large green rock called the Iao Needle, a phallic wonder of nature.    Noon  6 -- Samurai Lunch    You won't find many tourists at Tokyo Tei (1063 East Lower Main Street, Wailuku","excerpt":"808-242-9630), but you will find an excellent teriyaki chicken plate ($8.75) and shrimp tempura ($11.50). The owner, Eunice Kitagawa, will patiently explain decorations including a set of samurai swords and ukiyoe, traditional woodblock prints. ''My grandfather, who was a sumotori in Japan, jumped ship in 1934 and opened the original Tokyo Tei in 1935,'' she says. Ask her about the time in 1964 when more than 20 sumotori -- sumo wrestlers -- came for dinner.    1 p.m.  7 -- Upcountry    Take a short ride to Hookipa Beach just past the hippie hangout town of Paia and park at the lookout. If you're lucky, a big swell will be rolling in and you will be able to see the perfectly toned local surfers testing their nerves just 100 yards away. It's a great photo opportunity. Get back in the car and take a leisurely drive up scenic Baldwin Avenue toward the Haleakala Crater. Stop at the Surfing Goat Dairy (3651 Omapio Road, Kula; 808-878-2870) for cheese or at the Tedeschi Vineyards (Ulupalakua, 877-878-6058) for a sip of wine. At the Alii Kula Lavender Farm (1100 Waipouli Road, Kula; 808-878-3004), you can see fields of lavender and have a lavender scone ($2) with lavender herb tea ($5).    4:30 p.m.  8 -- House of the Sun    Arriving at Haleakala National Park ($10 a car, 808-572-4400; www.nps.gov/hale) for the sunset is a better option than the popular trip at sunrise, when the park is packed with tourists. The crater area is a must see in the late afternoon as the sky's colors constantly change and the sun sets on the moonlike landscape. It will be cool enough for a jacket, and there are few amenities, but the experience is spiritual. You'll be invigorated in the altitude around 10,000 feet above sea level. And despite being among the most spectacular natural wonders on earth, Haleakala is no tourist trap.    7:30 p.m.  9 -- A Taste of Italy    Hope that the part-owner, Steven Burgelin, originally from Milan, is in the house to escort you to your table at Casanovas (1188 Makawao Avenue, Makawao; 808-572-0220) on the road back from the park -- a rustic restaurant that's a perfect close to an upcountry adventure. The original building dates from before World War II, and stories are told of Hawaiian cowboys riding their horses into the bar for a shot of redeye. Check out the artificial-looking but real garden outside the back window as you enjoy an organic salad ($6 to $9), pasta dish ($10 to $19) and meat or fish entrÃ©e ($22 to $28). Or try one of the wood-fired Neapolitan-style pizzas ($12 to $20).    Sunday    7 a.m.  10 -- Underwater    A number of different-size catamarans and boats carry people out to Molokini Island, a crater rising above sea level where marine life gathers. Arrange a reservation on one of the charters out of Maalaea on Maalaea Bay for the 50-minute cruise to the island. You'll snorkel or scuba on the lee side of the crater with a variety of colorful fish over a reef 10 to 20 feet below the surface. If you are lucky, you may rate a visit from an endangered Hawaiian monk seal that is not at all shy. After a simple lunch, sip a mai tai or two on the casual ride back, which may also include a stop at an area of underwater rocks called Turtle Town, where you can hang out with the sea turtles and an occasional ray. Call ahead for reservations (About $90;, Friendly Charters, 808-244-1979; or Aloha Blue Charters, 808-249-2583).    THE BASICS    A Middle Link In the Chain       THE Kahului Airport on Maui is a 35-minute flight from Honolulu. Car rentals are recommended (from about $30 a day) and readily available from all major companies.

There are about 80 works between the two sites, together forming a comprehensive, 20-year survey of his artwork in various mediums: screen prints, stencils, stickers, album covers, collage, spray paint and more.

The prix fixe seven-course dinner at Restaurant Lafayette, for example, is $95, but a streamlined sampling, a three-course lunch for $25, is now being served. Last week, the menu included starters like fresh shrimp in a spicy carrot-juice sauce, and pork cheeks pan-fried with a black-bean salad in an arugula vinaigrette. Main courses, like the cod cakes with an orange and basil oil, and the beef tenderloin stuffed with marrow and chive oil, were toothsome examples of the imaginative and energetic cuisine of the chef Jean-George Vongerichten. (Restaurant Lafayette, 65 East 56th Street","excerpt":"832-1565).   Prunelle, the sleek, burled-wood-walled dining room, recently introduced a dinner menu that includes several homier French dishes -- and a $38 price tag for a three-course meal. Old-fashioned dishes like the onion soup and the cassoulet, as well as such contemporary fare as the scallops with a blini and three caviars, and the sweetbreads sauteed with wild mushrooms and wild rice, were all winners -- and the value is hard to beat in the tony, midtown restaurant league. (Prunelle, 18 East 54th Street; 759-6410).   Downtown, Anglers and Writers, an eclectic little storefront full of mismatched antique tables and china, fishing gear and lace doilies, is the winsome cafe-cousin of the Village Atelier restaurant. The owners, Craig Bero and his mother, Charlotte, serve good salads and sandwiches, a tender omelet and sturdy soups. It's hard to spend more than $10 for lunch, tea or dinner. And between the contemplative chamber music and the scratch of pen-to-notebook at the tables, the mood at Anglers and Writers recalls old Village Bohemia, an era when this kind of price and the ease to linger was not the exception but the rule.

The first exhibition to bask in the one-third-larger, more open, light-infused two-story space is that of the basket maker Hisako Sekijima. \\n\\nMs. Sekijima's distinction is in cherishing open space as much as the forms she creates to extol it. She starts from the inside, conjuring a vacuum, then creating a basket-sculpture to surround it. The artist, who was born in Japan, has lived in the United States and France as well, and she has studied contemporary basket making, American Indian basketry and splint basketry. \\n\\nHer works have been exhibited at the American Craft Museum, the California Craft Museum and Hokkaido-Asahikawa Museum. They are part of the permanent collections of the Erie Art Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Hawaii State Foundation for Culture and Art.\\n\\nShe is also the author of books on basket making including \\"Basketry: Projects From Baskets to Grass Slippers\\" (Kodansha International Ltd., Japan) and presents workshops and lectures throughout the United States and Japan.\\n\\nHer constructions are woven of natural materials -- bamboo, wisteria, kudzu vine, mulberry and willow bark. In what the artist considers a collaboration with nature, Ms. Sekijima said, \\"I let my materials do the talking.\\"\\n\\nThe exhibition, on view through July 17 at the six-year-old gallery owned by Rhonda Brown and Tom Grotta, exudes a feeling of spatial containment common in Japanese sculpture and related to Zen concepts.\\n\\nIn balancing material and space, form and volume, Ms. Sekijima thinks of space as a negative as opposed to the positive of tangible materials like vine, sticks or bark.\\n\\nIn her view, the part that the materials fill has a value equal to that where they do not exist, as in the relation of positive and negative. The result, said Janet Kopolos, senior editor of \\"Art in America\\" and author of \\"Contemporary Japanese Sculpture\\" (Abbeville Press, New York City), is work that \\"cannot be physically or conceptually distinguished from sculpture.\\"\\n\\nEach of the 12 pieces in the exhibition, which took a year to prepare, has its own distinctive identity. \\"We had seen her work, but not two that were similar, when Jack Lenor Larsen, the textile designer, author and great cheerleader for crafts, came to dinner,\\" Mr. Grotta said. \\"We asked him who he thought belonged in our gallery. She was the No. 1 artist recommended.\\"\\n\\nBecause each piece is a distinct form, as if made by a different artist, each invites study and the search for a common thread. The pieces are grouped in a living-room setting, on long low tables backing two black leather sofas. One, an airy cylindrical form that resembles a maze of tree branches, \\"is the favorite basket of almost everyone who walks in,\\" Mr. Grotta said. \\"Its strength lies in the infinite knots made of kudzu vine that give it shape, structure and stability. People are drawn to it for its airy quality and puzzle-like maze of knots.\\"\\n\\nAlthough there are always spaces to be found in Ms. Sekijima's work, one piece called \\"Fittings,\\" made of cherry bark fastened by knots of maple splint, is more substantial and looks like ceramic. Her use of knots here led to another exploration and to a piece using randomly interlaced bamboo in what became inner and outer bowl-shape baskets. Fitted ever so casually together, they emphasize angles as well as space.\\n\\nA coiled sphere, pleated of walnut bark with the texture of leather, has openings large enough to poke a finger through.\\n\\nMr. Grotta suggested that a piece shaped like an envelope was more traditional and in the Japanese esthetic. The sculpture is made of willow wood and bark, is folded and simply but strikingly stitched and has Henry Moore-like openings that invite viewers. \\n\\nOther pieces include a wreath-shape bowl of highly textured, light berry shavings wrapped and stitched in contrasting dark willow as well as a wall piece of six square panels hung together to form a rectangular form. \\nWhite Oak and Coralberry Root\\n\\n Although the baskets of the current exhibition are displayed in the living room, viewers are treated to an art-infused home with works from top weavers and basket makers from the moment they step over the threshold. \\n\\nAt the entrance, for example, is a bassinet of white oak and coralberry root by Sharon and Leon Niehues, woven for but now outgrown by the owners' 1-year-old son, Carter. In the youngster's room there are wall hangings, mobiles and sculptured basket works that seem fit for a future connoisseur. \\n\\n\\"Basket making over the last 10 years has made a transition from traditional and functional to the creation of contemporary baskets as an art form,\\" Rhonda Brown said. \\"And Ms. Sekijima's work with the use of traditional material and traditional techniques but nontraditional structures makes that clear.\\"\\n\\nThe Brown/Grotta Gallery (39 Grumman Hill Road, Wilton","excerpt":"834-0623) is open by appointment.

Annabeth (Jennifer Finnigan, right) prosecutes two teenagers for the murder of a man they claim was an online sexual predator. But then death hits even closer to home.    9 P.M. (NBC) CONVICTION -- In yet another episode ripped from the headlines, a bouncer becomes the prime suspect when a woman is murdered after leaving a bar. At 10, a courthouse shootout leaves the staff of the assistant district attorney's office otherwise occupied.    10 P.M. (CBS) NUMB3RS -- It's easy to blame Mom. In this season finale, Olympia Dukakis plays the mother of a rapist-turned-serial killer -- and you know where that story line is headed -- and JoBeth Williams portrays Margaret Eppes, the dead mother whose memory Charlie (David Krumholtz) has never laid to rest.    10 P.M. (CMT) UNSUNG STORIES -- Many a country song has sprung from a kernel of truth. That's the premise behind this new series in which professional songwriters take a real event and transform it into lyrics and music. First up, ''Jake's Goin' All the Way,'' an anthem by Jeffrey Steele and Keith Anderson (above right, with Mr. Steele) about a developmentally disabled teenager whose touchdown on a football field touched an entire community.

It seems that the public finds alarming, catchy statements more digestible than it does unexciting time-consuming statistical analyses. The usual official and journalistic view is that juvenile crime is violent, ever-increasing, and pervasive.   Nevertheless, the 1980 Uniform Crime Reports issued in September by the Justice Department draw an entirely different picture.

Del Posto (''Of the Place'') is the latest entry into Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich's restaurant empire, which includes Babbo, Lupa, Esca, Bistro du Vent, Otto, Casa Mono and Bar JamÃ³n. The menu covers lofty terrain: a Barolo risotto and a lobster risotto and a risotto with pumpkin and lardo.    FATTY CRAB  (212) 352-3590; 643 Hudson Street (Horatio Street): $; $25 and Under: 10/26/05.  Zak Pelaccio's rollicking Malaysian roadhouse is done up in dark woods and reds; ornately carved chairs with stiff backs are crammed around small tables that fill the tiny dining room. The signature chili crab consists of a Dungeness crab served in a delicious pool of spicy, crab-drenched sauce with broiled white bread to sop it up.    NERO  (212) 675-5224; 46 Gansevoort Street (Greenwich Street); $$; Article: 1/5/05.  This Italian place opened about a year ago in the space that housed the Moroccan restaurant Zitoune.

Vento is Steve Hanson's larger, more casual version of Fiamma Osteria, his three-star Italian restaurant in SoHo. The menu runs roughly parallel to the one at Fiamma, offering a highlight reel of all that is expected of an Italian menu in New York City right now: crudo to begin, some pizza in the middle, or pasta, followed by fish, or pork, or steak.

The 10-floor, 110-room hotel even houses a modeling agency, and boasts on its Web site of being ''a meld of Manhattan sophistication, South Beach sex appeal and Atlanta's own southern charm.'' But while the Glenn is not a bad place to stay, it could do without some of its tedious affectations: like many boutique hotels, its sophistication feels like a dousing of hair gel and cologne, and its sex appeal like a deluge of Reddi-wip, leaving little room for much Southern charm.    THE LOCATION -- A renovated 1923 office building in downtown Atlanta, within easy walking distance of the CNN Center, Centennial Olympic Park, Peachtree Center and the new Georgia Aquarium.    THE ROOMS -- My stay in late spring began with every guest's nightmare: my bed was a mess, looking as if someone had just had a romp in the sack. In disbelief, I convinced myself that it was merely a titillating ruse, a staged tableau in keeping with the hang tag on a bedside bottle of water that read ''I'm wet and refreshing.'' (Elsewhere, a boilerplate welcome note from the general manager was signed ''a k a vibemaster.'') But unfortunately, the real explanation was much simpler, as I found out only later: a housekeeping oversight. The unsettling introduction aside, my standard room, which was on a floor named Charming, was comfortably toned-down. Sheer iridescent curtains, an Aeron chair, dark wood cabinetry and ochre carpeting outfitted the respectably sized space.    THE BATHROOM -- Reflecting a growing trend in boutique hotels -- and an apparent desire among guests to combine washing up with a burlesque routine -- the shower stall opened to the rest of the room through a large window, barely obscured by a curtain of small metal beads. Other than that, the bathroom, which had no tub, was fairly basic, save for the rain flowing shower head and frou-frou H20+ body products.    AMENITIES -- All rooms come with Wi-Fi Internet service, an LCD screen television, and a combined CD player and alarm clock with an MP3 connection. There is a small fitness center in the basement, and B.E.D. operates a rooftop lounge with impressive views of the city.    ROOM SERVICE -- Guests can order food from B.E.D., including a $12 eggs Benedict breakfast and a $20 bouillabaisse for dinner. But my first concern was the television, which wouldn't switch on. Needing assistance, I pressed the telephone's ''Anytime, Anyplace'' button, which was more like ''No Answer, Nohow,'' while the ''Your Desires'' button sent me into voice mail. Score another one for the old-fashioned way: pushing ''0'' finally yielded an operator who said a technician would be in touch. His call came within seconds, and the problem was quickly resolved.    THE CROWD -- Denzel Washington, Usher and Nikki Hilton have all stayed at the hotel. On the Tuesday night I was there, four young women, who looked as if they had watched a few too many episodes of ''Sex and the City,'' picked at their food at B.E.D. In the lobby bar, the scene evolved from one of silver-haired suits to a mix of music industry types, salon-fresh women and business-casual men sipping cocktails with R-rated names like Heavy Petting. A discretionary dress code (no baseball caps, for starters) is enforced on weekend nights.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- The scene may be overcooked, but the price is just right. Standard room rates are $189 a night, while the 16 Dream Suites go for $279 and the Jezebel penthouse suite is $750.

Shortly after play was resumed, Kasparov managed to increase his slight advantage by winning a pawn. It looked as if he was sitting before a feast that got better with every course.

This is the first production of HBO NYC, a new Home Box Office movie division based in New York. The film, undertaken in association with the BBC, was made in Ghana and England.         Highly sensitive issues are not ignored but, for the most part, only skimmed. Harboring of stowaways is severely punished by most governments. In New York, each one found costs the shipping company $45,000. In this instance, on a ship hobbled by the collapse of the Soviet Union, crews are paid poorly, actually making less than the dock workers get in Ghana. And then there's the nasty element of racial prejudice. One of the murderers rationalizes about the black Africans: \\"You saw how the police treated them in New York. It's the same everywhere.

There's an old African saying familiar to Americans from a Talking Heads song: \\"The world moves on a woman's hips.\\" Riske turns that metaphor into a musical reality with a French Caribbean beat. Ten women command the stage, with three singers and two dancers, who also play conga, up front. The group borrows from the sunny dance styles of compa and compa zouk, adding some Haitian \\"new generation\\" influences for spice. Originally from Haiti, Riske is now based in Queens, but rarely plays clubs. Don't wait until the next Caribbean street festival to catch this wave of female power. Tickets: $16 at the door, with shows today at 11 P.M. and 1 A.M. The Beret Type    Anna Domino, Fez, under the Time Cafe at 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Some people really seem at home wearing berets, especially French actresses, existential philosophers and chanteuses. Anna Domino is a bit of all these things. Having released several pensive recordings of modern rock balladry back in the new-wave era, when women were allowed to be weird, Ms. Domino never reached the stardom some thought she would attain. Her performance Saturday night should show if a few years' more world-weariness has enriched her talent. Tickets: $6. Doors open at 9 P.M. Shows are at 9:30 and 11 P.M. Chick Corea, Intensely    Chick Corea Akoustic Band + 2, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. Chick Corea can drift off into previously uncharted realms of pretentiousness, but this innovative pianist also revels in one of jazz's more intense performance styles. Where he'll take his audience depends on his mood, but it's guaranteed to be new territory. His companions for this weekend's musical journeys are John Patitucci, Bob Berg, Wallace Roney and Vinnie Colaiuta. Tickets: $40 with a $5 miniumum at a table, or $25 with a one-drink minimum at the bar. Shows at 9 P.M., 11:30 P.M. and 1:30 A.M. today and tomorrow","excerpt":"9 and 11:30 P.M. on Sunday.
