Major trading partners: exports: 44% U.S., 19% China; imports: 15% Portugal, 12% South Africa. Bantu peoples have occupied Angola for 2,000 years. Portuguese explorers searching for a sea route to India founded Luanda (1575) and Benguela (1617). Portugal, in alliance with the Angolan kingdom of Bakongo, engaged in an extensive trade of slaves to Brazil—3 million in 300 years. In the late 19th century, Angola was organized as a Portuguese colony, sometimes called Portuguese West Africa. Portuguese settlers dominated local government, and trade, organized plantation-style cultivation of cotton, palm oil, bananas, and coffee. A railroad was built to transport exports of metal from the Katanga region of the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) to the coast. By the 1950's non-Portuguese Angolans began to agitate for independence. The National Front spearheaded the liberation movement. Guerrilla warfare began in 1961, with several feuding factions fighting the Portuguese. Following the Portuguese revolution of 1974, factional warfare intensified and most Portuguese settlers fled the country. Independence came on Nov. 11, 1975. Civil war between the National Front, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led, in 1976, to the victory of the MPLA, which organized a Marxist state with Soviet backing and Cuban technical support including 37,000 soldiers. Large portions of the country remained in the hands of UNITA, which continued the civil war with Chinese and American support through the 1980's. Direct clashes between Angolan and South African troops occurred during the 1980's, as Angola gave shelter to SWAPO guerrilla forces seeking independence for Namibia. Cuban troops withdrew from Angola between January 1989 and May 1991, and a cease-fire between the government and UNITA was also concluded in May 1991. While agreeing to recognize the dos Santos government, UNITA called for elections to be held by Sept. 1992, Angola's first since 1975. In the elections, MPLA's candidate, José Eduardo dos Santos, decisively defeated UNITA's leader, Jonas Savimbi, but Savimbi's refusal to honor the results led to renewed fighting. The presence of thousands of U.N. peacekeepers from Feb. 1994 until Feb. 1999 made little dent in the continuing struggle which claimed perhaps 100,000 lives. The government succeeded, in 2000, in taking two diamond-mining provinces as well as the town of Cazombo from UNITA, capping the year with an offer of amnesty, in a gesture of reconciliation. But it was not until after Savimbi's death in a gun battle in Feb. 2002 that UNITA could be brought to sign a cease-fire in April which may signal an end to the long civil war. UNITA demobilization, a blanket amnesty, and recognition of UNITA as a legitimate political party are the main provisions. Angola"},{"year":"1969","title":"Cabinda...let's see.
