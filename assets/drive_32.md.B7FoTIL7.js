Surrealism, which flourished between the world wars, was largely driven by Freud's theories. Surrealist painters, writers and film makers hoped to transform culture by injecting it with the powerful energies generated  by subconscious mechanisms. The irrational, the erotic, the controlling, devouring, conflicted and repressed: artists like Breton, Miro, Bunuel, Magritte and Dali sought to draw into the daylight the primitive impulses Freud tried to  understand through the interpretation of dreams.         Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas, Jean Nouvel, Philippe Starck, Raimund Abraham -- some of the most highly regarded architects of today -- do not describe themselves as Surrealists. Nor will they necessarily welcome being tagged with the name of an art movement that not long ago was thought to have passed irretrievably into history. Their work is emphatically of the present. But, like Surrealism, it reckons with the dark turbulence and contradictions of the inner  life.

Today his goal is less perilous but equally challenging: endearing New Yorkers to the multifaceted cuisine of his native region around Rome.  Sandro's cadre of regular patrons offers proof that to some extent he is succeeding.   Six-year-old Sandro's is not the kind of place you stumble upon. It is well concealed in the lobby of a high-rise apartment building on far East 59th Street, hard under the rumbling 59th Street Bridge.  The big, casual dining room has a terra-cotta floor, palm trees and walls covered with framed posters of Italian food products. In such a neighborhood setting, captains in black tie seem incongruous.   Upon being seated, you are presented a basket of terrific rosemary bread and \\"dare you to eat just one\\" sage-and-rosemary breadsticks. You will find that the wine list is strongest among Italian reds and whites, with a smattering of American labels, all on the moderate to high side. As we were discussing the wine and other matters, a captain barged in -- a common and annoying occurrence -- and recited his daily specials. When we wanted him, though, he was nowhere to be found. Another captain took the wine order and, a mere 20 minutes later, returned with it. Service in general was maladroit. The amiable Mr. Fioriti, though, was a most cordial host, stopping by every table to ask how the food turned out.   We had no complaints about the ravioli filled with spinach and ricotta afloat in a beautifully balanced tomato-cream sauce, nor with the crisply fried artichokes, their dark golden leaves as brittle as puff pastry. The most compelling pasta dish was ravioli filled with sea urchin roe in a subtle tomato sauce studded with minced baby scallops. The oceanic sea urchin flavor burst through with every bite, and the light tomato sauce allowed it to shine.   Quality pancetta and pecorino cheese were the foundation of a dish recommended by our captain, but the sauce was not integrated and the pasta was unevenly sauced. Spaghetti with clams on the half shell, a touch of tomato and herbs had a lusty shellfish flavor. Penne tossed with mild Italian sausage and cream was too timorous and lacking pepper for my taste.   Among nonpasta starters, tender sauteed baby calamari with radicchio and tomato had everything going for it but flavor. Garlic or hot pepper would have helped. Ice cold carpaccio with olive oil and slices of Parmesan was hard to judge until it warmed on the plate. Then it was pleasing.   Main courses here could sustain a pair of soccer players for the day. The roast suckling pig, a special, has a wonderful burnished skin concealing a thin layer of fat that adds moisture to the succulent meat. Equally good, if not better, was roasted baby lamb with a blackened crust and aroma of rosemary. One of the house favorites seems to be straccetti, grilled slices of beef that had been coated in olive oil, garlic and lemon. The vibrantly flavored meat is exceptionally tender. Fennel sausages with bitter broccoli were a fine combination, too. Butterflied Cornish hen, though, which can be savory when grilled, is fried here, which leaves it a bit heavy and bland.   Among the seafood, salt cod cooked with potatoes, onions and tomatoes is firm and flavorful, reminiscent of traditional Portuguese recipes. Grilled swordfish, a special, was lustrous in a pool of white wine sauce scented with lemon and basil.  It came with grilled endive. Only grouper braised with artichokes in a lemony wine sauce came out flat and one-dimensional.   Another one of Mr. Fioriti's regional dishes is the polenta pudding with raspberry sauce. Surprisingly, the pudding was ultra-smooth with no grain detected. We later learned that a fine grade of polenta, almost flourlike, is used. Chocolate mousse cake is relatively light and intense with good bittersweet chocolate. And chocolate-dusted tartuffo is a special treat, as is granita of expresso (although granita of lemon is watered down).   The first time we visited the restaurant, we were victims of Mr. Fioriti's puckish sense of humor.  Toward the end of our main courses, he came by and insisted we try a platter of his favorite pasta.  We groaned. As we finished our desserts, he came over holding a platter over his head. \\"Pasta, Pasta!\\" he announced as we all cringed. He then placed in front of us a platter of warm sugar cookies. Then came a selection of his homemade fruit grappas. Peach was our favorite.   Sandro Fioriti is the type of host who makes sure you never leave hungry. And if you order wisely, you'll leave happy, too. Pamir    Afghan food, which not long ago was as obscure as it was exotic, has moved into the dining mainstream in major cities. In New York City, for example, diners can choose from more than a half-dozen serious Afghan restaurants and many more living-room-size family cafes. Pamir, a congenial spot on Second Avenue in Manhattan, has always been one of my favorites.   Afghan food is a melange of Middle Eastern cuisine with some spicy Indian accents tossed in.  Lamb, chicken, rice and vegetables are the primary ingredients. Exotic herbs and spices give the food its allure.   Pamir's dining room is a long, shadowy expanse with a bar at one end. Oriental rugs, assorted wall hangings and soft Eastern music contribute to its mysterious feeling. Candlelit tables are tightly arranged to accommodate the enthusiastic nightly crowds. Over the course of three visits, I found that service is not as sharp as it used to be. Orders are occasionally confused and servers are not always as diligent about getting drinks, bread, water and the like.   The menu rarely changes, so it takes only one visit to become familiar with the specialties. Starters include sambosa goushti, triangles of greaseless fried pastry stuffed with a mixture of ground beef and chickpeas redolent of cinnamon and cumin","excerpt":"bulanee gandana, thin, blistered turnovers filled with scallions and herbs that are eaten with a tart yogurt sauce; bulanee kachalou, another turnover, stuffed with mashed potatoes, onions and spices, and aushak, crisp flat scallion-filled raviolis under a lovely yogurt sauce with ground meat and mint. All of the turnovers go well with some fiery cumin and coriander sauce.   Beer is probably the most suitable beverage with this tangy food, although certain full-bodied red wines from the perfunctory list might stand up to the spices. Oddly enough, Pamir has a menu of tropical cocktails. The barman makes a mean margarita, although I wouldn't try it with a spicy yogurt sauce.   Two popular main-course dishes are badenjan chalaw, a spicy mixture of cubed lamb, eggplant, tomatoes and onions, and sabsi-chalaw, lamb in a mellow spinach sauce flavored with onions and garlic. A daily special was a winner, too: zardak chalaw, stewed lamb with carrots, onions, garlic and ginger.   One of my favorites has always been a colorful creation called norange palaw, a circular mound of saffron rice laced with almonds, pistachios and thin strips of orange zest. Beneath the rice is an aromatic lamb stew that, when mixed with the rice, can yield a complex and subtle melange of flavors and textures. A recent sampling, however, was woefully unbalanced. The rice was overloaded with sweet orange zest and cloying with rosewater.  Quabilli palaw, a similar lamb dish made with brown rice, almonds, pistachios, raisins and carrot strips instead of orange, was better balanced, but some of the lamb was mushy from overmarination.   Among meat entrees, there is only one escape from lamb. Kabab-e-murgh features skewered marinated chicken cubes with vegetables. On two samplings, the chicken was dryish, ameliorated somewhat by the coriander dipping sauce.   Side dishes to consider are sabsi, a puree of spinach with onions and assorted spices (ours arrived at room temperature); buranee kadu, sauteed chunks of pumpkin topped with yogurt and ground beef, and buranee badenjan, delicious sauteed eggplant with a garnish of the same yogurt meat sauce.   Desserts take some getting used to. Firnee is a firm, semisweet pudding studded with almonds and pistachios. Baghlawa is a form of baklava, made with brittle layers of pastry and sweetened walnuts. Gosh-e-feel is the most exotic, a pizza-size piece of fried dough dusted with cardamon, pistachios and confectioners' sugar.    While Pamir still has exotic (and economic) appeal, the lapses in service and food merit a reduction from two stars, which it received in 1987, to one star.

Economists and political experts are also confused. When the markets started  dropping, most analysts said it was because the economy was overheating, and that the resulting inflation would lead to higher interest rates.

This would bring the daily tally of American losses to 14 killed in action, 26 airmen missing in action and 8 confirmed as prisoners of war. The U.S. Central Command in Riyadh did not provide an overall count. A Saudi spokesman said 18 Saudi soldiers were killed in the fighting at Khafji last week, 29 were wounded and 4 were missing. A Qatari spokesman said he had no casualties to report. Aircraft: In addition to the B-52 bomber lost on its way back to base, an AH-1 Cobra with two aboard and a UH-1 helicopter carrying four crashed over Saudi Arabia. But the U.S. Central Command's briefer in Riyadh did not add them to the daily cumulative count of aircraft losses because, he said, they were believed to be \\"non-combat-related.\\" The command said combat losses as such stood at 15 American and 7 other coalition aircraft, for a total of 22. IRAQI FORCES Troops: The number of Iraqi prisoners grew to \\"some 800,\\" according to the United States command. No reliable data on other or military or civilian losses were available. Aircraft: The Riyadh command's count of aircraft destroyed while parked or bunkered rose sharply to at least 99 and as many as 140, since some bunkers sheltered more than one.
