The park service could begin recovering costs from guide companies in 1996, and from individuals by 1997, said Ron Hooper, superintendent of the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.  Though the term \\"high risk activities\\" has yet to be fully defined, it will likely run the gamut from hiking to kayaking, he said, adding that those rescued in areas easily accessible by road will be exempt. The park service is exploring the option of allowing companies and individuals to buy insurance to cover the risks of their activities, a practice common in Europe, he said. Rescues of injured or lost tourists are a drain on the park service's resources, he said. In 1994, taxpayers paid about $581,395, based on 1.24 Canadian dollars  to the United States dollar, for rescues in the Yukon, British Columbia and Alberta national parks, he said. Average cost of each rescue was $375, not including staff training, helicopter time and equipment. Rescues that last for days can drive the cost into the thousands of dollars, Mr. Hooper said.

Its Mediterranean ports were frequented by Phoenician traders, and part of the country was incorporated into the empire of Carthage. Spain fell under the Roman Empire around 200 B.C.; Roman rule ended when the Visigoths invaded and took control of the Iberian Peninsula in the fifth century. The Visigoths adopted Christianity but were in turn conquered by Moors from northwest Africa in A.D. 711. The Berber/Arab civilization of the Moors produced the most elegant and cultivated culture in medieval Europe, and was an important conduit for the reintroduction of Greek science into Europe in the 12th century. The Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula began almost immediately after the Moors had established themselves and proceeded slowly but steadily over a period of 750 years. The consolidation of the region's small, contentious Christian kingdoms came with the marital alliance of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469. Granada, the last Moorish outpost in Spain, fell to the forces of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492, just as Columbus, with Isabella's sponsorship, was discovering the lands that were to become Spain's New World empire. Under the Inquisition, begun in 1478, Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, and Muslims in 1502. Under the Habsburg dynasty (1516–1700), Spain reached the zenith of its power and prestige around the year 1600 (despite the 1588 defeat of the Spanish Armada by England), controlling an empire that embraced nearly all of South America (except Brazil), Central America, Mexico, western North America, the Philippines, and smaller territories in Africa and Asia. But Spain's loss of the Netherlands, endless struggles with the French in Europe and the Turks in the Mediterranean, and relentless inflation caused by imports of New World silver—all took their toll. During the 18th century, the Bourbons ruled a declining but still powerful Spain, until Napoleon installed his brother as king in 1808. After Napoleon's defeat, the Bourbons returned in 1814, but the loss of the South American colonies, three dynastic wars, and a brief republican interlude after 1868 were all signs of progressive weakness. The crowning blow to Spanish power and prestige was the loss of the Spanish-American War to the United States in 1898, leading to the independence of Cuba and the American takeover of Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Spain remained neutral in World War I. In 1923 Primo de Rivera established a dictatorship; he was forced out of office by King Alfonso XIII in 1930, but in 1931 the king was forced to abdicate. A republic replaced the monarchy. Its volatile mixture of socialism, anticlericalism, and decentralization provoked a right-wing reaction. The government moved to the Right, and in 1934 a miner's strike in Asturia was put down with great bloodshed. A left-wing government was elected in 1936 and deposed in a coup, which led to the terrible Civil War of 1936–39, in which Spain became a battleground for competing world ideologies. The Nationalists, aided by Hitler and Mussolini, defeated the Republicans, aided by Stalin and by leftist volunteers from many countries. Out of the wreckage emerged the dictatorship of the intensely patriotic and Catholic general Francisco Franco. At the time of the Civil War, Spain was still an agricultural country, with small holdings in the north and great estates in the south. In the Basque country, the mining of iron, copper, and lead provided both exports and a domestic iron and steel industry, which had been the case since the 19th century. In the 20th century, shipbuilding and chemicals were added to the traditional textile industries of the Mediterranean coastal cities. The war largely destroyed this industrial base, which was not rebuilt until the 1950's. Except for a contingent of troops sent to fight with the German invaders of the Soviet Union, Spain remained precariously neutral during World War II; Franco declined to repay Hitler for his support in the Civil War. But wartime Spain, despite its neutrality, could not muster the resources to undertake national reconstruction. In postwar Europe, the Franco regime seemed like a remnant of the fascism of the 1930's; Stalin's active hostility led the United Nations to treat Spain as an international pariah. At home Franco represented peace and stability; few Spaniards were willing to risk a return to civil strife by opposing him. Over time the military and Catholic aspects of the regime grew more pronounced, while fascist elements were downplayed. In 1947 the Law of Succession made Spain a monarchy without a king, awaiting the restoration of the throne in the post-Franco era. The Cold War led to friendlier American relations with Spain and the establishment of American military bases in 1953. U.N. membership followed in 1955. Despite some resultant growth in international trade, Spain's economy lagged, with industrialization barely beginning. In 1958 Franco turned the direction of the economy over to a group of technocrats, mostly neoliberal members of the Opus Dei lay Catholic order. With U.S. economic and military aid, a growing tourist industry, increased foreign investment, and, especially, freer markets, the economy revived. Older industries like iron, steel, and textiles were rejuvenated, while newer ones, such as chemicals, plastics, automobile assembly, and power plants, were created. Agriculture was increasingly mechanized, and it shifted to export-oriented ranching and horticulture. In 1967 Franco proclaimed the Organic Law, which, while confirming him as head of state, granted some independence to the Cortes (legislature) and permitted heads of families to vote for some of its delegates. This, along with a relaxation of censorship, softened the growing opposition to the regime among students, labor unions, and regional separatists. In 1969 Prince Juan Carlos was named heir apparent to the Spanish throne. Franco died in 1975 and was duly succeeded by Juan Carlos. With the new prime minister, Adolfo Suarez, the king worked to liberalize the Franco inheritance: Political parties were legalized; the Cortes was transformed into a bicameral legislature, with both houses elected by universal suffrage; the first elections since 1936 were held; and a new constitution was promulgated—all by 1978. In 1980, Catalonia and the Basque country were granted home rule, following overwhelming plebiscite victories. In the Basque lands, however, violent terrorist agitation for complete independence continues to this day. Under the new monarchy, Spain became a full participant in the affairs of Europe. It joined the Council of Europe in 1977, NATO in 1982, and the E.U. in 1986. The Socialist Workers' party controlled both houses of the Cortes from 1982 to 1996, but the party abandoned both Marxism and the traditional labor radicalism of prewar Spain. Instead, it resembled the mainstream Social Democratic parties of Western Europe. Under Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez Marquéz, Spain was for a time the economic darling of Europe. GDP grew by an average of almost 5 percent between 1986 and 1990, and business investment jumped by over 10 percent a year. In 1992, the Summer Olympics in Barcelona and the Universal Exposition in Seville focused world attention on two very different parts of Spain. But the economic growth slowed in 1992, unemployment reached 22 percent, and the conservative Popular party made strong gains in the Cortes in 1993. In 1994, Gonzalez's power eroded when several members of his government were indicted for their involvement with an antiterrorist death squad accused of assassinating 27 Basque separatists during the 1980's. After 10 years of Gonzalez and the Socialists, the May 1996 elections brought the Popular Party and its leader Jose Maria Aznar to governmental power (the Popular Party being supported by, though without a formal coalition with, Basque and Catalan nationalists). In July 1998, 12 officials of the Gonzalez government were sentenced to jail for crimes in the anti-Basque “dirty war,” although Gonzalez himself was not implicated. Spain's economy quickly reversed itself and annual growth surpassed three percent, so that Spain was able to meet the criteria for membership in the European Monetary Union. Somewhat unexpectedly the E.T.A., the Basque terrorist organization, declared on September 16, 1998, a “total and indefinite” cease-fire. But despite talks with the Aznar government and the release of “political prisoners,” the E.T.A., in late 1999, resumed its war with car-bombings and assassinations. In March 2000, the Popular Party won an unexpected majority (183 of 350 seats) in the Congresso (lower house). In Sept. 2002, two important leaders of E.T.A. were captured in France and government officials believed the group, responsible for over 800 deaths, would be crippled.
