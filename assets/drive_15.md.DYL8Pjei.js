Occupying the Loeb Drama Center at Harvard, he brought with him from Yale a core staff and some of the company and, most important, an ideal of creating a resident professional acting ensemble performing new plays and classics in rotating repertory.   The Boston area had not had a resident theater company since the late 1960's and had never supported a major institutional theater akin to the Guthrie in Minneapolis or the Actors Theater of Louisville. Theatrically, Boston was best known for its commercial theaters, which booked roadshows and Broadway tryouts, and for its highly transient student population.

It is a pretty film that wavers between soft-core pornography and social comment, without ever involving the viewer emotionally.   Where once the novel was regarded as revolutionary in its use of four-letter words as a liberating force for Lady Chatterley's deprived sexual life with her war-wounded husband, somehow the occasionally outspoken language in the film does not have that almost angry insistent quality.

The 19th-century disk will be of greater interest to those seeking unusual material, for it features three rarely heard character pieces by Mauro Giuliani, one of the period's great virtuoso players and a prolific composer whose music remains at the heart of the instrument's literature.   Mr. Fernandez draws a great deal from these brief pieces. In ''Il Sentimentale,'' he evokes orchestral textures, and shapes ''L'Allegria'' as if it were a transcription of an operatic aria. In ''La Melanconia,'' on the other hand, Guiliani seemed less intent on escaping the guitar's limitations (if only through illusion), and Mr. Fernandez responds to its more introspective mood with pensive and subtly colored playing.

BLUE RIDGE, by T. R. Pearson. (Viking, $24.95.) A literary novelist turns his hand to crime in a novel that alternates between a lawman's exegesis of bones on the Appalachian Trail and the concerns of his cousin, an alienated actuary whose son (whom he barely remembers) has come to grief.    ACROSS AN UNTRIED SEA: Discovering Lives Hidden in the Shadow of Convention and Time, by Julia Markus. (Knopf, $27.95.)
