Their peripatetic cameras provide us with precious little of the blood-chilling jungle combats which enlivened the photographic safaris of other years even when their authenticity was open to grave doubts. \\"Baboona,\\" which is an account of an aerial safari over Africa, is content to be a placid and comparatively academic study of the African fauna, stressing the amusing phases of travel in the Dark Continent. It is only in the final section of the film, when some trouble-making hyenas and leopards invade an orderly settlement of baboons, that the work emerges from its Sunday picture mood and goes in for any extended excitement.It was this reporter's impression that \\"Baboona\\" devotes an unconscionable sum of footage to the minor domestic activities of the Johnsons. Of course, it is hardly possible to be disgruntled over Mrs. Johnson's heroic stand in front of an enraged rhino (also in front of the camera), but in general the space they devote to photographing each other might have been used more profitably to show how a lion behaves when he is bringing a zebra down.Traveling in two Sikorsky amphibians, the Johnsons covered 60,000 miles in twenty months. They rose to the top of Mount Kenya and obtained some magnificent views of that austere and mighty peak in its wreath of clouds. They roared over veldt and jungle, scattering herds of animals in witless fright. \\"Baboona,\\" in fact, rests its chief claim to novelty on its interesting and sometimes striking scenes of elephants, rhinos, flamingos, giraffes and other wild game as photographed from overhead. The natives, according to the internal evidence of the picture, were not unduly concerned over the sky demons. Apparently this was old stuff to them. In addition, they go in for a good deal of ambitious mugging for the Johnson cameras and in spots resemble nothing so much as a pack of dusky candidates for spear-wielding jobs in a new De Mille picture.There are several scenes of a lion family supping on a dead zebra. A savage warthog engages in a no-decision bout with a leopard and walks off with what the sports writers call the newspaper decision. Then there is the hyena that invades the baboon settlement in search of a suckling babe for his dinner and finds himself confronted by some irate vigilantes of the community. In one of the best episodes in \\"Baboona\\" the baboon clan flees across a stream and sets up a squatter settlement on land inhabited by a tribe of smaller monks, who stage a picturesque and amusing protest rally. Although it does not aspire to be a bombshell of primitive horrors, \\"Baboona\\" possesses the fascination which accompanies the camera when it journeys into remote lands.

When a car travels faster than 50 miles an hour, more than half the energy needed to keep it moving goes to overcome wind resistance, and this proportion grows as the speed increases. There is a rule of thumb in the auto industry that a 10 percent increase in aerodynamic efficiency yields a 3 to 4 percent increase in overall fuel economy.   Such an improvement is all the more attractive since it is essentially free, compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to produce more efficient engines or lighter structures. ''A car's got to have that sheet metal, so I can make a signifigant contribution if I can find a way to bend it more efficiently,'' says Jack Telnack, the chief design executive for the Ford Motor Company's North American operations.

But critics of pop culture usually put the emphasis in the wrong place, thinking in terms of artists, originality and creativity instead of the audience's needs. The wildly cheering sellout crowd for Aerosmith had probably seen the same routine dozens of times before, and it didn't care a bit. There's a clear need, culturally, for some sort of transcendence in entertainment, and the band and its lead singer, Steven Tyler, were there to supply it. In this case, transcendence came in the form of rebellious decadence, decadence being the quickest way to slip out of the 9-to-5 existence.

The villages around the local capital of Jing hong are full of members of various ethnic groups, wearing distinctive bright clothing and speaking their own languages.

Asserting that ''there are two majorities out there'' - the general public, which he believes has spoken through President Reagan's electoral victories, and the legal profession, which he apparently believes exercises unwarranted influence over the development of legal theory and judicial appointment standards - Mr. McDowell acknowledges that ''a judge or justice should be both willing and able to resist both majorities in defense of constitutional principle.''   Mr. McDowell's pique at the bar, which has been sharply critical of the Administration's crabbed reading of the Constitution, is understandable, if somewhat irrelevant to his point. But, sadly, it is unusual these days for a Justice Department representative to even tacitly affirm the vital role of life-tenured judges in our constitutional system - to resist incursions on free speech, privacy, due process, equality and other enduring constitutional values by executives and legislatures that represent temporary political majorities.

The lines used to snake down the corridor and out the door as cookie lovers lined up for the Y's large, warm, soft, chewy version. But the Y, now on G Street Northwest, is no longer so centrally located and it has no baking ovens. The cookie making has been farmed out to someone who guards the recipe as closely as the Y once did. The cookies are still available at the Y and at Neiman-Marcus, but a lot of the ritual's charm has been lost.   The Y cookie also has a lot of competition now. Lovers of chocolate chip cookies now have choices, not only in Washington but all over the country.

Almost everyone is tall and handsome and content. There is no discord here, no killing, for the good king and his men have ''sworn with their life blood that no one should oppress or use his position to treat the other subhumanly.'' For centuries, in fact, Shavi has been at peace - that is, until one day, a bright, birdlike object tumbles out of the sky.

W. de Klerk a mandate to end white rule. By a surprisingly large 2-to-1 margin, they approved a measure endorsing negotiations already under way to create a nonracial, democratic constitution. This result marks a historic turning point for Africa.\\n\\nMany South African conservatives and sympathizers abroad have long argued that democracy cannot succeed on the African continent. They point to the dismal results achieved in the first three decades of the independence era: In country after country democratic constitutions were torn up or ignored. Power was concentrated in the hands of dictators of varying degrees of brutality. Corruption flourished. Economies were destroyed. Civil war and famine became endemic. The litany of horror stories cited by conservatives is often exaggerated. As many Africans have argued, the positive side of the African story is seldom told in the West. Many African leaders have struggled against tremendous odds to find ways to help their people survive and develop. Nevertheless, the conservatives have a point: By almost any measure, the first wave of experiments with democracy in Africa -- beginning with Ghana's independence in 1957 -- failed.

Johnson (1901-1970) ended abruptly in 1947 when he was confined to Central Islip State Hospital on Long Island for a psychiatric disorder. Despondent and withdrawn, he never left the hospital or painted again. Although the art he left behind suggests many shifting states of mind, despondency is seldom one of them. Rather, it gives evidence of an ambitious artist energetically tackling the issues of 20th-century painting between the world wars, and arriving at a style that combined European modernism with a vernacular American content. This approach defines the work of a number of Johnson's contemporaries -- Marsden Hartley, Jacob Lawrence and Stuart Davis, among them -- but it is the way Johnson mixed and weighted those ingredients that gives his art its distinction.   A generous sampling of his work is now on view at the Studio Museum in Harlem and at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The paintings in the Whitney's \\"Homecoming: William H. Johnson and Afro-America, 1938-1946,\\" which originated at the National Museum of American Art in Washington, are the late works on which Johnson's reputation will doubtless stand. The installation does everything possible both to consolidate their modernist credentials and to present them as political documents anticipating today's multi-cultural thinking. It is, however, the exhibition at the Studio Museum, mixing early work with late, that offers a real sense of the jumpy rhythm of Johnson's life and career.

North, a Marine major, is assigned to the National Security Council at the White House.  DECEMBER President Ronald Reagan signs an executive order that authorizes a covert operation by the C.I.A. to support the contras, rebels who are fighting the leftist Government of Nicaragua. The Administration hopes its secret backing will bolster the contras' appearance as an indigenous independent force. 1982  DECEMBER With accounts of U.S. backing leaking out, Congress enacts the Boland Amendment, which bars the use of Federal money to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government. 1984  SPRING Major North is assigned as White House contact with the contras. 1985  FEBRUARY Through dummy corporations abroad, Colonel North and two associates -- Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general, and Albert A. Hakim, an Iranian-American arms dealer -- make the first of six purchases of weapons destined for the contras. The money comes from private contributions, all secret. By keeping the source of the money private, the White House is able to squeeze through a loophole in the Boland Amendment and maintain that this arms supply is legal.  SUMMER News accounts link Colonel North to a private network supplying military aid to the contras. The reports prompt questions from Congress, and Mr. North helps Robert C. McFarlane, the President's national security adviser, prepare a denial.  JULY Israeli Government officials, who long viewed Iran as a counterweight to Iraq and other Arab enemies of Israel, tell Mr. McFarlane that the Iranians want to open a \\"political discourse\\" with Washington. Although the United States publicly views the Teheran Government as terrorist and has outlawed arms sales to it, this overture soon leads to the first shipment of American weapons to Iran, without legal authorization. The shipment, in turn, brought the release of one of seven Americans held hostage in Lebanon by Islamic militants.  NOV. 19 Colonel North is appointed by Mr. McFarlane to handle logistics for a second arms shipment, of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles, to Iran.  1986  APRIL 4 In a memo to John M. Poindexter, who has succeeded Mr. McFarlane as national security adviser, Colonel North proposes diverting to the contras $12 million of the proceeds from the sale to Iran. The memo, Colonel North will later testify, was intended for President Reagan.  MAY 25 Mr. McFarlane, who has formally left the Government but remains a consultant to the White House, flies secretly to Teheran with Colonel North and other officials, carrying spare parts for missiles.  AUG. 6 Meeting with 11 members of the House Intelligence Committee, Colonel North denies raising money for the contras or offering them military advice. As he later testified, this was a lie.  OCT. 5 Carrying arms to the contras, a cargo plane is shot down over Nicaragua. Three crewmen are killed, and a fourth, Eugene Hasenfus, is captured by the Nicaraguan Army.  NOV. 22 Justice Department investigators discover in Colonel North's office his April memo proposing the diversion of arms-sale money to the contras. NOV. 23 Colonel North meets privately with Mr. McFarlane and tells him that the diversion was approved by White House superiors. The colonel also meets with Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and informs him. NOV. 24 Mr. Meese tells the President of the diversion. NOV. 25 Mr. Meese discloses the Iran-contra connection. Mr. Reagan announces Mr. Poindexter's resignation and Colonel North's dismissal.  1987  JAN. 6-7 Special committees of the Senate and the House are created. FEB. 26A Presidential commission led by former Senator John G. Tower blames the President's top advisers for a chaotic environment that, the commission says, led to the Iran-contra affair. The panel says the President was largely out of touch with the operations of the N.S.C.  JULY 7 Appearing before the Congressional committees, Colonel North begins six days of frequently fervent testimony. He says that he does not know if Mr. Reagan was aware of the diversion of arms-sales money to the contras but that William J. Casey, Director of Central Intelligence, had approved it. Mr. Casey had recently died. NOV. 18 The Congressional committees conclude that the President failed to meet his constitutional mandate to \\"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\\" The committees say that he bears \\"ultimate responsibility.  1988  MARCH 11 Mr. McFarlane pleads guilty to four misdemeanor counts of withholding from Congress information about the Administration's efforts to help the contras. He is later sentenced to two years' probation and 200 hours of community service.  MARCH 16 A Federal grand jury indicts Colonel North, Mr. Poindexter, Mr. Secord and Mr. Hakim on an array of charges, among them conspiracy to defraud the Government by providing the contras with funds from Iran.  MARCH 18 Colonel North resigns from the Marine Corps.  1989  JAN. 5 The defense's demands for classified Government documents, and the Government's refusal to provide them, lead to the dropping of two central counts against Mr. North.  MAY 4 Mr. North is convicted of obstructing Congress, destroying documents and accepting an illegal gratuity. He is acquitted of nine counts.  JULY 25 The continuing battle over classified documents leads to the dropping of two of the most serious charges against Mr. Poindexter. NOV. 8 Mr. Secord pleads guilty to one count of making a false statement to Congress. The plea resolves all charges against him.  1990  APRIL 7 Mr. Poindexter is convicted of conspiracy to mislead Congress, obstructing Congressional inquiries and making false statements. JULY 20 A Federal appeals court sets aside the North conviction, ruling that the case may have been tainted by the testimony that Mr. North, under a grant of immunity, had given to the Congressional committees.  1991  JULY 9 Alan D. Fiers, former head of the C.I.A.'s Latin America task force, pleads guilty of withholding from Congress information about the arms-money diversion. He is later sentenced to a year's probation and 100 hours of community service. SEPT. 6 Clair E. George, former chief of covert operations for the C.I.A., is indicted on perjury charges. OCT. 7Elliott L. Abrams, former Assistant Secretary of State, pleads guilty of withholding information from Congress about efforts to aid the contras. He is later sentenced to two years' probation and 100 hours of service.  NOV. 26 Duane R. Clarridge, former chief of operations for the C.I.A., is indicted on perjury charges. 1992  JUNE 16 Former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger is indicted on charges of lying to Congress about his knowledge of the Iran-contra affair. DEC. 9 After one trial in which the jury deadlocked, Mr. George is convicted of lying to Congress. DEC. 24 President George Bush pardons Messrs.

The series, created by Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman, offered strong female characters who were awash in a sea of troubles and who deftly reduced any male in the vicinity to a supporting role. In the first episode, the four Reed sisters reunited to help their mother, Bea (Elizabeth Hoffman), get back on her  feet after the death of their father. The sisters would meet regularly in a steam room to dish and connive and giggle. Initially, the dialogue was edgy, especially as far as Alex (Swoosie Kurtz), the oldest, was concerned.

This is the cheap-fiction riddle put in the new French film, \\"The Mirror Has Two Faces\\" (Le Miroir a Deux Faces), which came to the Baronet yesterday.In some previous Hollywood pictures, this question of what occurs when a woman has her face lifted has been answered conventionally","excerpt":"after a certain amount of adjusting, the girls have made peace with their men.But not in \\"The Mirror Has Two Faces.\\" This being a stubborn French film, and the grotesque caprices of jealousy being nicely regarded in France, the husband kicks up a vicious ruckus, treats his wife as if she has been unfaithful to him and, finally, after spurning her entreaties, attempts to ravish her. Psychological resentments toss and churn within his brain. He's gone, by the end of the picture—meanly and murderously mad.For a complex demonstration of a gent going off his chump for a reason that you'd think would be most joyful and gratifying to a healthy man, this picture provides a full measure. André Cayatte and Gerard Oury have packed their most heady invention into this aspect of the tale. And, under M. Cayatte's fierce direction, the gaunt, whey-faced actor. Bourvil, sputters and explodes with morbid tempers as the unappreciative spouse.Under the circumstances, Mlle. Morgan hasn't a great deal to do, after she has acted the ugly, drudging housewife, but look utterly beautiful and much dismayed. Her portrayal of a piteous wallflower, behind a Cyrano-shaped putty nose, is painfully real and touching. But once she gets out from under the mud and comes back to her bleak suburban family in a new wardrobe as a stunning platinum blonde, she is no longer real. She is just a symbol of the cosmetic trade's ideal. Mlle. Morgan is too fine an actress to be comfortable in this pasteboard role.And, indeed, it appears that M. Cayatte and M. Oury (who, by the way, also acts the plastic surgeon) are so stunned when they have her there they can't think of anything more normal for her to do than elope with another married man. This chap, played by Ivan Desny, is a real soggy, romantic type. He may be more attractive, but Bourvil is more interesting.In the end, the moral of this drama seems to be that nothing much is gained, outside of complete domestic rupture, by putting a new face on things.On parle français ici, with English subtitles.

Such whirlwind success -- the Museum of Modern Art almost immediately snapped up and exhibited the teacup -- proved difficult to handle.

Unable to work for long periods, she finally recovered and, as the intriguing Oppenheim retrospective that opens today at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum makes clear, was still an active artist at the time of her death.

One song from it, ''Breathe Me,'' orchestrated the finale of ''Six Feet Under,'' and it's of a piece with the rest of the album: starting out slow and fragile, with a handful of instruments and a fringe of electronics, as Sia confesses to despair and vulnerability. As the down-tempo tracks subtly fill out, steadying themselves, her voice becomes more determined and resolute yet no less delicate. Sia makes Dido sound complacent and makes Sarah McLachlan sound extravagant. Her songs are full of regrets and uncertainties, but the melodies are all she needs to cling to.    SSM       There are two differences between SSM's ''LP1'' (Shmosz ) and countless garage-rock revivals: the sound is scruffier and the songs are smarter. John Szymanski (keyboards, vocals), Dave Shettler (drums) and Marty Morris (guitar), have been playing garage rock in other Detroit bands","excerpt":"after a month of collaboration, they recorded this album in two days. Unruly analog keyboards and dinky rhythm machines define the sound as much as overloaded fuzz-tone guitar, and the tunes slip free of three-chord orthodoxy. The old garage-rock lust is there, but so are tidings of apocalypse and sardonic opening lines like ''Sorry I never sent no flowers when she overdosed.'' Despite the vintage equipment, this is no 1960's revival; it's a warped reinvention.    Dengue Fever       Yes, California is on the Pacific Rim. Some Los Angeles musicians who became fascinated with 1960's Cambodian rock -- a collision of local music and Armed Forces Radio beaming from Vietnam -- went out and found themselves a transplanted Cambodian pop star, Ch'hom Nimol, and started writing new material with her. The songs on Dengue Fever's album ''Escape From Dragon House'' (M80) reach back to the 1960's of the Doors, the Ventures and the Jefferson Airplane, but with bilingual lyrics and melodies based on Asian scales. In ''One Thousand Tears of a Tarantula,'' complete with dizzy psychedelic echoes and the sudden eruption of a horn section, the whole nutty mix boils over.    Sonic Youth       Arty, amorphous and unrepentant about both: that applies equally to the dizzying, personalized cosmogonies of Stan Brakhage's films and the free-form side of Sonic Youth. There are no songs on ''SYR 6: Koncertas Stan Brakhage Prisiminimui: Muzikos Horizontai'' (SYR), which holds 65 minutes of soundtrack music improvised for a 2003 screening of Brakhage silents. The band, with the percussionist Tim Barnes, delves into sustained, very slowly evolving textures -- tinkling, clanging, echoing, sliding, scraping, feedback, and occasional distorted spoken words -- that become both ominous and engulfing.    Erin McKeown       Airborne metaphors carry the songwriter Erin McKeown all the way through her fourth album, ''We Will Become Like Birds'' (Nettwerk). Her clear mezzo-soprano sounds perpetually optimistic, and so do the syncopated electric guitar parts she picks and plucks through the sparsely arranged but fully realized songs. A degree in ethnomusicology, and African undercurrents, separate her from more rhythmically earthbound folk-rockers. The ballast is lyrics about breakups and aftermaths; her first words on the album are ''I'm in shambles, blown to bits by our troubles.'' Those troubles give her something to rise above.    Lewis Taylor       The English songwriter Lewis Taylor has been recording since the mid-1980's: first as Sheriff Jack and then under his own name. ''Stoned'' (Hacktone/Shout! Factory), an expanded reissue of his 2003 album ''Stoned Part 1,'' is his belated American debut. Recording most of the instruments and voices himself, he's a proud anachronism who's equally fond of 1970's smooth soul and 1960's studio psychedelia while toying with samples, too. He puts his influences -- Brian Wilson, Marvin Gaye, Edgar Winter, the Isley Brothers -- right on the surface. Yet amid the self-conscious borrowings and the suavely infatuated lyrics, he still taps into the benign affection and experimental undercurrents of the era he missed.    Bound Stems       On its densely packed 25-minute EP, ''The Logic of Building the Body Plan'' (Flameshovel), the Chicago band Bound Stems finds plenty of room in a zone that borders Wilco, Animal Collective, Tortoise and the Fiery Furnaces. The songs start out orderly and serene, working in minimalist patterns on a chord or two. But it doesn't take them long to go haywire. Tracks mutate from electronics-smudged skiffle to garage rock to noise, and back; verse-chorus-verse gets discombobulated by psychedelic squall and vertiginous overdubs. And Bobby Gallivan sings, in an unheroic voice, about memories, romance gone wrong and -- strangest of all, given this stubbornly idiosyncratic rock -- commercial ambitions.    Dion       In his hits, Dion DiMucci has been a doo-wopper (''Runaround Sue'') and a sensitive 1960's guy (''Abraham, Martin and John''). Behind them, he reveals this week with the release of ''Bronx in Blue'' (Dimensional Music Recordings), was a grounding in the blues. He comes to the music with fond understanding and vigorous technique, backed by just a drummer as he multitracks his own two acoustic guitars. In material by Robert Johnson, Lightnin' Hopkins, Bo Diddley, Howlin' Wolf and Hank Williams, he's wholehearted and free of affectation. While there have been more haunted versions of these classic songs, Dion doesn't smile through them. He sings like someone whose demons are in the past but still not forgotten.

It has come fairly complete—perhaps more than that—with the dowager and the divorced Browns up to their old tricks. It is a mirthful affair, eight reels (or is it?) of carefree madness. Then there is an ending, a happy ending. Life continues on Long Island . . .The Browns were married for a time and then they were divorced. Kitty sought the expansive atmosphere of Paris and Bob presumably roamed the Island fastnesses. Ultimately they were brought together under the same roof. What happened is obvious—especially when other men were present and other women. But Long Island is like that","excerpt":"after a week-end of dialogue and misunderstanding, there is always a happy conclusion. And a change at Jamaica.As a plot the theme of \\"Let Us Be Gay\\" has been noted by numerous stage contributors since Shakespeare. Young men are always meeting young women—say, of Westchester—when they climb from the white-tiled pools near Babylon. What makes the meeting of the surprised Browns particularly gay is, therefore, not so much that they did as how. And under that heading come, first, the writings of Rachel Crothers and then the acting of Norma Shearer, Marie Dressler, Rod La Rocque and Gilbert Emery. And others.Miss Crothers apparently admits that there's nothing new under the Island sun. She so gives up pretensions and concentrates on characterization. Mrs. Boucicault smoked cigars in the play; she doesn't in the film—for reasons that are obvious, if not good. She still calls loudly, however; she still has her faculty for making deep, sinister remarks; she still denies eccentricity. And so, as an example of Miss Crothers's contribution to the play, she is far above the mere proprietor of the Long Island home in which the Browns meet again.The four main personages noted above are all excellent in their rôles; but if one stands out among the rest it is Miss Dressler—as the dowager. She stamps around her house, argues with the butler, sets her plots, and ultimately is \\"more than subtle\\"—as she claims. She does it all with an expression and an air that is practically Southamptonian. Miss Shearer makes eyes and attaches men's hearts to her sleeve with the most casual of gestures.The ending of \\"Let Us Be Gay\\" is unfortunate. It comes abruptly, and with tears and a manner of \\"I won't do it again.\\" It does not fit in well with what has gone before; it is not in keeping with the characterization. Kitty is one minute laughing at her former husband and the next is agreeing to start all over with him. She, the Long Island Lorelei, the young lady who had been asked by Mrs. Boucicault to rescue her granddaughter from the toils of Bob.
