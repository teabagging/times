Vocally, Ms. Haran recalls Doris Day when she was with Les Brown's band in the 1940's. In her between-song remarks, she suggests a contemporary update of one of Myrna Loy's no-nonsense movie heroines, tinged with Rita Hayworth's seductiveness. Marveling at the early-evening revelries in the Algonquin's lobby, she imagined the scene as \\"a diorama at the Museum of Natural History: ancient urban dwellers' wing.\\"   It is unusual to find a cabaret singer whose sentences have such a chiseled literary precision. But Ms. Haran, who will be at the Oak Room (59 West 44th Street in Manhattan) through April 25, blends an unaffected vocal fluency and sophisticated wit with astonishing ease. An introduction to a suite of 1940's chestnuts by Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke included a pointed critical appreciation of the Bing Crosby-Bob Hope \\"Road\\" movies for which they wrote songs. She also commented on the \\"boyishness\\" of Burke's lyric sensibility, an assessment borne out by her performance of the ingenuous \\"Polka Dots and Moonbeams.\\" Review/Cabaret","excerpt":"1940's Classics to Bossa Nova, With Chitchat"},{"year":"2001","title":"Virginia O'Brien, familiar face and voice in film musicals and comedies of 1940's, dies at age 81 (S) Virginia O'Brien","excerpt":"1940's Film Star, 81"},{"year":"1993","title":"Max Perlow, a labor leader of the 1940's, died on Saturday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx.

The 2,403 Americans who died there were victims not of an ordinary act of war, but of a cowardly shot in the back. Japan, many Americans feel, is morally obliged to accept blame for this dishonorable conduct before the American people can grant historical absolution.

A typical Alekhine game evolved into a three&#8208;ring&#8208;circus in which so much happened so quickly the opponent did not know what to expect next. On the other hand, an opponent of Capablanca was all too often deluded into thinking that nothing was going on until resignation became imminent. Alekhine's conjuring of complications reached its ascendancy after World War II, but the Capablanca style was never outmoded &#8212; it needed only a Bobby Fischer to revive it. Fischer demonstrated the superiority of bishop over nigh knight with pawns on both sides of the board in winning the fourth game of his match with Mark Tananov in Vancouver ni 1971. In the Orense International Tournament, the American grandmaster Arthur Bisguier also took up the cudgel for Capablanca, pulling off a clean victory against Guillermo Estevez of Cuba that was made possible by the superiority of a bishop in free play over one blocked by its own pawns. What Estevez needed was a sharp freeing maneuver in the opening such as 6 P&#8208;KR3; 7. B&#8208;R4, P&#8208;KN4; 8 B&#8208;N3, N&#8208;K5. Instead, his 6 0&#8208;0 led him into a variation of the Queen's Gambit in which his king bishop was misplaced at QN5. With 11 N&#8208;K5, Bisguier was already threatening 12 NxN followed by the breakup of the kingside with 13 BxN, thus forcing the retreat of the black king bishop. Since Bisguier threatened to set up a classical attacking position with 13 Q&#8208;B3 and 14 P&#8208;KN4, Estevez had little choice but to exchange minor pieces with 12 N&#8208;K5.
