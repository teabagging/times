But new graffiti-style advertisements -- done, it must be said, by real-live graffiti artists -- for decidedly above-ground companies like Time Warner, General Motors and Unilever have lately upset that balance. Now it's angry artists who are protesting and even buffing, and marketing experts who are joining in on heated debates about selling out. For the advertisers, of course, (almost) any publicity is welcome. Reports from three new battlegrounds:    HUMMER H3: Shortly after the Tats Cru's murals for this General Motors vehicle began appearing on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the advertising blog adrants.com reported that one had been overwritten with protests like, ''No blood for oil.'' A commenter on the site asked just how authentic street art was ''if it says 'street art' on the ad.''    AXE DEODORANT: In late May, a graffiti-style billboard for Axe men's deodorant by Unilever replaced the usual concert fliers on a boarded-up building in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago. Ed Marszewski, who edits an alternative culture magazine, Lumpen, posted a video clip on Lumpen.com showing his ad hoc band of ''Ad Blasters'' painting over the Axe ad while making the deadpan admonition, ''Any kind of corporate graffiti must be eviscerated.'' Mr. Marszewski wrote of the Axe mural, ''It's not 'graffiti' & it's not art -- the power to inspire vaporizes once the viewer realizes they are simply being targeted as a consumer.'' Steve Lambert, on the Brooklyn-based media site Stay Free! (stayfreemagazine.org), argued that those who live by the street art ethos must be prepared to die by it: ''It seems the Axe ad tried to be a part of the community by being at street level, using graffiti artists, etc., but wasn't respected enough in the community to last.'' The editor of Stay Free!, Carrie McLaren, wrote that when it came to the ad's target demographic, Ad Blasters had done Axe a favor: ''By painting over the billboard, they made it more authentic.''    TIME MAGAZINE: Last month Time commissioned the well-known graffiti artist Cope2 (cope2truelegend.com/) to repeatedly bomb a blank billboard at the corner of Houston and Wooster Streets in SoHo. After several weeks, the magazine's distinctive red border was placed over the accumulated tags. In declaring Time's campaign a success, Marc Schiller, who runs Wooster Collective (woostercollective.com), a leading street-art blog, dismissed the advertising vs. art dichotomy altogether: ''Once something's out there,'' he said, ''what matters is how well it's done.''

A1    The Iraqi police carried out raids, detaining several dozen people suspected of being insurgents, in an effort to find those responsible for a huge suicide car bombing in Hilla last Monday. Residents have crowded the streets to demand better protection and punishment for those responsible.   A12    Hezbollah Applauds Syria  The Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah declared its full support for Syria, presenting a direct challenge to opposition groups after Syria promised to gradually withdraw troops from Lebanon.   A3    Pakistan Renews Qaeda Chase  Pakistani forces have begun operations along the border with Afghanistan, continuing their pursuit of foreign Qaeda fighters into the mountainous tribal area where Osama bin Laden has been thought to be hiding for the last year.   A4    Sudan Not Getting Pledged Aid  The United Nations' top relief official said the world is failing to provide promised aid to the people of southern Sudan, putting at risk a peace agreement that was hailed as a model for resolving ethnic wars afflicting Africa.   A4    Sisters Stand up to the I.R.A.  Five sisters from Belfast, spurred by the brutal killing of their brother, and what is widely seen as a subsequent cover-up, are demanding that the Irish Republican Army stop protecting the attackers -- whose identities are widely known -- and allow witnesses to tell the police their stories so that justice can be done.   A6    Communists Win Moldova Vote  The Communist Party of Moldova, a former Kremlin favorite that has turned Westward in recent years, appeared to have weathered its split with the Russian government. The Party looks likely to maintain the largest bloc in Moldova's Parliament, according to survey of voters leaving the polls at the election.   A3    NATIONAL   A12-14    Influence of Donor Money An Issue for Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California, is pursuing an overhaul of the state's government, which he says needs to be rid of moneyed ''special interests.'' Now, as he is raising record amounts of money for his push, some Democrats and watchdog groups are questioning the influence of money on the governor.   A12    Exploring the Cost of a Deal  Both Democrats and Republicans are exploring the pros and cons of compromising on overhauling Social Security, but the types of deals envisioned by each side remain mostly anathema to the other. Some members in each party believe that no agreement is better than one that gives way on principle.   A13    Lieberman Critics Raise Voice  Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat, has angered some in his party for expressing willingness to work with President Bush to change Social Security -- in addition to supporting the war in Iraq and Mr. Bush's cabinet choices -- prompting some Democrats in Connecticut, his home state, to begin talking about a ''Dump Joe'' effort.   A13    Parties Prepare for Rules Fight  Republicans and Democrats are preparing intently behind the scenes in anticipation of a Senate floor showdown over President Bush's judicial candidates. Members of both parties are combing precedents for a prospective move by Republicans to change rules so that Democrats cannot block votes on federal court nominees.   A14    Mayor Struggles in Re-Election  Several political strategists say James K. Hahn, the mayor of Los Angeles, has squandered the power of the incumbency, allowing the two strongest challengers to catch up in the polls, partly because he failed to take advantage of the peace and prosperity in the city and partly because of his colorless demeanor.   A14    SCIENCE/HEALTH    Pfizer Wants to Sell Heart Drug in Combination  A drug that could be one of the most promising new heart treatments in a decade, called torcetrapib, is generating controversy even before it is approved, because its maker, Pfizer, plans to sell it only to patients also taking the company's best-selling cholesterol treatment, Lipitor. Some say that Pfizer was combining the drugs mainly to protect Lipitor from competition.   A1    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Prosecutors Intervened To Keep Informer in U.S.  Reginald Gousse, a former jailhouse informer and Haitian immigrant charged with impersonating a police officer and killing a Long Island man, was able to avoid deportation last year because of extraordinary interventions by the Queens district attorney's office, state and federal records show.   A1    Gay Civil Union in Connecticut  The debate over a bill that would allow same-sex civil unions in Connecticut is relatively muted, reflecting views that have evolved rapidly in response to historic actions taken in neighboring states, lawmakers and gays activists say.   B5    Mayor Wary of Stadium Bid  Mayor Bloomberg said New Jersey's offer to build a stadium that would be shared by the Jets and the Giants was complicating his plans for a Jets stadium on the West Side of Manhattan.   B2    SPORTSMONDAY   D1-9    Woods Back in No. 1 Slot  Two of golf's premier players, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods, hooked up in the final round of the Doral Open. Mr. Woods, who was five strokes behind after two rounds, set a tournament record at the country club with his 24-under-par 264 victory, and in the process regained his No. 1 world ranking.   D1    ARTS   E1-11    CBGB Battles for Its Home  The Manhattan nightclub CBGB has been battling with its landlord which has been attempting to collect more than $300,000 in back rent from the club since 2001. Although much of that amount has now been paid, the club faces eviction over the remaining debts, and the potential doubling of its rent when the sublease comes up for renewal in August.   E3    Novelists Address 9/11  After three years of near silence about the attacks of Sept. 11, the literary world has begun to grapple with the meanings and consequences of the worst terrorist attack ever to happen on American soil as it prepares to release a half-doezn novels that use 9/11 and its aftermath as central elements of their plot or setting.   E1    BUSINESS DAY   C1-10    Sony Names Foreigner C.E.O.  The board of the Sony Corporation of Japan in Tokyo has named Sir Howard Stringer its chairman and chief executive, a rare instance of a leading Japanese company turning to a foreigner to fill a top position, executives close to the board said.   A1    BAE to Acquire United Defense  BAE Systems, the British military company, reached a deal to acquire United Defense Industries, which made the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, for about $4 billion, according to executives close to the deal.   A14    Vulnerability on EBay  EBay's domination of the online auction business and its heavy dependence on e-mail communication make its users particularly vulnerable to online scams with some facing problems with phishing, a type of online fraud that collects victims' account passwords and other information.

Mr. Zhang might then have joined Mao and become a hero of the revolution that eventually prevailed, but he chose instead to accept Chiang's judgment -- a lifetime of house arrest which ended only recently -- and became a symbol of patriotism for Nationalists and Communists alike. Now almost 90 years old, Mr. Zhang, in his first interview at home, said that after 50 years of isolation he is uncomfortable as an object of reverence. \\"I can't take everybody's compliments,\\" he said.

Mr. Rosenberg, Mr. Herzstein writes, \\"was not a witness to Ivan's death, nor had he claimed to be.\\" Well, that all depends on which of Mr. Rosenberg's contradictory sworn statements you want to believe.   In December 1945 and December 1947, Mr. Rosenberg made statements about his wartime experience for the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw and the Jewish Documentation Center in Vienna. In the 1947 statement, Ukrainian Weekly quotes Mr. Rosenberg as saying, of the August 1943 uprising at Treblinka, \\"Afterwards, we broke into Ivan's machine room. He was asleep at the time. Gustav hit him in the head with a spade, leaving him lying there for all eternity.\\"   Ed Nishnic, Mr. Demjanjuk's son-in-law, located in Warsaw another 1947 statement by Mr. Rosenberg, suggesting that he killed Ivan or participated in the killing: \\"Then I  [ or we ]  smacked Ivan over the head, behind the ear, so that he lay there, dead.\\" (The statement, in Yiddish, is unclear whether the word he wrote was \\"I\\" or \\"we.\\")   As Jim McDonald, chief investigator for the defense, writes in \\"John Demjanjuk: The Real Story\\": \\"Rosenberg made and signed this obviously exculpatory 1947 statement and admitted at the Demjanjuk trial that he had signed each of the eight pages of the deposition that detailed the assassination of Ivan by the inmates. Subsequently, he hedged his testimony by stating that the 'murder of Ivan was based on what other inmates had told him in the forest after the breakout.' \\"   There is other information in Mr. McDonald's splendid slim book, relevant to the credibility of the prosecution's \\"star\\" witness.   Mr. Rosenberg claimed in Jerusalem to have entered Israel on Rosh ha-Shanah, 1942 (impossible if he were at Treblinka)","excerpt":"claimed to have seen 300 to 400 people stuffed into a tiny gas chamber, 12 by 12 feet; claimed to have thrown bodies into an \\"incinerator\\" at Treblinka, though there was no incinerator, only one burning pit. Most startlingly, he claimed in Jerusalem to have dragged the remains of his two sisters from a gas chamber, a horrific experience that was inexplicably never mentioned in his postwar statements. (In 1987, Mr. Rosenberg reportedly said he had dragged the bodies of his three daughters out of a gas chamber in September 1942, even though he was only 17 1/2 years old at that time.)   Mr. Herzstein relates Mr. Rosenberg's dramatic words after identifying Mr. Demjanjuk at the Jerusalem trial: \\"This is Ivan. I say so unhesitatingly and without the slightest doubt. Ivan from Treblinka -- from the gas chambers.\\" Yet, when first shown John Demjanjuk's    wartime    picture in 1976, Mr. Rosenberg had said, \\"I refuse to say that I can identify him with certainty.\\" Certitude came later.   In Jerusalem, Mr. Rosenberg and the other star witness, Pinhas Epstein, contradicted each other repeatedly. Mr. Epstein claimed that bodies were burned only during the day, whereas Mr. Rosenberg insisted that bodies were burned night and day; one said prisoner assembly occurred only at night, the other that it took place morning and night. They disagreed on whether the diesel engine was run by Fritz Schmidt or someone called Szlamek. Mr. Epstein described as virtual identical twins two German guards Mr. Rosenberg testified did not remotely resemble each other. And why, one wonders, did Mr. Rosenberg adamantly refuse to corroborate any feature of the large Treblinka map?   In 1964, a German prosecutor in Dusseldorf, hearing Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Epstein tell their tales of Treblinka, threw the testimony of the pair of them out of court, declaring they \\"lied like hell.\\" A quarter-century later, such testimony would be accepted as sufficient to send an innocent man, John Demjanjuk, to the same gallows as Adolf Eichmann.   One day, not too distant, when the Polish and Soviet archives on Treblinka are pried open, Americans and Israelis will say: But, we did not know. But, they did know. PATRICK J. BUCHANAN  McLean, Va.   Robert Edwin Herzstein replies:     Patrick J. Buchanan is a lively and provocative television personality, and I usually enjoy his performances. In his crusade on behalf of John Demjanjuk, however, Mr. Buchanan has ignored the documentation while quoting biased or questionable secondary sources.   Mr. Buchanan argues that Eliahu Rosenberg made certain postwar comments about having witnessed the death of Ivan the Terrible at Treblinka. Mr. Buchanan does not quote an affidavit or a deposition, but instead quotes a little-known paper called Ukrainian Weekly. Passing up a second chance to cite the original documents, Mr. Buchanan quotes Mr. Demjanjuk's relative, who is allegedly citing Mr. Rosenberg.   Mr. Buchanan then undermines his own quotation by telling us that Mr. Rosenberg's Yiddish statement is unclear on a key point: did Mr. Rosenberg mean \\"I\\" or \\"we\\" when he described the revolt in Treblinka on Aug. 2, 1943? Rejecting a third chance to look at the documents, Mr. Buchanan quotes a Demjanjuk defense operative whose comments actually appear to support Mr. Rosenberg's trial testimony.   In fact, Mr. Rosenberg was in Camp No. 2, while the Jews who killed the Ukrainian guards were from Camp No. 1. He could hardly have witnessed the alleged murder of Ivan. Nor did Mr. Rosenberg see the wartime picture of Ivan in 1976 (it was only published in facsimile late in 1977). He examined Mr. Demjanjuk's 1951 photograph and said, without prompting, that he thought this man looked very much like Ivan from Treblinka. Mr. Rosenberg had known Ivan eight or nine years earlier.   Memory, of course, is held hostage by time. Yet the suppression of memory due to trauma is sometimes overcome when an individual, in a court of law, has to confront a horrible past. If all the witnesses had come up with the same story -- which Mr. Buchanan seems to expect should have happened -- then their story would be suspect.   Mr. Buchanan dismisses the Rosenberg-Epstein testimony at the Treblinka trial, held in Dusseldorf in 1964-65. Yet he does not mention the verdict read by the German court: the three main defendants, including the last commandant of the camp, were sentenced to life imprisonment.   Mr. Buchanan refers only to Mr. Epstein and Mr. Rosenberg among the survivors. Equally important were the statements or testimony of Josef Czarny, Yehiel Reichman, Eugen Turovsky and Avraham Goldfarb, not to mention the statement of the SS nurse Otto Horn, who once identified Mr. Demjanjuk as \\"Ivan from the gas chambers.\\" Nor does Mr. Buchanan note that a Soviet citizen identified Mr. Demjanjuk as a fellow guard at the Sobibor death camp who killed Jews there.   At one time, people harboring Mr. Buchanan's beliefs snarled at any Nazi document produced by the Soviets. No longer. Mr. Buchanan, who avoids citing known and accepted documents, fantasizes about unknown documents in Poland and Russia, whose publication depends entirely upon Communist-maintained archives (whose personnel remain largely unpurged).   Show me the documents, Mr. Buchanan, and I will be happy to re-examine my views. Of course, we do have one Soviet-supplied document, a card from Trawniki, the SS training camp, that places Mr. Demjanjuk, a guard, in Sobibor in 1943. Yet Mr. Buchanan sneered at this document in 1987.   In his comment \\"But, they did know,\\" Mr. Buchanan seems to be making a serious accusation, which he does not spell out. One wonders who \\"they\\" are. One must conclude that Mr. Buchanan believes that the Israeli court, the United States Justice Department and an American Federal judge \\"did know\\" that Mr. Demjanjuk was innocent.   We are all free to question evidence and to doubt the verdict, with one caveat. Enthusiasm expended on behalf of convicted Holocaust perpetrators does not excuse a commentator from applying the canons of scholarly inquiry to their cases.
