Supertitles are a childishly didactic insult to the literate opera audience, we read. They subvert any motivation to prepare oneself properly for the operatic experience. They absolve the singer of the need to articulate the text. They destroy the moment-by-moment, word-to-note correlation of musical drama.   Most of these arguments seem specious at best and suspicious at worst, the feeble protests of translators suddenly threatened with a reduction in employment. True, when the first title flashes onto the screen one does feel momentarily insulted, as if one had wandered into some ritualized lecture-demonstration about opera rather than to an opera itself. But that soon passes, and the advantages are obvious - supertitles allow singers to sing in the original, which preserves the vocal sounds the composer imagined","excerpt":"they let the singer sing anywhere in the world; they genuinely contribute to a deepening of the operatic experience by making a better connection between music and drama than would be otherwise possible, and in so doing they demystify opera in the best and most democratic way.

Will ammonia kill ants? A. According to tests performed by the Agriculture Department, a solution of ammonia and water will only kill limited numbers of ants, temporarily driving away their nests, which eventually return. Ammonia has no long-term effect, said Dr. Clifford Lofgren, a research entomologist with the department. ''People are often fooled by what happens","excerpt":"they look at the nest and see they have killed a portion of the ants and think they have rid themselves of the problem,'' he said. ''What actually happens is that the ants have moved elsewhere because of the ammonia fumes.'' The most effective way to eliminate ants, Dr. Lofgren said, is to kill the queen ant. In his experiments with fire ants, Dr. Lofgren mixed a food attractor, soybean oil, with a toxic chemical, amdro, and set the mixture out as bait. Worker ants discovered the bait and placed it in their crops, parts of the digestive tract in which food is stored. When the worker ants returned to the nest, they regurgitated the bait and fed it to the rest of the insects. The bait was eventually fed to the queen ant, and the toxic amdro annihilated the nest. Q. Are lie detector tests scientific? A. A lie detector, or polygraph, indicates physical changes that occur in response to questions. These changes include alterations in blood pressure, pulse rate and respiration that may occur when a person lies. The polygraph records these changes by drawing lines on a moving graph.

But outside the music itself, the jazz community has always verged on anarchy. For all its art and intelligence, jazz has been caught between the pop-music business, where it rarely makes large profits, and the highbrow music world, where it has never been accorded the prestige of European classical music. Lately, the jazz community - that web of musicians and fans and institutions and entrepreneurs, who don't often speak one another's language - has begun to see itself as one embattled entity rather than a slew of competing factions. And 1985 may just turn out to be the year the anarchy gets organized.   ''There's a lot more cooperation among musicians and organizations,'' says James Browne, an announcer on the 24-hour jazz radio station, WBGO (88.3 FM). ''And the audience is definitely growing.

''Off-duty retired cops show ID, drink for free -- they do it once a month,'' George explains. Satisfied, the customer downs a vodka, drops off the mail and heads off into the streets.

Its faults are many, for its lighting is peculiarly old-fashioned, its acting is staccato and its incidents are worked out in a singularly serio-comic style. But it has the redeeming virtue of possessing the courage of its convictions and of romping through the narrative without imitating other productions or producers. For this reason it is more entertaining than tedious, for it is preferable to perceive Taras, the plump Cossack, quite clumsy and sometimes clownish in the manipulation of his sword, than to see him attempt to be a d'Artagnan.In this production there are several spectacular scenes, and while one may criticize the players, it is nevertheless obvious that in a number of passages they demonstrate that they know how to act. Sometimes they may be left at the post and start the good work late, while on other occasions they are too insistent, too zealous.There is in this story of the Cossacks and the Poles some excellent atmosphere. This is fashioned far more successfully than many a producer might do it nowadays. You obtain a deep impression of the Cossack, with his queerly shorn and sometimes circular hair-cut. Here they are not arrayed in cartridge cases, belted ulsters and astrachan hats","excerpt":"they look more like gypsies or bandits.The film is based on N. V. Gogol's novel, and it was directed by J.

There is the siege of the City of Dubno, the love of a beautiful lady by a Cossack who, eventually, becomes her shining knight despite the fact that his father, the pipe-smoking and extremely confident Taras, and hss brother are outside the city uttering oaths of vengeance.There are a couple of hangings in this film, and it does seem that the characters are a stiff-necked lot. Even old Taras is slung up, and after he has been cut down he is more concerned about his pipe than his backbone.

Here, under the shadow of the desert cliffs in which they worked, lived the elite community of skilled craftsmen - stone quarrymen, masons, sculptors, draftsmen, painters and wood carvers - who built the great tombs of the kings. Generation after generation of these villagers left behind a record of daily life in their ubiquitous graffiti and in the meticulous records of their scribes.  In ANCIENT LIVES: Daily Life in Egypt of the Pharaohs (Holt, $18.95) , John Romer, who spent 15 years as an archeologist in Egypt, re-creates in rich, sensory detail the rhythms and textures of ordinary life in an extraordinary time and place. We learn what the villagers' houses were like, what they ate and wore, what they dreamt about (there is even a remedy for frightening dreams - a recitation ''accompanied by the eating of fresh bread and green herbs moistened with beer''). We hear of the frantic speed with which quarrymen and artists, working in shifts, prepared a tomb for a royal burial, of feuds between foremen and of workers' strikes when food rations, which had to be brought to the isolated village from across the Nile, were delayed. Some readers may be put off by the dense accumulation of archeological detail. But for those who stay with it, this book has rewards. Mr. Romer can make you feel ''the silence of the desert hissing in the evening air,'' hear the chink of the grave robber's chisel and see artists at work in dark, cavernous chambers lit by flickering oil lamps.

Franklin's son, also called Paul, is engaged to marry Bockner's daughter, Norma. It is during a dinner in his honor that Franklin castigates the officials for stirring up race hatred and religious intolerance. This infuriates Bockner and other officials, who shortly afterward send uniformed men to the Franklin World News Association offices to take the books out of the library and burn them.Later General Bockner and others arrive at the Franklin home to insist on a public apology from Franklin for his dinner speech. The picture then is concerned with Franklin's plea to make them see the error of their ways. While he is talking the screen reveals glimpses of many rather worn film scenes. There is the prehistoric man. Eventually one perceives Moses, Buddha, Confucius, Julius Caesar, Christ, Mohammed, Christopher Columbus, George Washington, Napoleon and Lincoln.In course of time, Franklin expatiates upon the World War, wherein he suffered an injury which necessitated his wearing a plate on his skull. He continues his talk outside the house and one of the mob hurls a missile at Franklin, who falls mortally wounded.But apparently his last words cause General Bockner to relent, for that official apparently pretends that he sees things in a different light.Mr. Farnum cannot be said to give an effective portrayal. His acting is a little too much like that in the films of the distant past. Anita Louise lends a certain sincerity to the rôle of Norma and Leroy Mason does what he is able with the part of young Franklin.

Let them please every one, if possible—the simple and the sophisticated, the gay and the gloomy, the young and the old—but let them in the end, and above all, give moral offence to no one. They may go far from the Puritanical path","excerpt":"they may roam freely 'mid pleasures and palaces, but, at the final fade-out, let them return to the humble home and declare that, no matter what the hero and heroine may have done, no matter how natural and right their conduct may have seemed to the younger generation of egoists and social free-thinkers, the ways and ideas of the older generation of conventional moralists are the best. And so, while the sons and daughters have something to approve, the mothers and fathers have nothing to condemn. Thus all are satisfied, if they take the pictures at their face value.Something like this must have been in the minds of the makers of \\"Hairpins,\\" the photoplay at the Rialto this week. It begins with Muriel Rossmore (Enid Bennett) and her husband, Rex (Matt Moore), in their home. Muriel is dowdy. She slops around the house in a kimono, with a trail of hairpins behind her. Rex is a rising young lawyer who likes to go out in the evening. He wishes he had a smart young wife to go with him, but, as he hasn't, he takes his stenographer. So far sympathy is with him. No wife has a right to be a sloven. The younger generation surely approves of Rex's interest in the stenographer, while the older generation waits, knowing well what's coming in the end. Muriel learns of her husband's affair and the reason for it. So she reforms—that is, she gets advice from a \\"woman of the world,\\" buys a new wardrobe, fixes up her hair, learns to smoke and joins a crowd of gay revellers. She will win her husband back by being smart. And again the younger generation approves. Undoubtedly, that's the way to do it. But the older generation waits for the end.Rex is horrified to learn what Muriel is doing. He goes to one of her parties, and in the middle of it notifies her sternly that she is \\"going home—now!\\" At home everything is explained, Rex understands, and Muriel is happy. But is she thereafter to be the kind of wife her husband had desired, his smart companion, out evenings? Not at all. That would offend the moralists. It would have exceedingly questionable means justified by an undoubtedly happy end. It would give the younger generation a chance to turn on their elders and say, \\"You see; there, now\\"—and the elders, who also patronize the movies, would sternly disapprove. So, the younger ones naving had their inning, the elders are now allowed to score. Rex and Muriel realize the error of their ways, decide that home life is the best, after all, and when Rex says, \\"I love you for yourself alone—and I'll buy you an expensive kimono,\\" Muriel smiles angelically. They are happy—and the conventions have been upheld. Logis adapts itself to the individual.\\"Hairpins\\" is an ince picture directed by Fred Niblo, from a scenario by C. Gardner Sullivan. Therefore, it contains many well-made scenes and is interesting in separate parts. Enid Bennett is attractive in any rôle, and as convincing in Muriel's as the story and too much makeup permit. William Conklin, as the heroine's instructor in \\"smartness,\\" is the most genuine person in the story, though there can be no complaint of the acting of Matt Moore, Aggie Herring and most of the others in the cast. All of which means that \\"Hairpins,\\" if it had been bold enough to assert positively and consistently that the conventional moralists are right, or that they are wrong, could have been an entirely enjoyable production.The Rialto program also includes \\"The Enchanted Valley,\\" a scenic, and \\"An Overall Hero,\\" a comedy saved over from last week's bill at the Rivoli.\\"The Jack-Knife Man,\\" for which King Vidor is responsible, is at the Strand this week. Mr. Vidor, whose work has been knocking at Broadway doors for some time, is a cinematician of ability and promise. A number of the scenes in \\"The Jack-Knife Man,\\" which is adapted from a story by Ellis Parker Butler, are examples of excellent direction, and the setting of the story as a whole has been carefully and intelligently arranged.

Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d had been meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. The moment Mr. Tagler heard Mr. Baker say on television, \\"Regrettably . . . ,\\" the trader was on the phone to the commodity pit. Buy orders had pushed the price to $31 -- the quickest rise he had ever seen. Economists are somewhat more stable in their sentiments, occasionally holding them for a whole week. Their consensus by the weekend was that if the United States fights and wins quickly and tidily, oil prices would fall and the economy would benefit. \\"I understand the mood swings, but people are exaggerating,\\" said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns. \\"There is a worldwide glut of oil against a backdrop of weak demand.\\" But if there is a protracted war, many economists say, the budget deficit would widen, and oil prices and interest rates would rise. \\"The uncertainty will have a debilitating effect,\\" said Richard B. Berner, a Salomon Brothers economist. \\"People will hold back from making long-term commitments.\\" Even a last-minute settlement will not be enough to overcome recession, economists say, since growth was slowing before Iraqi troops set foot in Kuwait. Again, Sweat Doesn't Pay  Will the returns on labor rebound and surpass the returns on wealth in the 1990's? From 1984 to 1988, the wealthiest gained in net worth, while everyone else stagnated, the Census Bureau reported last week. The less affluent depend mostly on their wages, which in the 1980's barely kept pace with inflation. Stocks and bonds, meanwhile, enjoyed strong returns. Lacy H. Hunt, chief United States economist for the Hongkong Bank Group, doubts that investments will continue soaring. But wages will rise as labor supplies tighten, he says. \\"The headlines of one decade go into the trash bin of the new decade,\\" he said. For investors, \\"The decade hasn't started off very well, has it?\\" Wholesale Comfort  The wholesale inflation news for December was comforting at every stop in the production chain.

Lincoln Center has launched a jazz department with a $1 million annual budget. The marketing problem for Rob Gibson, the department's chief: How to create an uptown audience, week after week, for music usually heard in downtown clubs. His answers include children's concerts, master classes and small, informal theaters in the center. One possibility is a tribute to Sun Ra, the band leader whose fans can verify his claimed birth in outer space. But judging by what works best at Lincoln Center, Mr. Gibson might better raise his top ticket prices to $115, require black tie on opening nights and drag dozens of shield-bearing supernumeraries on stage. Banking Forecast: Rain  At times last week, L. William Seidman's spirits improved to merely gloomy. Otherwise, he was downright dismal. On Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation warned the Senate Banking Committee that more major bank failures were likely if the recession persists past mid-year. On Friday, he landed in Boston, like a governor visiting a hurricane disaster zone, to say that the region needs more widely available bank credit to free itself from a recession. \\"I don't think there's probably a bad loan being made in New England at this time,\\" he said. \\"Unfortunately, there aren't many others either.\\" INTERNATIONAL   A Payoff for Turkey?  One possible winner in the Middle East crisis: Turkey, which right after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait cut off Iraqi oil pipelines and made military bases available to counter Iraq. Turkey hopes the United States and its allies will offer more help in its continuing disputes with Greece. And Turkey can look forward to closer economic ties with Europe's wealthier nations, said Robert G. Neumann, director of Middle East programs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Turkey needs aid to improve its infrastructure -- the phone lines are too feeble to carry faxes abroad, for example -- if it hopes to capitalize on its low labor costs. Although the European Community is considering several applications for admission, Mr. Neumann said, \\"Turkey may very well move up in the line.\\" With luck, Turkey might prove that it can approach the prosperity of the West.   Oil Importers Prepare for War  The International Energy Agency, representing 21 oil-importing nations, agreed on Friday to release 2 million barrels a day from reserves in case of war in the Middle East. The United States, the largest oil importer, cut petroleum consumption 2.1 percent in 1990, the first drop in seven years. Domestic oil production fell to the lowest level since 1961.

The marketing problem for Rob Gibson, the department's chief: How to create an uptown audience, week after week, for music usually heard in downtown clubs. His answers include children's concerts, master classes and small, informal theaters in the center. One possibility is a tribute to Sun Ra, the band leader whose fans can verify his claimed birth in outer space. But judging by what works best at Lincoln Center, Mr. Gibson might better raise his top ticket prices to $115, require black tie on opening nights and drag dozens of shield-bearing supernumeraries on stage. Banking Forecast: Rain  At times last week, L. William Seidman's spirits improved to merely gloomy. Otherwise, he was downright dismal. On Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation warned the Senate Banking Committee that more major bank failures were likely if the recession persists past mid-year. On Friday, he landed in Boston, like a governor visiting a hurricane disaster zone, to say that the region needs more widely available bank credit to free itself from a recession. \\"I don't think there's probably a bad loan being made in New England at this time,\\" he said. \\"Unfortunately, there aren't many others either.\\"   Business Diary/December 6-11"},{"year":"1961","title":"Pres Kennedy and Prime Min Macmillan, in Bermuda conf, get experts rept that USSR has made progress toward anti-missile missile KENNEDY REVIEWS SOVIET ATOM GAIN WITH MACMILLAN","excerpt":"They Open Bermuda Talks in Accord on Berlin and Congo -- Hear Experts KENNEDY BEGINS MACMILLAN TALKS"},{"year":"1975","title":"Old grandmasters don't fade away&#8212","excerpt":"they open chess clubs.

And the leisure hours of 30 years spent reading at random in that book will put one in touch with more of the product of genius than can be found in any other book of criticism. The literary historian George Saintsbury thought Coleridge's only equals were Aristotle and Longinus, the author of the Greek treatise, ''On the Sublime.''   Much of Coleridge's criticism is found in lectures, and they are fine reading. But ''Biographia Literaria: Biographical Sketches of My Literary Life and Opinions'' is the masterpiece. It is also one of the most disorderly books in any language - a ruin but a magnificent one.

It's the one clever conceit of this first novel by Maggie Paley - a former editor at Life, the Paris Review and The Saturday Evening Post -that the entire narrative takes place on the phone; everything else happens off stage. What we read - or overhear - are the conversations between four inveterate telephone users: Violet, an over-sexed publicist, who's trying to choose between her devoted boyfriend and a hunky, not-so-bright movie star; Helena, a book publisher's somewhat prissy wife, who's having trouble conceiving; Alexandra, a radio talk-show personality, who's carrying on less than fulfilling affairs with an Italian playboy and a ''human potential'' expert, and Kitty, an ambtious entrepeneur who's vying with Alexandra for the attentions of the same men.

Two commercial firms higher in the Government contracting chain had added almost a million dollars in markups.  ''All they did,'' said a middle- level Pentagon official who asked to remain anonymous, ''was place an order for the Air Force","excerpt":"they performed no real function.'' Moreover, there is little likelihood that even the original manufacturer's price was realistic, according to this manager.  Not all officials insist on anonymity. A. Ernest Fitzgerald, a high- ranking civil servant and famous whistleblower in the Air Force, said that recent scandals about grossly inflated spare-part prices had been valuable because they involved simple items about which common-sensical members of the public, or Congress, could not be fooled. A $269 wrench, three inches long, or a $900 plastic cup to place under the leg of a flight navigator's stool are obviously absurd, he said.  ''The horrible truth, however, is that everything is priced about the same way,'' he said. ''The rip-off of taxpayers on the big items - weapons, engines, aircraft - is as bad as on spares.'' In interviews, five experienced Defense Department auditors expressed the belief that it would be possible to save as much as half of the $84.4 billion set aside in the next Defense budget for procurement, plus more money on other parts of the total $247 billion military spending bill.

Earlier this year the trustees of Princeton distributed to the university library and the press $4 million that had been set aside for Bollingen books and reserved $1.8 million of the Bollingen fund to complete the 51 volumes now in the works. William McGuire, managing editor of the series, says he expects the last book to appear in 1988.

Who except for people probably too old to remember would have thought the Indians could ever have a better record than the Yankees? And not just a better record, but a record 16 1/2 games better.   It has happened on occasion, but maybe about as often as Halley's comet makes an appearance. In the Yankees' 22 years under the ownership of George Steinbrenner, to use a time frame related to the Cleveland native, the Indians have reached the 100-game mark of the season with a better record only three times -- in 1989 and '90, and way back in 1974.   There were seasons, on the other hand, when after 100 games, the Yankees were 25 games better than the Indians, 23 games, 20 better.   In August 1995, though, the games-behind number that counts is not the fantasy number with the Indians, but the one with the Boston Red Sox, who still play in the same division with the Yankees. The Red Sox ran off with their eighth consecutive victory last night while the Yankees lost both games to the Indians. The American League East standing now reads:               W-L   GB       Boston   57-39   --       New York   49-47   8          Not even Darryl Strawberry's first home run as a recovering member of the ailing Yankees could keep the number from inflating. The drive off the facade of the third tier of the right field stands helped give the Yankees a 2-1 lead in the second game, but like the first game, they couldn't hold it and lost, 5-2.   \\"They seemed to get up for us and play us well,\\" Willie Randolph said. The Yankees' second baseman-turned-coach, though, was not talking about these Indians. He was recalling the Cleveland teams he played against.    \\"I remember we used to go there, they were pretty much holding the league up and they had promotions like 'Beat the Yankees Hankie' night,\\" Randolph said. \\"Wherever they were in the standings, they seemed to rise another level. They'd get a kick out of beating us. It wasn't a typical rivalry thing, but they just seemed to be a thorn in your side.\\"   For seven seasons, 1979 through 1985, Mike Hargrove was one of the pillars that helped the Indians hold up the league.   \\"The teams I played on never had a chance to win,\\" said Hargrove, now the Indians' manager. \\"I can remember the Yankees coming into Cleveland and there were more Yankee fans than Cleveland fans. Thurman lived in the Akron-Canton area. There were a lot and still are a lot of Yankee fans who come from Buffalo. There were so many of those fans in the stands. It was a little unsettling and it kind of rankled a little bit. But it was always fun to play the Yankees because they had guys like Reggie who played the game hard and played it well.\\"   The Indians hold a prominent place on the last-time list. The last time they finished first was in 1954.   \\"It was frustrating at times,\\" Hargrove related of his playing days, \\"because there were things you knew could be done but we never had the complete package to get it done. You could see if you had another player, or two or three -- and at times it was much more than that -- it would have made a world of difference to put that part of the puzzle in it.\\"   The Indians came to Yankee Stadium with as complete a package as the major leagues have today. Through the slow but steady and astute construction engineered by General Manager John Hart, the Indians have reached a plateau that would make their 1954 ancestors proud.   They have the best record in the majors, the best hitting team and best pitching staff in the A.L. This is the size of the task the Yankees face in this five-game series, overcoming the offensive brigade of Manny Ramirez, Kenny Lofton, Albert Belle, Carlos Baerga, Jim Thome, Eddie Murray and Sandy Alomar Jr., plus the pitching platoon led by Dennis Martinez, Charles Nagy, Orel Hershiser and Jose Mesa.   The first taste of the awesome Indians was distasteful. On the strength of three home runs and seven runs batted in by Mike Stanley in three consecutive times at bat, the Yankees took a 9-5 lead into the ninth inning of the first game. But the Indians exploded for five more runs, scoring all five after John Wetteland entered the game, and won the opener, 10-9.   Alomar doubled home the first run, Lofton tripled across the next two, Baerga singled in the tying run and Thome delivered the winner with a sacrifice fly.   \\"I don't think I remember seeing one team having a good solid young player at every position,\\" Randolph said. \\"And these kids play","excerpt":"they play hard and aggressive. They keep coming at you. It's almost like a friendly competition between themselves.\\"   Their relentless play has particularly impressed Randolph.   \\"With a young team,\\" he said, \\"sometimes it's easy to lay back and fall off when you have a big lead. You're not used to maintaining that certain edge, that mental aspect.\\"   Hart collected the talent; Hargrove and his coaches have the assignment of making sure it reaches its destination.   \\"I've had a lot of questions the last couple of weeks about when the playoffs start, are you going to do this and that,\\" Hargrove said. \\"I hesitate to talk about that because nobody's written us a letter guaranteeing us we're going to be in the playoffs. Until that happens, we have to pay attention to business, keep our focus on what we're doing. We've talked about focus, not letting the outside detract us from what we're trying to accomplish. It keeps us from getting complacent or coasting.\\"   Their fans help, too. No longer do fans of the visiting team outnumber Indians fans. And Indians fans pop up in the strangest places.   \\"We were in Chicago,\\" Hargrove related, \\"and one of our guys hit a home run in the first inning. A roar went up from the stands. It's been neat. We had a lot of fans in Anaheim, a lot in Oakland. It really has been fun to watch the reaction.\\"   Holding such a huge lead on the Yankees, even if it doesn't count, makes the fun even merrier.

In both the songs and the between-song dialogue, the Pea Pickers focused on the plight of coal miners. The lyrics, sung by the banjo player Burl Rhea, described bad conditions inside the mines and the effect it has on the human spirit. \\"Ain't gonna run no coal,\\" he sang in a tune about a 1978 workers' strike. The music was ragged, raw and prickly with plucked strings and sawing fiddle; Mr. Rhea's voice was a lonesome, clotted wail, and he explained that his life in the mines had taken its toll on his lungs.

The Victorian theater returned the compliment by dramatizing his novels, frequently without his consent and even before the book in question had completed its first appearance as a magazine serial.

That threat, which will be the subject of a hearing tomorrow, grew out of his annoyance at an inaccurate news report by a Los Angeles television station, not the actual courtroom coverage. On calm consideration it may occur to the judge that punishing courtroom television for the doings of a local station would be like jailing a felon's blameless cousin who happens to be within reach: guilt by relationship or accessibility.   As friends of courtroom coverage, including The New York Times editorial page, have pointed out, it is a form of television least susceptible to distortion. But critics, including Max Frankel, once the head of that editorial page and later executive editor of the newspaper, and now a columnist for The New York Times Magazine, find such reasoning superficial. They see the television camera not as an extension of the press but as a new sort of monster with the ability to cloud viewers' minds. \\"Images on a screen,\\" Mr. Frankel wrote, \\"draw us into the action","excerpt":"they pound the emotions, bypass the mind.\\" Judge Ito, Spare That Camera"},{"year":"1928","title":"Congratulates Sec Hoover on his nomination for Pres HOOVER GETS FLOOD OF FELICITATIONS","excerpt":"They Pour In From Diplomats, Politicians, Engineers and Business Men.

What these labels actually mean is a prickly question. A friend in publishing argues that the distinguishing mark of fantasy is the presence of magic. But what counts as magic? No less an authority than Arthur C. Clarke has observed -- in a dictum known to his legions of fans as Clarke's Third Law -- that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.     I was reminded of this while reading SUNSTORM: A Time Odyssey: 2 (Del Rey/Ballantine, $25.95), a highly satisfying collaboration between Clarke and Stephen Baxter. At the age of 87, Clarke continues to publish with the help of younger writers like Baxter, whose finest solo work (like his ambitious novel ''Evolution'') owes much to Clarke's patented blend of scientific rigor and speculative daring. ''Sunstorm'' is a sequel of sorts to last year's ''Time's Eye,'' in which awesomely advanced aliens ransacked human history for representative characters like Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan, then dumped them on a patchwork planet to fight it out for dominance. Now we learn that this cruel experiment was prologue to an even crueler intervention: the cleansing of life on earth in the name of some universal greater good.

We wait on tables in exchange for remission of tuition, room and board, the fee for which totals $1,525 and is reduced in increments according to Bread Loaf's fabled hierarchy. Those who \\"have had original work published in periodicals, such as The Georgia Review, Hudson Review, The Atlantic Monthly, Washington Post, The New York Times, Ploughshares, etc.,\\" pay just $500 and are allowed to give readings lasting seven minutes. \\"Fellows,\\" who \\"must have published, within three years prior to their application, at least one, but not more than two, original books,\\" pay nothing and read for 20 minutes.

The influence of Moslem music could also be heard in \\"Des oge mas quer eu trobar,\\" a 13th-century narration of the Nativity; it is found in a collection of Spanish songs about the Virgin illustrated with images of Christian, Jewish and Moslem musicians performing together.

He belonged to a species that over the years was to provide Mr. Bryan with many of his closest friends, and he is the first of the 13 gentlemen (and one lady, Dorothy Parker) who are celebrated in this amiable collective memoir. The others include Robert Benchley, S. J.Perelman and - less predictably, in this connection -John Steinbeck","excerpt":"they range from well-remembered figures like Fred Allen and Marc Connelly to half-forgotten ones like the author Finis Farr and the mural-painter and dedicated practical joker Hugh Troy.

In 1993, Ms. Wilson, who had trained as a jazz musician, changed career directions, releasing an album, \\"Blue Light 'Til Dawn,\\" that gave her free rein over her experiences. She mixed pop and jazz and rural blues, and she and her band played them all from a distance. Using mandolins, violins, guitars and a variety of percussion instruments, the group sounded like an American version of a band from the Caribbean or Africa, with each instrument keeping to its prescribed role, with complete rhythmic independence. There isn't anything like it in American popular music, and Ms. Wilson went from the obscurity of a jazz career  to an appearance on David Letterman show, and an invitation to be a permanent member of its band.         Ms. Wilson performed at Town Hall on Friday night, and she brought all her talents to bear on her material, using a jazz improvisational sensibility and her own set of melodies to create a consistent musical environment that stayed emotionally charged.

It is actually an Anglo-Indian production, acted by an all-Hindu cast for British Instructional Films, with a Teutonic flavor imparted by Herr Frank Osten's direction and E. Schunemann's excellent camera work. Technically it is a great advance on India's first film, \\"The Light of Asia,\\" a naive production which did not greatly appeal to Western audiences. But \\"Shiraz\\" will appeal for its romantic and moving story, its great pictorial and poetic beauty, the rich strangeness of the Eastern pageantry which it unfolds before our eyes. It has defects, but they can be forgiven. It needs apter subtitling. The acting, judged by Western standards, lacks force and fervor, though a great improvement in that respect on previous Indian pictures. Its lovers do not burn with fierce fires","excerpt":"they rather languish through a linked sweetness overlong drawn out.The acting is a little too pallid for the story, which is alive with barbaric life and color. It is the true tale of the beautiful woman in whose honor the unique Taj Mahal at Agra was raised, of the humble artist who designed it and the great Shah who built it. Selima had been rescued as a child from a raided caravan. She was brought up with Shiraz, a potter's son, who grew to love his beautiful foster sister. When she was stolen by slave raiders Shiraz followed her. But Selima, sold finally to the Shah Jehan, had won his love despite all the plotting of her jealous rival, Dalia. She was discovered to be of royal birth and she became Mumtaz Mahal, the bride of the Shah. When Shiraz follows her to the palace he is discovered and sentenced to be trampled to death by elephants. At the last moment he is reprieved, but not before he has contributed the one big thrill in the film. Eighteen years later Selima dies and the Shah, in his grief, gives orders for a mausoleum that shall have no equal in the world. It is the humble foster brother who submits the most beautiful design. Shah Jehan, lest he should design anything more lovely, orders the architect to be blinded. \\"Sire,\\" he is told, \\"there is no need. He is blind already.\\"Memorable Photography.The production of \\"Shiraz,\\" we are informed, involved a cast of 50,000 people, 300 camels, seven elephants and the whole standing army of Jaipur. Herr Osten has made the best use of his material and his camera men have given us some really unforgettable vision of the Taj Mahal and the gardens and palace of Jaipur. Seeta Devi, who acts the part of Selima, and Miss E. Rama Rau, as Dalia, her rival, are two very lovely women.India is a difficult country to produce pictures in. Not that the raw material is not there, for where could be found a land with a more romantic history, more diverse peoples and customs, stranger or more beautiful architecture—a land, too, where the sun always shines? But India unfortunately also possesses the defects of some of these very qualities. The diversity of peoples and re??? means that there is no common sound of screen material on which to draw; the sun that renders filming so easy makes the developing of the negatives impossible in a shade temperature of 110 degrees Fahrenheit without artificial refrigeration. The greatest difficulty is the securing of Indian actresses. The only Indian women of good character who will consent to act in public are either those who have received an advanced education on Western lines or those of no education and the humblest origin. For instance, in \\"Shiraz\\" Miss Rama Rau is a Cashmir girl of distinguished Brahmin family and is about to take her degree in philosophy at Madras University. \\"Shiraz\\" also illustrates the religious difficulties with which the producer is beset in India. \\"Shiraz\\" historically has a Mohammedan basis, but is acted mainly by HindusHeat and Dust.India having refused to grant a preference to British films over the products of Hollywood and having declared that the most important need of all is for more all-Indian productions, may herself take steps to remove the difficulties and inhibitions with which picture making is now surrounded. But at present these are formidable. An Indian cooperative society, for instance, which essayed a propaganda film a year ago had to have the women's parts taken by beardless undergraduates. Being unprovided with electrical equipment, the film makers had to work with natural light. Now, as has been stated, the sun shines brightly and constantly in India, but Indian houses have been designed to exclude its rays. Before the interior of a typical Indian village house could be filmed it had to be unroofed. As the hot weather drew near filming ceased to be possible at all after 10 A. M., for neither actors nor camera could stand the heat of the sun. Even if they could, the dust in the air, which is carried by the hot winds of April and May, would have rendered filming impossible.The negatives could not be developed on the Indian plains without the use of extravagant quantities of ice, so they had to be taken to the lower ranges of the Himalayas. Here the heavy rain prostrated the photographic staff with malaria, but the film was finished nevertheless.India's difficulties are not entirely those of production. The exhibitor also has his problems. The alleged deleterious effect of Western screen eroticism on the prestige of the white races in India and on the morals of the native population has been pooh-poohed away by the recent report of the Indian Government Cinema Commission. But there are other problems. From 90 to 95 per cent, of the rural population of India is illiterate and it is therefore useless to throw captions on the screen. The pictures must be made self-explantory, and when one considers the strangeness of Western life and actions to the native mind it will be seen that this is no easy matter.The Indian market, however, is well worth studying. Its surface has so far been barely scratched. There are only 300 picture theatres for a teeming population of some 300,000,000. The Indian, however, readily acquires the picture habit when it is made easy for him and laughs heartily at Charlie Chaplin at first introduction. When India's millions really begin to go to picture houses many new film fortunes will be made.

He graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in Elizabeth, N.J., and then earned a B.S. degree from The Ohio State University. He married Filomena Rotolo on June 17, 1945","excerpt":"they recently celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary with their family. After working at the Schering Corporation, he went on to have a distinguished 57 - year career at Rutgers University as a Professor and later as a Professor Emeritus. Dr. Manganelli received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Environmental Science at Rutgers, and became a pioneer, an educator, and an innovator in the fields of Air, Water, and Noise Pollution Studies. He was in the forefront in developing cutting-edge environmental education programs and in performing and publishing state-of-the-art research, and had the unique ability and distinguished record of successfully predicting where the demand for information and instruction would develop. There are many examples of his pioneering efforts. In the early 1950's, he was the first in the United States to develop a Graduate level Air Pollution Training Program. He was a pioneer and an early innovator in the study of noise pollution as it relates to health in the workplace. Many of the most prominent professionals in the United States working in the Environmental field from 1950 to the present were students of Dr. Manganelli. Dr. Manganelli was appointed to the New Jersey Clean Air Council by every Governor for the last 40 years, and served for the entire time as a Council member and for a time as its Chair. He has received numerous honors, awards, and citations for this service and for his distinguished accomplishments and service to many professional organizations, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency; the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection; the Air, the Water, and the Noise Pollution Control Associations; the American Industrial Hygiene Association; and Rutgers University. Dr. Manganelli's devotion to teaching and advising generations of undergraduate and graduate students earned him numerous teaching awards and led to the formation of several scholarships in his name, among them the Raymond M. Manganelli Scholarship awarded each year since 1992 at Rutgers University. Dr. Manganelli led a life characterized by a colleague at Rutgers as ''remarkably balanced.'' His passions included his family, Rutgers, Civil War history, 6mile-per-day jogging, educational and environmental issues, things Italian, and Ohio State football. Dr. Manganelli was an active member of Holy Spirit Roman Catholic Church of Union, N.J. He is survived by Filomena, his beloved wife of 60 years; son and daughter-in-law, Dr. Raymond L. and Cathy Manganelli of Manhasset, N.Y.; daughter and son-in-law, Alida and Larry Karas of Hillside, N.J.; four grandchildren, Thomas and Christopher Manganelli, and Michael and Nicole Karas; a brother, Michael Manganelli; and sisters, Emily Davis and Dorothy Sutherland, and their families, as well as the family of his late sister, Margarita King. The Funeral will be from McCracken Funeral Home, 1500 Morris Avenue, Union, on Monday at 8:30am. Funeral Mass at Holy Spirit Roman Catholic Church (corner of Morris Avenue and Suburban Road in Union) at 9:30 am. Interment will be at Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, N.J. The family will receive friends at the McCracken Funeral Home on Saturday, 2-4 & 7-9 pm, and Sunday, 15pm. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate donations to the ''Raymond M.

By Andrew Bard Schmookler.  400 pp. Berkeley: University of California. $19.95.     SINCE the middle of the 19th century, a majority of social scientists and a substantial minority of historians have believed that a search for laws of history would be fruitful.

Such efforts are implicitly or explicitly anthropological","excerpt":"they recognize that the theorist who relentlessly focuses on a few cultural forms will never see the forest for the trees.

Meanwhile, John Medeski has been focusing on solo acoustic piano, along with various collaborations, like his work with the Boston-based band Club d'Elf; on Thursday he will play a duo concert with Kid Koala, the turntable virtuoso and sound collagist, at Merkin Hall. None of this activity should be considered a sign of Medeski Martin & Wood's balkanization or imminent demise. While it's true that the group recently released a valedictory compilation -- ''Note Bleu: Best of the Blue Note Years,'' culled from six albums from 1998 to 2005 -- that merely marked the end of a record-label relationship. The band has its own label now, Indirecto Records, on which it recently released ''Out Louder,'' a repeat collaboration with the guitarist John Scofield; in a couple of weeks he and the band will begin a 13-city tour together as Medeski Scofield Martin & Wood.

So is it over? Did the Federal Reserve manage, all too well, to yank the economy to a crawl? It may seem so on the news that April unemployment jumped 0.3 points, to 5.8 percent, and payrolls fell for the first time in more than two years. But no, analysts said, the expansion is still alive -- but humbled. \\"This is not a recession,\\" said the head of the National Association of Manufacturers. And Labor Secretary Reich saw \\"no evidence that the economy's going into reverse.\\" The bond market like it just fine, as long-term interest rates headed down close to 7 percentCHECKKKKKKK, the lowest level in a year.  . . . but Layoffs Slow Down But look at it another way. The truly wrenching part of the job picture in recent years has been the mass layoffs, which, properly placed, can devastate whole neighborhoods or towns. But according to the latest employment report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, fewer layoffs were announced in April than in any month since May 1993. In fact, for 1995's first four months, the report said, layoffs were down by nearly half from last year. So even though unemployment is up, \\"wholesale cuts are slowing,\\" said John Challenger, the firm's executive vice president. And \\"layoff figures are more indicative of how companies are looking at workforce reduction.\\"  LIABILITY  Bankruptcy Over Implants?  The breast-implant mess keeps taking a toll -- and not just on the true victims, the women involved. Last week Dow Corning, facing 20,000 lawsuits, said it might have to file for bankruptcy protection, which would put a halt to all the litigation. Not that it would be broke. The company is owned by Dow Chemical and Corning, and also last week came news that Marion Merrell Dow -- 71 percent owned by Dow Chemical -- would be bought by Hoechst of Germany. What that means in the industry is yet another huge merger, this one creating the world's No. 2 drug maker, right after Glaxo Wellcome. And what it means for Dow Chemical is $5.1 billion (out of a total purchase price of $7.1 billion) to help it with implant settlements.  TELEVISION Danger! Ad Rates on the Loose!  Wait a second. Hasn't everyone in the universe already seen \\"Jurassic Park\\" 11 times? Well, NBC clearly hopes they'll make it an even dozen, for it paid $50 million for the rights to broadcast it, the first showing being tonight. And advertisers are paying $650,000 for 30-second spots -- an otherworldly figure that puts the event (that's the way NBC wants you to think of it, as an \\"event,\\" not a mere \\"movie\\") up there with such pivotal moments in world history as this year's Academy Awards or the \\"Cheers\\" finale in 1993. (Of course, it's still well behind recent Super Bowl ad rates, which are too absurd to mention.) Among the advertisers, of course, is the Ford Explorer -- which, you'll recall, got rather unkind treatment from Mr. Rex. AUTOS It's Drizzling in Detroit Well, Chrysler has been saying -- to fend off pesky takeover offers -- that it needed its $7.5 billion nest egg in case rainy days returned, and it may be right. Last week auto makers said sales were slipping badly -- off 6.1 percent in April, the fourth straight monthly drop. (One exception: Ford keeps selling light trucks","excerpt":"they rose 16 percent.) What's up? For one thing, even as interest rates ease, car-loan rates stay stubbornly high -- not to mention car prices. Maybe it's just part of a slowing economy. And maybe, with so many good used cars around -- thanks in part to leasing -- buyers don't care so much about shiny and new. But whatever the reason, watch for more rebates and good deals.  BLAME GAME A Team Effort at Barings Nicholas Leeson is still in a Frankfurt jail, taking most of the heat for the collapse of Barings two months ago. But the new owner of what's left of Barings -- the Dutch company ING -- decided last week that it was unlikely that Mr. Leeson was the lone gunman, the supervillain of the piece. Without ladling out fixed doses of guilt, ING ousted 21 top Barings executives, saying they had \\"functional responsibility\\" for the mess at the Singapore outpost. The clear message: Even if those executives didn't know the disastrously risky road Mr. Leeson was taking, they should have known. BANKING Tellers With a Difference Yes, First Chicago had any number of sound, sober reasons for that $3 teller fee. And who knows -- maybe it is the best way to keep banking costs low for the low of balance. But let's face it: walking freely up to a teller (after waiting in line, of course) is right up there with sunshine and tulips -- it seems almost a constitutional right. Tinker with tulips and you make yourself an awfully easy target for all manner of reactions, from indignant to teasing. And sure enough, some Chicago-area banks had a field day, as Lake Forest Bank gave $3 to customers after their transactions were finished, and a Harris branch handed out dollar bills to customers who asked whether it charged fees. What did Richard Thomas, First Chicago's chairman, think of all this? \\"A little silly,\\" he said. NEWSPAPERS NEWS TO 42D ST.: SO LONG In 1930, The Daily News built an Art Deco temple for itself on -- where else? -- 42d Street, the center of the known universe. The building so resonated with nostalgic newspaperdom that it was used as a set in the \\"Superman\\" movies. But like the world, The News has changed. In 1947, its daily circulation was 2.4 million; today, the paper's bruises still healing from labor battles, it's scarcely a third of that. The payroll has plunged from 9,000 to a little over 1,000. The presses left the 42d Street building more than a decade ago. And last week The News made its biggest symbolic break with its past, leaving that home behind and moving to a single floor across town -- one with the high-tech bells and whistles deemed necessary for a modern paper.  PUBLISHING Today's News (Net Wt., 12 Oz.) And here's another sign of changing journalistic times: when Times Mirror named a new chief executive last week, it wasn't someone from the ranks but Mark Willes, a General Mills vice chairman with no media experience. His message: \\"Start from the consumer,\\" strive to be \\"the low-cost producer,\\" \\"refresh\\" products just as food companies tinker with cereals and cake mixes. Yes, many newspapers are hurting -- Times Mirror's two big papers, The Los Angeles Times and Newsday, reported big circulation drops last week. But what's coming? Banner headlines saying \\"Light and Fluffy\\" or \\"Only 17 Calories\\"?  BROADCASTING The Murdoch Exemption Some matters, it seems, transcend the laws of the land -- matters like Rupert Murdoch's ownership of American TV stations. Yes, the F.C.C. said last week, Mr. Murdoch and his News Corp. had violated foreign-ownership laws -- but the agency said it had no intention of doing anything about it. No fines, no drastic cutbacks in his ownership stake. Why? As one commissioner, James Quello, put it, the \\"compelling public interest\\" lay in the creation of a fourth network to promote competition. As for Mr. Murdoch, he rejoiced that the \\"meritless, wild and malicious charges of some of our competitors\\" had been rejected. But of course the ownership issue was clearly not meritless -- just rejected.

The beautiful command of mannerisms and rich inventiveness possessed by each would, assure that their getting together would result in a broadly comic show.Fortunately, the screen play handed to them for their conjunction in \\"The Law Is the Law,\\" a Franco-Italian production, offers more than the telephone directory would and, as a consequence, there's a lot of broad-beamed humor in this new film that came to the Baronet last night. But, when you come right down to it, it doesn't offer so very much more that the fellows are able to transform it into the joy you might anticipate.The idea sounds absolutely priceless. It finds a French customs officer set against a wily Italian smuggler in a Franco-Italian border town. And since the customs officer is none too clever and the smuggler is a devious little gent, their long-drawn and pleasing competition is bound, at some point, to hit a snag.It does when the smuggler discovers that his stubborn adversary, who thinks he's French, actually was born in the kitchen of a border hotel — and the kitchen was in Italy!This sets a tremendous turmoil raging. The customs officer is put on the pan. Is he a Frenchman or is he an Italian? Is he legally qualified to stay in France or must he transfer across the border (which zigzags through the village) and renationalize himself? And if he does this—or, rather, when he does this—is he rendered liable for fleeing service in the Italian Army and committing bigamy on the basis of having a divorced wife in the Italian sector and a perfectly good one in France?As we say, it sounds terrific, and what Fernandel and Toto do with it, as the officer and smuggler, respectively, is the very best they can. They pop their eyes (they are both eye-poppers)","excerpt":"they saw the air fifteen ways with their hands; they make gestures of contempt and vilification; they alternately wallow in despairs, for it turns out the wife of the smuggler is the ex-wife of the customs officer and, when the bigamy charge is presented, the smuggler finds himself sprouting horns.But, incredibly, the script by Jacques Emmanuel and Jean-Charles Tacchella is considerably forced and concerned with monotonous legalisms that sound funnier than they come out in the talk. There is more conversation than action and, with comics as agile as these, it is wasteful to leave them standing with a lot of words falling out of their mouths. Inevitably the complications become redundant and strangely banal.That is what happens in this picture, before its hour and three-quarters is through, and one might note a parallel monotony in the sluggish direction of Christian-Jaque. He doesn't match the crisp inventions of the actors with facile situation inventions of his own. The momentum of the comic mixup runs down before it covers the course.However, the two stars do wonders with what they have to do and Noel Roquevert and Mario Besozzi are funny as police officers. Nathalie Nerval is also amusing as the disputed wife.Herman Weinberg has made a good translation of the French dialogue into English subtitles.

College students don’t need to go to college anymore to expand their cultural awareness–they can do so in their bedrooms at a lower cost (after all, surfing the Net doesn’t cost one thousands of dollars a semester). The “generation gap” as the boomers define it, has also changed. A generation ago, your parents were your parents","excerpt":"they saw their job as parenting, disciplining, and the like. Thus, this provided ample ground for generation gap confrontations. You went to college, and experienced things your parents didn’t let you see, do things your parents didn’t let you do.

Our generation doesn’t hate our parents, and we don’t want to; our generation doesn’t want to rebel. We’re busy wrapped up in our own little lives, which have been cultivated by our parents.

It was created for Dior by the legendary perfumer Edmond Roudnitska in 1972, and it feels like 1932 and 2022 at the same time. And that means that Diorella is -- there's just no other way to describe it -- strange. And that's good.    A rich, tasteful fragrance sauntered by one evening on long legs. I was at a Fragonard party in Paris with the perfume expert Luca Turin, and he shrugged it off. ''Luxury scent,'' he said. ''Not chic.''

He said, ''Um,'' and squinted at the ceiling as if the definition were written up there. ''Chic,'' he finally said, ''is when you don't have to prove you have money. Chic is not aspirational. Chic is all about humor, which means chic is about intelligence.'' Then he added: ''And there has to be oddness. Luxury is comfortable, expensive and conformist.

By an ingenious use of shadows, lights and photographic angles Mr. Leni has created the eerie atmosphere necessary in a house where sudden death and sinister happenings occur. Those scenes where the band of thieves carry a body through the hall are particularly effective.In the sequences depicting a New Year's celebration in San Francisco's Chinatown and in those chapters devoted to the pearl fishers in Honolulu and others where a Nautch dancer is murdered for a string of pearls, Mr. Leni introduces some exceptionally clever and forceful camera effects.The atmospheric mood is further heightened by having a figure of death hover over the house in the desert and also by the insertion of a skeleton's hand in some of the scenes when the pearls are shown. Although it might seem that the director has overindulged somewhat in camera angles and menacing lights and shadows, the results are never tiresome","excerpt":"they seem to be a natural and integral part of the development and action of the film.The story, briefly, concerns the attempts of a band of thieves to lay their hands on the famous Phillimore pearls that have been brought from Honolulu by a Chinese detective. The action takes place first in Honolulu, then in San Francisco and finally in the desert home of Philip Madden.In the dual rôle of Philip Madden and Jerry Delaney, Hobart Bosworth gives a creditable performance, but the acting honors must be bestowed on K. Sojin as Charlie Chan, an Oriental detective. As Sally Phillimore and then as Paula Jordan, Marian Nixon has little more to do than look attractive.

Why is that so? I'm going to let the cat out of the bag, because the casting is telltale anyhow, and because it may save someone wear and tear. Miss Palmer plays the murderer, and by the time she has materialized on screen she has already killed a half dozen nubile young camp counselors, for reasons it would be futile to try to explain. All these nice kids have been perforated in various ways on the day of the title, and yet Miss Palmer appears in a pale sweater that is very, very clean. Movie magic!In view of the above disclosure, it may not be necessary for anyone to wait for Miss Palmer to be beheaded in the movie's denouement, although she does at last get her sweater dirty in this scene. The same goes for the post-finale, a kind of sneaky coda, which anyone who saw \\"Carrie\\" will find phenomenally familiar.\\"Friday the 13th,\\" which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, was produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham, who is known as the producer of \\"Last House on the Left,\\" except in those circles where he isn't known at all. Mr. Cunningham's brand of horror is reasonably suspenseful, though none too new: a nice young counselor wanders away from the other counselors, and the audience waits nervously for the ax to fall. It falls smack into somebody's forehead on at least one memorable occasion.More interesting than the bloodshed, somehow, is the middle-class ordinariness with which Mr. Cunningham invests the characters' conversations","excerpt":"they seem to be inciting the killer's fury by chatting about vitamins and playing Monopoly. The counselors are played by a cast of pleasant newcomers, and what happens to them really is a shame.Mr. Cunningham often zeroes in closely on his victims from the killer's point of view, but he doesn't always use this device fairly.

This spring we placed three arborvitae in 18-inch tubs on our high- rise terrace. The trees now have much browning. How often should we water them? How can we encourage them to bush out at the bases? Should we use anti-desiccant sprays? L.B., Manhattan.     A.  The browning is natural and the trees will green up again in spring; arborvitae are susceptible to this although many nurseries now propagate improved cultivars, which do not have this characteristic. The trees will drop some of their lower branches and once gone, they do not reform. Anti-desiccant sprays would be helpful, but application is not necessary. However, do not neglect watering, especially in January, February and March when there may be lack of rainfall, or snow, or sudden thaws. The soil should be kept moist to the touch. Ginkgo Seedlings     Q.    I have found several seedlings around the base of a ginkgo tree, which I have transplanted to small pots. WIll I have any luck keeping these trees indoors? Will they go into a dormant stage this winter? A.A., Yonkers, N.Y.     A. This question is answered here because so many gardeners try to keep outdoor hardy species indoors for the winter, especially trees. Ideally, these seedlings should be wintered outdoors in a coldframe to protect the young seedlings as well as the pots in which they are planted. (Even bonsai of hardy tree species should be kept outdoors.) Yes, the seedlings will go through a natural dormant period. The ginkgo tree endures air pollution and is often planted on city streets. It is an ancient species and is often referred to as a living fossil for the ginkgo can be traced back to the age of dinosaurs. The species was probably wiped out in this hemisphere by glaciers, but it survived in the Orient. Its fan-shaped leaves suggest those of the maidenhair fern. More on Seed Saving     On Oct. 14 a question about saving marigold and cockscomb seed was asked and the recommendation was to buy fresh seed every year since most of the popular garden annuals are hybrids. Nine years ago, when we moved to Missouri, I bought and planted a border of ageratum and dwarf yellow marigolds. I saved the marigold seed and to make a long story short, I haven't bought any more marigold seeds. This year I even skipped buying ageratum plants, when I found that they had seeded themselves and hardy-looking plants developed. The border this year was every bit as beautiful as the original border I planted in 1982. Furthermore, the marigolds I had this year came from seed I had saved in 1987. Mrs. E.P. Jr., Seymour, Mo.

And they multiply with a speed that both shocks and mystifies. Insects on house plants are now proliferating in these longer, brighter days. The safest control is a weekly upside-down dunking of leaves in a warm soapy water bath. Dishwashing liquids may suffice but, even better, use a product formulated for this purpose, like Safer Agro-Chem's insecticidal soap. Take time, however, to read the label before plunging in. The leaves of some palms, euphorbias and ferns can be burned by strong soaps and a dilute solution may be preferable along with an immediate clear-water rinse. Don't be embarrassed to throw any house plants that are beyond repair into the trash. \\n\\nFading Ficus \\n\\n Q. \\n\\nI had my ficus tree outdoors last summer on a patio, where it did beautifully. I brought it in before frost and it dropped all its leaves. Now it's almost bare. There are still signs of green under the bark and some little shoots are starting to appear. Will it recover? H. M. M., Rochester, N.Y. \\n\\n\\nA. The ficus trees and shrubs that are so treasured for indoor greenery are tropical or warm-temperate zonemembers of the mulberry family. Those serving as house plants do appreciate a summer vacation outdoors. But it's not unusual for species like Ficus benjamina to go into shock when hauled indoors in autumn","excerpt":"they show their displeasure by dropping their leaves. This is always hard on the gardener. But winter is actually this plant's period of rest and it's important to resist the temptation to compensate for leaf loss by overwatering. The soil should be allowed to become nearly dry between waterings. With spring approaching, now's the time to encourage new shoots and leaves by adding to each water application a diluted solution of fish emulsion fertilizer, or similar high-nitrogen product (nitrogen is the first number of three on the label). \\nRhubarb Die-Out \\n\\n Q. \\n\\nAlongside our house are several clumps of rhubarb. They get a fair amount of sun. In early spring we add dried cow manure and usually do so again after harvesting in the middle of June, when the plant usually comes up vigorously. But now, whatever we do, the stems and leaves go limp and die almost completely by July. The plants date from 1973, but recently the patch has been declining. Several clumps are gone altogether. R. N. W., Oneonta, N.Y. \\n\\n\\nA. The delicious stalks of rhubarb (Rheum rhabarbarum) are such a favorite for pies that this hardy perennial herb is sometimes called the pie plant. Rhubarb needs rich, moist soil, so you've been on the right track in adding dried cow manure so faithfully. But rhubarb clumps typically produce well for only about two decades. Your plants' life spans are just about up. As soon as the soil is workable and no longer muddy, dig up and discard all remaining root fragments lest they harbor remains of stalk borers. Then, begin again by planting fresh clumps, several feet apart. Allow a minimum of two per family member to assure a bountiful supply. \\nNonflowering Hibiscus \\n\\n Q. \\n\\nI've had a hibiscus plant for several year that's stopped flowering. I have transplanted it and cut it down. It stands near a south window and looks healthy. Why would it now go on strike and not want to bloom anymore? R. W., New York City\\n\\n\\nA. There are 250 to 300 species of hibiscus, including trees, shrubs, annuals and herbaceous perennials, most of them native to warm regions. The showy Chinese hibiscus (H. rosa-sinensis), the state flower of Hawaii, is probably the most popular with windowsill gardeners; when it flowers poorly, there are several possible causes. Hermann Pigors, the owner of Oak Hill Gardens in Dundee, Ill., who grows these plants commercially, has found that hibiscus flower buds develop best when the humidity is high enough to produce strong plants and when nighttime temperatures are somewhat cool. Full sun is essential, and so is a high phosphorous fertilizer (the middle number on the package), such as 15-30-15. Hibiscuses also do best in somewhat acid soil. You can manage this most easily by top-dressing the pot each season with cooled grounds of coffee or tea.\\n\\n\\nAddress questions to Garden News, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

This makes microwaving not only the fastest way to cook but in many cases the most nutritious as well because it is the least destructive to the nutrients of the food, according to Theodore Labuza, professor of food technology at the University of Minnesota. Nutrients most often lost to heating of food are the B vitamins, vitamin C and thiamine. The faster a food is raised to its cooked temperature, the fewer nutrients it loses. There is no danger in eating microwaved foods. Q. I remember a science class in which we had to memorize a list of the ''seven simple machines.''

Dr. Eugene Ferguson, professor emeritus of history of technology at the University of Delaware, says this question has long been in debate. Many historians assert that there are five basic machine components called ''simple'' machines; others say six or seven.

The work reached the United States the following year, at Tanglewood, where the Boston Symphony Orchestra took it up again in a moving performance that closed the current season here this afternoon.   The ''War Requiem'' is a powerful synthesis of the great Romantic tradition of the mass as choral and symphonic drama with Britten's most personal sphere of expression, the song cycle of English poetry.

Smeets and Tynagel’s furniture and objects not only err on the side of dysfunction, but they are also distinguished by a distinct dark streak. On the occasion of Studio Job’s first major retrospective, at Moss in New York, Felix Burrichter chatted long-distance with Smeets, the duo’s mouthpiece, to talk about new projects, cultural DNA and maintaining optimism in times of recession.  It seems to me that your work has a sort of pan-Low Country aesthetic. It doesn’t have any of this optimistic, quirky pseudo-functionalism like a lot of contemporary Dutch design — it’s much darker than that, more in the tradition of 16th-century Flemish painters like Hieronymus Bosch.  I think you have a point there, but Nynke and I are not per se ambassadors of a certain country. I feel that creativity surpasses borders, and won’t stop at some political border. So we refuse to be called “Dutch” designers, although we are Dutch designers.  I think it’s more interesting to talk about us as European designers, because I think the whole of Europe is one culture. And for us, the Netherlands alone are not big enough to refer to because we have a lot of inspirations that are not coming out of Dutch soil. I think that we study the signs of iconography, and iconography in Europe is more or less my nature ground. Nynke and I could never do a Mickey Mouse installation, and I think that someone from the U.S. could maybe never do a “Mona Lisa.” It has to do with the place where you were born, with your influences, with language, your cultural DNA.  You’re mentioning the European cultural DNA, but you also sometimes appropriate some U.S. clichés of late 19th century, early 20th century — for example, in Robber Baron. Yes, you use those clichés to say something about the future or the present situation. But I also don’t think that the past of 200 years ago is very different from the past of 1 minute ago. You can source out fiction, because you never know if the past is real or unreal, so you can use all those pieces and elements to tell something about how you feel at the moment. That’s why we like history: it’s a cliché, and we like clichés. They are there to use as communication tools. That’s why I think that Nynke and I never really designed, because we just used icons that were already there. Icons, archetypes or clichés are a universal language","excerpt":"they stand for a word or an expression, or for mood, which you can then communicate. You know, the best juggler of icons in the U.S. is Jeff Koons. He’s also the best executor in icons. Sometimes we feel more connected with the world of somebody like Koons than we would ever feel to the work of Philippe Starck. You’re not interested in functionalism at all? No, not at all! Nynke and I also don’t get that new trend where designers are now going back to functionalism because of the recession and the bad economy. I don’t want to go back to the 1950s, and I don’t want to use this recession as a new tool to squeeze out some commercial ideas. We recently said to each other, “O.K., from now on we really stop making design because design now forces us to go into functionalism, and we don’t want to go there.” So from now on we will just make art or something. … Studio Job | The Art of Clichéd Design"},{"year":"1980","title":"OF course they're lamps.

There are maxi-singles and mini-albums, which can be virtually the same thing, with from four to six tracks, and all sorts of shorter-thanalbum, longer-than-single disks that may be issued at either 45 or 33-1/3 revolutions per minute and are called E.P.'s, for Extended Play.   Most of these formats are not new; they were tried back in the 1950's and discarded because they failed to catch on with an albuminfatuated public. Now the story is different. New wave rock has proved particularly amenable to these various in-between record formats. An E.P. maxi-single or mini-album sells for considerably less than an album, and with many rock and pop albums these days including one or two good songs and eight or 10 inferior ones, the value of shorter, cheaper records that weed out some of the filler is evident.

ON STAGE, LETTERS FORM THE LITERATI"},{"year":"1976","title":"\\"Scent of a Woman\\" is about a journey and a destination. The journey is funny, acid and intriguing. The destination is mawkish, melodramatic and interminable.A young soldier is called to present himself at a house in Turin and place himself for seven days at the service of a retired captain, blinded in an explosion. The captain, played by Vittorio Gassman, is a handsome, vigorous man whose aristocratic arrogance suffers horribly not so much from the deprivation as the humiliation of his blindness.He is bitter, sarcastic, domineering, and his handicap has inflated his native lechery to satyriasis. All these qualities are fully displayed in the curious train trip he sets out upon with his hapless traveling companion. The destination is Naples","excerpt":"they stop at Genoa and Rome.The captain continually makes scenes. In the train, drunk, he insists on pressing whisky on a starchy old gentleman. When the latter only pretends to drink, the captain — whose other senses are almost sharp enough to compensate for blindness — slaps him and drives him from the compartment.In Genoa, the captain embarks on a hilarious search for a prostitute. He can smell women, he tells Ciccio, his companion, but for proper choice needs a description as well. So he goes through Genoa sniffing and considering Ciccio's thumbnail descriptions until he meets a woman who seems to suit.He requires assistance — hence Ciccio — but won't admit it. When he sits in a cafe he demands a newspaper as well as coffee. In Genoa, when a woman asks directions, he insists on giving them even though he can't see and doesn't know the city.These things work well, and the relationship between the tormented captain and the good natured, though sometimes rebellious Ciccio has humor and bite. It helps that the purpose of the journey is a mystery: Ciccio discovers a pistol and a portrait of a girl in the captain's suitcase.The Rome sequence is a heavier replay of the adventures in Genoa. And finally they arrive in Naples. The journey is over, but the movie has a long, long way to go.The captain is meeting another blinded officer, with whom he has a suicide pact. At the same time, there is the girl in the portrait who loves him, and whom he loves, but whose love—because of his blindness—he is too proud to accept. Love, pride and death contend, but the real struggle is between bathos and tedium.\\"Scent\\" was well liked at last year's Cannes Festival, and Mr. Gassman won the Best Actor prize. In retrospect it is hard to see why. His performance has force, but his role is paper-thin. He is a comic Iion in the early scenes When matters become serious he is nothing but roaring.

Edited by Deborah Keenan and Roseann Lloyd. (Milkweed Editions, Paper, $11.95.) Women have often used the metaphor of exile to describe their position at the margins of our culture. Those wishing to enter the American mainstream frequently feel divided between traditionally female values and the male-defined values of the marketplace","excerpt":"they struggle to shape the culture they enter, rather than be shaped by it. Given this context, we can doubly welcome the publication of \\"Looking for Home: Women Writing About Exile,\\" an anthology of poetry written by women of diverse backgrounds, all with different definitions of alienation. Some of the poems describe the experience of learning a new language; some present women who want to hoard the words of their native tongue, to keep them safe, as Meredith Stricker writes, \\"against the enemy's decoding.\\" There are poems about migration, the pulls of conflicting allegiances, the weight of history and the search for a unified self. Others tell stories of economic deprivation, chemical dependency and illness, of life as a lesbian in a culture hostile to sexual nonconformity. The collection includes work by poets as familiar as Sharon Olds and Denise Levertov, as well as poems by unknown writers. Its principle of organization remains somewhat obscure -- it is divided into seven sections with elusive quotations as titles, and even within one section two poems from one writer may or may not be placed together. Yet the anthology richly communicates both the singularity and the universality of women's deepest concerns. The poems that the editors, Deborah Keenan and Roseann Lloyd, have chosen may be more or less sophisticated in their technique, but they rarely strike a false note, and in most of them one hears language freighted with experience, the real voices of real women.

Here is another instance of a photoplay being far better than the title would lead one to expect. It was directed by Walter Morosco, who has performed the task with originality and keen imagination, thus bringing to the screen a blithe effort. Except for some utterly improbable incidents, which nevertheless are part and parcel or such a frivilous affair, Mr. Morosco can be said to have obtained a pleasing naturalness in the performances of the players. They seem to think about what they are doing","excerpt":"they submerge their own personalities, and, despite the lightness of the vehicle, there are many pleasing human touches which lift this film out of the usual rut.Only in one or two situations is the comedy a trifle wild, such as where an illiterate Russian tosses an apple across a hotel lobby and also where he is confronted with the problem of tackling an artichoke. Otherwise, Mr. Morosco has maintained restraints in a subject which in other hands might have been an extremely tempestuous tale.Denise Lake, a young woman of superior birth and physical attraction, while in Hungary discovers that flirting is most enjoyable. One of her victims, a young officer, decides to jump into the river, but he is rescued by Howard Lake, Denise's husband, who never for a moment supposed that the cause of the young man's desperation was his own wife. Subsequently Denise's heart flutters at the sight of a hotel violinist, and Howard decides to teach his wife a lesson by bribing the musician, Tade Adrian, to pretend to be in love with Denise. Howard gives Tade half of a $5,000 draft, promising him the other portion of the document when Denise is disillusioned.The musician harks back to his old family, picturing his father as an aristocrat who couldn't even touch wine unless it possessed the true flavor. He tells Denise of the great mansion where his family dwelt and impresses her with his family tree. Hence, when Howard believes it is time for Tade to receive the other half of the draft he discovers that the musician is so smitten with Denise that he lights a cigarette with that portion of the draft which Howard had given to him a few days before.The excellent comedy in the scene where through Frederic Stanhope's aid, Tade's mother, his uncouth father and little brother appear in a fashionable hotel is materially helped out by the organist who renders snatches of \\"The Volga Boatman.\\" Denise is humiliated when she realizes that her husband is looking at her from another table, while she is seated with Tade's incorrigible young brother and his low-brow parents.In an early chapter, Denise, following a flirtatious scene with Tade, greets her husband and appears to discover on his shoulder something resembling a blond hair. She smiles as she takes it between her fingers and stretches it to its full length. It looks somewhat substantial for a single hair, and eventually it turns out to be a string from the musician's violin.Irene Rich, with a fascinating new hair arrangement, lends no little talent and charm to the rôle of Denise. Huntly Gordon is natural and easy as Howard Lake. Victor Varconi impersonates the imaginative fiddler with a good understanding of the possibilties of the part.

According to members of the insurance industry and day-care providers, insurers perceive the centers as carrying a higher risk in the wake of several widely publicized cases of sexual abuse at day-care centers in different parts of the nation.   Several operators of licensed day-care centers in the county said they would have to shut down if they were unable to obtain liability insurance, which covers claims for bodily injury and other damages from products or practices. New York State law requires providers of day care to be insured as a condition of their licensing.   Even those centers able to renew their coverage are being charged more than three times the current rates for insurance, and operators at some of those centers said they may raise fees in order to offset the increased costs.

THE life of Velazquez, closely studied by Jonathan Brown and traced in a detail that may fairly be called enthralling, is a quite extraordinary story. A son of lesser Spanish nobility, born in the last year of the 16th century and apprenticed to a painter, Diego de Velazquez revealed in his teens an ability to paint directly from life that no artist in Seville could teach or rival. He painted people ostensibly carousing or cooking, yet as solid and unmoving as their own pots and pans, transfixed as if by some brooding inward mood (on which Mr. Brown is as uncommunicative as his subject). When he was 23 years old, with some equally arresting and arrested portraits to his credit, the phenomenal young man made his way to Madrid. After Philip IV had seen what Velazquez could do, no one else was allowed to paint the King (until Rubens arrived on a visit). It was love at sight, and on both sides. Rid of the squalor of kitchen life, the pictures still retained the same sense of living presence, the same impassivity and restraint","excerpt":"they suited perfectly the reticent Spanish style of kingship, which astonished and humbled more flamboyant courts.

Few of the living can see Mr. Arrau's career as a whole - it stretches far too far into the past. But clearly this long musical life - begun in Chile in 1903 and nurtured in Berlin before World War I- serves as connective tissue between the emotional generosity of the Romantic era and the respectful restraint of mid-20th century interpretive philosophy.

Yet it has been in the 1950's, 60's and 70's - an age of new classicism among performers - that Mr.  Arrau's major recording projects have taken place.

And one will catch, too, the salty flavor of the rugged Hebrides in the glimpses of local gatherings and the documentation of folkways.There is one quite exciting sequence showing the settlement of a feud by having three men from each rival clan sit on opposite sides of a boat and row without let or hindrance until all but one man drops. And picturesque, too, is the dramatization of the vegeance which the whiskey-smugglers take on a clan-convicted informer","excerpt":"they tie a herring on his head, dump him into the bay in a life-preserver and let him float there for the gulls to peck to death. (The culmination of this sequence is not as graphic as it sounds, fortunately.)But the story told against these backgrounds and with the benefit of these folksy events is more melodramatic than ethnic, more hackneyed than hewn from the rocks. It centers around a beautiful maiden who comes to live as a servant-girl in the home of a craggy old islander and his two laconic sons, with the younger of whom she quite naturally (being a healthy girl) falls in love. First she stirs an old feud between this family and the next-glen McFarishes, whose woolly and wily son, Willie, is not too dour to lark with a lass. And then, when the old man of the family has died of over-exertion at the oar, she causes the two smoldering brothers to have a long-drawn and fatal falling-out.Unfortunately, the screen play by Muriel and Sydney Box (the latter being also the producer) is a sketchy and choppy affair and quite a considerable truncation of the novel by L. A. G. Strong. Either by nature or by cutting, it is full of non sequiturs, and its suddenly happy ending is as fake as some indoor studio scenes. It is thoroughly out of character that the younger brother should finally kidnap the girl.In the role of the latter, Patricia Roc is lovely in form and grace, but her hair-dos, her dresses and her expressions smack more of Elstree than of the Hebrides. Finlay Currie, however, is rough and rock-ribbed as the bearded father of the clan and Maxwell Reed and Duncan Macrae are fierce and burrish as his beetle-browed sons. Andrew Crawford is bonny and irrepressible as the McFarish wolf, while the late Will Fyffe is slyly charming as a local scamp in a couple of scenes.

For a silkier, thicker mane, men and women are lathering up with shampoo and conditioner designed for coarse equine hair. The leading brand, Mane 'n Tail, once available only in horse specialty and feed shops, now sells 95 percent of its product to tail-deprived humans. Four factories work double shifts to fill orders, and annual sales reached $60 million last year (up from $500,000 in 1989). A PHENOMENON IS SIRED: Barely four years ago, Roger Dunavant, the president of Straight Arrow in Bethlehem, Pa., the maker of Mane 'n Tail, handed out samples to horse folk","excerpt":"they told him what a nice job the concoction did on their hair. Soon after, a market study found that 10 of 12 buyers were not using it on their ponies. A LEGAL HORSE RACE: To protect its good mane, Mr. Dunavant has sued 12 companies and accused them of misappropriating the Mane 'n Tail moniker. Dick Kaitz, the executive vice president of Palm Beach Products, makers of Lucky Kentucky Mane, Tail and Body Shampoo, said the charges were baseless: \\"They were turned down for a trademark for Mane 'n Tail. We had a legal opinion that gave us the go-ahead.\\" A BUCKET JOB: Instructions from the Mane 'n Tail bottle: \\"Add 1 oz. per gallon of warm water into a bucket. Pre-wet the coat with just water to remove excessive, loose dirt. Apply shampoo solution with a sponge or massage until a rich lather appears.\\" Directions on two new packaged-for-humans lines, Equenne and Conceived by Nature, indicate a little dab of the viscous shampoo will do ya, and forget the bucket. IT ISN'T PRELL, BUT . . .: John Fish, Kmart's hair-care buyer, said customers had requested Mane 'n Tail before he stocked the shelves of the chain's 2,350 stores with it. \\"We tested it in our quality assurance department and the information was that it was safe for humans,\\" he said. \\"It doesn't sell like Pantene Pro-V or Suave, but it sells very well.\\" A local price comparison found a 32-ounce bottle of Mane 'n Tail selling for $5.99, or about 19 cents an ounce; a 13-ounce bottle of Pantene for $3.19, or 25 cents an ounce, and a 15-ounce bottle of Suave, 99 cents, or 6 cents an ounce.

Indeed, listening to Pomerium Musices sing works by Busnoys and Johannes Ockeghem at Corpus Christi Church in Morningside Heights on Sunday afternoon was as disorienting as it was pleasing. Both 15th-century music and our own make use of the tonal center -- the home from which sounds go out in search of adventure and to which they return to rest -- but the dynamics of this operation have changed.   The older music floats in an orbit all its own. For no matter how often we encounter the early Renaissance today, it behaves strangely to ears enriched (or perhaps infected) by the abrupt homeward pull of the dominant seventh chord.

Macy & Company to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings, the court must approve a restructuring plan that satisfies its various creditors, roughly in this order of priority. The most senior creditors will likely get paid all of the principal they lent and perhaps the interest due. More junior bond holders will likely have to take stock in the company instead of cash. The previous stock holders will likely get nothing.   Currently, Macy's has the exclusive right to submit a plan to the bankruptcy court, but in March the court may allow other creditors to submit plans. By buying $449.3 million of debt, Federated Department Stores now has the right to try to assemble such a plan. It can achieve its goal of taking control of Macy's only by gaining the consent of most of the other creditors.    Dollar amounts are principal owed at the time of Macy's bankruptcy in January 1992. Secured Debt    These creditors have the right to foreclose and take control of specific company assets, such as stores. Their claims rank highest and they are most likely to be paid in cash. Prudential Mortgages   Loans secured by mortgages on 70 of Macy's 110 stores, originally made by Prudential Insurance. This is the most senior class of debt, with greater rights than other secured debt.    Federated bought half of this for $449.3 million, paying $109.3 million down and the rest - $340 million, plus interest - in three years. Federatged has an option to buy the other half at undisclosed terms. 2. Secured Bank Loans ACQUISITION FINANCING: $698.4 million    Two loans and a letter of credit from the 1986 leveraged buyout, secured by a variety of Macy's assets. SWISS BANK MORTGAGES: $553.8 million    Morgages on 49 stores, originallyput together by the Swinn Bank Corporation in 1988. CITIBANK FINANCING: $180.0 million    Loan secured by 10 stores.    These three groups of loans have largely been sold by the banks that originally made them and are now in the hands of speculative investors","excerpt":"they traded yesterday at 85 cents on the dollar. It now looks like holders of these loans will be paid 100 percent of their principal and mayb e paid interest up to 15 to 20 percent of the principal.    Fidelity Investmetns, through a variety of its mutual funds, owns about $500 million of these loans, enough to control the fate of the restructureing; Fidelity paid 55 cents on the dollar for its position. Trust Company of the West owns about $100 million. No other investor owns more than $50 million, investors said. G.E. Warehouse Financing: $53.2 million    A loan from the GE Credit Corporation at 10.44 percent, secured by warehouse distributution centers; equal in seniority to the other secured loans above, but not presently for sale. Unsecured Debt    In theory, these creditors get paid only after the secured creditors are satisfied. But since they can try to block a restructuring, unsecured creditors often receive some equity or cash. 3. Senior Subordinated Bonds    The most senior class of bonds. Likelyto receive a substantial piece of the restructured company's stock. Omega Advisors, Odyssey Partners and T. Rowe Price are all reported to hold significant stakes in this class. Traded at 50 cents on the dollar yesterday, up from 42.5 cents Friday. 4. Subordinated Bonds    Holders of these may also receive some stock. Traded at 24 cents on the dollar yesterday, up from 19 cents Friday. 5. Junior Subordinated Zero Coupon Bonds    More of a long shot for stock distribution. Apollo Advisors inherited a large position in these from Executive Life. Traded at 8.75 cents on the dollar yesterday, up a cent from Friday. Stockholders    Stockholders' claims on a bankrupt company come last. New stock in a reorganized company may be used to satisfy higher-ranking creditors' claims. 6. Preferred Stock    Three series split between approximately 16 holders, the largest of which are GE Credit and Loews Corporation. Preferred stockholders, along with management, make up Macy's present board. They are not likely to receive any distribution. 7. Comon Stock    Entirely owned by 325 members of management. These shares are now worthless, but owners mayget something out of the bankruptcy distribution to retain their loyalty to the company.

They toured around the world 80 times and grew accustomed to Balenciaga creations, caviar and Dom Perignon. The beautiful LaSalles weren't just a name","excerpt":"they were a way of life. Emmy had the \\"highest kick in the Continent.\\" \\"Ageless goddesses\\" one reviewer called them. And so on. So we're told.    Real theater, however, is not in the telling, and \\"The Beautiful LaSalles,\\" at the Crossroads Theater Company, is a series of tellings and retellings, with no evocation of glamorous times or glittering talent.   In Michael Dinwiddie's play, Emmy and Nanny are well past agelessness. Living together, forgotten, amid reminiscenses, scrapbooks and resentments, in a Harlem apartment in 1980, Nanny, still shipshape, has desperate visions of a comeback, but Emmy, walking with a cane after a mysterious illness, won't hear of it.   Mr. Dinwiddie's plot might feed a soap opera for years, but it can hardly sustain a two-hour play. In the first act, he has dragged in another old-timer, one Willie Lewis, who is better remembered than the LaSalles but, one is led to believe, not that much better. She's getting ready for her return to the big time in \\"Blues on Broadway,\\" a revue in which there just might be a spot for the sisters, but both, not just one.   But Emmy will not speak to Willie. Hasn't for 50 years. In the first act, which trades on reiteration, we do not learn why. In the second act, which is crammed with supposed revelations, we do learn why, and just why we didn't care in the first place.   Mr. Dinwiddie's crude characterizations and less than mundane writing, which is filled with confounding lines like \\"Who do you know who's made it through life without getting hurt?\\" and \\"The older you get the more things matter\\" are hardly redeemable. Perhaps a stirring production could disguise such flaws, but this one, directed by Ellyn Long Marshal, is not haunted by the necessary ghosts. It remains stuck in the apartment, in spite of between scenes period voices (Ivie Anderson, Lena Horne and the jazzy onstage piano playing of Jimmy Justice, who has the foolish role of a downstairs neighbor).   It's too bad that Emmy (Ethel Ayler) is reduced to scowls and tantrums. She shreds pages from a scrapbook and rips up a contract. The accomplished Ms. Ayler can do little but be disagreeable. In the play's closing scene, she is allowed a moment of reverie wherein the actress imparts a certain radiance that signifies a potential performance and a talent wasted.   And it's hard to tell whether the affectations of Essene R. as the pushy, neurotic Nanny are rooted in the director's permissiveness or an actor's frustration. Betty Vaughn, as the dottering, drunken Willie, offers a too oft rehashed caricature. Lee Dobson as the smooth, two-timing Cliptoe gives the only performance suggestive of a bygone era.   None of the actors are chronologically convincing. In what seems to be a wholly misguided and puzzling effort, perhaps the makeup artist should be held accountable for that.   What is clear is that \\"The Beautiful LaSalles\\" was inspired by legend. Avon Long and John Bubbles, the late hoofers, were, respectively, the father of the director and a cousin of the playwright. One would have expected a play steeped in the spirit of a golden age, not a lot of domestic twaddle about a pair of chattering sisters, fussing and feuding.      \\"The Beautiful LaSalles,\\" a play by Michael Dinwiddie produced by the Crossroads Theater Company, 320 Memorial Parkway in New Brunswick.

But I don't think any of these friends have ever been in a band. If you've been in a band, you get the joke. Jack Black and Kyle Gass made their first Tenacious D minimovies for HBO in 1997","excerpt":"they were about a two-man group of wildly egotistical losers who played sparsely attended open-mike nights at a sleepy bar and proclaimed themselves the Greatest Band on Earth. From a distance they appeared to be working the antischtick, playing the ineptitude card. But the trick of the D is, um, eptitude. I mean to say that they're good musicians, good enough to express love for the music they were mimicking, which was anything heavily mannered in '70s or '80s pop, whether that be late-period Black Sabbath or Prince.    The years went by, and now here they are with a movie, ''The Pick of Destiny,'' and -- it would have seemed quite unbelievable in 1997 -- a gig at Madison Square Garden. In a stroke of inspiration, the D has chosen the comedian NEIL HAMBURGER as its opening act. Mr. Hamburger is like a punk W. C. Fields: his mean-spirited act is all about failure and revulsion, and it's sometimes not funny at all. And if you feel for him, this is when he reaches a sacred space beyond humor.

In ancient times, \\"the ups and downs of women's rights had to do with how important to the culture and the economy their textiles were,\\" Dr. Barber said. Four thousand years ago, women in Mesopotamia, for example, sold textiles for gold and silver. The women pictured above are shown gathering saffron to use as a yellow dye.

As the debate and confusion persist over what a man should be, the toilers in ambergris and musk have succeeded in realizing -- not in a 200-page tome, or two hours of celluloid, but in the whiff of a scent strip and the flick of a photo, or at best, in a 30-second spot run back to back with breakfast cereal -- the archetype for our times: the ideal man, fully formed (if not necessarily fully clothed). It is their unique mandate to cull the mostly inarticulate desires of fragrance buyers and distill them into scent and image. Because at least 50 percent of the customers are women, this creation, this Adonis, must be the hero every man longs to be and every woman longs to be with.   This didn't use to be a problem. In the 50's, men wore after-shave, not fragrance","excerpt":"they were all dads who received this after-shave on Father's Day.

Using the French composer's perspective, the city of Seattle is more than halfway there, and a new production of this 1902 work by the Seattle Opera does indeed go halfway toward Debussy's goal of having the opera stand apart from usual expectations.    Gone from the stage are any hints of the preciously symbolic and mythic world of Maurice Maeterlinck's play. There is no forest, no castle, no well, no courtyard, no tower. Instead, each set consits of an abstract sculpture by Dale Chihuly, the reknowned artist in glass: tubes and protuberances, rippling plastic, enormous curved disks speckled with red and green and blue. These objects, sometimes twice the height of the singers, are all meant to look like the glass Mr. Chihuly used to construct the original models","excerpt":"they were also all meant to add to the Symbolist quality of this work, amplifying its mixture of Art Nouveau imagery and unexplainable allusion.
