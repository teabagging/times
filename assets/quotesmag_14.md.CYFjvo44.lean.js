Segreti, who gained 113 yards in 18 carries, ran for touchdowns of 10 and 17 yards and caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Tom Ciaccio. Lockbaum, who gained attention for playing offense and defense, set the school record from 1983 to 1987.   Holy Cross (8-1-1 and 4-0) will play at Colgate next Saturday to decide the league title.

What Mr. Baker seems to have discovered five trips later, though, when Syria finally accepted the American peace conference proposal, is that he was right about the window of opportunity but wrong about what had opened it. It was not the end of the gulf war. It was the end of the cold war.   More than any other Arab regime, the Syrian Government led by President Hafez al-Assad has been a creature of the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Syria lived off the cold war for three decades, milking billions in economic and military aid from Moscow in return for being its most loyal Middle East ally and for allowing the Soviet Navy to use Syria's Mediterranean ports, from which it could better compete with the United States Sixth Fleet. The Syrians could always count on the Soviets to protect them from the Americans in the diplomatic sphere, and to rearm them after every war with Israel.

When the Lebanese Army, for example, sought to move into the Shuf Mountains overlooking Beirut, it ran into fire from Druse militiamen who have long claimed the mountains as their stronghold. Druse leader Walid Jumblat still sees the army as essentially a hostile Christian force despite its recent reorganization. Complicating matters, a helicopter crash last week killed the army chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Nadim el-Hakim, a Druse, and seven other officers. Although the army described the crash as an accident caused by fog, Mr. Jumblat spoke of assassination at the general's funeral yesterday.

If we are to speak of moral discernment - of the ways in which human behavior can be scanned and graded - no American painter has rivaled Eakins either in the quality of his insights or in the grave stringency with which he set them down on canvas.
