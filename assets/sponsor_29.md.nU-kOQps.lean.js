Soviet integration into the international economy has to signify much more than a stake in a stable world order.   When we look at today's wrecked Communist command system amid empty stores, inflation and rapidly declining gross national product, it is easy to forget the Soviet Union's strengths: tremendous agricultural territories, enormous natural resources (including huge petroleum reserves), a huge pool of literate and skilled workers, and a powerful scientific and technological establishment.   The transformation will be lengthy, uneven and worrisomely uncertain. Nevertheless, a worldwide economy in which, with luck, a healthy Soviet Union (however renamed) becomes a major player will be radically different. The three-cornered love-hate competition among the United States, Europe and Japan will open up to all sorts of new combinations and permutations. Whether the goal is to undercut Persian Gulf oil dominance, to embark on new collaboration in space or to initiate major new technologies, a revived Soviet Union will alter global behavior patterns and business alliances.   The United States can, along with sounder domestic policies, revive its competitive fortunes even as the Soviet Union revives its own. While imaginatively helping the Soviets on their journey, we should not forget the main future promise for ourselves. DAVID E.

Its scenario concerns the gentleman farmer Meyhofer, a tyrant and drunkard, who, with his crazy schemes, brings his family to poverty. Out of pure jealousy he hates Baron Douglas, the present owner of his former estate, and when his farmhouse is set on fire by a dismissed worker he accuses the Baron of the deed. When the court does not support his charge he decides to take revenge himself. At midnight he leaves his cottage with the intention of burning the house of his supposed enemy. His son learns of his intent and pursues him across the moor. The old man loses his way in the darkness and is swallowed up by quicksand before the eyes of his helpless son. Later this son marries the daughter of the Baron, and we realize that the mother is to spend the end of her days in peace and comfort.Robert Land shows himself a director of virility and subtle nuance. Fritz Kortner as old Meyhofer plays with restraint and power","excerpt":"allow me to repeat, he has developed into one of the big character players of the international film world. Wilhelm Dieterle and Grete Mosheim were completely what their rôles demanded.Mary Carr was brought all the way from America to play the rôle of the mother. If it helps to sell the film in the United States, it was financially undoubtedly a wise move. Artistically speaking, there was no crying necessity for it; two or three German actresses I can think of could have played the rôle with greater fidelity to German character. But Mrs. Carr is a player of sorts and lends the part her sincerity and human charm.A Grand Guignol Affair.OF a quite different genre is \\"Alraune.\\" from the novel by Hans Heinz Ewers. Aimed straight for the gooseflesh, it strikes directly into the centre of the target. The plot is one that would make Edgar Allan Poe hang his innocent head in shame. By a process which I am much too wary to recount here, a scientist brings into being Alraune, the daughter of a hanged criminal and a street walker. When the girl grows up she learns of her origin and determines to revenge herself With devastating vamperie she does the scientist in. Having extracted all money and joy of life from him, she runs off with the leading juvenile The scientist expires in a conveniently neighboring gutter.If you like this sort of thing you'll find it a superior product. Heinrich Galeen has directed with phototographic imagination—no question that the picture has atmosphere Paul Wegener does what he can with the conventional rôle of the scientist; Ivan Petrovitch is an acceptable leading man and Brigitte Helm is Alraune. All the promises of \\"Metropolis\\" are here fulfilled. To the vampire gallery, which runs from Theda Bara to Greta Garbo, let me add the German Brigitte. She lacks Greta's delectable weakness but she gives in its place power and depth. A most engaging evening's display of erotics.Mysterious Criminal Yarn.SOMEWHAT the same, only less so, is \\"Spione\\" (Spies), the last Fritz Lang.Some seasons ago Lang turned out a picture called \\"Dr. Mabuse,\\" which at that prehistoric period seemed quite breathtaking to me. But in this day and age to make a slavish imitation of that picture is another brand of celluloid. \\"Mabuse\\" was taken from a novel by Norbert Jacques, \\"Spies\\" is an original scenario by Lang's wife, Thea von Harbou. Yet again a mysterious criminal whose identity is never disclosed is finally captured by the police after a long and fantastic battle. The trimmings are anything but new. Lang makes his leading crook the director of an enormous organization housed in a skyscraper—an organization whose only work is the stealing of diplomatic documents. Need I remark that this, instead of increasing the tension, makes the plot seem merely ridiculous? At the first earthquake of reconsideration it falls together with a fine crash.To this add that Lang's direction is commonplace. I found no moments in the film which were personal. Kleinrogge, as the master criminal, played without exaggeration but with a vacuum of emotion or power—incredibly empty. Lupu Pick, Willi Fritsch, Gerda Maurus and Lien Deyers are good enough, but little more.Without waving the flag unduly, these little things are put together several times more cunningly in the suburbs of Los Angeles, Cal.

With four days left in the legislative session, it is time for the Albany crowd to kick in the afterburners and address these crucial issues:    Lobbying. We have said it before and will say it again: Lobbyists must be required to register when pitching a state contract to a government agency, just as they are when selling a new law to the Legislature.    Gambling. Gov. George Pataki has proposed only one new casino in the Catskills instead of the five that had been threatened. The gambling den proposed at Kutsher's Sports Academy in Monticello is the least troublesome environmentally, but as with all gambling ventures, the odds will eventually turn against everybody but the casino owners. Some legislators are pushing for three casinos. Even one is one too many.    Voting. Election officials are desperate for Albany's help in figuring out how to use federal funds from the Help America Vote Act. Any legislative package should focus on new optical-scan machines that leave a verifiable paper trail, and avoid voter identification procedures that have the effect of excluding legitimate voters. Voters should also have enough time to get back on the rolls if they are bounced because of some small mistake. Also, voting must be administered in a fair and bipartisan way by the State Board of Elections.    Campaign Fund Raising. It's time to ban gifts from lobbyists to legislators and prohibit fund raising in Albany when the legislature is in session. Even more important would be computerizing and centralizing state campaign finance data (some counties are still in the typewriter age).    Ethics. The State Senate is the holdout on an important change in the ethics law. The change would close a loophole that allows a state employee to evade most ethics charges by simply resigning from the job.     Also on our wish list are bills that would expand the state's bottle redemption bill to include water and other beverages","excerpt":"allow pharmacists to dispense emergency contraception; and make sure that more of the money set aside for charity cases in New York hospitals actually goes to the people who need it.

Looking Ahead"},{"year":"1996","title":"The Allstate Corporation, the nation's biggest publicly traded home and automobile insurer, said yesterday that its quarterly earnings more than doubled from a year earlier, mainly because of sharp growth in auto premiums and a decline in catastrophe claims.         Allstate posted net income of $397 million, or 88 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $163 million, or 37 cents a share, in the corresponding 1994 quarter.

A $2.7 billion loss in 1992 from Hurricane Andrew in Florida and a $1.3 billion loss from the Los Angeles earthquake early this year have wreaked havoc on Allstate's profits. After a loss of $500 million in 1992, the company saw profits jump to a record $1.3 billion in disaster-free 1993, but earnings have slumped to $320.7 million in the first nine months of this year.

While an average of 48 percent of the unemployed collected benefits in 1982, the figure fell to 39 percent in 1983, 37 percent in 1984 and now hovers around 33 percent, according to the Department of Labor. In 1975, the average was 69 percent.   You note stricter eligibility requirements, along with a changed work force, as major causes for the 35 percent decline in the numbers using the unemployment insurance system, but you omit another obvious cause: long-term unemployment, coupled with fewer weeks of benefits available. The drastic reduction in the number of benefit weeks from a high of 65 weeks (not 52, as you state) in 1975-77 to 26 weeks has rendered the unemployment insurance safety net increasingly irrelevant to millions of jobless Americans. More than two million workers exhausted all benefits last year","excerpt":"almost 200,000 in New York alone. Though these workers are counted as unemployed, they do not receive benefits.   Your assumption that sentiment against higher taxes could automatically lead to calls for further limits on unemployment benefits also ignores the basic point that wage-earning taxpayers do not pay for the unemployment insurance system. Funded by a tax on employers, unemployment insurance is considered by wage earners as an indispensable benefit and not a tax. If anything, unemployment insurance has lagged far behind other taxation. As the taxable wage base for Social Security has risen over the years from $3,000 to more than $54,000, the Federal wage base for unemployment insurance taxes has only gone from $3,000 to $7,000.   This is now the fourth recession we have had in just 15 years. The fundamental issue is society's ability to provide decent-paying, secure jobs for all able to work. But the immediate question is whether or not we can afford    not    to protect the jobless; the issue is priorities, not just finances.

Much of the writing is ''brilliant","excerpt":"almost all of it is marked by a gentleness of spirit,'' Fareed Zakaria said here last year.      THE STATEMENT   By Brian Moore.    William Abrahams/Plume, $11.95.    Pierre Brossard is a Frenchman with a past -- a past involving not only collaboration with the Vichy Government during World War II but also the murder of Jews. For decades he has evaded justice, but now his pursuers are closing in. In a novel inspired by the real-life flight of Paul Touvier, Moore shows how Brossard's situation reflects the moral ambivalence of both French politicians and the Roman Catholic Church. In 1996 our reviewer, Eugen Weber, described the book as ''a straightforward shocker, a psychological thriller, a chase and travelogue through France, a religio-political conundrum -- any way you take it, this is first-class fare.''     THE ART OF THE NEW YORKER, 1925-1995   By Lee Lorenz. Knopf, $25.     It is ironic that a magazine whose reputation rests on literary quality should be so prized for its cartoons. But Lorenz, who has edited them for almost 25 years, shows just why they have become an art form. His book ''informs and delights,'' Ben Yagoda said in these pages in 1995. One of The New Yorker's legendary contributors is examined in JAMES THURBER: His Life and Times, by Harrison Kinney (Owl/Holt, $19.95). It discusses Thurber exhaustively, from his love of dogs to his misogyny to his eventual blindness. Yagoda, also our reviewer for this book in 1995, said of Kinney that ''one tends to trust his thoroughly researched conclusions.''    WORST FEARS   By Fay Weldon. Atlantic Monthly, $12.    What, indeed, could be worse than finding out that your husband has died and that he has been unfaithful and that none of your friends are to be trusted? This is the predicament confronting Alexandra Ludd, an actress. Weldon has ''filed down a few sharp edges in 'Worst Fears,' and that makes it one of her best novels yet,'' Karen Karbo wrote here last year.     GEOGRAPHY OF THE HEART: A Memoir   By Fenton Johnson.   Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.    This is a love story about two men: the author, a novelist, and Larry Rose, a teacher who died in 1990 of complications from AIDS. Johnson reflects on the years before they met as well as on the life they shared. He ''marries his eye for detail with graceful writing,'' Ted Loos said in these pages in 1996. An abbreviated life is also celebrated in WINTER'S LIGHT: Reflections of a Yankee Queer, by John Preston, edited by Michael Lowenthal (University Press of New England, $14.95). In these essays Preston, a journalist who succumbed to AIDS in 1994, writes of an unassuming childhood in Massachusetts, followed by an awakening and years of activism in Portland, Me. ''He leaves behind a splendid road map for anyone seeking a balanced and dignified life,'' Charles Kaiser wrote in the Book Review in 1995. YOUNG MAN FROM THE PROVINCES: A Gay Life Before Stonewall, by Alan Helms (Avon, $12), describes a journey from a repressed and bitter Midwestern childhood to an intoxicating but empty whirl in New York. Helms's cautionary tale is ''one to heed, one to read,'' Steven Bach said here in 1995.     SLEEPER SPY   By William Safire. St. Martin's, $6.99.    If anything could awaken a sleeper spy, it's the fall of his Government. Thus in 1989 a Soviet mole in the American banking industry is suddenly sought by various Russians and two American reporters. ''There doesn't seem to be anything in the realm of word and image that William Safire can't do,'' Morton Kondracke wrote in these pages in 1995.     THE GIANT'S HOUSE: A Romance   By Elizabeth McCracken. Avon, $12.    Librarians are often stereotyped, and Peggy Cort, the narrator, at first fits the mold: stern, unmarried, more tender toward books than people. But then she falls in love with a doomed, outsize young man. ''McCracken unpacks her metaphors with the intensity of a poet,'' our reviewer, Diana Postlethwaite, wrote last year.     BEAMING SONNY HOME   By Cathie Pelletier.   Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.    Mattie Gifford's son is on television, but it's nothing she can brag about: he's taken two women and a dog hostage in a trailer. And Mattie, a widow in her 60's, has to face the biggest crisis of her crisis-filled life. This novel is ''both funny and unexpectedly moving,'' Ruth Coughlin said in the Book Review last year.     THE FREQUENCY OF SOULS   By Mary Kay Zuravleff. Penguin, $11.95.    Radio waves carry interesting messages, and Niagara Spense is sure that some of them come from the dead. But it's her own kookiness that haunts her mild, married office mate, George, like an old song. Their romance makes for an ''engaging first novel,'' Janet Kaye wrote here in 1996.

And it is this purpose that is explicitly denied by the radicals who see this knowledge as serving to perpetuate our sexist, racist, capitalist society, and who want to replace this kind of inquiry with the pursuit of knowledge that serves the interests of those who, they claim, are excluded from our society.

I had often contemplated returning to the valley to sample the season's pleasures, but had been deterred by the price. Renting a car from New York for three days costs almost $200, and even if you take the train to Springfield for a mere $51 round trip, you need to rent a car to reach the Five College Area. Amtrak offers service to Amherst as well, but the train, on its way to Montreal, stops in town at 2:40 A.M., and leaves for New York at 1:15 A.M.\\n\\nLast month, though, I called the Peter Pan bus company and learned that the round-trip fare between New York and Amherst is $37.95, with about 10 departures a day. The Amherst Chamber of Commerce helped me find a small local concern called North Amherst Motors where I reserved a car for $29.95 a day, and provided me with a list of lodging options, including the venerable Lord Jeffery Inn right on the town common, with 50 handsomely appointed rooms that rent for $80 to $120. As I was looking for something less expensive, I called several bed and breakfasts in the area and booked three nights in three different private homes for $40 to $65.

It is a lazy, strained narrative to which Frank Tuttle, the director, has not imparted any great degree of imagination. It might justly be alluded to as a plain case of undershooting the intelligence mark of movie audiences, for spectators in the Paramount Theatre yesterday afternoon willfully laughed when it was intended that they should weep, or, at least, have a lump in their throats.\\"Blind Alleys\\" is a special screen contribution from the pen of that prolific playwright, Owen Davis. It is concerned with a South American girl being alone in New York, owing to her husband meeting with an automobile accident. Not much is made of the young bride's experiences, or, for that matter, of those of Captain Dan Kirby (Mr. Meighan). Hence it is a tale that would be tedious to any but those intimately associated with the character.Throughout this photoplay Mr. Tuttle is guilty of a series of the most obvious touches. He sees to it, for instance, that it is as plain as the proverbial pikestaff, or the nose on one's face, that Captain Kirby, before leaving his hotel suite, neglects to take with him any means of identification. Kirby stresses this by saying that he won't need his pocketbook as he is going to cash a check. It is through another man dropping a card-case that Kirby meets with an accident on Broadway. He is taken to a private hospital without being identified and then has his own experiences and those of his pretty wife. Another girl intercepts a note from the bride, and here again Mr. Tuttle shows that he wishes to have it plainly understood that Kirby is sooner or later going to throw away an empty cigarette package and then discover his wife's name on the communication that was alleged to be an automobile advertisement.Mr. Tuttle also wants to have it quite clear that Kirby and his wife, Maria, are very much in love. He has a kissing and cuddling sequence that is not overwhelmingly interesting. Then Mr. Tuttle is meticulous in displaying the surgeons operating on Kirby, and in the closing scene of the story he delivers his surprise, which is not exactly clever.You have Kirby hastening in a taxicab to reach the pier from which his wife is to depart in thirty-five minutes. Mr. Tuttle has Kirby's vehicle stopped by traffic and eventually by the inevitable freight train. The steamship is depicted ready to leave, and one wonders whether Kirby will reach the pier in time. No, he can't, for the hawsers are slipped and soon the vessel is in midstream. It is a tired, despondent Kirby who stands on the pier. He knows that the steamship has gone, but he does not know that the kindly Mr. Tuttle has arranged that Maria did not leave on the vessel after all. This ending moved the audience to vociferous mirth.Mr. Meighan is convincing as the injured man, but when he tackles the idea of endeavoring to restrain his impatience it is not satisfactory. Evelyn Brent figures as the jealous girl. Greta Nissen, in a dark wig, plays the part of Maria, and she does the best she can in the circumstances.A colorful stage contribution from Frank Cambria called \\"An Alpine Romance\\" precedes the film feature.

It began, surely, with the Four Seasons, the now-classic monument of modern design by Philip Johnson in the Seagram Building on Park Avenue. When the Four Seasons opened in 1959, suddenly there was a restaurant that was as carefully orchestrated a work of architecture as any museum, that had as precisely detailed an interior as any corporate headquarters.

Their trial for murder was entering its third week when the Millen brothers, Irving and Murton, and their accomplice, Abraham Faber, were arrested in New York and confessed to the Lynn crime. The cab drivers were exonerated. Faber and the Millens were executed.This is the factual basis for \\"Let Us Live,\\" a taut and strongly played drama which Columbia presented at the Globe yesterday with such anonymity that the credits refer only to \\"a story by Joseph F. Dinneen,\\" not even mentioning its title, \\"Murder in Massachusetts.\\" The unofficial explanation from Hollywood was that the Commonwealth preferred not to be reminded of its near-miscarriage of justice and had threatened action of a vague but unpleasant nature if the film so much as implied any inefficiency or harshness to its police, its prosecutor or its courts in the case of the unfortunate cabbies.Actually, of course, Massachusetts need not be so sensitive","excerpt":"almost every State has had a near-tragedy of that sort, and Hollywood has celebrated scores of them ranging all the way from the lynching of Edward Norris in \\"They Won't Forget\\" through the attempted lynching of Spencer Tracy in \\"Fury\\" to the last-minute pardon of Harvey Stephens in the Strand's current \\"You Can't Get Away With Murder.\\" At this late date it could hardly be called a daring theme or an indictment of anything or any one—except, usually, of the script-writers and players for the routine treatment the plot normally gets.But \\"Let Us Live\\" is a notable exception. Under the goad of John Brahm's forceful and eloquent direction, it explores its familiar theme with anything but contempt. Mr. Brahm is as alert as any director of Class B melodrama to his opportunities for swift and exciting action, to the inherent suspense in a death-house deadline when a clock is ticking away the swift last hours of an innocent man's life, to the frenzy of the condemned's sweetheart as she tries to convince officialdom that justice has not been done. But, instead of stopping there, Mr. Brahm has underscored his physical drama with the psychological. What, after all, must happen to a man who finds himself victimized by a legal machine which he always had regarded as his protector? That is the essence of Mr. Brahm's drama, the quality which raises it above the death-house thriller class and gives it dignity and maturity.Although it is the film's direction that has made it good, if not great, Mr. Brahm must share his credit with Allen Rivkin and Anthony Veiller for a splendidly turned script, and to Henry Fonda, Maureen O'Sullivan, Ralph Bellamy, Alan Baxter and the others for the incisive performances all good directors seem able to extract from their players. \\"Let Us Live\\" is not exactly a novel theme, but it is news when so old a theme has been handled so well.

Survival also means the modest, faltering steps the not-dead take toward the resumption of everyday normal life.   Based on an autobiographical novel by Robert Bober, a French writer and filmmaker who worked as an assistant director on a handful of early Francois Truffaut features, &quot;Almost Peaceful&quot; opens in the summer of 1946. In an upstairs apartment on an anonymous Parisian street, Albert (Simon Abkarian) and his sad-eyed wife, La (Zabou Breitman), are raising  two young children and running a modest tailoring shop where most of the employees are other survivors. Amid the warm, enveloping hum of steady work and clattering machines, Jews who survived the death camps work side by side with Jews who evaded their horrors, fashioning a new world for themselves stitch by careful stitch. &#151; Manohla Dargis After the Death Camps, Life Goes On, Step by Step"},{"year":"1962","title":"IN the fifth inning of a game against the Kansas City Athletics a fortnight ago, Jack Kralick, the Minnesota Twin pitcher, made a discovery.

By Lisa St. Aubin de Teran. (Franklin Watts, $15.95.) This disturbing novel of mystery, obsession and madness begins symbolically in Sestri Levante, a strange haven on the Italian Riviera also called ''the two-faced place.'' There a promontory divides two bays, the Bay of Fairytales and the Bay of Silence, which gives this novel - Lisa St. Aubin de Teran's fourth - its title. The novel, like one of its two main characters, is ''obsessed by twos,'' by truth and secrets, by speech and silence, by madness and dual and dueling definitions of reality. Twins, alter egos and schizophrenia add to the double weave of the book's fabric. The story is told in alternating narratives by a husband and wife who first honeymooned in Sestri Levante 13 years earlier and return to put their fractured lives back together. William is a graphic designer whose bitter childhood taught him that ''rock bottom is always lower than you think.'' Rosalind is a beautiful, strange and dreamy actress who ''grew up used and abused and neglected","excerpt":"almost starved by affluence.'' As an adult she becomes promiscuous yet detached, floating in a ''sea of non sequiturs,'' her dual nature alternating between a need for stability and a need for change. The couple have twin girls and then a baby son. The infant's mysterious death coincides with his mother's schizophrenic breakdown, and leads to the troubling climax of the book. All the details of menace and decay are told in a voice of confidence and control that is distinctly this novelist's (her previous novels include ''Keepers of the House'' and ''The Slow Train to Milan'').

We \\"have the luxury to build that which we can't really use,\\" explains Kenji Kawakami, a former cartoon scriptwriter, bicycle museum designer and home shopping magazine editor who now devotes himself to subverting the Japanese obsession with gadgets and technology. His latest book, 101 UNUSELESS JAPANESE INVENTIONS: The Art of Chindogu (Norton, paper, $10.95), may also subvert the American notion that he and his countrymen are conformist robots, lacking the genes for whimsy and anarchy. A Chindogu, as Mr. Kawakami puts it (with the help of his translator, Dan Papia), is an almost useless invention, something that looks as if it's going to make your life easier -- and only succeeds in making it more ridiculous. Like the hay fever hat, a roll of paper tissues that sits snugly on the sufferer's head, fresh sheet dangling handily just above eye level. Or the golfer's practice umbrella, equipped with a club head at the tip,  perfect for chip shots on a subway platform. Admittedly, some Chindogu may speak to distinctly Japanese social needs: consider, for example, the sweetheart's training arm, an extra appendage that attaches to a coat or jacket, recommended  for \\"the early stages of courting\\" to avoid \\"the worry of sweaty palms, inappropriate pressure or when to disengage.\\" Then again, what married woman of  any nationality hasn't yearned for the back scratcher's T-shirt stamped with a handy \\"itch-locater grid,\\" the perfect garment for a demanding mate? Or, better  still, the dust and shake, a combination duster and martini shaker that rewards  vigorous cleaning, providing a truly fine incentive for tackling room after room after room.
