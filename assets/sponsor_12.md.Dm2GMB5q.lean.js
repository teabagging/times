It is her contention that the pioneering work done in Paris in the mid-19th century repositions that time as the central chapter in the development of photography, the medium most associated with modernism.

TO an Easterner, the central visual expression of Los Angeles may be the beaches, or the bungalow sprawl, or Hollywood, or smog","excerpt":"to an Angeleno, the dominant visual experience is the freeway. Not only do these roads constitute a grid that channels virtually all traffic and sets many communal boundaries; they are, being elevated, the platforms from which one sees the city. Moreover, since they are the primary form of transportation for almost all residents, they provide the common experience for those residents and thus the source of much of what it means to be a Southern Californian.  In this subtle, thoughtful, informative essay, David Brodsly, a native of the city and a student of urban design, interprets the meaning of the freeway system, explains its history and offers some stimulating comments on whether something better was ever possible or may become possible in the future. Though Brodsly says he grew up hating freeways, his book will offer little comfort to those who see the freeway as the embodiment of America's commitment to the automobile gone mad, as evidence of the ruthless exploitation of the environment, or as the enemy of sensible mass transit. In truth, I think, Mr. Brodsly grew up not so much hating the freeways as enjoying them but feeling guilty about his enjoyment. He set about studying them to find the reasons for that guilt and discovered it was unjustified. THE CITY OF ANGELS AND AUTOS"},{"year":"1996","title":"WILLIAM M.

I want a debate over issues and an argument over ideas, and I will stand on my record, and I won't let that Arkansas Governor run away from his record, either.   You know, I think the American people have a right to know what they're buying into because, remember, if you buy what candidate Clinton is selling, there's no refund, there's no rebate. Actually it's more like a permanent payment plan, and I don't think we need that for the United States of America.    On one issue, and I think it's the fundamental issue in this campaign, my opponent and I have just agreed to disagree. It's a question of how our economy grows and how our country works, and it's kind of like 'Jeopardy.' It all comes down to how you ask the question. And my opponent asks, what makes the economy grow? And his answer, and look at his program, is government planners and projects and programs.    And I ask, who makes this country grow? And my answer is you, the individual working men and women, building and buying a freedom of the market.\\"  GOV. BILL CLINTON    In a speech yesterday in Columbus, Ga.    \\"There are people like that all over the world who are struggling to develop the capacity to have nuclear technology","excerpt":"to be able to drop chemical weapons; to be able to drop biological weapons on their people, on other people.    We cannot risk that happening. So there are significant challenges to us in the world we are living in. What does that mean? I conclude that it means we need not so many people in uniform as we used to have. We need not so many people in Europe as we used to have, because the Europeans don't face the imminent threat of a large Soviet Army marching across Eastern Europe into Western Europe. We need not so much money spent on the space-based portion of 'Star Wars,' but we do need to focus on greater training and mobility of our forces, on land, in the air and on the sea; and on maintaining the enormous technological lead we have in the development of both tactical defenses and defensive weapons.   Which means we have to maintain a strong infrastructure of technology in this country. And we have to continue to train, equip, and work with our military forces at a smaller level to make sure they are still the strongest, the best, and now the most mobile in the world, hopefully being able always to be used in cooperation with our allies.    That is the defense plan I have put forward to the American people in this election. It will require us to spend less money that we are now spending. But I think it will give us a stronger national defense than Mr. Bush's proposed budget.\\"  VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE    In a speech at a rally yesterday in Fort Worth, Tex.     \\"As the case of military service makes most clear, these differing positions are, in fact, more than mere flip-flops. They reflect a fundamental element of Governor Clinton's character: the triumph of expediency over principle, of convenience over truth. Governor Clinton says he is the candidate of change, but he truly is the changing candidate.    Don't get me wrong. If you are in public life, sooner or later some variation will creep into the record. Sometimes, leaders genuinely change their minds or they may alter course in the best interest of the nation. It's one thing to take a political risk in the hope of helping your country. But it's another matter to change your position to avoid political risk in the hope of helping yourself.    One lesson we've learned over the past two centuries is the need for strong character in our Presidents. This country has prevailed in rough times when our leaders have adhered firmly to principle and truth. But when our Presidents have vacillated or lied or attempted to be all things to all people, then we have lost national confidence and steered toward crisis.\\" In Their Own Words"},{"year":"1937","title":"Says internatl silver agreement may not be renewed TREASURY REDUCES APRIL 14 BILL ISSUE","excerpt":"To Be About $50,000,000 Instead of $100,000,000 as Usual in Offerings"},{"year":"1941","title":"To close because of financial difficulties","excerpt":"to be absorbed by St John's Univ Law School N.

Son John disappoints Pop; he is killed in World War II. So son Chip - a fighter pilot who was shot down in the war but survived as a P.O.W. - becomes the title character of ''The Good Son,'' Craig Nova's fourth novel. In this dark, deep story of a father and son who love (and love to fight) each other, the good son is the one who will defeat, or even kill, his father with the father's own weapons.   I've read no better, no more bitter and ironic understanding of professional cunning and ambition since Joseph Heller's ''Something Happened.'' I've read no fuller mixture of human frailties, no more deft revelation of the chinks in moral armor since Robertson Davies's ''Leaven of Malice.'' I've read no more comic and painful exploration of the disasters of loneliness since Nabokov's ''Laughter in the Dark.'' As a virtuoso handling of first-person narration, ''The Good Son'' is as marvelous as Andre Brink's recent ''A Chain of Voices.''
