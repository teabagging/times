The Federal Government sets general guidelines and pays 56 percent of the costs on average, the states the rest.    Costs are zooming, with no end in sight. Medicaid took 3 percent of state spending in 1970, but 12 percent of state spending in 1990. Medicaid outlays have been climbing by 12 to 15 percent a year and in 1990 by an astonishing 18 percent, far above the inflation rate.    The growth reflects many factors: a general rise in medical costs, federally mandated expansion of eligible groups, an increase in the number of poor people who qualify as the economy slows and pressure to raise the low fees that are paid doctors and hospitals. One major driving force is the aging of the population. Already, nursing home care and related expenses, mainly for the elderly, take half of Medicaid funds. These include both poor people and middle-income people who have seen their assets drained by nursing-home costs or have transferred their assets. Unless a new way is devised to support long-term care needs, Medicaid costs will climb relentlessly.    The governors have condemned Congressional expansions oof coverage and other rules, which require them to come up with ever greater matching money. But defenders of these mandates say that improved coverage of poor children and pregnant women is an important social goal that can only be met through Medicaid until broader national reforms of health care are achieved.      WELFARE    Welfare, while still a major item in state and local budgets, has accounted for a smaller share of spending over the last two decades, in part because the real value of benefits has shrunk. The Federal government pays an average of 55 percent of the costs of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the major nonmedical program","excerpt":"states, which have discretion in setting benefit levels, pay the rst. The Federal Government pays the entire cost of food stamps.    A.F.D.C. began in 1935 but was limited until the 1960's when court decisions required states to cover families who met Federal eligibility requirements. The welfare rolls increased steadily, from 3 million recipients in 1960 to 11.4 million in 1975. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan tightened eligibility requirements, which reduced the number of beneficiaries, mostly the working poor, by 8 percent. Enrollment crept up and has jumped with the recession, but remains close to the 1981 level of 11.2 million recipients.    While states vary widely in their benefit levels, from 1970 to 1990 the average monthly grant per recipient grew from $183 to $383. But this was far below the inflation rate, and purchasing power delcined by 39 percent. Total A.F.D.C. payments in 1989 were $17.5 billion.    Food stamps made up for part of the loss, but the average decline in purchasing power of the combined benefits over the two decades was still 19 percent. Federal spending on food stamps in 1990 was about $15 billion, providing an average montly benefit of $59 to 19.9 million people including all A.F.D.C. recipients.    Financial woes have undercut the ability of states to reform their welfare programs. States have come up with enough matching money to qualify for only 65 percent of the $800 milion in Federal money to pursue welfare reforms.       PRISONS    Spending on corrections - prison building and maintenance, parole and related costs - has nearly doubled during the past decade. The cost has been almost entirely borne by state and local governments, which spend $17.9 billion in 1988, for example, while the Federal Government spent only $1.1 billion.    Corrections, the biggest criminal justice expense after police costs, represents only 3.5 percent of state spending on average, but in some states with ambitious prison building programs, like Michigan, it now absorbs over 7 percent of the budget. And though it takes a relatively small bite, corrections spending has grown at an average annual rate of 13 percent since 1986, absorbing much of the growth in state revenues.    The flurry of prison building is less a reflection of rising crime than of changing public responses to it. From 1976 to 1985, according to a Federal study, the number of reported crimes actually declined 2 percent, though the number of reported violent crimes rose 19 percent. But there has been a shift in public attitudes away from rehabilitation toward punishment, an increase in mandatory sentences and a broadening of the definition of criminal activity to include such things as drunk driving and possession of weapons. Even as the prison population jumped, court cases forced many state and local governments to construct new prisons to relieve crowding.    The nation's overcrowded prisons and jails hold over one million inmates and the population is increasing at the rate of 2.650 per week, or enough to fill five average-sized prisons. Financial crises are forcing many states to search for alternatives to imprisonment, and new construction may taper off. But the prison expansion will have an expensive legacy: Housing inmates in new prisons costs up to $25,000 a year.       EDUCATION    Education is the biggest item in the budget of every state, typically accounting for one of every three dollars flowing out of state treasuries. Over the last decade, as states sought to improve education and direct more money to poorer districts, state and local spending on elementary and secondary schools more than doubled, to $187 billion in 1990 from $89 billion in 1980. Federal aid, at $13 billion in 1990, accounts for only a small fraction of school money.    The launching of Sputnik by the Soviet Union in 1957 prompted Congress to invest in the teaching of math, science and foreign languages, and in the 1960's Washington increased support for disadvantaged and handicapped students. By 1980 the Federal share of school spending reached 9.2 percent, but during the 1980's it fell to 6.3 percent.    While local governments have traditionally borne the costs of schooling, usually based on property taxes, over the last two decades the state governments have taken on a greater burden, with the state share of total spending rising to 50 percent in 1990, from 40 percent in 1970. Three major forces were at work. Lawsuits have challenged the primary reliance on the property tax, arguing that this discriminated against districts with low property values. Many states have responded by increasing aid to local districts. Second, in the 1980's, states tried to make up for declining Federal assistance.    More significantly, states have recently accelerated their efforts to improve schools, raising curriculum standards and teacher salaries.

Still, amid a strong push for more hiring of members of minorities -- including job fairs and increased proselytizing about the newspaper business, the percentage of minorities remained little changed.    The annual data the industry compiled showed a slight increase in minority representation among the 55,100 journalists working in the nation's newsrooms.

The Park Service recommends arriving a half hour in advance for the first ferries, which leave Battery Park in lower Manhattan or Liberty State Park in Jersey City every half hour starting at 9:30 A.M. (although the recording incorrectly says 9:15). Because the park closes at 5:30 P.M. and the boat ride takes about 45 minutes, the last ferries from the parks to Liberty Island leave at 3:30.   Once on the island, visitors can visit a museum tracing the history of the statue's construction and restoration, and take the elevator to the top of the statue's base.

Suffice it to say that the tear-drenched, rudimentary acting of the principals, serious though it may be, only serves to point up the obviously maudlin aspects of this rickety vehicle.It is irreverent, perhaps, but somehow necessary, to note that Boubouca, an uninhibited undulating cooch dancer, who does her turn in a night-club scene, and Mimi Fotopoulos and Christos Efthimiou, a couple of comics vaguely reminiscent of Abbott and Costello, lighten the dreary but transparent drama.Mme. Kyveli, who is referred to as \\"the great\\" in the program notes, is not, to be perfectly charitable. As \\"Madame X,\\" she only indicates that a woeful mien is sad to behold. Vana Filippidou, who is Mme. Kyveli's daughter in private life, plays her as a young woman, and she, too is capable of looking woeful. Her actual grandchild, Kyveli Theochari, shows that she, at least, can be cheerful in a few scenes as her son's sweetheart.Alekos Alexandrakis, who portrays the son, does well in the trial sequences, although he tends to overact in the final deathbed scene.

Memoirs are generally exercises in revelation. Dole's is a study in reticence. By his studiously self-deprecating account, he was a decent athlete, a below-average student, and -- after joining the Army's fabled 10th Mountain Division in World War II -- a mediocre lieutenant. It is only after he is horrifically wounded on the Italian front that we begin to get a hint of the strength that helped Dole ascend almost to the pinnacle of American politics, or a flash of his bone-dry wit. (''The mere thought of being back on American soil sent electricity through me,'' he writes of his time in a hospital bed encased in plaster. ''At least, I think it did.'') It took more than a year of agonizing physical therapy before Dole could even stand again, and months of operations to allow him to so much as hold a pen in his battered right hand. But the moments of intimacy -- as when Dole confesses that to this day he cannot bear to look himself in the mirror, save to shave or comb his hair -- are rare. The politician's opacity in his writing frustrates true revelation.       SUNSET LIMITED: The Southern Pacific Railroad and the Development of the American West, 1850-1930. By Richard J. Orsi. (University of California, $29.95.) By the early 20th century, the Southern Pacific Railroad composed the world's largest transportation system, with tracks that ran from New Orleans to Portland, Ore.","excerpt":"steamship lines that extended beyond America's shores; and a reputation as ''the major sponsor of graft, and the primary obstacle to government adaptation and reform'' in the American West. Orsi's revisionist account argues that in fact the company was instrumental to California's conversion into the breadbasket of the region. It supported policies designed to encourage small-scale farming at the expense of mining interests and speculators, not as ''mere public relations ploys'' but out of enlightened self-interest: getting the land into the hands of those who would cultivate it most aggressively was the best way to spur development and make the railroad more profitable. This account is dense and encyclopedic, but Orsi has a good eye for stories, like the one he tells about the ''evangel trains,'' schools-on-wheels that brought cutting-edge agricultural techniques to small farmers around the state with an air of ''religious revival.''
