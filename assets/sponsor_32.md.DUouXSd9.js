Hair, for example, tends to get stringy and limp as a result of the sweat, oil and dirt that accumulate during a workout and requires frequent washings and stylings which can be damaging if not done with care. Skin, under the combination of heat, trapped perspiration and snug exercise clothes, can erupt in rashes and acne.     Sweating, of course, is the body's way of lowering temperature - a natural reaction to the buildup of heat that takes place whether you're exercising or just out in the hot sun. In the process, water, salt, ammonia and a number of other metabolic wastes are drawn to the surface of the skin. During an hour of heavy exercise, as much as a gallon of perspiration can be secreted, some experts say. As this liquid evaporates, it helps cool the body.

The brother of the star film comedian is beheld variously wasting a great deal of soda water and then pretending to be in the affectionate embrace of a wax dummy. These ideas, it seems, have served-somewhere before in an effort to provoke fun. Judging by the occasional laughter in the Hippodrome yesterday, this is a film for children up to eight and for some men not younger than eighty. Here nobody has to think and you can exchange a few words with your companion and then look up to discover Sydney Chaplin squeezing a banana into a glass or signifying by the most dexterous movement of the nostrils that two eggs have seen better days. This mechanical comedian also has a new game, which he exhibits during a sequence concerned with the Firemen's Bazaar.Helene Costello figures as the attractive girl in this film.

Mr. Persson is undoubtedly fat enough, at any rate, and he and his associates are joining hands to tell an hour-and-a-half joke that in any language, including subtitled Swedish, requires no more than ten minutes.The joke, as written by Ake Ohlmarks and Margit Beckman, has a lazy dairyman sauntering into Russian-occupied territory and rescuing his imprisoned son. Mr. Persson waddles roguishly past all obstacles, beguiling the top echelon, including an incredibly simple-minded general and his aide, with a steady stream of folk songs and ballads. In fact, he has only to grin or warble to circumvent the Russians, and there Mr. Persson may have something. But his cheerful expansiveness, the crawling pace, and the rattling amateurishness of the whole affair suggest that the director, Emil A. Lingheim, must have slunk off the premises at the outset. Spectators who don't emulate him will have to swallow Mr. Persson whole in one jolly lump and like it. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Swedish Import Arrives"},{"year":"1953","title":"The sole excuse for the new Swedish import at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse, for those who can take it, is the amiable, roly-poly presence of the Scandanavian Burl Ives, Edvard Persson. Precisely as has happened in a couple of predecessors, he ambulates majestically through this little romantic comedy, just as casually labeled \\"Each Heart Has Its Own Story.\\" Again, Mr. Persson expansively applies a sturdy baritone to a nice, generous batch of folk ballads, roguishly clears the way for a pair of lovelorn youngsters and single-handedly cements the frail structure of the entire offering with his tonsils.Furthermore, this A. B. Europa Film, released by Scandia Films, Inc., has been written and directed by Bror Bugler with an overwhelming emphasis on sweetness and light, as the rest of the cast trail the rotund star at a reverent distance. It's just too bad an accordion squeeze wasn't applied to the material as a whole and a little spice added. There are pleasant ingredients.The roast pig succulence of Mr. Persson's features and demeanor suggest a considerable amount of latent mischief. Also, Inger Juel and Carl-Henrik Schildt manage to make the sweethearts pristine and quite captivating at the same time. Snatches of the dialogue are quite droll, too, as when Mr. Persson reminisces with an old flame. And since the star is supposed to represent a country squire of some hundred years ago, the familiar incidents unfold against some fetching interiors and landscapes. It's high time, though, that Mr. Persson be permitted to park that halo and waddle through some pure devilment.

And while the logo on the outside of the truck may evoke quaint tales of a colorful past, the need for such a service should not be taken lightly.   Fire and insurance officials are becoming concerned about the rise in the number of residential fires related to the growing use of wood-burning stoves. According to John Weiss, supervisor of fireincident reporting for the office of the State Fire Marshal in Meriden, there have been 38 fires so far in Connecticut this year that were directly attributable to wood-burning stoves. And the peak period for these fires is only now approaching. November is estimated to be the month when most occur, equaled only by February.   The primary cause, said Sergeant Weiss, is the lack of chimney maintenance, particularly inadequate and irregular cleaning. When the level of creosote, the flammable deposit of ash, carbon and condensed steam, exceeds one-quarter inch, say experts, a chimney fire can break out at any time. And because these wood stoves burn at relatively low temperatures compared to an open hearth fire, such a buildup occurs more rapidly than most people anticipate.

Cafe SFA     Saks Fifth Avenue, 611 Fifth Avenue, at 50th Street, eighth floor (212-940-4080) -- This recently opened full-scale restaurant is one of the most comfortable hideaways on the midtown shoppers' circuit. The dining room is expansive and attractive, with polished wood wainscoting, well-distanced tables and fabric-covered banquettes. For those on the run, there is a spacious wooden counter -- one might consider that option, for on a recent visit table service was as slow as Fifth Avenue traffic during the holidays.    Cafe SFA is more ambitious than most department store dining spots.  It has a varied menu and stocks eight changing wines by the glass. Appetizers include cream of carrot and dill soup","excerpt":"sweet corn-and-crab-chowder; crab cakes and assorted salads. Main courses might be scallops Provencal; roasted half chicken with herbs; fettuccine with chicken, broccoli and ginger; and roasted tuna steak with fresh herbs. Assorted sandwiches are served as well as entree salads like salade nicoise, shrimp platter; seafood salad; and Oriental chicken salad. For dessert there is citrus poundcake, cheesecake, apple harvest cake, chocolate walnut pie and more.    Appetizers are $4 to $9.50; main courses $8 to $14. Sunday service from noon to 5 P.M. (Visited Dec. 4, 1990.) Le Cafe     Barneys New York, 1067 Seventh Avenue, at 17th Street (212-929-9000 ext. 216) -- A curving marble staircase in the Women's Store takes you to this sparkling subterranean cafe.  The mirror-wrapped room with colorful terrazzo tables, pine green banquettes and a reflecting pool in the center -- ringed with poinsettias at this time of the year -- is a good place to stop for an espresso and pastry.   On Sunday an a la carte brunch is served. Among the options are strawberries and Devon cream, souffleed apple pancakes, shirred eggs in a pastry shell, eggs with smoked bacon or country ham, and eggs Benedict. Salads and pastas are featured during the week. Sunday hours noon to 5 P.M. (Visited Dec. 3, 1990). Le Train Bleu     Bloomingdale's, 1000 Third Avenue, between 59th and 60th Streets, sixth floor (212-705-2100) -- This charming reproduction of a 19th-century luxury French dining car instantly transports you away from the chaos of Christmas shopping just steps away. The long, handsome compartment has big, comfortable upholstered chairs for weary shoppers, overhead compartments for coats and packages, a moderate noise level and a view of the 59th Street bridge.     A small wine selection is available.  During the week the menu features entree salads and appetizers like grilled swordfish with orange and ginger; grilled filet of beef with peppercorn sauce; and calf's liver with bacon, mushrooms and pearl onions.  On Sunday an a la carte brunch is served. Entrees include grilled salmon, steak and eggs, omelets, grilled shrimp, and grilled breast of chicken with a mixed salad. A glass of champagne is offered with the meal. Entrees range from $16 to $18. (Visited Dec. 4, 1990.)  Cafe American Style     Lord & Taylor, 424 Fifth Avenue, at 39th Street, fifth floor (212-391-3000) -- This pleasant, matronly looking tea room would not look out of place in a film from the 1950's, with its floral wallpaper, matching floral banquettes, and waitresses in frilly red and white outfits. The fare is simple and familiar: salads, hot and cold sandwiches, soups and the like. Many of the desserts are made in house.  Specialties include chocolate cream pie, apple pie, fruit cobblers and chocolate layer cake.    Appetizers are $3.25; main courses $5.75 to $7.25.

It's not a typical love song.   This tension between sophisticated imagery and brusque electric guitar clatter is a key element in the Chills' chemistry. At Maxwell's, Mr. Phillipps seemed a bit like a mad rock scientist: his short brown hair was disheveled, his gray sweatshirt didn't fit quite right and when the tempos raced his eyes took on a look of manic distraction.

Was that really Mr. Branagh being unflatteringly upended, or was some double brought in to endure the manhandling? ''Oh, I was definitely the sack of potatoes,'' Mr. Branagh said with a laugh. Giving a convincing portrayal of a man who has no use of his legs required a good bit of learning on Mr. Branagh's part, some of it done at Warm Springs, the natural wonder in Georgia that, in Roosevelt's time and now, drew people seeking some measure of healing from the mineral-rich water. Staff members and clients schooled him in things like how a person with no abdominal muscle strength would swim. ''People were unbelievably generous as I was in there trying to pretend how to walk with leg braces and they were there with their leg braces and having to deal with very practical issues,'' he said. ''People seemed very keen that we get it right.'' The film, which has its premiere Saturday at 8 p.m., depicts Roosevelt's struggle to regain his sense of purpose after he was stricken by polio in 1921, just as his political career was about to hit high gear. Cynthia Nixon (above, with Mr. Branagh) plays Eleanor Roosevelt, who had adjustments of her own to make. Mr. Branagh, who is Irish, said he had some trepidation about portraying an American political giant. ''What made it seem more doable,'' he said, ''was the idea that this was a sort of secret part of F.D.R.'s life and that in fact I wasn't playing the great American icon, I was playing the man who then developed into the great American icon.''
