The indigenous nomads of the area around the river La Plata resisted Spanish intrusion, which began with the first founding of Buenos Aires by Pedro de Mendoza in 1536. Argentina was part of Spain's Viceroyalty of Peru until reforms in the Bourbon dynasty and a need to defend against Portuguese encroachment from Brazil led to the formation of the Viceroyalty of La Plata, including Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay, in 1776. Following the relaxation of trade restrictions two years later, Buenos Aires grew from a small town to a city of 50,000 by 1800. A provisional junta of the Provinces of Río de la Plata was established in 1810 after the Napoleonic occupation of Spain, and in 1816 the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata declared their independence. After independence the question of political relations among the United Provinces was settled by a federalist solution in which the provinces dissolved into a number of practically independent republics. In 1824, a constituent assembly created the office of president, first held by Bernardino Rivadavia. However, the failure to ratify a workable constitution caused Rivadavia to resign. Juan Manuel de Rosas became governor of Buenos Aires in 1829 and presided over the construction of a federal agreement between the provinces in 1831. Rosas governed Buenos Aires with an iron hand until his expulsion in 1852. The other provinces formed the Argentine Federation, based on a federal constitution of 1853, but Buenos Aires refused to join. Buenos Aires and the Argentine Federation entered into war (1859–1861) but reached an agreement on the inclusion of Buenos Aires in the Argentine Republic in 1862. Argentina joined Brazil and Uruguay in a war (1865–70) against Paraguay. During the latter part of the 1870's, the government took the initiative against the indigenous populations of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, which were partitioned with Chile. Immigration from Europe, especially Spain and Italy, resulted in enormous growth. In 1869, there were 2 million inhabitants; by 1914, 8 million; by 1955, 19 million; and by 1990, 32 million. The Argentine military, led by Lt. Gen. José F. Uriburu, ousted the civilian government of the Radical party in 1930 with the intention of following the European model of politics. In 1946 Juan Domingo Perón won the presidential election and constructed a populist political alliance that included workers, industrialists, and the armed forces. The Perón-inspired populist ideology of justicialismo included extension of the franchise to women and redistribution of income to workers and the poor. The activities of Perón's charismatic wife, Eva, bolstered justicialismo through her effort to distribute goods to the poor through the Social Aid Foundation. Tied in with Perón's populist strategy was his policy of nationalist economic development, whereby state-led development was financed through extraction of capital from the old export-agricultural elite and politically supported through populism. The Perón government incurred great expense to gain control over foreign-owned economic infrastructure, including railway systems, telephone companies, and dock facilities. A number of events led to Perón's downfall in 1955. The market for Argentine goods deteriorated after World War II. As Perón shifted his strategy to encourage foreign investment and impose economic austerity, repression against the political opposition grew. The death of Eva Perón in 1952 robbed Perón of an important political resource, and when the government challenged the Catholic church on a number of issues, the military ousted Perón. After a brief period of military rule, in which an attempt was made to roll back “Perónismo,” Arturo Frondizi of the “Intransigent” faction of the Radical party won the presidency in 1958. In the following years, the military repeatedly attempted to keep the Perónistas from returning to power. In 1962 the military forced Frondizi to annul Perónist victories in provincial elections and removed him from office. Pres. Arturo Illia was ousted from office in 1966 for the same reason. A military bureaucratic authoritarian regime led by a series of Argentine officers was established during 1966–73. Extreme violence by factions on the Left and Right led the military to accept Perón's return to the presidency in 1973. Perón died the following year, and his third wife, Isabel, replaced him but the military removed her in 1976 in the midst of economic and political upheaval. Determined to deal with what they saw as a leftist threat, the armed forces launched what was later called the “dirty war,” during which up to 20,000 people disappeared and were never heard from again. The authoritarian government collapsed after the 1982 Falkland/Malvinas Islands War against Britain led to the resignation of the junta and the holding of elections. Raúl Alfonsín, of the Radical Union party, was elected president in 1983. In 1989, he was succeeded by Carlos Saúl Menem, who agreed to take office early, in the midst of an economic crisis during which inflation reached 3,000 percent and foreign debt $58 billion. Menem encouraged free enterprise and good relations with the U.S. Government controls on foreign investment and trade were relaxed, and the government sold off many state enterprises. In 1993 Argentina's 11-year debt crisis officially ended, and by 1995 inflation was down to 4 percent. In 1995 the government introduced an austerity plan to fight the budget deficit and to cushion the shocks of Mexico's devaluation. As Argentina's economy began to flourish, Menem was reelected, and his party won majorities in both houses of the legislature and control of more than half of Argentina's provincial governments. But in May 1997, violent protests erupted in several major cities, as unemployment rose to nearly 20 percent. In October, the Peronistas lost control of the Chamber of Deputies, for the first time since 1983, to a left-wing coalition known as The Alliance. Presidential elections in October 1999 brought the first-ever Peronista defeat, as Alliance's Fernando de la Rúa defeated Eduardo Duhalde, while further Alliance legislative victories brought them within five seats of an absolute majority in the House of Deputies. Throughout 2000, the rather fragile Alliance managed to move gingerly to fight corruption, to reform certain privileges of organized labor, and to balance the federal and state budgets. This was sufficient to gain a pledge from the I.M.F. and other international lenders for a $40 billion bailout, but by the middle of 2001 the recession had grown worse and the government put a severe austerity plan in place. Strikes and rioting at last drove de la Rua to resign in December, and his successor, interim president Rodriguez, resigned after only a week. A second interim president, but with a two-year term, was chosen by Parliament: Senator Duhalde. His decoupling of the peso from the dollar and its subsequent devaluation brought some relief but no solution to the crisis. Only a January 2003 roll-over by the IMF prevented a third major default, private investors and the World Bank having been stiffed earlier. In the 2003 presidential election Menem withdrew from the run-off, leaving the presidency to Duhalde's protege, Nestor Kirchner.
