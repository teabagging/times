For main courses, steak au poivre is always pleasing. Other dishes include roast chicken with french fries, a notable, slightly spicy steak tartare and calves liver with grilled onions. On the lighter side, try the Nicoise salad, with tuna, green beans, potatoes and more, or the assembly of greens, apples, walnuts and Roquefort.

Salads are a good way to begin, whether the sprightly assembly of grilled portobellos, tender spinach and sweet fennel or the generous plate of endive, watercress, Roquefort and walnuts tossed in a well-balanced vinaigrette. Other starters include black bean soup, asparagus vinaigrette and fried chicken wings. For main courses, the kitchen turns out a perfect calf's liver with steamed spinach and buttery whipped potatoes, nicely charred sirloin steak with crispy fries, grilled lamb chops with ratatouille, meatloaf with mashed potatoes and a good house burger. (Review: 8/19/88; revisited: 7/20/95)    LATTANZI *  (212) 315-0980; 361 West 46th Street; $$; American Express    A welcoming family-run restaurant in the heart of Restaurant Row, Lattanzi delivers fresh, tasty pasta and sprightly salads in a low-key setting. One of the highlights is a menu featuring the cuisine from the ancient Jewish ghetto in Rome. The best-known dish from that tradition is carciofi alla giudea, or tender artichokes sauteed with garlic and parsley. Other good starters include a tasty shrimp and arugula salad vinaigrette and a combination plate of eggplant that is first fried then marinated in a sweet combination of vinegar, sugar, olive oil and tomatoes. The plate also includes fresh mozzarella and suppli al telefono, a Roman specialty that is essentially a ball of mozzarella coated with a risottolike mixture, then rolled in bread crumbs and fried. Recommended pastas include porcini ravioli, and herby linguine with white clam sauce. Among the entrees are grilled lamb chops with rosemary and braised shanks of beef with polenta.

They were made in 1953, a year before the conductor's death. The second recording (Arkadia CDWFE 351; 12 CD's) was taken directly from the stage of La Scala in Milan, at performances early in 1950.   Both items affirm that Furtwangler's extraordinary incandescence in the German repertory was not necessarily a home-grown affair and could be transferred to orchestras foreign in more ways than one. Faced with the murky qualities of these recordings, however, listeners will need assistance in getting the point. A touch of faith helps some, a lot of prior knowledge even more.

And any movie that telegraphs its fondness for its cast automatically has something going for it that's rare in contemporary comedy; this isn't one of those movies in which most of the actors steer clear of upstaging the star. This spiritual decency, a handful of songs from the toddler days of MTV and a few other fillips of clear-eyed charm go a long way toward making up for the tiredness of the concept, a kid magically leapfrogging into the body of an adult. In this case, it's 13-year-old Jenna (Christa B. Allen), who's suffering through a miserable failure of a birthday.  When some magic dust that a friend gives her lands on her carefully moussed hair, she awakens from a nap as a 30-year-old version of herself (Jennifer Garner). As acted by Ms. Garner, Jenna has a coltish gawkiness that she never quite sublimates. The obvious laughs are wrung from the contrast of an inexperienced child in a mature body, as Jenna bobs through a world in which the supposed adults turn out to be more childish than she is. The performances give the movie more flavor and life than the situation, which often feels like pre-chewed Bubble Yum. — Elvis Mitchell Freaky Future: An Awkward Teenager Finds Herself Fast-Forwarded to Adulthood"},{"year":"1928","title":"Awards KING'S CROWNS WON BY 81 AT COLUMBIA","excerpt":"13 Gold and 68 Silver Awards Go to Undergraduates for Non-Athletic Activities.

Mr. Crystal's apparel business career spanned 35 years. During his college summers he began his career with the pushcarts on Seventh Avenue moving the merchandise from warehouse to retailer. After attending the University of North Carolina, where he played football and was ACC heavy weight wrestling champion, he entered the firm as a salesman. In 1968, David Crystal was brought public and sold a couple of years later to General Mills. After leaving the apparel industry, Mr. Crystal began a successful second career in the then new option arbitrage field where he managed money for family and friends for an additional decade. Mr. Crystal's two favorite passions were sports and flying. He founded the Westchester Pilots Association and spent countless enjoyable hours flying his Navajo. In sports, he coached youth leagues in Scarsdale, NY for 15 years. As a near scratch golfer, he won the Quaker Ridge Golf Club championship five times in four different decades. He was the first member to shoot below his age when he was 80 years old (by four strokes). Mr. Crystal gave generously to many different charities and was always there to lend a hand. His lasting legacy to his children included his belief that real honor lies in one's commitment to the endeavor. While the outcome may be in doubt, no level of preparation should be spared. Hard work would be rewarded and success had to be earned. Even in his last days, his major concern was his surviving wife, Luella of 60 years. This was as true a love story as can be found. In addition to his wife, Mr. Crystal is survived by his sister Beatrice Newman, his four sons, Robert G. Crystal Jr., Jonathan A. Crystal, Todd W.D. Crystal, Bruce P. Crystal and his only daughter Wendy C. Jacobi. In addition he leaves 16 grandchildren","excerpt":"13 great grandchildren with two more on the way. He lived a charmed life.

Burundi's population is divided between two ethnic groups, the majority Hutu and the minority, but politically powerful, Tutsi. The Hutu were the original settlers of the country and practiced agriculture; the cattle-herding Tutsi arrived several hundred years ago and established a form of feudal overlordship over the Hutu. The traditional government was monarchical, with a king (mwami) chosen from among a group of aristocratic families (ganwa). European exploration of Burundi began in 1858, and the territory was incorporated into German East Africa in 1899. Following World War I, the League of Nations (1923) awarded Burundi, along with neighboring Rwanda, to Belgium as a mandated territory. Belgian rule over the Territory of Ruanda-Urundi, as it was then called, continued under a U.N. trusteeship after World War II. Burundi became independent on July 1, 1962, as a constitutional monarchy under the traditional mwami. The country rapidly lapsed into political chaos. In 1966 Capt. Michel Micombero overthrew the monarchy and proclaimed a republic. A Hutu rebellion in 1972 against Tutsi political domination left 10,000 Tutsi dead; Tutsi reprisals in 1972–73 resulted in the slaughter of 150,000 Hutu. The Micombero government was overthrown in a bloodless coup, and on Nov. 1, 1976, Lt. Col. Jean-Baptiste Bagaza took control of the government. Bagaza was overthrown in Sept. 1987, and his successor, Maj. Pierre Buyoya, proclaimed a policy of nonalignment, seeking closer links with the West, while maintaining relations with Libya and the eastern bloc. Domestically, the government pledged to eradicate Bagaza's record of persecution of the Catholic church (62 percent of Burundians are Catholic) and to seek ethnic reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi, but renewed outbreaks of ethnic violence occurred in 1988. Buyoya led the country to its first free presidential elections in June 1993. Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, defeated Buyoya by a wide margin. But in Oct. 1993 Ndadaye was assassinated, as was his Hutu successor (April 1994). The succeeding regime of Hutu president Ntibantunganya, unsuccesful in forming a stable, ethnically balanced goverment, was overturned in a military coup (July 1996) which dissolved parliament, outlawed all political parties, and named Pierre Buyoya to return as president. Vowing yet another return to democracy after the end of civil war, Buyoya faced economic sanctions by the Organization of African Unity. Meanwhile, the complicated civil war was only worsened by Zaire's attempt to expel almost half a million Tutsi (the Banyamulenge people, settled south on Lake Kivi since the 18th century) in 1996. The Tutsi succesful self defense had the paradoxical effect of driving yet more Hutu (50,000) into Burundi—and almost half a million more into neighboring Rwanda. The civil war continued into 2000, with at least 200,000 dead, with 350,000 Hutu rebels “regrouped” into 50 camps, and with Burundian army involvement (unadmitted) in the Congo conflict. A promising peace accord, brokered by Nelson Mandela in Aug. 2000, collapsed in Feb. 2001 as the capital of Bujumbura fell to Hutu rebels. Government forces re-took it on March 1, and another accord again forged by Mandela was signed by all parties in July 2001. Based on a power-sharing arrangement for three years the new 14 Hutu/12 Tutsi cabinet began ruling Nov. 1. A year later (Dec. 2002) the rebel group “Force for the Defense of Democracy” signed a truce with the government and in April 2003 when (as agreed) Hutu Domitien Ndayizeye was sworn in as president. Yet in July rebels attacked the capital of Bujumbara, while fighting continued in provincial villages as the civil war entered its eleventh year.

In the next century many Arawaks were worked to death or killed by disease. The western third of the island was harassed by French pirates and was ceded to France in 1697. A slave revolt in 1791 led to abolition in 1794, and the island came under French rule the same year. Toussaint Louverture, an ex-slave, became governor-general in 1801, but he was deposed by the French. In 1803 a black army under Jean-Jacques Dessalines (Emperor Jacques I, 1804–6) and Henry Christophe (Henry I, 1806–20) defeated the French in 1803. Independence was declared in 1804. Under Jean-Pierre Boyer (1820–43), Haiti occupied Santo Domingo (which had been restored to Spain in 1808) from 1822 to 1844. The next century was marked by political instability and an increased U.S. business and military presence in Haitian affairs. From 1905 to 1947, the United States had direct or indirect control of Haitian finances, and from 1915 to 1934 the country was under U.S. military occupation. François “Papa Doc” Duvalier took power in 1957 and ruled Haiti with a stern hand. In 1971, he transferred power to his son, Jean-Claude (aka “Baby Doc”), whose regime was just as authoritarian. Most of Haiti's wealthy and educated population fled the country, leaving it the poorest and most illiterate nation in the Western Hemisphere. In 1986, the military ousted Baby Doc, and imposed a succession of short-lived but brutal and incompetent governments. In 1989, Supreme Court Justice Ertha-Pascal Troillot was named interim president, and in 1990, Haiti held its first democratic national elections ever. The winner of those elections was the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a 37-year-old Roman Catholic priest. But seven months into his five-year term, Aristide was overthrown in yet another military coup. Aristide fled to the U.S., which refused to recognize the junta and suspended aid to Haiti. But succesive trade embargoes by the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe only served to increase hardship among the poorest segments of the population. The junta leaders, propped up by Haiti's wealthy elite and by money from drug trafficking, began a campaign of violence against Aristide supporters, killing more than 3,000 of them. After months of threats, the U.S. invaded on Oct. 15, 1994, forcing the junta's resignation and reinstating Aristide as president. Aristide disbanded the army, replacing it with a civilian police force. In mid-1995, Aristide's three-party coalition, Lavalas Political Organization, won overwhelming victories; in December, the Lavalas candidate, René Préval, took 88 percent in Haiti's first peaceful presidential election since independence. By 1997 Lavalas and Pres. Préval had split. From June of that year, Haiti was without a government until Jan. 1999 when Préval announced he would rule by decree, and appointed his own prime minister. The U.S. and the U.N. ended their military mission in early 2000. Senate elections were held in May, giving 16 of 17 contested seats to Lavalas candidates. But in run-off elections held in July, opposition candidates and international observers refused to participate because of irregularities in the earlier election. In November, with the opposition and international monitors boycotting, the presidential election returned Aristide with 92 percent, while in remaining run-offs, Lavalas won all 9 Senate races and took 80 percent of the Assembly votes. When in March 2001 Jean-Marie Cherestal was sworn in as prime minister, his cabinet included some opposition members, though the opposition Democratic Convergence coalition had named its own “parallel” president a month earlier. After an attack on the presidential palace by 33 gunmen was thwarted in Dec. 2001, Aristide loyalists meted out savage reprisals to opposition groups (though the whole affair may have been staged). OAS-sponsored talks of the government with the opposition “Democratic Convergence” have gone nowhere. Haiti"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: western Asia.

The ancient history of Lebanon is essentially coextensive with that of Syria, of which it was long a part. The port cities of Tripoli, Tyre, and Sidon were important centers of the Phoenician empire. The parallel ranges of the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains, crowned with the country's famous cedar trees, enclose the fertile Bekaa Valley. The coastal cities became strongholds of early Christianity, later fragmented into numerous sects, including Maronites (Syrian Catholic), Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Syrian Orthodox, and others. The mountains of the south became the center of the Druze sect of Islam, while orthodox Sunni Islam dominated in the Bekaa Valley. Lebanon came under French influence in the late 18th century, as France claimed the role of protector of Syria's Christian community. France intervened in Lebanon in 1841 and again in 1860 when fighting between Maronite and Druze communities led to the massacre of many Christians. Under pressure from France, the Ottoman Empire granted some local autonomy to the Maronites of greater Lebanon. In the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, France was granted a League of Nations Mandate over the Levant States (Lebanon and Syria), ensuring French control of the Iraq Petroleum Company pipeline from Iraq to Tripoli. In 1926 Lebanon became a self-governing republic under the mandate, but internal unrest and anti-French sentiment continued. In June 1940 the French administration in Lebanon declared its allegiance to the Vichy government. British and Free French forces occupied Lebanon in June 1941 and declared it an independent republic; but France retained control, and full independence did not come until Jan. 1, 1944. Under a National Covenant in 1943, political power in the Lebanese parliament was apportioned among the nation's various communities. The president was always to be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim. This provided a workable formula for power sharing but also ensured that the national government would always be hostage to the considerable power of separate communities and clans. The years from the end of World War II to the early 1970's were a brief golden age for Lebanon. Beirut developed into a wealthy, cosmopolitan city, the center of Middle Eastern banking and trade, while agriculture and small-scale industry flourished in the rest of the country. A Syrian-backed Muslim uprising in 1958 had no significant impact; U.S. Marines landed in May 1958 to protect American interests and remained until October. By the late 1960's, however, Lebanon's stability was threatened by PLO attacks on Israel from refugee camps in southern Lebanon and by a shift in the country's demographic balance. Muslims had become a majority in Lebanon by the late 1960's and demanded a revision of the National Covenant, while Maronite Christians continued to cling to their position of political dominance. Throughout the 1970's, Palestinian raids from Lebanon into Israel brought Israeli retaliatory strikes in southern Lebanon. Israeli troops occupied southern Lebanon in 1978 and again in 1980. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict polarized opinion within Lebanon, inflaming anti-Western feelings among Lebanon's Sunni Muslims. Civil war broke out in 1975, with Palestinian and leftist Muslim militias battling militias of the Maronite community, the Christian Phalange party, and other groups. More than 60,000 died, and damage ranged into the billions of dollars. Syrian troops intervened in 1976, battling Palestinian forces in an attempt to restore the status quo. Arab League efforts to negotiate a cease-fire produced an unstable peace at the end of 1976, though Syrian troops remained in Lebanon. Fighting broke out between Syrian forces and Christian militiamen near Zahle on Apr. 1, 1981. Other groups joined the fighting in a general war of each against all. Israel staged commando raids against Palestinian positions in Tyre and Tulin. Israeli air raids on Beirut caused extensive loss of life and property damage. Israel invaded Lebanon in a full-scale air and sea assault on June 6, 1982, in an attempt to drive out the PLO. Israeli forces surrounded Beirut and began a heavy bombardment of the city. On Aug. 1, Palestinian forces withdrew from Beirut under international supervision. On Sept. 14 newly elected Pres. Bashir Gemayel, a Maronite Christian, was assassinated; Israeli troops occupied the Muslim quarters of West Beirut in response. With tacit Israeli approval, Christian militiamen invaded two refugee camps and slaughtered hundreds of Palestinian civilians. Beirut remained a battle zone in 1983, divided by the “Green Line” into Christian and Muslim sectors. Terrorist bombings were common. The U.S., France, Italy, and other Western nations stationed troops in Beirut in an attempt to enforce a cease-fire. Fifty people were killed when a bomb partly destroyed the U.S. embassy on Apr. 18; separate attacks on military installations on Oct. 23 killed 241 U.S. Marines and 58 French soldiers. Rashid Karami became premier with Syrian support on Apr. 26, 1984. The civil war continued, with fighting among various groups of Christian, Druze, Sunni, Shiite, and Palestinian militias. Kidnappings of foreign nationals at the hands of various terrorist factions became commonplace. War between Shiite and Palestinian forces broke out in May 1985. Israeli forces withdrew from most of Lebanon in June, but maintained a “security zone” in the southern part of the country. Premier Karami was assassinated on June 1, 1987, when a bomb destroyed his helicopter. At an October 1989 Arab League-sponsored meeting, Christian and Muslim leaders agreed on a new national charter. The Taif accord was condemned by Christian militants, led by Gen. Michel Aoun, and Muslim militia leaders. Newly elected Pres. René Mowad, a Syrian-backed Christian, was assassinated on Nov. 22 and succeeded by Elias Hraoui. In November 1990, rival Shiite militias—the Syrian-backed Amal and Iranian-backed Party of God—signed an agreement ending three years of fighting. In February 1991 Lebanese troops moved to defend the area for the first time in 13 years and called for Israel to abandon its “security zone” in southern Lebanon. In addition to leaving 150,000 dead, the civil war severely disrupted the economy, virtually wiping out the international sector and causing significant damage to the domestic sector. The government of Christian prime minister Omar Karami collapsed in May 1992, after riots protesting widespread economic hardship. New elections were held under Syrian supervision with Hizbollah and other Islamic fundamentalist parties gaining the most seats in the new parliament, in part because the Christian parties called for an electoral boycott. In early 1994, as Israeli-Hizbollah skirmishes continued in southern Lebanon, the government banned the Christian political party Lebanese Forces, arrested some of its leaders, and stopped all “political” broadcasts not government-controlled. In 1995, Syria-backed premier Rafik Hariri won a second term together with a 2-1 backing in Parliament. Although he sought to address economic reconstruction, he was hindered by repeated skirmishes between Israel and Hizbollah Shiite guerrillas in Israel's “security zone” in southern Lebanon. In April 1996 the fighting escalated as Israel launched 600 airraids and 24,000 artillery shells some of which hit a U.N. refugee camp near Tyre, killing over 100 and wounding 100 more. The U.N. voted 64-2 (with 65 abstaining) to condemn the attack. By the following year order had been essentially restored but no peace agreement reached with Israel. With $3 bil. in U.S. and E.U. aid the government set about to rebuild this ravaged land. The U.S. officially lifted its ban on travel to Lebanon in July 1997. Deadly skirmishes still occured in the “security zone.” In 1998 Lebanon held its first municipal elections in 35 years; no clear pattern emerged. In Oct., the (pro-Syrian) National Assembly unanimously elected General Emile Lahoud as president. He nominated Selim al-Hoss as prime minister after Hariri declined a fourth consecutive government. In 1999 the Israeli-Hizbollah warfare in south Lebanon intensified until, suddenly, Israel withdrew completely (May 24, 2000), accompanied by about 3,000 Christian militiamen of the South Lebanese Army to whom Israel offered haven. Apparently at Syria's behest, only a token force of Lebanese troops and police entered the border area, effectively under Hizbollah control. In early Sept. Hariri won a decisive victory in parliamentary elections. Lebanon"},{"year":"1957","title":"The printing industry in the New York metropolitan area set a record for dollar volume last year.

Sick of the endless process of developing plays that tie up work for years, these writers, who included Anne Washburn, Sarah Ruhl and Young Jean Lee, organized 13P, a company created to defend the much-abused playwright. Its shows put the control firmly in the hands of the writers, who are the artistic directors of their own work, casting it, choosing the director and helping find a stage. Forget about all those readings and workshops. 13P's slogan is, ''We don't develop plays. (We do them).'' Apparently, they weren't kidding. Despite the challenges facing the creation of any new play -- finding money and space, to start -- 13P has in the last month produced three new plays. (The plan is to mount one work by all 13 playwrights before 2010.) While displaying a diversity of style, subject matter and success, the shows all appear refreshingly undiluted and uncompromised, which can be a mixed blessing. Kate E. Ryan's ''Mark Smith,'' a raw mockumentary about the life of a 1980's pop star, could use some more shaping, and Gary Winter's ''At Said,'' which recently closed, was desperately in need of an editor's pen. But it's hard to argue with the success of Sheila Callaghan's appealingly ambitious ''Dead City,'' above, with Dan Illian and Elizabeth Norment. It is an uncompromising, melancholic riff on ''Ulysses.'' Perhaps the rough edges of the stylized, evocative language or motley crew of urban archetypes would have been sanded off in development. We should be glad they weren't. (''Dead City'' is playing at 3LD Art & Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, Lower Manhattan, through June 24.

It's a tiny place with heavy beams and a few tables and chairs. The very simple, straightforward menu includes paella for two, a faithful rendition made from Calasparra rice and Spanish saffron.    BARBUTO  (212) 924-9700; 775 Washington Street (West 12th Street); $; $25 and Under: 4/14/04.      The deceptively simple menu at this spare Italian restaurant changes daily and plays to the style of the chef, Jonathan Waxman, who lets seasonal ingredients shine.    THE BLUE MILL TAVERN  (212) 352-0009; 50 Commerce Street (Barrow Street); $$; Diner's Journal: 10/1/04.     The Blue Mill Tavern resurrects the name of the restaurant that preceded Grange Hall and inhabited this space on Commerce Street for about five decades beginning in the early 1940's. The menu offers $18-to-$21 blue-plate specials: a designated entree plus soup (or salad) and dessert.    GUSTO RISTORANTEE BAR AMERICANO  (212) 924-8000; 60 Greenwich Avenue (Perry Street); $$; Diner's Journal: 7/8/05.     What's on the menu is Italian, but Gusto gives it shadings and a showcase that it doesn't always get, like a delightful appetizer of fava beans with mint, escarole and pecorino.    EXTRA VIRGIN  (212) 691-9359; 259 West Fourth Street (Perry Street); $; $25 and Under: 9/8/04.     The menu at this little gem of a restaurant is Mediterranean, the cooking consistently good, and the young staff warm and efficient. The name is more than a flight of fancy. Every night there is a choice of two extra virgin olive oils for the ritual dunking of the bread.    WALLSÉ  [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 352-2300; 344 West 11th Street (Washington Street); $$$; Review: 5/5/04.     The chef, Kurt Gutenbrunner, uses vegetables and herbs wisely to offset the heft of Austrian dishes. The current menu includes crispy cod strudel with wild mushrooms and a stew of baby carrots and ginger.    YUMCHA  [Rating: One Star]  (212) 524-6800; 29 Bedford Street (Downing Street); $$$; Review: 6/8/05.     The name of the restaurant means ''drink tea,'' and the encouragement to do that comes in the form of unusual blends.
