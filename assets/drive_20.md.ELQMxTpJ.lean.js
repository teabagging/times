Looking at Chicago","excerpt":"Chicago"},{"year":"1981","title":"Ten years ago, or thereabouts, there arose among certain artists of the younger generation a strongly held conviction that art, in order to remain spiritually uncontaminated by the evils of a wicked society, must henceforth take only the most perishable forms. It was assumed, of course, that ours was an especially wicked society, and the whole notion of producing a durable art object, such as a painting or a sculpture, that would, if successful, take its place as a valued part of an established cultural tradition, was therefore rejected as a morally odious compromise with a corrupt and moribund system. Permanence in art was judged to be incompatible with the ideals of the social revolution that many of these artists professed to espouse.   To implement the desired new agenda for art - an agenda more in keeping with the values and outlook of the radical counterculture that had nurtured this rejection of permanence and ''success'' - various alternatives to the despised conventions of bourgeois art were quickly pressed into service. It was then that Conceptual art, earthworks, on-site improvisation, certain modes of video and performance art, and sundry other ''alternative'' movements of the period won their place on the art scene.

So one's first reaction to the latest crop of Chicago skyscrapers is that they don't belong here - that there has been some mistake, that they must have been intended for some other city.   But that is not, of course, the case - the half-dozen or so new buildings that are so completely changing this city's skyline were very much meant to be here, and what they proved is that Chicago, like the rest of the country, has moved away from the rigid orthodoxies of the International Style. The change from blank boxes to more eccentric skyscraper forms has been slower to come to this city than to most others, but it has now arrived in earnest.   Even Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the firm that has been the commanding presence in Chicago's commercial architecture for more than a generation, has been forced to change its tune. Skidmore's latest large building, a still-unfinished condominium tower on the near North Side with the pretentious name of One Magnificent Mile, is sheathed in granite, not the metal of its earlier Sears Tower and John Hancock Center buildings. And One Magnificent Mile's overall form is a bundle of sections with angled sides and sliced-off tops that creates a jagged, uneven profile on the skyline.

Springtime is glorious in Chicago, crisp and bright and new, a reward for outlasting the winter. This is not to say, of course, that there will not be snow flurries at Wrigley Field in April.
