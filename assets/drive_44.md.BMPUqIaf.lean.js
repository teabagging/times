Salisbury, who, with the assistance of Ernest B. Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper, is responsible for \\"Gow, the Head Hunter,\\" this present film and several others to come. Messrs. Cooper and Schoedsack will be remembered as the producers of \\"Grass\\" and \\"Chang.\\" Mr. Cooper furnished the titles for this current offering and Mr. Schoedsack manipulated the camera.The savage tribes, especially the Pygmies, afford quite a good deal of humor through their queer ideas. A sequence that tickled the risibles of the audience yesterday afternoon was one showing the black widows in mourning wearing either their late husband's jawbone or his skull slung around their necks. These particular small ebony men believe in letting out the devil in children and to do so they nip the flesh with a couple of clam shells. Judging by the innumerable small scars that dot the bodies of the adults they must have been incorrigible as youngsters.In some districts of Abyssinia it is questionable whether the debtor or the creditor has the worst of it. For in one decision handed down by a black Supreme Court justice, the debtor is sentenced to be shackled to the creditor, who must have thanked his lucky stars that only one man owed him coin of the realm.The coiffure of the dusky individuals receives attention by means of shears. Some of the males and females have their own ideas about attractive hair-cuts. There are those who like a firm suggestion of baldness and others who prefer to have a strip of thick hair on the centre of the skull.In Ceylon, Captain Salisbury and his friends photographed native entertainers. There is the man who charmed the hooded cobra and then there are other natives whose forte is sticking skewers through their necks and cheeks. After they succeeded in this none too pleasant task, their expression is hardly one of keen enjoyment.In Abyssinia there is a series of scenes that ought to have received more footage. It shows the Abyssinian warriors gathering from the hills and plains for manoeuvres, the chief feature of which is a wild charge in which the participants appear to become almost hysterical in their zeal to please the Emperor and his generals.These scenes were photographed several years ago, but like other films of this type they can stand the test of age.A Ufa piscatorial study, called \\"A Fight for Life,\\" is on the surrounding program. While it is by no means as exciting as \\"Killing the Killer,\\" the film, a battle between a huge lobster and an octopus, is worthy of attention. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Abyssinia, &c.

They were wrapped in white tissue paper, folded and pleated and sealed up in their pouch with a slightly neurotic precision that is characteristic of my father and that he inherited, I believe, from his mother, Irene, who wrapped everything, even the unpeeled oranges on her kitchen counter and the silverware in her drawer. He'd neglected to include a note or a card, but my 28th birthday is a week off and I took this package to be my gift from him.\\n\\nI unwrapped the first neat little bundle and found, in their clear plastic sleeves, four baseball cards, printed by the Bowman Gum Company in 1952, the year my father was 14. There was a Bobby Adams, and a Billy Goodman, and two pitchers named Howie, Judson and Pollet. I consider myself a baseball fan and a moderately accomplished student of baseball history, but I confess that I had never heard of any of these players. Thinking that I had inadvertently opened the \\"auxiliary\\" portion of my birthday present -- perhaps some duplicate cards of my father's (he's a collector) that he had thrown in as a kind of bonus -- I tore open the other bundle and found three more cards, also Bowmans, also in their archival plastic, PVC-free sleeves: a Mickey Harris, and a Vern Bickford, and then a Randy Gumpert.\\n\\nDespite the note of faintly derisive disappointment inherent in any sentence that ends in the word \\"Gumpert,\\" I was not at all disappointed in my father's gift. The 1952 Bowman cards are among the most serenely beautiful exemplars of a popular art form not notable, it must be admitted, for works of great beauty, serene or otherwise. The baseball card has generally and throughout its hundred-odd-year history been an object supremely suited for insertion into the spokes of a bicycle wheel. Though to the true fan any awkward old photograph of some square-jawed, walleyed fellow named Carlton Molesworth, in a peaked beanie, staring off into the outfield on some vanished sepia afternoon, may have a kind of poignant charm, and though some of the cards of the 1930's and 1940's, like National Chicle's Diamond Stars and those issued by the Leaf Gum Company, have a kind of flat, primary-colored crudeness that makes them look like so many tiny Warhols, most baseball cards are, as specimens of the photographic and design arts, at best uninteresting to look at and far more frequently outright ugly.\\n\\nThe 1952 Bowmans are different","excerpt":"accidentally, perhaps, they attain to a cool and evocative beauty. There is no printed text on the obverse of the card, for one thing, no goofy bird or injun or sock; there is only a small, simulated autograph -- say, \\"Randall P. Gumpert\\" -- modest, dignified, perfectly legible, stitched across the portrait of, in this case, a Red Sox right-hander.\\n\\nAnd the portraits themselves! The ballplayers have been depicted not in the usual glum mug shots, nor in the clumsy hand-drawn caricatures found on cards of earlier years, but in an odd combination of painting and photograph, photographs not merely tinted and retouched, but painted over, transformed. Blood-red Boston B's on caps, radium-white uniforms, dreamy, powder-blue, textbook skies -- all the colors run rich and surreal; the lace cornices of the stadium over the shoulder of Randall P. Gumpert are a luminous cake-icing green, his resolute mouth a jet-black cartoon line, and one feels that these are unquestionably idealized paintings of ballplayers. But all the men have been caught, in mid-windup, or after letting fly, or stooping to short-hop a grounder, as only a photograph can catch a man, with his mouth open, or his teeth clenched, or his forehead furrowed in candid anxiety over the location of this next pitch, or with his thoughts patently elsewhere, his eyes looking strangely lost and vacant, the way eyes can in photographs.\\n\\nAnd then, inescapably, you turn the card over. Because the great secret theme of baseball is Loss (and its teammate, Failure), reading the backs of baseball cards is always an exercise in pity, and this is particularly true of the reverse of an older card like a 1952 Bowman, where the details of a ballplayer's career are generally given not in the clean, bloodless statistical charts of today but in terse, prose paragraphs, where they take on some of the mighty sadness of narrative, and each card can become the tiniest of novels, whose plot is the familiar tale of futility and squandered promise and a ball club's giving up. Howie Pollet \\"began the 1951 season with Cards. In 6 games for them, with no wins and 3 losses. With the Pirates Howie took the mound 21 times, with 6 wins and 10 losses. Season's record: 6 and 13. Led League in 1946 with 21 wins. Had 20 wins in 1949. Broke into majors with Cardinals.\\" At the bottom of every card is the send-away offer of a baseball cap of your favorite major-league team (\\"a $1.00 value\\"), for five wax wrappers and 50 cents.\\n\\nThe thing is, I don't really collect baseball cards, and I think that my father knows this. During the winter of the 1990 lockout, just before my marriage ended, in the miserable grip of a Seattle January that consisted, without exaggeration, of 21 full days of rain, I dabbled in the hobby, out of a kind of desperate yearning for a season that, it then appeared, might never have its Opening Day. But I don't have the collecting temperament -- not the way my father has it -- and it's been over a year now since I bought my last card. But that isn't important.\\n\\nI have a little-used copy of Dr. Beckett's price guide, in which I can look up the values of the seven cards and see that my father's gift is a generous one. But that isn't important, either. That's what I'm thinking, anyway, as I pull down the copy of Macmillan's Baseball Encyclopedia that was my father's gift to me 22 years ago this week, and discover that Billy Goodman was actually a pretty good ballplayer who in 1950 led the American League in hitting with a .354 average, and that Vern Bickford, in the same year, pitched the season's only no-hitter.\\n\\nIt's not important that I neither collect 1952 Bowmans nor care, really, what they're worth, nor that when I'm finished turning each card over and over and wondering at that lost expression in Howie Pollet's eyes I'll probably just put them all away in my sock drawer and lose them for a while.\\n\\nWhat's important is the nature of the gift, is my father's saying to me, after 28 years during which we have lost Roberto Clemente and our beloved Washington Senators and my father's mother and father, and have split two divorces between us, and have known all the usual guilt and bitterness and recrimination, and have moved, in modern and terrible fashion, to opposite ends of the continent, \\"Here, son, have seven baseball cards.\\" What's important is that baseball, after 28 years of artificial turf and expansion and the designated hitter and drugs and free agency and thousand-dollar bubblegum cards, is still a gift given by fathers to sons.
