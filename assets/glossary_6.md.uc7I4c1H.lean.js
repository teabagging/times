The ''season of sweet savings'' is the label the Caribbean Tourism Association is giving this year to the period from April 15 through Dec. 15, the islands' off season. To minimize the number of empty rooms in these months, many hotels will cut their rates drastically.   A list of daily rates issued by the association gives examples. The Windward Passage in St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands will reduce its current minimum winter rate for a double room from $82 to $40. A one-bedroom villa, with modified American plan, at Frenchman's Cove near Port Antonio, Jamaica, will drop from $180 to $120. In San Juan, Puerto Rico, the price of a seven-night package at the Caribe Hilton falls from $395 a person to $290.   Many hotels will also be reducing their rates for snorkeling, windsurfing and other water sports activities. Some of the islands are offering such off-season sweeteners as one free night and a bottle of rum for seven paid nights (U.S. Virgin Islands) and a basket of spices, a recipe book and rum (Grenada).

At last, good news for children facing the bleak prospect of full-time day care in a \\"quality\\" setting. Even the most enthusiastic proponents of day care have acknowledged what mothers and educators have been able to observe: that while day care may free mothers to work, our children may be paying the price with their emotional and physical well-being.   Despite statistical evidence that would confirm the strong desire of mothers to stay at home with their children, we are subjected to a relentless campaign, in the name of all mothers, to establish a federally monitored network of utopian \\"quality\\" day care centers, which would free us of the burden of raising our children and enable us to join the work force (often in such satisfying capacities as clerks and checkout girls).   Sweden, cited in your article for its 90 percent rate of participation of women in the work force, has ceased to be a role model for child care among many American experts, and it is doubtful that American women aspire to the wholesale surrender of child rearing to the Government. Swedes themselves now voice doubts about their mass social experiment.   Once again, it sadly seems, the women's movement has taken its position behind the fun-house mirror, distorting the feelings of women to reflect an agenda geared to a distinct minority of individuals who remain untroubled by the implications of relegating the care of other people's children to paid care givers in the stressful environment of full-time day centers, albeit certified.   Working women everywhere would be grateful if some of the tremendous energy expended on this push for day care were channeled into devising a tax code that would not force mothers of young children to go to work just to pay the tax bill, but would enable them to choose, without jeopardizing their family's financial well-being, between pursuing a career and remaining at home with their children until they are ready to rejoin the work force.

It opened, aptly, at the World Theatre yesterday. If the skill, restraint and occasional power of this melodrama typify the films to come, may Grand Prize then hasten to send more.Marred somewhat by two rather obvious contrivances, this Meteor-Fama Production balances a particularly ugly subject with taste, compassion and impressive technical awareness. The subject is vice and the entrapment of the innocent, as personified by a renowned, morphine-craving ballerina, and her unwilling tools, a pair of blissfully wed pharmacists.Enacted by a gifted, unfamiliar cast, the story unfolds against a superlatively photographed background of present-day Salzburg. A festival performance of \\"Everyman\\" sternly underscores the incidents that follow, as the desperate addict loots the pharmacy and almost manages to blackmail the stricken couple into wholesale cooperation.The unfortunately devious and crabwise beginning, attributable to both director Rolf Hansen and scenarists Hans-Joachim Beyer and Tibor Yost, soon swings into a suspenseful second gear befitting a Hitchcock. And the climax, with the wife weighing a chance to do in the tormentor, provides a genuine emotional workout for the customer.For the unfortunates caught in the purely circumstantial web are an appealing, even literate group of adults who strike both mind and heart (one up on Mr. Hitchcock!).

The defending champion, Jay Haas, and Davis Love 3d each shot 65's, and Scott Gump, Michael Allen and Neal Lancaster shot 66's. Bradley, who joined the PGA Tour this year and has missed the cut in three of his last five tournaments, got off to a quick start with birdies on the first three holes and four of the first five. Haas won last year with a 21-under-par 263 and tied for third in 1991 over the 7,006-yard Tournament Players Club at Southwind.

Goetz had nine birdies and five bogeys. Johnson, of Wales, had only one bogey and claimed a share of the lead by sinking a 10-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole.

Harold Cudmore's One-Ton yacht, Jameson One, owned by the King of Norway, struck a rock and sank 20 yards from the beach a mile west of Cowes. It was the first time a yacht has sunk during the Admiral's Cup. Heavy seas made racing conditions tough for the 22 yachts starting the 27-mile inshore race.

The sultry, swinging melodies of Carmichael, the self-taught pianist and composer from Bloomington, Ind., were spun from the same spiritual thread as the music of his idol, the great cornetist Bix Beiderbecke. And \\"Hoagy on My Mind,\\" a new revue of Carmichael's music that plays through April 16 at the Ballroom (253 West 28th Street, Chelsea) honors his work with an easygoing charm that accentuates the deep strain of Americana in his songs.    The show is an informal pop-jazz musicale in which six musicians led by the singer Barbara Lea, the trumpeter Dick Sudhalter and the pianist and singer Bob Dorough run through many of Carmichael's standards and offer comment on his music and his life. Although the between-song patter has its stiff moments, the musical performances have the loose-jointed volubility of a jam session conducted by longtime colleagues who like to swing while avoiding any suggestion of high drama.
