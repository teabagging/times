The remote and primitive Karroo, with its scalding sun and inhospitable rock-strewn hills, abounds with lithops or flowering stones. These intriguing succulents are becoming increasingly popular as indoor plants.   Lithops are in subtle shades of gray, brown, rust, green and pink, and often are overlaid with intricate markings. Since the plants mimic their native habitat, there are varieties pale as desert sand while others look like small chunks of mineral ore.

Two years ago, Tom Reich, agent for Mike Edwards, put in a salary of $50,000 for the Oakland second baseman, and Charlie Finley, then the owner of the A's, made the figure $58,000.

And it's certainly true that among the art galleries niched high above 57th Street some are ''downtown'' in all but their location. Their image, that is to say, is that of an operation that starts small, travels light and will give new young people a chance. It is also true that there are downtown galleries, downtown restaurants and downtown shops that are ''uptown'' in their scope, their pretensions and their prices. There is a certain elasticity, that is to say, about these two concepts.   But there are also archetypal uptown institutions and archetypal downtown ones. You can't get much more uptown, in any sense, than the National Academy of Design, at 1083 Fifth Avenue at 89th Street. The address is right, the building (one of the finest of surviving New York town houses) is right, and the centennial tradition is right.  Under the directorship of John H.

The party has decided to begin a massive public relations campaign centered on the 100th anniversary of Brezhnevs birth, coming up on Dec. 19 (Brezhnev died in 1982). The campaign intends to debunk the myths that surround the period of Soviet history called stagnation of the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Events such as round-table discussions, photo exhibitions, and conferences all promoting accomplishments of Soviet power have been planned for the campaign.    CRIME IN THE MILITARY CATASTROPHIC: Crime in the military, particularly among officers, is at a catastrophic level, chief of the Moscow regional military court Aleksandr Beznasyuk told reporters Monday. This year alone, military courts in Moscow have looked at 1,500 cases. As a result of these trials, 1,650 individuals were sentenced and 18 were acquitted. Twenty-seven percent were found guilty of charges related to negligence of duty, 25 percent of theft, and 22 percent of irregular relationships. Of those sentenced, 235 were officers","excerpt":"up from 214 officers in the whole of 2005.    VEDOMOSTI    STEEL COMPANY TO LIST STOCK IN LONDON: Russian steel giant Severstal will list 25-30 percent of its stock for $1.5 to 3 billion on the London Stock Exchange in the near future. Experts see this as a move by the companys owner, Aleksei Mordashov, to bounce back from his unsuccessful bid to merge with European steel company Arcelor earlier this year. The listing could likewise pave the way for a merger with another large European steel producer.    MOSCOW COURT RULES AGAINST RAILROAD FEES: A Moscow district court ruled against Russian Railroads, a state-owned company, forbidding it to financially penalize ticketless passengers. Upon arrival to Moscows commuter train stations, you must feed your ticket into a turnstile in order to exit the area. If you do not have a ticket, you must buy one from the exit ticket booth for 50 rubles, or $1.85, over the normal price. Many times, the flimsy ticket stubs get lost or torn during the trip, presenting passengers with a dilemma upon their arrival. Although the rail company is set to appeal, this ruling is sure to cheer up Moscows commuters.    GAZETA    RUSSIAN COMPANIES OPEN TO MUSLIM INVESTORS: Dow Jones completed a Muslim-friendly stock index for Brazil, Russia, India and China last week that will allow Muslims to invest in 15 Russian corporations. Islam requires business to be conducted between equals, making investment on the basis of credit impossible for religiously observant Muslims. Only those companies that have balanced accounts payable and accounts receivablelike Gazprom, Lukoil, and Surgutneftegazwill be able to enter into the new Dow Jones Islamic index.    KOMMERSANT    A RETURN TO SOVIET BORDERS: The director of the Federal Security Service, Nikolai Patrushev, has issued an order to increase Russias boundary zones controlled by the security service FSB from 5 to 30 kilometers in some regions, almost the same as in the Soviet era. News of the plans has created a scandal in the far eastern Primorsky Krai, where the new border restrictions stand to cut off residents from traditional vacation areas. While preparations for the expansion were begun in March 2003, implementation will not start until the end of August.    KAZAN RESIDENTS HOMES IN JEOPARDY: Tatarstans government has appealed to the head of the Russian Registration Service, Sergei Movchan, for help in privatizing, free of charge, 15,000 new apartments, for which Kazan residents exchanged their already-privatized old homes from 1996 to 2004. Under federal law, citizens are entitled to free home privatization only once. Federal authorities are now faced with the dilemma of whether to set a precedent for double privatization or to deprive thousands of Kazans citizens of their right to their own home.

And they will try some tricks to get attention, too, like starting their new programs weeks head of everyone else's in the hopes that plenty of viewers will be back from vacation and sick of reruns and will want to sample something new.    This fall is the first full network season for UPN and WB, both of which began last January. Some say the two can hardly be called networks, since each brodcasts only two nights a week, UPN on Mondays and Tuesdays (in New York on Channel 9) and WB on Sundays and Wednesdays (in New York on Channel 11).Fox also began slowly, starting with only one show, Joan Rivers's late-night talk show, in late 1986, then adding Sunday-night programming in its second year (\\"The Tracy Ullman Show\\" and \\"Married... With Children\\") and increasing to four nights by the fall of 1990.    UPN (United/Parmount Network) made its voice heard immediately after it began broadcasting: its \\"Star Trek: Voyager\\" on Monday nights was a big success. But \\"Voyager\\" alone remains","excerpt":"UPN has scrapped every other series and this fall will offer only hourlong dramas.    Marching to a different drummer, WB (Warner Brothers) has developed only comedies, most of them family oriented and pitched toward children as much as adults. Four feature black families and one stars a Hispanic woman, in part because many of WB's affiliated stations are in big cities, many with large black and Hispanic populations.    This season each is adding a few hours of children's programmig on weekend mornings as well.    While the three older networks are to begin their new lineups in early and mid-September and Fox is to start on Thursday, WB began its new season last week and UPN is to start on Monday.   \\"We want to get a jump,\\" said Michael Sullivan, President of UPN's entertainment division.    \\"We want UPN to give you a sense of having shows you won't see anywhere else, shows that feel different,\\" Mr. Sullivan added, acknowledging that the success of \\"Voyager\\" sent UPN chasing after similar audiences. \\"Plus, we're trying to counter-program, and provide a clear viewing alternative in each hour,\\" he said, to the programs on other networks.    Two of its three new programs are science-fiction series, kin to \\"Voyager,\\" with its galactic explorers lost on a 24th-century starship (Mondy at 8 P.M). The third new hour is a soap opera set in a local television station.    \\"Nowhere Man\\" (Monday at 9 P.M.) stars Bruce Greenwood (who was Dr. Seth Griffin on \\"St. Elsewhere\\") as Thomas Veil, a photographer whose wife, mother, friends and even dog no longer recognize him, whose records have disappeared and who struggles to stay sane as he tries to discover how and why his existence has been erased.    \\"We wanted to tap into that 'Star Trek: Voyager' audience, but not with another space show, and you can't clone that anyway,\\" Mr. Sullivan said. \\"It's a 'Twilight Zone' feel, like they're out to disburb you.\\"    \\"In households with people who have more than four years of college education, 'Voyager' gets ratings twice as high as it gets over all,\\" he said. \\"and it's not just the sci-fi that interested them; it's the quality of the characters and the quality of the writing. So we've tried to find similar elements.\\"    In \\"Deadly Games\\" (Tuesday at 8 P.M.) evil characters from a home-made video game spring to life, armed with the supernatural powers and weapons they have in the game.    The villains are led by Sebastian Jackal (played by Christopher Lloyd, in his first television series since \\"Taxi\\" in the 1980's), pitted against the young scientist who created them and inadvertently brought them to life (James Calvert). Leonard Nimoy is a co-producer of the series.    \\"Live Shot\\" (Tuesday at 9 P.M.) is an ensemble drama built around a young single father who has just taken over a television station's news department, where a charismatic reporter, Liz Vega (played by Wanda De Jesus), undercovers the truth behind crime stories.    \\"The approach to Liz Vega was to write that role as a career guy, then put a female name to it,\\" said Dan Guntzelman. He and Steve Marshall, who met as writers on \\"WKRP in Cincinnati,\\" created this series. \\"We wanted to avoid the cliches of a female in a high-pressure career, the 'Oh, it's tough to be tough' and 'it's taking such a toll on me,' So we haven't given her much of a personal life yet.\\"    Over on WB, personal lives are the primary focus of just about every show. In keeping with the Warner Brothers kiddie-cartoon heritage, the network, which had a hodgepodge of poorly received shows last spring, is not aiming young, said its president, Jamie Kellner.    \\"I have made my life's work to aim young,\\" said Mr. Kellner, who came to WB from Fox. \\"I like kids, teens and young adults. That's who I like to program for.\\"    Three of WB's four Wednesday night programs are returning from last year after a new half-hour of \\"Sister, Sister\\" opens the night at 8. They are \\"The Parent 'Hood,\\" \\"Wayans Brothers\\" and \\"Unhappily Ever After.\\"    WB is offering nine new half-hour comedies (and a rerun and new episodes of one, \\"Sister, Sister\\"). It begins Sunday nights at 7 with a cartoon, \\"Steven Spielberg Presents Pinky and the Brain,\\" about two laboratory mice, who are spinoff characters from Mr. Spielberg popular charcters from Mr. Spielberg's popular \\"Animaniacs\\" show on Fox (which has now moved to WB'S morning slate).    After \\"Sister, Sister,\\" a former ABC show about 15-year old twins separated at birth and reunited by chance, WB plans to broadcast for new comedies.    \\"Simon\\" (8 P.M.) stars the comedian Harland Williams as what WB decribes as \\"a Forrest Gump-like\\" character trying to make it in Manhattan, with a cynical brother (Jason Bateman) often tripping him up. It's followed by \\"Kirt Cameron (late of \\"Growing Pains\\"), also about a young bachelor trying to make it in Manhattan. But this fellow is suddenly saddled with three younger siblings, when the aunt who had been taking care of them bails out.    Two series starring female comedians are next. \\"First Time out \\" (9 P.M.) has Jackie Guerra playing a young woman with two roommates who try to make it in Los Angeles. \\"Cleghorne\\" (9:30 P.M.) features Ellen Cleghorne, a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" alumna, playing a single mother, bring up a 9 year old daughter while her overbearing parents interfere.    \\"On Sunday night, there are major female-appeal shows on ABC, NBC and CBS, but they all dump into movies at 9,\\" Mr. Kellner said. \\"And Fox has heavy male comedy then. So we're doing heavy female comedy, an hour for the ladies.\\".    For ethnic ladies, in particular? \\"We did want to develop a show with Hispanic flavor, and looked hard for talent to work with, and found Jackie,\\" he replied. \\"With Ellen, we knew she wanted to leave 'Saturday Night Live' and we liked her very much.\\"    Of these shows on WB, Mr. Kellner said: \\"If we didn't believe in these programs, we wouldn't do it, but we're also primarily a big-city delivery system and we want our shows balanced toward the demographics of the cities. So it isn't entirely and accident.,\\" They're New, They're Competitive . . . and They're Coming to Your House"},{"year":"2001","title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer star, Sarah Michelle Gellar, is contractually bound to stay with 20th Century Fox Television show when it moves from WB to UPN","excerpt":"UPN has sent Gellar and others in cast costly welcoming gifts; photo (M) MediaTalk; UPN Tries to Make 'Buffy' Feel Welcome"},{"year":"2000","title":"UPN, struggling television network that reinvented itself as network of young male viewer, thanks to its wrestling programs, is at center of takeover battle that has implications for proposed CBS-Viacom merger","excerpt":"UPN is 50-50 partnership between Viacom and Chris-Craft Industries; Viacom and CBS have given Chris-Craft ultimatum to sell its UPN shares to Viacom or buy Viacom out; Christ-Craft wants to maintain partnership to help absorb financial losses that continue despite network's improving prospects; it has gone to court to stop merger, accusing Viacom of violating clause in their partnership agreemement that forbids Viacom from making deal with any competing network (M) Revitalized UPN Is at Center of a Struggle for Ownership"},{"year":"2000","title":"New York Supreme Court Judge Herman Cahn upholds ultimatum that Chris-Craft Industries has to buy or sell its interest in fledgling UPN network by March 20, giving Viacom Inc big victory in its quest to complete its merger with CBS Corp","excerpt":"UPN is 50-50 partnership between Viacom and Chris-Craft; Cahn rules against all of Chris-Craft's motions to thwart buy-sell provision initiated by Viacom and CBS; provision would force Christ-Craft to sell its interest in UPN for $5 million, meaning it would gain no value for asset it has tried to build up for last five years or else buy network for same figure, and assume all future losses by network; to date UPN has lost about $800 million (S) Chris-Craft Loses UPN Ruling"},{"year":"1997","title":"Fledgling television networks WB and UPN are battling each other for affiliates and, possibly, survival","excerpt":"UPN is suing Sinclair Communications for switching batch of stations it manages to WB, even though Sinclair still controls five other UPN affiliates; WB chief executive Jamie Kellner outlines expansion plans; drawing (M) A pair of fledgling TV networks, UPN and the WB, tussle over affiliates and, maybe, survival."},{"year":"1996","title":"Viacom Inc says it has exercised its option to buy 50 percent stake in United Paramount Network (UPN) from BHC Communications Inc for $160 million","excerpt":"UPN says its 152 affiliate stations reach 92 percent of United States households, which will give Viacom another outlet for its programs (S) VIACOM BUYS 50 PERCENT STAKE IN UPN NETWORK"},{"year":"1970","title":"NEWCASTLE &#8208","excerpt":"UPON &#8208; TYNE, England&#8212;Anyone interested in inflation as a psychological phenomenon&#8212;the emotions it arouses in an industrial society &#8212;might try some field work here in the urban center of Northeast England.

He told her that it ran in his family and that his father, who was 55, looked 40. She said her father was the same way. ''He's 79 but looks 40. It's a good thing, too, his wife is 39.''   STEPHANIE BELDOTTI      Scene: Upscale market in Ithaca, N.Y.    Dramatis Personae: Young man and woman, probably in their early 20's.    Observer: Bryna J. Fireside, in her 60's.    Action: Young man picks up package of seedless grapes. Young woman hesitates over nectarines.    Young woman: ''These nectarines look great. Shall I get some?''    Young man, popping a grape in his mouth: ''Uh, gee, I don't know.'' He then places the package of grapes in the shopping cart and says in a firm voice: ''No, no nectarines. The trouble with nectarines is that once you take a bite, you have to make a commitment to eat the whole thing. With grapes you can deal with just one.''    Observer, talking to herself: ''Sure hope she doesn't expect to marry this guy, if he can't make a commitment to a nectarine.''      Cora I. McKeown of Ridgewood, N.J., called a Borders Book Store to inquire if they carried the Home Visions Art Series on Vermeer. There were a few seconds of silence, so she spelled out the name and added that he was a noted Dutch painter.    ''Oh,'' said the clerk, exasperated. ''You might be better off calling Home Depot.''       Greta Tillinger and her daughter parked in Rego Park, Queens, and, to their dismay, noted that the keys had been left in the car. Her daughter went off to telephone the Automobile Association. Mrs. Tillinger, noticing a fire truck across the street, asked a fireman for help. He went over with an iron rod but was unable to open the door. A young man passing by assessed the situation, asked the fireman for the rod and -- presto -- the door was open. Mrs. Tillinger thanked him and jokingly asked, ''Are you a car thief?''    ''Yes,'' he said, and walked off.       Bernice Ravitz was on a bus across the aisle from a girl about 5 years old and her mother. The little girl asked her mother if she wanted to hear how well she could count, and then counted to 15, omitting 13. The mother asked her to repeat the count and again she omitted 13.    ''No darling,'' said the mother. ''You must count the regular way with 13, not the way it says on our elevator.''      Kieren van den Blink was standing in front of Bergdorf Goodman when she noticed a homeless woman leaning against the corner lamppost. The woman was in a bag -- she had made a hole for her head and arms and was sitting in the bag, shoeless. A well-dressed woman in a skirt and blazer walked over to the homeless woman and pulled a T-shirt and some other clothes out of a tote she was carrying. She then proceeded to help the woman put on the T-shirt and a pair of socks.    Since then, Ms. van den Blink has carried a T-shirt around in her bag because, she said, ''you never know when someone may need it a lot more than I.''    Dear Diary:    I walked into a bagel bakery early one Sunday morning and didn't notice that all the customers were bunched up against the wall until a voice by the cash register told me to join them.

There was a murmur of concern. Then someone suggested aloud that, as in the old silent movies, a sign be flashed on the screen before the show that said, ''Ladies, please remove your hats.''    The two ladies turned, faced the back of the theater, and with a flourish, removed their hats. They then took their seats, acknowledging the applause with a gracious smile.

Eileen Leeds, who lives in Stamford, Conn., was recently on a Madison Avenue bus en route to the Museum of the City of New York. As the bus approached the 90's, most of the passengers had left and Ms. Leeds chatted with the driver. Several hours later, Ms. Leeds left the museum. It had started raining, there wasn't a cab in sight and, wet and miserable, she headed for Lexington Avenue. Where could she find shelter until the rain eased, she wondered, looking at the nearby stores. Suddenly and to her great surprise because it wasn't a bus stop, a Lexington Avenue bus pulled up, stopped and the horn honked. The doors flew open and a voice cut through the downpour and said, ''Hop in.'' It was the bus driver she had had on her original journey. Talk about customer relations!       It was one of the last performances of ''Colin Quinn: An Irish Wake'' at the Helen Hayes Theater. A disgruntled theatergoer, sitting near Laura Pedersen, returned from the concession area and complained to seated friends, ''They call this an Irish wake, but they won't even let you bring a drink to your seat.''       They didn't need the coming revival of ''On the Town'' to inspire them -- Sidney Sandler gave his prescription information to the order taker for the AARP Pharmacy Service in Pennsylvania. He followed this with his address and ended with ''New York, New York.'' The following exchange ensued, short but a delight to both participants.    Order taker: ''It's a hell of a town.''    Mr. Sandler: ''The Bronx is up.''    Order taker: ''And the Battery is down.''

A man, probably in his late 50's, approached him, wearing well-tailored slacks, blue blazer and crisp shirt, but no tie. ''Would you sell me your tie?'' the man asked. ''I'll give you $20 for it.'' The exchange was made. Mr. Vogel pedaled off, but not before he saw the man put on the tie and smile at the well-dressed woman next to him. Mr. Vogel pegged the woman's look as equal parts of awe and disbelief.    HOLD THAT NOTE!    I can't get to Carnegie.    Never been to the Met.    The only music I hear is    When they press ''Hold'' and forget.    The selection's quite varied    And often so good,    Sometimes I don't mind,    Though I know I should.    So I listen with patience,    And don't make a fuss,    Even after the 10th    ''Your call's important to us.''    Each company's found    A niche they think's pretty slick    An artist or style    With whom they then stick.    George Winston's on Gateway    While Sting is on Compaq.    My bank's playing Handel    While I wait to make contact.    ''Hold'' plays almost anything     Fast paced or slow.    But the elevator's still    The best place to hear Manilow.   JAY SULLIVAN       Lawrence H. Zisman understands that there are many mysteries in life, from how the great pyramids in ancient Egypt were built to when the universe will end. He even understands that there are more than occasional mysteries involving the United States Postal Service. Still, he wonders how a postcard sent from the La Jolla Presbyterian Church in La Jolla, Calif., to a church member who lives on Azul Street, also in La Jolla, was delivered to him in East Windsor, N.J., along with his bills, magazines and sweepstakes entry forms.    The card announced the date of a future ministry committee meeting. Mr. Zisman called the California church so it could get in touch with its parishioner. But he's now philosophizing about the possible reason behind the rerouting -- could it have been a divine message to convert to Presbyterianism and move to California? Who knows?      Is it possible that the couple Paul Drinkwater saw walking down the street, each talking on a cell phone, were talking to each other? Say it isn't so.    Dear Diary:    My sister-in-law was married to a prominent surgeon who specialized in open-heart surgery. A member of operating teams at two hospitals in the  Chicago area, St. Francis and Christ, he would operate in the morning and field calls in the evening about his patients from the resident staffs. One evening during a visit, the doctor was on the telephone talking to a resident at Christ Hospital when the other phone rang. My sister-in-law answered, then whispered to the doctor, ''It's St. Francis calling.''    He whispered back: ''Tell St. Francis I'll have to call back. I'm talking to Christ.''

He stopped her, showed her the envelope and asked, ''Is Tempe right?'' Yes. she said, and added a lagniappe -- the ZIP code.

Christian Ludwig, the Margrave of Brandenburg, to whom the six concertos were inscribed in 1721, was the brother of King Frederick William I of Prussia.

The article read, in part, as follows:\\"In contrast to the silent film, the enrichment of the tone film depends upon the very means of expression in the handling of which the producing artists of various categories—musicians and writers—are specialists","excerpt":"upon vocal and instrumental music and the spoken word.\\"From the moment the persons on the screen begin to talk or sing, the more or less improvised production methods of the silent films, the most striking results of which derive from notions born in the studio, are applicable no longer.\\"While in the case of a silent film the presentation of an event interests us more than the event itself or its ideological background, in the case of the audible film, because here words and music make their appearance, our attention is directed again upon what is back of the event, upon its philosophical content, upon the background of the scene.\\"It must not be considered enough merely to use words and music for the clarification or support of an event which could be shown just as well by a silent picture. Words and music must be employed in their full significance and effect as the artistic molding of an idea. Only in this way can the tone film acquire a serious artistic form of its own.\\"Therefore, it isn't enough to take a literary man for the dialogue and a musician for the musical ground-work. The attempt must be made, once at least, to place the production of tone films in the hands of persons who understand the possibilities of expression of words and music and who regard it as just their task to use this knowledge for the presentation of their ideas in a plastic scenic form.\\"Whenever this theme comes up we always hear the film technical men object that everything proposed by the musicians and authors is meant for the theatre and is no good for the movies. It is easy to reply that I write music for concert halls, for plays, for operas, for choirs and for schools—and every time I encounter quite different conditions, every time I must adapt myself to a quite different principle. Of course, the tone film's forms of expression are basically different from those of the theatre. The sound film requires a different economy, a different division of the grades of intensity, different laws of dynamics, of movement, of tempo. The tone film affords new and unusual motives for composition. It also demands new forms of language from the authors.
