Norman Schwarzkopf of the United States, the allied commander, and Lieut Gen. Khalid bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia, the commander of Arab forces, after talks with Iraqi military officers on a permanent cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war: SCHWARZKOPF STATEMENT   Let me just say that we have just completed what I think were very frank, very candid and very constructive discussion with the Iraqi military. The purpose of this meeting, as stated previously by the President of the United States, was so that we could agree on certain conditions that were necessary to continue with a cessation of hostilities and the cessation of coalition offensive operations.   I am very happy to tell you that we agreed on all matters. Some of the subjects that were discussed were control measures to insure that units, armed units of the coalition do not come in contact with armed units of the Iraqi military that result in any more deaths.    We have received information on the location of minefields in Kuwait and minefields in international waters so that we can begin operations immediately to make those areas safe.   We have also made it very clear that upon the signing of a cease-fire, but not before, all coalition forces will be drawn back from Iraqi territory that we currently occupy.    The most important point that we discussed was the immediate release of all prisoners of war. We have agreed that this release should be immediate. We have agreed that the details of this release must be worked out by the International Red Cross. But both sides have agreed that we will do everything we can to work with the Red Cross to as rapidly as possible determine locations and times. We have also asked that as a token of good faith on both sides that we have a symbolic release immediately. And I feel sure based upon our discussions that such a symbolic release should take place.    We have provided the Iraqis with the names of all of the missing in action, and we have asked for as much information as we could get concerning those missing in action. We have also asked them to provide us with the names of anyone who may have died while they're in their, in the custody. And we have also asked for the return of the remains.    I would just say that I think we have made a major step forward in the cause of peace. And I have every expectation that if we continue the open and frank and cooperative dialogue that we had today, and I would say very candidly that the Iraqis came to discuss and to cooperate with a positive attitude, that we are well on our way to a lasting peace.  KHALID STATEMENT    I think we should consider today as a memorable, historic day. And I hope that peace will last in the Middle East and the whole world. The attitude today, I concur with General Schwarzkopf that it was excellent. We have all the answers for all our questions. The delegation, the Iraqi delegations were willing to, not only to answer, but to satisfy us in every request we had.    I believe that also we have Saudi border outside the theater of operation also we discussed, and it is secured. And for Kuwait, I would like just to emphasis what General Schwarzkopf said, that we have a good, big number of detainees from Kuwait which I hope it will come very soon.
