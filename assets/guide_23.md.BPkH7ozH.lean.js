However, religious scholars are apt to read into old texts the validity to ban many modern acts and transactions not contemplated by the revealed law.   Those who have followed the debate in Islam over the legitimacy of interest payments on loans and investments have been reminded of the parallel arguments of Christian scholastics on the church's ban on usury in the Middle Ages.   A few years ago, King Fahd called for a conference of Islamic scholars to revive the judicial tool of \\"ijtihad,\\" or creative reasoning, and put an end to invoking ancient opinions and rulings for radically different conditions and circumstances.   Those aggrieved by the Minister of Interior's ban on driving are better advised to resort to the courts. The recently reorganized Board of Grievances, a civil tribunal with wide jurisdiction outside the religious court system, has competence to review ministerial orders and governmental decrees for various causes.    By resorting to the courts, they would not only test the validity of the ban, but they would also enhance the authority of the judiciary and promote the separation of powers, which is an essential ingredient for a meaningful Consultative Assembly, or Majlis Shura, such as the Saudi Arabian authorities have been promising to set up.

Clinton's ''My Life'' is holding at No. 10 in its 26th week","excerpt":"Carter's ''Sharing Good Times,'' which made its first appearance here last week, is at No. 8. As writers go, these men are pretty different. In his memoir, Clinton took a Norman Mailer-like swing for the bleacher seats. Carter, on the other hand, has been mostly content to crack out singles and doubles in his literary career, and he has even dropped the occasional bunt. (His book of poems, ''Always a Reckoning,'' had a six-week run here in 1995.) In the process, Carter has become the Joyce Carol Oates of American ex-presidents. He has published no fewer than 19 books, 17 of them since he left office, and more than half have made the Times list. ''Sharing Good Times'' is a fairly unassuming piece of work. It puts forward the not-exactly-controversial thesis that ''experiences are more deep and lasting sources of pleasure when they are shared with others.'' What gives ''Sharing Good Times'' friction and depth is Carter's sometimes bracing understanding of his own flaws. (''True sharing of my personal life with others has not come naturally to me,'' he admits.) One thing Carter does not like to share, at least with his wife, Rosalynn, is the editing process. The couple once wrote a book together, he says, and while her edits of his work were ''drastic,'' she considered her own sections ''to have the same status as the Ten Commandments brought down by Moses from Mount Sinai.'' Rosalynn Carter may know what she is doing. Her memoir ''First Lady From Plains,'' published in 1984, had a longer run on this page -- 18 weeks -- than has any book of her husband's.    SCHLEPPED OUT: The topic of Jimmy Carter's new book, as well as its small size and somewhat modest price ($21), gave it the feel of a stocking stuffer. Another small book that -- inexplicably, to cat-avoiders everywhere -- became a phenomenon of sorts during the holidays was a pocket-size volume called ''Bad Cat,'' which is No. 4 on this week's paperback advice, how-to and miscellaneous list. Compiled by Jim Edgar, ''Bad Cat'' feels like tomorrow's garage sale item, here today. It provides a gallery of photographs of disgruntled felines, with sub-''Garfield'' captions on the order of: ''I don't need to hear about your day. Just open the can.'' A funnier impulse buy that sold well through the holidays -- it is No. 23 on the extended hardcover miscellaneous list -- was Ellis Weiner and Barbara Davilman's ''Yiddish With Dick and Jane,'' a parody of the classic children's book series. Page 7 of this book seemed to speak for worn-out shoppers everywhere: ''See Jane schlep. / Schlep, Jane. Schlep. / Schlep, schlep, schlep.''
