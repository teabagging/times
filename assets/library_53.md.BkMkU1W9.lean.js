Buttery breakfast pastries and moist muffins ($1.25 and up) are served with coffee and fresh juices.   Lunch items, to take out or eat in at little cafe tables or at the counter, include sandwiches (roasted vegetables, for example, or French-style ham, $5 to $6), salads (like ratatouille, couscous with vegetables or lentils, mostly $2 to $5 a pound), and main dishes, including roast chicken ($4.50 to $12). There are also dessert tarts, cakes and cookies. The shop is open from 9 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. A Second Porcini Trading    Porcini Trading, a small produce market that opened last fall at 1450 Second Avenue (75th Street), has just opened a second, larger market at 1510 Second Avenue (78th Street). The owners plan to keep both stores open. The new market sells some prepared foods and has a broader selection of groceries and dairy products than the original market. Both now have fresh imported porcini mushrooms from Italy. They range in price from $7.50 to $30 a pound, depending on the size and quality, which for the beefy top-of-the-line ones is impeccable.  Corrado Opens a Market    Joining Corrado, a restaurant at 1373 Avenue of the Americas (55th Street), and its neighboring Corrado Cafe and Corrado Kitchen catering shop is the new Corrado Market. But instead of being clustered with the other Corrado properties, this food market and catering shop is uptown, at 1409 Second Avenue (73d Street). It is a spacious, rather homey-looking food market with a typical array of produce, breads, cheeses and some high-end packaged groceries like olive oils and pasta.   Some of the prepared food items are especially delicious, like the penne pasta with eggplant, baked butternut squash, linguine with shiitake mushrooms, all for $7 a pound, and the fresh salmon salad, $15 a pound. The market is open every day. Telephone: (212) 472-9200. Mail-Order Spices    Adriana's Bazaar, a retail store on the Upper West Side that sold spices and condiments from around the world until it closed earlier this year, has become Adriana's Caravan, a mail-order company in Brooklyn with a catalogue of more than 1,000 items. Copies of the catalogue can be ordered for $3 by calling (800) 316-0820. A condensed version of the catalogue is free. Hot Stuff in Flux    Another source of spiciness may also switch to mail order. Hot Stuff, a shop specializing in spicy ingredients, at 227 Sullivan Street (near Bleecker Street), will close at the end of the year. David Jenkins, the owner, said he hoped to open a new store elsewhere in Manhattan with a small restaurant, to help generate better sales, or to convert it into a mail order house.  The Parlor Set    The younger generation should be more than happy with the fare at Mr. Chips, 27 East 92d Street, a classy new ice-cream parlor owned by Chip Fisher. Mr. Fisher, who has young children and lives in the neighborhood, also owns Fisher & Levy, a cafe and caterer, and Lamalle Kitchenware.    The new ice-cream parlor is sleekly modern, done in blond wood, with low counters and child-height stools in sherbet pastels. A swath of chalk board, with chalk provided, covers the wall above the counter. The ice cream comes in more than a dozen flavors. The restaurant is open from 11:30 A.M to 10 P.M. on weekdays, and from noon to 10 P.M. on weekends. Battle of the Wines    An all-day tasting to compare American chardonnays and pinot noirs with French red and white Burgundies made from the same grapes has been scheduled for Dec. 10 at the International Wine Center, 231 West 29th Street, Suite 210. The tasting, which will begin at 10 A.M. and end at about 4:30 P.M., will cover 42 wines and include lunch. The wines will be tasted blind in groups of three. The fee for the tasting is $235 and must be paid in full to secure a reservation. More information is available from the Wine Center, (212) 268-7517. Indian Feast in Queens    Dinner for 50,000?

So it's hardly surprising that \\"Barbarians at the Gate,\\" a factual account of the takeover madness of the 1980's, has been made for sponsor-free pay cable. The flawed but fascinating production, starring James Garner, has its premiere on HBO on Saturday at 8 P.M.

Condensing the story into a movie running less than two hours, Larry Gelbart, the creator of television's \\"M*A*S*H,\\" has eliminated the players in the middle layers to focus almost entirely on the top-level principals, most notably F.

The 19th-century American writer in Europe operated as a paradigmatic explorer. Before him was a double task. He had to master every inmost recess of an ancient civilization. But he also had to come to terms with what Europe had to tell him about himself. And the same was true of the visiting American artist.

The takeover talks reflect both the tide of changing technologies and the growing power of big Wall Street brokerage houses to force changes that save them money.    GASOLINE  Driving a Bargain  When inflation is taken into account, gasoline prices have fallen to record lows, averaging $1.14 a gallon this month. Crude-oil prices have also fallen, to a little over $14 a barrel, a 33 percent drop in a year. Behind the free fall: a worldwide oversupply of crude oil, reduced Asian demand and a warm winter that has reduced the need for heating oil. In a land of cheap gas, Atlanta has the cheapest -- 79.9 cents a gallon for regular at one station -- thanks to low gasoline taxes, intense competition among stations and the convergence of two major pipelines.    JAPAN  Financial Scandal Widens  Prosecutors raided Japan's central bank and arrested Yasuyuki Yoshizawa, who runs its capital markets division. He was suspected of leaking secrets to Japanese banks. The governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasuo Matsushita, right, offered to resign. The Government agreed to pump nearly $11 billion into 17 leading Japanese banks as part of a program to replenish their capital and restore public confidence in the debt-burdened financial system. Under pressure from Washington and other Western governments, officials of the governing Liberal Democratic Party indicated that they were putting together an $80 billion package to stimulate the shrinking Japanese economy -- but without the big tax cut that the West has been urging.    MARKETS  Record After Record  Quickly turning their backs on earnings warnings from Intel, Motorola and Compaq, stock traders repeatedly bid up prices. By Thursday, all the leading indexes had climbed to all-time highs, reflecting a flurry of mergers and acquisitions and optimism that stocks are the best investment choice. Low oil prices have helped the market, one analyst said, because consumers have more money to invest. This year alone, the Dow industrials have risen 8.8 percent and the S.& P. 500 has jumped 10.1 percent. Despite slipping on Friday, the Dow still ended the week up 33.13 points, at 8,602.52. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 5.89 percent.    THE ECONOMY  Buyers, Buyers Everywhere  Consumer spending began the year at a healthy pace, the Commerce Department said, with retail sales up a full percentage point in January and half a point in February. But prices seem to remain under control. The Labor Department said that prices paid to producers of goods fell 0.1 percent last month, adding to a string of declines that has sent the Producer Price Index down 1.6 percent in the last 12 months. On the worrisome side, the department said the deficit in the nation's current account, the broadest measure of foreign trade, jumped in 1997 to its highest level in 10 years: $166.4 billion, compared with $148.2 billion in 1996. Productivity rose at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter, the Labor Department said, less than half the 3.6 percent rate in the third quarter.    ANTITRUST  Two Deals Questioned  Lockheed Martin asserted that the Government ''fundamentally opposed'' its planned purchase of Northrop Grumman, fearing that the combination might lead to insufficient competition among military suppliers. Previously, the Pentagon had encouraged such mergers to help cut costs. Separately, regulators in Europe and the United States have deepened their antitrust inquiries into Worldcom's $37 billion deal for MCI Communications because both are leading carriers of Internet traffic. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, above, told Worldcom stockholders in Jackson, Miss., that he was concerned about the impact on workers, as Bernard J. Ebbers, the company's chief executive, looked on. Shareholders of the two companies overwhelmingly approved the deal.    SUPREME COURT  Gray Markets Upheld  Virtually insuring the continuation of a multibillion-dollar ''gray market'' in unauthorized sales of goods, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that American manufacturers cannot invoke copyright law to block the domestic sale of products they originally sold at a discount overseas. At issue were beauty products made in America, sold in Britain and brought back to the United States by an independent distributor. The decision was a victory for discounters and, some argued, for consumers. Gray marketers have drawn the ire of the National Association of Manufacturers, many other industry groups and the Clinton Administration.    MERGERS  A Whole Lot of Garbage  Waste Management, the troubled leader in the trash-disposal market, and USA Waste Services, a rival, announced an unusual merger that values Waste Management at more than $13 billion and leaves its shareholders with a majority of the stock, but with USA Waste's top managers in charge. . . .

It moves, with a pureness of spirit, in the realm of simple Christian faith and it comes to a supernatural climax that draws entirely on devout credulity.Admirers of the beautifully pictorial should find it a photographic gem","excerpt":"those sensitive to poetic image-making should be touched by its candid poignancy.All it tells is the simple story of a little Spanish lad who is raised by the gentle brothers of a poor monastery into whose lives he brings the extraordinary happiness of caring for a healthy, normal child.Then one day he goes into the attic, which has been forbidden to him, and he sees there, within the shadows, the awesome shape of a life-sized crucifix. In his naïveté and childish fancy, he thinks the figure of Christ is real and he is touched by the look of sadness and suffering on the face. He fetches food for the figure. A hand reaches for the gift and a deep voice thanks the little fellow. He is pleased that he has made a new friend.Thereafter the guileless youngster secretly filches bread and wine from the poor pantry of the monastery and takes it to the attic for his \\"friend.\\" As a reward for his kindness, he is told he may have anything he wishes. He says he would like to see his mother, whom he has never known. From this you can jump to conclusions. And you may depend on good taste. The picture has an ending similar to that of the famous story of \\"The Juggler of Notre Dame.\\"To be sure, the story is scanty, and it does drag a bit here and there, but Ladislao Vajda, the director, has laced it with charming and sweet details. The youngster, played by Pablito Calvo, is an incredibly appealing lad, with a face like an absolute angel's and a personality you cannot help but adore. He is mischievous. He is naughty. But he is gentle and full of childish grace. Director Vajda has done wonders with him and the film centers on his little being.As the more practical and prominent of the brothers, Juan Calvo is heart-warming, too, while a half dozen or so of the pious inhabitants of the monastery are played delightfully.The reality of a plain stone building and rural surroundings is sharp and clear, and Señor Vajda has imbued his little picture with a flavorsome country atmosphere.

The 1994 Bordeaux reds were over all better than the 1993's, but like the wines  of 1991 and 1992, they failed to match the excellent 1990's. In general, 1994 was a good but not excellent year for all the wine regions listed. Only Sauternes and red Burgundy rated lower than 7 out of 10, and the Sauternes may well improve. The chart is better on older vintages","excerpt":"those that have withstood -- or failed -- the test of time. Even then, there are grounds for debate. Are the 1982's really the wine of the century? Have the 1975's come around? Will they ever? Don't look to a vintage chart when these weighty issues arise. There are years like 1991, when the vineyards of the northern Rhone Valley produced superb wines, while those of the southern Rhone, including Chateauneuf-du-Pape, gave forth mostly junk. The northern Rhone rated a high 9 that year; the southern Rhone, at best a low 6. Averaging them serves neither region well. California is divided, probably for the last time, into two categories, cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. O.K., a good year for cabernet sauvignon in California is usually a good year for the other Bordeaux varieties, merlot and cabernet franc. But what about zinfandel, pinot noir, sangiovese, mourvedre and  other red varieties competing for stardom? Let's face it: can a single-digit rating encompass the wines of Mendocino, 120 miles north of San Francisco, the wines of the Sierra foothills, 100 miles east  of the Pacific, and the wines of Temecula, 60 miles miles north of the Mexican border? Vintage-chart makers skirt the problem, or pretend to, by noting that their ratings apply mostly to the North Coast wine counties, Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino. Vintage charts were once more relevant. The wine world was smaller, more manageable and essentially French. Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne were what counted and, on a few more generous charts, the Loire and the Rheingau. Italy and the New World were ignored. Who could have envisioned then that serious table wines would one day come from  New Mexico and New Zealand, from Sicily and South Africa, Long Island and Washington State, Chile and Australia? And Spain. Not just Spain but regions within Spain -- Rioja, Penedes, Navarra and Rueda? How can a single vintage chart encompass them all? And then there are the variables in wine making. Robert M. Parker Jr., the wine  critic, put it succinctly when he qualified one of his own charts by observing that all such efforts \\"are filled with exceptions to the rule.\\" These include, he continued, \\"astonishingly good wines from skillful or lucky vintners in years rated mediocre, and thin, diluted, characterless wines from incompetent or greedy producers in great years.\\" And Champagne? Most Champagne is a blend of wine from different years: nonvintage. Which literally has no place on a vintage chart. Vintage Champagne appears only in years when the producers know it's going to be good. Does it help to rate it? Maybe. A little. Vintaging wine is a marketing tool. Perhaps consumers are beginning to realize that good wine makers make good wine. They recognize labels that, year in, year  out, represent quality at reasonable prices. With that knowledge they have the confidence to make their own judgments.      TASTINGS Perrin Reserve Cotes-du-Rhone, 1994. About $10.

A few years ago friends took a barge cruise through Belgium, with stops at castles and other historic sites. They cannnot remember who conducted the tour. Can you identify this cruise? -- L. Sprague de Camp, Plano, Texas    A.  The company might have been Floating Through Europe (271 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-221-314- or 212-685-5600), which has been operating barge cruises in Belgium for eight years. A six-night, seven-day cruise called \\"Hidden Treasures of Belgium,\\" is on a barge called the Juliana, which accommodates 18 passengers and starts in the medieval city of Bruges and ends in Brussels.

Cruises start June 2 and 9 and Aug. 11 and 18; the cost is $1,995 a person in double occupancy. The company also runs two two-week cruises, at $3,990 a person, with a week each in the Netherlands and Belgium; either one-week segment, $1,995, can be purchased separately. The company also operates barge cruises in England and France.   Two other barges have wider itineraries that include Belgium. One is Etoile de Champagne (care of Moran Travel, 89 Broad Street, Boston, Mass. 02110; 800-666-1620), which will make a two-week trip starting May 11, 1991, that takes in the southern part of the Netherlands, along with Belgium and France.

I have a portable telephone, which I try to use aboard airplanes, normally on the ground or at low altitude. Recently, I was informed by a flight attendant that I could not. Is that true? -- Matthew Adell, New York, N.Y.    A.  You are not allowed to use a cellular phone in an airborne plane, according to the Federal Communications Commission. There is no rule against use of the phones in a plane before it takes off, but the Federal Aviation Administration gives the pilot the right to prohibit the use of any electronic device on a plane, and many do. The use of cellular phones in an airborne plane will interfere with use of ground-based phones, an F.C.C. spokesman said.    The Government is currently investigating whether the use of cellular phones in a plane on the ground can interfere with the plane's electronic equipment. A rule based on the findings is expected to be issued by March.

Robert Silverberg's KINGDOMS OF THE WALL (Spectra/Bantam, $22.95) is a parable about the danger of seeking more intimate contact with the powers that control the universe. On a distant planet a race of people who superficially resemble humans lives at the foot of a mountain so steep and so tall that it is known as the Wall. Their myths tell of a Prometheus-like First Climber who ascended the Wall and brought back useful knowledge from the gods who live at the summit. In honor of this First Climber, the people periodically choose 40 of their best and brightest as Pilgrims, who try to climb the Wall and parley with the gods. Most fail to return","excerpt":"those who do are invariably mad, and their reports of what they have seen at the summit make little sense.   The band of Pilgrims to whom Mr. Silverberg directs our attention has better luck. The Wall turns out to be an entire range of mountains offering trial after trial as horrific as any observered by Dante in the Inferno. Many former Pilgrims have ended up in the clutches of monsters capable of stealing one's body, mind and will. The author makes some attempt to distinguish between these monsters, and there are hints that each Pilgrim's fate is determined by his or her character. But since the only Pilgrims we get to know well are those who escape the monsters, the fate of the less fortunate seems more arbitrary than ordained.

Disputes over airline rights can divide even friends as close as Britain and the United States. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner rejected British Airways' proposed fare cuts to the United States last Tuesday. Britain had blocked the sale by Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, both desperate for cash, of several London routes to Heathrow airport that United and American Airlines want to buy. Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, flew into New York himself last week to display solicitude for the ailing airlines. The dispute is \\"not about knocking Pan Am or T.W.A. out of business altogether,\\" he said. He also urged timid Americans to resume traveling abroad","excerpt":"those who don't risk losing business, he said. What British Airways actually seeks are broader operating rights in the United States, said American analysts. Problem is, that sort of deal might normally take a year to work out; T.W.A. and Pan Am need agreements within a few months.  Oddball Salary Inequities  When Babe Ruth was asked, about 60 years ago, why he deserved $80,000 when President Hoover only made $75,000, Ruth's legendary response was, \\"I had a better year than he did.\\" A week ago, Roger Clemens signed a four-year contract giving him a record average of $5.4 million a year; President Bush draws $200,000. Clemens won 21 games, holding opponents to an average of less than two runs a game. George Bush showed quick reflexes in the Persian Gulf but bobbled the tax issue. So Clemens did have the better year. But 27 times better? Enough so that the cost of a single Clemens victory more than covers Bush's salary for an entire season? And the President certainly outplayed, say, Jeff Parrett, the Atlanta Braves pitcher, who recently settled for $855,000 after winning five, losing 10. Memo to team owners wanting to economize: draft George, the former Yale baseball captain, when his Washington contract is up. Alcohol-Fed Inflation Economists have found another fuel to blame for increasing wholesale inflation. A record 5.9 percent jump in alcohol prices raised the core inflation rate in January by five-tenths of 1 percent. Higher alcohol taxes do not figure into producer prices, but many manufacturers took the chance to raise their own prices. Some economists said that, even after accounting for liquor costs, the rising core rate would keep the Federal Reserve from easing further. \\"The Fed will rest on its oars for at least a couple more weeks,\\" said Irwin L. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover Trust. The broader inflation rate, including food and energy, fell one-tenth of 1 percent, as oil prices declined. Golden Arch of Catfish?  McDonald's believes it has found a recipe for Southern success: The Crispy Catfish Sandwich, a 2.3-ounce patty with lettuce and tangy sauce on a bun. McDonald's plans to sell it at 214 outlets in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky and Tennessee. Restaurants that specialize in catfish are hardly trembling. Don Buckner, general manager of Hall's on the River in Winchester, Ky., described McDonald's seafood sandwiches as \\"block pieces of fish\\" -- suitable for someone who would otherwise have a quarter-pounder. His $9.95 all-you-can-eat catfish dinner includes vegetables and hush puppies, he added. No hush puppies at McDonald's, said a spokeswoman, convinced that Southern customers will accept french fries. Competition for Cellular Lines All that static on the cellular phone lines is coming from aggrieved duopolists. The Federal Communications Commission decided on Wednesday to allow a new form of mobile service in six cities, including New York. Radio dispatch companies for taxis and delivery services will be able to squeeze thousands of other customers into their narrow slices of the radio spectrum. Cellular services that have flourished under rules allowing only two in each city could find competition heating up. Analysts doubt the new service, to be offered initially by Fleet Call Inc. of Bloomfield, N.J., will match cellular's flexibility and features. But the cellular industry called the decision unfair and threatened a fight. Production Declines Ease The slump in industrial output continued for a fourth month in January, but the decline was a moderate four-tenths of 1 percent after much steeper drops in the two previous months. Some economists said the report hints that the worst of the recession is past. But industries used only 79.9 percent of their capacity, the least in four years. In Brief A seven-tenths of 1 percent decline in already lean business inventories in December gave economists hope that any increase in demand would result in higher production. Citibank, long aloof and superior, has decided to join the automated teller machine masses. Its machines will become part of the Cirrus network, sharing access with machines from 7,200 other banks and financial institutions.  COMPANIES   George Ball Steps Down When the big boys on Wall Street are suffering, a guy who tried to play with them but failed is truly in trouble. George L. Ball resigned as chairman and chief executive of Prudential-Bach Securities last Wednesday, felled by his loss of $308 million in less than nine years as the firm's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Ball tried to transform a humdrum brokerage firm into a glamorous, global investment bank, throwing around millions to hire star financiers. When the Prudential Insurance Company of America lost patience with his prodigal ways, he responded with what he called a \\"light cruiser\\" strategy, fighting only those competitive battles that he believed the firm could win. The losses continued, however, and Mr. Ball finally gave up his command. Carter Hawley Hale Goes Under  The real markdowns at Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. last week were on \\"junk bonds\\" and common stock; the largest department store chain on the West Coast, parent of the Broadway, Weinstocks and Emporium names, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The Carter Hawley Hale story was another 1980's tale of efficient wealth transfer from bondholders, long-term investors and employees -- whose 45 percent stake in the company is now nearly worthless -- to lawyers, investment bankers and the usual short-term profiteers. In its efforts to fight off a takeover attempt led by the Limited Inc. chain in 1987, Carter Hawley Hale had taken on hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Little was left, therefore, to improve the stores. Competition and a slack American economy did the rest. Auto Makers in Decline The Ford Motor Company has cut back, streamlined production and improved efficiency enough to almost rival the Japanese. But its fourth-quarter loss of $519 million confounded its mission to keep profits flowing even when a recession strikes. The General Motors Corporation lost $1.62 billion, giving the industry its second-worst quarter ever. Analysts were understanding, saying that auto companies can face no worse combination than a recession and higher energy prices. As James P. Womack, an auto industry authority at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, \\"You can't take a 25 percent hit on volume and make much money in any business.\\" In Brief A Federal bankruptcy judge approved the sale of 67 Eastern Airlines takeoff and landing slots and five gates at Washington National Airport to Northwest Airlines for $35.5 million. The Justice Department blocked a bid by United Airlines for antitrust reasons. U S West Inc. agreed to pay $10 million, the largest antitrust fine ever, for violating the agreement that broke up the Bell System. INTERNATIONAL   Germany's High-Cost East One weekend last fall, a carnival on East Berlin's Alexanderplatz was so dreary that visitors had to ask to make sure it was taking place. On the Kurfurstendamm in West Berlin, meanwhile, every evening brought out raucous crowds lingering well past midnight. German officials said last Tuesday that giving eastern Germany much to celebrate will prove far more costly than they had thought. With a turnaround nowhere in sight, the Government approved $3 billion in emergency aid for cities and states. Economists say that rebuilding the eastern regions will cost the Government nearly $100 billion this year, more than $1 trillion over the decade. Traditional Eastern European export markets have evaporated, factories are closing and residents are leaving for the West. Germany's bind might well pinch relations with the United States. The cost of aiding the easterners makes Germans more reluctant to lower interest rates in support of the dollar or finance the war in the Middle East. Trouble With the Trade Deficit The trade deficit is heading in the right direction for the wrong reasons. The gap shrank to $6.3 billion in December, better than most economists had expected. Imports fell 7.9 percent, as the recession curbed America's appetite for foreign goods. But exports slipped also, by 2.1 percent, auguring ill for one of the economy's few healthy areas. \\"We can't count on that sector as much in the months ahead,\\" said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. As foreign economies slow, not even a weaker dollar is sufficient to stoke overseas demand.

By Pascal Bruckner. Translated by William R. Beer. 244 pages. Free Press. $17.95. PASCAL BRUCKNER is a prodigy of polemic. In ''The Tears of the White Man,'' his first book to be published in the United States, the French writer exercises his gifts on members of the intelligentsia who go gaga over the third world while denigrating the West. Although his examples are drawn from his own country, beginning with Jean-Paul Sartre, his case has applicability to the United States as well, as William R. Beer, who did the translation, points out in an introduction. Mr. Beer notes that lacking a colonial past to feel guilty about, a portion of the American left has used American Indians, blacks, young people and women in much the way that some French leftists have used the inhabitants of their former colonies as weapons in an assault on Western values and culture.   Mr. Bruckner, who confesses he was for a time one of the ''third worldists'' whom he batters here, draws on his own experience to support his argument.

For prospective home-exchangers, it's the time to read swap catalogues, with their cryptic entries, optimistically seeking a vine-covered cottage by the Avon in England to be exchanged for a split-level on Long Island.    Some searchers may hunch over the electronic fireside: A computer bulletin board for exchangers and renters, begun in November 1993, is so new it has only 200 or so listings, all but a handful in the United States. But access is free except for a toll call to Florida, which can be made at midnight, so there is little to lose. Targeting Teachers    Teacher Swap, now entering its ninth year, will publish its 1995 catalogue in March, plus two supplements after that. The proprietors, Ron and Ellie Frevola of Long Island, have a loose definition of teacher, encompassing active and retired, volunteer and paid, Sunday school and adult-education teachers. Mr. Frevola said the most important qualification is a long vacation making settling-in worthwhile, although some swappers offer long weekends.    People sending information who want the listing to appear in the directory that is distributed overseas should postmark the entry form by Jan. 20. If only a domestic exchange is sought, the deadline is Feb. 15. At the present pace of submissions, Mr. Frevola expects to have 700 listings in the year. Last year the main book had 34 pages with 538 entries: 225 from 32 states, 34 from Canada and 279 from 28 foreign countries, mostly in Europe.   The catalogue, which has telegraphic entries and no pictures, urges subscribers to try early and not give up the first year if they particularly want a house.    Mr. Frevola, asked about the possibility that people might come home to a damaged house, said that he had not heard of this from any exchangers among his 2,000 to 3,000 subscribers over eight years. A half-dozen complaints, none serious, had been received, he said.    Like the other publishers, Mr. Frevola said he got complaints about dirty dishes in the cupboard or car trunks that did not lock. The worst problem, he said, was created by three young teachers from France who loved their exchange with a Westchester teacher but left behind a $400 phone bill for calls to France. Mr. Frevola said his associate in France, Michel Barrere, called the three teachers and the bill was paid.    Typically, the Frevolas' catalogue disclaims \\"all responsibility for a successful exchange of homes.\\" It also says: \\"All subscribers agree to indemnity and save harmless Teacher Swap Inc. of and from any and all liability for damages and injury to the person or property of another and against and from all suits and actions and all costs and damages resulting from the exchange of homes.\\"   Those who want to be listed in the catalogue pay $42","excerpt":"those who want to browse but not be listed pay $50.    Teacher Swap, Box 454, Oakdale, L.I. 11769; (516) 244-2845. 7,000 Entries With Pictures    The Vacation Exchange Club, which began in 1960, published its 394-page January 1995 book last month. Karl Costabel, who bought the enterprise in 1991 from its founders, David and Mary Ostroff, says there are 7,000 entries, half with pictures. Two-thirds are in Europe; the rest are in North America, Mexico and Hawaii.   A listing, plus the five books for 1995, costs $65; it's $15 more to include a horizontal photo and $20 for a vertical. Listings for a second home cost $10 more. Information submitted by Jan. 14 will appear in the February book. Those subscribing now will get the January book. The catalogue pictures are not captioned, and unless one knows what sort of house to expect, it is not always clear whether the illustration goes with the entry above or below.    Paul G. Foldes, a lawyer in Arlington, Va., has subscribed since 1987. That year, Mr. Foldes said, he swapped his \\"exec home minutes to DC tourist attactions by car, subway, ae, ac, apl, sa, tv, vcr, rr, bc, bi,\\" meaning an auto exchange is possible and the house is air-conditioned, has all domestic appliances, sauna/Jacuzzi/hot tub, television, videocassette recorder, family room, balcony/deck/porch, and a bicycle. In return he got a house in upstate New York, which he and his companion and their children used as a base to see Niagara Falls, Toronto and other places.    The next exchange, he said, came in 1992, when he swapped for three weeks with a couple from Hawaii. He said that he was warned that Hawaii was in such demand he would not get anything for years. \\"But we hit it right away,\\" he said in an interview. \\"A house on the beach at Waikiki.\\" He is trying again, hoping for something in the San Francisco area.    Vacation Exchange Club, Box 650, Key West, Fla. 33041; (800) 638-3841. Link to 12 Groups    The Invented City, in business since 1991, publishes in March, June and November. In 1993 it linked up with 12 other exchange groups under the name International Home Exchange Association. The proprietor, Glenn London, said the active membership is 2,000, and the November supplement included 700 new listings. The deadline for getting into the March edition is Feb. 1. The fee for listing, or subscribing without listing, is $50.    This catalogue, which has no pictures, is easier to read than most: The entries are arrayed across the page instead of appearing in dense columns. The Invented City, 41 Sutter Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94104; (415) 673-0347. A Florida Sideline    The new one on the block is Home Exchange Network, a computer bulletin board service being operated as a sideline by a couple in Florida. This has been running a year. Because they do not yet have much to sell, the vendors, Daniel J. Rubin and his wife, Linda J. Allen, do not charge for membership. Any computer user with a modem can dial (407) 869-5956 and follow the instructions to sign on for a six-month free membership. The listings, one screen each, can be read immediately, and the instructions are easy, even for a bulletin board novice.    Mr. Rubin said most subscribers requested a form to list a house on the bulletin board rather than entering it directly into the computer. The entries may duplicate those in books; Mr. Foldes of Arlington has his house listed on this service, too.    Home Exchange Network, Box 951253, Longwood, Fla. 32791; (407) 862-7211.   The oldest of the groups, Intervac, was founded in 1951 and, with 9,400 subscribers worldwide, says it is the biggest. For a $65 fee, members receive three catalogues a year, published on Dec. 1, March 1 and May 1. Another catalogue is put out in June and is available for an extra $19. There is an $11 charge for including a photo of the property. Houses in 36 countries are listed, including North and Central America, western Europe, and Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The United States branch is run from San Francisco by Paula Jaffe and Lori Horne, who bought the business eight years ago.

(His brother John may have helped on this project.) Never lacking in self-confidence -- the three letters included in THE STAINED GLASS ART OF WILLIAM JAY BOLTON, 1816-1884 (Syracuse University, $49.95) show him to have been a man of nerve as well as wit -- he immediately undertook the enormous program that would constitute his masterpiece, the 60-odd figural windows for the Church of the Holy Trinity (now St. Ann and the Holy Trinity) in Brooklyn Heights","excerpt":"those windows, certainly executed with the help of John, were probably completed by 1848.

Across-the-board raises would be given, but the 15 percent qualified as master teachers would have their pay lifted to almost $25,000 a year. Currently, the average starting salary for teachers in Tennessee is about $12,000 a year. And the average teacher with 20 years' experience makes about $17,000","excerpt":"those with advanced degrees receive a little more.

Ticket scarcity, far-flung theaters, competing screenings -- to say nothing of the star-spotter's problem of scoping out multiple red carpets -- can be daunting even to the seasoned film tourist. The fifth annual Tribeca Film Festival has 174 feature films and 100 shorts from 40 countries. Which means that if you want to attend, you will need a plan. Here are suggestions for how to get the most out of a crowded festival.    GET TICKETS EARLY -- They are available through the festival's Web site (tribecafilmfestival.org), by telephone at (212) 321-7400 (in New York City) or (866) 941-3378 (toll free), at the festival's main box office (13-17B Laight Street, at Canal Street in TriBeCa), and at several theaters. Buying tickets online is the easiest option and cheaper than ordering by telephone. (Both charge a $1 fee per ticket, but another $3 is added to each phone order.) The festival also offers a $150 pass for all weekday screenings before 5 p.m.","excerpt":"those with passes -- any kind, including the $1,000 all-access Hudson Pass and the family passes -- must arrive 30 minutes before showtime. But even if all the advance tickets have been sold, there are often no-shows and cancellations, and those tickets will be resold at the door. Arrive early, and bring reading material.    DEVELOP A GEOGRAPHIC STRATEGY -- The festival's name is misleading. TriBeCa is a tiny Manhattan neighborhood, but screenings are spread throughout Lower Manhattan, with some even farther afield, at AMC Loews theaters at West 34th Street, Broadway at 68th Street and in the East Village (Third Avenue at 11th Street). This means it may not be wise to attempt multiple screenings all over town on the same day; you could wind up with nothing. Check the program guide for clusters of interesting films at one theater or in one area, and join the shortest lines.    YOUR GUIDEBOOK IS YOUR BIBLE -- At 48 pages, it lists all films and includes helpful charts of each day's screenings. It is available at the main box office and at information booths throughout TriBeCa and in several outlying theaters. (A bonus attraction at those booths: free popcorn.)    GET A METROCARD -- Except for some V.I.P.'s, who get shuttle buses, there is no official transportation among theaters. Instead the festival has a particularly New York attitude toward getting around town: the subway is just fine.

In the Giants' 3-1 start, he's now caught 25 passes for 393 yards. He might be the All-Pro tight end this season. And at his locker now, pro football's Rambo even sounded a little like Sylvester Stallone. ''I got to go for an X-ray,'' he mumbled. ''How's your tooth?'' somebody asked. ''I got to go for an X-ray. I'll tell you tomorrow.'' ''How did your tooth get hurt?'' ''I got to go for an X-ray,'' he repeated. He meant a dental X-ray to determine the damage to his tooth. During the game the Giants had feared a fractured jaw","excerpt":"those X-rays were negative. But none of his teammates seemed to know how his tooth had been cracked.   ''I just noticed,'' Phil Simms said, smiling, ''that he was talking funny out there.''

There's always the same sort of publicity flurry, based on the musician's abilities in the jazz and Afro-Cuban idioms and the political and personal bravery it often took to escape. Usually their careers dwindle after a few years as the escape story loses its potency and as the musical limitations become clear.   The latest arrival is Gonzalo Rubalcaba, a 30-year-old Cuban pianist who has moved to the Dominican Republic with the blessings of the Cuban Government. Mr. Rubalcaba has been playing jazz festivals abroad for the last seven years and has had a remarkably fertile recording career, making Latin jazz, jazz and fusion albums for a variety of labels. It's easy to see why a record company might smell money around Mr. Rubalcaba. Not only is Afro-Cuban music blooming in popularity, but Mr. Rubalcaba is a classically trained virtuoso pianist. And even if he does have the blessing of the Cuban Government, he's still performing under a severe limitation: because of stipulations imposed by the United States Government he can't accept a penny of his earnings.

Why do children seem to catch so many more respiratory infections than adults?    A.According to a spokesman for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, there are two basic reasons this seems to be so. First, adults are immune to many such diseases because they already had them as children. For example, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a very common cause of croup and bronchitis in young children. Almost everyone catches it as a child, and cannot catch it again. A bacterium, Hemophilus influenzae, also specializes in children","excerpt":"though it can be a cause of meningitis it is usually far more benign, and again almost everyone has it as a child and is immune afterward.

Along the way he nurses his ancient car, keeps calling home (no answer), picks up a girl hitchhiker, gives her the car and sees her taken into custody at a checkpoint by British soldiers.He continues into Belfast by foot and borrowed rides. He arrives too late for his mother's death but just in time to be arrested under the Special Powers Act, by which suspects may be detained incommunicado and without recourse to judicial proceeding.About the arrest, imprisonment and torture we have known from the beginning, by way of a series of flashes forward that keep interrupting the drive to Belfast. But the reason for the arrest, and whether Sean actually is an exiled revolutionary, we do not know—or at least we are never told. Sean says very little and very little is said about him. \\"U-Turn\\" is full of overheard talk—in pubs, on Dublin streets—but about its central action it is almost silent and very secretive.The characterization of Sean, by Brendon Ellis, enforces a sense of secretiveness, as with shy, slightly sullen persistence he avoids saying what he is about and what, besides his mother's sickness, motivates him. Sean might almost inhabit the private spaces typical of the later films of Robert Bresson, and if \\"U-Turn\\" were a better movie, Bresson's cinema would be a logical comparison.Bresson's cinema is made up not merely of ideas, but also of a marvelously precise judgment for feeling and gesture and of a passion — spiritual or romantic —that there is a point in being secretive about.

One can even overlook the fact that they promoted a soap that practically tore the skin off your body.\\" Ah, the unknown Bergman. He is everywhere in \\"Images: My Life in Film,\\" a series of wry, lucid, ofter harsh reflections on his life's work that was published in Sweden in 1990 but appeared in English translation only three months ago.    New though it is, \\"Images\\" is not the most recent of Mr. Bergman's books to appear here, and it is certainly not the last word on the little Ingmar, \\"considered sullen and too sensitive.\\" It is not easy to keep up with his literary output since he stopped directing feature films in 1982.    \\"Sunday's Children,\\" an exquisite autobiographical film about his boyhood, was written by Mr. Bergman and directed by his 32-year-old son, Daniel. It is now at the Film Forum in the South Village. And Ingmar Berman's novel of \\"Sunday's Children\\" has just been published as well. In the hands of most former film makers, the novel might be a watered-down version of the movie. But \\"Sunday's Children\\" is as elegant, honest and emotinally brutal as \\"Fanny and Alexander\\"","excerpt":"though its scope is slender, this brief novel is a perfectly shaped treasure that stands among the finest work of Mr. Bergman's career.    The freshness of \\"Sunday's Children\\" in both forms is amazing, because Mr. Bergman has written this story before. It exists nearly whole, in subject and shape, in the next-to-last chapter of \\"The Magic Lantern\\" (1987), the first of the autobiographical books that have made Mr. Bergman, now 75, one of the most alluring writers of recent years.    In \\"The Magic Lantern,\\" one July the young Ingmar accompanies his father, Erik, from their country house to a nearby village where Erik Bergman, a minister, is to preach. Ingmar is a Sunday's child, according to folklore, able to see fairies and other visions. He takes the trip with his father by ferry and bicycle, and recalls seeing in the church a stained-glass window depicting \\"Death leading a dance to the Dark Lands, wielding his scythe like a flag.\\" - a picture that would become the final scene of \\"The Seventh Seal\\" and one of the most famouse Bergman images of all. Comically, Ingmar's older brother, Dag, promises to pay him for eating a live worm, then reneges on the offer after the boy with the notoriously fussy stomach has swallowed the creature. These are major incidents in \\"Sunday's Children,\\" too.    More striking, that chapter in \\"The Magic Lantern\\" includes flashes forward in time to the adult Ingmar Bergman visiting his elderly, widowed father. Their relationship is one of fear, anger, coldness. In expanded form, those forward flashes become the harsh emotional underside of the lyrically beautiful \\"Sunday's Children,\\" on screen and on the page.    \\"I am forever living in my childhood,\\" Mr. Bergman writes in \\"Images.\\" As the details of those July days echo from memory through \\"The Magic Lantern\\" on to \\"Sunday's Children,\\" they hold the key to the art of Mr. Bergman's memoirs. He keeps returning to his past, reassessing it, distilling its meaning, offering it to his audience in dazzling new shapes.    In \\"Sunday's Children,\\" the young Ingmar is an 8-year-old called Pu (on screen played by the golden-haired, wide-eyed Henrik Linnros). He is a serious child who both loves and hates his father and is already troubled by the idea of death. When film and novel flash ahead to 1968, the 50-year-old Ingmar is still angry and intransigent on his visits to Erik. In a dizzying swirl of connections between father and son, the middle-aged Ingmar isplayed on screen by Per Myrberg, who looks nothing like the real Mr. Bergman. But his father is played by Thommy Berggren, who as he ages looks quite a bit like Ingmar Bergman today.    Judging the adult Ingmar harshly, Mr. Bergman has made \\"Sunday's Children\\" a huge gesture of reconciliation to his now-dead father. It is also a great gift to his son. (It is easy to speculate that Mr. Bergman's ramshackle personal life, with eight children spread among four wives and one lover, might make usch gestures especially prized.) Daniel Bergman mad children's films and worked for television before filming \\"Sunday's Children,\\" his first feature. When the project was conceived, father and son agreed that Ingmar would write without consulting his son, and Daniel would direct without his father's help. Ingmar Bergman stayed away from the set of \\"Sunday's Children.\\"    The importance of teh screenplay is suggested gy the vast difference between \\"The Best Intentions,\\" the rich, trenchant 1991 film about his parents that was written by Ingmar Bergman and directed by Bille August, and the sprawling fiasco of \\"The House of the Spirits,\\" the current film written and directed by Mr. August. Only the luxurious scenery in those two films is similar.    In \\"Sunday's Children,\\" too, capturing the graceful picturesque quality of two days in the country is the easy part. Daniel Bergman's cinematographer, Tony Forsberg, even substituted for Sven Nykvist on \\"Fanny and Alexander\\" for a few weeks when Mr. Nykvist got the flu.    But Daniel Bergman has done more than create a pretty film that echoes his father's lyricism. Daniel and his actors capture the tormented emotions beneath the picturesque summer in the country. Pu is a darling, sympathetic little boy. \\"Shut your mouth, Pu,\\" his Uncle Carl says. \\"You look stupid with you mouth open.\\" The comment is repeated by Pu's nanny and by Day, but you have to return to \\"Magic Lantern\\" to discover why Pu's mouth is always gaping. Adenoid probglems caused the young Ingmar to breathe through his mouth, \\"which made me look stupid,\\" Mr. Bergman writes.    Pu is also preternaturally serious, like the famously humorless little Ingmar. Both film and novel rely on his relentless questions. Pu keeps asking \\"What?\\" like a nervous tic. When a servant tells a ghost story about a local watchmaker who hanged himself, the tale becomes a fantastic set piece on the page and an eerie black-and-white vision on screen. The watchmaker kills a demonic gradfather clock and a small, fully formed woman who lives inside it. Later, Pu goes to the place where the watchmaker killed himself and asks in a dream, \\"When will I die?\\" The watchmaker answers, \\"Always,\\" and idea that the film maker has carried with him throughout his career.    Similar though the two versions of \\"Sunday's Children\\" are, each makes a unique contribution to the grand mosaic of the Bergman biography. On screen, the adult Ingmar's coldness is more visceral; in the novel the connections between past and present are stronger and more resonant.    When Pu sits on the edge of the ferry and dangles his feet in the water, his father swats him on the head in fury, which leads directly to a flash forward. \\"What did I do wrong?\\" the aged father asks, having discovered his dead wife's diaries, which call their marriage \\"a life-fiasco.\\" The adult Ingmar coldly, even cruelly, tells his father how frightened the family was of his anger. Then he walks away. The scene returns to Pu and his father, who apologizes for pulling the child away from his dangerous perch on the ferry so violently. \\"I was scared,\\" he says. \\"When you're scared, you get angry.\\" The explanation goes back to \\"The Magic Lantern\\" and to the heart of the Bergman family's anger and unhappiness. Pu, having overheard his parents arguing, fears that his father will leave; Erik fears losing his wife; over the years, Ingmar's anger becomes implacable.    Mr. Bergman deftly positions his leaps in time to reflect backward and forward, so the present illuminates the past and the past explains the present. On screen, when the camera returns from 1968 to Pu's boyhood, the flashes forward almost seem to have been prophetic visions of this Sunday's child. On the page, the effect is the opposite, as the voice of Ingmar Bergman today is heard shaping his past.    On their way home from the sermon, Pu and his father are caught in a storm. The father puts his coat around Pu, and the story jumps ahead to Erik Bergman's deathbed. Erik whispers a blessing on his son, who is unable to understand what his father is mumbling. As the story returns to the past. Erik once more puts his coat around Pu, echoing the gesture of blessing. \\"Sunday's Children\\" itself is a blessing that Ingmar Bergman has bestowed on Daniel. This son had the good sense and talent to appreciate the gift and turn it into an enduring Bergman film.

He is concerned with Brian, a winner of an O. Henry short story award, who has been living with Genie, a fresh and youthful ballerina who obviously adores both his hopes and the ground he walks on.

His lady fair is anxious for marriage and is in a family way but loath to tell her lover.This is the crux of Mr. O'Connell's theme and it is treated in serious and, occasionally, comic views. And he must be credited with resolving it in a mature manner.Life, Mr. O'Connell apparently has learned, is real and earnest and happy Hollywood endings occur only on the West Coast.His leads and the supporting players, most of whom have had experience in the theater and television, behave, for the most part, naturally and unaffectedly. There are many evidences of amateurism, but these may be forgiven for the obvious sincerity they contribute to their assignments.Melinda Plank, an authentic ballerina who has never acted in any medium, has the face and figure of a nubile beauty. She looks and acts the role of a young girl torn by the searing problems of life and love.

A poised but sharp-toothed first collection of stories about Americans abroad, mostly privileged young women","excerpt":"though they have, or used to have, parents and lovers, their primary loyalties are to their own memories.    HEAVENLY DAYS, by James Wilcox. (Viking, $23.95.) A delicious novel, balanced between hilarity and pathos. Its valiant, stubbornly forgiving heroine gets everything wrong at first; her warm, sensitive husband is really a rigid, crew-cut, fetish-ridden compulsive who has moved out of the house without her noticing it.    WAXWINGS, by Jonathan Raban. (Pantheon, $24.) Both a kind of historical novel and domestic drama, ''Waxwings,'' set in Seattle in 1999, ostensibly concerns a writer accused of child abduction, but its most real presence is a Chinese contractor, an illegal immigrant who bosses a team of illegal Mexicans.    SAUL AND PATSY, by Charles Baxter. (Pantheon, $24.) Circumstances, alternately aggravating and ameliorating, seem to be in control of a young married-with-baby couple's life in this quite irreverent novel, which shows throughout a healthy contempt for youth and its sometimes forthright admiration of self.    AMERICA'S WOMEN: Four Hundred Years of Dolls, Drudges, Helpmates and Heroines, by Gail Collins. (Morrow, $27.95.) From Eleanor Dare (Virginia's mother) to Betty Friedan, a celebration not so much about how women have shaped America but vice versa, especially when national adversity offered the chance to expand their ambits and horizons.    GREAT FORTUNE: The Epic of Rockefeller Center, by Daniel Okrent. (Viking, $29.95.) Nobody loved it in 1929, when it was still only an idea; now it's more of an ideal, an integrated cityscape that works. Okrent retells some old stories very well, and displays a large cast of visionaries, artisans and schemers who were present at the creation.    THE UNPROFESSIONALS, by Julie Hecht. (Random House, $23.95.) The narrator of Julie Hecht's first novel, a photographer of some repute and the owner of a tone of voice that mocks her own narcissism, suffers a feeling of disensoulment, a consequence of her long attachment to a man much younger than herself who has committed suicide.    WHERE I WAS FROM, by Joan Didion. (Knopf, $23.) In a revisionary assessment of her home and her opinions, Didion gives up on California and its inhabitants, including her own pioneer family; she now sees the state's history as a fiasco, a saga of advancement with other people's money, chiefly the government's, spent on behalf of business interests.
