The heart of the program's early-music section was a group of Ave Maria settings, including two works (in four and six voices) by Josquin and one each by Vittoria and Arcadelt.

Here the players strive to do the thing properly, to look as if they were at the top of the social ladder, quite snobbish in fact, and their efforts are far from convincing.William Conklin has luck with him, for he is in the first chapter a policeman, and seventeen or eighteen years later is a successful contractor. All he has to do is to change his clothes. Cullen Landis, however, is called upon to officiate as one of those nice young billionaires who go into a shop on the east side and are struck by the beauty of the heroine. Our hero does not want it known that he lives in a mansion, so he wears his chauffeur's uniform and has to pretend to be his own driver. This Victor McQuade drives an expensive car over the rough roads of the squalid tenement district to call upon Rosie (Shirley Mason). The appearance of the car attracts considerable attention, but Rosie, who is, of course, quite at home in a small shop or in a castle, leans back on the seat enjoying the ride with her new sweetheart.It is to be presumed that all is not going to run placidly for Rosie, for there is the inevitable girl Victor was going to marry before be set eyes on Rosie.Victor, who has to do the wrong thing sometimes, drives to his own home, where they are holding a ragtag ball. Somehow or other Victor strays away and dances with the girl he does not want to marry, and during his absence Rosie, who stole into the house, is told that she has won the leather medal.

The city has witnessed the development of a singular photographic style that features more or less candid pictures of its varied street life, usually depicted in stark black and white. The style, which developed in the 1930's and continues today, has included among its practitioners such luminaries as Diane Arbus, Robert Frank, Helen Levitt and Bruce Davidson.    Two current shows focus attention on earlier examples of this rich style, which combines the bluntness of newspaper photography with the documentary approach that became popular in the first decades of the century. The Pace/MacGill Gallery is presenting a selection of work by Weegee, one of the prime shapers of the style, while at the Sander Gallery, a small show called \\"Troubled Times . . .\\" features the work of Lisette Model, Louis Faurer and Leon Levinstein, three later adherents.

In fact, the direction is so clear and the work of the leading characters so good that hardly any conversation is needed to show the audience the conflict raging in the breast of the handsome young member of the ruling class (Hr. Berglund) who joins the Red forces, partly out of conviction and largely because of his love for an attractive Russian girl (Ingert Bjuggren). After breaking with his proud mother (Gerda Lundequist) and his brother (Uno Henning), the hero is captured by the White army and sentenced to be shot at 7 o'clock the next morning. His brother, a White officer, paroles him until that time, and he gallops away to try to see his mother and his sweetheart. How that one night is spent keeps the spectators interested, despite the threadbare quality of the theme.This is one of the best Swedish films to reach the screen in New York. The photography and sound reproduction are clear, the scenes at the old gristmill, where the girl lives, and on the estate of the aristocratic family are well done and have an air of authenticity and the picture poses no particular problem.

Despite this, argues Brooks Johnson, the curator of photography at the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Va., historians have tended to give Gardner less than his full due as a recorder of the war.

This novel's narrator, based on Paul de Man, the esteemed scholar who was exposed after his death for writing anti-Semitic articles during the Nazi era, is an elderly widower living in California. When a young researcher tells him she has unearthed his wartime journalism, he arranges to meet her in Turin, but there is a secret beyond his secret: he never wrote the articles, but assumed the identity of the author to escape occupied Europe. Last year our reviewer, Bruce Bawer, found ''Shroud'' a ''hypnotic'' book in which ''Banville seeks to raze icons and uncover truths.''    IRIS ORIGO: Marchesa of Val d'Orcia, by Caroline Moorehead. (Godine, $19.95.) An Anglo-American heiress who married an Italian aristocrat and restored a primitive rural estate in Tuscany, and who wrote elegantly on many subjects, Iris Origo (1902-88) was a cosmopolite of vast energy as well as a generous (and anonymous) philanthropist who helped partisans and prisoners escape Mussolini's Fascism. ''Moorehead's fascinating biography'' charts the ''glamorous, loaded, unsettled life'' of an ''enchanting person,'' Nicholas Fox Weber wrote here in 2002.    THE DEEP: And Other Stories, by Mary Swan. (Random House, $12.95.) The high point of this first collection of short fiction by a promising Canadian writer is the 68-page title story, which tells of a tightly entwined pair of identical twin sisters who leave their isolated home in Canada to work as volunteers in France at the end of World War I. ''The narrative is electrified'' by its ''audacious double voice,'' Andrea Barrett said here last year, and elsewhere the author ''explores a number of different forms with varying results, succeeding most brilliantly at those that seem the most difficult.''    JOHN PAUL JONES: Sailor, Hero, Father of the American Navy, by Evan Thomas. (Simon & Schuster, $14.) His career during the American Revolution may have had as many missteps as triumphs, but John Paul Jones embodied the brash, reckless and ornery spirit of his adopted nation (he was born a Scot). Taking the fight to the enemy's own shores, he used what might today be called terrorist tactics to settle personal scores against the British. The result is a ''penetrating biography'' and ripping yarn, Nathaniel Philbrick wrote here in 2003.    IN PRAISE OF NEPOTISM: A History of Family Enterprise From King David to George W. Bush, by Adam Bellow. (Anchor, $16.) Although, as the son of the novelist Saul Bellow, the author admits that his ''objectivity may be questioned,'' he succeeds in canvassing much of Western history (not to mention Confucian and Hindu traditions) to argue that kinship is ''both natural and necessary.'' Though uneven, his account is ''thorough'' and some of his examples ''surprising,'' Rob Walker wrote here in 2003.    MORTALS, by Norman Rush. (Vintage International, $15.95.) The author of two previous fictional works set in Africa -- ''Whites'' (1986) and ''Mating'' (1991) -- Rush returns again with this outsize black comedy whose hero is a Milton scholar, teacher, besotted spouse and C.I.A. agent, in no particular order, and whose wife may be taking up with a black American doctor bent on de-Christianizing the continent. ''From six years with the Peace Corps in Botswana, Norman Rush has now produced three books so full of brainwork, contour, sinew and laser light that we don't want to leave home without him: we would never notice or feel as much,'' John Leonard wrote here last year.    THE PROBABLE FUTURE, by Alice Hoffman. (Ballantine, $13.95.) Hoffman's 16th novel covers comfortably familiar territory: a New England village resonating with three centuries of history and tragedy","excerpt":"a clan of self-reliant and magically gifted women; and a romantic tale flecked with sensual detail and Gothic touches in which no plot thread is left untied. ''It feels like a vacation to curl up with this fairy tale,'' Janice P. Nimura said here last year.    TRUE BELIEVERS: The Tragic Inner Life of Sports Fans, by Joe Queenan. (Picador, $13.) The author offers up both a Miss Manners-type guide to the best and worst of fandom and a paean to the spirit of his hometown, Philadelphia, a city with more than its share of hard-luck sports teams and fans who hate them. ''Queenan aptly identifies, pathologizes and lampoons every form of loutish and insufferable behavior that plagues big-time athletics today,'' Tobin Harshaw wrote here in 2003.

Mr. Matura has moved J. M. Synge's \\"extravagant comedy,\\" originally set in the County Mayo of 1907, to Mayaro, Trinidad, in 1950. As boisterously animated at the Mitzi E.

Even so, the script, which has been widely produced since its premiere in 1984, is clever and sometimes legitimately amusing. Mr. Matura is an elegant writer whose other plays can recall the novels of his fellow Trinidadian V. S. Naipaul in their ironic political undertow. Here he so faithfully and musically translates the rich Irish language of the original text into a lilting Caribbean patois that his verbal ingenuity recalls Richard Wilbur's stunning English translations of Moliere.

Fifi is in love with Owen McDonald, a childhood sweetheart, and he is accused of the murder. Her son, too, believes that she and McDonald have conspired to murder his father.In order to clear herself in her son's eyes Fifi goes to Oliver Bedlow, the family attorney, whom she had previously dismissed from her home because he had accused McDonald, to beg forgiveness and to ask him to restore her son's confidence in her. He locks the doors and confesses he killed her husband because of his great love for her. Then he suggests a suicide pact. She refuses, and he jumps forty stories to the street as rescuers break through to save Fifi.The story is unsubstantial and hinges on the popular murder mystery device, the solution of which is neither startling nor entertaining. H. B.

It was a stupendous piece of drama: brilliance and gloom, victory and death, saintly sacrifice and inconsolable sorrow set side by side, the sunlit sky of the imperial future banishing the grim clouds of past dissatisfactions. The public adored grandstanding performances and responded to this one with rapture.

In fact, although he is younger than Jackie Coogan was when he made his bow with Chaplin in \\"The Kid,\\" Master Lee begets something like the same admiration and feeling aroused by his successful predecessor, and he is a far better child actor than any of the youngsters who have appeared since the younthful Coogan's day.There was many a rousing outburst or laughter at a word or two from the diminutive Davey. His childish speech was not always distinct, but what he said might not have been understood in real life. However, whether or not one understood his lines, they nevertheless carried a strong appeal to one's heart. It might almost be said that he is good-natured, for he appeared to enjoy all his work in the picture, and those who see him saying his prayers will not easily forget his line as he asks God to bless his mother and father, and then adds that he is too tired to think of all the others. So off he goes to slumberland.It is really amazing to perceive a child so young who can smile through all the hectic action in this farcical arrangement. Davey is perceived in one scene playing with a toy train, and when his Aunt Winifred, acted by the personable Betty Bronson, promises to take him on a real chu-chu, he lifts up his eyes, as if he really means it, and asks:\\"Can I depend upon that?\\"Although there are a few loop holes in this tale, it is none the less a thoroughly enjoyable entertainment. Seldom have such gales of laughter greeted a part-talking picture as were heard last night during some of the comic situations. Mary, impersonated by Gertrude Olmstead, is Sonny Boy's mother. Her husband, Hamilton, is suing for a divorce, and to prevent the father taking the child away, Mary asks for the assistance of her sister, Winifred. Sonny Boy (Davey Lee) is therefore hidden in a clothes basket, and through a ruse Winifred succeeds in getting him out of the house. First they go to the railway depot, but, on overhearing that Hamilton's lawyer is leaving his apartment vacant, Winifred decides to take Sonny Boy there. She poses as the lawyer's wife and it is not long before the lawyer's father and mother call. These old folks are naturally astounded to learn that their son has a wife, and when they see the winsome Winifred, they take her in their arms, wondering how the husband can leave her for a\\" month.Matters become rather involved when the lawyer, Crandall Thorpe, turns up on the scene, having missed his train through further discussion of Hamilton's marital problems. Sonny Boy has a lively time, what with being covered up with the bed clothes, then told to hide under the bed and eventually bidden to put on his clothes.Edward Everett Horton is amusing as Thorpe, despite the fact that his lines are not always aptly written. Miss Bronson is captivating as Winifred, and her voice registers quite well. It is, however, a mistake to have the characters talking one moment and then suddenly bound over to silence, as they are in this film. Miss Olmstead is pleasing as Sonny Boy's mother. John T. Murray plays the husband who is a victim of hayfever, and he overdoes the sneezing even for a farce-comedy.Phil Baker appears with a concertina in a short Vitaphone film, entitled \\"A Bad Boy From a Good Family.\\" He is spontaneous in his infectious drollery.

If only the lines of its narration were as vivid and entangling as its style, this strange work, known in Sweden as \\"Syskonbadd 1782,\\" might be classed with some of Ingmar Bergman's films.For it does boil around in an area of the workings of conscience and tabu, of people obeying that impulse and then being tortured by the thought of what they've done, that involved the interest of Bergman in his \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" especially. And it rings in a strain of mysticism such as one usually finds in Bergman films.Its morbid contemplation of the consequences of a wild, incestuous love between a twin brother and sister back in the 18th century, when that sort of thing was forbidden not only by social tabus but also by dread of deformity and insanity in any possible progeny, goes on and on through several phases of personal vilification and despair, and concludes in an anatomical climax that is one of the weirdest I've ever seen.As the brother and sister who alternately love and hate—who try \\"to live without God and the Devil\\" and find it impossible—Per Oscarsson and Bibi Andersson do beautifully brash and bizarre things, embrace and untangle and spew emotion in riotous living all over the place. Jarl Kulle, the agile Captain of last year's successful \\"Dear John\\", has a diametrically opposite role this time as the austere Baron who takes the sister as his wife. He is handsomely and pompously unsettled by confusion and jealousy, without actually letting the audience know exactly how he feels. Likewise Gunnar Bjornstrand, one of Bergman's favorite actors, appears magnificently classy as a morally hypocritical Count.There are others who involve themselves mysteriously in the elegant and seamy goings-on—a spry girl played by Tina Hedstrom, who lusts after Mr. Oscarsson","excerpt":"a clutter of grandly costumed worldlings who adorn the social scene; a rabble of tavern trollops with whom the profligate hero consorts, and a sullen and mystical old midwife and her darkly rumored imbecile son.Mr. Sjoman has put them through paces in a strikingly bold, insistent style and with sharp stunts of cinematic riveting to catch attention and angle emphasis. For instance, he has one entire scene of a couple making love with the camera trained the whole time on a kitten walking warily around the room. A peeping tomcat, as it were.But unfortunately the story—the main narration—remains obscure. Too many lines are tossed forward and never caught and made fast. People are swirled in turmoils of love, passion, hate and despair. But all we know at the finish is that incest is bad. Well, it isn't good. The dialogue is in Swedish with English subtitles.

Like the characters who ramble amiably through this sprawling, funny, emotionally raw 1978 film -- which has a style that's of a piece with the director's other long films of the 70's, among them \\"Minnie and Moskowitz\\" (1971), \\"A Woman Under the Influence\\" (1974) and \\"The Killing of a Chinese Bookie\\" (1976) -- Mr. Cassavetes displays a remarkably free-spirited point of view.   \\"Opening Night\\" is a reminder of what has made Mr. Cassavetes's films so appealing, and of what can make them so maddening, too. For all its length -- nearly two and three-quarter hours -- it's a relatively thin example of the director's work, but a mischievous and inviting one, too.   Gena Rowlands, at her most radiant, totters through the film in the role of Myrtle Gordon, a very famous actress who requires vast reserves of forbearance from anyone who's daring or foolhardy enough to try working with her. As the film begins, Myrtle is in New Haven starring in the final tryouts of a play called \\"The Second Woman,\\" which is, if God is willing and Myrtle can be held in check, on its way to Broadway.   Overseeing the production, and collectively gnashing their teeth when they are not sweet-talking the star, are the play's seasoned director, Manny Victor (Ben Gazzara), and his playful wife (Zohra Lampert), who good-naturedly tells him, \\"If I had known what a boring man you were when I married you, I wouldn't have gone through all those emotional crises\\"","excerpt":"a co-star named Maurice Aarons (Mr. Cassavetes), with whom Myrtle goes back a long time; the playwright Sarah Goode (Joan Blondell), who has more reason to worry about Myrtle than anyone else, and the producer David Samuels (Paul Stewart), Sarah's husband, the one who's most apt to bring down the curtain once and for all. Second most apt, actually, since Myrtle is doing everything she can to bring on a disaster.   Miss Rowlands, as she has shown in other films directed by her husband, can be incomparably funny while coming apart at the seams. The film, which presents bits and pieces of the play in rehearsal and then gradually lets them evolve into something whole, has a lot of fun with Myrtle's improvisations onstage and their unfortunate effects on her fellow actors.   As in \\"All About Eve,\\" the star's secret fear turns out to be a dread of the aging process, which in this case is the subject of the play she's trying to do; Sarah, the author, says the phrase \\"the second woman\\" refers to the person a woman becomes once the pretty, youthful side of her disappears. Myrtle has so much trouble with this idea that she hallucinates a dead fan (Laura Johnson), who has been hit by a car early in the film but returns to haunt Myrtle as a vision of her own lost youth. This device, typically for Mr. Cassavetes, is labored and attenuated but strangely touching anyhow.   When Joan Blondell was making \\"Opening Night\\" in 1977, she told an interviewer, \\"I couldn't tell when the actors were having a private conversation and when they were actually changing the lines of the script.\\" The shifting-sands quality that colors Myrtle's performances onstage also extends to the actors in the film, but the cast has a vibrancy that is perhaps a byproduct of this kind of uncertainty. As always, Mr. Cassavetes, a figure of wry, unpredictable intelligence and uncertain temper, is as darkly commanding in front of the camera as he is behind it.

Behind the News -- The flight was the shuttle system's first in a year, and only the second since the Columbia disintegrated on re-entry in 2003, killing the seven-member crew. In this launching there appeared to be no major damage from foam insulation falling off the shuttle's external fuel tank, a problem that had doomed Columbia and that had cropped up again on the flight a year ago. But if NASA seemed to have taken care of one headache, it faced longer-term ones: how to re-establish a presence in space with a diminished shuttle fleet that is expected to be retired in 2010, and how to fight a perception that its programs, particularly the space station, lack purpose.    NORH KOREA    The News -- North Korea went on a rocket-launching spree, firing at least seven missiles over the Sea of Japan, including one that is designed to be able to reach Alaska.    Behind the News -- The long-range missile, the Taepodong 2, failed or was aborted shortly after launching and fell into the Sea of Japan. But some United States officials said even a failure would provide some valuable information for the North Koreans, who seem intent on developing a long-range missile capability. The White House, which had long ignored Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, has more recently tried to engage him in diplomacy, urging international support for strong measures, including sanctions, to get the country to drop its weapons program. But China and Russia resisted the move.    THE MIDDLE EAST    The News -- Hamas militants fired a small rocket deeper into Israel, prompting the Israeli military to move farther into Gaza.    Behind the News -- The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, called the Qassam rocket fired from Gaza that landed in Ashkelon, a city of 115,000 six miles from the Gaza border, an ''escalation without precedent.'' It and the other launchings were also evidence that the Israeli strategy of positioning troops just inside Gaza was ineffective. So the military moved farther into the territory, taking up positions near abandoned Israeli settlements. Prime Minister Olmert faced a delicate balancing act: pushing militarily against Hamas while trying to get the organization, and its military wing, to release a captured Israeli soldier.    WASHINGTON    The News -- Central Intelligence Agency officials said the agency had closed a unit that had hunted for Osama bin Laden.    Behind the News -- The disbanding of the unit, which had been in operation since long before the Sept. 11 attacks, is a sign of increased concern that other groups have begun carrying out attacks independent of Mr. bin Laden, and that Al Qaeda is a more decentralized organization than it once was. Agency officials said that while efforts to capture Mr. bin Laden were as strong as ever, the better plan was to focus on regional trends rather than specific individuals or groups. But one former senior C.I.A. official said the closing would hurt the search for the Qaeda leader.    ATLANTA    The News -- Federal agents in Atlanta foiled a plot to sell Coca-Cola Company secrets to PepsiCo.

Everybody today knows his posters of La Goulue high-stepping at the Moulin Rouge, and of Aristide Bruant of Le Mirliton in his black cape and hat and his signature scarf. You don't have to have come across them in museums  or books, because they've been banalized on cocktail napkins and souvenir ashtrays so many times that they were long ago swallowed up, along with the Eiffel Tower and the Mona Lisa, in the great collective morass of popular culture.         But the public's warm embrace of Lautrec belies the cold and often pitiless treatment he gave to demimonde Paris. Look closely and you can come away from the show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which features 115 works by Lautrec  from the museum's collection, wondering about this contradiction. Has there been a crueler artist than Lautrec? No. Neither illustrators like the mid-19th-century satirist Paul Gavarni, to whom Lautrec owes a debt, as he does  to Degas and Daumier, nor anyone since Lautrec's time quite competes on the cruelty level.

Ideally, it should be possible to relish this fascinating movie on its own. But, since so little French history of the nineteen-thirties is provided, it's likely to send you flying to the library. (\\"Stavisky\\" isn't perplexing just to Americans","excerpt":"a colleague reports that a Parisian audience was also bewildered.) The movie opened last night at the New York Film Festival and will be repeated tonight. It doesn't yet have a commercial release—but it will be startling if it's denied one.Briefly the real Stavisky was an entrepreneur, an impresario and an accomplished swindler who bribed politicians, the police, the courts and the press; he also squandered all of his own wealth. When he flooded France with fake vouchers in 1932, the banks were closed. As a result, there were violent street riots early in 1933, in which a number of persons were shot by the police. The Government could no longer rely on the loyalty of the army or the police, and Premier Edouard Daladier was forced to resign. (Stavisky himself appears to have been an apolitical adventurer, although he had a megalomaniacal belief that he could solve the economic problems of Europe—and also end unemployment. Apparently, the press dwelled on the fact that he was a Russian Jew, and the fascist agents in France exploited the anti-Semitic issue by insisting that foreign crooks were out to ruin the nation.The movie mutes the last point, but the characterization of Stavisky seems very faithful to the accounts of the period. He appears as a dual personality: a graceful bon vivant who luxuriates in every conceivable pleasure and an acute melancholic. There's a charming moment when he explains the difference between happiness and pleasure: he says that happiness can occur in a single moment, but that pleasure requires a huge investment of time — and that it's available only to the rich. He's also obsessed by suicides and by mysterious deaths. He was once a scruffy hood, but his friends remark that his present self despises his past one.As Stavisky, whom a journalist of the thirties called \\"a gentleman among gangsters and a gangster among gentlemen,\\" Jean-Paul Belmondo is at his best. Despite the tycoon's grandeur, he still breaks into a mobster's strut: arms swinging, wearing his shoulders high, he lunges forward with his torso aslant, while his respectable companions walk erect. Mr. Belmondo has all the authority and the gaiety of the man who refused to believe that he could make a mistake. But although others later call him crazy, we don't really see that aspect of his nature — perhaps because of the stubborn sanity that Mr. Belmondo brings to even his loopier roles.Charles Boyer is effortlessly elegant and supple as a baron who enjoyed Stavisky's company. The eyebrows rise delicately above those knowing eyes, and it's a treat to watch him playing with Mr. Belmondo: They seem to greet each other across the span of movie history. Anny Duperey at first appears as a brittle, expensive moll; she then emerges as a sympathetic person. The teasing, troubling musical score by Stephen Sondheim and the stunning art deco interiors suit the subject to perfection. There is also an engaging use of the theater: A reading from Jean Giradoux's \\"Intermezzo\\" and a performance of \\"Coriolanus\\" gently distill the themes of disorder and death.As usual, Mr. Resnais flirts with time: Here, there are many flash-forwards—mainly to a parliamentary committee, where witnesses testify about the Stavisky case. Most of these leaps into the future work very well, although there are a few too many of them. Less successful is the insertion of Leon Trotsky. Both he and Stavisky were exiles, but since their lives never touched, the revolutionary's appearance in the movie is unsettling. (Also, one wishes that the riots had been filmed — but perhaps they were omitted due to expense.) Meanwhile, despite its mystifications, \\"Stavisky\\" is one of the most rewarding films I've seen this year—and also one of the most intelligent.

Presumably the idea was that much music that did not literally use traditional tonal harmony created its tensions and resolutions with large, vaguer areas of harmonic force. Albert may have written his Second Symphony as an example. It was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic and received its premiere during the weekend's series of subscription concerts conducted by Hugh Wolff. Albert completed a short score before his death, indicating about half the instrumentation","excerpt":"a colleague, Sebastian Currier, felt very little else was required and orchestrated the piece based on his knowledge of Albert's style.   Much of Albert's previous music was inspired by literary texts, including his Pulitzer Prize-winning \\"Riverrun\\" (1984). The Second Symphony, though, is a piece of absolute, abstract music. Its three movements last about a half-hour, during which there are identifiable key regions. The third -- a familiar interval in tonal music -- gives the work much of its coloration. There are even, here and there, tonal melodies that echo late Romanticism. The work is full of allusions to earlier styles, including both Mahler (in the sarcastic-sounding second movement) and Copland (in the elegiac passages of the last). The label neo-Romantic was often applied to Albert; this piece deserves to be called his Neo-Romantic Symphony.

It is hard because we assume that everything has been said about it (and, really, very little has been said), because we have never, despite a lot of propaganda to the contrary, achieved an articulate respect for erotic impulses, and because critical response still favors big subjects over little ones, public event over private nuance. Thus the paradox of a critical establishment that two years ago proclaimed, to pick at random, \\"Medium Cool\\" as significant cinema and now complains that it is being \\"manipulated\\" (a favorite word) by \\"Love Story.\\"And thus it would be easy to demolish Michel Boisrond's \\"The Tender Moment,\\" which opened yesterday at the 34th Street East. A musical score, piano and orchestra, (Francis Lai) so corny it might make Elmer Bernstein blush","excerpt":"a collection of attractive occupations and preoccupations for the characters that is as self-evidently stage decoration as are the interiors of the terrific or, at the very least, charming apartments in which everybody lives—all of it eyewash or earwash and all of it as traditional, as conventional and potentially moving as, say, the pastoral conceit in lyric poetry of the Renaissance.Olivier (Renaud Verley), the young protagonist of \\"The Tender Moment,\\" is more of a literary extremist, preferring Eluard or Middle English love poetry—with both of which he courts Frédérique (Nathalie Delon), an older woman of 25 and mistress of an even older racing car driver (Robert Hossein), who has so far given up the ghost, he'd as soon marry the girl. Olivier meets Frédérique over a traffic violation, follows her to a fabulous Alpine ski resort, where he beds her (Hossein is off racing the Indianapolis 500), returns with her to Paris, neglects his studies, leaves home, wins his woman—and finally gives her back to her lover—whose claim is not only prior but, Olivier realizes, considerably more permanent.What one derives from this material, aside from the pleasures of its various wish fulfillments, has a lot to do with how one responds to the manner of a pickup, to the understanding of a first night, to the whole drama of sexual attraction. For it is in such matters that Boisrond reveals his skill, his reticence, his decency, his feeling for a kind of psychological truth that is uncluttered either by earthshaking revelation or moral condemnation. His understanding of people in love, like his employment of the pathetic fallacy (a fine rain storm at the end to accompany Olivier's self-exile), belongs to a series of minor victories in very ordinary modes. But the victories, if small, win valuable ground, and they are why \\"The Tender Moment,\\" for all its no surprises, is a refreshing experience.The cast is serviceable, if undistinguished, and Nathalie Delon (Alain Delon's wife) happily suggests healthy appetites in the kind of role that too often feeds on Victorian mush. The minor parts (especially Bernard Le Coq as a pal and beautiful Katia Cristina as Olivier's family's all-purpose live-in maid) are especially well-handled.

In its careful placing of modern art in a natural setting, Storm King is unique: the museum consists of a restored Normandy-chateau-style building at the top of a hill, nestled between two mountains, and more than 200 acres of landscaped gardens, forests and fields filled with monumental sculptures by many of this century's greatest artists.

By Paula Wolfert.  Illustrated. 356 pp. New York: The Dial Press/Doubleday & Co. $24.95.     This has been a lean year for memorable cookbooks. Few contain the kinds of exciting recipes that leap off the pages demanding to be cooked. Even fewer contain the riveting prose or gorgeous pictures that keep armchair cooks awake nights. And at prices hovering around $20 or more for most of them, that is the least to which the purchaser is entitled. Among the limited number that are likely to become a permanent part of the serious and accomplished cook's library is ''The Cooking of South-West France'' by Paula Wolfert.   Mrs. Wolfert spent five years perfecting the recipes she gathered from both professional chefs and ordinary housewives. She has revised them to eliminate much of the fat notorious in the cooking of that region without destroying their integrity, and she has succeeded admirably. Considerable space has been devoted to the innovative techniques she has developed to accomplish this purpose. ''The great cliche about the dishes of the South-West,'' Mrs. Wolfert writes, ''is that they are good but heavy and therefore not healthful. I disagree emphatically, and I have made a special effort in this book to include recipes that have been lightened.''

In the late 1960's, Mr. Christensen was a rising star in the Color Field, or Formalist, painting firmament. His work appeared in Artforum magazine when he was only 26 years old and in two Whitney Biennials before he was 30. He was famous for making his abstract paintings with a spray gun, looping lines of hazy color into repeating, Slinky-like configurations that had a stylish leanness and a soft optical buzz.   By the mid-70s, the Color Field's light had dimmed and, with it, Mr. Christensen's. Although he continued to exhibit his work regularly, it became less original, and less noticed. It followed the lead of other Color Field painters, especially Jules Olitski, as they turned to thickly troweled paint in the quest for pure abstraction and the elimination of spatial illusion.

And, though the achievements of Soviet youth dominate the proceedings, propaganda, as voiced by the English-speaking narrator, is kept in a minor key.With reportedly 10,000 delegates representing eighty nations as the nucleus for the 250,000 persons who took part in the festival, cameras caught a wealth of color in costumes, including Mongolian, African, Bulgarian, Norwegian, Chinese, Indo-Chinese and the varied dress of the more exotic peoples of the U.

Review/Theater","excerpt":"A Comedy From London Reopens With Changes"},{"year":"1931","title":"The Technicolor production \\"The Run Around,\\" which is now at Warners' Strand, begins with flashes of stage beauties and closes with a prolonged sequence of a church marriage ceremony. It is presumed that this ending means the happiness of Evelyn, the dancing girl bride, and Frederick Stanhope White, a wealthy young man who has sown his share of wild oats.It is a comedy, and therefore the strange behavior of the characters is to be excused at times. The director, William J. Craft, has filmed most of his scenes with an eye on the prismatic angle. When Evelyn and Frederick indulge in a tête-à-tête meal in the girl's apartment the hues of the edibles and beverages are not forgotten. Some of the coloring is quite good, but now and again there are scenes that are out of focus, which has happened in previous natural-color features.Besides the pastel shades, there is a generous smattering of slang. Margy, as one of the footlights favorites is known, refers to flowers as \\"spinach\\" and to the young women, hitherto known as \\"gold-diggers,\\" as \\"platinum snatchers\\" and \\"bobbed-winged angels.\\"Evelyn, played by Mary Brian, is quite unlike her feminine friends. She actually refuses a thousand-dollar bracelet because it has the donor's apartment key attached to it. And it is quite a long while before she permits Frederick to kiss her. Margie, however, is a crafty young creature, and in the course of the narrative she enlists the services of Lou, a vaudeville comedian, to pose as Evelyn's father. When he appears upon the scene he takes it for granted that his \\"daughter\\" is married to Frederick, never giving the young man a chance to explain.Joseph Cawthorn gives a capital portrayal as Lou, whose deception eventually is uncovered.Geoffrey Kerr does what he can with the part of Frederick. Miss Brian is attractive as Evelyn. Johnny Hines endeavors to add to the none-too-effective fun. Marie Prevost appears to enjoy the impersonation of Margy.The sixth episode of Bobby Jones's screen golf lessons is on the surrounding program. It deals with the brassie, and it is a joy to look at Mr. Jones's swing, particularly in the slow-motion scenes. This brief offering is both informative and amusing.

There is also the familiar traffic jam, this time brought about by a young man who forgets that he is wearing a policeman's uniform.The characters in this production are invariable afflicted with deafness and some of them are apparently extremely short-sighted. Two men take plenty of punishment, but they soon appear without the least sign of the struggle.Most of the absurd antics are concerned with a young man who borrows a policeman's uniform. This surprisingly unintelligent youth often fails to remember that he at least resembles a minion of the law. He encounters a pretty girl and all thoughts of traffic vanish, as he spoons with the dainty creature. In the meantime the real policeman is pacing the floor of his apartment sans uniform.

George Sarret (Michel Piccoli) is a former World War I hero, now a lawyer with a way of seizing the unexpected opportunity at a moment's notice.When Philomene and Catherine enter his life, George begins to plan things with care. He premeditates. He is the architect of what becomes their (mostly) astonishing good fortune. Their game: insurance fraud and murder.\\"Le Trio Infernal,\\" which opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie Theater, is an elegantly acted, handsome-looking French film, a macabre comedy with serious intentions that ultimately prevent it from being as funny as one longs for it to be.Philomene and George are made for each other, both being ambitious, calculating, venal and, when the occasion requires, horrendously vicious. Compared with these two, Catherine, the younger sister, is an old-fashioned sentimentalist.She doesn't mind sharing George with Philomene, and she doesn't object to George's marrying each of them off in turn to an elderly husband who is then quickly insured and dispatched in one way or anotherHowever, Catherine does become all weepy on Christmas Eve, when George, strictly according to plan, shoots their two dinner guests, a pushy, opinionated, overfed pawnbroker (Andrea Ferreol) and the pawnbroker's timid lover (Hubert Deschamps).Catherine becomes so upset she can hardly help lug the bodies up to the bathroom, where they are to be dissolved in sulphuric acid. A couple of days later, when it's time to ladle the contents out of each bathtub, Catherine gets sick to her stomach. In the context of these goings-on, Catherine is a silly goose.\\"Le Trio Infernal\\" is the first feature to be directed by a new French director named Francis Girod, who also collaborated with Jacques Rouffio on the screenplay, adapted from a novel by Solange Fasquelle. He clearly is a director of talent, though not just because the film looks so good.After \\"The Conformist,\\" \\"Stavisky,\\" \\"Love and Anarchy\\" and \\"Amarcord,\\" all thirties movies are beginning to look alike, if only because of the marceled hair, the slashing red lipstick and the vintage motor cars.Mr. Girod scores his success with his actors. For the first time in years, I was convinced that Romy Schneider is an actress of wit, capable of expressing all kinds of feelings simultaneously. Mr. Piccoli may have played this sort of role before, but he has never done it with such cold, comic, vain precision. Miss Gomska, who looks enough like Miss Schneider really to be her sister, expresses a kind of vestigial decency that finally seems to be what the film is all about.That is, if the film is about anything at all, and I'm not sure it is.Because of the emphasis the director places on grotesque though not really shocking details, he seems to be inviting us to interpret the film as some kind of extravagant comment on France (or Europe) midway between two extraordinary cataclysms. These details aren't funny. Neither are they interesting enough clinically to justify their inclusion in the movie. The tone is confused rather than ambiguous in the way that would allow us to appreciate it on several levels at once.

The first-day ceremony will be held in the diplomatic room of the State Department in Washington which houses the desk on which the treaty was signed.\\n\\n For the United States and Britain, the Treaty of Paris, signed Sept. 3, 1783, formally ended the Revolutionary War. It recognized the independence of its former colonies by Great Britain. The treaty was a welcome end to the conflict the two war-weary countries had been fighting for more than eight years. It had dragged on many months after the American victory at Yorktown in 1781 which virtually assured the outcome.\\n\\n\\nThe Treaty of Paris, little known to present generations, was a triumph for the new nation and may well have provided the course for the future greatness of the United States. Of the three American peace negotiators, Benjamin Franklin, aging but acute, flinty John Adams, and John Jay, suspicious by nature, two gloried openly in what they had achieved. John Adams hailed the treaty as ''one of the most important political events that ever happened on this globe.''

About 2,000 industry executives, here at the annual convention of the American Petroleum Institute, lamented that the Senate recently voted not to consider an energy bill that would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. Worse, they said, 11 Eastern states are rushing to join California in a new system of automobile pollution control, a program that the oil companies think will mean strict gasoline specifications. And they complained about the Clean Air Act of 1990, which mandates cleaner gasoline, and about laws intended to protect underground water supplies.  'Inefficient Diversions'     Charles DiBona, the president of the institute, who has recently taken to referring to some new environmental regulations as \\"stupid,\\" said in a speech to the convention, \\"There may have been times in the past when U.S. economic supremacy allowed this country to indulge in costly, inefficient diversions, but there won't be such times in the highly competitive world that lies ahead.\\"   He added: \\"Inefficient regulation does hurt U.S. industries and working people. Plants will be driven elsewhere. Good jobs will be harder to come by.\\"   The oil companies have long complained about the cost of environmental regulations, but most complaints were muted in the period of environmental concern after the grounding of the Exxon Valdez, the mass demonstrations on Earth Day and the passage last year of amibitious amendments to the Clean Air Act. That period of reticence appears to be over.    The institute's departing chairman, Allen E. Murray, chairman of the Mobil Corporation, said he thought the public mood was changing.   \\"There is no doubt that the environment is the issue of the decade, but people are beginning to realize that there will be trade-offs,\\" he said at a news conference, citing the state of the economy. \\"I sense that we'll see a little bit of judgment. I hope it doesn't take harder economic times to do it.\\"    The institute's new chairman, C. J. Silas, chairman and chief executive of the Phillips Petroleum Company, complained of \\"the amount of money we're spending to take care of emotional problems and not physical problems.\\"    The attack on environmental initiatives was carried on by Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime Minister of Britain, who was the main speaker today. Mrs. Thatcher, who was once a research chemist, said oil company executives were as concerned as environmentalists about providing a clean environment for their children. But, she said, the country should \\"have solutions that are sound scientifically, and some of the ones proposed are not.\\"  Security Issues Fade     Another remarkable shift is the virtual end of talk about energy security, so prominent a year ago when Iraq was occupying Kuwait and the Soviet Union was still a world power.   \\"Environmental issues are replacing security issues in driving the oil industry,\\" said Thomas G. Burns, manager of economics at the corporate planning and analysis department of the Chevron Corporation.   Adding to the gloom is the industry's lackluster financial performance. A survey released by the institute today said the net income of a group of 20 oil companies had fallen 51 percent in the third quarter, to $2.2 billion, from $4.5 billion last year.    But income last year was swollen by the increase in crude oil prices after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. For the first nine months of this year, net income was $11 billion, down 16 percent from $13.1 billion a year earlier. But oil did better than the rest of the economy over the nine-month period","excerpt":"a comparison group of 100 non-oil companies saw a 50.1 percent drop in income in that period, the survey found. Low Returns     But the industry's recent financial track record is poor. Arthur L. Smith, the chairman of John S. Herrold Inc., a consulting firm that evaluates oil properties, said the rate of return for oil companies, which was running at 20 percent at the beginning of the decade, was 2 percent last year.    \\"The numbers suggest that oil companies are in business for the public good, because no economic value has been created,\\" he said.    A crucial question for oil companies is whether to invest in their refineries to produce cleaner gasoline that the Clean Air Act will require in years to come. The market for gasoline has been flat for years, and could decline if natural gas, electricity or methanol came into wide use. On the other hand, stricter environmental regulations could protect domestic refiners from competition.   \\"The international gasoline market is on the verge of a profound change,\\" said Edward N. Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis Inc., a consulting firm in Washington. The United States, with many different gasoline specifications, would turn into a \\"boutique market.\\" It is not clear how many foreign refineries that now export to this country would make the investments to be able to continue to do so, he said.

The island itself -- a Japanese colony before World War II, then controlled by the Nationalist Chinese with violent repression during the cold-war years -- has come to seem his most treasured character. \\"City of Sadness,\\" shown at the New York Film festival in 1989, tells Taiwan's story as a family saga. The poetic \\"Puppetmaster,\\" shown at the festival two years ago, layers Taiwan's history with the biography of an aged puppet maker. Now, in \\"Good Men, Good Women,\\" Mr. Hou depicts Taiwan in an even more complex way, blending history with fiction, and juxtaposing the present with recent memories. He even includes a fact-based, black-and-white movie within this elegantly shot  film. \\"Good Men, Good Women\\" will be shown as part of the New York Film Festival this afternoon at 2. It is one of the most richly imagined and also one of the most difficult films in the series.         The film is truly baffling unless you walk in knowing about the plot and characters and about the chronology that Mr. Hou shatters then asks his viewers  to reconstruct. At the center is Liang Ching, a thoroughly contemporary actress  who is receiving frightening faxes. Someone has stolen her diary, and when they  fax copies of its pages back to her, they set off memories of her lover, Ah Wei, a shady character who was murdered several years before. The contemporary scenes and recent flashbacks are shot in bright, harsh colors that suggest the lurid unhappiness of Liang Ching's life.

Newspapers in France and in Britain reported today that a senior intelligence officer in the Algerian Army was shot to death with two bodyguards and his driver on Sunday in an Algiers suburb. There was no official confirmation of the killing, but he would be the highest-ranking officer to be slain by militants since a military-backed coup set off an Islamic revolt there three years ago.   Islamic militants have also taken responsibility for blowing up three vital bridges in and around Algiers and killing at least 11 well-known figures in the arts and civil affairs in the last week. Among them were the director of the national theater","excerpt":"a composer of rai, an Arab music with a fast beat; and a leader of the feminist movement.   So far the oil industry, crucial to the country's flagging economy, has been spared. But diplomats and experts on Algerian affairs say the security situation seems to be spinning out of control, raising the prospect of an all-out guerrilla war involving big armed clashes across the country, including the capital.   European governments -- particularly that of France, which as Algeria's former colonial ruler has a large population of North Africans -- are expressing nervousness and confusion over the rapid deterioration in security. France's President, Francois Mitterrand, urged the Government this month to negotiate with the help of European mediators, but the Algerian leadership rebuffed that notion as outside interference in its affairs.   Diplomats say the ouster of Algeria's military-dominated Government could profoundly undermine the Governments of neighboring Morocco and Tunisia, leaving Europe to face a phalanx of Islamic states just across the Mediterranean modeled politically after Iran.    Europeans also fear the possibility of an influx of frightened middle-class North African migrants averse to the idea of living under Islamic rule.   Underlining those worries, Algerian militants carried out a virtually unparalleled raid on a border post in neighboring Tunisia last week, killing seven guards. The Armed Islamic Group, one of the most violent of the Algerian factions, took responsibility for that attack today.   In tracts distributed in Algiers, the group said the cross-border raid was a \\"warning\\" to Tunisia's staunchly secular Government to \\"stop helping the enemies of Islam.\\"   The violent revolt in Algeria began in early 1992, after a military-backed Government seized power and canceled a final round of elections that the Islamic movement seemed sure of winning. The new leadership banned the Islamic political movement and imposed severe limits on civil freedoms like public gatherings and writings critical of the Government.   Since then, clashes between secularists and Islamic militants have taken at least 30,000 lives, with security officers, Government officials, foreigners and, now, secular cultural figures among the main targets.   But the death toll last week, which began to surface in Algerian newspaper reports only today, represents a striking acceleration of the attacks.    French and Algerian analysts said the number killed last week exceeded 500 people, including militants, soldiers, urban civilians and Berbers in the mountainous Kabyl region in the north, where opposition to the fundamentalist campaign is strong.   The latest spate of large-scale attacks in the capital began with a suicide bombing on Jan. 30 near a police headquarters downtown that killed 42 people and wounded 256, mostly innocent civilians and pedestrians.   Often it takes several days to piece together events in Algeria. Few foreign journalists operate there because of the threat to their safety, and the Algerian Government often withholds information on rebel attacks and military operations.   The senior military officer reported killed on Sunday was Col. Mrawi Jilali, a ranking army intelligence officer responsible for issuing reports to the public and news organizations. According to several Algerian officials, he was one of the closest aides to the intelligence division's chief, Gen. Tewfik Madani, whose movements are a closely guarded secret.   The killing suggested that the fundamentalists are refining their sources of information and their infiltration of circles of the country's top leadership. Opposition figures said Colonel Jilali was under surveillance for three days before the shooting in the Kouba district, on the edge of the capital.   In December, Islamic militants took their war to France, hijacking an Air France jetliner from Algiers to Marseilles and killing three passengers before French commandos stormed the plane and killed the hijackers.    For the French Government, the most alarming aspect of the hijacking may be that intelligence officials now suspect that Iran helped instigate it .   In an article this week in the French weekly Paris Match, a former journalist and novelist, Gerard de Villiers, reports that French intelligence officials are saying that Iran has linked up with Islamic militants in Algeria \\"on an operational level,\\" lending advice and support.   Mr. de Villiers quotes French anti-terrorist intelligence officials as saying that early in December, weeks before the Christmas Eve hijacking began, Iran's minister of secret and intelligence services, Ali Fallahian, met with representatives of the Islamic Armed Group, the Palestinian organization Hamas and the Iranian-backed militia in Lebanon known as the Party of God. All three groups are militantly Islamic in their orientation and receive advice and financial backing from Iran.   Mr. de Villiers wrote that French intelligence agents were tipped off about the meeting, which took place in Tripoli, Lebanon, by Syrian counterparts who watch Lebanon carefully.    Until recently, French intelligence believed that Algerian militants received some training in Iran and in the Sudan and some financial support. But the meeting in Lebanon appears to have taken relations to a higher level.   Last month, France's confusion over what to do about Algeria was evident. President Mitterrand's call for talks between militants and the army to end the conflict broke with a French policy of supporting the Algerian Government in its effort to eradicate militants. Mr. Mitterrand was immediately contradicted by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who said the war was an internal Algerian affair.   Nonetheless, the attacks on vital targets in Algiers have shaken confidence among French officials that the Algerian military can still control the situation in the country of 30 million, where unemployment runs close to 40 percent. The economic misery helps the militants' drive to recruit volunteers to overthrow the Government.   Among the three vital bridges blown up in and around the capital in the last two days was one linking a neighborhood where the army headquarters and main armed forces hospital are located.   Any lingering hopes that the Government might renew a bid for negotiations with jailed leaders of the Islamic opposition have faded somewhat with reports in a London-based daily that the movement's leader, Abassi Madani, who was moved from house arrest to a military jail this month, has undergone an operation to remove a serious cancerous growth from his gums or jaw. The Algerian Government has not confirmed the report, which appeared in the Arabic-language paper Asharq Al Awsat.   Mr. Madani was moved from house arrest to a military jail earlier this month. It is not clear under what conditions he has been held following the surgery.

A strategy in planning the current year's festivities was to inaugurate projects and expansions that would be continued in future years, but on a smaller scale. Carnegie Hall is trying to keep its promises, while at the same time making the reductions either significant or else deferring the new projects until 1992-93 and beyond. There were 14 new commissions for the centennial season, but there will be only one next year: a song cycle by Andre Previn written for Kathleen Battle with texts by Toni Morrison, to be performed by Ms. Battle and the Orchestra of St. Luke's conducted by the composer.   Robert Shaw will repeat his choral workshop next year, culminating in a performance of the Beethoven Missa Solemnis. Pierre Boulez will not repeat his contemporary music workshop next season because of scheduling problems, but Judith Arron, executive director of the hall, said that Mr. Boulez had expressed interest in returning the season after next. The opera-in-concert project will continue with Tchaikovsky's \\"Pique Dame,\\" performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra led by Mr Ozawa, with Mirella Freni, Vladimir Atlantov and Maureen Forrester as soloists.

To the faithful, Ms. Simone's visits are not just concerts but ceremonial reunions at which \\"the high priestess of soul\\" returns from a self-imposed exile to bless her flock and to refresh her own sense of self-worth. During one especially boisterous round of acclaim at the Beacon, she stoked the applause by gesturing for more and demanding: \\"Feed me!  Feed me! I need it!\\"    The ceremony would be ludicrous were Ms. Simone not an astonishingly dramatic performer. When she feels comfortable and appreciated, as she did at the Beacon, she can take a familiar song and virtually reinvent it, sometimes by interpolating her own lyrics, to turn it into an intense, often troubling personal journey. The drama comes from the volatile mix of Ms. Simone's deep, rumbling voice, her elegant classical pianism and her mercurial temperament. A brooding ballad can suddenly explode with anger. An exultant cry of delight can just as suddenly crack with pain. Review/Pop","excerpt":"A Concert Like a Reunion"},{"year":"1986","title":"FLUTE recitals sometimes suffer from a lack of variety.

Herbert Brenon has done valiant work in his pictorial transcription of \\"The Rescue,\\" which is now on exhibition at the Rialto Theatre. He has skillfully preserved the essence of the narrative, and while he has been obliged to make certain concessions for the benefit of populer approval, sometimes in the facial appearances of the characters and in other cases in their costumes, most of the episodes are vitalized by more than a more suggestion of the masterful writer.Even though Ronald Colman may not answer Conrad's description of Tom Lingard, his performance is so earnest and sensitive that in spite of his coal-black hair, his clean-shaven chin and small mustache he is not only far from disappointing but he reflects the spirit of \\"King\\" Tom. The most exacting of Conrad enthusiasts will find in this picture quite a number of inspiring passages that are filmed with a high degree of artistic taste. There is the first flash at night of the barely perceptible becalmed brig, which is followed by an imaginative conception of oars pulling a boat in the dark. There is a spaciousness about all the scenes, especially those showing a lazy sea caressing the beach.Mr. Brenon sustains the interest throughout his many scenes and he clings to Conrad's closing incidents, even to \\"King\\" Tom's final command to \\"Steer north.\\"Besides many native outrigger craft, there are three large vessels used in this picture: Tom Lingard's brig Lightning, the yacht Hermit and a derelict tramp steamship, which is blown up. This explosion is most effectively filmed, for after old Jorgensen puts a fuse to the powder magazine, black spars and bits of the old ship are beheld through the smoke, flying in the air.Mr. Brenon has a keen sense of ships, for when Lingard and others are seen aboard the Hermit one never confuses scenes on this craft with those aboard the brig and those in the tramp.Although Lily Damita, the French actress who plays the part of Mrs. Edith Travers, is much too elaborately dressed, she is fascinatingly handsome and gives an intelligent performance of the difficult rôle allotted to her. Mr. Brenon might have insisted upon lèss make-up on her eyées, as it hardly seems natural for even such a character to spend so much time on her appearance in view of the somewhat disturbing events.This tale of the Java waters tells of the yacht Hermit, owned by Mr. Travers, going aground at a spot where the natives think only of slaughtering white people. Travers is a stubborn old member of Parliament who resents his wife's admiration for Tom Lingard, captain of the Lightning.There are fights between natives, gun-running and a variety of exploits, including scenes where Travers and his friend de'Alcacer are saved from death at the hands of the natives by Lingard, known to the dusky men as \\"King\\" Tom. Lingard and Edith Travers have a mad love affair, which ends with their going their different ways.The scenes in the native stockade are stirringly filmed. Seldom throughout this production is one in the least conscious that the people are performing in front of a camera. The different native rôles are especially well portrayed. The reliable Sojin is excellent as the malignant Daman, and Harry Cording is splendid as Belarab. Theodore von Eltz does well as Carter and Bernard Siegel is sympathetic as th sacrificing Jorgensen.On the same program is \\"Boyhood Days.\\" a Paramount sound film, which is about as annoying as any noisy edition of pictorial work that has so far been presented.

He paces around the stage, slipping easily and impressively in and out of many voices, accents, walks and faces.

They do get the chance to step back in time to the English Cotswolds of the 19th century and discover an elegantly simple, genteel way of life in a bucolic setting.   \\"The experience here is different from the experience in a lot of other state parks,\\" said Michael Gundersen, the supervisor at Topsmead (the name means \\"top of the meadow\\") since it opened to the public. Miss Chase \\"wanted people to enjoy it much the same way she did,\\" he said. \\"People can come up here, spread a blanket, have privacy and feel like the place is theirs.\\"    The first clue to Topsmead's special quality is the crest on its entrance sign. \\"One of the things I think the State of Connecticut Parks System is very good about is recognizing the individuality of the different facilities,\\" Mr. Gundersen said. \\"They don't come out and say, This is our standard park sign.\\"   Visitors can see how Miss Chase and her two companions, Lucy and Mary Burrell, lived. On the second and fourth weekends of each month from June through October the house is open for tours from noon to 5 P.M. No more than 10 people are allowed in the house at once. The grounds are open daily from 8 A.M. to sunset.   The cottage, a version of an English Tudor-style house typical of the Cotswolds, was built in 1925 on a 16-acre tract originally given to Miss Chase by her father, who was president of Chase Brass Company in Waterbury, where Miss Chase grew up and later spent her winters. Over the years her investments and shrewd business sense enabled her to acquire surrounding farms and six houses.  Crops for Wild Turkeys    \\"Four acres around the house are maintained as a formal area,\\" said Mr. Gundersen, seated in Topsmead's living room. \\"Quite a large number of fields are leased to local farmers. The rest -- about 20 percent to 30 percent -- are fields that are cut for hay. The farmers in exchange also plant some areas of wildlife plots -- crops planted for wild turkeys, a lot of grouse, deer, partridges. We also have some coyotes, fox and snowshoe hare. It's mostly woodland and fields here.\\"    In 1917 Miss Chase built a rustic cabin on her first 16 acres. The current house grew around the cabin, Mr. Gundersen explained. \\"She was adamant about keeping the fireplace and cabin intact,\\" he said, so her architect, Richard Henry Dana Jr., incorporated the first building into the plan for the Cotswold cottage.    \\"The exterior is stucco and brick, and the wood is cypress,\\" Mr. Gundersen said. \\"They used it because it's extremely rot-resistant. It's not painted and is naturally weathered. The glass is all leaded, the roof is local slate, and the beams are oak.\\"   The furnishings are simple but tasteful, he said, purchased on Miss Chase's trips to England and New York. \\"Her goal was to put as many pieces of antique furniture in the house as possible,\\" he said. \\"Most of it is 17th-, 18th- and some 19th-century English furniture, made of oak, apple-grain oak, elm and holly.\\"   Pointing to a corner of the living room, Mr. Gundersen said: \\"The oldest piece of furniture is that bench over there, dating to 1419, carved with church figures. And over here we have a couple of 17th-century church seats, heavily carved. This table is early 18th century, a gateleg, drop leaf table with a stretcher base. She also had the guest beds and other furniture made to match the house.\\"    Bookshelves in the chintz-decorated living room hold 1,500 volumes reflecting their owner's frequent travels to Europe, the Far East, Egypt and Russia. Mr. Gundersen said he planned to catalogue the books this winter.    In the dining room the tour guides are often asked where the fine china is, Mr. Gundersen said. \\"Even though it's a simple mustard yellow, this china is Wedgwood,\\" he said, turning a plate over.   Simple, antique hand-hooked rugs are scattered throughout the house. Through the dining-room window one can see the dovecote, detached from the main house and added several years later, a two-story, pencil-thin building that served as a gardening shed and guest room. Mr. Gundersen said Miss Chase's married guests and male relatives stayed there.    In the last few months Topsmead has been busier than usual. \\"We've had to close the gates because the parking lot is at its capacity of 40 cars,\\" he said. \\"I don't like to have to do that, but a lot of parks do the same thing. On open weekends lately it averages 80 to 100 people per day. That's comfortable.   \\"One of the things about Topsmead is that Miss Chase wanted things to be simple: the gardens, the orchard, the furniture, the china. But when you put the whole thing together, it's outstanding.\\" TOPSMEAD STATE FOREST","excerpt":"A Cottage Transports Visitors to the 19th-Century Cotswolds"},{"year":"1986","title":"Like countless other New Yorkers, a friend of ours has been living in a climate that mimics spring.

But neither has to be a chore if done properly and systematically.   The point to remember in pulling together a weekend wardrobe is that getting the most out of the least is the key.  To accomplish this, coordination is all important.  One should stay with basic colors - such as tan, khaki and white - for trousers, and add two or three patterned shirts that can be worn with any of the trousers.

As the number of admirers and collectors of the furniture has grown, so has the acumen of its owners. Country folk - if there are still any left - no longer sell the family's comfortably worn heirlooms to the first person who comes along with a truck and a $5 bill.

It is spending the week at the Strand Theatre.Life in the cold, Far North seems to be pretty much a matter of repetition without variation. There is always the transplanted woman, not hardened to primitive roughness, and by her plight and pulchritude a disturbing element in the barren existence of sturdy men, setting the wicked ones on fire to destroy her, and inspiring the heroes to assert the high nobility of their natures. In the end, always, one of the heroes comes south, where civilization is, to marry the girl, which is a wise and logical step on his part, for, no matter how tame married life in the centre of law and order may be, it is preferable on many counts to the monotony of having to defend or rescue a woman three times a day, before or after meals, from stupid poors, who never learn how to treat a lady.\\"Isobel, or the Trail's End,\\" runs true to form, or formula, deviating only to be originally illogical, as when two indefatigable and presumably intelligent man-hunters of the Northwest Mounted Police spend a year or more in the frozen North looking for an alleged murderer without retaining the name of the murdered man. Also the photoplay is needlessly wordy, and, hoping no doubt to be suspensive, it has adopted the annoying practice of deliberately withholding information from time to time.But, when all this is said, there remains something positive in favor of these melodramas of the north compared to their brothers of further south. Their setting is naturally a subject for motion pictures, and has not been done so much as the scenery of California, Arizona and New Mexico. Snow and ice photograph well, and in the hands of a competent cameraman they offer exceptional opportunities for pictures, with the sting of the wind and the majesty of endless space in them. And when the actors in a story of the far north play their parts reasonably well, the hackneyed plots they follow take on something of vigor and reality, although, of course, they can not come out of their north, like their heroes, and stand alone.So it is by its scenery, its snow expanses, its blizzards, its biting nights, its Esquimaux villages, its dog teams streaking the white world with black, that \\"Isobel\\" catches the imagination. Apparently its director, Edwin Carewe, and his company were not afraid to go where snow and ice really were, and whoever commanded the camera took more than nature voluntarily offered. Photographic artistry entered into the making of many of the scenes. Also the cast, headed by House Peters, Jane Novak and Edward Peil, make the automatons they impersonate as lifelike as the story permits. As the photoplay never worries itself about being consistent, colored pictures incongruously introduced every once in a while among the black-and-whites are not disturbing, as they would be in an otherwise logical narrative, and, being well done, are pleasing.The photoplay is preceded by an excellent Prisma work entitled \\"Way Up Yonder,\\" which seems to be an assemblage of some of the pictures brought from Alaska by Dr. Leonard S. Sudgeon a year or more ago.\\"To Please One Woman\\" is the title by which the photoplay at the Rivoli this week gives itself away. To please the woman in question, her husband futilely robs a bank or something and then achieves his ambition by committing suicide","excerpt":"a country doctor of apparent impeccability falls out with his sweetheart because of the woman, and after that recklessly eats lunch with her every day; a silly girl sees her smoking and immediately borrows a dime from her swain to buy a box of cigarettes, and this young rustic, not having the dime, steals it from his employer's cash drawer, thus starting on a life of crime, from the consequences of which he is saved only by the pettiness of his pilfering. Incidentally, this character, played by George Hackathorne, can claim youthfulness only on the ground that a man is as old as he feels, but in doing so he would be ungallant to Edith Kessler in the rôle opposite him, for he would force the conclusion that a woman is as old as she looks.The picture might be subtitled \\"In imitation of Griffith.\\" Mr. Griffith can take such trite, homiletic stories of small-town virtue and corrupting vampires and by the magic of cinematography sometimes give them life, but Lois Weber, who wrote and directed \\"To Please One Woman,\\" evidently has not his talent or knack. Occasionally her picture shows flashes of inspiration, which may be evidence that with more responsive material she could make a sufficient number of dramatic moving pictures to compose an exceptional photoplay, and this seems the more likely because of similar evidence in some of her earlier works. So, perhaps, the production that fulfills the promises made for each of Miss Weber's pictures is to come.Claire Windsor is the heroine of the present piece, and heads the cast in fact as well as name; Mona Lisa, as she calls herself, is the vampire, and has a number of good scenes, but by overacting deprives others of any trace of the mystery commonly associated with the well-known portrait. Edward Burns is the country doctor.Though Miss Weber assumes responsibility for writing and directing the production, she says that she got the \\"story idea\\" from Marion Orth. Is this a generic name for the legion who have entertained it?\\"Oh, Lady, Lady,\\" an adaptation of the musical comedy of that name, with Bebe Daniels in the leading rôle, is at the Rialto this week, and \\"Passion,\\" with Pola Negri, has won a second week for itself at the Capitol.\\"Ireland\\" was the subject of E.

There were airs from \\"Martha\\" for Mario Chamlee, from \\"Pearl of Brazil\\" for Mabel Garrison and from \\"The Prophet\\" for Jeanne Gordon.

It's also the story of a very saintly man; and certainly such stories are rare these days. That said, \\"Tent of Miracles\\" is also too messy and jumbled to have many other selling points.The subject of the film is Pedro Archanjo, a black Bahian sociologist who is also supposed to have been a brilliant philosopher, his principal theory being that miscegenation is necessary and healthy for Brazilian society. Unfortunately, his story is told and discussed by a bunch of hip young film makers, supposedly at work on a biographical movie, who aren't properly equipped to explain his genius. Their story, which takes up almost as much time as the movie-within-a-movie about Archanjo, is uninteresting and at times almost unintelligible.Archanjo turns out to have been a man who enthusiastically practiced what he preached. In the film's best sequences, he appears as a young man, involved with women of all shades and persuasions and merrily outraging the supposedly white upper classes. One of Archanjo's theories is that everyone in Bahia is of mixed blood anyway, and one of his supposedly most daring acts is to publish a booklet naming black ancestors of all the fanciest white families.Nelson Pereira dos Santos is a well-established Brazilian director, but the film is surprisingly clumsy, almost amateurish at times: for instance, it is at first difficult to tell whether the footage of Archanjo's story is meant to be a series of flashbacks or excerpts from the film being made. A white American scientist, who yells things such as \\"May I have my money?\\" at the top of his lungs, is supposed to be a Nobel Laureate but looks more like a freshman quarterback.

Now that our kids are getting near college age, I really need to get the money they're owed. Any suggestions?\\nA. Chasing down an ex-spouse for child support payments is no one's idea of a good time. Even when substantial arrears accumulate, many custodial parents find every excuse to let the matter slide. \\"At least I'm getting something from my 'ex,' \\" goes one common line of reasoning. \\"If I make him angry, he'll cut me off altogether.\\"\\n\\nSome people figure that the road to collection is so long and bumpy that they'll spend a fortune and wind up with nothing to show for it. Others know they should go after what is rightfully theirs, but they keep putting it off, just as they keep putting off writing a will or cleaning behind the stove. \\n\\nIn the United States, deadbeat dads and a small group of moms owe $34 billion to 17 million children.\\n\\nMake no mistake: in some situations, collecting child support can be a headache of biblical proportions. After a divorce in 1990, Jeffrey A. Nichols, an investment adviser, fled the country to avoid paying $8,000 a month in child support. The strategy worked for a while. By moving from New York to Canada to Florida to Vermont, Mr. Nichols managed to stay a step ahead of local court orders for five years until he was arrested this month, with $500,000 in arrears. Mr. Nichols is the first man to be charged in New York City under the 1992 Child Support Recovery Act, which makes it a Federal crime to avoid paying child support by fleeing to another state. The debt is the largest the Government has ever sought to recover under the law.\\n\\nCollecting back payments isn't always so hard for former spouses. If the absent parent is employed and easy to track down, the first step is to file a petition with family court for a wage withholding order. In most states, you don't need a lawyer to complete and file the forms","excerpt":"a court clerk can tell you if a lawyer is necessary. Once the process is complete, the court will direct your ex-spouse's employer to deduct the applicable amount from his paycheck and forward it to the court for payment to you. Income from unemployment benefits, pension funds and other sources is also attachable.\\n\\nIf your ex-spouse is unemployed or self-employed and skilled at hiding his income, you might consider seeking a money judgment against him and attaching his assets. Your local office of child support, which is mandated by Federal law to help custodial parents collect any payments due them, can begin the process for you. (The national Office of Child Support Enforcement can be reached at 202 401-9370.)\\n\\nIn \\"How to Collect Your Child Support\\" (Adams Publishing, 1995, $7.95), Julieanne Griffin warns that \\"most states have such a backlog of cases as to make this procedure impractical, too expensive and too slow.\\" In Texas, for example, the state has managed to collect in fewer than a fifth of the 800,000-plus outstanding cases. The moral: if you're looking to get your hands on your ex's bank account, investments or trust fund, it probably pays to hire a lawyer. This can be costly, Ms. Griffin warns, \\"so you may want to make sure the account you want to garnish has enough money to offset the costs of the action.\\"\\n\\nIf your former spouse buys or sells a house, you can place a lien on the proceeds from the sale. Again, the office of child support is empowered to help you, though many states now have lien laws that kick in automatically. Ms. Griffin, a single mother of two, said she was already having trouble making ends meet when her ex-husband lost his job and stopped paying child support. He eventually found work and resumed his payments, but a substantial delinquency remained. When he decided to buy a house, the real estate agent asked Ms. Griffin to release the lien for unpaid child support. \\"I refused,\\" she writes, \\"and I got the money.\\" \\n\\nYou can also help yourself to any Federal income tax refund intended for your former spouse. The beauty of this option is that his employment status and whereabouts are irrelevant: all you need to know is his Social Security number. Again, your local office of child support can help you file the necessary papers.\\n\\nIf all else fails, you may want to look at one of the 150 or so child-support collection agencies that charge a bounty for tracking deadbeat parents and getting them to pay. These agencies, which are relatively new, combine encyclopedic knowledge of applicable laws with the zeal of Inspector Javert.

Perhaps the most significant lesson I have learned is this: a court of law is not the proper place for deciding matters of historical significance or indeed judging the motives of those who played important roles in history.  However, as my case and several others have recently demonstrated, this country and its citizens, public and private alike, need some nongovernmental, nonjudicial forum where complaints against the media can be heard, judged and redressed.  This is not an indictment of our legal system. All who participated in my case, including the defendants and their counsel, conducted themselves in a proper manner. But one cannot recreate a major historical event in the courtroom.  As for the CBS Reports television program ''The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception,'' I know that it was biased, misleading - far from objective. But that sometimes occurs in journalism, which properly seeks to expose misdeeds, bad judgments, acts against the public interest.

Born in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Dr. Goudsmit earned his M.D, there in 1931. In 1933 he and his wife Hellen came to the US, where each earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry at Cornell Medical College (1936). His training in Internal Medicine was at the Mayo Clinic. Beginning in 1939 he was Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania; and during WWII he was a medical officer on Iwo Jima with the Army Air Corps. He practiced medicine in Youngstown, OH, taught at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School, and served as the first president of the Ohio chapter of the American Society of Internal Medicine. His vision and leadership led to the founding of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 1964 (for which he was honored last June). In the late '60's he left private practice to assume a role as Oncologist at the Dearborn VA Hospital. Later he became Chief of Surgical Oncology at the Minneapolis VA Hospital. At age 70, Noldus enrolled in Divinity School. For a time he was Associate Minister at the First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis. He then combined his love of medicine and theology by becoming a hospital chaplain. He was a wonderful pianist, an avid hiker, an active cyclist and cross-country skier. After he moved to Rochester, NY, in 1998, he continued to attend numerous medical meetings and traveled extensively. He enriched our lives with his wisdom, kindness and vitality, as well as his warmth and optimism. We are grateful for his example of a life well lived.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is saddened by the loss of Arnoldus Goudsmit, MD, PhD. Dr. Goudsmit was one of the leaders in the development of the discipline of clinical oncology, and one of the seven founding members of ASCO forty-one years ago. His vision for the Society is today the world's leading authority in the education and training of oncologists with 24,000 members worldwide. Dr. Goudsmit's leadership of clinical oncology, which now represents all cancer specialties, has contributed greatly to the improved diagnosis, treatment, well-being and longevity of hundreds of thousands of individuals with cancer. Dr. Goudsmit's family has established a fund at The ASCO Foundation to recognize his many contributions to the field of oncology. For more information, please call 1-703-519-1456.

Workers are trained more intensively. Facilities are inspected more rigorously.

The Russians' worthy film version of Gogol's \\"The Inspector General\\" gave way on Saturday at the Stanley to still another and even better play transcription, Gorky's \\"The Mistress.\\"Produced in suitably low-keyed Sovcolor at the Maxim Gorky Film Studio (no less) of Moscow, and flawlessly performed by members of the State Maly Theatre, this is a really nice job of uprooting a vintage vehicle snugly designed for footlight limitations. And under a particularly subtle and camera-conscious director, one L. Lukov, this Artkino release flows in easy, natural fashion.From the outset, the Gorky novitiate is aware of two things. The playwright (or scenarist, as no adaptation credit is listed) has used a highly specialized household for some sociological handwriting on the wall. And, the characters themselves make up the most distasteful family circle since Lillian Hellman's \\"The Little Foxes,\\" to which this forerunner bears a striking resemblance throughout.Gorky was concerned with the decadent decline of a bureaucratic White Russian clan, shipping rulers of a small port who are ruled, one and all, by the mother. Like the Hellman heroine, she deliberately promoted her husband's death, tightening an iron vise on the others. These include a lecherous brother, who drives a seduced servant to suicide, casually turning one of his nieces into a sullen alcoholic","excerpt":"a crafty housekeeper, and another, slightly imbecilic daughter who succumbs to a gardener (and rake combined).Are these specimens repulsive,?

And, typically, her showdown with the matriarch, the real climax, emerges with skillful credibility and balanced compassion, as Gorky undoubtedly intended.The hard fact remains that this film is all conversation. Most of it, excepting some fluently injected exteriors, occurs in one room of a significantly spacious home.

When the arrearages on interest are added, however, the country now owes about $47 billion.   Since Argentina has been unable to finance the bulk of its debts long-term, it has borrowed heavily from the banks in short- and medium-term loans, and a huge sum - about $20 billion - comes due this year. In addition, Argentina will be obligated to pay about $5 billion in interest charges this year. And its total arrearages on interest now due to foreign banks come to about $2.7 billion.

Their devious capers include imbibing freely of cocktails on Florida sands, dashing in a speed, boat to Rum Row to replenish their empty liquor lockers and throwing eggs from the window of a New York Park Avenue apartment at passersby. This particular group has no hesitancy in declaring their parents to be no saintly examples of humanity.In this offering, which has been for the most part ably directed by John Blystone, Thomas Meighan returns to the screen after an absence of two years. He impersonates Tom McGuire, a forceful physical trainer, whose severe but understanding methods have a salutary effect upon a gilded youth named Gene Gibson. The young man in turn succeeds in setting a good example to the incorrigible Constance Sinclair. Hence McGuire is to be congratulated on having curbed the effervescent spirits of at least two of the boisterous clan.Mr. Meighan gives an excellent performance, so good in fact that the scenes in which he appears are far and away the most interesting of this finely photographed production. It is a part thoroughly well suited to Mr. Meighan, and his acting is really more convincing than it had been in his previous portrayals, chiefly because he is not the romantic hero, but a stalwart character who in the end is humbled by Gibson.Most of Mr. Meighan's sequences take place in the Adirondacks, and through the sight of the snow and the suggestion of cold one is impressed with the effect the chopping down of trees, long tramps over the snow on skis and other exercise might have upon a young man of Gibson's type. When he sits down to eat he really looks hungry. It is McGuire's contention that a healthy body means a healthy mind. It is no easy task to regenerate Gibson, who one day is caught by McGuire about to sneak a drink of whisky. For this failure to stick to the curriculum McGuire administers a beating to Gibson, and then—McGuire being a good-natured man at heart—he gives the bottle to Gibson, saying that the young man deserves a drink. The high-spirited Gibson throws the bottle at the trainer, who catches it and cooly replaces it on the mantel.By the time Constance discovers where Gene is in hiding he appreciates the benefits of the simple life, Gibson's conduct toward this attractive girl surprises her, considering that they are alone in the McGuire cottage for the night. Constance's mother hopes to have her daughter married to a German Baron, but, as one might suppose, there is no thought of that after the girl observes the decided improvement in Gibson's health and demeanor.This picture moves fast, but occasionally it seems as though a few important points remain unexplained. Constance, for instance, turns up abruptly at the secluded Adirondack camp, but how she reaches there and what becomes of her sleigh are left to the spectator's imagination. Then, too, one has the feeling that in spite of McGuire's watchfulness Gibson might have found some way during the night to get away from the place. Then some of the scenes with Gibson and Constance in the trainer's cabin are prolonged to a point when they become rather tedious. Be that as it may, however, this \\"Young Sinners\\" makes for a highly satisfactory entertainment.Hardie Albright gives a worthy account of himself as Gibson. Dorothy Jordan is attractive, but frequently she speaks her lines too fast. Cecilia Loftus does well as Constance's mother. James Kirkwood makes the most of the part of Gibson's father. Edmund Breese, Lucien Prival and Nora Lane also help this film by their work. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A Cure for Gilded Youth.

Some three miles from Savile Row, for example, Ray Thorn has for 18 years been wielding his shears in Beauchamp Place (pronounced BEECH-um), a short block of trendy and tacky stores just around the corner from Harrods. There, at No. 14, in somewhat cramped firstfloor quarters packed with sample books and racks of clothes in progress, Mr. Thorn turns out some 750 outfits a year for Londoners and visitors - like other bespoke tailors, he is happy to serve those with only a few days in London - mostly suits but trousers and jackets as well.

Market Place","excerpt":"A cut in deposit insurance rates may be a boon for bank stocks."},{"year":"1992","title":"The problem for President Bush's budget planners this year was how to meet his election-year political needs without seeming to ignore the enormous Federal deficit.   They resolved the problem in the tried and true method inaugurated by Ronald Reagan when deficits first began to mushroom, and employed annually in the last few years by Mr. Bush and his budget director, Richard G. Darman.    It involves proposing, with considerable fanfare, popular tax and spending measures and offsetting their cost on the balance sheet with accounting gimmicks and putative spending reductions that might be good policy but that the President has no intention of going to the mat for.   That lets him take credit for measures the voters like and blame Congress for the rising deficit.     This year, the President plans to propose a tax reduction of a few hundred dollars a year for the middle class, a tax credit of a few thousand dollars for first-time home buyers, tax writeoffs for medical insurance premiums, new depreciation rules to make investments in plants and machinery more attractive, tax breaks for the real estate industry that were scrapped six years ago and a little more money for Head Start, one of the few programs Democrats and Republicans alike favor.   These proposals were written to appeal to particular voters or contributors like middle-class taxpayers, manufacturers, builders, realtors and investors. But they would cost money. So how would he pay for them?In part, with some proposals that would make some voters tighten their belts:   *Deep cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals, stiff increases in the premiums affluent elderly people are charged for Medicare insurance against doctors' bills and the imposition of the Medicare payroll tax on state and local government workers.   *The abolition of some entrenched Government programs like operating subsidies for mass transit and education grants to communities with military bases.   Do not expect to hear much about these items after the budget is made public Jan. 29. They have all been offered before and were rejected by Congress out of hand. Mr. Bush has never expended an ounce of energy on their behalf.   The budget will also show increased revenue from proposals that cause little if any pain to anyone: a modest reduction in military spending","excerpt":"a cut in the capital gains tax that the Administration calculates would actually raise revenue; a new kind of savings account that would raise a few billion in additional revenue for the Government at first but cost billions more years down the road; bookkeeping changes in the way deposit insurance and pension guarantees are accounted for.    These Mr. Bush will talk about on in his campaign.     Unlike government budgets in parliamentary democracies, Presidents' budgets are not blueprints for the policies to be followed. Here, Congress controls the purse strings. The President can use his veto power to prevent the lawmakers from moving in directions he opposes. But he can win acceptance of his own proposals only if he throws his weight around, and on his most controversial budget items, he has rarely done so.   If he had given the same kind of attention last year to persuading Congress to limit benefit payments to the affluent that he devoted, say, to blocking civil rights legislation or to winning confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, he might have carried the day and cut the deficit by billions of dollars.   As the election year wears on, Mr. Bush will doubtless try to get off the hook with voters concerned about high taxes, bad schools and unaffordable medical insurance by pointing to his budget proposals and blaming Congress for inaction.   But the Democratic Presidential candidates can hardly complain. They are free to make outlandish proposals. And they do not have to present the other side of the ledger.

A Dadaist improviser with a streak of the mystic in him, Mr. Frith, like that granddaddy of avant-gardists John Cage, finds music in everything that clanks, squeaks, rattles and hisses. He can turn just about anything lying around the house into a musical instrument. And in one sequence, he and some friends give an impromptu backyard performance of bossa nova music using rhythm instruments made of empty bottles and other household debris.    The guitarist's indomitable curiosity and playfulness inspirit the documentary by the Swiss film makers Nicolas Humber and Werner Penzel with a cheeky energy. And in their musical portrait of Mr. Frith, which opened today at Film Forum, they carry his open-ended esthetic to movie making. The result might be described as a kind of Dadaist symphony of sound and image.

Fortunately, they will be disappointed. There is no sign here of the Dali of  the last half-century (he died in 1989), when he so assiduously cultivated notoriety and fortune that his erstwhile Surrealist colleague Andre Breton famously rearranged the letters of his name to become Avida Dollars. Nor is this a show about the Dali whose work, increasingly a recycling of his youthful ideas, became more and more a matter of merchandising. And neither is it about the aging prankster who was said to have signed thousands of blank sheets of paper, later turned into factory-produced lithographs, that flooded the market and fueled the bitterness surrounding his already plummeting reputation.

The premiere on the program, which marked the New York debut of Dalton-Hartel Dance, was typical. \\"The Second Circle,\\" conceived by the two dancers and Kaulana Kasparovitch, a performer of traditional Hawaiian dance and music, takes as its inspiration two lines from Dante's \\"Inferno.\\" Unfolding in a dark, tightly circumscribed stage space, the new work had Ms. Dalton and Mr. Hartel twisting up from the floor and straining toward each other, curling into their own and each other's bodies claustrophobically. The duet powerfully communicated the feeling of circling and turning in a confined space and, at the same time, crawling across chasms.

One of the earliest and headiest moments in the rebellion was the ascendancy of the twist in 1960. Five years after Elvis Presley scandalized the guardians of public decency with his televised gyrations, the biggest dance craze since the Charleston liberated social dancing from genteel ballroom conventions and made everybody an Elvis imitator.   As Ron Mann's entertaining documentary \\"Twist,\\" which opens today at the Village East Cinemas, reconstructs the craze, it came in several phases. Early in 1960, Hank Ballard and the Midnighters scored a sizable hit with \\"The Twist,\\" a record that had been the B-side of a minor hit he had released the previous year. Chubby Checker, a vocal impressionist from Philadelphia, quickly recorded an imitation of Mr. Ballard's record that was so close to the original in sound that even Mr. Ballard thought it was his own version the first time he heard it on the radio.

For this sombre combination of blighted romance and cloak-and-dagger derring-do about the efforts to sabotage a strategic war plant is unable to settle down in any one direction. The result is a rather disjointed adventure, not particularly distinguished or different in concept from the many minor variations of this theme which have been coming from the continent since the end of the conflict.Played on two levels, \\"The Invisible Army\\" is concerned with the affair between the wife of an underground leader and the latter's best friend. The lady, it appears, really is in love with her husband but years of separation by war and loneliness have driven her into the arms of a sympathetic vis-a-vis. Of course, the major portion of the script is devoted to the \\"Army's\\" planning and destruction of the Metroban, a manufactory turning out tank treads, machine guns and one-man submarines. While love involves much soul-searching in this case, it must be noted that it does much to slow down and detract from the producers' attempt to build up a suspenseful and explosive climax.Mogens Wieth is handsome and competent as the husband, who forgives his errant wife before he meets a tragic end at the hands of the Gestapo. Ebbe Rode is stiff as the \\"mental collaborator,\\" an esthetic architect who loves that lady and ultimately gives his life so that the mission is accomplished successfully. As the wife who is torn between two amours, Bodil Kjaer, a trim and beautiful blonde, succeeds only in appearing doleful.

Age 62, died peacefully in his sleep at his home in Sarasota, FL, on Sunday, August 22, 2004, after a long battle with cancer. Mr. Berkowitz, as President of one of the nation's first and largest retail Money Market Mutual Funds, Dreyfus Liquid Assets, helped to transform the way Americans save. As he told ''Forbes'' in 1980, ''...the savings public is becoming more sophisticated. It will not stand for this 5% rate on passbooks (savings accounts).'' He fought against the regulation of the money market industry and welcomed competition from banks by testifying in favor of lifting Regulation Q--which prevented banks from paying prevailing high interest rates on savings accounts. In 1964 a twenty-three year old William ''Bill'' Berkowitz came to work at The Dreyfus Corporation, the New York based investment management firm. By 1974 Bill Berkowitz had become an officer of The Dreyfus Corporation, and soon thereafter he created and became President of Dreyfus Liquid Assets, one of the first retail oriented Money Market Mutual Funds. Dreyfus' money market services and assets grew to a top industry position under his leadership. By 1981 most of Dreyfus' $12.4 billion of assets under management was in short-term money in over 300,000 accounts. Bill became President of the Reich & Tang, L.P. Mutual Funds Group and Executive Vice President and Director of Reich & Tang L.P. in 1982. The Mutual Funds Group grew rapidly under his leadership until 1994 when Reich & Tang, L.P. merged with the asset management division of the New England Companies, creating one of the largest investment management companies in the world. He was also a VicePresident and Board member of various third party mutual funds like Gabelli Asset Growth, Equitable Life's money market mutual funds and Speers, Benzak, Solomon and Farrell Funds. He was born September 20, 1941, in Bronx, NY. Before receiving his Bachelor of Science in Finance from New York University in 1963, he attended Syracuse University and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan in 1959. He lived in Middletown, NJ, and commuted to New York City for 16 years before moving to Sarasota, FL, in 1982. He retired from Reich and Tang, L.P. in 1994. Through the William and Dale S. Berkowitz Family Foundation and through invididual efforts, Bill supported the Flanzer Jewish Community Center of Sarasota, FL, and its Maccabi Games. He also supported the Florida Studio Theatre and the Sarasota YMCA Foundation. Bill was an avid art collector and a patron of a number of local Sarasota artists.

His \\"In Search of Self\\" (1952) was based on some 3,000 interviews with students from the fourth grade to college. He found that even small children have more self-awareness than was commonly thought and that emotional hurt can leave emotional scars worse than the scars from a physical attack.   \\"The little child knows what it is to have his feelings hurt,\\" he wrote, \\"to be sad, to be disappointed with as much the same basic meaning as are experienced by the post-graduate student.\\"   \\"Child Psychology\\" (Prentiss-Hall), first published in 1933, went through its sixth edition in 1968.
