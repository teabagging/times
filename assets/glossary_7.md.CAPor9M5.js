Music From China, a New York-based group of recent emigrants from China, features Tang Liangxing, a virtuoso on the pipa (Chinese lute), who won a National Heritage Fellowship in 1993. He shared the spotlight in a concert that began and ended with ensemble pieces but featured solos on pipa, zheng (zither, played by Yang Yi) and qudi, bangdi and changdi (transverse flutes) and xiao (a vertical flute), all played by Wei Laigen).

Plainly, this is a group seeking to discard standard choral fare. Judith Clurman, the ensemble's director, is onto something wonderful here: for one reason or another, composers past and present have written reams of music for intimate choral groups, works that are seldom retrieved except on recordings.    The Alleluias were for the most part composed at Miss Clurman's behest. The exceptions were the works by Peter Mennin and Ned Rorem, the first of which had lain unperformed since 1945, the second so far neglected in New York. Miss Clurman requested short pieces from the other composers in order to fill out a segment of this program. The one that stood out was, inevitably, William Bolcom's intricate contraption, with medieval, Romantic and modern strands effortlessly interwoven.

A plausible guess now is that it will take another year to erase the effects of national recession -- and at least five more to complete the recovery in the badly depressed Northeast.  Two Reasons Cited     What went wrong? Americans are used to seeing the economy bounce back after recession. But the sharper business swings of the past are not useful as a benchmark for this recovery for two reasons, says Neal Soss at the First Boston Corporation.

At least that may in part account for the first-week crush at Mesa Grill, the Southwestern restaurant in the loftlike space formerly occupied by Sofi, on Fifth Avenue near 15th Street in Manhattan.    Gone are Sofi's cushy upholstered chairs and dramatic paintings, replaced by red vinyl banquettes with a cowboy-and-cactus motif, eerie yellow green chairs and perforated aluminum lights that look like innovative cheese graters.    Jerome Kretchmer (of Gotham Bar and Grill), one of the principals, has teamed up with Bobby Flay, the former chef at Miracle Grill. At this early date, his cooking is as colorful as a desert sunset, and well focused. Those expecting jalapenos won't find them","excerpt":"various peppers here are employed for accent, not injury. A vibrant starter is the grilled tuna tostada, with a well-grilled slice of tuna atop brassy black beans, a crisp flour tortilla and julienne of cooling jicama and mango ($8.50). The quesadilla of goat cheese, tomato and basil is tasty ($7.50), as is the terrific tamale holding moist cornmeal, shrimp and roasted garlic ($8.50).    Among main courses, grilled swordfish is exceptionally moist and delicious served with cilantro pesto and well-seasoned vegetables ($19); grilled strip steak is well turned out, accompanied by a mildly spicy red chili mustard and straw potatoes ($19.50). Only the grilled pork chops were dry ($16.50).    All of the desserts sampled were satisfying: pistachio devil's food cake, a creme brulee-like raspberry custard, and gingerbread ice cream sandwich (each $6). While Mesa Grill can be recommended for its titillating food, there is one caveat: the place is so loud it could knock a buckaroo off his mount at 50 paces.    Mesa Grill, 102 Fifth Avenue, near 15th Street, serves lunch from 11:45 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. Monday to Friday, dinner 5:30 to 11 P.M. Monday to Saturday. Closed Sunday. American Express, Mastercard and Visa accepted. Telephone: (212) 807-7400. Caffe Vivaldi     On a recent Arctic evening in Greenwich Village when oranges at sidewalk fruit stands ossified into boccie balls, we sought quick refuge in Caffe Vivaldi, at 32 Jones Street, just off Bleecker Street. The scene was as restorative as a country parlor: marble tables, a flaming hearth, classical music, an espresso bar and pastry displays. Most of the vaguely bohemian-looking clientele -- people even read there -- come for one of the assorted coffees, which include cappuccino ($2.50), espresso with Sambuca ($3.50), latte macchiato (glass of steamed milk stained with espresso, $2.50), caffe mocha (espresso, cocoa, steamed milk and whipped cream, $3.25) and caffe Viennese (double espresso, vanilla essence and whipped cream, $3.50). Also available are sandwiches, salad platters and ice creams. The dessert selection is extensive, although the lightweight tiramisu ($4.50) and the ultrarich chocolate mousse cake ($4.50) were unremarkable. Caffe Vivaldi serves from 11 A.M. to 2 A.M. daily. No credit cards. Telephone: (212) 929-9384). The Changing Scene     NEW CHEF: San Domenico, the luxury Italian restaurant at 240 Central Park South in Manhattan, has a new chef: Theo Schoenegger, who has been an executive with the Tony May Group, the owner of San Domenico, for two years. Before that, he owned a restaurant in the Italian Alps. He replaces Paul Bartolotta.   MENU ADDITION: Alison on Dominick Street, the French restaurant at 38 Dominick Street in TriBeCa, has begun a Sunday evening family-style dinner priced at $49 for two. It includes a tureen of soup; a whole roast chicken with garlic, potatoes and vegetables, and tarte Tatin. Reservations are necessary: (212) 727-1188.   OPENINGS: Ed Debevic's, the wacky 1950's-style diner that is a landmark in Chicago (and now has branches in six other cities), is coming to Manhattan on Feb. 11, at 661 Broadway, between Bleecker and Bond Streets. The 15,000-square-foot restaurant will include a 1940's style bar, a \\"bomb shelter\\" party room, a \\"1960's coffee house\\" and a staff dressed up like \\"greasers, jocks, prom queens, nerds and cheerleaders,\\" according to Richard Melman, the creator of Ed Debevic's.
