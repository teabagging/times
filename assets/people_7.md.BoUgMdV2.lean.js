In the decades since, prices for the finest examples have skyrocketed and on lesser quality works of art they have reached a plateau or plummeted as museums acquired the treasures and the number of collectors dwindled.

Next weekend the center's Summer Fair will bring merchants, mimes, magicians, artists and musicians to the plaza. For those who plan to visit then or anytime this summer, here are three worthwhile restaurants in the vicinity. (First of two columns on lower Manhattan.) Hudson River Club     250 Vesey Street, World Financial Center, (212) 786-1500 -- The Hudson River Club is a handsome, comfortable dining establishment facing New York Harbor, with the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island off in the distance. The food can be as inspiring as the setting. Appetizers on the Sunday menu include a crab-and-scallop bisque, duck liver mousse, a salad of greens with goat cheese, and duck-and-cabbage soup. Among main courses are corn-crusted scallops","excerpt":"a boiled dinner of lobster, shellfish and chicken; filet of salmon in a woven potato crust, and Black Angus steak. For something sweet, there is a dessert buffet. Dinner on Sundays is prix fixe at $29.50. Service is from noon to 6 P.M. (Review, Feb. 16, 1990.) The Odeon     145 West Broadway, at Thomas Street, (212) 233-0507 -- The no-frills Art Deco cafeteria on lower West Broadway is virtually considered the Fraunces Tavern of trendy TriBeCa. One element that fosters the Odeon's pioneering image is its stylishly threadbare appearance. The place looks as if it has been there since Jimmy Walker's administration, with its speckled linoleum floor, faded vinyl banquettes, steel-framed Formica tables and overhead fans. Over the years the bistro food has remained fairly reliable. Sunday dinner might start with a salad of fried baby artichoke, country pate, warm goat cheese salad or steamed mussels in white wine and garlic. Among the main courses are a vegetarian plate combining steamed asparagus, roasted peppers and couscous; linguine with a fresh tomato sauce; sauteed brook trout with almonds and mint, and roast leg of lamb with fava beans. Two of the desserts are creme brulee and strawberry shortcake. Appetizers range from $5 to $7.75; entrees, $12.50 to $20; desserts, $4.50 to $5.50. Sunday dinner is from 7 P.M. to midnight. (Review, Aug. 11, 1989.) TriBeCa Grill     375 Greenwich Street, at Franklin Street, (212) 941-3900. This upbeat restaurant is orchestrated by Drew Nieporent, the indefatigable professional who also owns the nearby Montrachet. The big, partly brick-lined dining room is generously spaced, and the noise level, while moderately high, is not distracting. The cynosure of the room is the big mahogany bar in the center, which revelers from the 1970's may recognize as the original bar from Maxwell's Plum. Sketches and large paintings done by Robert DeNiro Sr. adorn the walls. (His son Robert, the actor, is a partner in the restaurant.) Among starters on the current menu are fried oysters with thyme-marinated vegetables, grilled quail salad, tuna carpaccio with a citrus vinaigrette and crabcakes with avocado remoulade. Main courses include crisp honey-mustard duck with black pepper spatzle; grilled mahi-mahi with eggplant and tomato; capellini with seared scallops and basil, and lobster, a Sunday special, served with smoked-shrimp ravioli in a mushroom broth. In desserts, there are hazelnut cake stuffed with banana and wrapped in phyllo, baked-apple ice cream cake and glazed citrus cream with a poppy-seed crust. Appetizers range from $6 to $12, main courses $18 to $27; desserts are $6 each. Sunday dinner hours are 5:30 to 10 P.M (Review, July 27, 1990.) This listing is compiled by Bryan Miller from his restaurant visits, his reviews and articles in The Times, and entries in his Diner's Journal column. Review and article dates are in parentheses.

It bears the title of \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" and is pictured rather in the Mack Sennett vein, ladened with the pulchritude of the Hollywood studio variety.It is in the year 1960, when, through some curious plague, all males over 14 become victims and die. The women do not seem grief-stricken as they go about their respective duties with bright faces and weird costumes. The fashions are given to transparent hoopskirts and pantaloons or the simpler mode of the one-piece bathing suit. The Presidentess of the United States has permitted the White House to become a ruin, with towering weeds and high grass on the hitherto beautiful lawns. She is very fond of black cats, but does become unusually interested in the finding of a male of the species who is 34 years old. Being the first lady of the land, she insists that the last man on earth be sent to the White House. The discoverer, however, has an eye for money and holds that the man is worth at least $10,000,000.The Senatoress from Massachusetts and the Senatoress from California agree that there shall be a prizefight between two women to see who wins the lone man.The boys under 14 are pampered like weak girls, especially after the discovery of a serum which readers them immune from the plague. When Greenwich Gertie, a clever crook and leader of the much-feared Tea House Gang, comes across Elmer (Earl Foxe) hiding in the backwoods she believes that she has done more than the discoverer of the serum. Here you see Elmer being lugged into a hospital and examined by the physicians, while scores of women throng the passages outside. He is deprived of his beard and long hair and made to appear respectable, with trousers that flare and silk insertions in the bell-shaped extremities. He has to go to Washington to see the two political leaders, in bathing suits, fighting to win him. The Presidentess even permits him to sit in her chair. Elmer is the most petted man that has ever stepped on earth, and yet he does not appear to enjoy all the attention he receives.Merchants announce their appointment to dress, manicure and barber The Man and newspapers follow his every move. As an entertainment for the brain-weary this may achieve its purpose.

But now, finally, Congress is about to approve a credible and fair budget bill that will drive the deficit downward over the next five years.    The bill is full of quirks and half steps. And it makes two glaring errors, on capital gains and public investment. Yet it achieves substantial deficit reduction without hurting the poor or ravaging domestic programs. On balance, it will help the economy and open the way for Congress to get on with other pressing business.     The quirks and half steps need candid appraisal. The bill promises to cut the deficit by $40 billion next year and $500 billion over five years. It won't.  Next year's hit, counting expenditures in the Persian Gulf, will be closer to $30 billion. And the $500 billion estimate is based on improbable projections.   The package would hike the gasoline tax by 5 cents a gallon","excerpt":"a boost of 20 cents or more would conserve energy. The legislation does not eliminate a single weapons system. Entitlements were barely nicked. The ugly tax bubble -- whereby some families are hit with a higher marginal tax rate than other families with higher incomes -- remains.    None of these flaws, however, are fatal. What comes close is the provision concerning capital gains. Wednesday morning, the Bush campaign to lower the tax on the profit from selling stocks, bonds and other investments was declared dead and buried. But by evening a strange, stunted version was back on the docket. For wealthy families, the budget conferees would lower the capital gains tax to 28 percent, even though ordinary income would be taxed at 31 percent.   Why? No serious economist would argue that a cut this small could raise national saving, investment and growth. Its only purpose would be to hand wealthy families windfall profits on    past    investments. At a time when everyone else will be paying higher taxes, this provision is unconscionable.    The other unforgivable provision is a three-year cap on discretionary domestic programs. A provision that would require Congress to pay for new spending by raising taxes or cutting programs would make sense. But the budget bill veers irresponsibly in another direction. It would forbid Congress from spending more on child nutrition even if it would decide to spend less on missiles. In short, the bill would prevent Congress from doing what it is elected to do: make choices.      Despite these provisions, the budget deal makes subtantial progress. Over the next five years, it will push the deficit down decisively, and this time the budget cuts are real. Gone are the one-shot tricks and accounting scams Congress has routinely used in the past.    Six months ago, the agriculture committees were figuring out how to raise farm subsidies; the budget package will    cut    them by a whopping 25 percent. Well-to-do families will pay more for Medicare, setting a constructive precedent. And the package denies Mr. Bush his destructive proposal to cut the capital gains tax all the way to 15 percent.    For all the public disgust over dissembling and delay, Congress labored to make the budget package fair. It succeeded. Taxes on the poor will fall. Taxes on the very rich will rise by more than 6 percent. Everyone else will face a modest tax increase of roughly 2 percent.    Perhaps the finest part of the package is a decision to heap tax benefits on a segment of the population that hires no lobbyists: the working poor. Congress is prepared to approve an unprecedented increase in tax credits for poor parents who work as a way of helping them pay for quality child care and insulating them from excise tax increases.    The process wasn't noble. The product isn't exactly pretty. But, with the exception of two glaring flaws, Congress has done its duty.

Through a series of brutal but incomplete renovations, the Strand has become a pentimento in stone, with evidence of each past experience embedded in the building's new life. It has gone from movie house to bowling alley to its present incarnation as a studio for artists who work with glass. \\n\\nA fashionable theme in architecture has been to make conflict and incongruities apparent, rather than accepting the modernist belief that a building should be an object consistent within itself. In the 1970's, the artist Gordon Matta-Clark carved spaces through abandoned buildings with a chainsaw in an effort to change our experience of them. Nowadays, architects like Peter Eisenman and Bernard Tschumi try to incorporate contradictions in their designs. A site, over time, becomes a record of partially erased layers, to which the architect adds through reinterpretation. But the Strand's history is characterized by an innocence that has shown little concern for the building's architecture, which makes the rehabilitation it is undergoing that much more heartening.

Whether or not one agrees with these views, one must object to the manner in which Mr. Reston buttressed them.  Leaders of any peace movement do not ''put two million in the streets to protest the basing of the . . . missiles.'' People in a democracy, we are regularly reminded, are free to express their deeply held personal beliefs and values.  America, as Mr. Reston said, ''didn't pass the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe, or put 300,000 men (there) to be told that somehow they were not defending our common civilization.'' Agreed. But surely this doesn't suggest that decades later whatever we decide to put in the same area is done for the same reasons, nor that it will accomplish the same purposes.

Oswald (Nick Borjlind) is an 11-year-old who looks like a somber version of Macaulay Culkin. In 1959, he and his parents spend the summer with relatives in the country. His father, Tjaffo (Rolf Lassgard), is tall and heavyset but his greatness is all in Oswald's mind.   Tjaffo is a hapless drinker and womanizer, the kind who glides through life on charm. Among his most endearing actions, he organizes a local church choir and teaches them Argentine hymns. Oswald's mother (Ann Petren) is patient, understanding and totally without illusions about her husband. The most intriguing aspect of the film is Oswald's understandable hero worship of his father, an identification so thorough that the boy sometimes treats his mother with cruel neglect.

To watch Jean-Claude Lauzon's daring, bracingly original \\"Leolo\\" is to descend into a carnal nightmare, the dream of a clever and desperate French Canadian boy. His name is Leo Lauzon, but he has determined through sheer force of will to become someone else. Renaming himself Leolo Lozone, he imagines a new life as an exultant young Sicilian in an effort to escape the misery he faces at home in Montreal. Leolo's theory of his own genesis -- involving his corpulent mother (Ginette Reno), a Sicilian peasant and a sperm-laden tomato -- is typical of the bizarre lengths to which this boy will go to escape his fate.

Zoran sneaks around the rooms and, when unobserved, peels back the wallpaper to stuff himself with a building material he finds as satisfying as meringues.

For, although the story of the London Philharmonic Orchestra's fight for survival during the awesome days of the blitz is inexpertly fashioned, it nevertheless is warmly and pointedly told. And if the actors, most of whom are actual members of the famed aggregation, do not exactly measure up to Academy Award standards, then their orchestral performances more than make up the deficit.Among the latter are excerpts from Beethoven's Fifth, Mozart's Fourth and Sibelius' Second symphonies, as well as Tchaikovsky's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and Delius' \\"La Colinda\\" under the varied baton techniques of Sir Adrian Boult, Dr. Malcolm Sargent, Constant Lambert and Warwick Braithwaite. And to round out the musical fare, Moiseiwitsch and Eileen Joyce, concert pianists, appear with the group to play Rachaninoff's Concerto No. 2 and Grieg's Concerto in A minor, respectively.For the story's sake, J. B. Priestley deserts the literary field to whip up a benefit concert for the orchestra, the members of which had resolutely decided to continue as a unit under their own management rather than disband. And Jack Hylton, band leader, aware of the financial and cultural crisis, assists by arranging a tour of England's movie and variety houses to take the orchestra out of its native habitat to the vast audiences of the hinterlands. But, while these non-musical sequences may leave much to be desired, it is as a permanent record of an internationally acclaimed team of artists that \\"Battle for Music\\" is at once an unusual and rewarding film.

This production is virtually a photographic copy of the original, with little in the way of cinematic value, and the director has seen fit to include several scenes that are not only offensive but silly.The story is unfolded in a sluggish, unimaginative fashion, and, although the stage offering was no masterpiece, it seems that it might have made a stronger film than a play. With the exception of an actress named Gypsy Rhouma, who figures as the half-caste wanton, Tondeleyo, the acting is earnest, but more often than not the players recite their lines instead of conversing with each other. It is all very well for some of the characters to have certain mannerisms, but Sebastian Smith, who impersonates the drink-sodden doctor, is impelled to reach for the whisky bottle on the slightest provocation, and when he is giving a word of advice to newcomers to the plantation he invariably goes out of his way to put his hand on the other man's shoulder.There is a more or less successful effort to depict how young Langford brightened up his forbidding quarters with curtains, furniture and a phonograph, but when he finally becomes listless, having succumbed to the much-stressed \\"dry rot\\" of the wretched spot, the bungalow changes suddenly, without sufficient warning, to about the same state it was in when Langford arrived.As for Miss Rhouma, she never for an instant appears to realize what is demanded of her in the way of acting. This Tondeleyo looks more suited for an amateur musical comedy than for a drama.The ending of the drama has considerable merit, but, as in the play, the director never loses an opportunity of emphasizing the torridity and dampness of the insect-infested area. The characters never appear to be working, but merely preaching about the heat and partaking freely of spirituous liquors. It was to be expected that some idea of the labor in the place would be presented on the screen and undoubtedly it would have been if this play had been filmed in Hollywood. The steamboat comes and goes without giving one much idea of the passage of time. Persons remain silent for awkward periods, apparently thinking about their lines and cues.When Langford decides to marry, with a ceremony performed by the missionary, it hardly strikes one as plausible and it seems ridiculous when he looks at a ring he is to put on Tondeleyo's finger. Such ideas, however, were incorporated in the play, but even so they could have been made more human and really convincing in the film.The late Leslie Faber, as Weston, reveals his talent as an actor. He could evidently have done even better with less theatrical lines. Humberstone Wright acts the missionary. Maurice Evans, who plays Langford, looks as if he were acting for an old-time silent film. John Hamilton as Ashley does commendable work.The vocal reproduction is for the most part good, but there are passages where it is uneven in volume.On the surrounding program is a good short subject called \\"Bath Time at the Zoo.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A British Talker."},{"year":"1971","title":"NEWPORT, R.

The program had been postponed from Dec. 11. The juxtaposition of Church of England theatrics and South American tradition was initially jarring, but the performances had enough conviction to make the combination seem almost logical.   The Britten work is based on the life of the fourth-century bishop Nicolas, a rather fierce and fanatic dispenser of good works whom the modern figure of Santa Claus echoes as faintly as possible. The narration of various miraculous episodes culminates in Nicolas's bringing back to life three boys who had been killed and cooked by an unscrupulous butcher (sort of \\"Peter Grimes\\" in reverse). While the music is not Britten's finest, it has an immediate ceremonial effectiveness. Mr. Gardner expertly balanced and controlled the various vocal and instrumental forces, even though his chorus did not have an especially polished sound. Stephen Oosting gave powerful, accurate and at times moving renditions of the tenor solos. The audience enthusiastically joined in for two hymns.

But they could encourage restructering a portfolio, and certainly encourage an attitude of thrift. With that in mind, a discount broker may be the answer. \\n\\nThese brokers will trade stocks, bonds, mutual funds, precious metals or options for commissions that can be as much as 90 percent below what you would pay a full-service broker, said Mark D. Coler, whose book \\"Investing at a Discount\\" was published last month.\\n\\nDiscount brokers offer no investment advice. But unless you require considerable hand-holding before you make a trade, that shouldn't be an obstacle. \\"For most investors who know what they're doing and are seeking execution at the lowest price, discount brokers make sense,\\" said John Markese, research director at the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago.\\n\\nDiscounters offer a couple of other advantages over full-service brokers. One is that you can buy a variety of securities, including mutual funds, from several different companies and yet receive a single, consolidated statement listing all of these investments. Many financial planners recommend discounters to their clients precisely for that reason, even if the client's entire portfolio consists of mutual funds.\\n\\nYou can, of course, buy no-load mutual funds -- those without a sales commission -- direct from the company. But if you buy them from several different companies, you will receive a stack of statements, making it difficult to monitor your portfolio.\\n\\n\\"Financial confusion is at the root of many peoples' investment problems,\\" said H. Lynn Hopewell, a financial planner in Falls Church, Va. \\"People make big-buck mistakes from confusion.\\"\\n\\nFor example, Jonathan D. Pond, a Boston financial planner, says he recently acquired a new client who was \\"a superb investor.\\" But she \\"must have had 25 mutual fund accounts.\\" The only way to roll them into one and get a consolidated statement was to use a discount broker, he said.\\n\\nAnother advantage is that discount brokers do not have the potential for conflict of interest that full-service brokers do. A full-service brokerage house serves many different clients -- from corporations that issue securities to retail customers.  So it may commit to buy a big block of securities from a major client, planning to funnel some of it to you, whether it's right for your particular portfolio or not.  Brokers may also have a larger stake in selling you mutual funds or other products managed by their employer, on which commissions are greater. \\n\\nIf you decide to use discounters, how do you evaluate them? Consider commission, of course. If you want just the lowest commission, look for what Mr. Coler calls the \\"deep discounters.\\" When he prepared an index comparing 20 trades of about $9,000 per trade, he found that the typical full-service broker charged around $206 per trade. The largest discount brokers charged around $92 for the same trade, while the \\"deep discounters\\" charged $53. On higher-volume trades, the discount could be as much as 90 percent.\\n\\nMr. Markese suggests that you \\"come up with what is likely to be your normal trade.\\" Then get price quotes from several discounters. One percent or less of the price of the securities \\"is truly discount,\\" he said. \\"If you're paying 2 percent, you're paying full-service rates.\\"\\n\\nThere are both national discounters and regional discounters. If you use a regional broker, you should get a referral from friends or colleagues who are active investors and use discounters, according to Meloni Hallock, a senior manager in personal financial services for Price Waterhouse in St. Louis. \\"I wouldn't just look them up in the phone book,\\" she said. \\n\\nThink about how you plan to use your broker. Some discounters offer additional services, for a fee, of course. For example, Charles Schwab & Company, the largest discount broker, offers research on companies at $7.50 per company, according to Mark Goines, vice president of marketing. You get a report compiled by Standard & Poor's, current news headlines from Dow Jones and a consensus of analysts' outlooks.\\n\\nIf you plan to use a discount broker for your mutual fund portfolio, you'll want to know which mutual funds are available. Jack White & Company, one of the oldest discount brokers, offers 1,300 mutual funds, which Mr. White, the company's president, claims is the largest list available. The firm, which is located in San Diego, also offers competitive trading prices, financial planners say.\\n\\nIf you trade stocks, you need a broker good at executing trading orders. This is important if you want to trade at a particular price. For example, you might want a minimum of $31 a share. If the stock trades in a range of $30 to $32 that day, the broker may not sell at $31 if he or she doesn't act quickly.\\n\\n\\"If you save something on the trade, but they don't trade quickly and the stock is moving around, you might lose it on the price,\\" Ms. Hallock said. This can happen occasionally with any broker, she said, but if it happens to you frequently, you should take your business elsewhere.  \\nWhen to Go Full Service\\n\\n DISCOUNT brokers offer advantages for many investors but they are not for everyone. Here are some things you're more likely to get from a full-service broker: \\n\\n* New investment ideas. \\"There are a lot of people who need a nudge to think about their portfolio,\\" said Meloni Hallock of Price Waterhouse.\\n\\n* Seminars and research reports.\\n\\n* Negotiated commissions. \\"If you like to bargain and negotiate, you won't get it from a discount broker,\\" Ms. Hallock said. Even a beginning investor can negotiate some sort of deal from a full-service broker if he or she asks, although it would not be as good as one available from discounters. \\"It's very common to get a discount of 20 percent from a regular brokerage firm,\\" she said. \\"That won't happen with discounters because their margin is too thin.\\"\\n\\n* Personal attention.\\n\\nSome investors use both a discounter, for simple stock trades, and a full-service broker, for more complicated trades, like buying options. If you do use both, however, don't take your broker's ideas and execute them through a discounter","excerpt":"a broker who discovers you doing this will cut you off.

OBSERVER"},{"year":"1971","title":"Any movie that contains an argument about who hid the raisins intended for the spaghetti must be — at least in that part—as authentically and eccentrically American as the chewing of gum while eating corn flakes, even if it's cinéma verité of occasionally stage-managed truth.Such a film is \\"Derby,\\" which, like the Roller Derby it casually uses as a metaphor for one American dream, so mixes fact with fantasy that even its participants may not be aware when one leaves off and the other begins. The movie, which opened yesterday at the Cinema Rendezvous, Murray Hill and Juliet 2 Theaters, is funny without being exploitative, important without being unduly earnest.All of the people in \\"Derby\\" — the Roller Derby skating stars like Charlie O'Connell and Eddie Krebs, the would-be skating star, Mike Snell, his family and friends—somehow seem cheerfully disposed towards putting on an authentic show. The result is that \\"Derby\\" has both the authority of fiction and the ambiguity of truth, qualities that, when they were reversed, made Allan King's \\"A Married Couple\\" such a calculated, perhaps even self-deceiving, put-on.In his film, if you remember, Mr. King and his camera crew lived with a Canadian advertising man and his family through months of marital crisis, the details of which were presented as solemn truth, accidentally discovered. Much of \\"Derby\\" is equally intimate, as Robert Kaylor, the director, and his camera crew move in with the family of Mike Snell, a $147-a-week employe of the Dayton Tire & Rubber Co., to record something of the life of a young man who has no doubts about the identity of his dream.The difference between \\"A Married Couple\\" and \\"Derby\\" is hardly one of detail. Mr. Kaylor has gotten some remarkably personal footage of Snell family life, as when Mike, talking to his best friend, compares the sexual talents of various recent girl friends to those of his wife.There is a curious confrontation between Mike's wife, accompanied by one of her girl friends, with a lady down the block who has apparently been sleeping with just about any guy who'd drop around, including Mike. The women face each other across a patchy yard, talk in circles, call each other \\"man,\\" and then part by exchanging desultory threats. Barbara Loden's Wanda might well be living next door.This scene and a number of others were obviously set up for the camera, but the truth lies not in the spontaneity of the confrontation but in the rather sad and funny style with which it is played.The ultimate difference between something like \\"A Married Couple\\" and \\"Derby\\" is that the making of the movie is obviously a major factor in the lives being recorded, a kind of preview of the success Mike seeks as a Roller Derby star. There is nothing unseemly about this spectacle, as there was in the self-conscious intimacies of \\"A Married Couple.\\"If Mike Snell's story gives \\"Derby\\" its shape, scenes of the Roller Derby itself, an acknowledged amalgam of sport and pre-arranged spectacle, plus interviews with its various stars, give the film—and Mike's life—a fascinating context. Charlie O'Connell reminisces about the good things the derby has given him (a San Francisco hilltop house with a swimming pool)","excerpt":"a bunch of the derby's female stars tell adolescent dirty jokes; on two occasions, which are unrelated, young men show off for the camera the guns they carry—just, as they say, to be on the safe side. One of these is Mike's best friend in Dayton, who explains, in a matter-of-fact way, that he's tired of being hassled and beat-on by drunk hillbillies whenever he goes into a Dayton bar.\\"Derby\\" was commissioned by Jerry Seltzer, the son of the man who founded the Roller Derby in 1935, and who has nursed the derby through good times (in the 1950's, when it was a major television attraction) and bad (in the 1960's, when the public seems to have lost interest).I'm especially amazed that a film which was designed to be self-serving should be such an accurate report on a time and place, and should also have such an unsentimental regard for its people. For men like Mike Snell, there will always be the challenge of a new frontier, which, in this case, happens to be the Roller Derby.

What follows is a selective listing of restaurants, suggested by food writers and critics at The New York Times, that are justifiably popular with children and their parents. Although they are child-friendly, most serve alcohol, so babies can tug on their bottles of formula, older children on bottles of soda pop and parents on bottles of beer.  Upper East Side BARKING DOG LUNCHEONETTE 1678 Third Avenue (94th Street), (212) 831-1800.    Dogs -- warm, soft and fuzzy, cold, hard and porcelain -- are the leitmotif at this child-and-canine-friendly place. Outside, there is a blue tile water fountain for dogs.   Children do their slurping inside.  Breakfast is served all day because \\"kids at 8 o'clock in the evening want Rice Krispies,\\" said John Hawkins, the owner. On a Sunday afternoon, Sabrina Correa, 5, who lives in Manhattan, ordered her favorite meal -- a single pancake. \\"Plain,\\" she said, \\"with maple syrup.\\"   LEXINGTON CANDY SHOP 1226 Lexington Avenue (83d Street), (212) 288-0057.    Some places never change. In 1925, Soterios Philis opened this candy shop with a soda fountain shop and sold burgers, ice cream, and stuffed animals. Today it is run by John Philis, his grandson, and Robert C. Karcher.    Thomas Hughes, who grew up on the Upper East Side, ate breakfast here once a week as a boy and came around even more often as a teen-ager. Recently, on a hot Sunday, he brought his son, Philip, 2, to the same counter, for a coffee milkshake. The milkshake was a legacy, passed from father to son.    DALLAS BBQ 1265 Third Avenue (73d Street), (212) 772-9393.    While parents wait for their tables, their children play outside on the steps and roller-skate on the sidewalk. Inside, waiters arrive promptly, bring drinks quickly and even apologize if the food will take longer than 15 minutes or so.    Small children can split a platter of baby back ribs with french fries ($8.95), but an older child can devour an entire platter.    Be forewarned that the tab for children's drinks can total more than the food, especially if they inhale the nonalcoholic strawberry daiquiris ($4.50). PEPPERMINT PARK 1225 First Avenue (66th Street), (212) 288-5054.    Here the decor is intensely pink and green, from the striped awning out front to the flowered print on the chairs inside. There's even ice cream in pink (strawberry) and green (pistachio). But there are also selections that are not pink or green: hot dogs ($2.95), tuna melts ($6.25) and plump Belgian waffles ($4.25). Upper West Side   BOULEVARD 2398 Broadway (88th Street), (212) 874-7400.    Outside, at Boulevard's sidewalk cafe, Daniel Fisher, who is 15 months old and lives in Brooklyn, was perched in a highchair and with his hands was rocking the table back and forth, back and forth. But there was no need to panic.   When Daniel arrived, the waitress had brought a highchair immediately, then moments later a plastic cup full of orange juice and three plastic stirrers -- an orange flamingo, a green palm tree and a yellow giraffe.  Inside, each table was covered with drawing paper and set with a plastic cup full of crayons.    A children's menu offers seven entrees for $5.95, each served with milk or soda and ice cream for dessert.  Unlike most restaurants, Boulevard allows adults with birdlike appetites to order from the children's menu, too.    EJ's LUNCHEONETTE 447 Amsterdam Avenue (81st Street), (212) 873-3444.   In this 50's-style luncheonette, the banquettes are turquoise vinyl, and the walls are festooned with pictures of pink flamingos. Hannah Elliott-Higgins, 1, who lives in Manhattan, has already been here twice, mainly because her parents liked the fact that the waiter asked them immediately if Hannah wanted a child seat or would rather stay in her stroller.   \\"It's welcoming,\\" Julia Elliott said. \\"And that's rare.\\"   Hannah was a low-ticket customer.  She had an apple juice and some of her father's jumbo pancakes ($4.75).  MAIN STREET 446 Columbus Avenue (81st Street), (212) 873-5025.    All the signs of a child-friendly restaurant are here. There are huge sheets of brown paper covering the tables, and the requisite crayons. A highchair or booster seat is produced as soon as a small child is sighted, and drinks arrive with a straw. Parents don't even have to ask.   Both the architecture and the food, which is served family-style, are gargantuan. Light streams in from a huge vaulted skylight 35 feet high.  The meatloaf dinner ($19) will serve a family of four (two large appetites, two small).   LA CARIDAD LUNCHEONETTE 2199 Broadway (78th Street), (212) 874-2780.    This is 2-year-old Audrey Augenbraum's favorite restaurant. She comes in with her parents, Carla Scheele and Harold Augenbraum of Manhattan, once or twice a week.    So what's the appeal?    \\"Beans!\\" Audrey said.   The family had been seated at their table for only three minutes when a heaping platter of yellow rice and black beans ($2.80) arrived. Mr. Augenbraum spooned some onto his daughter's plate, and Audrey grabbed her spoon and tucked in.   \\"I don't think they want to be child-friendly,\\" Mr. Augenbraum said. \\"It just happens that their service is so fast, it works for children.\\"    The restaurant lacks one amenity: there are no booster seats, so Audrey's plate of beans was at nose level. Midtown HARD ROCK CAFE 221 West 57th Street, (212) 459-9320.   Cosette Decoste, 10, of North Attleboro, Mass., was grateful for small favors. She and her family were told they had to wait 30 minutes. \\"It wound up being 20,\\" she said, happily.  Cosette liked the nachos ($6.25) well enough, but the real appeal was the icons.   Elvis Presley's suit studded with hundreds of glittery stones is displayed in the middle of the main dining room.    And generally, the staff is accommodating. For teen-agers from Camp Shane, a weight-loss camp in Ferndale, N.Y., the restaurant served a low-calorie meal -- the bottom of a burger bun","excerpt":"a burger; zucchini, broccoli and cauliflower; a salad, and a fruit cup. The meal required a week's advance notice and cost $15.60 a person, including tax and tip.   PLANET HOLLYWOOD 140 West 57th Street, (212) 333-7827.    From 5 to 7 on a Friday evening, there appeared to be a happy child at every other table. They gawked at Slimer, the green ghost from \\"Ghostbusters\\" who was suspended from the ceiling. They stared at a huge movie screen, where there was a fast-moving film made from clips of movie stars feeding each other.   Jennifer Hebbel, 4, from Seminole, Fla., had ordered chicken crunch, breaded pieces of chicken ($5.95). She found no fault with the service. \\"They smile at you,\\" she said of the waiters.    BENIHANA WEST 47 West 56th Street, (212) 581-0930.    It was showtime at Benihana.   At one table a chef was slicing the tails off the shrimp on the hot grill, tossing them into the concave top of his red toque, and Robert Heller, 8, and his brother, Mark, 6, of Vineland, N.J., were oohing and ahing. Mainly oohing.   At another table, where Giovanni Colantonio, 5, of Medfield, Mass., sat with his family, a chef took two pepper mills and used them as drumsticks, rat-a-tat-tatting on the grill in the middle of the table. Then came Giovanni's shrimp. As the chef tossed the shrimp tails into his shirt pocket, a child sitting nearby asked her mother, \\"Wouldn't you hate to be his laundryman and find tails in his shirt?\\" As the shrimp sizzled, the chef sliced them and, with his knife, flicked them, one at a time, onto Giovanni's plate. Downtown   CHAT 'N' CHEW 10 East 16th Street, (212) 243-1616.   Sloppy children, the baggier the jeans the better, will probably feel at home in this funky evocation of a 40's all-American cafe, furnished with Formica tables and old tin signs that say, \\"Drink Coca-Cola.\\" The restaurant looks old, although it opened only last January.    Tables -- some round, some square -- don't match. The pinball machine doesn't work, and the popcorn machine doesn't pop.   The menu is quintessentially American with good choices for children, like Macaroni and cheese topped with toasted bread crumbs ($2.95 for a half portion).    COWGIRL HALL OF FAME 519 Hudson Street (10th Street), (212) 633-1133.    Shades of Dale Evans. In the windows are lariats and cowgirl hats and boots. Inside, the tables are covered with checked cloths, the mirrors framed with horns, the walls bedecked with pictures of cowgirls.    When children come in, they get a present: a paper headband printed with feathers, so they can immediately get into the silly, informal spirit that pervades this place.   And what do children order there?    Corn dogs ($4.25), said Paulette Merlino, one of the eight owners    ANGLERS AND WRITERS 420 Hudson Street (St. Luke's Place), (212) 675-0810.   A bouquet of white stock and blue delphiniums were in the window.  Roses in tiny vases sat on tables.  Fishermen's baskets hung from the moldings. All was pretty and serene at this oasis for people who like to take tea with their children.    Michela Vinton, 3, of Brooklyn, was shy and silent. But her father, Thomas Vinton, who had shared the high tea ($12.50) with his daughter, said that she had eaten the sweet stuff -- the scone, the strawberries and the peaches. And he ate the finger sandwiches.    JOHN'S PIZZA 278 Bleecker Street (Jones Street), (212) 243-1680.   People of all ages line up in the street for the pizza, which is baked in a coal-fired brick oven, the crust thin and blistered, the cheese bubbling ($10.50 for a large plain pizza). Toppings are old-fashioned: mushrooms, anchovies, onions, garlic, sausage, peppers. No smoked salmon. No clams. \\"Nothing like that,\\" said Bob Vittoria, who with Peter Castellotti owns the restaurant.    Tristan de Fontenay, 4, who lives in Newark, is a regular here. Since he was a toddler, he has been coming here about once a month. And if he spills his milk, no matter. \\"They don't mind,\\" said his mother, Celeste de Fontenay.   Tristan eats his pizza plain. \\"Nothing on it but cheese,\\" he said, forgetting about the tomatoes that were lurking beneath.    TWO BOOTS 37 Avenue A (Second Street), (212) 505-2276.    Lights in the shape of red, orange and yellow chili peppers are strung across the bar. Colors are hot. Music rocks. Children eat and draw in the coloring books that are dispensed to young customers. Last week, on a Tuesday night, every third table had a child or two.   Two of them were Danielle Buckley, 8, and her brother, Andrew, 6, from Clovis, Calif. They liked the pizza ($4.95) but not the music. \\"It's rock-and-roll,\\" Danielle said, her brow furrowing, her voice dismissive.  If she were the deejay, she said, she would have played folk music.    ARTURO'S RESTAURANT-PIZZERIA 106 West Houston Street (Thompson Street), (212) 677-3820.   Will Morris, whose son Keaton is 2, lives in Smithtown, L.I., and on a recent Sunday, he explained why this dim restaurant, famous for its coal-fired pizzas, was child-friendly.   \\"They offered the booster seat right away, they brought the orange juice right away, and they kept everything out of his reach,\\" he said.   So how's the food? The plain pizza ($10) got Keaton's vote. He waved it in the air like a moist red-and-white flag.   Arturo's has waiters who, when a child spills a drink, mop it up without batting an eye or glaring at the mess.  \\"More waiters spill stuff than kids,\\" said Jennifer Hirsch, a hostess.   What more could any parent want?   JERRY'S 101 Prince Street (Mercer Street), (212) 966-9464.    Adolescents seem to think that Jerry's, with its red leatherette banquettes, is cool. It's SoHo. People wear black and have hennaed hair.    Some adolescents order crisp, greaseless shoestring potatoes ($3.50), and the Caesar salad ($7.50), hold the anchovies. Stephanie Goureau, 11, of Manhattan, was eating eggs Benedict. She liked the food, she said, but best of all she liked the waiters and waitresses. \\"They listen to everything we say,\\" she said.    MEZZOGIORNO 195 Spring Street (Sullivan Street), (212) 334-2112.    The waiters radiate warmth to children (and adults). They bring paper-thin pizzas ($13 for a four-cheese pizza) within 6 to 10 minutes. For the more sophisticated youthful palate, they offer gossamer-thin raviolo wrapped around spinach or eggplant ($14) or shrimp ($15).   Casey Lynn Sweeney, 5, of Selingsgrove, Pa., liked the food (penne with tomato sauce, $12), but especially, she liked the atmosphere. The bartender said hi to her, she said, and she didn't have to sit on her seat. She could perch in the open window next to her table and dangle her legs onto the street.   MANDARIN COURT 61 Mott Street (Bayard Street), (212) 608-3838.    At least once a month, Brian Dutt, 13, and his brother, Michael, 11, travel with their parents from Riverdale in the Bronx to this restaurant in Chinatown. The boys have their favorite dishes -- pan-fried noodles ($6.95) and shrimp dumplings ($1.75).   As befits regular customers, they occasionally get a dispensation.  \\"Sometimes we get free soda,\\" Brian said.    Drop a chopstick, and the waiters will replace it -- amiably.

Kaufman in their play, \\"Once in a Lifetime.\\"It is true that some of the episodes are laughable, but where the two playwrights employed the gimlet technique, the poking of fun at Broadway stage producers in this film is done for the most part in a bludgeoning fashion.The good little woman, known as Doris, is impersonated by Winnie Lightner, who cannot be said to arouse much in the way of sympathy during the unfortunate moments when the narrative takes itself more or less seriously. In fact, it is mainly during the episodes in which Joe Smith and Charles Dale portray two stage producers, named Lou and Jake Delman, that the picture achieves a moderate success. Charles Butterworth struggles with some old jokes while trying to look busy as an underling in a stage costume concern and Walter Miller acts Doris's unfaithful spouse, who runs away with his wife's secretary.The laughter comes when a harebrained Russian director, named Vassily Vassiloff, is foisted upon Lou and Jake. They believe him to be a genius and there seems to be an idea that they want to produce an artistic spectacle. Vassiloff is temperamental enough to drive any producer mad. He has novel ways of doing his work. One day he wants elephants to pile teak, or something of the kind, and the next he has workmen busy tearing down the orchestra seats of the theatre. The worried Delmans ask where the audience is to sit and the director hints that they may occupy the stage. So far as the musicians are concerned, he has placed them in the balcony and they are not to have instruments, for Vassiloff intends to have them hum.It is no wonder that after the Russian has asked for ostriches and elephants that Lou remarks to Jake that this great artist will be wanting battleships next.Vassiloff demands that the theatre roof be taken off and also one wall. He thinks the open air will enhance the effect of his masterpiece. Instead of his show being a success, as one rather anticipates, the Delman brothers are driven back into the cheese business, with which they are supposed to have been familiar before tackling Broadway stage entertainments. Even then they are not safe from the mad Russian, who demands thousands of dollars' worth of Swiss cheese, which must have one large hole instead of holes of the usual varied sizes.Messrs. Smith and Dale know the business of buffoonery. Their arguments and the distrust they have for each other as Lou and Jake are indubitably humorous. It is a pity that there is never a suggestion of subtlety in this tale.The prismatic photography is invariably quite good.

Malabar set sail from Egypt, bound for Portsmouth, England, with a precious cargo stored in seven zinc boxes: 176,602 shares of stock in the Suez Canal Company, recently sold by the Khedive of Egypt. The buyer was the British Government, bolstered by a timely advance of 4 million [pounds] from N.M. Rothschild & Sons in London. Spiced with intrigue and flush with flamboyant figures, the affair has all the flair of a thriller. There have been bigger real-estate bonanzas -- notably the $15 million deal that won the Louisiana Purchase from France and the $7 million payment that wrested Alaska from Russia. But none have had quite the elegance, speed and daring of the Suez Canal transaction. It briefly established the House of Rothschild as a sovereign state on a par with -- or perhaps even slightly ahead of -- Her Majesty's Government.     Two decades earlier, the British were strangely myopic about the value of a proposed canal that would unite the Mediterranean with the Red Sea. Benjamin Disraeli, then the Chancellor of the Exchequer, dismissed the notion: ''The operation of nature would in a short time defeat the ingenuity of man.'' For the greatest maritime power on earth, this would prove a grave miscalculation, ceding construction of the canal to French capital and engineers, backed by Egyptian forced labor. By the time the canal opened in 1869, it had redrawn the map of the British Empire. The sea journey that had stretched 10,800 nautical miles from London to its imperial jewel, India, was slashed to 6,300 miles.

It is concerned with the purchase of a $500,000 pearl necklace and the hope of stealing it by a specialized band of jewelry thieves and—but it is perhaps better not to give away too much regarding the motive of at least one of the characters. This story has romance and stealth. It is in many respects ingeniously contrived and certainly not the sort of thing to send one into a doze. It has, moreover, clever snatches of dialogue. And in ringing its praises, it should not be forgotten that Clive Brook, that smooth and reliable actor, gives another thoroughly sound performance. His partner is Evelyn Brent, who handles her rôle competently.The comedy furnished by Eugene Palette as a grumbling multi-millionaire overall manufacturer is splendid. This nouveau riche specimen is known as Sylvester Corbett and the idea of finding himself with his wife and daughter in a huge villa on the French Riviera is far from amusing to him. Mrs. Corbett has a Pekinese which is mysteriously lost, much to the regret of Mrs. Corbett, but more especially of Mr. Corbett, who, in referring to its disappearance, says:\\"I do hope we will get the mutt back, for he is the one guy who has not tried to put the ritz on me.\\"Mr. Corbett is lonely, for nobody comes to call on the family in their spacious villa. He longs for America, but Mrs. Corbett has foreign social aspirations. She feels that she has been snubbed, but is not down-hearted. While they are discussing singing lessons for the daughter and the general expenditure of thousands of dollars, who should enter their abode but Lucy Stavrin, probably one of the cleverest jewel thieves there is in France. She is posing as an Austrian countess and that fact causes her to be doubly welcome. Her car has been stuck in a ditch, but the spectator of this film knows that it was no accident.She says she wants help","excerpt":"a car to pull her vehicle out. The spectator knows that what she really wants is the string of pearls, so finely matched that it took years to arrange them. The attractive Lucy has an excellent imitation of the genuine article and it is her duty, as her last crime, to purloin the real pearls and leave in the plush-lined box the handsome imitation string.Mr. Brook is introduced as the Hon. Courtenay Parkes, an Englishman of impeccable manners and dress, who is traveling with his man. Mr. Parkes is clever, but love is love and although one is kept in the dark events in this picture, it is a thousand to one that if a man looks at a girl through Paris windows in the first scene of any film, these two are not going to be very far away from each other when the story is concluded.This picture was directed by Louis Gasnier and Edwin H. Knopf. It is far and away the best motion picture with which Mr. Gasnier has been connected. Percy Heath is responsible for the story, in which the menace is one Malatroff, who controls his band of crooks by giving them numbers and, one presumes, threatening to expose them if they refuse to do his bidding. M. Malatroff is made sufficiently stern and forbidding by Paul Lukas.Helen Ware gives a nice account of herself in the rôle of Mrs. Corbett, the woman of wealth who is so zealous to be in society that she invariably seeks to kill her guests with kindness. Claud Allister impersonates Mr. Parke's man, Hawkins, with good enough effect to make one think that he is a splendid fellow to his master.M. Balieff's brief version of his \\"Chauve-Souris\\" is delightful and the various numbers are topped off with that ever fresh feature, \\"The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers.\\" THE SCREEN; Crooks and Pearls.

''I know a lot of office workers and they let me know how good it makes them feel.''

ART REVIEW","excerpt":"A Caribbean Take on Modern Styles"},{"year":"1991","title":"BECAUSE of a theft on March 3, the Museum of Cartoon Art's \\"Fantasia\\" show is missing five pieces. They are two watercolors and a celluloid featuring Mickey Mouse as the Sorcerer's Apprentice","excerpt":"a caricature of the animator Vladimir Tytla as the devil in \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" and a photostat of rooftops from the same sequence. All of them belong to the Mike and Jeanne Glad Collection, of which the show is an excerpt.   It is no news that there exist art lovers greedy enough to risk buying stolen goods. Still, the $5,000 offered for information leading to the recovery of these irreplaceable items may prove tempting to somebody in the know. If so, the number to call (no questions asked) is 937-6368.   Jackson Pollock and the other Abstract Expressionists get the credit for putting American art on the world map. But it is likely that a jury unmoved by esthetic class distinctions would nominate Walt Disney, who pulled off the feat decades earlier.   Although \\"Fantasia\\" was the master's magnum opus, it all but flopped at its first screening in 1940. Presuambly this was because a world at war was in no mood for a full-length cartoon that was, in the words of its maker, \\"a grand mixture of comedy, fantasy, ballet, drama, impressionism, color, sound and epic fury.\\"   So elated was Disney by this Wagnerian \\"gesamtkunstwerk\\"that he resolved to make a new version of it every year. But because of a strike and the war's economic side effects he could achieve only fragments of his grand scheme, one of them, incidentally, Wagner's \\"Ride of the Valkyrie.\\"   A lot went into the making of \\"Fantasia,\\" including the profits from \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\\" which were used to build a new center and to increase the staff to more than 1,000. Production started in 1937 with \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\\" then a short, with Leopold Stokowski conducting Paul Dukas's score. That the short metamorphosed into \\"Fantasia,\\" or \\"The Concert Feature,\\" as it was first called, had mainly to do with cost overruns, although Disney's identification with the mouse may have been a factor.   A label in the show quotes John Culhane, saying in his 1983 history of the project that \\"it was as if Walt were using Mickey to caricature himself and his dreams -- a conductor of artists rather than musicians -- who now looks over a cliff into the future and sees everything is possible.\\"   The show covers the eight movements of the \\"Cartoon Symphony\\" and its \\"Intermission\\" with works in pencil, pastel, crayon and gouache. Some are animation and storyboard drawings, others are inspirational sketches and still others are elaborate backgrounds for the action. No matter how deep the viewer's memories of the film are buried, the images are sure to bring them to the surface.   For this observer the most affecting reunion was with Stravinsky's \\"Rite of Spring.\\" Sad to say, the pterodactyls are absent but the celluloid of stegosaurus futilely dueling with tyrannosaurus rex is a beauty, likewise the backgrounds of a primeval swamp and incandescent volcanic landscape.   Still, the scene guaranteed to bring a lump to the throat is the one of a dinosaur (triceratops?) trudging off to die on parched ground under a white sun in an orange sky. There being no scientific consensus on the dinosaurs' fate, the Disney researchers settled on the theory with the greatest pictorial potential (unlike Gary Larsen, who has proposed in a cartoon that they died from chain-smoking).    Other high points in the show include the \\"Dance of the Hours\\" celluloids featuring the ostrich corps de ballet escorting the star, Mamselle Upnova, who is more or less en pointe, and Hyacinth Hippo in a vestigial tutu. Ms. Hippo, or her double, can also be seen in a pen-and-pastel reclining on a couch, like the Rokeby Venus but without a mirror. The models for the ostrich and hippopotamus ballerinas were none other than Irina Baronova and Tatiana Riabouchinska.   Although the \\"Pastoral Symphony\\" section is marred by a dreadful little blond centaurette with a bra made of flowers, it has the saving grace of Charles Philippi's layout, one of the few extant. It is a pencil drawing of Mount Olympus that has the same dreamy quality as a Grant Wood rural fantasy.   Contrasting with this is a color pencil abstraction that looks seismographic but in fact is the visual equivalent of a trumpet blast in \\"Intermission.\\" The only other abstractions are the Kandinsky-like pastels for Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor by Oskar Fischinger, a German pioneer in animation abstraction who left the studio because of creative differences with Disney.   Kay Nielsen, a major contributor to \\"Night on Bald Mountain,\\" and Maurice Noble of the volcano story boards are other names mentioned, but at least one-third of the works are anonymous. Apparently, Disney's artists were content to work as a team, like the unnamed artisans who put up the Gothic cathedrals.   A series of shorts plus a film on the making of \\"Fantasia\\" complete a show the like of which will not be seen again in this setting. The museum is foresaking its Charles Addams-like castle for premises that have yet to be built in Florida. In this reviewer's opinion, the museum will be nothing without its concrete castle; the two were made for each other. \\"Fantasia\\" remains through June 16.

Le Regence     Hotel Plaza Athenee, 37 East 64th Street, (212) 606-4647 -- Those who are familiar with the renowned Plaza Athenee in Paris will appreciate the Old World splendor of this New York branch. The dining room is a soft and stately den done in turquoise and white trim, with velvet banquettes, soft leather armchairs, ornate mirrors and benign lighting. The gentle art of conversation can be pursued here without a megaphone, and the European-style staff is meticulous and proper without being stuffy.   Brunch appetizers are served on a buffet table: cold lobster with mayonnaise, a selection of salads (curried chicken, mixed shellfish, mixed vegetables), charcuterie, poached salmon with fines herbs sauce, and an assortment of terrines and pates. Main courses include omelets, eggs Benedict, lamb stew, veal chop with mustard sauce, bouillabaisse Provencal, and filet mignon with bearnaise sauce. The buffet also holds an assortment of cheeses and desserts.  Sunday brunch, $33.50 prix fixe, is served from noon to 2:30 P.M. (Review, Jan. 8, 1988). Sign of the Dove     1110 Third Avenue (65th Street), (212) 861-8080 -- A rustically romantic ambiance combined with consistently excellent food by Andrew D'Amico, the chef, makes this a spot for special occasions. The main rooms, separated by brick arches with wrought-iron filigree, are enchanting with well-separated tables.    Brunch begins with beef and onion soup","excerpt":"a casserole of lobster, oysters and fennel; hearts of romaine lettuce with black pepper and anchovy dressing, and bow-tie pasta with braised duck, rape and mushrooms. Main courses include warm smoked Scottish salmon with scrambled eggs, caviar and fried quail eggs; grilled Moroccan-style salmon with tabbouleh and coriander oil; a sourdough sandwich of roast chicken, marinated peppers and bacon, and Portuguese-style chowder with clams, chorizo, potatoes and kale.

The pace of brunch is leisurely, and service is highly professional.  Appetizers and desserts are served on a buffet. For starters there are smoked salmon, half lobster with fresh horseradish dip, avocado stuffed with crab meat, Parma ham with melon, couscous salad, and a bean and shrimp salad with mint.    Current main course selections include scrambled eggs with grilled game sausage and wild mushrooms, grilled steak with matchstick potatoes and sauteed mushrooms, seared Atlantic salmon with saffron potatoes and two types of caviar, and grilled marinated chicken breast with endive salad.

Lighting in the coal-black dining room approximates that of a movie theater at intermission. Overhead spotlights illuminate solitary pink orchids on the well-spaced tables.Tuxedo-clad captains run the helpful service staff.   Sunday lunch offerings are nearly as varied as those at dinner. Starters include cold noodles in a peppery sesame sauce flecked with scallions; cold salad of shredded duck meat with strips of crackly skin, scallions, Chinese cabbage and coriander; barbecued quail glazed with garlic paste; honey-glazed baby spareribs and three types of steamed dumplings (pork, seafood and vegetables).

In her last novel, ''The Killing Ground'' - the fifth and concluding volume of a cycle of historical novels called ''The Beulah Quintet'' - Mary Lee Settle examined the reasons her heroine, one Hannah McKarkle, had decided to become a novelist, and she traced the impulse back to Hannah's need to understand her brother's death, her need to make sense of her own losses and her family's past through the redemptive art of storytelling. Though the backdrop to her latest novel could hardly be more different - swinging London of the 1960's, instead of the American South - this same theme reverberates through its pages. The characters in ''Celebration'' not only count themselves as survivors of emotional trauma (deaths, betrayals and other defections of the heart), but they also emerge as inveterate storytellers, jabbering away to one another - and to us - about their fears, grievances and dreams.

It relates the incidents of the great French military scandal dispassionately and with estimable clarity. The players in most instances bear a marked resemblance to those who actually figured in this cause célèbre.Cedric Hardwicke gives a methodical, quiet but impressive portrayal of Alfred Dreyfus. At the outset Dreyfus is stunned by the accusation of treason and later he is perceived going through the ordeal of having his galons and buttons torn off his tunic. The Devil's Island sequence shows Dreyfus shackled in a cell.The most stirring parts of this film, however, are those in which Maître Labori, Emile Zola and Colonel Piquart figure. The fearlessness of these men is brought out in a forceful fashion, particularly in the episode of Zola's trial for his editorial, \\"J'Accuse.\\" In contradistinction to them there is the duplicity of several officers on the military staff and Major Esterhazy's philandering, gambling and selling his country's secrets. Esterhazy, who, incidentally, died in England in 1923, is perceived making clever forgeries for the famous \\"bordereau.\\" His handwriting and that of Dreyfus are supposed to be strangely similar. He was the man who was the cause of sending the innocent Dreyfus to Devil's Island for five years and for creating a great social upheaval in France.Most of the details of the case, which started in 1894, are touched upon in this production and Zola's own words with regard to the truth finally coming out are employed in the sequence devoted to his trial. There is the finding of Colonel Henry a suicide and it is presumed that one of the military staff had put a razor in his cell after his admission that he had forged one of the documents in the \\"bordereau.\\" It is shortly after this that Colonel Piquart says that if he is found dead, it will be murder and not suicide.The dialogue in this production is adroitly penned, some of it evidently being quotations from newspaper reports of the time. The performers all do efficient work, with the exception of Garry Marsh as Esterhazy. Mr. Marsh is too desirous of emulating the stereotyped melodramatic villain, instead of impressing one with the character's shrewdness.At the end of this production comes the exoneration of Dreyfus, with a scene of him being decorated with the Legion d'Honneur and the guard walking by him. He was then promoted to the rank of major.And at the present time the former Captain Alfred Dreyfus of the dark days is now living in Paris as the honored Lieutenant-Colonel Dreyfus, retired.

Mikhail Bulgakov's \\"Cabal of Hypocrites\\" depicts Moliere's struggles against the Court of Louis XIV as a metaphor for the oppression of artists in his own country and time. The play had only seven performances when first produced by the Moscow Art Theater. This production was directed by Alex Darie, director of the Comedy Theater in Bucharest, Romania.    \\"The Eden Game\\" by Jock Doubleday, a alumnus of the State University at Purchase, focuses on the period before Havel became president of Czechoslovakia. Imprisoned in solitary confinement, he conjured up imaginary individuals to talk to. Much of the work was drawn from his letters to his wife, Olga. The production at the State University campus is a world premiere, directed by Alan Rust, founder of the Roger L. Stevens Center for the Performing Arts at the North Carolina School of the Arts.    Both plays will be performed by the senior acting company of the division of theater arts and film. Curtain time is 8 P.M., with a 3 P.M. matinee on Saturday.

Her talk will be the feature of a women's support session from 5:30 to 7:30 P.M. Wednesday at the White Plains Y.W.C.A., 515 North Street.

Re-released as a full-length feature in 1956, with seven additional segments, \\"Fantasia\\" became an instant classic.

The program will conclude the Sleepy Hollow Concert Association's 43d season Saturday at 8:30 P.M. Saturday in the Irvington Town Hall Theater.    Lewis Kaplan, a violinist and founder of the group in 1961, will be joined by Peter Basquin, pianist; Andre Emilianoff, cellist, and Charles Neidich, clarinetist. Tickets at $15 and $12 for children and the elderly can be reserved by calling 591-9242. COLE PORTER CENTENNIAL     It is certainly lovely to memorialize the bi- and tricentennials of the great European composers with avalanches of concerts, but how about giving the natives equal time? To that end an ensemble called \\"Three for the Show,\\" will perform a centennial program of the works of Cole Porter, born 100 years ago in Peru, Indiana. Lu Gmoser is the commentator, Susan Gmoser is the vocalist, and Larry Wasserman is the pianist.   The beguine begins at 7:30 P.M. Thursday in the Crestwood Library, 16 Thompson Street. Admission is free. FIDDLERS ON STAGE     If you liked that haunting musical theme in \\"The Civil War\\" public television series, you'll love hearing Jay Ungar in a personal appearance at the Towne Crier Cafe Friday at 9 P.M. Mr. Ungar, an accomplished fiddler, wrote and played \\"Ashokan Farewell,\\" as the ballad is called, as well as arranging all the music for the series.    He will share the stage Friday evening with Molly Mason, a fiddling colleague, performing music that ranges through the \\"Civil War\\" theme, Texas-style, swing, pop and folk.    The cafe is at 62 Route 22 in Pawling, and admission will be $12.50. Call 855-1300 for reservations or more information.

Performers have been hesitant to take them on, and composers have rarely followed Britten's lead in writing for cello solo. In her recital on Tuesday night at Alice Tully Hall, Hai-Ye Ni filled the gap, pairing Britten's neglected sonata with the world premiere of \\"A White Light Still and Moving,\\" by Bruce Adolphe, for solo cello.   With the sound-world of Britten's three suites as his point of departure, Mr. Adolphe established an independent voice through the sinuous manipulation of semichromatic motives. Ms. Ni, who plays with a softly colored, expressive tone, made a strong case for the score.

Together, they bring those interpretive and technical abilities to bear and offer the spirit of joint exploration and reasoned discourse that chamber music can be at its best.   At their recital at Carnegie Hall on Saturday evening, a listener who has heard these musicians many times was struck by the ways they have changed, particularly within the confines of their partnership. Mr. Ax, in recent years, has grown more assertive and colorful, both in his solo work and in his collaborations with Mr. Ma. And although Mr. Ma still plays with the vigor, clarity and timbral lushness that has always distinguished his playing, one now hears a kind of mellowness and suppleness that was not there in the early days.

They were written by Jose Marti in 1882 after the bare-knuckle boxing match between John L. Sullivan and Paddy Ryan in Mississippi City, Miss.   Marti was a Cuban poet and a patriot who lived in New York for 15 years, often writing for Latin American journals as well as The New York Sun. His accounts of the blizzard of 1888 and the death of Jesse James are just two highlights in a touching collection, ''The America of Jose Marti,'' published by Noonday Press in 1953. Another chapter deals with boxing, circa 1882:   ''The pen soars when it has grand things to relate, but it plods, as it does now, when it must give account of brutal things, devoid of beauty and nobility. The pen ... writhes like a slave, it flees the paper like a fugitive, it swoons in the hand that holds it as though it shared in the wrong it describes.

Todd Palmer, a clarinetist, took a different tack on Tuesday evening in a recital presented by Young Concert Artists at the Theresa L. Kaufmann Concert Hall of the 92d Street Y. His program consisted of works from this century, ordered chronologically from Claude Debussy's Premiere Rapsodie of 1910 to Joseph Horovitz's Clarinet Sonatina of 1981.   Affinity was therefore never an issue. Mr. Palmer's jaunty assertive style was well suited to those works and to others by Charles Ives, Francis Poulenc and John Mayer. But though the material was mostly fresh , there was a sameness to the evening, whose dominant elements -- sardonic humor and surface sensuality -- wear better in smaller doses.   Mr. Palmer is clearly a proficient artist, but whatever reserves of color and warmth he may command lay dormant throughout most of this music. Only in the hymn passages of Ives's Violin Sonata No. 3, which Mr. Palmer played in his own arrangement for clarinet and piano, and in \\"Marietta's Song\\" from Erich Wolfgang Korngold's \\"Tote Stadt,\\" which he presented as an encore, was any emotional depth apparent.   Still, Mr. Palmer's obvious affection for all of these works, and especially the Ives, was winning. And but for an occasional lack of fluidity or blasting fortissimo, his playing was admirable.   Carol Archer, the evening's pianist, collaborated strongly yet sensitively, carrying much of the load in the Ives. Robert Wagner, a bassoonist, joined Mr. Palmer in Poulenc's witty Sonata for Clarinet and Bassoon, but he didn't quite rise to Mr. Palmer's level of virtuosity.

The economy is perking along nicely, while unemployment is at its lowest point in three years and still heading south. Japan and Europe, by contrast, remain mired in recession.    Lest the celebration get out of hand, however, remember this: no economist able to pass a sobriety test is predicting that unemployment will fall much below 6 percent. That leaves the economy several million jobs shy of the 3 to 4 percent jobless rate that was considered normal during the 1950's and 1960's. The mainstream economics profession, it seems, is not only becoming reconciled to a 1980's-style world of poorly paying jobs for the unskilled, but has grown complacent to European-style rates of unemployment.

It sounds improbable, but on the evidence of an outstanding concert at Merkin Hall last Monday night, it might be the honest truth. After less than two years of collaboration, Paul Ostrovsky (pianist), Oleh Krysa (violinist) and Suren Bagratuni (cellist) are a trio of startling expressive powers. At the very least, they soar far above the workmanlike norm.   All three players share a background at the Moscow Conservatory. Mr. Ostrovsky, widely admired as a chamber musician, supplies a bedrock of cultivation and control. Mr. Krysa, who has pursued a brilliant if somewhat esoteric solo career, brings a searching interpretive intelligence. If the group has a flaw, it lies in Mr. Bagratuni's sometimes brusque attack.

Miss Caven's opening-night performance on Tuesday, for an engagement that extends through Saturday, was completely riveting. Backed by a quartet that included piano, violin, saxophone and bass, she sang a largely German program that featured songs by Peer Raben (who composed the music for many films by the director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, to whom Miss Caven was briefly married) and J. J. Schuhl. With titles like \\"Trans-Europe Tango\\" and \\"Polaroid Cocaine,\\" these songs are parodies of German art songs and offer deliberately cartoonish images of decadent European night life.

These 13 animated shorts, from two 1928 silents to a 1942 Superman propaganda film, highlight the Fleischers' particular style of anthropomorphism, and the nightmare logic that always seems to guide their work. The walls get angry and sprout knives","excerpt":"a character's hands keep waving without him; a tree puts on a coat in winter. Nothing is reliable; everything keeps moving. Only their exuberant momentum keeps these films from seeming mad.The program concentrates heavily on Betty Boop, and it includes nothing of the producing and directing team's most famous film creation, Popeye. But the program's most notable shorts are devoted to less celebrated Fleischer characters, such as Betty's tiny dog, who goes on a 1938 subway voyage in \\"Riding the Rails\\" and winds up home in bed, terrified of the electric train his mistress has given him as a present. Or Bimbo, who, in the 1931 \\"Bimbo's Initiation,\\" has an adventure full of spectral figures and terrifying sexual ambiguity. In \\"Grand Uproar,\\" (1930), one of the most enchanting films on the bill, an entire opera house becomes incorporated into a musical performance, ending in an ovation that quite literally goes through the roof.The Fleischers' \\"Follow the Bouncing Ball\\" device turns up in \\"Shine On Harvest Moon\\" (1932), in which the sweetness of the song (performed by Alice Joy, \\"Radio's Dream Girl\\") contrasts markedly with the animators' nastier flights of fancy. One of the more delightful aspects of the Fleischer program is its musical accompaniment, because two of the other shorts feature Cab Calloway (or an animated figure, drawn to mimic Mr. Calloway's movements) performing \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" and \\"St. James Infirmary Blues.\\"The two Superman shorts on the bill, both of them in color, are among the brothers' less successful efforts; their studio went out of business soon after the latter of these was made. These efforts are also quite revealing, because the Fleischers show so little aptitude for — or interest in — realistic animation styles. Superman and Lois Lane are at their most wooden in \\"Superman,\\" from 1941. So is the story's villain, a mad scientist. But the scientist's raven is wildly alive, like any real Fleischer creation, and the film sneaks in as many raven's-eye glimpses as possible. Heroic human figures have little to do with the grim, witty hallmarks of the Fleischers' imagination.

What makes Lynda Barry's first play a happy occasion is that she captures the innocent abandon of childhood with the wit of a mature writer but without letting go of the uninhibited child still lurking deep within herself.    Ms. Barry's uneven but highly promising comedy at the Second Stage, \\"The Good Times Are Killing Me,\\" is about Edna Arkins, a pre-adolescent girl of the mid-1960's who believes, for the duration of elementary school anyway, that miracles like movie stardom and racial harmony are to be had for the asking, no matter what obstacles parents might place in the way. Ms. Barry, a syndicated cartoonist whose strip, \\"Ernie Pook's Comeek,\\" appears in The Village Voice in New York, is just as free-spirited as her heroine in her first effort at writing for the stage. Like Edna, Ms. Barry at her best would rather hop, skip and jump than walk a straight dramatic line between any two points.

This means that the author was the reddest of the children of the leftist brigade. But seeing him onstage at Second Stage, one knows that he would be one of the last people to lead any march. Mild-mannered and self-effacing, he quickly learned how to duck for cover and avoid his father's wrath. Now, as an adult, he has become nostalgic about his family's political past: about the fact, for example, that his father would awaken him in the morning by singing \\"Arise, ye prisoners of starvation\\" at the top of his voice.   What defines the storyteller is his upbringing amid soapbox orators and folk singers who vied for the floor at every party. The milieu is akin to that in Michael Weller's \\"Spoils of War.\\" As the earthy father bullies everyone in sight, one realizes that there is material here for a play as well as a monodrama, about an impossible parent as seen by a forgiving son.

Ms. Malfitano's portrayal was riveting, no easy feat given the excesses of the Nikolaus Lehnhoff production, which had not been seen at the Met since 1990.         But her Salome is a product of sheer determination and intense dramatic involvement. Vocally, she managed to encompass the role, which ideally requires, in the unrealistic words of the composer, \\"a 16-year-old princess with the voice of Isolde.\\" But the effort she expended was enormous and audible.

It was also a year that kept performing standards up to a high pitch. But as far as a dominant esthetic goes, choreographers were less in agreement than a few years ago. Formalist values, expressed in pure-dance works, no longer held sway, although pure-movement pieces are still the signature mark of many. The current buzzwords in dance are ''narrative'' and ''emotion,'' and the self-appointed task in this area is how to tell a story in new ways.

But although the performances have given the choir considerable visibility, its director, Joseph Flummerfelt, is usually left sitting on the sidelines, having trained his singers in the works at hand and then passed them over to the orchestra's conductor for the performance.    Mr. Flummerfelt was on the podium at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday evening to conduct his remarkably well-polished chorus in a Christmas concert. Yet he did not keep the spotlight to himself. Among his soloists was Jennifer Larmore, a mezzo-soprano who was once a member of the choir and who has lately become a hot property in the worlds of opera and recital. Inevitably, attention was focused on her, and Mr. Flummerfelt gave her ample opportunity to shine in arias from Bach's \\"Christmas Oratorio,\\" Handel's \\"Messiah,\\" the Brahms Alto Rhapsody and Adolphe Adam's \\"O Holy Night.\\" Review/Music","excerpt":"A Chorus Out on Its Own"},{"year":"1929","title":"O Downes on Orfeo Catala THE ORFEO CATALA","excerpt":"A Chorus Which Has Made History-- Treasures of Spanish Music"},{"year":"1932","title":"Easter FESTIVAL IN ROME CHIEFLY RELIGIOUS","excerpt":"A Chosen Few Privileged to Hear Mass Sung by Pope in the Pauline Chapel.
