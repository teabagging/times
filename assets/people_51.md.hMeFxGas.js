Under the 38-year rule of the Liberal Democrats, which ended with a scandal-plagued bang last summer and resurfaced with a cynical power grab last week, there was rarely serious, sustained debate about Japan's future direction. The vision thing was the bureaucracy's thing. For everyone else in positions of power, there was too much money to be made to engage in such nonsense.

Both men championed photography as an art in the first decades of the century, Stieglitz in New York and Nojima in Tokyo, and both ran important galleries that promoted modernist art. Like Stieglitz, Nojima was at the center of a circle of avant-garde artists and writers in the 1920's and 30's, and some of his early pictures even look remarkably like those of his American counterpart.    But despite the many parallels between them, the two operated in very different contexts. By the time of his death, in 1946, Stieglitz had been recognized as a great photographer, responsible in many ways for awakening the United States to the provocative art being produced in Europe in the first decades of the century. Nojima, on the other hand, was forced by poor health and the rise of militarism in the 30's to withdraw from most of his artistic activities.

Mr. Monteiro's abilities wouldn't count for so much if he and his partner made music that was a shallow technical display. But the duo, who began an open-ended engagement at Michael's Pub (211 East 55th Street) last Tuesday evening, has a fine taste in songs, a rich grounding in jazz traditions and a remarkable musical rapport. Review/Music","excerpt":"A Jazz Singer With Backup By Accordion Band of One"},{"year":"1992","title":"A major figure in American jazz, Benny Carter has for the most part been denied his due share of popular recognition, the sort given to Louis Armstrong or Duke Ellington. The oversight calls for correction. That much is clear after watching \\"Benny Carter: Symphony in Riffs,\\" an hourlong documentary on the Arts & Entertainment cable channel at 10 tonight and then repeated at 2 A.M.    The profile, produced and directed in 1989 by Harrison Engle, is a bit lumpy, especially in its obvious plugs for certain airlines and cruise liners. But with Burt Lancaster as the smooth narrator, Mr. Carter comes through, in his customary style, as elegant and utterly dignified. Assorted figures in music, from Andre Previn and Quincy Jones to Ella Fitzgerald and Stanley Jordan, offer testimonials to the man's talent and style. But the basic biographical facts speak for themselves.

It was a rare Jazz at Lincoln Center event based more on pleasure than pedagogy. The concept was simple: love songs played and sung by worthy musicians, for an audience full of well-dressed couples. Of course, \\"My Funny Valentine\\" started the show, sung by Milt Grayson with stentorian reverence.    Betty Carter, the headliner, sang ballads with her magnificent timing and suspense. Performing obscure pop songs, Ms. Carter improvises in ways that sidestep the reassuring recurrences of verses and choruses. Instead, she concentrates with microscopic obsessiveness on each word, each phrase, each line, lingering over a crucial image, swooping ahead to the next idea, gliding with timeless languor over a trace of lovers' rapture or pausing to let a melancholy moment sink in.

The French jazz violinist, whose 85th birthday was belatedly celebrated at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday evening, might be described as the jazz world's answer to Pablo Casals. At a time in life when the hardiest performers begin to slow down, he combines the technical agility of a much younger musician with the refinement and far-sighted musicality of a seasoned artist who has honed his style to essentials.    That style, despite its use of popular songs as a springboard for improvisational flights, is really classical in its attention to pitch, tonal coloration and rhythmic flow. Taking a song like \\"Night and Day\\" or \\"Honeysuckle Rose,\\" Mr. Grappelli aspires to the same musical clarity and balance that a classical performer would bring to unaccompanied Bach.

This time it is costing $25 million, not the $7.5 million it took to do Windows the first time.

In February of that year, the Bourne auction house, which has specialized in decoys for more than 20 years, sold a shorebird, a Bill Bowman golden plover, for $50,000, then a single-bird record. And in October 1985, the $93,500 paid for two Lothrop Holmes redbreasted mergansers at Christie's American Sale in Manhattan was the most ever realized for a pair of decoys.

This is from \\"Nothing if Not Critical: Selected Essays on Art and Artists\\" (Knopf).   The traditional American frontier of horizontal space was receding into memory by 1920. In its place grew a new myth that supplied one of the core images of American Art Deco: the conquest of the air, by buildings and machines -- the taming of vertical space. The aircraft, with its fairings and streamlines, became the formal metaphor for a host of products from milk-shake machines to staplers. . . . Meanwhile, as static conquest of the air, the skyscraper multiplied the site, extruding a patch of earth into a stack of pure property: the abstract, universal sign of capitalism. The standardization of its floors invoked the image of the machine, just as in the use of bodies as mechanical parts in Busby Berkeley's choreography or the precisely drilled production-line kicks of the Rockettes. . . . As the utopian form to end all others, the skyscraper manifested itself as chair backs, bookcases, table lamps, cocktail shakers and, of course, refrigerators.  Ironic Warriors     Some of the most characteristic features of modern culture emerged from the experience of artists in the world wars. This is from the introduction by Paul Fussell to \\"The Norton Book of Modern War\\" (Norton).    Modern war takes place within a context of cultural \\"modernism\\" and indeed is one of its causes. To the degree that conscripts become alienated from official culture, with its rationalizations and heroic fictions, they enact one of cultural modernism's main gestures, visible in such figures as Joyce, D. H. Lawrence, the early T. S. Eliot, Robert Graves, Pound, and W. C. Williams. A disillusion resembling that of soldiers who have fought is one of the most noticeable motifs in modernist culture, and so is the war between the generations -- the older clinging to myths of idealism, the younger practiced in skepticism and proficient in rude plain-speaking. . . . But the most pervasive contribution of modern war to modernist culture is irony, widely perceived to be, as Monroe Engel has pointed out, the \\"normative mentality\\" of modern art, just as it is the expected tone in modern war writing. Seeing Things as They Are    Tourism emerged in Britain in the 18th century, but the intent of travelers then was eminently serious. This is from \\"The Englishman's England: Taste, Travel and the Rise of Tourism\\" by Ian Ousby (Cambridge University).    When an eighteenth-century writer like Richard Twiss speaks of \\"rambling about the world\\" he does not have in mind anything like the frivolous leisure pastime that phrase might now suggest: he is praising an activity which for him, and his age, \\"proves the greatness of the mind of men, and the immortality to which it aspires.\\" Travel was a leading instrument of that post-Reformation spirit of inquiry which valued empirical knowledge over abstract speculation or book-learning derived merely from tradition. We learn by going out and seeing for ourselves, by becoming travellers. \\"The use of travelling,\\" said Samuel Johnson (and note that he said \\"use,\\" not \\"pleasure\\"), \\"is to regulate imagination by reality, and instead of thinking how things may be, to see them as they are.\\" The Freedom of the Hills     The naturalist Edward Abbey, who died in 1989, believed that a trip into the wilderness isn't just restorative -- it may be one of our last unabridged rights. This is from Abbey's \\"Down the River\\" (Plume, paper).    The modern urban-industrial world -- like the feudal world -- offers adventure and freedom to a certain elite, the aristocracy of our time: to the rich, to the scientist, to the star athlete, the big-time entertainer, the techno-warrior, the artist    arrive   , the successful politician, a few others. But most, the overwhelming majority, seem condemned to the role of spectators, servitors, dependent consumers. . . . But one exception remains to the iron rule of oligarchy. At least in America one relic of our ancient and rightful liberty has survived. And that is -- a walk into the Big Woods","excerpt":"a journey on foot into the uninhabited interior; a voyage down the river of no return. Hunters, fishermen, hikers, climbers, white-water boatmen, red-rock explorers know what I mean. In America at least this kind of experience remains open and available to all, democratic.  The Metaphoric Universe     Todd Siler argues that the metaphor is as essential to scientists as to writers. This is from \\"Breaking the Mind Barrier: The Artscience of Neurocosmology\\" (Simon & Schuster).    A rich metaphor can be a gold mine for hypotheses relating the properties of different systems. Such is the case of the German astronomer Johannes Kepler's concept of the \\"music of the spheres\\" that helped the science of astronomy listen anew to its description of the universe. Kepler's metaphorical views of the cosmos . . . identified a number of unsuspected relations between familiar things: arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. Kepler approached astronomy through metaphor, as he intended to \\"uncover the magic of mere numbers and to demonstrate the music of the spheres,\\" the harmonious nature of the cosmos. His speculations, which were based on the rigorous astronomical observations of Nicolaus Copernicus and Tycho Brahe, provided the seminal thinking for Isaac Newton's theory of gravitation. And this theory opened the door to modern science -- a door that Kepler's contemporary the Renaissance scientist Galileo had built from his belief in systematic, experimental evidence.

It is a craftily contrived film, most of which is photographed in technicolor, and just the sort of thing that will fill children with mingled feelings of awe and delight. There are a few dialogue sequences, but the greater part is silent except for the so-called sound effects.It is a long film, perhaps a trifle too long, but it is strikingly ingenious and effectively directed by Lucien Hubbard. It is also well served by the J. E. Williamson's undersea photographic work, which was filmed off the Bahamas. This production has had a hectic career, for work was started on it more than two years ago, but after a few months it was temporarily abandoned.In this production Lionel Barrymore delivers another of his competent portrayals, and even though this film is a thriller, and a queer one at that, Mr. Barrymore is always human as the marvelous scientist, who invents a submarine with a special gauge air-pressure which permits the craft to travel down to and along the bottom of the sea and stay for what seems to be an indefinite period. But woe is it to the crew of the fish-like submersible if the air gauge goes wrong, as it does aboard one of the craft.There are underwater sequences with rocks like a skyline of New York and Martian-like creatures whose bodies look as if they were an evolution of the diving suit.There are, in fact, diving suits aboard the strange submarines fixed so that the crew can stand in the leg part and touch a lever and the upper section drops over the wearer. After clamping down the fastenings the individual is able to leave via the bottom of the submarine and go forth for a promenade on the bottom, of the sea or for a clash with the querulous, gluttonous natives. He can even go big-fish hunting, for now and again in these absorbing scenes one perceives an octopus ready to attack anything from a crowd of submarine natives to the submersible.There's no end to the sights in this film. As one thinks of the dragou of the deep, which crawls around like a brontosaurus and is ready to make a meal of a crowd of sea dwellers, one also remembers that this forbidding specimen of life makes his abode in the vicinity of a sunken Roman galley, on which are seen the skeletons of slaves shackled to the seats.The sea-dwellers are as busy as ants. There are swarms of them getting ready to take possession of the submarine, while the heroine, Sonia, a gentle creature, keeps her word to the crew of one submarine by asking the hero, Lloyd Hughes, to bring with him to the other craft the all-important air-pressure gauge, which is not working on submersible No. 1. And one recollects the coming of the happy ending, when Sonia and Nikolai (Mr. Hughes) are not a little disappointed that they cannot kiss under the sea in their bronzehued diving suits.Montagu Love is seen as a theatric villain named Falon, who would steal secrets from Dakkar (Mr. Barrymore) and if possible the whole Mysterious Island. He meets with an end deserving of his wicked nature—a death undersea, with scores of sea-natives gloating over his blood, red stuff that astonishes them and causes the little creatures to want to give the flesh and blood persons a run for their lives.Although this picture may be overlong, it is never tedious, for Mr. Hubbard and Mr. Williamson have used imagination and skill in dealing with the weird scenes.

Miss Ayupova had all the necessary technical equipment, including a buoyant jump, beautifully fleet and articulate little feet and easy, centered pirouettes. What made the performance so interesting was Miss Ayupova's handling of the character. Her Juliet was an adorable little wren who was as recognizably of her own time and the late 20th century. This was a thinking Juliet, full of all the required passion but with a considering air, in acting that was naturalistic but that had all the elegance of the classical ballet form in which it was embedded.    Aleksandr Gulyayev was an endearingly young Romeo, a little sad and dreamy from the start and growing in passion and wisdom as the ballet progressed. Mr. Gulyaev's long, tapering legs and body made his Romeo elegant, and his partnering had all the right ardor. There was a profound change in character unusual in most Romeos when Mr. Gulyayev engaged in a truly frightening all-or-nothing duel with Tybalt.

By plotting trajectories, astronomers have traced the likely source of comets to the outer reaches of the solar system. But not until last week were they able to report definitive sightings out that far. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, they detected 30 objects, each from four to eight miles wide, in a flat disk extending far beyond Neptune's orbit.

It is, instead, a completely economic plague.     The disease has only rarely been detected in humans. But in animals like cows, pigs and sheep, it causes blisters in the mouth and feet, making it painful for them to eat or walk. In the worst cases, the hooves can fall off. In young animals, the disease can be fatal.

February 4-10","excerpt":"A Killer Theory"},{"year":"1991","title":"From the shores and the heights of this hilly North Shore village, families once watched Long Island Sound for ships returning from voyages that took as long as five years. There were nine ships in the Cold Spring Harbor fleet of 1836 to 1862, three-masters that hunted whales for the oil that illuminated 19th-century homes and lubricated the Industrial Revolution.   The Tuscarora, the Barclay, the N. P. Talmadge, the Monmouth, the Richmond, the Alice, the Huntsville, the Splendid and the Sheffield vanished into history after petroleum was discovered in Pennsylvania. Yet every day but Monday, the fleet comes to life at the Cold Spring Harbor Whaling Museum.   The village was named for the underground springs that its early settlers found. \\"Harbor\\" was added in 1826, when it got its first post office.   The museum is a modest one-and-a-half-story structure that might escape a driver's notice among the boutiques, antiques shops, toy stores and whatnot stores along Main Street, the portion of Route 25A, or Northern Boulevard, that runs through the village. It's a better town to walk in than drive, with sidewalks and ample parking space in public lots.  Creating an Illusion    Awaiting the visitor inside the museum are, among other things, whale bones and teeth","excerpt":"a killer whale skull the size of an easy chair; a trypot, a cauldron the size of a small bathtub in which all meat was removed from whales' blubber, leaving only the precious oil; and a 30-foot whaleboat.   These memorabilia of the American whaling era, which died out by 1925, are fascinating in themselves, but the era itself seems to come alive in the commentary of 10 interpreters, as the museum calls them. They create the illusion that they not only know all about these things, but were there.   One interpreter is Jack Abrams, a retired teacher and principal who lives in Northport. Mr. Abrams was recently found standing at the starboard side of the whaleboat addressing an intent audience across the thwarts from him on the port side.   The boat, he said, was used to pursue whales; the whaling ship itself, which displaced 300 to 800 tons of water, was far less nimble than the boat and its manpower of six oarsmen, a tillerman and a harpooner. The boat could quietly pull alongside a whale swimming at its traveling pace, about 7 miles an hour; if alarmed, the whale would shoot away at about 20 m.p.h. Boys and Whales    \\"The boats go after the whale after it's surfaced and spouted to clear water out of its blowhole and breathe,\\" Mr. Abrams said. His glance fell on a blond youngster. \\"You -- yes, you!\\" he said. \\"If you've been swimming under water, what do you do when you come up? Show me.\\"   \\"Well, I, er,\\" the boy said, and blew out of his mouth and nose.   \\"Exactly! Exactly,\\" Mr. Abrams said. \\"You and the whale blow out the water. You're not fish; you're mammals. You blow out of two nostrils, he blows out of one, and the men in this boat get him.\\" (Mr. Abrams does well with children. Ann Gill, the museum's director, said that of 47,500 visitors last year, more than 17,000 were students at private and public schools in New York City.)   Mr. Abrams strode to the whaleboat's bow and pointed to a half-circle cut into the coaming, a very short deck over the bow area. \\"This,\\" he said, \\"is what they called the clumsy cleat. It's for the crewman who uses this . . . \\" He picked up a harpoon from the boat.    \\"The man puts his thigh into the curve to steady him,\\" Mr. Abrams went on. \\"The harpoon's not for killing, but lancing, or hooking, the whale. If the man stabbed down as hard as he could, hitting a vital center in the whale, it would rear up and smash the whaleboat. The crew hooks him and wears him out, then tows him to the ship.\\" Scrimshaw on Plastic    The whaleboat is no replica. It was aboard the Daisy, a ship on which Robert Cushman Murphy, an authority on oceanic birds and Lamont Curator Emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History, took a voyage in 1912. He later bought the whaleboat and offered it to Cold Spring Harbor on the condition that it be protected from the elements. A large stone shed was built for it in 1942, and the museum grew up around the shed.   The names of the village's nine whalers are listed on a wall of a classroom in which youngsters are taught scrimshaw. Instead of whalebone, they carve plastic picnic spoons and knives. Beside the list of ships is a small but striking diorama of a harpooned sperm whale rearing from the sea to crush its tormentors, the tiny crewmen of a tiny whaleboat; their attitudes bespeak terror.   \\"The Whales: Can They Be Saved?\\" a film with starkly graphic footage from the 1920's, is shown at various times daily. Mr. Abrams offered an affirmative postscript to the film's title -- that the gray whale and the humpback whale are gaining in population. Live Exhibits    On the way to the whaling museum, drivers approaching from the west might like to drop in at the Cold Spring Harbor Fish Hatchery and Aquarium, which lies in a valley on route 25A, less than a mile from the village's downtown. The exhibits here are alive: brook trout, brown trout, rainbow trout, carp, salmon, sturgeon and turtles swim in or bask around outdoor pools.Some swim in an aquarium building.   That building's major attraction is a living cross-section of a pond somewhere upstate. All the creatures seen here are natives of New York State's inland waters or unwitting immigrants, dumped into ponds and streams by unthinking pet owners. Another aquarium holds smaller fish, salamanders and frogs, which peep out of their cages' camouflage at children trying to spot them. A round pool outdoors contains trout ready for breeding.   Both the hatchery and the whaling museum are owned by the village. Both are also champions of preserving endangered species -- the museum for the largest creatures in the sea (and on earth) and the hatchery for the creatures of its state's ponds and streams. GETTING THERE    Cold Spring Harbor is 33 miles from Manhattan, and the Long Island Rail Road station is three miles south of the whaling museum, with no public transportation. So driving is the way to go.    From New York City, take the Long Island Expressway to the Northern State Parkway at Roslyn. Take the Northern State to South Oyster Bay Road, follow it north to Route 25A, or Northern Boulevard, and there turn east (right) and follow 25A into Cold Spring Harbor. Sunday parking is not restricted and the village's lot, on Route 25A, is very large.   No refreshments are sold at the hatchery or the museum. Each has rest rooms. For hungry children (or grown-ups), in the village proper are the Inn on the Harbor and the Cold Spring Harbor Restaurant.   The museum is open from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Sunday. Admission is $2 for adults, $1.50 for those over 65, $1 for students 6 to 18 years of age and free for children under 6. The hatchery's hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $2 for adults and $1 for those over 65 and children 5 to 12 years old. Children under 5 are admitted free.

The story is no longer boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl, and the triangle is no longer a situation in which someone gets left out. With a little warmth, sadness and whimsey, everyone gets a little of everybody.In \\"Hugs and Kisses,\\" which opened yesterday at the Beekman Theater, a young middle-class Bohemian couple (Agneta Ekmanner and Sven Bertil-Taube) take in an eccentric young writer (Hakan Serner) whose hairline is beginning to recede, who has a sad, awkward, comic air and who can't sleep at night without being read to and without holding an old piece of cat's fur against his cheek. One night, the writer brings a frowzy typing instructor (Lena Granhagen) home to sleep, and to get rid of her the young married pair decide, quite drunkenly, that the wife ought to sleep with him. In the morning, the wife holds this against her husband and, just to straighten things out emotionally, she sleeps with the writer once again. Her husband, feeling disconsolate, goes to the guest room and draws the writer's old undershirt on over his business suit.There are a lot of nice things: A lady pianist playing Chopin in one scene, her music forming the accompaniment for the scene that follows (the background music throughout the film, by Bengt Ernryd, is fine)","excerpt":"a kind of dreamy white, almost overexposed light over everything; a lot of well-written conversation that implies things not actually going on on screen, which adds a kind of resonance to the plot; the tight but imaginative husband, self-consciously proud of showing a little emotion, saying half humorously,\\" \\"Look at this tear. You saw it, didn't you?\\"; the little fond, despairing convention among the friends of repeating something one of them has just said directly after him. There is a scene when the writer brings the couple their breakfast in bed and jumps on the bed to eat it with them—a genuine eating scene, with a lot of scrunching and sipping and touching of hands in trying to reach the marmalade. And there is a nice piece of dialogue in which, after the writer has deceived the typing instructor about what his profession is, and the deception has been exposed, the typist asks him whether he thinks her hair is bleached or really blond. He says he thinks it's blond. She tells him it is bleached. And they know they are going to get along together.In the end, the film (directed by Jonas Cornell) suffers from the same uncertainty and lassitude the characters have, its whimseys not always inventive, its charm not as clear and new as some of its predecessors.But it is a nice movie all the same. And there is a friendly little orthographic modernism in the subtitles (which, like subtitles in so many black and white films, are often white on white and a little hard to read): \\"Don't be scared. That's not a beatle,\\" the writer says to the husband about an insect crawling toward him. And there are two more references to beatles crawling toward their picnic on the grass.

Granger, a tall, dark-haired, muscled gent, who was involved with gypsies before in \\"Madonna of the Seven Moons,\\" is again caught up with gitanos (Granada gitanos, that is) in \\"Caravan,\\" which came to the Beacon Theatre yesterday. The trip from Britain to Broadway and Seventy-fourth Street was wasted. For Granger and the rest of the cast alternate between grappling with stilted lines and an embarrassingly archaic situation with neither the players nor plot making much entertainment, while \\"Caravan\\" moves with the speed of an oxcart.Set in England and Spain of 1830 the many skeins of the yarn have Granger, a novelist who is commissioned to transport a fabulous necklace to Granada, seek the culprits who make off with that bauble.

Meredith Documentary, 'A Yank Comes Back,' at Symphony -- 'Caravan' at Beacon"},{"year":"1926","title":"When the last, reel of \\"Her Honor the Governor\\" had flickered off the screen there was no doubt that a woman Governor could have almost as tough a time as Job. Nearly everything that could happen to the widowed Adele Fenwick after she was elected to the position of chief executive of her State did happen, even though it was awfully hard work to keep on feeling sorry for her. There is a limit to human sympathy and it was reached long before the last blow fell on her bowed shoulders. To be sure, truth is sometimes stranger than fiction, but fiction may also be stranger than truth.The predicament of \\"Ma\\" Ferguson, Governor of Texas, was probably the inspiration of this picture, but Governor Ferguson can thank her stars that her misfortunes were real and not the product of the studio. Perhaps it was the intent of the author to show what would make all the feminists rave, that leadership in politics and the maternal instinct must result in an awful muddle. Even at her inauguration Adele Fenwick, whom Pauline Frederick did her best to make human, nearly succeeding despite the appalling nature of her task, was upset to see her son getting his feet wet. And although Governor she is still a woman, for she dusts her own office in a boudoir cap and sews a button on her son's coat in the Executive Chamber.Once in office Governor Fenwick defied the politicians to do their worst, and they did. The brilliant thought came to a cocaine-shaken follower of Senator Dornton, the boss, to ruin the Governor by stealing the divorce papers of her dead husband, who had been married once before, and permitting Dornton to brand her as \\"an unmarried mother\\" on the evening before her son's wedding.The indignant son knocks one of Dornton's men down stairs in a club row, and when the cocaine-soaked person wallops this person over the head with a cue and kills him, the son is blamed for it. He is tried for murder and found guilty, and when the Governor threatens in court to prevent this miscarriage of justice by using her pardon power, she learns that she has just been impeached for \\"moral turpitude.\\" What is a poor woman to do in a situation like that? The only thing the Governor can think of is to cry. But in the meantime the murderer is traced, the divorce papers punched out of the boss by a devoted friend, and the Governor retires from politics and gets married agai—which again would probably be exceedingly unsatisfactory to the feminists.Miss Frederick does what she can as an able actress with her impossible part, for the story is incredible and makes one wonder what other unnatural thing will happen to the poor lady before they get through with her. There is something radically wrong with the court room scene, in which a murder trial is well staged up to the point at which the Governor rises, \\"not as Governor but as the mother of this boy,\\" to make an eloquent plea to the jury in the middle of the case. The most lenient judge who ever graced a bench would not permit her to talk as much as she does, and dash so madly around the room. And when the verdict is announced the scenes have been so mixed up in putting the picture together that after the judge asks the jury whether their verdict is guilty or not guilty, the foreman answers: \\"We have.\\" He is replying to the previous question, as they say in parliamentary language.Snipe Collins, a weak creature, half crazed with drugs, is well played by Boris Karloff. Many such a wretch has been dragged into Police Headquarters. His shaken, jerky figure, the twitching mouth, the vicious anger which vents itself on a helpless man who has tormented him for years, is, next to Miss Frederick's, the most authentic piece of work in the picture. Even the plot with a few changes would be good, but no plot could put over quite as much unnatural adversity in such a short space of time as enveloped this unfortunate woman Governor.

To use a Minimalist vocabulary for such unabashedly anthropomorphic purposes is somehow comical. Joel Shapiro's blocky, puppetlike figures are similarly funny.

But I liked it a lot when I saw it again the other day, which may prove that anything, even a movie critic, can improve with time.It may prove something else, however","excerpt":"a law I'd never care to formulate, but which might suggest that certain works of art, and especially certain movies, only get to look as good and as individual as they really are after their time has past. \\"Black Peter\\" is very much a film of the early nineteen-sixties, of the life styles and movie styles of the time, and when it first played here, I think that many of us had grown prematurely weary of the early nineteen-sixties — and of the era of cultural cross-fertilization that brought the techniques and subjects of the New Wave and the Twist and the bikini to Eastern Europe.But now Forman's obligations, though no less apparent, seem less important. And the style, which had looked like feeble imitation, reveals itself as a personal understanding of a particularly subtle, genial, unassertive kind. \\"Unassertive\\" may be the operative word here, for Forman's specialty in \\"Black Peter\\" is a comedy so quiet that it sometimes becomes positively mute.Peter (Ladislav Jakim), at the age of 17, takes a job in a supermarket, where he is made store detective. Like Truffaut's Antoine Doinel, to whom he is a kind of inarticulate first cousin, he thus finds himself in a position of considerable low-level responsibility, with which he is completely unable to cope.He arrests no shoplifters—though he does follow one suspicious character all the way home without stopping him because he can't think of what he should say. With similar mastery he courts his girl (Pavla Martinkova) and suffers the lectures on success and manly labor, that are regularly provided him by his father (Jan Ostroil, in an ultimately hilarious performance).\\"Black Peter\\" doesn't really have a story, even in the way that Truffaut's Antoine movies have stories, and, given Forman's comic vision, it is proper that it should not. Instead it has a series of events and interconnected anecdotes and a sense, absolutely unassailable, that even behind its most threatening mask, life bares a face of disarming helplessness. \\"Black Peter\\" isn't about anything so pretentious as the brotherhood of man, but it acknowledges a brotherhood of man (and women) that is at once consoling and quite sadly funny.For the most part, \\"Black Peter\\" is about a small town's summer months, and I cannot remember a film so wonderfully sensitive to summer pleasures. Teen-age dances, swimming in a river, a band concert, luncheons, songs by local talent at the central restaurant. Forman's studies of amateur musical aspiration would in themselves make a movie, and his willingness to value such aspiration at any level of achievement would go a long way toward indicating in what spirit a movie ought to be made.Nobody, finally, can say what he means, and so everybody stumbles into an embarrassed, or merely feckless, silence. This is very funny, but more importantly it is also very true. For in that pause between the gesture and the word, between the intention and the meaning, lies the unspoken, the all but unspeakable awareness of the painful joy of daily living.

He was 99.   The cause was heart failure, said his son, Bernard, a sculptor in New York.   Mr. Kirschenbaum, who celebrated his 99th birthday at a party at Sotheby's auction house last week, began selling books at the age of 8 from his father's pushcart in lower Manhattan. He rose to the top of the book trade by helping industrialists, bankers and other businessmen form holdings of American books and manuscripts, especially those written by the Founding Fathers and Abraham Lincoln. Some of these collections are now in the Library of Congress, the Pierpont Morgan Library, the New-York Historical Society, the Clemens Library at the University of Michigan and the Fales Library at New York University. The Martin Library    One of Mr. Kirschenbaum's clients was Henry Bradley Martin, an heir to the steel fortune of Henry Phipps, a partner of Andrew Carnegie. The 10,000-volume Martin library brought $33 million at auction in 1990. Mr. Kirschenbaum sold Mr. Martin one of the treasures of his collection, George Washington's copy of The Federalist. Mr. Kirschenbaum had acquired it in the 1940's from Phoebe Hearst, the mother of William Randolph Hearst, for $5,000. At the Sotheby's auction of the Martin collection, the copy of The Federalist brought $1.43 million.

The Government's statement was accompanied by declarations from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security chiefs charging the Palestinian leadership with giving an indirect ''green light'' for terror attacks. Security forces maintained a high alert after Friday's bombing in Tel Aviv.   A1    Palestinian police officers faced the wrath of their own people as they tried to control a crowd hurling stones at Israeli soldiers.   A6    Zaire Leader Ends Isolation   Zaire's ailing President, Mobutu Sese Seko, made his first public appearance since returning home. He promised to unite his country, but gave no indication of how he planned to do it. Western diplomats predicted that he might resign, form a new Government or create a ''national council'' free of his control and give opposition parties a greater role in government.   A9    An American Army airborne unit arrived in Congo to prepare for the possible evacuation of Americans from Zaire.   A9    Chaos Continues in Albania  Albania's President, Sali Berisha, dug in his heels and said he would not be ''blackmailed'' into resigning.  Rebels from the port of Vlore, for their part, repeated their demand that Mr. Berisha go. One group from Vlore circulated a petition threatening the head of the secret police with death unless he resigned. Inflation soared.   A8    European officials said the European Union was expected to provide a small contingent to provide security for the delivery of food and other aid in Albania.   A8    Philippine Cloak for Korean   Reporters scrambled frantically in the Philippines to try to find a North Korean defector being given refuge there temporarily after he was allowed to leave Beijing. The Government confirmed that he was in the country, but reporters were marveling at the success of officials at keeping their secret.   A4    Belarus Expels U.S. Envoy  An American diplomat was asked to leave Belarus after taking part in an anti-Government rally, state television said. The statement said that the embassy's first secretary had been detained during a protest against the President's pro-Moscow policies. In Washington, the White House said that the official would comply.   A8    Burmese Religious Conflict  Officials tightened security in the capital of Myanmar, formerly Burma, because of religious conflict. The unrest began a week ago in Mandalay, when Buddhist monks attacked mosques after reports that a Buddhist girl had been raped by a Muslim man. Monks play a major role in the affairs of the largely Buddhist country.   A6    NATIONAL   A10-13, B5-6    Deal With Cigarette Maker Yields Little for Smokers   Thousands of smokers and their families stand to gain little financially under a proposal in which one of the nation's large cigarette makers would settle all present and future lawsuits by smokers, their survivors, cities, counties and insurers. An Alabama judge has given preliminary approval for the settlement with the company, the Liggett Group. That settlement is separate from one in which Liggett agreed to admit that smoking is addictive and causes cancer.   A1     Drug Corruption on the Border   Law-enforcement authorities said they had mounting evidence of systemic corruption of Federal and local officials by drug dealers in some remote counties along the Mexican border. Some of the suspicions involve customs and immigration inspectors, who had long been considered trustworthy defenders against the influx of marijuana, cocaine and heroin.   A1     Rabbis Argue Over Judaism   A group of Orthodox rabbis said it would issue a statement declaring that the Reform and Conservative movements, the more liberal branches of the faith, are ''not Judaism.'' A spokesman for the group said the statement was timed to  counter efforts by Reform and Conservative leaders to gain official recognition for their movements in Israel. The statement was criticized by a number of Jewish religious leaders, including the president of the nation's largest Orthodox rabbinic organization.   A11    New Guideline on Mammograms   The American Cancer Society recommended that women begin annual mammograms to detect breast cancer at age 40. Until now, the cancer society had urged mammograms every year or two for women in their 40's. The society's board of directors announced the change at a science writers' conference.   A10    Thaw Floods North Dakota   Runoff from melting snow flooded hundreds of homes across North Dakota as ice jams sent rivers pouring over their banks. Several residents had to leave Beulah and Hazen, N.D., two small towns roughly 50 miles northwest of Bismarck where the Knife River spilled over its banks. The National Weather Service issued flood warnings for broad areas of western and south-central North Dakota, after two days of temperatures in the 50's.   (Reuters)    2 Slain in Philadelphia   Two women were bound, gagged, raped and killed in the West Philadelphia row home they shared, the police said. Arnim Evans, 28, of Philadelphia was charged with murder and rape after officers pulled him out of the home of the victims, Pamela Blue, 24, and Roseann Young, 35. Six unharmed children, ages 1 to 9, were in the home. The police said Mr. Evans was an acquaintance of the women. Capt. Joseph Mooney said the women appeared to have been strangled.   (AP)    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-4    Whitman Assailed on Plan To Cover Pension Shortfall   Governor Whitman is seeking to borrow  $2.9 billion over 35 years to help cover a shortfall in New Jersey's pension system -- the first time any state has floated bonds to cover pension liabilities. She faces a $750 million budget gap in a year when she is running for re-election. Her critics said the plan would burden future taxpayers with the costs of the tax cuts she boasts about now.   A1    Objections to Private Prison   Several New York State officials said they objected to a company's proposal to build a privately owned prison in the Catskills and take in prisoners from other states. State law prohibits New York's own prisoners from being housed in private prisons, and Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco said he was not sure that the law would even allow the prison to take inmates from elsewhere. Officials in Fallsburg, where the prison would be built, said they needed it to shore up their tax base, especially since the State Senate's vote in January against casino gambling in the Catskills.   B1     Schumer Criticizes Tuition Rise   Representative Charles E. Schumer criticized Governor Pataki's proposal to increase tuition for New York's public college students by $400. Mr. Schumer, a Democrat who is thought to be considering a challenge to Mr. Pataki next year, urged the adoption of his own plan, which would allow parents to create tax-exempt savings accounts for tuition while their children are young.   B2     Giuliani Defends End to Plan   Mayor Giuliani vigorously defended his decision three years ago to dismantle an affirmative action program that steered city contracts to minority-owned businesses. He said the program, begun under Mayor David N. Dinkins, was of questionable legality. Critics have charged that minority-owned businesses are suffering under Mr. Giuliani.   B2    Children See Murder-Suicide   A man fatally shot his estranged girlfriend inside her apartment in upper Manhattan and then killed himself in front of the woman's teen-age daughter and 2-year-old son, the police said. The children were not injured. The police said the deaths were the culmination of a dispute between the victims.   B3    SPORTSMONDAY   C1-9    Arizona and N. Carolina Win  Arizona yielded a 7-point lead with 1 minute 15 seconds to play, but held on to defeat Providence in overtime, 96-92, to win a trip to the Final Four. The Wildcats will face North Carolina, which earned its fourth -- and least expected -- trip of the decade to the national semifinals by exploiting Louisville's limitations in height and shooting ability to win, 97-74. The other semifinal game will pit Minnesota, which defeated U.C.L.A. 80-72 on Saturday, against Kentucky, which beat Utah 72-59.   C1    Nets Apologize for Outburst   The Nets publicly apologized for an outburst in which Coach John Calipari had called a reporter a ''Mexican idiot.''

They have introduced supercomputers to spot drilling sites and sophisticated equipment that can even drill sideways (box).

The new policy, which would deny Federal funds to colleges that award scholarships to minority students on the basis of race, became public the day after the Secretary, Lauro F. Cavazos, resigned following a meeting with the White House chief of staff, John S. Sununu.    The connection, if any, between the departure of Mr. Cavazos and the promulgation of the new policy was at best murky. The White House insisted there was none, but some people close to Mr. Cavazos, who was the first Hispanic Cabinet member, said he was upset by the scholarship policy. In any case, some Bush aides had considered him a candidate for cutting because his low-keyed style was seen as undermining Mr. Bush's professed concern with education.    But there was considerably less concern in education circles about Mr. Cavazos's departure than about the implications of the new policy, which caught educators, civil rights leaders and, apparently, some top White House aides by surprise. Michael L. Williams, the assistant secretary for civil rights who announced the change, said he was simply trying to bring education policy in line with overall Administration policy on affirmative action, racial quotas and the like.   Caught off guard by the initial round of outrage -- a host of leading educators called the new policy variously shocking, obscene and unconscionable -- the White House moved to soften reaction by promising what Mr. Bush called \\"a quick readout\\" on the implications of the ruling. White House aides stressed that the policy change was not at the President's behest and that it was \\"easily reversible.\\"    The heads of some education groups argued that enforcing the policy would undercut years of efforts to increase the number of black and other minority students. But others noted that the policy would not affect minority recruitment at the many colleges that actively seek minority students but offer them aid based on need or merit rather than race. In addition, schools under court order to increase minority enrollment would not be subject to the new policy, Mr. Williams said.    Nevertheless it was clearly a genie that the White House wanted back in the bottle. One Republican strategist said that the policy grew out of a \\"defensible legal position,\\" but that \\"from a political standpoint it stinks.\\" Headliners","excerpt":"A Learning Experience in Education Policy"},{"year":"2011","title":"Security locks and aesthetics","excerpt":"a lease becomes month-to-month; “right of first refusal” for condo boards.

Hitting off the same tees  as their rivals at the Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf in Austin, Tex., the pair  of history-makers created an additional sensation by opening with a five-under-par 65, then faded a bit to 275 and a tie for 19th in the 28-team better-ball field. The publicity was bountiful, the response generally warm. ''I never heard a gallery pull for me like this before,'' Miss Wright said before leaving Austin.         All in all, the invitation to Misses Wright and Whitworth seemed like a good  idea. But it won't be happening again, at least not in the near future. In a letter to Commissioner Deane Beman of the PGA Tour, Fred Raphael, the Legends tournament's director, has given assurances that no exemption will be sought next spring to allow Miss Whitworth, who is 46 years old, into a field that, like all others on the Senior PGA Tour, is supposed to be restricted to golfers  50 or over. And without Miss Whitworth, Raphael says, a two-female team is simply not practical, because there is no woman other than 50-year-old Miss Wright who meets the age qualification and plays well enough to make her team competitive.

A1    The death penalty for Mr. Hussein and two of his co-defendants brought jubilation to Shiite and Kurdish neighborhoods across Iraq, gloom to Sunni ones, and a political blessing for its current, embattled prime minister.   A11    Taiwan's Leader Admits Lies  President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan admitted he submitted false receipts for reimbursement from public funds and lied to prosecutors about how he spent the money, but said he had done so in the interest of national security.   A6    China Sets African Trade Deals  China and a number of African nations agreed on 16 trade and investment deals valued at $1.9 billion, as Beijing extended its efforts to create a broad economic and diplomatic partnership with Africa.   A6    Nicaraguans Vote for Leader  Nicaraguans went to the polls to choose a new president in a five-way contest that primarily focused on one contender: Daniel Ortega, the former Marxist president who fought American-backed contras in a bloody war in the 1980s.

A8    NATIONAL A12-19    G.O.P. Finds Issues For Rallying Its Voters  President Bush seized on the sentencing of Saddam Hussein as a ''milestone'' in Iraq, seeking to rally Republican voters with the issue of national security as some polls suggested that his party might be making gains in the final hours of the campaign. The White House said the timing of the announcement, two days before Election Day, had nothing to do with American politics.   A1    Campaigning Coast to Coast  To inspire his troops on the last big day of campaigning for the midterm elections, Representative Mike Fitzpatrick, a Republican in his first term, pulled out a favorite weapon of Republican candidates in the same predicament: Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican whose reputation as a maverick makes him an appealing attraction.   A17    In one of the tightest races in the country, Indiana's Ninth Congressional District, an important economic concern, high gasoline prices, has been somewhat alleviated in the past few weeks as the price at the pump has edged down.   A17    A new poll, which queried 400 likely voters and was published by The Miami Herald, found that 49 percent said they preferred the Democratic challenger, State Senator Ron Klein, to Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. , who drew the support of 40 percent of respondents.   A17    As volunteers lined up to carry the last paper sacks of leaflets into a web of suburbs to the west of Chicago, Iraq loomed over the tense race for the Congressional seat that is being vacated by Henry J.

With Democrats appearing within reach of gaining the six seats they need to take control of the United States Senate, New Jersey has become a focus of national attention. B1    State Republicans Cry Foul  Anticipating historic political losses in New York on Election Day, state Republican leaders are lashing out at the national party in Washington, saying it has exploited New York donors and missed opportunities against a prime target, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. They say that, despite pleas for help, they have been ignored in Washington.  B1    Cigarette Trade in Jeopardy  The tax-free sale of steeply discounted cigarettes by the Shinnecock Indian Outpost in Southampton is what keeps the tribe alive. But now the cigarette trade is being threatened by both a federal lawsuit and an expected push by the New York State government, which estimates it loses $576 million a year in the sale of untaxed cigarettes.  B1    Brooklyn Development Faulted  Even in Greenpoint-Williamsburg, an area familiar with growth and gentrification, the sweeping changes wrought by the city's rezoning have left many residents feeling dizzied, and there is a sense that the government has not moved fast enough to keep pace with developers.

Max was a hugger par excellence, a habit that started in early childhood when his parents tried to teach him how to shake hands in greeting; he preferred hugging. Visitors to the LeRoy household were routinely assaulted by a dark-haired, dark-eyed ball of energy who threw himself at them, hugging whatever body parts he could best reach. After what became his signature hug (just a little longer, just a little tighter and just a little more loving than anyone else's), Max would step back to ask the hug-ee's name. He embraced life just as ferociously and with as much abandon. And he had an enormous capacity for living, because he was so prodigiously talented. The word ''best'' always surfaced when Max was discussed by his family and friends. He was the best musician, the best writer, the best cook, the best at getting the party going, the best at getting the girls, the best son, the best brother and the best friend.

There is more than enough material here for a novel or a Spike Lee film. In the new play \\"Ali,\\" Geoffrey C. Ewing and Graydon Royce brush in the highlights and succeed in jogging one's memory about this admirable athlete, a man of principle as well as punch even as he became a self-made egotist. He was, as he proclaimed, the Greatest, and he had the record to prove it, a record that was interrupted during his prime years when he was stripped of his title because he protested against being drafted for service in the Vietnam War.   As it turns out, there is more heat in Mr. Ewing's performance in the title role than in the monodrama he and his collaborator have constructed around Ali's life. As directed by Stephen Henderson, Mr. Ewing is an artful imitator of his character, assuming the muffled voice of Ali today as well as the boisterous braggadocio of the young champion.

Their choices were revealing, but in the end all made sense: Scott Turow's affinity with his fellow Chicagoan Saul Bellow is both personal and geographic, John Irving is a famously Dickensian novelist - and hasn't Norman Mailer always been in fictional pursuit of the White Whale? Scott Turow as MR. SAMMLER          'I would have been the Count of Monte Cristo, but I am not prepared to face  the world in skintight breeches. And besides - although it was Dumas's novel that first fired this boy's imagination, the works of Saul Bellow were the medium through which I developed a more mature interest in literature. A Chicagoan, a Jew, a member of my parents' generation, Bellow was for me in all regards a definitional writer, an extraordinary unit of measure, the incarnation of haute literary respectability and an unparalleled master of the American idiom. For me, no character more fully embodies the most compelling aspects of Bellow's remarkable sensibility than Mr. Artur Sammler, an Anglophilic, Polich-Jewish expatriate, who, in his final years, is an uneasy resident of the  city of New York. A powerful intellectual, Sammler, in 1969 - the year of the lunar landing - contemplates whether the human spirit is fit to reach beyond the earth and to transplant itself to the moon, the planets.

And when the corn is as abundant and juicy as it is in \\"The Sainted Sisters,\\" Mr. Fitzgerald really is up against it and deserves unstinted appreciation for holding such a gossamer production together. This time he is a cute Mr. Fixit to a pair of beautiful confidence girls who are heading for the Canadian border with bustles full of money and get detained in a small town in Maine.Under the benign influence of Mr. Fitzgerald, who is not above tampering with the sheriff's mail and thus discovers that the gals are wanted by the New York police for fleecing an aged playboy out of $25,000, the Stanton Sisters become reluctant do-gooders.

Blame the critic Jan Kott, if you want, whose 1964 essay on the comedy's sinister subtext banished forever the notion of a happy, gauzy fairyland. But ever since, it has been impossible to read about a new production without wondering if it's going to be Jungian or Freudian, feminist or phallocentric, ad infinitum.         Which is why it's nice to be reminded that the play is also primally funny, with a humor as close to director-proof as that of any comedy ever written. For  its 10th season, the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival, on the grounds of the Boscobel Restoration here, is reasserting the simpler charms of \\"Dream\\" as an amiably silly diversion for a real midsummer's night.

I have sent quite a few,\\" wrote Lieut. Joe Tom Meador in a letter to his parents dated June 17, 1945, two months after a collection of 10 priceless medieval church treasures disappeared from a closely guarded cave on the outskirts of Quedlinburg in central Germany. The Nazi Government had hidden them there for safekeeping during World War II.   \\"There are two that I want to know about for sure,\\" he continued. \\"One is a box that contains a book, the cover of the book has a statue of Christ on it. By all means, if it gets home take extra good care of it. I have an idea that the cover is pure gold and the jewels on the cover are emeralds, jade and pearls. Don't ask me where I got it! But it could possibly be very very valuable.\\"    Lieutenant Meador's identity as the Quedlinburg thief was disclosed by The New York Times in June 1990. Lawyers representing the Government of West Germany and the owner of the treasure, the cathedral called the Stiftskirche Domgemeinde Quedlinburg, promptly filed suit in Federal District Court in Dallas to recover the artworks. Letters Are Uncovered    In 1992, an out-of-court settlement between German officials and Lieutenant Meador's heirs led to the exhibition of the treasures at the Dallas Museum of Art that spring before they were returned to Germany. The next year they were exhibited before overflow crowds at the State Museum for Decorative Arts in Berlin, and last September they were finally returned to Quedlinburg.    The letters from the Quedlinburg thief to his family in Whitewright, Tex., a farm town 15 miles south of the Oklahoma border, were recently inspected by The New York Times.   They make clear that Lieutenant Meador, who studied art with his mother and taught art in the high school in New London, Tex., before entering the Army, recognized the unusual value of what he was stealing. When Lieutenant Meador's brother and sister were trying to sell the treasures after his death, they asserted that he had found them \\"in the gutter\\" and considered them of little value.   Current professional estimates of the value of the collection range from nearly $200 million to \\"priceless.\\"   The letters also demonstrate that the theft of the Quedlinburg treasures by Lieutenant Meador, who died of cancer in 1980, was not an isolated indiscretion by a war-weary soldier. He mentions having sent home two moving picture projectors, camera lenses, other optical instruments and clothing. Warning to Parents    Furthermore, he cautioned his parents not to show the treasures to anyone and later confessed that he had \\"appropriated\\" the artworks \\"from a cave in the mountains.\\"   The treasures had been kept for a millennium in the Schatzkammer, or treasure chamber, of the Quedlinburg cathedral. After Allied air attacks on Germany began, the treasures were moved to a cave outside of town.   Lieutenant Meador stole the treasures when his unit, the 87th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, was briefly stationed in Quedlinburg in the waning days of the fighting in Europe.   Apart from their physical beauty, the treasures have great historical importance to Germany because of their association with Heinrich I, a 10th-century Saxon ruler who united an early configuration of German-speaking states.   The most valuable item in the collection is the Samuhel Gospels, a sumptuously illustrated and illuminated ninth-century manuscript lettered with gold ink. It contains full-page paintings of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the four Gospel scribes, which are among the earliest and best-preserved examples of early Western painting.   The other treasures include a gold, silver and ivory casket from the ninth or 10th century, a biblical manuscript dated 1513 and emblazoned with gold, silver and jewels","excerpt":"a liturgical ivory comb dating to the seventh or eighth century; five fancifully shaped reliquaries of cut rock crystal dating to the 10th century and a heart-shaped vessel believed to have been fashioned in the 15th century. The Loot Declines    In a letter to his parents dated July 7, 1945, Lieutenant Meador said the second medieval manuscript he had sent home was bound in solid gold covers encrusted with nearly 80 jewels. \\"Please store it most carefully for me as it is very valuable,\\" he stated.   A week later, he wrote that he had sent home \\"a chest of the same type except the chest has a bunch of ivory inlay in it.\\"   By Aug. 2, 1945, he was bemoaning the scarcity of easily available \\"loot.\\"   \\"Now that the war is over it is harder to get things,\\" he complained.   The next December, Lieutenant Meador was court-martialed and fined $600 for the theft of valuable silverware and gold-decorated china from the villa of the Marquise of St. Carlos in Biarritz, France. Although the Army investigated the theft of the Quedlinburg treasures after the war, they were not traced to Lieutenant Meador at that time.   In the out-of-court settlement in 1992, Jack Meador and Jane Meador Cook, the siblings and heirs of Lieutenant Meador, received nearly $2.75 million from the German Government for relinquishing all claim to ownership of the artworks. The case has been investigated by the Internal Revenue Service, which, according to people close to the case who spoke on condition of anonymity, is now demanding $30 million in back taxes, interest and penalties from the Meadors.   \\"The I.R.S. is attempting to levy a tax and we expect to have to challenge it in tax court,\\" Randal Mathis, the Dallas lawyer who represents the Meadors, said last week.   In a book about the case published in Germany last week, Willi A. Korte, a German investigator, says he has evidence that two of the treasures are still unlawfully in the United States and held by persons other than the heirs.   He says he has sworn statements from people in the Dallas area who have been able to describe or recognize photographs of artworks long missing from Quedlinburg. These include a rock crystal flask in the shape of a bishop's cap and a gold reliquary in the form of a crucifix.

A celebration of the company-affiliated New Ballet School, the evening included a charming new piece by Eliot Feld for the school's advanced students. It was performed with impressive clarity, spirit and technical expertise. Most of all, this was a chance to see an ensemble at work whose racial mix was representative of the population of New York City, an extremely rare phenomenon in dance.   The school is devoted to the proposition that the experience of dancing ballet should be available to everyone. The students, who now number more than 1,200, are enrolled in the city's public schools and are accepted for training at the Feld studios by yearly auditions. Their classes and ballet clothes are free, and in a particularly ingenious arrangement, the students travel to the studios just north of Union Square by city school buses used earlier and later in the day to transport handicapped pupils.

Evelina Galang's stirring debut collection of stories, HER WILD AMERICAN SELF (Coffee House Press, paper, $12.95). Whether the person asking is a bystander at a bus stop, a school classmate wrinkling her nose at the smell of a box lunch of rice and fish, or a  film director known for his sleazy attitude toward Asian women, none are satisfied when the answer turns out to be Michigan, Wisconsin or New York. But if the ignorance and insensitivity of strangers is borne with graceful yet sarcastic humor, the pressures of home -- under the zealous gaze of parents eager for their daughters to partake of the \\"land of opportunity\\" -- yield a frustrated, rebellious sadness. In \\"Miss Teenage Sampaguita,\\" a visiting aunt observes her brother's tyrannical hold on her niece, who is expected to become a doctor and is deprived of everyday pleasures like the right to date or even talk on the telephone. And in \\"Talk to Me, Milagros,\\" a silent child watches as her lawyer father, recently arrived from the Philippines, is reduced to working as a busboy in a diner. While a number of Ms. Galang's stories lack a certain dynamic force, all are told in an elegant, mesmerizing style. The finest, \\"Filming Sausage,\\" is sharp with tension, while the brief, chantlike monologues that frame the collection are as lyrical as prayers.

What these characteristics are and which groups tend to possess them are still matters of speculation. Research in this area more often concerns large-scale disasters than everyday emergencies.
