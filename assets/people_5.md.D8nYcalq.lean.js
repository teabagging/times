Between 1960 and 1980, the consumption of table wine - the kind usually drunk with meals - increased more than sixfold.

New wineries were, it seemed, opening every other day, wine clubs were proliferating, and wine books were tumbling off the presses. Wine finally had become, to all intents and purposes, a respectable, even desirable part of the American scene.    Then, suddenly, the euphoria was gone. Wine consumption continued to increase, but the rate slowed to a snail's pace.

The design by the young French architect Dominique Perrault does indeed defy common sense. What kind of nutty idea is it to put books in high-rise towers and bury readers underground? Why bother to build four glass skyscrapers only to line them inside with rows of wooden shutters? And what can you say about the library's symbolic concept: four L-shaped towers, grouped around an open square like four immense open books?    But people go to libraries more for introspection than for panoramic city views.

Writing a whole album about people and places in Illinois, the second in a projected series of albums about all 50 states, threatens to be insufferably gimmicky. It's not. ''Sufjan Stevens invites you to: Come on feel the Illinoise'' (Asthmatic Kitty) creates a kind of psychohistory via Americana in songs that metamorphose from wistful to grand, from historical character study to private reminiscence, from banjo to orchestra, from minimalism to fuzz-toned rock. Even the most elaborate constructions come across as homemade, touched with an optimism that is by no means naïve.    Café Tacuba       The groundbreaking Mexican rock group Café Tacuba earned the screams and singalongs on its live album, ''Un Viaje'' (Universal Music Latino), with more than a decade's worth of smart, manic rock en Español. Ska, punk, the Beatles, electro, rapping, garage-rock, funk, whistling and all sorts of Mexican roots get crunched into Café Tacuba's catchy songs","excerpt":"so do poetry, rebellion and wit. Yet in the studio, and until recently onstage, Café Tacuba had built its songs on a drum machine. Lately, it has been rocking onstage with a human drummer, and that makes a difference. Now the songs can breathe.    Jaguar Wright       Now and then Jaguar Wright tries to make nice on her new album, ''Divorcing Neo 2 Marry Soul'' (Song/Artemis). She fitfully succeeds, as when she sums up the joys of true lust in ''So High.'' Yet with her tart, jazzy, highly mobile voice and her hard-nosed attitude, Ms. Wright is far better when she's confrontational. She warns a rival to stay away from her man -- ''woman to woman, you better have a good dental plan'' -- and advises a friend to dump a guy who beats her. In her songs she more than holds her own in a world of cheaters and hustlers. Despite the album's title, Ms. Wright hasn't wholly abandoned neo-soul; most of the album uses lean, modern, studio-built tracks. And then comes the 12-minute ''Do Your Worst'': an old-fashioned, string-laden, inexorable soul vamp that reacts to a man's betrayals with contempt, fury and vengeance.    Stephen Malkmus       ''All my stray thoughts, they are impure,'' Stephen Malkmus sings on ''Face the Truth'' (Matador), and he's putting it mildly. The unkempt sound and immodest ambition that Mr. Malkmus brought to Pavement -- and to a generation of 1990's indie-rockers -- have evolved further during his solo career. His new songs are a joyfully wayward melding of Pavement's lurching yet clear-cut melodies, jam-band instrumental passages, shards of garage-rock or funk, unruly analog synthesizers and lyrics full of philosophical aphorisms. ''Normal is weirder than you would care to admit,'' he sings, but how would he know?    Shannon McNally       She has the voice: bruised, smoky and ornery, right at home where country and soul meet. She has the melodies and the timing to stretch a phrase and let it snap back right where a word will cut deepest. On her second album, ''Geronimo'' (Back Porch), Ms. McNally also has superb roots-rock production from Charlie Sexton, the Texas guitarist and longtime sideman for Bob Dylan, that can be rollicking or resonant. Her lyrics sometimes lose focus, but when she homes in on a pithy chorus ''I never learned nothing but the hard way/ 'Cause at the time it felt so good'' -- she's irresistible.    Electrelane       Take a riff, expand it into a chord or two, repeat and crescendo and speed up until the big drone is everywhere. It's a simple strategy, but it still works for Electrelane on its third album, ''Axes'' (Too Pure), whether the band is circling through a keyboard pattern or flailing a guitar tremolo. Sometimes Verity Susman sings a few lines, or an entire borrowed song -- it's Leonard Cohen's ''Partisan'' -- amid the blare. Occasionally the momentum stops for some arty noise. Skip that, and head for the next big buildup.    Alarm Will Sound       Yesterday's avant-garde is today's dance-floor hook, as anyone can testify who's heard the sometimes minimal, sometimes atonal, sometimes melodic, sometimes cantankerous music of Richard D. James, or Aphex Twin. ''Acoustica'' (Cantaloupe) is an elaborately daft project by the chamber ensemble Alarm Will Sound, which transcribed Aphex Twin's sampled and computer-processed tracks for orchestral instruments played in real time. Tempering the beat -- a second drum kit would have been welcome -- and choosing meditative pieces as well as dance tracks, Alarm Will Sound retrofits Aphex Twin as a compeer of Steve Reich and Stravinsky. Some remixes bring back the digital edge, and they keep those unplugged instruments from sounding too primitive.

During the last 10 days, ''Taps,'' ''Four Friends,'' ''Buddy Buddy,'' ''Rollover,'' ''Pennies From Heaven,'' ''Ghost Story,'' ''Tales From the Vienna Woods,'' ''Neighbors'' and ''Heartbeeps'' have arrived in New York, closely followed by junketeering media folk from all over the country.   For example, 20th Century-Fox ran a weekend junket to New York to introduce Timothy Hutton, Academy Award winner for ''Ordinary People,'' to 200 out-of-town journalists. He saw them one at a time, and by the end of the first day, Mr. Hutton says, he had started wanting to invent elaborate stories ''because the 100th time somebody asks, 'How did you research the role?', you just wish you could say something to make it sound new.''   In ''Taps,'' the 21-year-old Mr. Hutton plays a military school cadet who has never questioned the authority of the general who runs the academy. In life, Mr. Hutton believes in asking questions. ''I think it's healthy.'' But, as he points out, ''I was a child of the 70's.'' His generation wasn't involved in confrontations over the draft, or the war in Vietnam.

A TASTE OF INDEPENDENCE"},{"year":"1978","title":"MARIE ST. CLAIR, the heroine of Charles Chaplin's radiantly beautiful \\"A Woman of Paris,\\" is, at the film's beginning, locked inside her bedroom by her foul-tempered father. That same evening, after she has escaped by climbing out a window, her father reverses the trick and locks her out. A year later, fate has whisked Marie away from her simple country home and off to \\"the magic city of Paris, where fortune is fickle and a woman gambles with life.\\" There, she is imprisoned, once again, but this time the cage is gilded and then some: Marie has become the expensively kept mistress of a very rich, very dapper, eternally bemused man. Almost obscenely wealthy by now, Marie isn't always happy, but she wasn't always happy as a simple country girl, either. Fate, as Mr. Chaplin understands it, works in endlessly ironic and enormously touching ways.The wisdom of \\"A Woman of Paris,\\" which was first released in 1923 but often feels as if it were made just yesterday, really does seem boundless","excerpt":"so do the affection and generosity with which Mr. Chaplin presents his characters. The film, described by an introductory note from Mr. Chaplin as \\"the first serious drama written and directed by myself,\\" has nothing of the Little Tramp about it, although the director does appear in a tiny cameo role as a railway porter. Consequently, it was a commercial failure in its day. After that, it stayed out of circulation for more than 50 years, until Mr. Chaplin prepared a new score and allowed the film to be screened at the Museum of Modern Art two years ago. Since then, the film has had the reputation of a lost masterpiece, and it more than lives up to its renown.The tale of a pampered woman who learns the hard way to value simplicity and honesty may not seem like big news, but Mr. Chaplin used that premise to string together an uninterrupted series of perfect vignettes. One of the best of these involves Marie (Edna Purviance), her lover Pierre Revel (Adolphe Menjou) and some pearls he long ago bestowed upon his mistress. Marie defiantly tells Pierre that she is leaving him to marry her provincial sweetheart, because all she really wants from life are a few children and the love of a good man. To prove her point, she rips off the necklace and flings it out a window. But when she looks out to find a hobo discovering the jewels, she races into the street and grabs them back. She is followed by a little dog, which appears just long enough to suggest a certain side of Marie's nature and is never seen again.Although \\"A Woman of Paris,\\" which opens today at the Cinema Studio, is a drama in many respects, it is at times extremely funny; Mr. Chaplin gets some wonderfully witty milage out of the incongruity of upper-class pretensions and the bestial side of anyone's nature. The film's most dazzling sustained sequence takes place in a posh restaurant, where Marie and Pierre dine elegantly on champagne and truffles. As a title explains, \\"Note: truffles rooted up from the soil by hogs—a delicacy for pigs and gentlemen.\\" The moment is wry, but not satirical, thanks both to Mr. Chaplin's complex sympathies and the enormously alluring performances of Miss Purviance and Mr. Menjou, Mr. Chaplin never forgets that the most effective way of sending up a life of ease involves exaggerating, not deflating, its sense of easiness.The stirring tableau that ends the film's Parisian segment ideally exemplifies Mr. Chaplin's care, compassion and economy. Marie, having re-encountered her country lover after she began putting on airs, commissioned him to paint her portrait in an elegant white gown. Instead, he chose to depict her in a simple, dark dress he remembered her wearing before.Long after the portrait is completed, Marie happens to be wearing the white outfit on a night that ends in tragedy, and destiny leads her to a spot directly beneath the dark portrait, where she weeps so honestly that an enemy is moved to spare her life. Nothing could be less melodramatic than the manner in which Mr. Chaplin presents this small epiphany. And nothing could be more rich with the eternal promise of redemption.

Then Bob comes along, and it is pretty obvious he is the nicer person of the two. That is, of the two men; Lyla is in a class by herself.After a time, the house owner comes around and threatens eviction unless the rent is paid. Two hundred dollars is necessary, so Bob goes out and earns part by gambling; Joe, the rest by gunning. The \\"cops\\"—they call them \\"cops\\" on Tenth Avenue—and Bob is arrested for murder, robbery and other things. Joe, who has committed a long list of crimes, finally is killed as he tries to escape.Of the participants, Victor Varconi as Bob gives the most coherent portrayal. Joseph Schildkraut as Joe at times fails to resemble the gunman that he is supposed to be. Phyllis Haver is decidedly emotional and makes unnecessary gestures.

Mexico knows no greater wrath than that of its president when his dignity - or that of his country - is compromised. By leaning too heavily on Mexico on drug-related matters, the United States is risking a drastic Mexican response.   United States public opinion and the American Government have a valid point: Mexican exports of drugs are on the rise, and Mexico is, at least theoretically, in danger of becoming another Colombia or Thailand.

When we use the modern concert format as a reliquary -- as most concert givers have decided to do -- we hit snags like this. Much of this music's truth  is irrevocably lost when we put it inside a theater and in front of an audience.

Its latter sequences are quite good, although some of the farcical episodes are too prolonged.\\"Le Bal\\" was directed by William Thiele, who apparently is not especially concerned about the quality of the photography, for some of the scenes are poorly lighted and at times the tops of the heads of the players are almost out of the frame. Also M. Thiele fails to give the spectator a clear conception of the lapses of time. The family with which this pictorial story is concerned appears to leap from a humble home to vast wealth over night. It is revealed that the supposedly valueless bonds bequeathed Alfred and Jeanne are suddenly found to be worth a king's ransom, but how this husband and wife, with their daughter Antoinette, suddenly acquire a palatial dwelling in the French capital, is left to the imagination.Once Alfred and Jeanne have cashed the securities, they go forth to enjoy their money. They go to the races, where Alfred encounters Marcel de Brecourt, who gives the nouveau riche a tip on a horse, which wins. They are invited to de Brecourt's home, and the host flirts with Jeanne, who is flattered by his attentions. Alfred and Jeanne have their spats, but finally they decide to give a dance, and the élite of Paris are invited.The night of nights arrives","excerpt":"so does the orchestra. Uniformed lackeys in knickerbockers march into the ball-room in squadrons and chefs are kept busy preparing the repast. Alfred and Jeanne hope to startle everybody. They enter the room just before 10 o'clock, the hour mentioned on the invitations. When it is half past ten, the host and hostess are uneasy, but suddenly their faces brighten up on hearing that the first guest has arrived. It chances to be Aunt Isabelle, a droll old woman who gives music lessons to Antionette. Later, Alfred and Jeanne and the somewhat inebriated Aunt Isabelle ask the musicians and the lackeys at what hour society people arrive usually at such an affair.Alfred and Jeanne subsequently decide that they have been given the cold shoulder by their guests, but they make the best of their party. Little Antoinette alone knows why the guests did not appear.During the unfurling of this tale several songs are sung, one of which is \\"C'est le dimanche.\\" M. Lefaur is worthy of a better picture, for he gives an excellent portrayal of Alfred. Germaine Dermoz is satisfactory as Jeanne. Mlle.

And though the lights do shine brightly for the fabulous here, the back streets of this gritty pocket of Los Angeles hold hidden gems for the everyman. Wander a recently dolled-up stretch of Hollywood Boulevard and cut into side streets that lead to unexpected pleasures. Discover restaurants stylish enough to make West Hollywood blush, or head to the rising hills and discover Hollywood's most becoming angles. Try something wacky -- don't even look at Mann's Chinese Theater. Hollywood is on the rise again, and the granddaddy of glamour and glitz has never looked better.   CINDY PRICE    Friday    5 p.m.  1 -- Quiet on the Set    Tucked into the last curve of a residential street in the Hollywood Hills, where Weidlake Drive dead-ends, a plain white sign marks an entrance. Open the gate, make a hard left, and you will stumble on the striking landscape of the Hollywood Reservoir. From this spot at the Mulholland Dam, you can take in sweeping views of the deep blue reservoir, the rolling mansion-lined hills and the legendary Hollywood sign. The reservoir was built in the early 1920's by William Mulholland to try to ease Los Angeles's water shortages, but the history doesn't end there. That enormous pinkish-orange house on the hill to the right of the sign was Bugsy Siegel's and later belonged to Madonna. ''Chinatown'' was filmed here.

And along the stretch of Hollywood Boulevard between Bronson and Normandie Avenues there is no shortage of Thai restaurants -- but only one has a Thai Elvis impersonator. At Palms Thai Restaurant (5900 Hollywood Boulevard, 323-462-5073), locals knock elbows over steaming noodles to tunes courtesy of a man they call the Thai Elvis. He's Kavee Thongpricha (you can call him Kevin), and he punches in on Friday and Saturday nights at 7:30 sharp. Culinary nerds will want to head straight to the back of the menu. Listed under Wild Things are peppery, garlicky frogs' legs ($15.99) and crispy fish maw -- fried air bladder -- salad ($7.99).    10 p.m.  3 -- Heels on the Bar    There's plenty of scene to be found in the Hollywood night, which is exactly why Birds Cafe (5925 Franklin Avenue, 323-465-0175), a rotisserie chicken-cum-local watering hole, sounds so much better once 10 o'clock rolls around. Sitting on a leafy block of Franklin Avenue, Birds fills up late with spillover from the Upright Citizen Brigade Theater (5919 Franklin Avenue, 323-908-8702; www.ucbtheatre.com/la) next door and 20-somethings unwilling to cough up the gas money to go to the nearby Silver Lake neighborhood. Slip into an oversize leather booth for a couple of pints or grab a table on the patio and watch the passing hipsters -- or, as one regular calls them, Charlie Browns. Word has it that if you stay late enough, you may be pulled onto the bar to dance.    Saturday    11 a.m.  4 -- The Egg Man    Right next to the looming presence of a Church of Scientology building, you'll find the charming Square One Dining (4854 Fountain Avenue, 323-661-1109), a three-month-old restaurant that serves a fantastic breakfast all day. Though the menu has more complex offerings, Philip Fox, the owner, prides himself on directing rookies to the straightforward egg dishes to showcase his farm fresh, and often organic, ingredients. ''The eggs we'll serve next week are in the chicken today,'' he swears.    1 p.m.  5 -- Easy, Trigger    You are welcome to head out on foot through Griffith Park for a distant glimpse of those famous nine letters, but nobody walks in Los Angeles. Opt for a horseback ride at the Sunset Ranch (3400 North Beachwood Drive, 323-469-5450; www.sunsetranchhollywood.com), Hollywood's last dude ranch. The guided one-hour trip ($25) wanders along canyon edges to allow for stunning views of the park, the Bronson Caves and the inescapable sign. But the horses are gentle, and the guides confident and funny as they punch up the trip with bits of history and legend -- and all the gray areas between.    3 p.m.  6 -- Toxins Out    Ever wonder what West Coasters are going on about with all their sage oils and chakras? Lord knows, but it's high time someone found out. Celebrities and laymen alike flock to Golden Bridge Yoga (6322 De Longpre Avenue, 323-936-4172; www.goldenbridgeyoga.com) for classes, but it's still easy to book a massage at its recent addition, the Amrit Davaa Wellness Center. It offers almost a dozen different treatments, but if you closed down Birds Cafe the night before, it's best to book Hari Narayan. In just over an hour, Ms. Narayan's raindrop-technique massage ($90) pledges to detoxify you physically -- and mentally.    5 p.m.  7 -- Fat of the Land    All right, wheat-grass warrior. Let's get some chili dogs into you before you pass out from clean living. The venerable Pink's still reigns with the fanny-pack set, but Skooby's Hot Dogs (6654 Hollywood Boulevard, 323-468-3647), above, a relative newcomer, has some frankfurter connoisseurs saying it surpasses Pink's. After eating your fill, follow the trail of Hollywood stars and take a left at La Brea. Two Iranian brothers do ice cream with panache at Mashti Malone's (1525 North La Brea Avenue, 323-874-6168), a Hollywood haunt seriously dedicated to uncanny flavors. Celebrities order in bulk, craving Mashti's concoctions of rosewater saffron, or faludeh, a rice-starch sorbet. Dig into a bowl of full-fat orange blossom, and watch the parade of Size 0's file past. Ah, to be young, happy and not looking for an acting job.    7 p.m.  8 -- Chiller Theater    If the weather is good, snag a bottle of wine and head over to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery (6000 Santa Monica Boulevard, 323-469-1181; www.hollywoodforever.com). Every Saturday night in the summer, a kinetic crowd descends on the lawn for Cinespia's (www.cinespia.org) film screenings. The creepy magic here is undeniable: the palms swaying against the velvet sky, the safety-in-numbers spookiness of walking among the graves, the crystal-clear screenings of classics like ''The Maltese Falcon'' or ''The Birds.'' Doors open at 6:30 for the 8:30 show, and the lawn fills up fast.    11 p.m.  9 -- Bowery West    Hollywood is suddenly awash in so many trendy late-night restaurants, you'd think you'd died and gone to Manhattan. Speaking of which, right next door to the hipper-than-thou Magnolia on Sunset Boulevard, is the Bowery (6268 Sunset Boulevard, 323-465-3400), a discreet little joint fitted out to replicate a New York bar. Check out the tin ceilings, which the owner, George Abou-Daoud, notes were shipped in from Williamsburg in Brooklyn. The burger ($9) is top-notch, but more important, how is the Manhattan at the Bowery? Served over rocks on a hot summer night, it's just a touch sweet. But hey, so is the service.    Sunday    10:30 a.m.  10 -- After the Big Sleep    Are you tired of being fabulous yet? Even superstars need a day of rest, and so the City of Angels declared: Let there be brunch. Off Vine (6263 Leland Way, 323-962-1900), above, might be the prettiest little restaurant in Hollywood, mostly because it doesn't feel Hollywood at all. Tucked away in a bright, century-old bungalow and surrounded by flowers, Off Vine's large garden patio is the kind of place that persuades you to linger over Bloody Marys ($7) and eggs Benedict ($10.95) all day. And you know what? This is Hollywood, kid. You go right ahead.    THE BASICS    A New Shine On Old Tinsel       Besides Los Angeles International, there are several smaller airports near Hollywood, including ones in Long Beach, Burbank and Ontario, that are used by low-cost airlines including JetBlue and Southwest. Check www.sidestep.com for a comparison of prices.     In a pinch, anyone can find a room in Hollywood -- Super 8's and Holiday Inns abound. If you book ahead, though, there is also some nice midrange lodging.     The Hollywood Roosevelt (7000 Hollywood Boulevard, 323-466-7000; www.hollywoodroosevelt.com) was recently overhauled. Weekend rates start at $189. From the dim lobby to the minimalist rooms, the hotel has a young, urban feel. A stroll down to the über-trendy pool will have you dropping your jaw at the scene or giggling -- depending on your sensibility. Either way, welcome to Los Angeles.     Just a couple of blocks away, the Magic Castle Hotel (7025 Franklin Avenue, 323-851-0800; www.magiccastlehotel.com) starts at $169 a night and has a near-perfect track record among the quarrelsome users of TripAdvisor (www.tripadvisor.com). Situated just off the touristy section, this boutique hotel has a residential feel; in fact, the pool area bears an uncanny resemblance to the set of ''Melrose Place.'' 36 Hours in Hollywood"},{"year":"2008","title":"I’m trying to get my own thoughts on the oil stuff clear","excerpt":"so for the econowonks, a tiny theoretical paper for your enjoyment and/or detestation.

His lungs are holes in his body, which open and close. And inside the holes are stiffened membranes, arranged like the pages of a book -- imagine that! And when the holes open, the pages rise up and unfold, and the blood that circles through them touches the air, and by this bath of air the blood is made pure . . .

These are excellent attributes in a picture which otherwise is not distinguished. \\"The Outriders\\" follows a conventional storyline of adventure in the days of wagon trains and marauding Indians, but it comes off with neatness and dispatch and succeeds in generating some lively interest now and again.Joel McCrea, Barry Sullivan and James Whitmore do very nicely as a trio of Confederate soldiers who escape from a Union prison camp in the closing days of the Civil War and take up with Quantrill's Raiders. They head south to Santa Fe to join a wagon train carting $1,000,000 in gold to Richmond and are supposed to lead the party into an ambush. McCrea and Whitmore take on the distasteful assignment because the gold will help the Confederate cause, but Sullivan knows that Quantrill's interest is less altruistic and that, indeed, this is to be robbery pure and simple.The ride north drags at times but it never gets dull, for the scenery is magnificent, Indians come riding down the hillside to bite the dust, the muleskinners grow rebellious under the constant drudgery of much work and little rest and McCrea and Sullivan both desire the favor of an attractive widow making the journey. There are a lot of little things happening all the time which keep the screen alive and the sequences showing the party forging a rampaging river is a humdinger.Under Roy Rowland's direction all the elements of a good Western—suspense, action, romance and inspiring photography—are evident in \\"The Outriders.\\" And it has that all important bang-up climax, too, when McCrea learns the war is over and attempts to lead the party out of the ambush.

Claude Jarman Jr. has a small role which he performs competently and Ramon Novarre is excellent as the Mexican businessman who owns the wagon train and all its wealth.

A more serene little comedy would be hard to find and possibly would not be worth the bother, for its charm arises principally from its rarity. Mellowness is unusual to the screen","excerpt":"so is a dramatist's trick of muffling all his alarms. Mr. Hay has written in sentimental mood. We hesitate to shatter it even by too hearty applause.He was writing, as you may remember from the play, of an English public school, ivy-grown and moss-covered, and of some of the moss-backs on its faculty. The one he liked was Charles Donkin who knew what was going on in the minds of his boys even when he was applying a cane to their never-minds. The one he disliked was Dr. Ovington, the new headmaster with an astonishing talent for doing all the wrong things. He placed the regatta out of bounds; he insisted that the third class boys wear their caps on their foreheads instead of well back; horrible injustices like that. So mutiny threatened, and to make things worse (or better), three pert misses and their dreadnaught of an aunt descended upon the school to take up residence with the harried Mr. Donkin. Truly a time of plague.The comedy is at its best when it is not trying to be a comedy. When it does, it grows skittish or ponderous, giggles or haw-haws. Humor suits it better and, fortunately, humor predominates, even when it is merely the unconsciously-humorous portrait of the English school boy and his masters wearing the stiff upper lip. The picture has caught this phase of the British scene remarkably well, so well that we were as annoyed as the headmaster at the feminine intrusion upon a scene, and a plot, that could have been worked out just as easily without them.The performances are good generally, particularly so in the cases of Otto Kruger's characterization of that old faculty pillar, Mr. Donkin, and of Knyaston Reeves's thin-lipped portrayal of the academic ogre, Dr. Ovington. Amusing bits have been contributed by Walter Hudd, John Wood, Cecil Parker and Michael Shepley. The same, unhappily, cannot be said of Rosamund Barnes, who is really too big to be imitating Jane Withers. Still the general effect of the film is pleasant. It is entertaining in a quiet way.

This novel is the author's 12th about Goldy and her Goldilocks' Catering company, and the fifth in this tepid, microwaveable series to make the Times hardcover list.

Dwight Garner   Inside the List"},{"year":"1983","title":"GENUINE fairy tales are rare","excerpt":"so is film-making that is thoroughly original in an unobtrusive way. Bill Forsyth's quirky disarming ''Local Hero'' is both, and it's also proof that Mr. Forsyth's other feature film released here, ''Gregory's Girl,'' was more than a happy accident. The Glasgow-born Mr. Forsyth has put Scottish comedy on the map, for whatever that's worth. He has also developed a dryly whimsical style, very close to a deadpan at times, that allows the strangest events or personages to glide by almost unnoticed. ''Local Hero'' contains a mermaid, an enchanted village and a possibly magical rabbit. No undue fuss is made about any one of them.    ''Local Hero,'' which opens today at Cinema 1, doesn't begin on a very promising note. It starts in Houston, a place toward which Mr. Forsyth, who wrote and directed the film, has no outstandingly fresh attitude. The tale begins at the headquarters of gigantic Knox Oil, where it is learned - at a meeting in which everyone present has to whisper, because Felix Happer (Burt Lancaster), the board chairman, is snoozing - that the company plans to replace a charming little Scottish fishing village, called Ferness, with an oil refinery.   A Knox employee called Mac MacIntyre (Peter Riegert) is delegated to fly to Ferness to buy the place, and he is chosen because his name makes it sounds as if he's well suited to the chore. MacIntyre isn't a Scot; he's the son of Hungarian immigrants who thought MacIntyre was a Hungarian name. That makes about as much sense as anything else that goes on here.    Once MacIntyre arrives in Scotland, odd things start to happen - nothing dramatic, nothing you can put your finger on, but undeniably strange. He and a traveling companion, a young Scottish employee of Knox named Danny Oldsen (Peter Capaldi), are en route to Ferness when their car hits a rabbit in a heavy fog. They stop the car in the middle of the road and sleep inside. The next morning, the fog is gone, the rabbit is sitting in the back seat, and the travelers are ready to proceed. But something indefinable has changed. It's as though they have entered into a dream.    Certainly the postcard-perfect town of Ferness has its delightfully dreamlike qualities. Every time Mac and Danny venture out of their inn, the same motorcylist barrels by and nearly runs them down. The inn itself is managed by Gordon Urquhart (Denis Lawson), who also functions as the accountant next door, and who has a different personality to suit each job. (The accountant is unctuous, the innkeeper vaguely rude.) There is an omnipresent baby whose parents are never identified; a black African minister named Macpherson with an all-white congregation; a lone punk-rock groupie with a red-blue-and-green teased hairdo; and two beautiful women who probably function as muses, named Stella and Marina (Jennifer Black and Jenny Seagrove). Marina swims with exceptional grace. She has, as Danny notices but doesn't mention when he kisses her knee one afternoon, webbed feet.    Ferness casts its spell over Mac, who arrives there jealously guarding his battery-powered briefcase, and eventually becomes one of the place's more relaxed denizens. It ought to have a similar effect on the audience, and seduce the viewer just as gradually. The charm and humor of ''Local Hero'' are so very understated that they may seem elusive at first, but they are undeniably powerful.    The less Mr. Forsyth explains, the more appealingly odd the movie seems, and it manages to be open-ended but not annoyingly cryptic. Besides, even the occasional bits of information about the townspeople aren't very helpful. The more you find out about Ferness - why, say, the entire population of the village is seen sneaking out of the church as MacIntyre, who has come to buy the church, momentarily turns his back - the less you know.    The best thing that Mr. Forsyth does with actors is to induce them to behave as though nothing would surprise them. Everyone here has that air, particularly Mr. Riegert. His performance, which begins as a send-up of young corporate hotshots' demeanor, winds up as that of the movie's straightest straight man, the one who'll barely blink when someone else squirts lemon in his eye. Mr. Lancaster is less steadily present, appearing mostly at the film's beginning and at its end, but he brings with him sufficient authority when, say, he descends on Ferness out of the skies (via helicopter) and immediately begins ordering everyone around. Of course, Ferness isn't the sort of place where anyone takes orders terribly seriously.    ''Local Hero'' is a funny movie, but it's more apt to induce chuckles than knee-slapping. Like ''Gregory's Girl,'' it demonstrates Mr. Forsyth's uncanny ability for making an audience sense that something magical is going on, even if that something isn't easily explained.    ''Local Hero'' is rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''). It contains some sexually suggestive scenes.

It is followed by a brief film, \\"Attore Cinematografico\\" (Cinema Actor), which proved an excellent vehicle in which Farfariello (Cav. E. Migliaccio), a favorite of the local Italian colony, gives a series of impersonations with laughter-provoking songs and dialogue. For years he has been known here as \\"il re del macchiettisti\\" (the king of the impressionists).What lifts \\"Amore e Morte\\" (Love and Death) above the commonplace are the realization of a curse cast on the de Agro' family which brings a violent death to a philandering rustic and to the peasant's daughter he had captivated, and insanity to her father, the unfolding of the drama in an environment unfamiliar to New Yorkers and a psychology of interpretation equally unusual here.A location in a difficultly cultivated region of New Jersey, within sight of the Watchung Mountain, with stone house and isolated barn, with orchard and grape trellises, provides a striking illusion of the approaches to Etna in Eastern Sicily. This illusion is further emphasized by a \\"carretto siciliano,\\" the high, two-wheel cart with pictured side-boards, drawn by a plumed horse and overloaded with a dozen merry-makers and by the docile but obstinate donkey, the \\"asinetto,\\" which is peculiarly Sicilian. The costumes of the farmhands and their implements contribute to the illusion, which finds expansive expression in the \\"festa di raccolta\\" and the songs and dances there, which, with a thunderstorm, serve as a foil to the climax of the tragedy.A prevailing contribution to the illusion is the dialogue in Sicilian, with occasional Italian phrases and Italo-American expressions.This Sicilian and its inseparable gestures are convincingly transmitted to the audience by adequate microphonic and photographic apparatus. Several of those thus heard and seen are familiar to the audience of Commander Giuseppe Sterni's Teatro d'Arte. Their diction left little to be desired.The whole film is remarkably striking and convincing, with the high lights reached by the \\"festa\\" and the storm, where a bolt of lightning saves the \\"padrone\\" from slaying his daughter's betrayer. On the other hand, the agony of the daughter's confession and of the arrest of her betrayer's wife, who stole to keep her babes from starving, is a trifle prolix, even though accomplished by a couple of sympathetic carabinieri in full dress uniform. Unnecessary is the appearance of the begging nuns.The Barbara and Ruggiero of the Romeos are clear-cut, distinct impersonations","excerpt":"so is the \\"soprantendente\\" of the veteran actor, Bongini. The betrayed Chiara of Miss Diana is realistic without being impressive—the magnifying of the natural, so necessary to the film, is not there.Statistics show that New York has the greatest Italian population of any city in the world. The number of Sicilians in it is not known. From either category the initial view of \\"Amore e Morte\\" did not seem to have adequate representation.

As for plot, there's sinewy Sindbad (Guy Williams) trying to rescue a dead pan princess (Heidi Bruhl) from a wicked ruler (Pedro Armendariz), aided by a tippling, belching old magician.Throw in a tired \\"Scheherazade\\"-type of score, as Mr. Williams braves anything from crocodiles to a 12-headed monster (our count, anyway), and you have the kind of harmless trash some kids may tolerate.Yesterday, a cute little blonde in front of us took it all in stride, monsters included.

At the outset, a leathery engineer played by Lloyd Bochner, representing progress, clashes with a stubborn old native \\"protector,\\" Torin Thatcher.This text soon becomes a footnote to a romance, as evil slave traders provide a melodramatic finish. The young singer, Frankie Avalon, tags along on the safari trail, which isn't helped by a hollow jazz-like score.The most original thing about this slipshod, small-scale survey of Africa is a marvelous symbolical bit showing a wounded, drowning elephant. This sandwiched-in footage is passed right over, in short shrift. So, for the most part, is the significance of an alert actor named Hari Rhodes, as a nimble-minded native.Add, finally, to those piercing color backgrounds, the natural, unaffected performance of pretty Mariette Hartley, as a medical worker. Now a grown woman and a gifted one, Miss Hartley first appeared in that grand Randolph Scott-Joel McCrea Western, \\"Ride the High Country,\\" as the most appealing ingénue in years.

So zestfully does Mr. Vidal contradict himself in his practice as a writer, one is not surprised to read, as long ago as 1967, that he has all but given up on prose fiction (''three centuries is quite long enough for any literary form'') while being told that he is at work on a ''chronicle'' of novels dealing with American history.

And Signor Racca never overacts, nor does he indulge too much in supposed Napoleonic postures and gestures.Among other members of the cast whose characterizations deserve high praise are Pino Locchi, who makes the little King of Rome credible, although Master Locchi hardly can pass for a 4-year-old boy; Enzo Biliotti, as Fouché, the most notorious double-crossing politician in French history, and Emilia Varini, in the rôle of Napoleon's mother. Rosa Stradner, who also played Marie Louise in the German version, is pretty and competent.As was prophesied by European theatre critics when the joint work of Premier Mussolini and Giovacchino Forzano made its stage début in 1932, the film apparently is far superior to the play. Naturally, this is largely due to the greater resources of the screen, as shown in such striking scenes as the landing near Cannes and the Battle of Waterloo.From the propaganda angle it was to be expected that the futility of the so-called Chamber of Deputies hastily elected to make Napoleon a \\"constitutional monarch\\" would be exploited.

For example, \\"The Easy Road,\\" which was at the Rialto last week, cannot be recommended as entertainment, for it runs about an hour and a quarter and affords only fifteen, maybe ten, minutes of genuine pleasure to the lover of kinetic photography. But those few minutes would be worth while if they could be taken by themselves.They include, for instance, a scene in which the hero (Thomas Meighan) is trying to write. His powers of concentration are weak and a dog's barking outside his room, the purring of a nearby cat, the falling of a log to the fireplace and other slight sounds distract his thoughts. These disturbances, with their effect on the man at the desk, are tellingly pictured by the process of cutting from the man to one of the sources of noise and back to the man, each picture taking its ordered turn in showing what is happening. No word is needed and none is used. In the case of the cat a little suggestion is necessary, though, for a feline purr has no chemical effect on film","excerpt":"so one picture shows the cat asleep in a chair and the next is of kettle of boiling water with vigorous steam escaping from the spout and top. Then the man's annoyed look at the cat, which follows immediately, needs no exegetic comment—and, thank heaven, none is forced upon it.There is nothing startling about this. It is a simple, even obvious, way of treating the subject, but it is a cinematographic way, and therefore worth noting. This may be appreciated the more if it is realized that some directors, wishing to represent the purring of a cat disturbing a man, would show a picture of the cat, then one of the man registering impatience, and then some such subtile as, \\"Damn that cat's purring.\\"\\"The Easy Road\\" was directed by Tom Forman, who, until last year, was recorded as an actor rather than as a director. The present writer missed \\"The Ladder of Lies\\" and \\"Sins of Rosanne,\\" the two pictures directed by him which came to Broadway in 1920, and so does not know what they contained, but it appears from \\"The Easy Road\\" that Mr. Forman, though not an entirely satisfying director, at least has something of the cinematographic idea, and, if this is so, good works should come from him in the future. It may be, however, that it is not Mr. Forman who has the idea, but Beulah Marie Dix, who wrote the scenario for \\"The Easy Road.\\" It is often impossible to tell just who is responsible for any particular bit in a photoplay.CONCERNING the picture in question, it is a pleasure to record further that Lila Lee gives an excellent characterization of a pathetic little street waif in it. Miss Lee, as has been remarked before, came into motion pictures from vaudeville with a certain reputation as \\"Cuddles,\\" and for some time had nothing but this reputation to recommend her. She seemed unable to grasp the fundamentals of screen acting. Perhaps she was too camera conscious; maybe her directors did not know how to bring her out. At any rate, announced as a star of the first magnitude, she failed to reveal any brilliance and the ambitious program mapped out for her was soon abandoned. Then she began to appear in relatively minor rôles without at first attracting attention by noticeably poor or remarkably good work, until she suddenly drew the spotlight to herself in William De Mille's \\"Midsummer Madness.\\" Apparently she had discovered the knack of acting before the camera. Her work in \\"The Easy Road\\" indicates that her earlier impersonation was no accident, for her rôles in the two photoplays are decidedly different and equally well done. Miss Lee seems to be coming on.THE SAPHEAD,\\" which was at the Capitol last week, is nothing to be taken literally. Not even the most credulous of spectators could accept as plausible some if its incidents, and its most conspicuous figure, Bertie Van Alstyne, would not be allowed at large in any community. As a photoplay, pretending to tell a logical story, it is simply not worth considering.But the writer thoroughly enjoyed Buster Keaton's Bertie. He did not give the character human identity, but he was a most entertaining clown—and a clown is as welcome as any one else if his clowning is workmanlike. Buffoonery should have a place in the sun, and he who would drive it out of the world might make men wiser—though this is doubtful—but he would certainly make them sadder. The only legitimate demand is that buffoonery shall be genuinely humorous, born of wit and skill and a discerning sense of the ridiculous, not depending for its laughs on vulgarity, coarseness, the crude repetition of over-done situations, or mechanical resort to oft-exposed tricks. And, of course, the buffoon must have personality, animal magnetism, or whatever you call it, and some ability at expression.In the writer's opinion the farcical scenes in \\"The Saphead\\" meet the requirements for buffoonery. They are among the richest of their kind that he has to be grateful for. Take, for example, the scene on the floor of the Stock Exchange. Could anything be more improbable—or funnier? Brokers neglect the business of trading to haze a new member; they pin a sign on him, knock his hat off repeatedly, and muss him up generally. They seem altogether like freshmen on a lark. And what could be more refreshing than this sight of the normal pandemonium of the Stock Exchange turned into the pandemonium of the schoolboy rough house? One might say, if he felt like it, that there was as much sense to the one as to the other. And so might horseplay give the philosopher a text.But it may be said that such burlesque has no place in a photoplay that obviously takes itself seriously, to which it may be replied that such a photoplay taking itself seriously has no place in such burlesque. Let's keep the burlesque. Away with the photoplay. It's only the usual dull stuff, and without Keaton and his comedy would be uninterruptedly tiresome. \\"The Saphead\\" is a badly constructed photoplay, of course, with its jumping back and forth between self-styled serious comedy and extravagant farce. And for this reason it is annoying to some, and would be to the writer if its farce were not so good. When he saw the picture he simply ignored its every pretension to verisimilitude, and sa tback and laughed at Buster Keaton's finished clowning. Leave only this clowning in the picture, with just enough of the stupid old plot to give it coherence, and you'd have one of the best broad comedies the screen could show.

Big Deal."},{"year":"1926","title":"Contrasting phases of existence are depicted in an exaggerated fashion in \\"Risky Business,\\" the second film feature from Cecil B. De Mille's studio to be presented at the Hippodrome. The attractive and well-meaning heroine, Cecily Stoughton, is called upon in this tale to choose between love in a cottage and revelry in a mansion, and as the disagreeable features of both places are emphasized, it is not surprising that the poor girl at first does not know which way to turn.The humble suitor is a good-looking country doctor, who lives with his sister and brother-in-law. There are two persistent children who demand constant entertainment, and to inject a little comedy there is also a Swedish maid, who has paid but scant attention to her increasing weight. She is just as apt to cause the stairs to give way as she is to break the furniture, which brings this pictorial effort occasionally dangerously near to slapstick comedy.The idea is based upon Charles Brackett's story, \\"Pearls Before Cecily,\\" and so far as the performances of the principals are concerned, it is carried out fairly well. It is weakened, however, by the clumsy way in which the narrative is unfurled and also by an impulsive title-writer, who terms a physician a \\"pill-slinger\\" and tells of a woman \\"parking her troubles with her brother.\\"Cecily's mother wants her daughter to become the wife of Coults-Browne, a young man of means, and Mr. Coults-Browne is himself enthusiastic about the idea. He and Mrs. Stoughton decide to permit Cecily to see for herself how she would like being the wife of a small-town physician by taking her on a visit to Dr. Ted Pyncheon's home. Cecily discovers that Dr. Pyncheon has to be absent at all hours on calls and that his sister is always busy with her two children. Hence, after a brief stay in that home, she accepts Coults-Browne's invitation to go to his country estate. On the way there, however, Coults-Browne, through careless driving, injures a little boy, and the conscienceless motorist does not tarry to ascertain whether the child, is badly hurt. In the elaborately furnished house Cecily observes that the activities of the guests are confined to kissing, cocktail drinking and dancing the Charleston","excerpt":"so she finally flees from the place.The boy who had been injured in the automobile serves to bring Cecily and the young doctor together. Hence, love in the cottage gets its way.Vera Reynolds impersonates Cecily and while she does quite well with the part, she is so overdressed that when she first visits Dr. Pyncheon she looks like a circus queen or a professional skater. Kenneth Thomson is ingratiating as the young doctor, and Ward Crane, who is an adept at portraying smooth villainy, is acceptable, but a little too demonstrative, as Coults-Browne. Ethel Clayton is capital as Mrs. Stoughton, and so is Zasu Pitts as Dr. Pyncheon's sister.This picture is about one-third of the Hippodrome program, which includes several vaudeville acts, some fair and others not so good. THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1933","title":"With its excellent acting by an imposing list of players and the meticulous attention to details of flying, both on land and in the air, the film translation of the prize novel, \\"Night Flight,\\" written by the French air-mail pilot, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, is a vivid and engrossing production. This feature, which is at the Capitol, also has the unique advantage of a drama that happens within twenty-four hours.The stage is set in South America, in Buenos Aires and other places, and the narrative tells of the supposed first night flights in that section of the world. Its human moments are contrasted with the rigid discipline exerted by Riviere, the managing director of the company running the mail planes. There are thrilling glimpses of an airplane battling its way through fog and others revealing a machine blown out to sea during an electrical storm. According to the wife of one pilot, flying in the dark is risking the lives of pilots just to give somebody in Paris the satisfaction of receiving a post on Tuesday instead of Thursday. Even Daudet, the president of the company, fails to influence the iron-willed Riviere. No matter what the weather, Riviere orders the planes to take off for their respective points, and it happens that one of the machines is bearing not merely letters, but much-desired serum to save lives.It is probably the most authentic flying story that has come to the screen. The glimpses of the pilots in the planes sending messages to the radio control room on an aviation field and then the reception of the messages, are most effective. It has well-balanced scenes and strong suspense. You see two men in an airplane, that has fuel for only one-half hour, being blown out to sea sending the information to those on land. Then there is a wife of the pilot awaiting her husband for dinner. She tries dining alone, but the idea of her husband being overdue is too much for her nerves","excerpt":"so she goes to the company's headquarters, after calling up Riviere on the telephone.One light-hearted pilot arrives on the field still clad in his dinner jacket, and he quickly dons his flying togs over the evening clothes. Lights on a huge map of South America give Riviere the information concerning the progress of the different airplanes. Many of the scenes are revealed by expert and imaginative methods. One may be gazing at one of the lights and it gradually opens up and reveals a glimpse of a flying field, a wife at home, or a pilot speeding through a fog-ridden cavern in a mountainous region.The characters are exceptionally well drawn. Riviere, played by John Barrymore, is no heartless villain, but a disciplinarian whose aim is to make the night flights a success. He takes his chief inspector to task for dining with one of the pilots, explaining that superiors and their subordinates must keep their place no matter where. It is for the good of the air-mail service. Mr. Barrymore gives a sterling portrayal of this stern Riviere.Lionel Barrymore interprets the rôle of the inspector Robineau in his usual eminently satisfactory style. Helen Hayes is cast as Mme. Fabian, the distracted wife of a pilot. Clark Gable handles the part of Fabian, the aviator, who, with his colleague, parachutes to a watery grave. Robert Montgomery does well as the jolly young flier who brings his machine to port on time. C. Henry Gordon, William Gargan, Leslie Fenton and Frank Conroy are among others who deliver good performances.On the Capitol Stage.John Fogarty, an Irish tenor known as the \\"Voice of the West\\" to radio audiences, is at the Capitol theatre this week. Mr. Fogarty has a voice with perhaps a little more body to it than most, but in the matter of répertoire he is much like Irish tenors from other points of the compass. Al Trahan is one of those comedians who will do anything for a laugh, whether it happens to be very comical or not. He has a beautiful assistant, though.

And they are not really plays anyway, they are movie and television parasites.   It used to be that quality films and television shows aspired to theater's grandeur and high seriousness or frantically tried to imitate its comic chic and style. Well, those upstart forms have had their revenge. Theater is now busy trying to snatch grandeur back from the movies and to imitate (or, as some playwrights see it, to elevate) the speedy farcical brashness of television comedy. You see it in those ornate Broadway sets, costly leviathans built to wow the audience the way fancy movie locations and flashy movie stunt work used to.

In the first place, the picture was filled with adventaure, humor and romance. Then Secretary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur made a brief talk during the intermission and unveiled a painting of the Constitution, reproductions of which, are to be sold all over the country, the proceeds to go toward the fund for restoring the gallant old war vessel. And, as an additional feature of the entertainment, the scene that ended the first half of the picture was a startling surprise, for the standard screen disappeared and the whole stage, from the proscenium arch to the boards, was filled with a moving picture of a replica of Old Ironsides. This brought every man and woman in the audience to their feet and Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld's orchestra and a chorus of voices further stirred the spectators with \\"Ship of State.\\"Some conception of the magnificent effect of this enlarged screen can be galned from its dimensions, which are 30 by 40 feet, whereas the usual screen in the Rivoli is about 12 by 18. Following the intermission most of the scenes of \\"Old Ironsides,\\" were depicted by this apparatus, a device discovered by Glen Allvine of the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation. Mr. Allvine said that he called the idea or invention a magnascope. It is a magnifying lens attached to the ordinary projection machine.This wide angle screen was tremendously effective in the scenes of fighting aboard the old frigate off the coast of Tripoli, and also in those pictures of the imposing productions of the forts, with old-fashioned guns booming and the missiles splashing in the sea.In this picture Mr. Cruze, for the first time, gives a true conception of a frigate at sea. It was no millpond when these \\"shots\\" were photographed, the ocean being covered with white caps.The story has its full share of hokum, but it is the sort of stuff that one enjoys. Esther Ralston, as the Girl, wears semi-décolletée gowns throughout this photoplay, and her blond tresses are always waved to the pink of perfection. As an aid to the romance of this picture, Laurence Stallings, who is responsible for the story, has introduced a bark called the Esther, aboard which most of the principals are beheld during a tidy part of the adventure.The narrative contains a plentiful supply of excellent comedy, which is handled in vigorous fashion by those able screen actors, Wallace Berry and George Bancroft. Hence the audience one moment was stirred to outbursts of patriotic feeling, while the next episode caused them to roar with laughter. There were impressive scenes in Independence Hall, in Philadelphia, in which the famous speech concerned with \\"not one cent for tribute, but millions for defense,\\" was made. This was soon followed by Mr. Berry as a bos'n, with tattered trousers, a wig and earring's, on the lookout to shanghai victims. He first encounters the Boy, who is eager for adventure, and while he is putting this youth into \\"condition\\" to take aboard the Bather the greedy ex-gunner of the Constitution moves across the saloon to the bos'n's table and invites himself to have a drink. The bos'n is a calculating sort of scamp, and in the end he fills the Gunner up with greg and shanghaies him as well as the young man. This comes as a surprise to the audience, as the Gunner is a formidable fellow with a pigtail curled over the nape of his neck.The high light of the story is, of course, concerned with the defeat of the Barbary Coast pirates, but in order to have a love theme the Boy and the Girl meet on the Esther. He has been warned while at the helm to keep his gaze on the stars, which he finds a very difficult matter when the girl insists on fixing him with her deep blue eyes. There are kissing scenes at most inopportune moments, even when the Boy is shackled to three other men. And after this love scene, the quartet, who have escaped from the pirates, flop over into the water and, in a second or so, they get into a boat and are bound for the open sea.Mr. Cruze evidently delighted in eliciting humor from Mr. Beery and Mr. Bancroft, and he even has the two fighting each other, forgetting their manacles. When the Bos'n and the Gunner are rescued by the Constitution, it is the Gunner who has the upper hand. Stephen Decatur, then a Lieutenant (played by Johnny Walker) sentences the Gunner to 200 lashes, and when the time comes for the ordeal, he, Decatur, counts \\"one hundred\\" after the first stroke of the whip, and \\"two hundred\\" after the second","excerpt":"so the Gunner gets off pretty lightly for his crime of desertion. To add a touch of the olden sea days, salt is smeared on the Gunner's welted back, after which every one seems fairly cheerful.Mr. Cruze exhibits his skill by \\"shots\\" from all angles, and some of the most striking ones are those pictured from the masts of the Constitution. He has also introduced some sterling miniature photographs, which, in this case, fit in nicely with the other scenes.Commodore Preble of the Constitution is seen in his cabin shaving. Decatur suggests going over in a small boat and blowing up the Philadelphia, which had been captured by the pirates. The Commodore scoffs at the idea, but young Decatur goes forth in his small craft and carries out that daring scheme, which called forth the highest praise from Lord Nelson. You see the Philadelphia, and the pirates aboard being hoodwinked by Decatur, whose disguised men pretend that they have lost their anchor. The second the small craft gets alongside the Philadelphia, scores of men are uncovered and they clamber up the sides of the frigate, setting fire to the powder magazines. There is a thrilling flash when the vessel is beheld gradually disappearing below the water.Honors are fairly evenly divided among the performers, although Beery and Bancroft, if anything, get the best of the show. Miss Ralston is attractive as the heroine. Charles Farrell is exceptionally competent as the Boy. George Godfrey vies with Beery and Bancroft as a comedian. He, it is, who as a ship's cook does not believe in women aboard a ship. He has a habit of spitting through crossed fingers to kill any bad luck, and loud laughter greeted this trick each time he was seen doing it. Charles Hills Mailes gives a clever characer sketch of Commodore Preble.Besides Admiral Plunkett and a number of other naval officers, 300 marines and bluejackets formed part of the audience.

Airline takeoffs and landings at peak hours, into and out of the crowded airports, are obviously a very scarce good at present prices","excerpt":"so we see airplanes, filled with passengers, queuing up on runways for an hour or more, waiting for a chance to fly. That's a dreadfully inefficient way of rationing scarce goods. In a free market, their price would go up. To some extent this has happened under deregulation: We now have a much greater differentiation between airplane fares on peak and off peak. But it has obviously not gone far enough, because airports still don't differentiate their landing fees sufficiently.  If instead we were to permit airport slots to be auctioned off and/or purchased and sold, takeoff and landing rights at peak times would become very costly, as would the price of airline tickets at those times; the opposite would happen off peak. And everybody would benefit.  People to whom time is valuable and who have to use crowded airports at peak times would be able to do so without long delays, because people to whom time is less important compared with money will have an even greater opportunity than they have today to save money by shifting their travel to off-peak times and less- crowded routes.

There is the insistent paterfamilias, the plain aunt an old humbug named Sergeant Juan Dinero. If ever a bandit deserved the object of his affection, El Caballero does in this adventure. True he has all the advantage, for his sword is proof against those of a couple of dozen of his adversaries. He is caught and bound more than once, but he is too cunning for Ramon Torreno, who has cause to regret that he did not give the order to fire when El Caballero faced the firing squad.El Caballero is locked in a dungeon and at the last minute he pleads with Sergeant Dinero for a drink of water from a jug too large to put through the iron bars. The Sergeant, perhaps out of sheer conceit, opens the dungeon door and, as one expects, El Caballero grabs Dinero and soon one perceives the gallant bandit emerge with his physiognomy decorated with as much of the Sergeant's mustache as he has been able to cut off with his sword.During the course of this nonsensical yarn, El Caballero, while posing as an Indian, is given a chance to go free if he can outrun the dogs. El Caballero has a start of fifty paces and then, through the medium of the Photophone, one hears what is supposed to be the yelping of the dogs as they follow our hero.

But that ensemble represented just one area of exploration for Mr. Hemphill, above, who left the group in the early '90s and died in 1995. Mr. Hemphill was a saxophonist and flutist of deep, expressive authority, as he proved perhaps most vividly on an unaccompanied solo album called ''Blue Boyé,'' released on his own label in 1977. (The alto saxophonist Tim Berne, who was at the original recording session, has reissued it on his label, Screwgun Records.) It was Mr. Hemphill's restless vision, though, as a composer that made the greater and more lasting impact. As far back as his first album, the magnificent (and unfortunately out-of-print) ''Dogon A.D.'' in 1972, he was sculpturing pulse and timbre in ways that loosely tethered free improvisation to aspects of rhythm and blues. And he grew more ambitious over the years, producing works like ''Long Tongues,'' which he described as a saxophone opera. Selections from that opus will be revisited in the Miller Theater's ''Composer Portraits'' tribute next week, by a saxophone sextet under the direction of Marty Ehrlich","excerpt":"so will the entirety of ''Dogon A.D.,'' by a quartet composed of Mr. Ehrlich on alto saxophone, Baikida Carroll (who played on the original) on trumpet, Erik Friedlander on cello and Pheeroan akLaff on drums. As on an illuminating album issued by Tzadik Records in 2003, Mr. Hemphill's chamber piece ''One Atmosphere'' will be performed by the pianist Ursula Oppens with a string quartet (Ethel, in this case). And the program will include ''Mingus Gold,'' as tackled by Ethel, and ''The Hard Blues,'' a loft-scene classic that should provide an earthy showcase for Mr. Friedlander.

Thirteen years ago, 53 percent of the women surveyed cited motherhood as one of the best parts of being a woman, for example, and in the latest poll just 26 percent did. Work outside the home was more peripheral then, with only 9 percent of the women even listing it as an enjoyable part of their lives. This time, 26 percent did.

It was probably one of Vilma Banky's first pictures, and while she is far prettier than most of the foreign actresses she really looks older in this subject than she does in \\"The Magic Flame,\\" which came out of Hollywood quite recently.The story has a bright basic idea, and there's no telling how good it might have been if it had been made with the present improvements in Hollywood. It is the sort of thing that makes you say that the scenes are preposterous, but you are tempted to stay and learn how the story comes out","excerpt":"so, after all, the tale is better told than most of the film features, for it is so often quite obvious that a woman will be acquitted of murder or that the hero will never be shot by the firing squad. Here, there is a shrewd crook, a man who enjoys his nefarious activities, one who appears as a crafty impersonator on the stage, but whose main idea is to get his fingers on the brilliant gems that lie on velvet shelves in a cabinet.This Valescu baffles the police, for he may appear before them as a waiter or a statesman and even give them a clue. He can look twenty-five or seventy-five as the mood takes him. Miss Banky plays the part of Yvonne Baron, who strikes one as the personification of fair innocence, until she slowly signals with her long-lashed eyes. In one sequence she engages a room above Prince Rudolph's, and, as in the picturization of \\"Seventh Heaven,\\" you see the unsuspecting Prince looking over hundreds of diamonds and then you are taken up to the room above and Yvonne is perceived talking to Valescu over the telephone. Valescu is in his den, which is ingeniously guarded from the police.Not long after Miss Banky is introduced she is seen in a bathtub, and the caption writer explains that she has just returned from a tedious journey. Yvonne relishes a life of luxury and she takes her duties as assistant to Valescu very easily, never permitting anything to perturb her and frequently making unfortunate persons very uncomfortable.Ernest Reicher figures as Valescu. He is energetic and obedient, but there are times when his disguises might possibly arouse the suspicion of the most myopic policeman. This production was directed by Manfred Noa.

That ballet seems as much a part of the festive season as ornaments on a tree, and its score by Tchaikovsky may be the world's most famous ballet music.   The New York City Ballet opens its annual engagement of George Balanchine's ''Nutcracker'' on Thursday. A hit since its premiere in 1954, this version is probably the one that is most familiar to Americans. It is also close in spirit to the original ''Nutcracker,'' produced by the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg in 1892 with choreography by Lev Ivanov. ''Nutcracker'' concerns a little girl - Balanchine calls her Marie - who is given a nutcracker by her eccentric godfather Drosselmeyer at a Christmas Eve party. Falling asleep, she dreams that she and the nutcracker battle some marauding mice. The nutcracker then changes into a prince and takes her through the land of snow to the palace of the Sugar Plum Fairy, where she is entertained with fanciful divertissements.

She does so at the most awkward moments. Mr. Denny, as James Norton, a wealthy bachelor, is fond of the child, who has been brought up under the wing of a strangely hard fostermother.Mr. Norton plays with Pudge, and even when guests are expected he is to be seen amusing the child in a game of hide and seek. Friends of Mr. Norton hadn't even the foggiest notion that he had undertaken the duties of a father, and so when Sylvia Van Tassel and her mother enter Mr. Norton's lavishly furnished home they are somewhat dismayed to discover him on his knees with his hands covering his eyes at the far end of a long room. Realizing his awkward predicament, Mr. Norton endeavors to explain matters with hardly fluent white lies, while he also essays to keep Pudge from sight.\\"That's my daddy,\\" is Pudge's fondest boast, and she ejeculates this surprising information from the rail of a yacht at the moment Mr. Norton is doing his best to concentrate on the marriage service while an orchestra is playing softly the wedding march. These words in a shrill child's voice, hurled at the bride-groom-to-be before a host of people, naturally create consternation, and Pudge adds to the general excitement by falling into the water, which prompts Mr. Norton to leap to the youngster's rescue. This was not the only stretch of this picture that evoked hearty outbursts of meriment from the thousands within the Roxy's portals.\\"That's My Daddy\\" is a thoroughly wholesome comedy, one that may not be overwhelmingly deep in story, but it possesses some excellently filmed incidents. It is another of those yarns that bring to mind \\"Helen's Babies,\\" and while the two youngsters of that old book may have left little undone, Pudge, as a singleton, and a girl at that, gives a mighty good idea of the trouble that can be created by a cub blonde who yearns for a daddy.Norton is in a dilemma after having accepted the presence of Pudge, for when he quietly tells Pudge that he is, of course, not her daddy, she bursts into a flood of tears, which causes Mr. Norton to change his tactics","excerpt":"so, in order to quiet the child, he insists that she is right, that he is her daddy. Pudge cares not who sees her mouth wide open as she betrays her grief. She has found a good-looking, wealthy daddy, and she is not going to be deprived of him. Pudge even has the temerity to make a suggestion as to whom she would like for a mother.This picture is nicely produced, with a yacht to supply splendor after you have left the richly decorated rooms of Mr. Norton's home.Mr. Denny, who is credited with the authorship of the story, gives a most pleasing performance as the frequently worried adopted father. Pudge is played by a young person boasting of the name of Jane La Verne. This youngster responds amazingly to direction. She is very, very sad when she ought to be and she is the personification of joy when playing hide and seek with her newfound daddy. Lillian Rich is attractive as the snobbish girl, and Barbara Kent is charmingly sympathetic as the grown-up heroine.There are some interesting Movietone features, an artistic stage contribution called \\"A Study in Black and White\\" and an effective Lincoln \\"In Memoriam\\" offering on the program.

(July 4) is right on target in stating that the work of independent producers is ''getting unprecedented exposure on public television these days'' and that public television has ''offered completion funds and technical expertise'' for a great number of independent projects.   However, in his subsequent speculation about the ''political climate'' within which independent producers and public television now operate, Mr. O'Connor offers no evidence to back up his alarming warnings about government influence on public television.

For example, he said, Syria was kept on Washington's list of countries that sponsor terrorism, despite its help in averting terrorist assaults in Europe and the Mideast during the gulf war and its efforts to obtain freedom for American hostages being held in Lebanon.

Mr. Sharaa accused Israel of sponsoring \\"state terrorism.\\"    Mr. Sharaa denounced what he called \\"a new media campaign\\" in the United States to portray Syria as a \\"new Iraq\\" that would be Israel's eternal enemy. Saying Syria wanted peace, he said Israel \\"keeps erecting new obstacles and demands that risk squandering the post-gulf-war peace momentum.\\"   He said Syria still believes that Israel and its Arab foes should meet under the auspices of an international peace conference, a demand that Israel rejects.

For some time now, bright young scholars in England and America have been flinging themselves headlong into the study of the original Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood - Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais - and their followers. And along with the Pre-Raphaelites, the Victorian school, more or less dominated by the    echt    Royal Academician Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, began to exchange its high camp status for a new legitimacy in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Since that time - as collector interest has followed that of scholars, and sometimes vice-versa - prices in both fields, which had all but bottomed out by the mid-20th century, have risen precipitously. (We are in the next year or two to be regaled with an exhibition of    American    Pre-Raphaelites, yet, co-sponsored by the Brooklyn Museum and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, which will certainly heat up some names now all but forgotten.)

This is the first time women's soccer has been included in the Summer Games, and the American women come into it as a  favorite. Meanwhile, the United States men have been perennially outplayed in the Summer Games by promising young stars from traditional soccer powers, but that could shift. THE SETUP In keeping the recent Olympic practice of spreading soccer games to other cities, both the women's and men's tournaments will be held in Miami, Orlando, Fla., Birmingham, Ala., and Washington, with medal rounds to be held in Athens, Ga. No games will be played in Atlanta.          The American women, coached by Tony DiCicco, are one of the world's best teams, having won the 1991 World Cup and finishing second to Norway in 1995. The American men, coached by Bruce Arena, are a mixed bag of promising young players and three experienced players. Because of the political power of the world soccer body, known as FIFA, each nation in the Summer Games is allowed to use only three players age 23 or older. This gives every nation an opportunity to polish its young stars for the next World Cup, the highest level of world soccer.

A laboratory analysis conducted yesterday in Rome confirmed the results of a previous test in which traces of the drug were found in his urine sample, taken after a game on March 17 in Bari, Italy. Maradona, a 30-year-old professional from Argentina, has played for the Naples team in the Italian league since 1984.   The announcement of the test results was made by the Italian Soccer Federation, which will set the length of suspension next week. According to the rules of the international federation for soccer, which are far more strict than those governing drug offenses in American professional sports leagues, a first offense for cocaine use would mean an automatic two-year suspension. For Maradona, the maximum penalty would mean he would be 32 years old, and beyond his prime, before he returned to soccer.   Any penalty would apply in all 154 countries affiliated with the international body, the Federation Internationale de Football Association, commonly known by the acronym FIFA.   By comparison, a player in the National Football League would have to fail tests for cocaine three times before being suspended indefinitely, with the right of review after one year. Others Tarnished by Drug     While Maradona is hardly the first professional athlete to have been linked to cocaine use, he is easily the most famous. Other athletes whose careers have been tarnished include such notable American stars as Dwight Gooden of the Mets and Dexter Manley of the Washington Redskins. In addition, the 1986 death of Len Bias, a basketball star from the University of Maryland, was ruled to be related to cocaine use.   A product of the Buenos Aires slums who made as much as $3 million in annual salary and three times that in commercial endorsements, Maradona nurtured his legend with his stunning control of the ball, crackling maneuverability and a powerful left foot as dangerous scoring goals as setting them up with impossible passes. In 1986, as national team captain, he led Argentina to the World Cup championship in Mexico. In the same role last summer in Italy, he wept openly when Germany defeated Argentina in the final.   He also led Naples to its first two championships in the Italian club league, in 1987 and 1990, the equivalent of Super Bowl victories, and in 1989 to victory in the even more prestigious European club championship.   But Maradona's flamboyance extended beyond the soccer fields and made him one of the world's most prominent sports celebrities. His wedding reception two years ago cost millions of dollars and fed gossip columns for months.   For more than a decade, words hardly did him justice.   Franz Beckenbauer, once West Germany's greatest player and coach of the 1990 world championship team: \\"Maradona is the great player every team wants to have.\\"   Guy Thys, the Belgium team coach after the 1986 World Cup: \\"If Maradona was in my team, Belgium would have been in the final.\\"   Arrigo Sacchi, the coach of A.C. Milan of the Italian league: \\"Maradona was even greater than Pele.\\"   But in more recent years, the accolades became mixed with criticism, as Maradona, never a stranger to controversy, found himself its constant companion. Eccentricities and More     At first, they were merely impish episodes of a rich eccentric: missed practices here and there, unauthorized extensions of a summer or winter vacation, or arguments with coaches.   But more recently, his off-the-field involvements took on more somber and serious tones.   Four months ago, he shocked both his Naples teammates and his adoring fans when he inexplicably refused to travel to Moscow for Naples's match against Spartak Moscow in the European Champion's Cup tournament, the continent's most prestigious club competition. Maradona eventually changed his mind and arrived in time for the match, but Naples lost on penalty kicks and was eliminated from the tournament.   After another unexcused absence by Maradona in Italy two weeks later, the club owner, Corrado Ferlaino, filed a breach of contract suit against the player, asking for damages of up to $5 million. Feeling the Pressure     In his defense, Maradona said that he had asked Ferlaino to release him from his contract, which expires in 1993, more than two years ago.   \\"I just can't take the pressure of playing in Italy anymore,\\" Maradona confessed in a television interview in December. \\"The pressure of games, of practices, and of the newspapers, always talking about Maradona. It's not that I don't want to accept the responsibility. I can't. I can't be the person or the player I was.\\"   Worse was to come. On Feb. 13, the Italian weekly magazine Epoca reported that Maradona's name had come up during an investigation of drug trafficking and prostitution in Naples. Two days later, at his own request, Maradona was interrogated for three hours by the officials conducting the investigation. Maradona, who has two daughters, admitted to having solicited the services of prostitutes but denied having used cocaine. Staying in Villa     One week after his testimony, he was informed by a Naples district attorney that he was under investigation for the possession and distribution of cocaine.   \\"I knew something like this would happen when I announced that I wanted to leave Naples,\\" he said on the steps of the courthouse after his testimony. \\"My lawyers will handle it.\\" Soccer","excerpt":"Soccer Star Faces Suspension for Cocaine"},{"year":"1962","title":"PARIS, Nov. 5--The other English players all had hated it.

One is the show that Linda Hyman has organized at the ACA Galleries, 21 East 67th Street, under the title ''Social Art in America, 1930-1945'' (through Nov. 28). The other is the show that Barbara Rose has organized at New York University's Grey Art Gallery, 33 Washington Place in Washington Square, under the title ''Krasner/Pollock: A Working Relationship'' (through Dec. 12). Each in its own very different way is an interesting event in itself, yet both acquire an additional interest when seen in relation to the other. For the whole attitude toward art that is upheld in the ''Social Art in America'' exhibition is categorically rejected in most of the work we see in the Lee Krasner/Jackson Pollock exhibition at N.Y.U.   It is worth recalling, however, that Pollock served his artistic apprenticeship in the social art movement that is documented in the ACA show. For this reason, it is appropriate that he should be represented in that show by a small painting from the 30's called ''Cotton Pickers.'' This is the only point at which these two exhibitions actually meet. (Lee Krasner, on the other hand, seems never to have been much drawn to the social art movement even when she was painting in a figurative mode.)

O'Neill Jr. can come to terms and instruct their respective political associates on what kind of a deal would be acceptable.   But the White House, as Senator Bob Dole, a ranking Republican and member of the commission, put it, ''has been frightened to death by Social Security,'' and the Democratic leadership seems no more eager to settle the issue, since all the solutions would be politically painful.   Yet, one way or another, Congress and the Administration must agree on some plan for reducing benefits and/or increasing inflows to the trust fund by $150 billion to $200 billion through the rest of this decade.   Although most reformers think the short-range answer should be linked to the long-term solution, reaching 75 years into the future, Congress seems unlikely to commit itself to a long-run answer now.  The real crisis in the system will not come until after the year 2010, when the postwar baby-boom generation begins to reach retirement age.

D1    ARTS   E1-8    Broadway's New Math  Broadway attendance is up 4 percent from the same period last year, while total box-office receipts for the season are up 12 percent.

In a remarkable book, ''Economic Effects of Social Security,'' published by Brookings, Mr. Aaron concludes that other economists have been no more able than he to prove whether Social Security increases or decreases saving or labor supply.   In the mid-1960's, the late Prof. George Katona of the University of Michigan and Prof. Philip Cagan of Columbia published separate studies suggesting that Social Security increased saving by bringing retirement within reach of people who otherwise would have considered it unaffordable. Their findings were regarded skeptically by other economists, but not exploded by fresh statistical evidence.

Your editorial implied that medical care for mental illness was available only to those able to pay $150 a visit. Though I cannot say that there are no psychiatrists who charge $150 per session, it certainly does not represent the usual range of charges throughout the state. Indeed, psychiatric treatment has always been available to all who need it through a whole range of providers, public, voluntary and private, and for a wide range of fees.  Your editorial points out that anxiety and depression are not confined to the affluent and that treatment should be available to all. We certainly agree with this and feel strongly that there should not be a two-tiered system of care, dependent on ability to pay.  Of critical importance in the treatment of anxiety and depression is the diagnosis and evaluation that must precede the decision as to what type of treatment is appropriate.  As innumerable articles in your newspaper have pointed out, such symptoms often have a biological basis and a host of treatment modalities are available, biological and psychopharmacological, as well as psychotherapeutic, depending on the diagnostic assessment.

If serious belief in socialism is indeed dead in the West, how do we account for the current governments of France, Greece and Spain? Have these countries, unknown to me, been removed from the West? If so, when was this mysterious decision made? What, too, shall we say about Burlington, Vt., with its socialist mayor? Has it also joined the ranks of non-Western territories within the West?
