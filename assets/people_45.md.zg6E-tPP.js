It is the first of many images of a society in which everyone has gone a little batty and crime is so rampant that a knock on the door is as likely to signal an armed robbery as a neighborly visit.   The film, which opens today at the Quad Cinema, focuses on the tumultuous domestic life of three eccentric women who share an apartment in an unnamed port city. Gertrudes (Norma Bengell), a strait-laced widow and piano teacher of 60, fancies herself a surrogate mother for her two troublesome boarders. Sensual, defiantly free-spirited Madalena (Maria Zilda Bethlem), who works as a nurse in a mental hospital, enjoys embarrassing the prudish Gertrudes by parading bare-breasted in front of the window. At night, she prowls the local cafes, picking up men and having quick, wild sex in odd places.

They said that a 14-month investigation had turned up some new witnesses who contradicted his testimony about his whereabouts around the time of the killing. They also found the murder weapon, which disappeared in 1964 after his second trial ended, like his first, with a deadlocked all-white jury. Mr. Beckwith said last week that the charges had been revived simply \\"to beat the public drum and make the lower forms of life violent against the country club set.\\" But many see it otherwise in 1990's Mississippi. \\"Beckwith is linked with the hatred and violence of the 50's and 60's,\\" said David Sansing, a University of Mississippi historian. \\"I think this indictment represents the beginning of a cleansing process.\\" Headliners","excerpt":"Trying Again"},{"year":"1995","title":"It has long been one of the defining symbols of summer in New York City: the open fire hydrant, gushing needed relief from the fierce heat and humidity that seems to invade the five boroughs every July.

The big one puts out his hand and booms: \\"I'm J. Peter Throgmorton. That's me.\\" The small, sallow one puts out his hand and mumbles: \\"I'm Lycurgus Threep. That isn't me.\\"Michael Rubbo is a Canadian who makes Threeplike documentaries. His theme, as he goes from place to place, is the impossibility of getting at very much reality in any of them.Most documentaries proclaim, stridently or politely: \\"This is it,\\" or at least, \\"This is part of it.\\" In his two funny fresh and mostly admirable films on Indonesia and Cuba, Mr. Rubbo's message is: \\"This isn't it.\\"The films are being shown by Film Forum at the Vandam Theater through Sunday and, again. Thursday through Nov. 23 at 8 P.M.Mr. Rubbo photographs and asks questions and then asks himself what significance or truth or relevance can possibly be contained in what he has filmed or asked. He and his crew set down their camera in a jammed slum in Jakarta or a mental hospital near Havana. They interrupt life, slide off the realities and leave their footprints all around.But most documentaries carefully conceal their footprints. Mr. Rubbo photographs his.In the film on Indonesia \\"Wet Earth and Warm People,\\" for example, where Mr. Rubbo is trying to encompass the vast, horrendous population-poverty cycle, we see him visibly lost on a swarming street, wondering what possible question or approach could even begin to make a dent.Husky, copper-bearded, direct, he has that self-awareness so rare in both journalists and film makers. He knows his simple presence is enough to scare off the tenuous clues he is seeking.\\"My cameraman looks like a small colonialist,\\" he muses, standing beside a Landrover from which his crew is unloading equipment. \\"I look like one of the Dutch soldiers who used to be here.\\"He tries: he puts up a line of inquiry. For example he learns that the Jakarta authorities are trying to get rid of the swarms of pedicabs, their place presumably to be taken by taxis. This seems monstrous to him: the one available asset—millions of unemployed legs—to be replaced by expensive and polluting gasoline engines.He goes about interviewing a pedicab driver, the Mayor, the Chief of Police","excerpt":"trying to ask why. The answers are vague, bland and polite. Gradually his question fades; so does his own certainty that it is a question to be asked.So he lets his camera roam. There is a splendid sequence showing him projecting a film in a village: in the tropical, bug-ridden night the villagers stare big-eyed at a demonstration of how to build an igloo.Even more surreal is the running relationship of good will and incomprehension between Mr. Rubbo and Indonesia's chief of police. Toward the end he shows the police chief and a few friends, decked out in bright-colored pareus, crooning \\"The Way You Look at Me\\" on national television.\\"How much it's calculated is hard to say, but I do know he's trying to change the image of the police,\\" Mr. Rubbo comments soberly. He doesn't mock the incongruousness of the scene. He wonders at it, and at his own wonderment. He doesn't spare his own foolishness, and out of it he has constructed a movie that has a beginning of wisdom.\\"Waiting for Fidel,\\" is stronger and tighter but basically it takes the same approach. It is about Cuba, in a way, but it is also about the difficulty in seeing Cuba for what it may be. Again, Mr. Rubbo holds his camera no higher than his own head; it is a perplexed, ambiguous head.What he is filming, in fact, is a traveling argument. His trip to Cuba is taken in the company of two antagonists. One is Joseph Smallwood, a former Premier of Nova Scotia, a lifelong Socialist with a bubbling enthusiasm for the new Cuba. The other is Geoffrey Stirling, a self-made millionaire who is financing the trip and who wields a fierce suspicion of what he is seeing.It is part holiday, part adventure, part inquiry, and it starts with a naive burst of enthusiasm. They have been promised an interview with Fidel Castro. And almost from the first shots it is clear to any journalist who has been promised the same thing that they are in the category of the middling honored visitor: They will get endless hospitality and no interview.While they wait, they take strenuous guided tours around the island. They muse and argue about what they have seen: The fascination is in how little two shrewd and experienced men like Mr. Smallwood and Mr. Stirling really do see.Mr. Rubbo likes the Cuban revolution, but he does not anchor the film to his liking. Perplexity is his instrument for measuring the world, and he never lets go of it.There are disadvantages in the method: a certain blandness, a sameness. If Mr. Rubbo gets around to doing Lapland or Borneo, they may end up more alike than different. He will be standing before the camera in seeming disarray, saying: \\"This is Lapland (or Borneo). But it isn't.\\"But these disadvantages should not mask his accomplishment. Most documentaries are speeches to the audience or stories told to the audience. His come close to being a dialogue.

The banks are driving to protect themselves, and cutting loans is one way of trying -- but one that poses severe risks to local communities and the economy as a whole. Economic Scene","excerpt":"Trying to Soothe Scared Bankers"},{"year":"1985","title":"FOR the better part of a year, regional banks have constituted one favorite area for trying to spot possible takeovers. In turn, this has done wonders for the prices of many regional bank stocks, making them one of the best-performing sectors of the equity market.   Since the game of picking takeover targets is based on conjecture, investors are best advised to follow a policy of selecting stocks for their fundamental appeal and reasonable price levels, rather than for wishful takeover prospects.   A recent Supreme Court ruling, affirming the constitutionality of regional interstate banking zones, has focused the takeover spotlight anew on regional banks. The Court's decision signals ''a large victory for regional banking,'' said George M. Salem of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

The payoff can be handsome if groundwork and guesswork prove correct. Unfortunately, an infallible memorandum on the subject has yet to be written.

Take, for example, the more than 3,000 reports that Federal departments and agencies are required by law to submit to Congress at a cost of perhaps $240 million a year. The survival of many is a testament not just to the capital's penchant for analytical overkill but to the politician's inability to oppose bad ideas that have been framed to sound good.   The Energy Department, under a 1978 law, must make a report every year on the nation's coal reserves, which are so vast that by conservative estimate they will last for at least three centuries.

The fund may also buy convertible securities, preferred stocks, bonds or money market securities, Merrill Lynch said.    Such guidelines give the fund's portfolio manager a rather free hand.

Thus, when Ronald Reagan went to Charlotte, N.C., last year and declared that busing was a failed ''social experiment that nobody wants,'' The Charlotte Observer's indignant editorial reply was headlined: ''You Were Wrong, Mr. President.''

During the 1940's, he and his brother Rodney, as the Balfa Brothers, became regional stars playing at dance halls and house parties. They later brought Cajun music to folk festivals around the country. Mr. Balfa will be joined by Steve Riley (on accordion), Tony Schwarz (on guitar) and Peter Schwarz (on fiddle).

Officials estimate that another 7,000 groups exist unofficially. The efforts show that even as sectarian violence tears Iraq's cities apart, a growing number of Iraqis are trying to bring them together.   A1    Only 48 hours after Iraq's new government took office, the British prime minister, Tony Blair, flew to Baghdad to discuss an issue crucial to Iraq, as well as to the politics of the war in London and Washington: when British and American troops can start to withdraw.   A14    Underdog Surges in Mexico  In the race for presidency of Mexico, Felipe Calderón, fond of portraying himself as the underdog, has surged past the front-runner, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, with a stream of advertisements portraying Mr. López Obrador as a dangerous, violent leftist who will bankrupt the country.   A1    U.S. Jets Kill Afghan Civilians  American military planes in pursuit of suspected Taliban fighters bombed a village in southern Afghanistan, killing 16 civilians and wounding 15, among them women and children, the local governor and villagers said.   A10    New Ways to Recall Holocaust  Israel, 58 years after the Holocaust, is trying to cope with the fading of history. As the number of survivors and perpetrators dwindles, Israel has been exploring ways of preserving the memory of the Holocaust, including trips to former concentration camps and bringing Israeli youth together with survivors.   A8    A Redrawing of Balkan Borders  Fifteen years after ethnic conflict broke out in the western Balkans, Montenegro appears to have voted by a bare margin to separate from Serbia. The move may be the last phase in redefining borders of the region, possibly leaving Serbia as the only remaining republic of the six that once formed Yugoslavia.   A10    Debate on Aid to India's Castes  As India prospers it faces a polarizing totem of public policy: a government proposal to extend quotas for admission to some of the country's prestigious federally financed universities for the lowest castes on the Hindu social ladder and indigenous tribes.   A3    Former Opposites Unite in Syria  Abdel Halim Khaddam, Syria's former vice president, and Ali Sadreddin al-Bayanouni, the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, have formed the National Salvation Front, an alliance with the dual goals of unifying Syria's opposition and reassuring insiders fearful of change.

A1    Democrats Try to Blunt Scandal  Democrats' plans to make Republican corruption a central theme of their election strategy this year were complicated by accusations of wrongdoing in their own ranks, leading them to try to blunt the political effects of the unfolding case against Representative William J. Jefferson.   A18    Challenging Schwarzenegger  Two fixtures of Democratic politics in California -- Phil Angelides, the state treasurer who made a fortune as a real estate developer, and Steve Westly, the controller who made even more money as a founder of eBay -- are in a battle to take on Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, in November.   A16    Congress Looks Back to 1986  As the debate on immigration reaches a boil, Congress is haunted by Senate Bill 1200, the failed amnesty legislation of 1986. Today, senators who favor a path to citizenship say they have learned from the past.   A20    Disorder in the Courts  In the nine months since Hurricane Katrina, more than a thousand defendants have languished in jail without access to lawyers. The New Orleans public defender system is desperately short of money and manpower, says Judge Arthur L. Hunter Jr.   A1    Busy Hurricane Season Seen  Forecasters predict that 13 to 16 tropical storms will form in the Atlantic during the six-month hurricane season that begins June 1.   A16    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Clintons Display Unity In Separate Public Lives  Since leaving the White House, Bill and Hillary Clinton have built largely separate lives -- partly because of the demands of their distinct career paths and partly as a result of political calculations, according to interviews and a review of their activities.   A1    New Trial in Subway Murder  The mentally ill man who pushed a 32-year-old journalist and photographer to her death in front of a speeding subway train after he stopped taking his antipsychotic medication will get a new trial after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal from New York State.   B1    Ex-Governor's Memoir  Former Gov. James E. McGreevey, who resigned in 2004 after declaring that he was gay and that he had had an extramarital affair, was so determined to climb New Jersey's political ladder that he hid the fact that he was gay by masquerading as a womanizer, according to his memoir.

And he wasted his time, they thought, conducting the Harvard Band and playing accordion.         But when Arthur Fiedler, then the enterprising young conductor of the Boston  Pops, heard the Cambridge-born Anderson's arrangements of Harvard songs, he recognized something in the composer's work that the professors had not. Fiedler started using Anderson as an orchestrator and encouraged him to write pieces for the Pops. Finally, in 1938, Anderson complied, with \\"Jazz Pizzicato\\" and \\"Jazz Legato,\\" both immediate audience favorites. Over the next 25 years he composed some 50 more light classics, which virtually defined the sound of the American pops orchestra.

The exhibition ''The Art of Music, American Paintings and Musical Instruments, 1770-1910,'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris (Park Avenue and 42d Street) through Sept. 19, underscores this fresh interest and whets the appetite for fuller fare, being more appetizer than main course. \\n\\n The exhibition brings together 38 musical instruments and 22 paintings that illustrate how music played an integral part in early American life. This is strikingly illustrated in the pairing of ''Man With Bass Viol,'' a painting done around 1835 by an anonymous artist, with the instrument itself, a large model by Abraham Prescott, dated 10 years earlier. Another anonymous painting, ''Portrait of a Lady With an Accordion,'' depicting an elegantly attired and coiffured young woman of the 1840's, informs us as to the sort of instrument thought genteel - as were spinets, harpsichords and pianofortes - for a refined lady to play. The painting comes to life in the accordion (circa 1830) fashioned by an anonymous craftsman with wood keyboard, mother-of-pearl keys and mahogany box. ''Old Kentucky Home'' (1863), by John Whetten Ehninger, has a figure seated on the right with a banjo that has its counterpart in the William Boucher Jr. version (circa 1840), which has the look of a Brancusi sculpture.

The cinematic tunnel had to endure flooding of tidal-wave proportions, as well as major explosions. So the movie's executive producer, Raffaella De Laurentiis, decided to do her own tunneling, in Rome. After getting permission from the Port Authority to scrutinize the Holland Tunnel, De Laurentiis built a thousand-foot clone in three months for $1.7 million. (The genuine article took seven years, cost a whopping -- for then -- $48 million and opened in 1927.) SUNDAY, October 26, 1995: INFRASTRUCTURE","excerpt":"Tunnel Vision"},{"year":"1996","title":"Last Wednesday evening, a little bookshop on Rockefeller Plaza resounded with discussions of intricate detail and exquisite scholarship. \\"The D-types were my favorite cars but the fact is they had to go,\\" said one man who gestured excitedly to his nodding conversation partner. \\"They were old and slow. Sometimes you have to kill the sacred cows.\\" Said another man to a rapt young lady: \\"When people ask me whether the PATH train is better than the subway, I say what time of day? What day of the week?\\"  They were among the trainophiles gathered at New York Bound Bookshop, which specializes in works about the city. In theory the attraction was a book signing in honor of the publication of James Clifford Greller's \\"Subway Cars of the BMT\\" and Susie Tanenbaum's \\"Underground Harmonies.\\" In practice the signing party was a nice excuse for a gathering of that rare breed of New Yorker, the subway fanatic. People at the party said the city has about two dozen hardcore subway scholars,  who write detailed monographs on the subject and maybe a few thousand assorted trainspotters, who record subway movements, and hobbyists, who just love to think about trains. Almost all are men -- this is somehow a male fixation -- and most are middle-aged. Although there are clubs for them like the 500-member Electric Railroaders Association, many work alone. So the 40 enthusiasts who came to the bookstore renewed old acquaintances with pleasure as they drank wine and listened to Jon Graseck, a violinist who usually plays in the subway. Mostly they get along, but there are some burning issues that divide them. Some claim that specific lines like the No. 3 are superior to  others. Some believe that Fiorello La Guardia saved the subway by unifying it under the control of the city in the 1930's and others think he ruined it. \\"You get people who will argue over what train stopped where in 1932,\\" said Joe  Cunningham, a 44-year-old engineer from Jackson Heights, Queens, and habitual No. 7 rider who writes about trains full time. \\"If it's relevant to history it makes sense, but at other times it becomes absurd.\\" The star of the night was Mr. Greller, a New Jersey Transportation Department executive who has published three transportation books. He worked the room, signing books and cracking jokes. Typical for a local train fanatic, he is city  born, in his case Brooklyn, and motivated both by a romance for powerful machines and by a nostalgia for New York the way it used to be. \\"Brooklyn was like the Florence of the transportation business,\\" he said, relating the building of the BMT to the flowering of the Renaissance. Most in the room love to toss off arcane facts like the old name of the G line (the GG) and the reason that IRT trains can't run in the rest of the system (the IRT cars are narrower to fit into tunnels that are older and tighter than the rest). These fanatics say they are also motivated by the idea that without them  much subway history would be lost.

With nothing to wear to a Tom Jones concert in 1970, Mr. Chavez improvised: he made a vest out of the pop-tops he pulled off soda and beer cans. The crowd cheered. Mr. Chavez was reborn as the creator of the short-lived fad of pop-topping, turning trash into clothing that resembled medieval chain mail. His story is told by Jane and Michael Stern in their exhaustive but exhausting new book, THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BAD TASTE (HarperCollins, $29.99). It's all here -- chihuahuas, Liberace, Polynesian cuisine -- made for a place on the coffee table next to the Lava Lite. Like their earlier \\"Elvis World,\\" this book is well researched and full of gee-whiz details. Some sections are priceless, like the painful tale of the artists Walter and Margaret Keane, who went to court over whose idea it was to paint waiflike children with enormous eyes. However, too many entries are as spicy as Jell-O. Kitsch and camp have become mainstream in American life. Apparently the Sterns have not caught on. They are either wink-wink, nudge-nudge smarmy or downright preachy. Their cleverness is strained","excerpt":"Tupperware, they write, \\"brings order and calm to a home, vocalizing its airtight perfection with a gaseous burp every time you seal it closed.\\" \\"The Encyclopedia of Bad Taste\\" describes the dubious art of making something from nothing, whether it be pop-top vests, pantyhose dolls or aerosol cheese. It is a lesson in taste the Sterns themselves might heed: their book includes more than 25 references to Elvis, from bouffants (Priscilla's) to smile-face rings (Lisa Marie's) to velvet painting (if you need to ask, this is not the book for you).

And appropriately, her approach was unabashedly pianistic much of the time, with dynamics ranging from a barely audible dying away at the end of the Aria to a hearty Rachmaninoffian crescendo at the end of the epic 25th Variation.   But at other times Miss Tureck seemed to adopt willingly the limitations of harpsichord style, determinedly differentiating the dynamic levels of the two hands for long stretches, even when, as in the 11th Variation, this disrupted smooth exchanges of material between hands. This separation may have stemmed from an analogy to separate keyboards on the harpsichord, as may also the heavy reliance on echo effects in the canonic variations. But however much these contrasty echoes -- and reverse echoes, with the second voice falling weightily atop an understated first -- may clarify individual entries, they tend to unbalance the continuous contrapuntal flow.
