I.: Artificial Intelligence'' (2001), which Kubrick began before his death in 1999 and Steven Spielberg finished. After an introductory lecture by the museum's chief curator, David Schwartz, the retrospective fun begins tomorrow with a restored 70-millimeter print of ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the 1968 science fiction classic that defined psychedelia, starring Keir Dullea, above, as an interplanetary astronaut with a mutinous computer. It will be followed by the lesser-known ''Killer's Kiss,'' an indie-style film about a boxer, and ''The Killing,'' a heist flick, both made in the mid-1950's. Then the leading men start rolling along, among them Kirk Douglas fighting World War I in ''Paths of Glory'' and leading a Roman slave rebellion in ''Spartacus,'' James Mason romancing a junior high school girl in ''Lolita,'' Ryan O'Neal social-climbing in a powdered wig in ''Barry Lyndon,'' Jack Nicholson haunting an empty hotel in ''The Shining,'' a futuristic Malcolm McDowell learning that crime doesn't pay in ''A Clockwork Orange,'' Peter Sellers going nuclear in ''Dr. Strangelove'' and the omnipresent Tom Cruise partying with the rich and debauched in ''Eyes Wide Shut.''

FODERARO     FOR more than three years, television executives have bemoaned the void left by Arsenio Hall, the first successful black host of a late-night talk show. They have waited patiently for someone who had the power to enthrall young African-American viewers while crossing over to a wider audience, someone capable of delivering a high-energy show that would make the two reigning princes of late night, Jay Leno and David Letterman, look downright dowdy.              Well, they may have found him, in stereo.     Earlier this month, on the same night, at the same time (11 in New York City), Keenen Ivory Wayans and Chris Spencer, both Black comedians with neat goatees and neon smiles, made their debuts from Los Angeles. In a droll nod to their syndication showdown, Mr. Spencer, whose show, ''Vibe,'' is seen in New York City on WWOR, Channel 9, pulled out a congratulatory fruit basket sent him by Mr. Wayans. As he began his monologue, chomping on a plum, he collapsed as though poisoned.     There is another new show in the wings with the potential to draw a young, multiracial audience. The basketball legend Earvin (Magic) Johnson is now taping pilots for a late-night talk show he is developing with Twenthieth Television, the syndication division of Fox Studios. Called ''The Magic Hour,'' it is scheduled to begin early next year, ideally after either Mr. Wayans or Mr. Spencer has called it a night, those involved in the production whisper.     Of the two new hosts already on the air, 39-year-old Mr. Wayans, whose show is on WNYW, Channel 5, in New York, has the edge in terms of name recognition. He was the creator and star of the Emmy Award-winning comedy series ''In Living Color'' and has also had success in films, as a star of ''Hollywood Shuffle'' and as writer, director and star of ''A Low Down Dirty Shame.''     The set of his new show is a pastiche of shape and color: no desk, just a couple of modernist couches, a coffee table resembling a giant peanut and a sprawling fish tank that glows lavender. Mr. Wayans's sartorial tastes range from Flashy to bizarre. One night he sported a shiny black jumpsuit, another night a slinky chartreuse shirt, all topped off with clunky jewelry.     Despite the trappings, Mr. Wayans has an easy way about him. He seemed preternaturally calm on opening night in contrast to one of his guests, the actor Brendan Fraser, who nearly gulped with nervousness. And Mr. Wayans loves to coax his guests into talking about sex. Pamela Anderson Lee, the former star of ''Baywatch,'' volunteered that her libido knew no bounds now that she was pregnant.     ''Has pregnancy slowed you down?'' Mr. Wayans asked.     ''Your sex drive is through the roof,'' she exclaimed. ''There are no sharp corners on any of the furniture at home.''     Then there are the off-the-wall comedy sketches and mock commercials. A public-service announcement with the message ''Smoke: because holes in throats are pretty cool'' showed a nicotine-addicted grandmother blowing out birthday candles and playing a saxophone through her neck. Another, a takeoff on commercials for exercise contraptions, advertised the ''Sexerciser'' for $29.95, with vigorous demonstrations.     ''Keenen has a big following that loves and adores him, which is a great help,'' said Charlie Parsons, a British television producer who is collaborating on the show as an executive producer with Mr. Wayans and Eric L. Gold. '' 'In Living Color' was universal in its comedic appeal. This new show has a generational appeal. The target audience is younger and hipper. Everyone is welcome.''     Mr. Parsons said that while Mr. Leno's and Mr. Letterman's shows were ''incredibly well produced,'' he believed there was ''definitely an audience that isn't being serviced by them.''     The star of ''Vibe,'' 29-year-old Mr. Spencer, is after the same audience. ''We're just trying to add some flavor to the milk,'' he said in an interview. Many viewers ''left the whole late-night arena after Arsenio,'' he added. ''There are a bunch of artists who don't get the opportunities because of the style of music they play or the kinds of jokes they tell.''     While Mr. Spencer may not have a household name, the creator of his show, Quincy Jones, does. A musician, composer, and record and film producer who has won 26 Grammy Awards, Mr. Jones has styled the show on his three-year-old magazine, ''Vibe.''     His connections have given the scenes and on the screen. An executive producer, Daniel Kellison, helped start ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and before that spent eight years with Mr. Letterman. The director, Sandra Fullerton, held the same job with Mr. Hall from 1989 to 1994.     Mr. Jones appeared for 10 minutes at the start of the first show before handing it over to Mr. Spencer. in those few minutes, he schmoozed with President Clinton about America's youth in an appearance taped at the White House. Then Mr. Jones told viewers, ''No matter what your age or race or sex, 'Vibe,' will be an equal opportunity entertainer.''     The guests that night included Whoopi Goldberg, Brandy, Anthony Edwards of ''E.R.,'' the female rap group Salt-n-Pepa and, by satellite, Denzel Washington and Spike Lee.     The choice of the relatively unknown Mr. Spencer is not as odd as it seems. He is, after all, young, handsome and very funny. ''How often is a brother given an opportunity to go into a million homes and not be arrested?'' he quipped upon first taking the stage.     A peripatetic stand-up comic, Mr. Spencer, who favors expensive-looking, trendy jackets, has appeared on MTV, ''In Living Color'' and Mr. Hall's show. He also has close ties to the Wayans family. He had a starring role in the film ''Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,'' which Keenen Wayans produced. And in the publicity kit for ''Vibe,'' Mr. Spencer named Mr. Wayans's brother, Damon, the comedian and actor, as one of his role models, along with Jack Paar and Mohammed Ali.     Like ''The Keenan Ivory Wayans Show,'' ''Vibe'' strives for an integrated guest list. A recent show included the actress Demi Moore and the model Naomi Campbell. The studio audience is also integrated, roughly half white and half black. Only the musical guests seem one-dimensional, with the focus on rap and soul. But Mr. Spencer said he saw nothing wrong with that.     ''Hip-hop is now pop,'' he said. ''When you see Japanese kids getting their hair fried so it looks like an Afro and wearing pants falling off, that's not about acting black. That's about pop culture.''

When she performed an acoustic set with her band the Pretenders on Saturday night at Symphony Space, she went the way of many aging rock stars and  rearranged her songs to incorporate less noise and more strings. But to counter  the classical sheen that the Duke String Quartet brought to the concert, she had the ensemble scruffily groomed and dressed down in T-shirts and jeans. Furthermore, as the quartet scraped away virtuously on the right side of the stage, a skinny man who was introduced as Wif sat on a stool on the far left, occasionally rattling a tambourine, fulfilling a function anyone with a sense of rhythm could perform.         It is this contrast between the primitive and the sophisticated that has marked the Pretenders' career. The band originally rose from England's punk scene 17 years ago (with Ms. Hynde transplanted from Ohio), but soon proved that it had far more depth and ambition than its peers. As Ms. Hynde became a mother  of two and one of rock's pillars of strength and survival, two of her bandmates  died of drug overdoses.

But, then, from its inception onward, Christianity has never not been embattled; a hostile and scoffing world is where it knows itself to be situated, ''unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness.'' Though many theologies of false reasonableness have been offered down through the ages, Kierkegaard and Barth and Berdyaev and Unamuno in modern times have rooted the faith more securely than ever in its native soil of desperation.

T coalition launched what Mr. Reed said was a campaign putting more than $1 million into backing the contract. The first goal: the balanced budget amendment.    The alliance with Republicans is not surprising given that Republicans in Congress are much more powerful these days and ideologically closer to the coalition. And by campaigning for issues beyond its traditional purview of school prayer and abortion, the coalition is seeking to win respect as an organization that is broad in scope.

Cassidy doesn't plan to open a practice. His eyesight is poor -- he has cataracts -- and he is getting on in years: this October he will be 85.   But in Mr. Cassidy's view, this month's decision by the state's top court to allow him a law license does far more than that. It restores his reputation, he says, and redresses a ruling that banned him from his chosen profession 51 years ago. In 1944, an appellate court rejected Mr. Cassidy's application because as leader of an extreme right-wing Brooklyn group called the Christian Front, the court said, he urged the violent overthrow of the Government of the United States.

PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD;ALSO AROUND TOWN"},{"year":"1990","title":"Beckett Annotations   Samuel Beckett's well-thumbed rehearsal copy from the 1953 Paris production of \\"Waiting for Godot\\" is to be auctioned at Sotheby's in London at 11 A.M. on Thursday. The ink-stained author's version of this seminal work -- written in 1948-49, published in French in 1952 and performed first in Paris -- is missing its front cover and is marked on the title page in blue ballpoint, \\"prompt copy 1953.\\"    Beckett, who read the part of Pozzo in the first act during some rehearsals after the original actor had dropped out, noted his ideas for changes in dialogue and stage directions for Pozzo, Vladimir, Estragon and Lucky, writing in pencil and pen.  The annotations and insertions, ranging from a single word to several lines of dialogue, cover 30 pages of the play. The presale estimate for the Godot is $59,100 to $78,800.    In 1964, Beckett presented this Godot to his London publisher, John Calder, and his wife, Bettina Jonic.  \\"He gave it to me when he used to stay with me in London in the 1960's,\\" Mr. Calder said in a telephone interview last weekend from New Jersey while on a visit to this country. (When the Calders were divorcing, a British court ruled that the Godot had to be returned to Beckett, who then gave it to Mr. Calder). Mr. Calder is selling the Godot along with letters and cards from Beckett, 7 lots of corrected proofs of the author's poems and prose works and 22 contracts. \\"Unfortunately, it is all of the Beckett material -- all the correspondence and iconographic material,\\" he said.   Why is Mr. Calder selling his Beckett archive?   \\"Independent publishing is going through a tough time right now,\\" Mr. Calder said. \\"The problem is the big publishers have been swallowing up all the smaller ones.\\"    The presale estimate for the entire archive is $101,000 to $154,000.   Asked why the overall estimate appeared to be low, Peter Beal, a manuscripts specialist at Sotheby's London, said yesterday from his office: \\"It doesn't seem low to us. For a marked-up play its got to be pretty special to spend tens of thousands. If you had the full working manuscript, that would be something else.\\"  Rochas Furnishings     Helene Rochas's blue lacquer room in her Paris home is to be redecorated without the Art Deco furnishings the fashion designer collected in the 1960's and 70's. The contents of the room -- 37 chairs, tables, lamps and accessories by Pierre Legrain, Eileen Gray and Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann -- are to be auctioned at 2:30 P.M. on Sunday at the Hotel Metropole Palace in Monte Carlo by Christie's .   In the sale, which is expected to bring in a total of $925,000 to $1 million, the outstanding piece is a 1923 African-inspired lacquered wood stool by Pierre Legrain. Mrs. Rochas paid $19,696 for it at the 1972 Paris sale of the collection of the couturier Jacques Doucet","excerpt":"Christie's expects it to sell for $60,000 to $80,000.    Two exotic pieces of furniture by Miss Gray -- a lacquered wood sofa expected to bring $140,000 to $180,000 and a rosewood veneered bench ($60,000 to $80,000) -- are also African in spirit. Ruhlmann's \\"Antilope,\\" a silvered-bronze mirror of circular design on a horn-shaped base, made between 1923 and 1928, is expected to bring $8,000 to $12,000.   \\"Ruhlmann gave them as New Year's presents to architects and decorators -- people who brought him business,\\" said Olivier Brommet, a Christie's Art Deco specialist in London.  Harrison Memorabilia     Rex Harrison's performance as Uninvited Guest in T. S. Eliot's \\"Cocktail Party,\\" a role the actor created, is recalled in a copy of the play, signed by the author and dedicated to Harrison, that is to be auctioned at 2 P.M. on Thursday at William Doyle Galleries in Manhattan. The play, which is expected by Doyle to bring $600 to $800, is among 185 items of the actor's library, wardrobe and collection of theatrical memorabilia from his New York apartment. Proceeds of the sale, expected to total $63,000 to $93,000, are to benefit the Sir Rex Harrison drama scholarship at Boston University.   Sir Rex, a man who improved every hat he wore, left many hats, including a group in next week's sale: one top hat and eight tweed-plaid featherless numbers, of the kind called \\"the Rex Harrison hat.\\" Doyle's presale estimate is $100 to $200 for the lot.   Asked why so many hats were included in the estimate, Doyle's president, Michael J. Shay, said the presale figure did not reflect \\"celebrity value, which is highly subjective.\\"   He added, \\"We prefer to be conservative and let the bidders determine the values as they see them.\\" 13th-Century Bestiary     A 13th-century English bestiary -- a book about real and imaginary animals -- abundantly illustrated with 112 colored-ink drawings on vellum, was sold last Friday at Sotheby's in London for $5.85 million, the second-highest price at auction for any manuscript.    The buyer of the Northumberland Bestiary, Nicholas Poole-Wilson of Bernard Quaritch, a London dealer, would not say whom he was representing.    \\"I can't comment on the purchase, but I can comment on the manuscript,\\" Mr. Poole-Wilson said by telephone after the sale. \\"It is prime medieval art, the English bestiary at its best. The bestiary was a very English phenomenon, particularly in the 13th century. Only about 40 survive.\\"   Christopher de Hamel, who heads Sotheby's sales of Western manuscripts in London, said the 148-page manuscript was the last English bestiary recorded in private hands and the first to come to auction in 101 years. It was sold by the 11th Duke of Northumberland from Alnwick castle, where the manuscript had been since the 18th century.   \\"We have not been told why he is selling anything,\\" said D'Estey Bond, a Sotheby's press spokeswoman. She added that he was selling some antiquities and documents in next week's sales. WILLIAM DOYLE, 175 East 87th Street, (212) 427-2730.

Here is a most curious example of the adaptation of a classic being more somber than the text from which it was adapted. Because we always like to think of ourselves as more sophisticated now than we were six weeks ago (to say nothing of 200 years ago), it usually works the other way around.Diderot's \\"La Religieuse,\\" written in 1760 but not published until 1796, had its origins as an elaborate and rather cruel practical joke, as a series of letters written by Diderot to his friend, the Marquis de Croismare, who had earlier assisted a certain Sister Suzanne Simonin in her unsuccessful suit to have her vows revoked. Attempting to lure his friend back to Paris from his country estate, Diderot, in the letters, represented himself as Sister Suzanne, newly escaped from her convent and in need of the marquis's aid.In addition to the letters, Diderot also composed a journal, supposedly kept by Sister Suzanne, in which she recounted how she had been forced into the nunnery by her family, had been coerced into taking her vows, had been tortured when she resisted the hair shirts and the whips, and had memorized the order's constitution to become, in effect, a nunnery lawyer.Things went no better for Sister Suzanne when she was finally transferred to another convent, which was run by a mad mother superior, a pretty, pudgy-faced lesbian, and where the sisters drank liqueurs, munched sweets and shrieked up and down the cloistered corridors, blowing kisses to one another. With the help of an erring monk, Sister Suzanne leaped over the wall one night to meet a death more precipitous than fate might reasonably have been expected to impose, principally because Diderot realized that the Marquis de Croismare had taken the joke seriously and was preparing to come to the sister's rescue.\\"La Religieuse\\" was not as much an exposé of convent life—though it came to be known as that—as it was a romantic polemic on tyranny, written in the extravagant terms that its author knew would most fascinate and upset the good marquis. Even today it is quite out-rageous, as when, for example, Sister Suzanne and the crazy mother superior stage what amounts to a slapstick battle over Sister Suzanne's virtue, so amazingly well preserved that Samuel Richardson's Pamela would have been proud to call it her own.There is, however, behind all of the extravagances of \\"La Religieuse\\" the straightforward progression of tragedy, and it's this progression, this movement towards an inexorable fate, that Rivette's film details with almost classic simplicity. \\"The Nun\\" is theatrical, without in any way being uncinematic, beginning as if it were a ritual, or a play, the stage of which is the chapel where Sister Suzanne (Anna Karina) makes her first dramatic refusal to take the vows, and then is led away, crying, by the older, completely implacable brides of Christ. There are hardly any exterior shots in the film, but even the few exteriors have the sealed, exitless feeling of the convent interiors.Miss Karina's beauty, for which Godard once made movies that were also homages, is the perfect centerpiece for a film that looks cool and graceful but is passionately determined with the heart of a revolutionary. It's a lovely performance, one that never condescends to play on pathos but grows in strength with each new outrage so that the final, very wild moments of the film have the kind of conviction that transforms melodrama into something a good deal more important.The cast also includes Liselotte Pulver, Micheline Presle and Francine Berge, as mother superiors of varying degrees of correctness","excerpt":"Christine Lernier, as Sister Suzanne's real mother, who dismisses her daughter with the cheery reminder that \\"my fate in the hereafter depends on you,\\" and Francisco Rabal, as the monk who, with love, successfully dooms Sister Suzanne.Rivette and Jean Gruault (who also wrote Godard's \\"Les Carabiniers\\" and Truffaut's \\"The Wild Child\\"), did the excellent adaptation, which, not so incidentally, has taken a long time to get here. The film, which opened yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema, was made in 1965, banned for a while by the French Government for reasons that were patently absurd, and then shown twice at the 1968 New York Film Festival.
