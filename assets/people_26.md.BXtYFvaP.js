For the situations described in this essay, I have to invent conventions -- s/he and his/her -- to denote someone who is neither male nor female or who is perhaps both sexes at once. Legally, too, every adult is either man or woman, and the difference is not trivial. It means being available for, or exempt from, draft registration, as well as being subject to laws governing marriage, the family and human intimacy.   But if the state and the legal system have an interest in maintaining a two-party sexual system, they are defying nature.

The river sets the pace in this semi&#8208;tropical region. Life is lived more slowly. One seeks cool shade from the hot sun in the afternoon or welcomes fresh Gulf breeze that pushes the sticky humidity back a little; a tequila or rum drink is meant to be sipped slowly at sundown. However, there is an undercurrent of activity below the placid surface: a burgeoning tourism industry. For many years Texans have been going to &#8220;the valley,&#8221; as it is colloquially known, for deep&#8208;sea fishing off the coast or white&#8208;winged dove shooting in the cornfields and meadows of northern Mexico. In 1967, Hurricane Beulah leveled the area, blowing away most of the tacky old wooden fishing shacks and resorts. Faced with a clean slate, developers began thinking about upgrading tourist facilities, paticularly on Padre Island. They've taken their time about it, carefully building while maintaining much of the natural surroundings and promoting the area as a vacation and retirement center. It must be working, because more and more tourists are coming to the valley during the winter in cars bearing Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and other Midwestern license plates. Residents say the valley will &#8220;boom like Florida,&#8221; but I think the region is just inaccessible enough to keep from exploding in a wave of concrete highrises and trailer parks that would push prices out of the reach of the middle class.

Jick feels betrayed and confused by Alex's decision. In fact, Jick's summer as portrayed by Ivan Doig (author of ''This House of Sky,'' nominated in 1978 for the National Book Award in contemporary thought) is filled with confusion and anxiety. He's just beginning to notice girls; a number of deadly forest fires are breaking out (and his father, a forest ranger, must battle the deadliest fire of all); the eagerly-anticipated Fourth of July dance turns into a brawl (with Jick participating); and a mysterious, grizzled old cowboy named Stanley suddenly appears and keeps appearing in Jick's life. Two things make this nostalgic western novel especially delightful: old Jick's idiosyncratic theories (thrown in, as he reminisces, whenever he darn well pleases) about everything from in-laws to General Custer; and young Jick's reluctance to come of age, coupled with his precocious understanding that that's exactly what he's doing.

FIRST GREAT TRIUMPH: How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power, by Warren Zimmermann. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) A career diplomat examines the decade of American expansionism that began with the Spanish-American War and ran through Theodore Roosevelt's presidency, and the lives of five men who helped create a global empire: Roosevelt, Alfred T. Mahan, Henry Cabot Lodge, John Hay and Elihu Root. In 2002 our reviewer, David Nasaw, called this a ''brilliantly readable book.''    THE RURAL LIFE, by Verlyn Klinkenborg. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.) This collection of essays from The Times and a few other publications is organized as a month-by-month journey through the year, chronicling the seasonal demands and serendipities of life on the author's farm in upstate New York, with side trips to New England and the West. The result is ''a work of almost uninterrupted felicity,'' Rob Nixon wrote here in 2002. Klinkenborg's voice ''manages to sound both intimate . . . and consequential.''    GILLIGAN'S WAKE, by Tom Carson. (Picador, $14.) Exasperating, uneven but infused with a trashy exuberance, this pastiche of a novel looks at 20th-century American history through the lives of the castaways on ''Gilligan's Island,'' with the likes of Holden Caulfield and Jean-Paul Sartre rubbing elbows with Gilligan (or ''Gil''), the Skipper, the Professor and the rest of the crew. ''Carson's prose often has the energy of a song by his beloved Ramones,'' David Kelly wrote in the Book Review last year. ''A reference to Clare Boothe Luce can sit alongside an allusion to Nabokov and be just as meaningful, or meaningless.''    SET THIS HOUSE IN ORDER: A Romance of Souls, by Matt Ruff. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $14.95.) Andrew and Penny both suffer from multiple personality syndrome but manage to function as employees of a virtual-reality start-up outside Seattle. When Andrew comes undone, however, he sets off with Penny (and the 100 or so clamoring souls in his head) to his childhood home in Michigan. The result is an ''irresistible'' novel that is an ''odyssey of transformation and trust,'' Kerry Fried wrote in these pages in 2003.    DRINKING COFFEE ELSEWHERE, by ZZ Packer. (Riverhead, $14.) The people in this debut collection of short stories form a constellation of young, black experience, particularly the women in several tales who struggle through layers of stereotypes and expectations to make their presence felt in the world. ''The obstacles to achieving identity are more complicated than the obvious ones, such as our grievous racial history,'' Jean Thompson wrote in these pages in 2003. Packer displays ''the old-time religion of storytelling,'' though her prose ''supplies plenty of the edge and energy we expect from contemporary fiction.''    GIRL MEETS GOD: A Memoir, by Lauren F. Winner. (Random House, $13.95.) Tracing the seismic shifts in her religious life, the author, whose father was Jewish and her mother a ''lapsed Southern Baptist,'' tells of how she made the decision as a young woman to convert from Orthodox Judaism to evangelical Christianity. This ''is a passionate and thoroughly engaging account of a continuing spiritual journey within two profoundly different faiths,'' Reeve Lindbergh wrote in the Book Review in 2002.    WHEN HARLEM NEARLY KILLED KING: The 1958 Stabbing of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., by Hugh Pearson. (Seven Stories, $11.95.) In a little-known incident, a deranged Harlem woman, raging against the 29-year-old King and the N.A.A.C.P., nearly killed him with a letter opener as he sat for photographers. Pearson's account ''skillfully examines a brief but crucial moment, illuminating the unsteady beginnings of the civil rights revolution,'' Nia-Malika Henderson said here in 2002.

And, once again, the British provided a number of splendid demonstrations that television can, at least occasionally, rise above audience-research studies and tiresome sex-and-violence tactics. \\n\\nThe year's most outstanding production is undoubtedly ''The Jewel in the Crown,'' a 15-hour dramatization of Paul Scott's ''Raj Quartet,'' currently being presented Sunday evenings at 9 on public television's Masterpiece Theater. Spanning five years, from 1942 to the eve of India's independence in 1947, the story uses dozens of major characters to explore the complex love/hate relationship between England and the India that once was described by Disraeli as the jewel in the crown of her empire. Filmed largely in India, it is a production rich in intriguing character studies and exceptional acting. Two actresses virtually unknown is this country give stunning performances: Susan Wooldridge as the doomed Daphne Manners, and Geraldine James as the quietly independent Sarah Layton. Tim Pigott-Smith as the villainous Ronald Merrick and Art Malik as the lost Hari Kumar are little short of perfect. And Peggy Ashcroft is a marvel to watch as an elderly former missionary who begins disintegrating under the burden of the colonialist mentality. The veteran actress is also starring in another story about India, the current film ''A Passage of India,'' and is certain to have her distinguished career crowned with a slew of major awards in 1985.

Rock of the 1990's is shaping up as a polymorphous mess -- dozens of categories and subgenres and recombinations -- with a core of genuine innovation and surprising seriousness. While shallow commercial pop and lovers' ballads will never disappear, they're not alone amid the gold and platinum albums","excerpt":"alongside them is music that takes chances and overhauls conventions to speak from the heart. The best 1990's rock (a term I'll use to encompass hip-hop, dance music and the rest of the mess) often rejects prettiness, but it has the severe beauty of passion inventing its own structures. It also has the kind of visceral kick that puts bodies in motion and demands a reaction, the way rock should. It's Noisy! It's New! It's 90's!"},{"year":"1995","title":"Alonna Michele Ostrow, a daughter of Batsheva and Ronald Ostrow of Old Westbury, L.I., was married last evening to Dr. Michael Ostad, a son of Soraya Ostad and Dr. Abraham Ostad, also of Old Westbury.

The Cameo, with its \\"Three Songs About Lenin,\\" undertakes the canonization of the late Russian leader and sings the triumphs of communism. The Gaiety, with \\"Man of Courage,\\" does pretty much the same for Mussolini and fascism. Each being frankly a propagandizing film, their reception is likely to depend on individual susceptibility to the creeds they espouse. Thus far the Fascists and the capitalists have raised no objection to the Russian film","excerpt":"already the American League Against War and Fascism has proclaimed that the exhibition of the Italian film is an \\"outrage.\\"Its story outlined by Premier Mussolini and filmed with the support of the Italian Government, \\"Man of Courage\\" attempts to depict the progress of Italy from 1914 to the present. It attributes that progress, not without reason, to the emergence of Italy's man of courage—Benito Mussolini. Against the historical backdrop, the producers have assembled their cast—a poor Italian family—and it is through their eyes and their words that the panorama of Italian development is seen and heard.The film is divided into three periods: the pre-war and war years; war's aftermath, with Italy ravaged by strikes, turmoil and poverty; the development of the Black Shirt movement, the march on Rome, the swelling sound of tractor and dynamo, culminating in a vision of Roman ascendance with a new Caesar leading his legions of peace and of war into the paths of glory.Moving sluggishly at first, the picture gains speed and vitality during the second half of the second period and throughout the third. The cameras turn from newsreel material to the staged drama of the peasant family in the Pontine marshes, connecting scattered incidents into a cohesive whole and not forgetting for a moment its central theme—the glorification of the Italian leader. And not forgetting, either, to propagandize against the Communists, who are shown buying votes, destroying property, blocking progress, in fact, doing most of the things the Communists assign to capitalists and Fascists in their own pictures.This frank idolatry of Mussolini is likely to prove one of the chief obstacles to popular approval of the picture here. As a posthumous eulogy it might be accepted; today it bears too obviously the brand of sycophancy. Even members of yesterday's predominantly Italian-American audience appeared to grow restive under the film's continued prostrations before the master.On the whole, \\"Man of Courage\\" suffers from overlength (its running time is nearly two hours), from its obviously one-sided (propagandizing and from the woodenness of some of its peasant actors. It is not entertainment in the Broadway sense, but it is interesting in its attempt to give a pictorial history of modern Italy. The sound dubbing, whereby the remarks of the Italian players roll forth in perfect English, is skilfully done and fine performances are contributed by Carlo Manenti, Tonino Villani and Signor Mussolini himself.

Mr. Rogers attended Trinity School in New York (class of '52), and received his Bachelor of Arts from Yale University ('55) and his LLB from New York University Law School ('59). He was a Reporter for the N.Y. Journal of Commerce while attending law school. He joined the firm of Burlingham Underwood and Lord in 1959 where he became a senior partner, practicing admiralty and international law. Mr. Rogers opened branch offices (the first Western law firm) in Saudi Arabia","excerpt":"also in Kuwait and Egypt. He formed the American-Saudi Business Roundtable in the 70's to promote U.S.-Saudi business partnerships. In 1990, Mr. Rogers launched the Build America initiative to seize for the American economy a share of the booming foreign-flag cruise ship industry. The prototype ship, America World City, will be the world's largest passenger ship, accommodating 6,200 guests. Mr. Rogers is survived by three sons, John S. Rogers, Jr., Roland K.

World City America Inc. celebrates the life and work of its Chairman and Chief Executive, John S. Rogers. A visionary, an optimist, a highly intelligent and methodical man, he undertook, starting in 1989, to develop an American-flag cruise ship industry. His vision was an American-built and U.S-flag operated fleet of next - generation cruise ships -- city - ships -- which would seize for the American economy a share of the booming foreign-dominated cruise ship industry. The prototype city-ship, to be named America World City--The Westin Flagship, will accommodate 6,200 guests and will be the world's largest passenger ship by a significant margin. The construction of the city-ship will be a major stimulus for the rebuilding of the hurricane - devastated southern tier of the country, creating thousands of jobs and benefiting local economies through community participation programs. For over sixteen years, and with an investment of over $50million, World City America Inc., under Mr. Rogers' leadership, and with the support of hundreds of American corporations who stand to benefit from an American-flag presence in this $16-billion-ayear, foreign-dominated industry, has positioned the United States to enter the market with a superior product, capable of being built in the U.S. at an internationally competitive price, creating thousands of long-term selfsupporting jobs on the ship and ashore, and promising renewed economic prosperity for the coastal communities across the southern tier. For those of us who have worked side-by-side with this wonderful man for so many years, our loss is indescribable; but our purpose is noble and it will be all the more rewarding to accomplish it in his honor.     $(6$)ROGERS -- John Stratford. World City Foundation mourns the loss of its beloved Chairman and Chief Executive. Mr. Rogers' concept, to harness a major capital asset (world's largest passenger ship) as a source of perpetual funding for the attainment of the Foundation's goals, reflects a growing trend among world business organizations toward assuming a more active role in creating a healthier society and a more habitable planet. World City Foundation will carry out its educational, cultural, recreational and public policy programs and activities on board the 255,000-ton vessel, America World City-The Westin Flagship, and the profits of the ship's operations will be channeled into worthwhile programs and activities throughout the country and the world, including education, environmental protection, sustainable development, corporate responsibility, international understanding, and medical research. We have had the privilege and honor to work with a man whose vision inspired us, encouraged us, taught us, and enabled us to carry on, even without him.

The warm, inviting ocean saturated me with calm and peace and tranquillity. I stayed longer and longer, far after sunset. It was cooling down quite a bit. Finally I realized I was staying in the water longer simply for fear of how cold I would be when I got out! I had no towel or clothes with me, and my bungalow was set back away from the beach.
