J. Simpson on the  back. Inside, the jacket tells us, you'll find details of Mr. Stern's secret meeting with Michael Jackson and his pact with Adolf Hitler, as well as 40 pictures of naked breasts, so there is little point in discussing the literary merits here. But what readers may take for granted is the book's design, a complex melange of typographic hierarchies. It is a remarkable display of deconstructive, post-structural, post-modern experimentation -- or to put it simply for the layman, words explode across the page. The text and binding were  designed by Chip Kidd and Nina Gaskin","excerpt":"the jacket and the inserted color section were designed by Jack Heller (no relation) and Ralph Cirella. Each of the 482 pages is a distinct design experience. But this kind of expressive typography is not new. In 1918 Guillaume Apollinaire published an antiwar poem, \\"Il Pleut,\\" with lines of type falling down the page simulating a rainstorm; in 1914 F. T. Marinetti wrote and designed the Futurist book \\"Zang Tumb Tuuuum,\\" using discordant typefaces designed to visually approximate the sounds that he described in words; and in 1967 Quentin Fiore gave a visual voice to Marshall McLuhan's \\"Medium Is the Massage\\" through a rebuslike integration of word and image complemented by shifts in typographic size and weight. In 1970 Mr. Fiore brought the same kinetic type and page design to Jerry Rubin's book \\"Do It!,\\" to which \\"Miss America\\" owes a distinct debt. Unfortunately, \\"Miss America\\" really  doesn't go as far as some of these books. While the design shouts and screams, by the standards of other 20th-century books it is actually pretty timid.

The bill for that extravagance last year was paid, according to Japanese press reports, by Harunori Takahashi, who at the time was head of a credit union. The lavish entertainment was a factor in the credit union's bankruptcy and in Mr. Nakajima's resignation from the Finance Ministry in July.

BANKING  New Week, New Merger  Forging a combination that would dominate banking in metropolitan Philadelphia, Core states Financial agreed to acquire Meridian Bancorp for $3.2 billion in stock.

Two of his lawyers said shortly afterward that Mr. Austin, above right, had been pardoned by the ruler of Dubai, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.

Pinchas Zukerman Extends Contract in Ottawa  Pinchas Zukerman, who touched off a furor by saying he needed a rest and then taking a sudden sabbatical last December from his post as music director of the National Arts Center Orchestra in Ottawa, has extended his contract at least until 2011, the orchestra announced yesterday. Mr. Zukerman, left, who was appointed in 1999, broke his silence about his departure in January, when he referred to ''a few rotten apples'' that ascend to prominence in every orchestra and ''create an atmosphere that has to be eradicated, quite frankly.'' Jayne Watson, the orchestra's director of communications, called the remarks ''intemperate.'' Mr. Zukerman returned a month earlier than planned, to lead the orchestra in concerts in May. Yesterday, the orchestra said the renewal of his contract was approved unanimously by the board, and Mr. Zukerman, in a statement, said, ''Thanks to the dedication of my orchestra colleagues, we have been able to make a difference across Canada by reaching out to new and diverse communities to introduce them to the power and magic of music.''    Chomsky Publisher Charged in Turkey  Fatih Tas, the Turkish publisher of a book by the American intellectual Noam Chomsky, said yesterday that he and two of his colleagues were facing prison sentences as long as six years on charges of ''denigrating national identity'' and ''inciting hatred,'' Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Tas, owner of the Aram Publishing House, said that he and his colleagues Omer Faruk Kurhan and Taylan Tosun had been charged over the book ''Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media,'' written by Mr. Chomsky, right, and Edward S. Herman, which argues that corporate and government pressures distort news coverage. Mr. Tas said that Ender Abadoglu, the translator of the book, published in Turkey in March, was also likely to be indicted. Mr. Tas was tried and acquitted in 2002 for publishing ''American Interventionism,'' a collection of essays by Mr. Chomsky that included criticism of the Turkish government's treatment of its Kurdish minority and of American arms sales to Turkey. The European Union has warned Turkey that prosecution of intellectuals and writers is harmful to its bid for membership.    Americans in Paris  A statue of Thomas Jefferson and a portrait of Rosa Parks were unveiled yesterday in Independence Day observances in Paris attended by its mayor, Bertrand Delanoë, and by the mayor of Washington, Anthony Williams, Agence France-Presse reported. The statue of Jefferson, who drafted the Declaration of Independence, represented the United States in France from 1785 to 1789, became the first American secretary of state and served as the third president, is at the approach to a pedestrian bridge across the Seine next to the Musée d'Orsay.

B. B. King Bids Farewell at Montreux  The blues guitarist and songwriter B. B. King, 80, ailing and on a final tour of Europe, bade an emotional farewell to fans at a concert that stretched into the early hours yesterday at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, where he has performed for more than 20 years, Reuters reported. At the end of the two-and-a-half-hour concert in the resort town on Lake Geneva, Mr. King, above, who suffers from diabetes, was saluted by performers who joined him onstage. Among those paying tribute were the singers Gladys Knight, Barbara Hendricks, Randy Crawford and Leela James","excerpt":"the jazz guitarists John McLaughlin and Stanley Clarke; the keyboarders Joe Sample and George Duke, and the saxophonist David Sanborn. ''Maybe I should quit every night,'' said Mr. King, a winner of 14 Grammy Awards.

B., you are an honorary citizen of Montreux; this is your second home.''    Hungary's Envoy Rocks  Andras Simonyi, Hungary's ambassador to the United States, traveled from Washington to Westminster, Md., yesterday to play blues at Common Ground on the Hill, Reuters reported. Attended by more than 300 people, Common Ground is an institute that offers classes in traditional arts and music, from the African roots of the concept ''cool'' to bluegrass banjo. Mr. Simonyi, who said he hoped to play guitar with rockers in the Bush administration, was born in 1952 and credits rock with giving him a vital connection to the outside world during the Communist era in Hungary. ''When I was listening to rock music, I became part of the West,'' he said. ''This was a link to the free world.'' When he came to Washington as ambassador in 2002, he formed a band called Coalition of the Willing, including Jeff Baxter, formerly of Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers; Lincoln P. Bloomfield Jr., former assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs; and Alexander Vershbow, United States ambassador to South Korea. Mr. Simonyi said he had spoken to the White House chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, and spokesman, Tony Snow, both musicians, about a White House concert.    China Bans Korean Film  China has banned South Korea's leading box-office movie because of subtle gay themes, Reuters reported yesterday. An executive with the South Korean entertainment company CJ said from its Beijing office that the film, ''King and the Clown,'' about a tyrannical ruler and his two court jesters, right, was denied distribution permission because of sexually explicit language and China's sensitivity to homosexuality, considered a mental disorder as recently as 2001. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, however, that the company had been authorized to sell the film on DVD. ''King and the Clown,'' which took in about $85 million and sold about 12 million tickets in South Korea, has no sex scenes involving the king and the jesters, but a romance is implied. China's film censorship authority was not available for comment.

On the other hand, changing times may now be altering the insider's traditional image of the very young dancer who remains the perpetual student. Memoirs such as those by the Russian ballerina Tamara Karsavina have always suggested the passage from the classroom to professional dancing to be only one of degree.  As full members of a state company, dancers like Karsavina continued to rehearse and take class day in and day out in the very studios in which they had grown up and been hermetically enclosed since childhood. The formative and early professional years of young dancers no wadays tend to be quite, even brutally, different.

Its very existence -- never mind its specific policies -- would break the institutional gridlock that has paralyzed Washington for most of the past 20 years. Ultimately, it would give us a more parliamentary style of government, in keeping, it seems to me, with what the Founding Fathers had in mind. Perot demonstrated the possibility.

But in this well-organized and fascinating movie, the tidy and intelligent filmmakers Megan Mylan and Jon Shenk follow the accretions of small defeats that don't sap the will of the young Africans transplanted to the United States to make a better life for themselves. &quot;You are the future of Sudan,&quot; the boys are told as they prepare to leave their homeland. The film, which primarily follows two of the boys, Peter and Santino, over the course of a year, doesn't make us dread that line about a heaven that may not materialize. At its core, &quot;Sudan&quot; becomes about coping with loneliness, as alienation increases and both young men — like their newly arrived tribesmen — are orphaned into trying to stay afloat. Hearing the African teenagers joke about the customs they can no longer observe — like the familiar touching considered homosexual behavior in America — only italicizes the spiritual distance between America and Africa. The nearly unlimited access the directors have to the lives of their subjects intensifies the narrative, because it allows us to drift along in the swells and eddies of Peter and Santino's time in the United States. The filmmakers don't shy away from touchy issues, like the schism between the Sudanese and American blacks. Subtly, &quot;Lost Boys of Sudan&quot; provides a sense of what its subjects have traded — sacrificed, really — to come to America. Getting an audience so caught up is no small feat, and a tribute to the directors' storytelling. And though that early reference to heaven on earth — hovering and poised for contradiction — is answered by the end of &quot;Sudan,&quot; by then the film has earned the right to do so. — Elvis Mitchell Coping in a Land That's Not Quite Heaven"},{"year":"1953","title":"IN the spring of 1800, a jovial preacher, Josiah Talltatters, with his nephew, Jeremiah, and his horse, Pilgrim, set out from Philadelphia and followed the wilderness roads west.

That's how  Robert James Waller starts \\"The Bridges of Madison County,\\" and we could sit around for a long time wondering just what that means. (Is blue-eyed grass more  sensitive than hazel-eyed grass?) But let's not. Mr. Waller's jabberwocky prose is surely not the secret of his book's bizarre success.         Still, any novel that has been on the best-seller list for nearly three years has hit some cultural nerve. Oddly, the romantic story in \\"Bridges\\" is not what  hits that nerve, either. The novel lures readers with its tale of the passionate four-day love affair between Francesca Johnson, a lonely farm wife, and Robert Kincaid, a lone-wolf photographer. But under this romantic gloss lurks the book's buried message, and the key to its immense popularity: \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" is really about the nobility of living an ordinary life. It is about renouncing grand passion in favor of being a wife and mother, as Francesca does. The story of Francesca and Robert would have been a lot less popular if they had run off together or if she had thrown herself under a train. The book's message is reassuring to readers who have renounced their own great passions, and even more reassuring to those who have never found any.

Mr. Radosh and Miss Milton conclude that Julius Rosenberg was a spy, that Ethel Rosenberg knew it and may have assisted him and that the prosecution took liberties with the facts and with legal procedures in its drive for conviction and execution. Definitive though their work may be, it is too much to hope that it will satisfy those who have invested faith and reputation either in the innocence of the Rosenbergs or in the justice of their execution. The case confirms yet again a grim axiom of history: The flames of ideology cannot be subdued by facts.   It was ideology that sent the Rosenbergs to their deaths in 1953. In that period of cold war and Korea, emotions ran high against these two Communists who, unlike most of those being badgered by Congressional committees, were actually charged with a crime.

Maybe that's because it's a tale so stark and powerful that it has assumed an air of timelessness, something almost mythical: Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black kid born and raised in Chicago, went down in August 1955 to visit some relatives in the hamlet of Money, Miss. One day, he walked into a country store there, Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market, and, on a dare, said something fresh to the white woman behind the counter -- 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant, the owner's wife -- or asked her for a date, or maybe wolf-whistled at her. A few nights later, her husband, Roy Bryant, and his half brother, J.W. Milam, yanked young Till out of bed and off into the dark Delta, where they beat, tortured and, ultimately, shot him in the head and pushed him into the Tallahatchie River.

As soon as they settled down to farming and village life, they began making and drinking wine. After a hard day in the fields of barley, a cup of cheer may have relieved the stress of living in an increasingly complex society.          That was some 7,400 years ago, and archeologists examining residues in an old clay jar from the Zagros Mountains of present-day Iran have found chemical traces of this Neolithic vintage. It is the earliest known evidence for winemaking, giving wine an extra 1,500 to 2,000 years of history. Tests at the University of Pennsylvania, reported last week, revealed chemicals considered proof that the vessel contained wine, and traces of resin as a preservative. This means the ancient vintage probably tasted like the Greek retsina of today.

We have the case of Ken Willis, the place-kicker, and the Dallas Cowboys, who got kicked. A week ago, Willis informed his team of last season, the Cowboys, that, as a Plan B free agent, he was accepting an offer of almost $1 million for two years to kick for Tampa Bay.

The Chiefs produced the league's best record by mastering that art. Whether it was a blocked kick or a made one, a fumble recovery or an interception returned for a touchdown or even a tricky 2-point conversion, the Chiefs seemed destined for something big. Their fans thought so. The Chiefs did, too.         So, when Lin Elliott entered today's game against the Indianapolis Colts with 37 seconds remaining and the Colts leading by 10-7, this game was certainly going into overtime, right? Forget that Elliott had missed a field-goal attempt  from 35 yards in the second quarter and then one from 36 yards with 10 minutes 36 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Forget that this one would be longer, from 43 yards. For this one was to keep the dream alive, to improve on the Chiefs' 13-3 record. To keep home-field advantage in the American Conference playoffs and to play host to the Pittsburgh Steelers next week for the A.F.C. championship. That's what this Elliott kick would be about, to extend this game  and to set the table for the Chiefs in overtime.

He recounted stories of earlier famines and plagues, of successful general theories and failed nostrums. The shepherd cautioned that there were no easy cures for a febrile sheep - a lean but not starvation diet was the proven remedy.

Whatever the evils of the Government were, in the performing arts (as in chess and mathematics), there was something almost otherworldly about Soviet achievements, particularly in contrast with the confused and messy world of democratic culture. For all the Communist rhetoric, musicians often seemed to possess the aura of the czars, the tradition of the Orthodox Church and the insight of the great Russian novelists. Now, we know, with the disintegration of central authority, the cultural scene is more like something out of the natural world, with each organization struggling for survival. Group after group comes to these shores hungry for certification, recognition and Western currency.   But on Sunday afternoon and Monday night in Avery Fisher Hall, when the Kirov Orchestra of St. Petersburg was conducted by Valery Gergiyev, its music director, the two programs of Russian orchestral music brought back memories of those earlier days. In July, the orchestra was heard as part of the Kirov Opera, which made a strong impression at the Metropolitan Opera House led by Mr. Gergiyev, flirting a bit with Western-style opera production, but offering glimpses of idiomatic singing and robust interpretation. These concerts went further: Mr. Gergiyev and the Kirov ensemble are clearly among the premier representatives of the formerly thriving Russian performing tradition.

They are small, from 1 to 3 inches in diameter, depending upon their sensitivity. Gyroscopes work on the principle of the Sagnac interferometer, which measures the interference of light waves. A single beam of near-infrared light is optically split into two beams of identical wavelength. Each beam is sent the opposite way through a tightly wound spool of fiber-optic wire. Changes in the rotation of the spool mean one beam must travel farther than the other, which causes them to interfere with each other. This can be measured by the interferometer","excerpt":"the larger the interference, the greater the rotational change.

But for everyone else, salivating over the lifestyles of the rich and supercilious, revenge is the pleasure of observing spoiled, glittering ninnies make fools of themselves. Few filmmakers have skewered their wretched excesses with the gleeful satirical eye of the director GREGORY LA CAVA (1892-1952), whose work is the focus of a 25-film MUSEUM OF MODERN ART retrospective. The series, which continues through Aug. 15, spans his career from the silent cartoons he made of popular comic strips to his early-1940's movies starring Irene Dunne. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9400, www.moma.org.    A master of screwball comedy, La Cava is best-known for the 1936 film ''MY MAN GODFREY'' (shown Aug. 1), in which William Powell plays a down-at-the-heels gentleman discovered living in a city dump by dizzy socialites on a scavenger hunt","excerpt":"the last item on the list of things to be brought home is ''a forgotten man.'' Irene Bullock (Carole Lombard), the nicer and zanier of two competing sisters, impulsively hires him to be the family butler and promptly falls in love with him.    Under its surface fun, the film's portrait of the Bullocks and their circle is a needling satire of the idle rich. Frivolous, neurotic and frequently drunk, they haven't a shred of social awareness. The Bullock sisters (Gail Patrick is Cornelia, the nastier one) are as vapid and annoying a pair of overprivileged playgirls as Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie playing milkmaids.    The 1939 comedy ''FIFTH AVENUE GIRL,'' which reversed the outsider's gender, starred Ginger Rogers as a homeless woman bribed by a millionaire to pose as a gold digger. Other outstanding movies in the series include ''SMART WOMAN'' (1931, with Mary Astor), the racy ''HALF-NAKED TRUTH'' (1932 with Lupe Velez as an exotic dancer), and ''STAGE DOOR'' (1937, with Katharine Hepburn), the adaptation of the Edna Ferber-George S.

But company executives say that in all their years of running a business they have never faced a debtor as recalcitrant as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.   Zerand delivered equipment late last year to two Soviet factories that make food containers, one in Minsk and the other in Kishinev. The company says it has since spent $20,000 on lawyers for dunning letters, but it has not received any of the $32 million promised in its contract with Tekhnoeksport, a Moscow foreign trade organization.   The first payments were due in September","excerpt":"the last payments at the end of 1990. A Year's Worth of Sales     \\"We've written a lot of letters, but we haven't gotten any response,\\" said Kenneth N. Allan, the project manager for Zerand, which is a division of Stevens Graphics Corporation of Fort Worth. He said the outstanding Soviet bill represented more than a yea's sales for Zerand, which makes machinery that folds cartons.    Zerand is not alone. The Commerce Department says about 20 other companies are owed money for goods delivered to the Soviet Union. Such overdue bills total more than $100 million, with many of the debts about a year old. Zerand is owed the most money by far and is by far the least experienced in trade with the Soviet Union.    A Commerce Department spokeswoman said a handful of companies have been paid in the last few months, but a similar number of companies have joined the list of those unpaid.     The companies affected are all small and medium-sized ones that specialize in providing hard-to-obtain equipment, like electronic and scientific gear, on short notice. Experts say the Soviets have been more careful about paying large companies for fear of jeopardizing long-term business relationships.    Not surprisingly, relations between the Soviet Union and the smaller companies have been strained. While the smaller companies do not carry the weight of an International Business Machines Corporation, they fill important niches in the $3 billion worth of exports sent to the Soviet Union from the United States.    Oleg Enoukov, the deputy representative in New York City for Vneshekonombank, the Soviet bank responsible for foreign exchange, said the payment delays were an accidental offshoot of his country's first steps toward economic restructuring.   \\"We are in the initial phase,\\" Mr. Enoukov said in a recent interview. \\"People are accustomed to receiving state support. They have to change their mentality.\\"   In a recent interview with Reuters in Moscow, a Deputy Foreign Minister, Ernest Obminsky, said the nation had no problem meeting its own debts, but acknowledged, \\"We do have a big backlog in paying back debts between companies.\\"   Soviet officials say it is difficult to estimate the total commercial debt arrears, but they say the bills are gradually being repaid and that the situation has not worsened since November.    Now, behind Zerand's lead, at least eight companies have agreed to pool their knowledge on trading with the Soviet Union in a determined effort to collect what they are owed.   It looks like they still have a way to go. They were hoping that Senator Bob Kasten, Republican of Wisconsin, would take up their cause and make payment of such debts a condition of extending new United States credit to the Soviet Union. Trade experts said companies in Germany, Italy and other European countries that were owed money on Soviet contracts were bailed out when their governments extended credit to the Soviet Union, with part of the money designated to pay the bills due the companies.  U.S. Action Called Unlikely     Unfortunately for the American companies, trade experts say there is little likelihood the United States will be extending new credit to the Soviet Union soon, because of concerns over Moscow's crackdown on the independence movements in the Baltics. An aide to Senator Kasten said there was little the Senator could do on the matter.    One measure of the frustration felt by executives of the American companies is their discarding of some of their shyness about publicizing their troubles. They had feared ruining their relationship with the Soviet Union, but now in interviews the executives describe a situation that leaves little room for maneuvering.   \\"This has caused us a great deal of difficulty,\\" Mr. Allan said. \\"We are entering a depression; capital goods are not doing so good.\\" He added, though, that the absence of the $32 million owed his company would not hamper operations.   Until recently in the Soviet Union, contracts involving a foreign company could take years to negotiate. The Soviet side would usually be represented by a foreign trade office, while the foreign company would be represented by an import-export company. But once a contract was signed, payment from a central bank in Moscow was sure and certain.    Now, trade experts say, the Soviet agencies have more freedom to make quick business agreements with foreigners, but those agencies have to find the hard currency to pay for the goods and services. A shortage of hard currency has in the last year caused repeated reports of delayed Soviet bill payments around the world.    \\"They did not plan ahead, and got into trouble,\\" said Daniel L. Bond, the vice president who conducts risk analysis at the Export-Import Bank.    The American companies say they had no warning of the change. \\"We are old-timers who dealt with the cream of the crop of companies,\\" said one East Coast importer, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. \\"Our clients were told they are on their own after the fact.\\"   This executive said his nine-year-old company was on the verge of declaring bankruptcy and badly needed the $70,000 it was owed from its Soviet deals.    Michael A. Herzen, president and founder of Techcare Systems Inc., a San Francisco-area company that sells medical and laboratory supplies, said a total of nearly $1 million had been overdue for nine months from various Soviet ministries.    He said the equipment his company delivered was already in use in the Soviet Union. \\"We haven't tried to get it back; we've tried to get the money back,\\" Mr. Herzen said.    Techcare's plight shows how few options are available to the companies that are owed money. Most say they are confident that they will be paid; they just do not know when. They can wait and hope the United States Government will intervene, or try to demand payment through an arbitration process.  Considering Arbitration     Mr. Herzen said he was contemplating appealing to the Soviet Chamber of Commerce, which was named the arbitrator in his company's contract. But he said such a move might end his Soviet business dealings.    \\"The purchasing agencies buy most of the stuff, and you can alienate them forever, and they will not do business with you,\\" Mr. Herzen said.    Having learned from past mistakes, Techcare and other companies, like Planet International Import-Export Ltd. of New York City, now make Soviet enterprises pay in advance or provide a letter of credit that assures the money is available once the goods are delivered.    But using such terms in contracts has reduced business by more than half, said Harold Weiner of Planet, who said his business was owed about $1 million.

This is from \\"Vintage Pellegrini: The Collected Wisdom of an American Buongustaio,\\" edited by Schuyler Ingle (Sasquatch Books).   The American, lacking the spur of necessity and engrossed in the exploitation of resources with which no other nation has been blessed in anything like the same degree, has been understandably satisfied to feed on plain meat and potatoes. His curiosity about culinary matters, of relatively recent origin, is an encouraging sign. If he would proceed wisely, however, he must remember that the evolution of a traditional cuisine requires time. His immediate concern should be a willingness to experiment, an insistence upon quality, a purging of his mind of all culinary prejudice, and the development of a humane attitude toward the dinner hour. These, and not a slavish imitation of foreign recipes and esoteric menus, are the bases upon which a sound American cuisine may be eventually developed. The Writer as Worker     Our image of writing as a magical act obscures the reality of the hard work that writers do and the true nature of a writer's life, according to the novelist Valerie Miner. This is from \\"Rumors From the Cauldron: Selected Essays, Reviews and Reportage\\" (University of Michigan, paper).   Tensions arise between audience and author when we confuse the writing with the writer herself. Most Americans romanticize art as magic. We perceive literature as the result of \\"creativity\\" rather than \\"creative labor,\\" forgetting that writers are workers. We invest the writer with special powers, in part because we want to experience the romance vicariously. . . . When we confuse the writing with the writer, we often expect her to be a stronger or more sensitive or more developed human being. . . . Acknowledging writing as work might have pervasive consequences. It might result in a less neurotic relationship between writers and readers. It might encourage better wages and working conditions for artists. It might inspire a clearer portrayal of working-class people in our books. It might open a light on how art can emerge from and contribute to an impulse for social change. Doing Without the Gods     Cultures define themselves in the stories of their beginnings, and for that purpose, the scholar Dudley Young suggests, mythology has often been a more efficient tool than science. This is from \\"Origins of the Sacred: The Ecstasies of Love and War\\" (St. Martin's).   Science, to put it bluntly, is uneasy with beginnings. Mythology, on the contrary, is concerned above all with what happened \\"in the beginning.\\" . . . Its signature is \\"Once upon a time,\\" and its characteristic way of bridging the gap between nonbeing and being is to imagine gods and goddesses to step over it. But it differs most importantly from science in that its explanatory account of how we began is also a prescriptive account of how subsequent beginnings (which renew the cosmos) should proceed","excerpt":"the Last Supper, for example, tells us not only how the Christian era began but how its energies can be periodically renewed in a communion meal that commemorates and recalls its inception. Modern poets such as Wallace Stevens have inherited from the myth makers of old the disposition to supply the perennial human need for once-upon-a-time stories that also inform our own beginnings, but they realize that such stories must on the whole do without the gods and goddesses of old, about whom we have become skeptical. Our Restless Species     Humans, the biologist John Janovy Jr. observes, are among the most footloose of species, relying in part on travel to help us define ourselves. This is from \\"Vermilion Sea: A Naturalist's Journey in Baja California\\" (Houghton Mifflin).   Pilgrimages seem to be almost instinctive, or at least derived from behaviors now so ingrained in our species that it's difficult to distinguish between genetic and social origins. Of all the animals that migrate, we are surely among the most restless. But humans retain the influence of the geophysical habitat in which they pass their formative years. And often, it seems, we are drawn back to our childhood homes -- if not physically, then mentally; if not out of love, then out of curiosity; if not by necessity, then by desire. Through such returnings we find out who we are. The Decline of Artful Swearing     We tend to believe that we live in the most enlightened of times, a view not borne out -- at least in the arena of frank language -- by a close study of history, as Geoffrey Hughes notes in \\"Swearing: A Social History of Foul Language, Oaths and Profanity in English\\" (Blackwell).   Although the view that there has been considerable liberation in modern times has much truth in it, the interpretation of a steady advance to enlightenment is simplistic. Such a view would hold that the constraints of medieval times were overthrown in the Renaissance, that there was a steady liberalization through the Enlightenment, a Puritanical regression in Victorian times, and a final throwing off of the shackles in the postwar era. Curiously, nearly all of these generalizations are inaccurate. Chaucer and many medieval writers had more freedom than their Renaissance successors; the Enlightenment saw a steady clamping down on strong or risque language, while the Victorian era showed a remarkable efflorescence of strong and foul language, in some ways surpassing that of modern times. However, it took place out of earshot of \\"polite society.\\" Noted With Pleasure"},{"year":"2001","title":"During last year's campaign, George W.

So it is a pleasant surprise to drive into downtown Peoria and come upon just such a scene: three luxury office buildings in various stages of completion, with sidewalks blocked off to make room for steel beams and slabs of marble facing.    Peoria is not an anomaly. Office towers are also going up along the downtown streets of Cleveland, Columbus and Milwaukee, among other Midwestern cities. But if Peoria's builders are any guide, then the construction so visible in these heartland cities is hardly a leading indicator of a construction revival elsewhere in the land. Rather it signals that the nation's free-wheeling office-building of the 1980's is in its last throes.

Big Time Sarah does everything a good-time blues belter has to do: she shouts, she rasps, she wails, she slings double-entendres and she gets the audience to join in. Her group, the B.T.S.

Take the raucous twang of rocked-up rockabilly and splash on the tone clusters and manic piano pounding that link Jerry Lee Lewis to Sun Ra. Add to a seemingly bottomless repertory of well-known and obscure old songs, throw in some jovial pop originals by the band, and this results in N.R.B.Q., a band as unpredictable as it is seasoned.

Among the coterie of young bands rooted in the Grateful Dead's jamming, God Street has a few custom options: glimmers of progressive rock and reggae, an occasional rap and a post-hippie precision. Otherwise, the two-chord vamps just keep percolating along for the tie-dyed dancers. Tickets are $28.50 in advance, $33 on Saturday. J. P. Blues and Techno    Crystal Waters and Lords of Acid, Limelight, 660 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, (212) 807-7850). With her tart, unsentimental voice, Crystal Waters carries the corrosive rhythm-and-blues of Dinah Washington and Esther Phillips into the era of house music. Her lyrics aren't always simple exhortations to dance; her 1991 hit, \\"Gypsy Woman,\\" combined an irresistible \\"la-da-dee, la-da-dah\\" chorus with verses about a homeless woman. Lords of Acid, from Belgium, combine fast, propulsive techno music with lyrics about as many taboos as they can formulate. \\"I want to talk to you about the forbidden pleasures of the flesh,\\" a woman announces to open a single called \\"The Crablouse.\\" Doors open at 9 P.M.; Ms. Waters is to performs about 11:30 P.M., the Lords of Acid at 1:30 A.M.

Two generations of women's punk-rock. Debbie Harry, who led Blondie in the 1970's and early 80's, helped invent a cool, clear-headed, barbed pop that opened doors for performers as diverse as Madonna, the Go-Go's and Liz Phair. The Lunachicks are faster, sloppier and louder, sometimes angrier, sometimes funnier. Admission is $25. Doors open at 9 P.M.; the Lunachicks are to perform at 11:30 P.M. and Debbie Harry at 2 A.M. J. P. Funk and Social Issues    Milo Z., A.K.A., 77 West Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 673-7325. Milo Z. revives the plunging bass lines and wah-wah guitars of 1970's funk. While the music echoes Kool and the Gang and Parliament-Funkadelic, the lyrics take on social issues from interracial romance to gun control. Three sets to begin at 10 P.M.; $75 admission includes an open bar. J. P.

Masque is a new group led by Vernon Reid, the guitarist in Living Colour, who can blast out hard-rock riffs, zoom through blistering solos or jab and squiggle into realms of electric jazz. The Sun Ra Arkestra has lost its keyboardist and navigator, Sun Ra, but its longtime saxophonist, John Gilmore, leads one of the few big bands to embrace both Fletcher Henderson's swing arrangements and the open-ended possibilities of \\"Space Is the Place.\\" Doors open at 8 P.M.; music is to begin at 9 P.M.

The longer the grapes linger on the vine, soaking up sun and producing sugar, the richer and sweeter they become. If grapes are picked at the critical moment - when their sugar concentration is high but they retain sufficient acid to make a lively wine - the result can be extraordinarily appealing. The most notable examples include the great Sauternes of France and the Beerenausleses and Trockenbeerenausleses of Germany. Because of the risks involved in producing superior sweet wines - a sudden frost can kill a year's crop - they are not made every year. Hence, they are scarce and priced accordingly. But to those who appreciate their sun-drenched nectar, they are worth seeking out.   Fortunately, Chateau d'Yquem and Trockenbeerenausleses are not the only sweet wines of the world. Several regions in France, as well as most grape-growing countries of the world, turn out less publicized yet eminently enjoyable sweet wines. Two of the more intriguing examples are the so-called vin jaune, or yellow wine, of the Cotes du Jura east of Burgundy and the Malvasia delle Lipari, a deep golden, apricot-scented wine produced on a cluster of tiny islands off the northern coast of Sicily.

A selection of his short films, made between 1968 and 1971, opened last night at the Film Forum in a program that should interest anyone who cares for what movies look like and who wonders where they may be going. Rimmer has adapted several of the styles popular during the last few years, and he has done so with charm as well as skill.The earliest and the latest of these films are the least impressive — the earliest (\\"Square Inch Field\\" and \\"Migration\\") mainly repeating the expanded-mind imagery adventures that by now seem generic to the independent cinema","excerpt":"the latest (\\"West Coast Workprint\\"), a diary film about communal living in the Pacific Northwest, being a work in progress on which more progress has to be made.It is what I guess should be called middle-period Rimmer (1970 through early 1971) that I like the best. \\"Surfacing on the Thames,\\" loop films such as \\"The Dance\\" and \\"Seashore\\" and the storefront study \\"Real Italian Pizza\\"—all play wittily and rather elegantly with the idea of film itself, and all investigate the moving image with a kind of concentration most appropriate to a short film.Both \\"Seashore\\" and \\"The Dance\\" are loops made of old-movie footage, and they become ghostly evocations of lost energy, broken records of a life long past, as a pair of whirling ballroom dancers repeat the same steps beyond the limits of endurance, or as happy bathers timidly disappear again and again into the same line of surf.\\"Surfacing on the Thames,\\" on the other hand, sees the great river as almost motionless, caught in a misty, monochromatic print like a Whistler painting—while on the surface of the film, little changes take place. Wrinkles appear, or a small smudge in one corner—and you find yourself moving between the sublime and the ridiculous without budging an inch.In \\"Real Italian Pizza\\" Rimmer covers six months of sidewalk life in front of a New York City pizza parlor in 11 minutes, not by speeding things up but by slowing them down in a kind of stop-action selectivity. School-children pass by, a football team passes by, panhandlers beg, some youngsters are picked up by the police, it snows, snow melts—and a cheerful, slightly crazy jauntiness prevails that may be as close as film form can come to really capturing a mood of the city.

And sometimes, as in  the case of the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991, the draft is very rough indeed. Not surprisingly, the war's fifth anniversary last month prompted a series of revisionist retrospectives.         To a degree unprecedented in recent American history, reporters were limited  in what they were permitted to see in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. A good deal of what they did see never reached print or got onto the air, at least in the brief period when the world was paying close attention. Some of what they were told by United States officials was untrue, either because the officials did not know the truth or because they did not wish it to be known.

He seizes upon the absence of Secretary Long to give orders, anticipating war with Spain over the sinking of the Maine.The recruiting of the Rough Riders is pictured most effectively, for the scenes show the cowboys, the sons of poor and rich, and even a Sheriff and a loose character among the gathering. It is in these glimpses that the picture excels, for Victor Fleming, the director, has introduced a nice sprinkling of humor, which is aided in no small way by Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld's telling orchestration.During the intermission the delighted men and women were heard discussing the points of the picture that pleased them most. Some loved the actions of an old band leader, while others relished the ancient popular songs, such as \\"A Bicycle Built for Two,\\" \\"Annie Rooney,\\" \\"Good-bye, Molly Darling,\\" \\"A Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight,\\" \\"After the Ball,\\" and other airs. And instead of the modern jazz tunes one heard these spectators humming these melodies of bygone days.Although Noah Beery, as Sheriff Hells Bells of Byloe County, Texas, and George Bancroft as Happy Joe, furnished most of the comedy, it was Charles Farrell, as Stewart Van Brunt, the hero, who captured the hearts of the audience. His escapades were filmed with the idea of showing that Van Brunt, a wealthy young man, has a sense of humor as well as being good-looking. Mr. Farrell, who officiated as the gallant young sailor in \\"Old Ironsides,\\" has a far better opportunty in this new offering, and he takes advantage of every incident to express his emotions with a sense of humor.While the Rough Riders are still in Texas, there is an episode that aroused loud laughter. It is where the old, plump band leader is glancing at his music sheets, noticing where 'shot and echo\\" comes. He is unaware that Hells Bells and Happy Joe are having another of their periodical spats, in the course of which they discharge their ponderous pistols, which action is contagious, for other men of the Rough Riders pull their triggers and the band master is driven almost hysterical.Hells Bells just misses apprehending Happy Joe for horse-stealing, because Joe had offered his services to Uncle Sam. Throughout various sequences Hells Bells constantly shakes a pair of handcuffs in Jae's face, to remind him that when the war is over and he is discharged, Joe is going back to Byloe County as his, the Sheriff's prisoner. Hells Bells is afraid that even the sea may cheat him of his victim.Van Brunt and a Sergeant of the regulars indulge in a fight, which is splendidly filmed and amazingly well acted by Mr. Farrell, who always appears to be ready with a half wink, whether he intends to kiss Mary (Mary Astor) or get a blow in on the Sergeant's jaw. Colonel Roosevelt is supposed to be infuriated at the young fighter, of whom he decides to make an example. Mary, however, intercedes for Van Brunt, and therefore he suffers only demotion to a private.While the scenes in which Van Brunt carries the wounded Bert Henley are too long, both Mr. Farrell and Charles Emmett Mack awaken considerable interest in this stretch by the sincerity of their acting.In Cuba the Spanish soldiers are dressed in white and they are seen in slipshod trenches. The sharpshooters are hidden in trees and the old Gatling gun was the machine gun of the era.In one series of scenes the \\"embalmed beef\\" comes in for attention, and even out of this Mr. Fleming has extracted some comedy. The soldiers tell the bugler that the next time he sounds the mess call and there is nothing but the bad meat to eat, they will blow \\"taps\\" over him. Nevertheless the bugler is called upon to sound the call and he does so timidly, fleeing before he has finished.Not the least effective portion of this picture is that devoted to the disembarkation of horses, the animals being pushed down the vessel's runway into the sea.In the closing scenes the inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt is depicted both by actual scenes and then by close-ups that are spliced in between the news reel \\"shots.\\"\\"The Rough Riders\\" is a bully entertainment.

Out of Russia has come a sensitive and charming little picture about the simple psychology of a child that sheds more light upon the nature of the Russian people than all the fierce sky-filling blasts of nuclear bombs.It is called here \\"A Summer to Remember.\\" It opened at the Murray Hill yesterday, and it merits the attention of everybody who is having (or has had) the bewildering experience of raising a child. The former should find it a profoundly consoling and instructive exercise","excerpt":"the latter should get from it the great joy of reviewing sweet familiarities.For into this lovely little drama, its writers and directors have put an extraordinary loth of understanding of the relations of parent and child, a great deal of droll appreciation of the normal bewilderment of the tot and especially a wealth of recognition of how to break—and not to break—a youngster's heart.Indeed, it might be suspected that this item from the Mosfilm Studios, which is being distributed in this country in the Soviet-American cultural exchange, was particularly made and intended for use by child study groups, so extensive and penetrating is its psychological range and trenchancy.Written by Georgy Danelia and Igor Talankin in collaboration with Vera Panova, a popular Soviet author upon whose novel, \\"Seryozha,\\" the script is based, and directed by those two young artists in a delightfully fresh and casual style, it sugars wisdom with humor, instruction with honest sentiment.It begins with its sturdy little hero, a towheaded 5-year-old, played with rare naturalness and valor by one Borya Barkhatov, taking with suspicion and resentment the awareness that his widowed mother is about to marry again, then facing his new stepfather with dread and jealousy.The two are soon friends, however, when the stepfather buys the boy a bike and doesn't knock him around for permitting some little pals to break it up in one day. Indeed, the lad swings to his new parent with a natural idolatry when he discovers the latter in a news film as the honored director of a collective farm.Various small-boy experiences follow, all developed with humor and charm, all describing the various reactions and moods of a healthy, sensitive child. There's a lovely experience with the uncle of one of the lad's older friends, the uncle being a visiting sea captain all covered with sensational tattos. (For a short while the lad is determined to be a sea captain when he grows up.)There's the inevitable sibling conflict when a new baby arrives and theh mother (always tougher on the youngster than the kind stepfather) pushes him aside. The boy becomes ill, which would follow (though the point is not stressed by the film), and this illness leads into the major crisis, which is a question of the parents leaving the boy behind to spend a winter with his grandparents when they have to move hurriedly to a new job.The classic depth of a child's anxiety—being abandoned — is thus adroitly plumbed. The delicate and touching pull out of it is the crowning reward of the film.This may sound pat and sentimental, and it might be if it weren't so nicely done, so pleasantly brightened with humor, so sparked with a witty musical score and so warmly played by everybody, notably by Sergei Bondarchuk and Irana Skobtseva in the parent roles. Even though spoken in Russian, the actors' voices are full of strength and love, and English subtitles give a notion of the affection in the things they say.Of course, international competition is cold and disheartening these days, but a warm ray of hope and reassurance about the humanity and compassion of the Russian people happily shines from this film.

Although this review pretends grandly to show \\"the great strength of the German Army during the early part of the war,\\" \\"the story of the birth of the Red Army\\" and a few other sensational things, it is mainly a compendium of mediocre and repetitious news-fact shots, supplemented by a sonorous narration in which Quentin Reynolds talks a much better picture than is shown.\\"One Inch From Victory\\" is prefaced by a twenty-minute memoir, made up of old films surveying the development of Russia up to 1941. It then intercuts German war films with some of our own familiar newsreels to suggest the advance of the Nazis across Russia while the world held its breath. Mostly the captured enemy pictures are simply shots of soldiers running across fields, German tanks going into action and scenes in Russian cities after the Nazis marched in. Best of the lot are glimpses of Nazi soldiers in the high Caucasus. The film is concluded with newsreels taken at the Teheran conference.Needless to say, such a survey is inadequate to summarize or even to give a faint conception of the monstrousness of the Russian war.

Thompson, the main attraction in \\"Where the Buffalo Roam,\\" isn't a clear enough character to hang a whole movie on, but he's certainly the life of any party. During the course of the film, Mr. Thompson is seen brightening up a wide variety of occasions as he practices Gonzo journalism, which is something he invented along with that doctoral degree. It certainly takes practice.He takes drugs, then flies an airplane while singing \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.\\" He takes more drugs, then shoots his own telecopier machine and takes aim at the telephone whenever it rings. He coaxes a room-service waiter and a maid to set up a very small football game in his hotel room on the day of the Super Bowl, and scores enough touchdowns to splinter all the mirrors. He trades his ticket for the game for a bottle of wine he sees a man drinking on the street. The bottle is in a brown paper bag, but that's fine. Whatever else Mr. Thompson may be, he isn't fussy.\\"Where the Buffalo Roam,\\" which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and stars Bill Murray, includes a number of funny gambits and very little glue. Mr. Murray is clever whenever he is audible — which isn't all the time, because he speaks with a cigarette holder clenched between his teeth, and the film's director, Art Linson, has a way of training the camera away from the speaker, making it difficult to lip-read. But the story rambles desperately, and there are times when the screenplay is barely there. Mr. Thompson's only identifiable quality soon becomes facetiousness, and it wears terribly thin.As a writer for Rolling Stone, which for some reason is called Blast magazine here, Mr. Thompson is seen covering 1968 marijuana trials in San Francisco, the 1972 Super Bowl and the 1972 Presidential campaign, during which he either sees or imagines seeing Richard M. Nixon in a men's room. He is joined in these adventures by a wild-eyed lawyer, played by Peter Boyle","excerpt":"the lawyer, like Mr. Thompson himself, is a figure much more amusingly drawn in Mr. Thompson's writings than he is here. Their carousing goes from funny to flat and back again, lurching unpredictably between extremes. Both Mr. Boyle and Mr. Murray are occasional victims of Mr. Linson's awkward timing, when the film either cuts short laughs or lingers too long on dull material.The score for \\"Where the Buffalo Roam,\\" by Neil Young, works very well with the film. It includes Motown material, some rock anthems of the late 1960's by Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix. It also offers Mr. Young's own approach to \\"Home on the Range,\\" which is performed here in several haunting versions.The 1979-80 Trustees Award of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has been awarded to Leonard H.

Shades of Henry Willson, the notorious Hollywood manager who groomed many homosexual himbos for stardom -- sometimes literally. (In ''The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson,'' a recent biography of Willson, Robert Hofler writes that Willson arranged a marriage between his secretary and Hudson.) Amazingly, it's much the same game 50 years later, in the real world and in Beane's, where the idea of a male star walking down the red carpet with his boyfriend is as ludicrous as the unnatural liaisons in the nursery rhyme that provides the play's title.

Mr. Shamir's speech was recorded by Reuters. The Associated Press recorded the speech by Mr. Abdel-Shafi, who spoke mainly in English. Mr. Sharaa's remarks were translated from the Arabic by the conference's organizers and provided by The A.P.  YITZHAK SHAMIR     It is an honor to represent the people of Israel at this historic moment and a privilege to address this opening of peace talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.    I would like to express our profound appreciation to our Spanish hosts for their hospitality, and for making this gathering for peace possible. In its 2,000 years of wandering, the Jewish people paused here for several hundred years until they were expelled 500 years ago. It was in Spain that the great Jewish poet and philosopher, Yehuda Halevi, expressed the yearning for Zion of all Jews, in the words, \\"My heart is in the East, while I am in the uttermost West.\\"    I would also like to extend our appreciation to the co-sponsors of this conference -- to the U.S., which has maintained a strong friendship with Israel in an alliance that has overcome occasional differences. And to the Soviet Union, which saved the lives of many Jews during the Second World War and has now opened its gates to the repatriation of Jews to their ancient homeland.    The people of Israel look to this palace with great anticipation and expectation. We pray that this meeting will mark the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the Middle East, that it will signal the end of hostility, violence, terror and war. That it will bring dialogue, accommodation, coexistence and, above all, peace.    Ladies and Gentlemen.    To appreciate the meaning of peace for the people of Israel, one has to view today's Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel against the background of our history. Jews have been persecuted throughout the ages in almost every continent. Some countries barely tolerated us, others oppressed, tortured, slaughtered and exiled us. This century saw the Nazi regime set out to exterminate us. The Shoah, the Holocaust, the catastrophic genocide of unprecedented proportions which destroyed a third of our people, became possible because no one defended us. Being homeless, we were also defenseless.    But it was not the Holocaust which made the world community recognize our rightful claim to the Land of Israel. In fact, the rebirth of the state of Israel so soon after the Holocaust has made the world forget that our claim is immemorial. We are the only people who have lived in the Land of Israel without interruption for nearly 4,000 years. We are the only people, except for a short crusader kingdom, who have had an independent sovereignty in this land. We are the only people for whom Jerusalem has been a capital. We are the only people whose sacred places are only in the land of Israel.                    . . .         No nation has expressed its bond with its land with as much intensity and consistency as we have. For millennia our people repeated at every occasion the cry of the psalmist,: \\"If I forget thee, Jerusalem, may my right hand lose its cunning!.\\" For millennia we have encouraged each other with the greeting, \\"Nnext year in Jerusalem.!\\" For millennia our prayers, literature and folklore have expressed powerful longing to return to our land. Only Eretz Israel, the Land of Israel, is our true homeland. Any other country, no matter how hospitable, is still a diaspora, a temporary station on the way home.   To others, it was not an attractive land. No one wanted it. Mark Twain described it only a hundred years ago as \\"a desolate country, which sits in sackcloth and ashes, a silent mournful expanse, which not even imagination can grace with the pomp of life.\\"    The Zionist movement gave political expression to our claim to the Land of Israel. And in 1922 the League of Nations recognized the justice of this claim. It understood the compelling historic imperative of establishing a Jewish homeland in the Land of Israel. The United Nations Organization reaffirmed this recognition after the Second World War.    Regrettably the Arab leaders, whose friendship we wanted most, opposed a Jewish state in the region. With a few distinguished exceptions, they claimed that the Land of Israel is part of the Arab domain that stretches from the Atlantic to the Persian Gulf.   In defiance of international will and legality, the Arab regimes attempted to overrun and destroy the Jewish state even before it was born. The Arab spokesman at the U.N. declared that the establishment of a Jewish state would cause a bloodbath which would make the slaughters of Ghengis Khan pale into insignificance.    In its declaration of independence on May 15, 1948, Israel stretched out its hand in peace to its Arab neighbors, calling for an end to war and bloodshed. In response, seven Arab states invaded Israel. The U.N. resolution that partitioned the country was thus violated and effectively annulled.    The U.N. did not create Israel. The Jewish state came into being because the tiny Jewish community, in what was Mandatory Palestine, rebelled against foreign imperialist rule. We did not conquer a foreign land. We repulsed the Arab onslaught, prevented Israel's annihilation, declared its independence and established a viable state and government institutions within a very short time.  After their attack on Israel failed, the Arab regimes continued their fight against Israel with boycott, blockade, terrorism and outright war. Soon after the establishment of Israel, they turned against the Jewish communities in Arab countries. A wave of oppression, expropriation and expulsion caused a mass exodus of some 800,000 Jews from lands they had inhabited from before the rise of Islam. Distortion of History     Most of these Jewish refugees, stripped of their considerable possessions, came to Israel. They were welcomed by the Jewish state. They were given shelter and support, and they were integrated into Israeli society together with half a million survivors of the European Holocaust.    The Arab regimes' rejection of Israel's existence in the Middle East and the continuous war they have waged against it are part of history. There have been attempts to rewrite this history, which depict the Arabs as victims and Israel as the aggressor. Like attempts to deny the Holocaust, they will fail. With the demise of totalitarian regimes in most of the world, this perversion of history will disappear.    In their war against Israel's existence, the Arab governments took advantage of the cold war. They enlisted the military, economic and political support of the Communist world against Israel, and they turned a local, regional conflict into an international powder keg. This caused the Middle East to be flooded with arms, which fuelled wars and turned the area into a dangerous battleground and a testing arena for sophisticated weapons. At the U.N., the Arab states mustered the support of other Muslim countries and the Soviet bloc. Together they had an automatic majority for countless resolutions that perverted history, paraded fiction as fact and made a travesty of the U.N. and its charter.    Arab hostility to Israel has also brought tragic human suffering to the Arab people. Tens of thousands have been killed and wounded. Hundreds of thousands of Arabs who lived in Mandatory Palestine were encouraged by their own leaders to flee from their homes. Their suffering is a blot on humanity. No decent person, least of all a Jew of this era, can be oblivious to this suffering.    Several hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs live in slums known as refugee camps in Gaza, Judea and Samaria. Attempts by Israel to rehabilitate and house them have been defeated by Arab objections. Nor has their fate been any better in Arab states. Unlike the Jewish refugees who came to Israel from Arab countries, most Arab refugees were neither welcomed nor integrated by their hosts. Only the kingdom of Jordan awarded them citizenship. Their plight has been used as a political weapon against Israel.    The Arabs who have chosen to remain in Israel -- Christian and Muslim -- have become full-fledged citizens enjoying equal rights and representation in the legislature, in the judiciary and in all walks of life.    We, who over the centuries were denied access to our holy places, respect the religion of all faiths in our country. Our law guarantees freedom of worship and protects the holy places of every religion. . . .    I stand before you today in yet another quest for peace, not only on behalf of the State of Israel, but in the name of the entire Jewish people, that has maintained an unbreakable bond with the Land of Israel for almost 4,000 years.                    . . .         We have always believed that only direct, bilateral talks can bring peace. We have agreed to precede such talks with this ceremonial conference, but we hope that Arab consent to direct, bilateral talks indicates an understanding that there is no other way to peace. In the Middle East, this has special meaning, because such talks imply mutual acceptance, and the root cause of the conflict is the Arab refusal to recognize the legitimacy of the State of Israel.    The multilateral talks that would accompany the bilateral negotiations are a vital component in the process. In these talks, the essential ingredients of coexistence and regional cooperation will be discussed. There cannot be genuine peace in our region unless these regional issues are addressed and resolved.    We believe the goal of the bilateral negotiations is to sign peace treaties between Israel and its neighbors, and to reach an agreement on interim self-government arrangements with the Palestinian Arabs.    But nothing can be achieved without good will. I appeal to the Arab leaders, those who are here and those who have not yet joined the process: Show us and the world that you accept Israel's existence. Demonstrate your readiness to accept Israel as a permanent entity in the region. Let the people in our region hear you speak in the language of reconciliation, coexistence and peace with Israel. Renouncing the Uprising     In Israel there is an almost total consensus for the need for peace. We only differ on the best ways to achieve it. In most Arab countries the opposite seems to be true: the only differences are over the ways to push Israel into a defenseless position and, ultimately, to destruction. We would like to see in your countries an end to poisonous preachings against Israel. We would like to see an indication of the kind of hunger for peace which characterizes Israeli society.    We appeal to you to renounce the Jihad against Israel. We appeal to you to denounce the P.L.O. covenant which calls for Israel's destruction. We appeal to you to condemn declarations that call for Israel's annihilation, like the one issued by the rejectionist conference in Teheran last week. We appeal to you to let Jews, who wish to leave your countries, go.    And we address a call to the Palestinian Arabs: renounce violence and terrorism, use the universities in the administered territories -- whose existence was made possible only by Israel -- for learning and development, not agitation and violence, stop exposing your children to danger by sending them to throw bombs and stones at soldiers and civilians.    Just two days ago, we were reminded that Palestinian terrorism is still rampant when a mother of seven children and a father of four were slaughtered in cold blood. We cannot remain indifferent and be expected to talk with people involved in such repulsive activities.    We appeal to you to shun dictators like Saddam Hussein who aim to destroy Israel, stop the brutal torture and murder of those who do not agree with you, allow us, and the world community, to build decent housing for the people who now live in refugee camps. Above all, we hope you finally realize that you could have been at this table long ago, soon after the Camp David accords were first concluded, had you chosen dialogue instead of violence, coexistence instead of terrorism.                    . . .         We know our partners to the negotiations will make territorial demands on Israel. But, as an examination of the conflict's long history makes clear, its nature is not territorial. It raged well before Israel acquired Judea, Samaria, Gaza and the Golan in a defensive war. There was no hint of recognition of Israel before the war in 1967, when the territories in question were not under Israeli control.    We are a nation of four million. The Arab nations from the Atlantic to the gulf number 170 million. We control only 28,000 square kilometers. The Arabs possess a land mass of 14 million square kilometers. The issue is not territory but our existence.    It will be regrettable if the talks focus primarily and exclusively on territory. It is the quickest way to an impasse. What we need, first and foremost, is the building of confidence, the removal of the danger of confrontation and the development of relations in as many spheres as possible.  Site of Talks     The issues are complex, and the negotiations will be lengthy and difficult. We submit that the best venue for the talks is in our region, in close proximity to the decision makers, not in a foreign land. We invite our partners to this process to come to Israel for the first round of talks. On our part, we are ready to go to Jordan, to Lebanon and to Syria for the same purpose. There is no better way to make peace than to talk in each other's home. . . .   For many hundreds of years, wars, deep antagonisms and terrible suffering cursed this continent on which we meet. The nations of Europe saw the rise of dictators and their defeat after lengthy and painful struggles. Now, they are together -- former bitter enemies -- in a united community. They are discussing the good of the community, cooperating in all matters, acting almost as one unit. I envy them. I would like to see such a community rise in the Middle East. And I believe that, despite all differences between us, we should be able, gradually, to build a united regional community.   Today it is a dream, but we have seen, in our own lifetime, some of the most fantastic dreams become reality. Today, the gulf separating the two sides is still too wide, the Arab hostility to Israel too deep, the lack of trust too immense, to permit a dramatic, quick solution. But, we must start on the long road to reconciliation with this first step in the peace process.  HAIDAR ABDEL-SHAFI     Once again, Christian, Muslim and Jew face the challenge of heralding a new era enshrined in global values of democracy, human rights, justice and security. From Madrid, we launch this quest for peace, a quest to place the sanctity of human life at the center of our world and to redirect our energies and resources from the pursuit of mutual destruction to the pursuit of long prosperity, progress and happiness.   We, the people of Palestine, stand before you in the fullness of our pain, our pride, and our anticipation for we have long harbored a yearning for peace and a dream of justice and freedom. For too long, the Palestinian people have gone unheeded, silenced and denied, our identity negated by political expediency, our rightful struggle against injustice maligned, and our present existence subsumed by the past tragedy of another people.   For the greater part of this century, we have been victimized by the myth of a land without the people and described with impunity as the invisible Palestinians. Before such willful blindness, we refused to disappear or to accept a distorted identity. Our intifada is a testimony to our perseverence and the resilience waged in a just struggle to regain our rights.   It is time for us to narrate our own story, to stand witness as advocates of a truth which has long lain buried in the consciousness and conscience of the world. We do not stand before you as supplicants, but, rather, as the torchbearers who knew that in our world of today ignorance can never be an excuse. We seek neither an admission of guilt after the fact nor vengeance for past inequities, but, rather, an act of will that would make a just peace a reality. . . .   The co-sponsors have invited us here today to present our case and to reach out to the others with whom we have had to face a mutually exclusive reality on the land of Palestine. But even in the invitation to this peace conference, our narrative was distorted and our truth only partially acknowledged.   Palestinian people are one fused by centuries of history in Palestine, bound together by a collective memory of shared sorrows and joys and sharing a unity of purpose and vision. Our songs and ballads, our . . . children's stories, the dialect of our joys, of our jokes, the image of our poems, . . . which colors even our happiest moments, are as important to us as the blood ties which link our families and clans.   Yet, an invitation to discuss peace, the peace we all desire and need, comes to only a portion of our people. It ignores our national, historical and organic unity. We come here wrenched from our sisters and brothers in anxiety to stand before you as the Palestinians under occupation, although we maintain that each of us represents the rights and interests of the whole.   We have been denied the right to publicly acknowledge our loyalty to our leadership and system of government, but allegiance and loyalty cannot be censored or severed.   Our acknowledged leadership is more than just the democratically chosen leadership of all the Palestinian people. It is the symbol of our national unity and identity, the guardian of our past, the protector of our present and the hope of our future. Brutality of Occupation     Our people have chosen to entrust it with their history and the preservation of our precious legacy. This leadership has been clearly and unequivocally recognized by the community of nations with only a few exceptions, who had chosen for so many years shadow over substance.   The governance of the nation and conditions of our oppression, whether the disposition and dispersion of exile or the brutality and repression of the occupation -- the Palestinian people cannot be torn asunder. They remain united, a nation, wherever they are or are forced to be. In Jerusalem, ladies and gentlemen, the city which is not only the soul of Palestine but the cradle of free-world religions is tangible, even in its claimed absence from our midst at this stage. Its apparent, though artificial, exclusion from this conference is a denial of its right to seek peace and redemption for it, too, has suffered through more an occupation.   Jerusalem, the city of peace, has been barred from the peace conference and deprived of its calling. Palestinian Jerusalem, the capital of our homeland and future state, defines Palestinian existence past, present and future, but itself has been denied a voice and an identity. Jerusalem defies exclusive possessiveness or bondage. Israel's annexation of Arab Jerusalem remains most clearly illegal in the eyes of the world community and an affront to the peace that this city deserves.   We come to you from a tortured land and a proud, though captive, people, having been asked to negotiate with our occupiers, but leaving behind the children of the intifada and the people under occupation and under curfew, who enjoyed us not to surrender or forget. As we speak, thousands of our brothers and sisters are languishing in Israeli prisons and detention camps, most detained without evidence, charge or trial, many cruelly mistreated and tortured in interrogation, guilty only of seeking freedom or daring to defy the occupation. We speak in their name, and we say, \\"Set them free.\\"   . . . As we speak, the eyes of thousands of Palestinian refugees, deportees, and displaced persons since 1967 are haunting us for exile as a cruel fate. Bring them home. They have the right to return. As we speak, the silence of demolished homes echoes through the halls and in our minds.   We must rebuild our homes and our free state. And what do we tell the loved ones of those killed by army bullets? How do we answer the questions and the fear in our children's eyes for one out of three Palestinian children under occupation has been killed, injured or detained in the past four years?   How can we explain to our children that they are denied education or schools so often closed by the army . . . or why their life is in danger for raising a flag in the land where even children are killed or jailed? What requiem can be sung for trees uprooted by army bulldozers? And, most of all, who can explain to those whose lands are confiscated and free waters stolen?   . . . Remove the barbed wire, restore the land and its life-giving water. The settlements must stop now. Peace cannot be waged while Palestinian land is confiscated in myriad ways and the status of the occupied territories is being decided each day by Israeli bulldozers and barbed wire.   This is not simply a position. It is an irrefutable reality. Territory for peace is a travesty when territory for illegal settlement is official Israeli policy and practice. Settlements must stop now. Equal Partnership     In the name of the Palestinian people, we wish to directly address the Israeli people, with whom we have had a prolonged exchange of pain. Let us share hope, instead. We are willing to live side by side on the land and the promise of the future.   Sharing, however, requires two partners willing to share as equals. Mutuality and reciprocity requires -- must replace domination and hostility for genuine reconciliation and coexistence under international legality. Your security and ours are mutually dependent, as entwined as the fears and nightmares of our children.   We have seen some of you at your best and at your worst, for the occupier can hide no secrets from the occupied, and we are witness to the toll that occupation has exacted from you and yours. We have seen you anguish over the transformation of your sons and daughters into instruments of a blind and violent occupation, and we are sure that at no time did you envisage such a role for the children whom you thought would forge your future. We have seen you look back in deepest sorrow at the tragedy of your past and look on in horror at the disfigurement of the victim turned oppressor. Not for this have you nurtured your hopes, dreams and your offspring.                    . . .         To the co-sponsors and participants in this occasion of awe and challenge, we pledge our commitment to the principle of justice, peace, and reconciliation, based on international legitimacy and uniform standards. . . .  We shall pursue our people's right to self-determination, to the exhilaration of freedom and to the warmth of the sun as a nation among equals.   This is the moment of truth. You must have the courage to recognize it and the will to implement it, for our truth can no longer be hidden away in the dark recesses of inadvertency or neglect. People of Palestine look at you with straightforward, word-for-word, direct gaze, seeking to touch your heart, for you have dared to stir up hopes that cannot be abandoned.   You cannot afford to let us down, for we have lived up to the values you espoused and we have remained true to our cause. We, the Palestinian people, made the imaginative leap in the Palestine National Council of November 1988, during which the Palestine Liberation Organization launched its peace initiative based on Security Council Resolution 242 and 338 and declared Palestinian independence based on Resolution 181 of the United Nations, which gave birth to two states in 1948, Israel and Palestine. Mutual Recognition     In December 1988, a historic speech before the United Nations in Geneva led directly to the launching of the Palestinian-American dialogue. Ever since then, our people have responded positively to every serious peace initiative and has done its utmost to insure the success of this process.   Instead, on the other hand -- Israel, on the other hand, has placed many obstacles and barriers in the path of peace to negate the very -- the validity of the process. Its illegal and frenzied settlement activity is the most glaring evidence of its rejectionism, the latest settlement being erected just two days ago.   These historic decisions of the Palestine National Council wrenched the course of history from inevitable confrontation and conflict toward peace and mutual recognition. With our own hands and in an act of sheer will, we have molded the shape of the future of our people. Our parliament has articulated the message of the people, with the courage to say yes to the challenge of history, just as it provided a reference in its resolutions last month in Algiers and in the Central Council meeting this month in Tunis to go forward to this historic conference. We cannot be made to bear the brunt of other people's no. We must have reciprocity. We must have peace.                    . . .         Our homeland has never ceased to exist in our minds and hearts, but it has to exist as a state on all the territories occupied by Israel in the war of 1967, with Arab Jerusalem as its capital in the context of that city's special status and its nonexclusive character.   This state, in a conditional emergence, has already been a subject of anticipation for too long. It should take place today, rather than tomorrow. However, we are willing to accept the proposal for a transitional state, provided interim arrangements are not transformed into permanent status. The time frame must be condensed to respond to the dispossessed Palestinians' urgent need for sanctuary and to the occupied Palestinians' right to gain relief from oppression and to win recognition of their authentic will.   During this phase, international protection for our people is most urgently needed, and the -- the dual application of the Fourth Geneva Convention is a necessary condition. . . . Bilateral negotiations on the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the dissolution of Israeli administration, and the transfer of authority to the Palestinian people cannot proceed under coercion or threat in the current asymmetry of power. Israel must demonstrate its willingness to negotiate in good faith by immediately halting all settlement activity and land confiscation while implementing meaningful confidence-building measures.                    . . .         We are here today with the support of our people, who have given itself the right to hope and to make a stand for peace. We must recognize as well that some of our people harbor serious doubts and skepticism about this process.   Within our democratic social and political structures, we have evolved a respect for pluralism and diversity and we shall guard the opposition's right to differ within the parameters of mutual respect and national unity. . . . The process launched here must lead us to the light at the end of the tunnel. And this light is the promise of a new Palestine -- free, democratic, and respectful of human rights and the integrity of nature.   Self-determination, ladies and gentlemen, can neither be granted nor withheld at the will of the political self-interests of others. For it is enshrined in all international charters and humanitarian law. We claim this right. We firmly assert it here before you and in the eyes of the rest of the world.   For it is a sacred and inviolable right which we shall relentlessly pursue and exercise with dedication and self-confidence and pride. Let's end . . . this unnatural condition of occupation, which has already claimed too many lives.   No dream of expansion or glory can justify the taking of a single life. Set us free to re-engage as neighbors and as equals on our holy land. To our people in exile and under occupation who have sent us to this appointment, laden with their trust, love and aspirations, we say that the load is heavy and the task is great, but we shall be true.   In the words of our great national poet, Mahmoud Darwish, \\"My homeland is not a suitcase and I am no traveler.\\"   To the exiled and the occupied, we say you shall return and you shall remain and we will prevail, for our cause is just. We will put on our embroidered robes and kaffiyehs and in the sight of the world and celebrate together on the day of liberation.   Refugee camps are not fit for people who had been reared on the land of Palestine in the warmth of the sun and freedom. The hail of Israeli bombs almost daily pouring down on our defenseless civilian population in the refugee camps of Lebanon is no substitute for the healing rain of the homeland. Yet the international will had insured their return in United Nations Resolution 194, a fact willfully ignored and unenacted.   Similarly, all other resolutions pertinent to the Palestinian question, beginning with Resolution 181 through Resolutions 242 and 338, and ending with Security Council Resolution 681, have until now been relegated to the domain of public debate rather than real implementation. They form the larger body of legality, including all relevant provisions of international law within which any peaceful settlement must proceed. FAROUK AL-SHARAA     The peoples of the entire world and not only the peoples of our region are buffeted by conflicting feelings toward this conference, feelings fluctuating between success and failure, between optimism in achieving peace and the pessimism of a regression to conflict and confrontation.   It is no exaggeration to state that the continuing intransigent Israeli position which is bereft of any justification is the one that places the world on the brink of incalculable dangers and prevents the region from enjoying peace.   The Arabs throughout their long history have always advocated peace, justice and tolerance. Their history, both ancient and modern, abounds with evidence to that effect. The Jews and oriental Jews in particular know better than anyone that they have lived among Muslim Arabs throughout history, wherever they happen to coexist, without ever suffering any form of persecution or discrimination, either racial or religious.   Rather, they have always lived in grace and dignity, participating in all walks of life. The Jews have never known a level of security, tolerance and equality approximating the security, tolerance and equality they have enjoyed in the lands of Arabs and Muslims.   Anyone perusing the pages of history today would realize the blatant contrast between this tolerance and full equality with which the Arabs treated the Jews for hundreds of years on the one hand, and the persecution, injustice and discrimination inflicted on the Arabs and particularly Palestinian Arabs languishing on the Israeli occupation on the other.   Suffice it to recall if only such a reminder were heeded, that had Israel's political orientation since 1948 been humane, millions of Arabs, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese would not have been uprooted from their homes nor -- nor would they have been denied, until today, their right to return. Had Israel's policies not been settler-colonialist, Palestinians languishing in the Israeli occupation since 1967 would not have been denied all their fundamental rights, foremost among which is their right to self-determination. . . .   The list of evidence of inhumane Israeli practices is long and well documented. These are practices which were condemned by dozens of resolutions adopted by the United Nations. These are practices of which the Israelis are tacitly cognizant themselves. They are known to many a fair-minded historian and journalist in the West. Although some do not dare address these practices frankly and unequivocally, for reasons which are, regrettably, not known to wide sections of European and U.S. public opinion. First, among these reasons is that Jewish extremists, both inside and outside Israel, harass those writers and journalists and jeopardize their livelihoods and future.   If they happen to be Christian, they're accused of being anti-Semitic, but if they are Arabs and Muslim, it is easiest to accuse them without any evidence whatsoever of terrorism and the intention of destroying Israel. Usurping Aggressors     Contrary to every law known, the burden of proof in the minds of these extremists is incumbent on the accused. Thus, the innocent becomes a suspect in the eyes of a large sector of Western public opinion. The aggressors who have usurped the land of others by force, thus, become the advocates of peace. Whereas, the victims of aggression, who demand the return of their occupied land and their usurped rights, become terrorists and destructive warmongers.   Distinguished co-chairmen, we have never carried the banner of war and destruction. Syria has consistently called for the achievement of comprehensive and just peace on the basis of United Nations resolutions. We have always emphasized our sincere intention and serious desire for peace.                    . . .         Peace and the usurpation of the land of others cannot coexist. For peace to be stable and durable, it must encompass all parties to the conflict on all fronts. Developments in our region have proved this fact. Israel exploited the signing of its peace with Egypt in 1979 to then proceed to annexing Jerusalem in 1980, the Golan in 1981 and invading Lebanon in 1982. It is clear that Israel perpetrated this series of aggressive acts at a pace that exceeds the pace of its withdrawal from the Egyptian Sinai.   In the aftermath of each act of aggression, the Security Council was called upon to convene and resolutions were unanimously adopted: Resolution 476, declaring the annexation of Jerusalem as null and void, Resolution 497, declaring the imposition of Israeli laws in the Golan as being null and void and with no international legal validity, and Resolution 425, calling for unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.   However, as was the case with Resolutions 242 and 338, these resolutions were not implemented at the time, due to Israel rejection and intransigence and due to the atmosphere of the cold war between East and West. . . .   It is noteworthy to point out in this context the Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, on the basis of which the peace conference is being convened, were adopted as a compromise between the permanent member states of the Security Council. As is well known, the majority of those states have been sympathetic to Israel since its creation.   Hence, the implementation of these two resolutions should not be the subject of new bargaining during bilateral negotiations. Rather, they should be implemented in all provisions and on all fronts. Resolution 242 emphasizes in its preamble the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war.   This means that every inch of Arab land occupied by the Israelis by war and force, the Golan, the West Bank, Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, must be returned in their entirety to their legitimate owners.   International public opinion is aware more than ever before, and especially following the gulf crisis, that double standards are no longer acceptable in this age, that the principles of international law, not the law of the jungle, must be respected and that United Nations resolutions, not brute force, must be applied. Uprooting of Syrians     At last, the states of the world have also come to realize that Israel alone resists the efforts for peace with all the influence it can muster. It is Israel which perpetuates its occupation of the territories of others by force. All have come to realize that Israel follows a futile and obsolete ideology based on annexation, the building of settlements and the uprooting of Arabs from land in which they had lived for centuries in order to replace them with new immigrants who have never lived in this region.   In this regard, Syria would like to remind the co-sponsors of the conference and through them the international community that Israeli occupation of Syrian and Palestinian territories has resulted in uprooting approximately half a million Syrian citizens from the Golan who have to date not been able to return. The occupation has also resulted in the presence of over a quarter-million Palestinian refugees in Syria who are denied the right to return to the homeland of their fathers and forbears in Palestine.   The claims invoked by Israel for the migration of world Jewry to it at the expense of the native Arab population are not sanctioned by any legal or humanitarian principle. If the entire world were to adopt such claims, it would have to encourage all Christians to emigrate to the Vatican and all Muslims to emigrate to Holy Mecca.                    . . .         In order for a just peace to be established, no Arab land must remain under Israeli occupation, nor can the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination remain denied. If the objective is truly for the peoples and the states of the region to co-exist, to enjoy security, peace and prosperity, to place their plentiful energies and resources at the service of their . . . development, how can such a desirable objective logically be realized without eliminating occupation and restoring legitimate rights?                    . . .         This firm Syrian position, whose every element is anchored in the principles of international legitimacy and the resolutions of the United Nations -- that position deems it imperative for Israel to withdraw from every inch of the occupied Syrian Golan, the West Bank, Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the south of Lebanon.   This position also deems it imperative to safeguard the legitimate, political and national rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among which is their right to self-determination. The building of settlements in the occupied Arab territories is an illegal action. It is considered null and void, and it stands as a major obstacle in the way of peace.   Thus, it is imperative that the settlements be removed. The continuation of settlement activity in the Arab-occupied territories, particularly since the peace process has commenced, is tangible evidence that Israel does not want to reach genuine peace. 3 Speeches: The Area Is 'a Dangerous Battleground' - The Syrians 'Have Never Carried the Banner of War'"},{"year":"1991","title":"Following are excerpts from speeches today at the Middle East peace conference by the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir","excerpt":"the leader of the Palestinian delegation, Haidar Abdel-Shafi, and the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.

Their new French film would seem to be a perfect high romance. It tells the story of a fair pretender to the throne of Russia's Catherine the Great, of the handsome officer sent to Venice to effect her capture, of their meeting, their loving, their theoretically tragic end.On the face of it, \\"Betrayal\\" promises to be another \\"Zenda\\" or \\"Mayerling.\\" But what a long face the French have put upon it! The romance moves with the decorum of a court processional","excerpt":"the leading man is about as impetuous as a banker extending a mortgage date; the heroine bears her tragedy as though she had just come off second in the Atlantic City beauty parade—possibly with still greater fortitude.It is a rich production, in fact an ornate production, but so long as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is lighting our Western skies we need not go all the way to France for opulence. The film is completely devoid of humor and so colorless in its performance that frankly we didn't give a hang whether Catherine hanged the lovers or not. Suzy Prim's Catherine, incidentally, was the only bright performance in the show. Annie Vernay as the pretender Elizabeth is a pretty blonde, just the sort to play Judge Hardy's daughter. Pierre Richard-Willm as the dashing Count Orloff is not the dashing type at all, certainly not in those hip boots anyway. Sorry to yawn this way in public.At the 86th St. Garden TheatreUsing the time-honored recipe of the famous author of love stories purporting to be based on his personal experiences who finally falls victim to the charm of a lovely young country girl who despises his novels, with the resultant merry complications, Carl Boese has directed \\"Der verkannte Lebemann\\" (The Unrecognized Man of the World), the new Bavaria film at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre, so skillfully that the audience is kept laughing most of the time.Ralph Arthur Roberts makes the \\"hero\\" fairly credible, while Trude Marlen is entirely convincing as his eventual bride. Hilda Sessack does well in the role of a hero-worshiping chambermaid finally content to catch his valet (Theo Lingen). Grete Weiser is gay as usual, even though she is cast as the actress who loses the author and has to put up with Kurt Vespermann as a consolation prize. There is plenty of action, with scenes in the theatre and at a grand masquerade ball, as well as lots of wisecracks.At the Modern PlayhouseGathering roses, not from bushes but from the hands of more or less fair damsels, is the principal occupation of the popular Antal Pager in \\"Fehervari Huszarok\\" (Hussars of Fehervari), the pleasing little Magar importation at the Modern Playhouse. This is because an attractive young baroness (Maria Egry) living on a near-by estate, with whom he has fallen in love, sets him the task of earning seven roses in seven consecutive days in seven villages from seven girls, by honest work.Naturally, with the help of his former orderly, the ex-lieutenant of hussars makes good, in spite of amusing sabotage tricks by Julius Kaboa, as an irritated music teacher, and a half-hearted attempt to fool him by the heroine herself. Martin Keleti, director of this Kino Film production, has introduced several nice musical numbers and numerous fine rural scenes.At the Teatro HispanoAnother well-made and interesting Argentine picture entitled \\"Viento Norte\\" (North Wind) is meeting with the approval of the patrons of the Teatro Hispano. Smoothly directed by Mario Scoffici and acted by a first-rate cast, this Argentina Sono Film production brings some new variations to the theme of filial devotion to a none too worthy parent.As the fine young gaucho willing to face a firing squad rather than betray a father (Orestes Caviglia) who has killed his mother's one-time admirer (Elias Alippi) in a fit of drunken, unfounded jealousy, Enrique Muiño gives an excellent performance. Rosita Contreras is very \\"simpatica\\" as the rich girl determined to marry the poor youth, despite family opposition. The most difficult role, that of the middle-aged wife and mother, is filled by Camila Quiroga practically to perfection.Timed about half a century ago, the action provides many entertaining views of army and civilian life on the vast pampas at that period.

The early consensus is that there is no consensus, unlike the Pac-10, which appears to be leaning toward hiring the former Stanford athletic director Ted Leland.The best list I could scrape together includes the senior associate commissioner John Marinatto, the associate commissioner Nick Carparelli, the associate commissioner Dan Gavitt, Louisville Athletic Director Tom Jurich and Connecticut Athletic Director Jeff Hathaway. Don’t be surprised if a dark horse emerges, though. Marinatto would be considered the favorite, but there’s a lot of golf left to play.The co-chairmen in charge of the search are the Pittsburgh president, Mark A. Nordenberg, and the Georgetown president, John J. DeGioia. Nordenberg checked in by phone to talk about the process. Here are a few highlights.He called it a “critical hire” because of all the hard work Tranghese had done to position the Big East among the B.C.S. conferences after the defections to the A.C.C. Nordenberg played down the notion of whether the candidate would be a football or basketball guy","excerpt":"the league has eight football-playing members and 16 in basketball.“In terms of the general functioning of the conference today, I don’t really sense that tension as a constant part of life,” Nordenberg said. “Clearly both sports are very important to us. It would be hard to imagine that we would recommend someone not committed to both and a capable leader in terms of pushing both sports forward.”Football is generally given priority in college sports because it generates more television and ticket revenue.Nordenberg didn’t give a whole lot of hints as to what type of candidate the Big East would be looking for. Tranghese said in his teleconference to announce his impending retirement that he’d prefer his replacement to be someone familiar with the Big East. Nordenberg said that he understood that thinking but that the league would be open to outside candidates as well.Nordenberg said the league would begin a “deliberate” search once the school year begins and said that Tranghese had shown flexibility in moving forward.“Mike has been totally himself,” Nordenberg said, “indicating that his own personal plans can be adjusted to the needs of the conference. That is, if we find someone early, he’ll leave early. If it takes long, and that means extending his time, he can adjust to that as well. We’re not locked into any time frame.”Stay tuned to what will surely be one of the most intriguing hires in college sports this year.

I don't think we'll be seeing that commercial anymore. Last week, Israel's Foreign Minister, David Levy, went to Gaza and warmly shook hands with Mr. Arafat on behalf of Benjamin Netanyahu's new Government. As Israeli commentators noted the next day, \\"There was no sound of broken glass.\\"         The sound you do hear coming out of Israel these days is the sound of Mr. Netanyahu bumping up against the reality of the peace process. So far, the new Israeli Prime Minister seems to be trying to avoid doing anything that would derail the peace process, while at the same time avoiding anything that might advance it and cause a split in his right-wing party. He is clearly probing for  how far he can go toward implementing his campaign rhetoric without blowing up the peace process that has brought Israelis so many tangible economic benefits and openings to the world, which they don't want to sacrifice. Only when Mr. Netanyahu finishes probing and starts making decisions, or faces a crisis, will  we know whether he is just a more articulate version of Yitzhak Shamir, only capable of treading water, or a Menachem Begin, capable of historic decisions, even though they might cause splits within his party and people.

After the defeat of Germany, which occupied Lithuania in World War II, the Soviet Union re-established its control in 1945 only to be faced in the following decades with a popular independence movement called Sajudis. Voters rejected the Communist Party when they elected a Parliament in February 1990","excerpt":"the legislators then chose a non-Communist Premier and voted to have Lithuania secede from the Soviet Union.  History    There are accounts of distinct Lithuanian tribes going back to the first century A.D. Under pressure from neighboring Germans, Lithuanian tribes united in the 13th century to form a powerful medieval state; a Polish-Lithuanian union established in the 14th century lasted 400 years. That period was followed by increasing Polish domination, which ended with the partition of Poland in 1795, when Lithuania was divided between Russian and Prussian control. A cultural renaissance and growing demands for Lithuanian autonomy followed the political upheaval that broke out in Russia in 1905; after a period of German occupation in World War I, the country became independent. In 1939, a mutual assistance treaty was signed in Moscow in which Lithuania was compelled to admit Soviet garrisons and grant air bases. On June 15, 1940, Moscow issued an ultimatum demanding creation of a \\"friendly\\" Lithuanian Government, followed the same day by occupation by the Red Army and incorporation into the Soviet Union within two months. Mass deportations of the intelligentsia, civil servants and others to Siberia followed. Lithuania was overrun by Germany during its attack on the Soviet Union, and remained occupied until the Soviet Union re-established its control as World War II drew to a close. The People    Ethnic Lithuanians make up about 80 percent of the republic's population of 3.6 million. There are also Russians, Poles, Jews, Byelorussians and Letts. The retention of the Lithuanian language, which belongs to the Baltic branch of the Indo-European family, has been a prime goal of the independence movement.  Geography    Lithuania is bounded on the west by the Baltic Sea and Poland, to the north by Latvia, and to the east and south by Byelorussia. The country covers 25,170 square miles, about the size of West Virginia.   The Economy    Before World War II, Lithuania's economy was mostly agricultural, but under Soviet control industrial development was stressed. Production of machine tools, household appliances, radio, television and tape-recording equipment, much of it destined for the Soviet market, has been emphasized. The country is dependent on other Soviet republics for gas and oil supplies, and this has given Moscow a strong measure of control over Lithuania.

Short Koreans Founder On Their Long Skates"},{"year":"1991","title":"USING heavy timbers to contain sloping ground or to make a terrace with steps is often easier, more attractive and less expensive than building with masonry. Six-by-six-inch timbers, usually eight feet long and called landscape ties, are a good choice for such projects. These are available at lumber yards and at many home supply stores and gardening centers.   The first step in virtually every project that involves containing or terracing sloping ground is to measure the slope's length, called the run, and its angle of incline, called the rise.   To determine these, drive a stake into the ground at the top of the slope, then tie a string to it at ground level and walk down to the bottom of the slope. There, pull the string taut and hang a line level (a vial containing a bubble, available at hardware stores) from it. Raise or lower the string until the bubble indicates that the string is level.   Extend a tape measure or yardstick vertically from the ground and read the distance at which it crosses the string. This distance is the rise","excerpt":"the length of the string is the run.   Often the rise is too great to measure with a yardstick; in that case, have a helper hold a long pole vertically while you measure the height of the string by standing on a stepladder. To make sure the pole is vertical, have the helper place a carpenter's level alongside it. If the slope is greater at one side of the area to be contained than at the other, use the larger measurement.   Generally, retaining walls two feet high or less are easiest for amateurs to build because little, if any, bracing is needed to counteract the pressure of the ground behind them; in many areas, walls higher than three feet require obtaining a building permit.   To cope with too great a rise, plan an arrangement of shorter intermediate walls, steps or terraces instead. The sum of their heights must equal the rise.   Ties forming the base of a wall are usually placed in a trench about two inches deep for stability; keep this in mind when calculating. To make adjustments to the heights of walls, ties can be buried deeper.   To build a single retaining wall, choose a spot near the base of the slope where a wall of convenient height (less than three feet) will extend higher than the rise at that level by an amount sufficient to contain the sloping soil on the downhill side of the wall. Later, this soil must be shoveled behind the wall to complete the project.   Dig a trench along this line. It may help to mark the direction of the trench with a stretched string fastened to stakes driven into the ground. The depth of the trench should extend at least four inches below the depth to which you plan to remove soil in front of the wall; normally soil is removed to grade level, which is the point from which the rise is measured.   Fill the trench with crushed stone for drainage to within two inches of the top. Then set the ties into the trench, end to end.   To anchor the ties, bore through each about two feet from the ends using a heavy-duty electric drill equipped with a 5/8-inch-diameter drill bit long enough to penetrate the tie. Then insert 15-inch lengths of half-inch-diameter steel reinforcing rod (available at building supply stores) into the holes and drive them into the ground with a sledgehammer.   If additional layers of ties are needed, place them on top of lower layers like bricks so that the ends of ties do not lie directly over those below. Fasten the layers by drilling and inserting eight-inch lengths of rod.   Often, ground slopes in two directions, creating a low point at one end of the slope and the need for two retaining walls that form a corner.   To build them, begin at the lowest corner of the site. Dig a trench across one slope, wide enough and deep enough to accommodate a tie and sufficient crushed stone. Use a stretched string with a line level attached as a guide to both direction and depth.   Whenever the ground rises, you must dig deeper than 12 inches (the thickness of a tie, plus two inches for stabilizing the tie above, plus four inches for crushed stone below).   Extend the trench about four inches, then start a new trench segment at that point by digging down only six inches. Continue at that depth until you reach the other end of the slope or must dig a higher segment.   Follow the same procedure to dig the trench for the adjacent wall, extending across that slope to the same height as the trench for the first wall.   When you are finished, add crushed stone and lay and anchor the ties as described, beginning at the lowest corner of the site. In the bottom tier, leave a gap of about four inches at the buried end of each tie. Fill the gap with crushed stone, creating a continuous layer of stone beneath the ties.   Making steps or terraces up a hill involves one or both of the previous techniques. Steps should be uniformly sized, 4 to 8 inches high for easy climbing. Terraces, which are usually broader and not necessarily designed to be used as steps, can be of varying and greater heights.   To divide a slope into uniform steps, divide the run in inches by a figure that yields a whole number. The number, minus one, is the number of steps needed. The amount by which the number must be multiplied to obtain the run is the distance in inches from the front of each step to the back.    For example, a run of 180 inches can be divided by six steps, each measuring 30 inches from front to back. However, only five steps project above grade; the top of the lowest step is even with the base of the slope.   To determine the height of each step, divide the rise by the number of steps projecting above grade. If the rise in the example is 30 inches, each of the five steps mentioned must be six inches high.

George and Raquel see each other every day at what they call \\"beach camp,\\" a summer program run by the town of Westport. Their host families also get together for barbecues and picnics.   The host families also keep in touch with the children during the school year. They try to keep track of how they are doing in school, to remember their birthdays and to bring them to Westport for special occasions, like Christmas and Thanksgiving.

''The Nobel committee has been very good at coming up with names that were not expected,'' Frederik Tygstrup, a professor of literature in Copenhagen, told Reuters. ''They will surprise us again.''

Others said to be in the running include Joyce Carol Oates and Milan Kundera. Francisco Toledo, perhaps Mexico's best-known living artist, has been named the winner of the $257,000 Right Livelihood Award for his efforts to protect the cultural heritage of his native state, Oaxaca, Reuters reported.

Robinson Jr., the chief judge of the Federal District Court in Washington, issued a permanent injunction ordering a monthly publication called Stock Market Magazine to cease publication until it had satisfied the S.E.C.'s requirement that it register as an investment adviser - in effect, until it gets a license from the agency.    The S.E.C. argued that the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 gives it the authority to regulate publications that are primarily devoted to investment advice.

He spends so much time and effort providing services for his constituents, he says, that some think he can solve almost any problem.   This emphasis on service is not entirely altruistic.

There was one stage, however, missing from this chronology: the glory years of a star. For Mr. Davies, a life in the limelight was derailed in the late 60's when he was temporarily banned from touring America and embroiled  in a series of lawsuits over music publishing.

Though the play is more of an embroidered conceit than a cogently worked out drama (as Mr. Margulies provided in last year's \\"Sight Unseen\\"), it generates its own enduring resonance as a study in the wistful, self-conscious fantasies that emerge from mundane lives.

It is a German film known as \\"Variety\\" and was produced by the Ufa concern in Berlin about a year ago under the direction of E. A. Dupont. In this picture there is a marvelous wealth of detail","excerpt":"the lighting effects and camera work cause one to reflect that occasionally the screen may be connected with art. While there may be some speculation concerning the appeal of this striking piece of work, because use of the tragic climax of the actual story, there is no doubt regarding its merit. Scene after scene unlocks a flood of thoughts, and although the nature of the principal characters is far from pleasing; the glimpses one obtains are so true to life that they are not repellent.Emil Jannings, who is best remembered for his acting in \\"The Last Laugh\\" and \\"Passion,\\" fills the principal rôle. He is theatric at times, but his performance is a masterly one. He is not alone in this feature, and it may be a matter of opinion as to whether Lya de Putti and Warwick Ward, an English actor, are not even better than Mr. Jannings in their portrayals. Certainly Jannings has the least conventional rôle and more to tell by his expressions. However, Miss de Putti and Mr. Ward give an extraordinarily brilliant account of themselves and they rise to the occasion in episodes that are by no means easy to handle.Benjamin Christianson's picture, \\"The Devil's Circus,\\" was much the same sort of story, but where that production missed the mark \\"Variety\\" supplies the interest and booms where the Hollywood photodrama spluttered.It is the story of the mésalliances in the lives of three trapeze performers, the locale being Berlin. The first scenes depict a convict, who hitherto had been unwilling to disclose the reason for the murder he had committed, suddenly unfolding the tale to the warden of the prison. He is impelled to do so by the mention of his wife, whom he had deserted for a girl with a comely face. This girl at first enjoys the life with the man, who is much older than she, but when a handsome English trapeze performer appears she falls in love with him. It is through a sketch on a marble top table in a café poking fun at him that the older man discovers the duplicity of the girl. He meditates how he will revenge himself on the Englishman. His first thought is to let the Englishman drop when he is doing his usual triple somersault, but he eventually decides that he will end the Britsh performer's life with a knife. The chronicle is pictured as the convict tells it.The picture is unfolded with unusual care, points being made when new characters are introduced. The director shows the Boss, as the hefty older man is called, a domesticated individual, who had given up his trapeze work because he had broken both legs. Then the Girl is introduced, and the Boss sways in his attentions to his baby and his wife to the arched eyebrows and brown eyes of the Girl. He finds admiration for youth and beauty too strong and soon he decamps with the Girl, going back to his old vocation, working in a carnival.The introduction of the English performer is distinctly lucid and clever, for first one perceives all the performers reporting for the opening of the Wintergarten, and then a Continental express is seen entering the Friedrichstrasse Station. The famous Artinelli, known in all the capitals of Europe for his daring as a trapeze performer, alights from the train and informs the Wintergarten manager that he can't put on his act because his brother fell during a show at the London Coliseum.Here one perceives Artinelli, as the Englishman is known, watching the Wintergarten show as one of the audience. He is spoken of as an artist in his line, and it irritates him to be on the wrong side of the stage. You see what he is looking at—the comic dwarfs, the dancing girls, the Japanese jugglers, the dazzling girl who does the light fantastic with her brawny partner and other scenes, every one of which is tellingly portrayed. The girl in shimmering rhinestones and white tights elicits marked attention, which fact is brought out through the opera glasses held by several men and women. Her form is shown in the lenses of the glasses. Artinelli joins up with the Boss and the Girl.The Boss, before the Girl's eyes fascinated Artinelli, had not lost his domestic trait, for when the Girl extends her stockinged foot and shows the Boss a hole in the toe of her stocking, he calmly takes the stocking, picks up a needle and proceeds methodically to darn the hole.Artinelli's surrender to the attractive girl is gradual and natural. The Boss, who had to go and see an old friend one night, leaves the two to enjoy the evening together. He wakes up at 3 in the morning and the Girl has not returned. Then an hour later. The Girl had crept into the room in the meantime.Miss de Putti, as the Girl, gives a marvelous portrayal of the deceitful little minx.Mr. Ward is glib and easy, just the type for a successful trapeze performer who is meticulous about his make-up, using rouges on his lips and penciling his eyebrows.This is a production which not only shows the way in which a story should be unfurled, but impresses one with the magic of the camera in picturing effects, such as the torrent of thoughts rushing through a maddened mind, and the views of the audience from the eyes of a hurtling trapeze performer.

Ford's Lincoln, played by a 34-year-old Henry Fonda with a long, prosthetic nose and an unruly forelock, is not a saintly figure out of a children's civics lesson -- or at least, he is that and something else, something quite darker and more difficult, at the same time.
