That's being demonstrated in the Roundabout Theater Company's handsome, wildly uneven revival, which, under the direction of Robert Falls, is risky to the point of wrongheadedness. The production opened last night at the Criterion Center Stage Right with a cast headed by William Petersen, Marsha Mason and, in her first Broadway appearance since \\"The Heiress,\\" the stunning Cherry Jones.         It may be that \\"The Night of the Iguana\\" invites misinterpretation. Standing  at the center of the play, his shaky hands outstretched as if pleading for benediction, is the most complex male character Williams ever wrote. He's the Rev. T.

Since his death his cult has spread, particularly among Mexican-Americans in south Texas","excerpt":"tens of thousands make a pilgrimage to his tomb every year. NINO FIDENCIO: A Heart Thrown Open (Museum of New Mexico Press, $34.95) presents a reverential look at the experiences of his contemporary followers through Dore Gardner's documentary photographs of the pilgrims, and through testimonials from the women who are his mediums. Frequently these women go to Nino Fidencio's shrine (often over the objections of their husbands) seeking to cure themselves or their children of debilitating illnesses after traditional medicine has failed. If they or their children are healed, the women often pay their debt by allowing Nino Fidencio's spirit to take over their bodies so that they may cure others, and by making the arduous pilgrimage to the remote village where he lived. Few who knew Nino Fidencio are still alive, and details about his life are vague and subject to constant revision by his devotees. An essay by the folklorist Kay F. Turner offers some historical and psychological insight into the cult, but more information would have been welcome, not only about Nino Fidencio but about his followers as well. For example, biographical sketches of the people giving testimonials might have made clear that many references to Nino Fidencio are actually about a medium who has taken on his spirit in a trance. However, this book offers a fascinating glimpse into a little-known phenomenon as well as a testament to the power of belief.
