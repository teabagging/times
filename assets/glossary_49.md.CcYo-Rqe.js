(University of Queensland Press/International Specialized Book Service, 5602 Hassolo Street N.E., Portland, Ore. 97213, Paper, $12.95.) In her latest novel, the Australian writer Barbara Hanrahan reveals her concerns with life's contradictions and the nature of memory, particularly memories of childhood. But while her previous books have featured women in Australian and English settings, in \\"Flawless Jade\\" she turns to the Far East of the 1940's and 50's, as seen through the eyes of a young Chinese girl, Wing-yee. Born during \\"the Japanese War,\\" Wing-yee lives through Mao Zedong's overthrow of Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist occupation of Canton. After fleeing with some of her family to an ostensibly better life in Hong Kong, she works as a servant, an embroiderer and, at 13, an usherette at the Golden Dragon Cinema. As time passes, Wing-yee's fantasies of returning to Canton gradually dissolve. She also experiences her first love -- and her first heartbreak. When she is 15, her mother crushes her aspirations to become an actress (she has sent a photograph to a movie company, using the name Flawless Jade), insisting that \\"unless you sold your body you couldn't become famous.\\" Wing-yee's story is a modest \\n\\nBildungsroman\\n\\n, a poetic account of political and personal tumult and the human will to survive, of its heroine's efforts to make \\"even my bitter memories . . . somehow sweet.\\" Ms. Hanrahan's book credibly portrays the stratified, male-dominated culture in which Wing-yee lives, a society in which, as she explains without self-pity, \\"a boy was better than a girl. . . . Girls were regarded as really quite useless.\\" Its plain, straightforward style affectingly conveys the menace and futility of her world. At the book's conclusion, though years have passed, Wing-yee still waits hopefully for her \\"better future\\" to begin, studying English and dreaming of Hollywood. While this future appears doubtful, the story she tells assures that she will transcend it. For, as Ms. Hanrahan implies, by expressing ourselves we can triumph over the constraints of both culture and history.

Skies are wide and high. The air is clear, with salt breezes blowing in from the ocean. The light is generosity made visible.   Indoors, the cut flowers never wilt and the washing up has always been done. Adults sit around with that look of good-natured puzzlement that characterizes many a WASP household on the Northeastern seaboard of this country. Children are clean-limbed and harbor only good thoughts. We see the inside of the house, and we see the outside of the house, and we find it hard to say which is the more seductive.   These paintings present us with an America in which pollution, family strife and even the notion of bad weather have no place. The more we know about painting, the more we recognize the exceptional daring of Porter's use of color and the freedom and energy with which he went to work with the brush. But the pictures look to the layman as if they had been painted the way a bird sings - naturally, without effort, and without interruption.

Watkins, whose 1861 views of Yosemite Valley helped convince Congress to pass legislation insuring its preservation. Watkins's pictures of Yosemite were not the first to be made there - that honor belongs to C.L. Weed, who photographed the valley in 1859 - but they were certainly the most awe-inspiring, having been made with a mammoth camera that produced 18-by-22-inch glass plate negatives. Besides shaping the contemporary conception of what Western terrain looked like, they have served as models of sublimity for landscape photographers ever since, from Eadweard Muybridge to Ansel Adams.   Despite his influence on American landscape photography, though, Watkins remained an overlooked figure as recently as 10 years ago.  It was only with the 1975 exhibition ''Era of Exploration: The Rise of Landscape Photography in the American West,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, that his achievements began to receive real attention. Indeed, his photographs in that show were of such impressive quality that they nearly eclipsed those of the four other major photographers included - Muybridge, Timothy O'Sullivan, William Henry Jackson and A.J. Russell. For many it became clear on the spot that Watkins ranked as one of the premier American landscape photographers of all time.
