A family memorial service will be held Tuesday, September 25, at 10 AM, at St. Elizabeth's Roman Catholic Church, Wyckoff, NJ, where Mr. Brady grew up. Mr. Brady, a first vice president and 16-year veteran of Merrill Lynch, is a member of Merrill Lynch's Director's Circle, a group made up of the firm's most successful producers. Because of his expertise, he routinely trained other financial advisors in the New York metropolitan area and elsewhere. ''David is a special person, beloved by his clients and his colleagues, regardless of rank,'' said Phil Sieg, Director of Mr. Brady's office. ''As mark of his kindness and expertise, David's client base, of about 150 families, is made up of virtually all long-term relationships.'' A devout Catholic, he attended Mass daily at a church in lower Manhattan near his office in the World Financial Center. Mr. Brady's wife, Jennifer, requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to: Butterflies Hospice Program at Valley Hospital Foundation, 233 North Van Dien Ave, Ridgewood, NJ 07451. The family will host friends and family at Arcola Country Club, Paramus, NJ, immediately following memorial service.

How can we find smaller, less-expensive hotels if accommodations have to be paid for in advance? And would it be better to rent a car in East or West Berlin? - M.C.H., Charleston, S.C. Answer:Yes, four older people could travel independently in East Germany, and having a German-speaking person in the party would certainly make it easier.   Visas, which cost about $6 each, may be secured through the embassy of the German Democratic Republic (1717 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036","excerpt":"202-232-3134). The essential requirement for the visa, in addition to having a valid passport, is confirmation of reserved hotel space. All requests for accommodations go through the Reiseburo der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik (Deutschen Demokratischen Republik 1026, Berlin PSF77), the official East German travel agency, in East Berlin. If you want less expensive rooms you should state a desired price range in your request, but you should be prepared for rates that may run from $30 to $50 a person a night that must be prepaid.

Although the hallmark of Waterloo since its founding in 1976 by Gerard Schwarz has been adventuresome repertory, Mr. Lipman made no bones about the festival's new strategy for hard times, a bid to attract larger paying audiences with more standard fare.

Although clearly intended as a sweeping overview, it is more a sweeping glimpse, partial, fragmented and confused.    The exhibition sets before the visitor nearly 300 works, created by more than 90 artists during the last 80 years. It begins with the Cubist canvases of the great Mexican artist Diego Rivera and ends with paintings and installation works by contemporary artists like Guillermo Kuitca, Julio Galan, Eugenio Dittborn and Alfredo Jaar, all of whom are increasingly and for the most part deservedly prominent on the international art circuit. In between, the exhibition seeks to demonstrate how the modernist ideas issuing from Paris, Moscow and Berlin in the early decades of this century ignited an amazing chain of indigenous reactions and permutations throughout Central and South America, as they did in other parts of Europe and in the United States.
