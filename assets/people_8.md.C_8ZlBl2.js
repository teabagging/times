Schumann requires a current of nervous agitation for which Miss Davidovich's  style is well suited, and she made much of this edginess in the Fantasiestucke (Op. 111) and the \\"Kreisleriana\\" (Op. 16).

Frank Lloyd Wright was a Mr. Everybody who gave himself the right to radiate. He was a genius of the conventional, a supreme artist of everyday living, a person with desires no different from anyone else's, but one who found a way to turn off all the No voices in his head and give bold, persistent voice to a resoundingly radiant American Yes.

In another architect's hand, the temple is a gentle, craggy presence, almost receding atop a hill that looms larger than the building itself. The first drawing was done in 1933 by Theodor K. Rohdenburg, the second in 1962 by Antoine Predock, and their juxtaposition cogently sums up the point of \\"The History of History in American Schools of Architecture 1865-1975,\\" a new exhibition at Columbia University's School of Architecture.   The icons that architects are inspired by - the great buildings they study as a central part of their training - mean altogether different things at different times, and the way a young architect interprets the buildings of the past can be as revealing as a Rorschach test. Mr. Rohdenburg, who was a student at Columbia in the years of modernism's ascendancy in the 1930's, seemed to see the Parthenon as a kind of proto-modern structure, more solid than most modern buildings but every bit as cool. To Mr. Predock, who went to architecture school in the 1960's and later achieved renown as a designer of buildings inspired by the regional architecture of the American Southwest, there was hardly any structure and surface to the Parthenon at all: it was all a matter of place, of seeing the temple as a part of the larger Acropolis. Hanging next to these two drawings of the Parthenon is a third, a watercolor of another Greek temple done in 1889 by the architect William Alciphron Boring, which sees its classical model in yet another way, as an ornate piece of decoration.   Each architect saw what he wanted to see, or what his era and his education taught him to see: to an architect trained in the lavish classicism of the Beaux-Arts, the Greek temple turned out like a Beaux-Arts building","excerpt":"an architect trained in modernism saw its modern qualities, and an architect whose career developed during the post-modern years saw the Parthenon in terms of its larger context. None were right or wrong: they were almost like the fable of the blind men and the elephant, each seeing only one aspect and believing it to be the whole.   There are other, equally striking, comparisons in this exhibition: a set of drawings of Beauvais Cathedral, including one by Louis Kahn from a 1944 symposium in which Kahn envisioned the incomplete cathedral finished in steel and glass, and a gentle, cartoonlike sketch from 1969 by Frances Halsband, who saw the cathedral in terms of line and form. There are even more dramatically contrasting views of Siena, including a 1906 etching by William Frederick Lamb that presents the Palazzo Communale as the centerpiece of a great urban sweep, and a 1936 drawing by Gordon Bunshaft, who had just graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology the year before, that presents the Palazzo in a close-up view, seeing it all in terms of solid, cool surface, startlingly like Mr. Bunshaft's own buildings many years later.   If only for these few drawings sharply juxtaposed in the center of the Arthur Ross Gallery at Buell Hall on the Columbia campus, the exhibition would be worth a visit. But \\"The History of History\\" - the title is cumbersome but accurate - contains another 130 drawings and photographs, plus a series of books that have influenced architects and architectural education. An introductory section reviews the icons, from the Greek temples that inspired the Beaux-Arts architects to the grain elevators that thrilled Le Corbusier; the body of the show consists of drawings made during each of the three periods the exhibit investigates, which are referred to as the Beaux-Arts, Origins of Modernism and Postwar Critical Reinterpretation.   It adds up to a rare event in architectural scholarship: a visually pleasing exhibition that makes an original point without descending to polemic. Organized by Gwendolyn Wright, director of Columbia's Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture, along with Janet Parks, curator of drawings at the Avery Architectural Library at Columbia (from whose remarkable archive most of the material came), the exhibit reminds us that no era had a monopoly on history, and that each age has interpreted the past anew.   Where \\"The History of History\\" makes its most important contribution is in reminding us that looking at history has always been a critical part of architectural education, even in ages in which the importance of history was denied. In the modernist period, the focus of the middle section of the show, history was held suspect, particularly by the architects and teachers of the Bauhaus and other modernist institutions, who argued that to delve too deeply into the buildings of the past would only stifle originality. Breaking with the past, not learning from it, was the goal.   Yet no one really did bury the past: it was always there, through the 1920's and 30's and 40's, and no architect could fail to be influenced by it. The reality of architectural practice has never been a matter of history versus innovation, but only a question of how history is interpreted, of what meanings are to be gleaned from the buildings of the past - or of how much the great buildings of history are to be seen as inspirations rather than as literal models.   Indeed, one of the more intriguing sub-themes running through the exhibition is the continual conflict between the view of history as something to be imitated and the view of history as providing a more subtle, less direct kind of influence. There are drawings here by students who were obviously assigned to copy classical details, and others by students who were told to interpret classical buildings much more freely; it is not hard to tell the difference between them - or to sense who had the more enlightening and pleasing kind of architectural education.   Ms. Wright and Ms. Parks made a deliberate decision to cut off the exhibition period at 1975, and not confront the issue in terms of architectural education today. The debate, after all, continues, and may even be entering a new phase (or a new swing of the pendulum?) right now. The post-modern years have been a time of vast receptivity to history on the part of architects. Inspired largely by Robert Venturi's 1966 book, \\"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture,\\" teachers and students alike brought history out of the closet, so to speak, and used it openly - sometimes literally, as in the skyscrapers of Philip Johnson and the shingled villas of Robert A. M. Stern, and sometimes more as a source for a more personal style, as in Mr. Venturi's own work or the work of an architect like Michael Graves. But now a younger generation has been moving back toward modernism, often with the same skepticism toward history that their architectural grandfathers possessed.   The exhibition, which marks the formal inauguration of the Arthur Ross Gallery, not to mention the renewed vigor of the Buell Center itself, will be on view through Nov. 3. It is by no means a history of contemporary architecture, but it does contain a number of splendid and rarely seen objects, such as a 1938 drawing by William Lescaze called \\"The House of the Future 2039\\" (except for the airplane on its roof, it looks as if it could have been called \\"The House of the Future 1939\\"); a marvelous drawing by Harvey Wiley Corbett of the temple of King Solomon that foreshadows all of Corbett's stepped-back skyscrapers of the 1920's, and a pair of original photographs of International Style skyscrapers from the Museum of Modern Art's celebrated International Style exhibition of 1932.

In this brightly pictured offering a young and impecunious Baron, who is smitten by the charms of an elderly manufacturer's young wife, undertakes to be crated and sent to the home of Herr Eickmeyer, the manufacturer, in place of a talking and singing life-size doll. He wears the costume of the mechanical puppet, and Herr and Frau Eickmeyer are at first greatly pleased with their purchase, which cost 5,000 marks.They pull the diferent strings to make the supposed puppet talk and sing, but the Baron is unwilling to give this satisfaction all the time, and, while Eickmeyer is looking up the numbers on the pamphlet, which came with the \\"puppet,\\" the good-looking young Baron is seized with an irresistible desire to sneeze, a qualification which is not included on the program. This, however, is passed over quickly, as Frau Eickmeyer, believing that her husband has sneezed, says \\"Prosit.\\" A fly also causes the Baron some slight annoyance.Soon the \\"puppet\\" begins to alarm Herr Eickmeyer, for the Baron is attacked with hunger pangs and when the Eickmeyers are out of the room he endeavors to get a morsel of food from a table. The manufacturer is more than a little surprised when he finds the \\"puppet\\" far closer to the table than when he had left him. He questions the maid and the butler as to whether they had moved the doll and both deny having done so.Eventually this Baron is wheeled to Frau Eickmeyer's boudoir, where he \\"comes to life,\\" but the young wife does not tell her husband or the servants, contenting herself by having the \\"puppet\\" locked in the bathroom.It is an ingenious little chronicle, the amusement of which increases when the Baron as himself appears in the Eickmeyer abode while the real puppet is there. Matters are worked out in such a way as to make the manufacturer almost glad to give up his pretty wife to the Baron.There are several tuneful songs in the course of the laughable happenings. The story is an adaptation of one that served an operetta also called \\"Der Hampelmann.\\"Max Hansen gives an engaging portrayal as the puppet. When he sings of his devotion to Frau Eickmeyer his voice is very real, but every now and again he changes it so that it is a sort of mechanical monotone.

How it got there is not germane at this point. What is relevant is that this seemingly inaccessible area, complete with opulent palace and fierce, masked Tuaregs, is ruled by a Circe with an insatiable yen for intrepid explorers, who, the yarn goes, keep turning up pretty regularly.But despite the fact that a couple of young, handsome officers of the French Foreign Legion arrive on the scene to be won, and then tragically cast aside by this royal temptress, the goings-on at Atlantis are far from exciting.

He proves it neatly, concisely and—save for one or two needlessly wistful passages—with a good deal of entertainment for even those who are not attorneys.\\"For the Defense\\" is built around the personality and professional activities of counsel for the underworld—as that had to creep in somewhere. It is the history of a man who shaved the corners rather close, but never hopped the curbstone. That is, he never did until his girl got mixed up in an affair. Then he bribed a juror, was arrested, pleaded guilty and started up the river for Sing Sing.It is essentially a New York picture. The opening scene is a dignified portrait of the Bridge of Sighs down on Centre Street, and there are subsequent items of the paradox called Broadway, and of the outside of the Tombs and criminal courts. Finally, for those whose inclinations run that way, there is a picture of Sing Sing's mysterious wall.Lest it be gathered from all this that \\"For the Defense\\" is merely a photographic tour of the city's points of (underworld) interest—it is not. There is a story present—one written by Oliver H. P. Garrett, who used to do them for newspapers—and a good deal of acting that is better and more appropriately attuned to life than most. The result of it all forms a relief from the run of night club gunmen chapters that after a time can be remembered only by number.Suavity being one of Mr. Powell's film characteristics, it is almost needless to say that William Foster's manner is just that. He remains calm through the bad moments of other people's trials, and through his own—which probably is the test. Both the police and what appears to be the Bar Association (at least there is a banquet and a good deal of speaking) are investigating him, but he goes on his own way quite calmly.Then the trouble begins. His girl in an effort to make him pealous, goes out with a coon-coatish person, and the car kills a man at the side of the road. The person mutters (\\"the papers will be full of this\\"), and so persuades the girl to flee. She, in turn, persuades Mr. Foster to take the case. A ring is introduced during the trial, so the attorney discovers all. In a moment of intoxication he orders a bit of jury bribing—and the rest is history.Mr. Powell carries on his rôle well, as does Kay Francis as the lady of the case. Scott Kolk wears the coon coat, and James Finlayson provides a good bit in the person of the juror who gets $2,000 for \\"holding out.\\" Thomas E. Jackson is Daly, a detective, and in \\"For the Defense\\" dodges about like something out of the Fates.On the Paramount's stage is an affair called \\"Varietrix.\\" A part of this is named \\"Rhythm Hotel\\" which features five who are billed as the \\"Sizzling Syncopators.\\" Also in the stage show are The Kemmys, Gifford and Gresham and the Foster Aerobatic Girls.

It is an adaptation of the play, \\"Nightstick,\\" and is known on the screen as \\"Alibi.\\" Except where the director, Roland West, aims to draw tears by the sight of a dying detective, the scenes in this picture move swiftly and surely. It is by far the best of the gangster films, and the fact that it is equipped with dialogue makes it all the more stirring. It also possesses the qualification of sticking to life, for the chief gunman in this instance is not whitewashed but stays a gunman. Moreover, through a trick that is not especially original, this killer shows that he is yellow.Mr. West has endowed this production with telling direction. He gives to most of his scenes something new, whether he is dealing with glimpses in prison or with those in Police Headquarters. His work possesses color with a minimum of the conventional motion picture flashes. His characters appear to mean what they say and all of them are portrayed with considerable intelligence.Another creditable point about this dialogue film is the sensible manner in which Mr. West has made use of his camera to give to his work an entertaining moving picture flavor. It is, as a matter of fact, constantly changing, from scenes in a theatre to those in a night club, to others in Police Headquarters and in the hiding place of the murderer.So far as the incidental sounds are concerned, Mr. West also avails himself of various ideas that give credibility to his chronicle. When a taxicab engine is running, the noise is really like the real thing, and the same applies to other sounds.In the first scene, convict 1065 is perceived being released from jail. At that moment one is prepared to see this jailbird, Chick Williams, go straight. But he happens to be a dyed-in-the-wool gunman, and Chester Morris, who plays this part, does splendid acting in the transition from the man who loves to the man who kills. He depicts in an able fashion the terror that strikes to Chick's heart when he faces Tommy Glennon's pistol.It is Danny McGann, an able young sleuth who poses as a broker, who uncovers a flaw in Chick Williams's alibi after the shooting of a policeman. Danny pretends to be intoxicated and he outwits the gunmen until a few moments before the police arrive. His deception is revealed through a girl calling up the same telephone number he had called. Chick wanted to use the supposed broker to fill in the five minutes of his alibi.Regis Toomey as McGann does some sterling acting, and although a dying scene is a little too drawn out, his work is always convincing. McGann is shot in the back by Chick Williams, who appears to kill most of his victims in that manner.One can skip from sequence to sequence and find something that is set forth with skill and imagination. During a passage at Police Headquarters Tommy Glennon and Pete Manning are depicted trying to wrench a confession from a taxi-driver named Soft Malone. The two policemen employ some of the late Inspector Byrnes's methods. The same question is fired time and again at Malone until the scene fades out and one is fairly certain that the pathetic specimen of humanity will squeal.Mr. West switches from a scene such as this to one of dancing girls, and then he shows the methodical, persevering McGann jumping into a taxicab. McGann drives to the scene of the murder and then returns to the theatre. He knows, and you know that he knows, that Chick Williams could have been at the theatre and also that during the brief intermission he had time to commit the crime.There are occasions when the voices change a little in tone, but in most of the scenes Mr. West has even used whispers.Mae Busch, who was in \\"The Unholy Three,\\" does quite well as the crook's companion. Harry Stubbs is believable as a well-fed member of the underworld. Eleanor Griffith, as the blond daughter of a policeman, is not particularly capable in speaking her lines.

But it is the wild, craggy grandeur of the natural backgrounds that saves the day for supposedly the first feature-length color picture to be made in Australia.As directed and produced by Charles Chauvel, yesterday's arrival at the Forty-sixth Street Embassy relates how an aborigine orphan, raised by a white family of cattle ranchers, succumbs to the lure of the wild and meets a tragic fate. The same, with all due respect to the plucky, talented Mr. Chauvel, applies to most of the footage, obviously shot under backbreaking conditions and in dead earnest.Mr. Chauvel begins by using exactly the same durable format that produced his worthy \\"40,000 Horsemen\\" and \\"The Rugged O'Riordans\\" in a land he obviously knows well. Using a hand-picked cast for his ranchers and their primitive dark-skinned workers, he alertly frames them in stark scenic simplicity and sentitively unravels the plot he and his wife Elsa have concocted.These opening scenes are dandy, as the infant flowers into young womanhood in a loving household. Sheltered from primitive tribal influences by her foster parents, she becomes engaged to a fine young ranchhand of mixed blood. The faces and behavior of these four people—Narla Kunogh and Paul Reynall, as the youngters, and Betty Suttor and George Simpson-Little, as the parents—are wonderfully appealing.For some rather obscure reason, Miss Kunogh abrupty runs off with a weird-looking tribal barbarian from the hills, played by Robert Tudewali, who turns up on the ranch. For this frightening specimen, the heroine exchanges a happy life, a happy fiancé and even a happy knack for playing Mozart (and well) on the piano. About ten minutes later, with the invader dragging her across the terrain like a rag roll, she changes her mind. And the chase by her loved ones, is on.These scenes, unfortunately the bulk of the action, are slow, drawn-out, meaningless and painfully familiar, and they soundly squash the initial worth of the proceedings. Meanwhile, the scenery thrusts up with increasing majesty. And for once, the heroine sails off a cliff with the villain.What made Jedda run? It beats us, and the same goes for Mr. Tudewali's herculean task in dragging her deep into the hills. Maybe he just halted Mozart.

The story, however, is so drenched with agony that it is seldom convincing. It is a one-sided affair in which the woman who becomes known as Lena Smith, because of her unwieldy Hungarian name, is buffetted from pillar to post in an extravagantly harsh fashion. Most of the time she is cowed by both circumstances and individuals and when she does assert herself it is never with sufficient force to gain the upper hand. It is quite obvious that her destiny is controlled at all times by the author's pen, irrespective of what might happen in everyday life.Esther Ralston, charming and graceful though she is, is miscast in the rôle of Lena Smith, for while Miss Ralston is able to rise to the occasion in a lighter type of story, she does not succeed in expressing the emotions of the Lena Smith on all occasions, especially when it comes to her appearance before an Austrian military court.Lena Smith is pretty enough to be a handicap to the plot, for her very looks preclude the possibility of many of the happenings in this blue melodrama. Every man's hand, with one exception, is raised against Miss Smith, or as it should be, Schmidt, for the reason that she has committed the heinous offence of marrying \\"above her station,\\" which should really be interpreted: agreeing to become the wife of an ignoble young officer. Miss Smith is a Hungarian peasant, who, at the opening of the story, is filled with the joy of living. She is most attractive in her voluminous garments.Lieutenant Franz Hoffrat ceases to take an interest in Lena after her child is born, despite the fact that she is his bride. She works as a maid-of-all-work in the Hoffrat house, ruled by a bigoted father who has for years forgotten how to smile. He challenges the idea of any one ringing a doorbell at the noon hour and takes a siesta immediately after luncheon. Gustav von Seyffertitz gives an impressive performance as this Herr Hoffrat.James Hall plays the caddish officer, who, to nobody's chagrin, eventually puts a bullet through his head. Mr. Hall smiles and sneers through the part and does not obtain nearly as much out of it as one might reasonably expect. It is with Mr. Hall that Josef von Sternberg falls down in his direction, which, for the most part, is good enough. There are passages in this film that appear to be something on the order of childhood reminiscences, but they are not set forth with any suggestion of whimsicality.

But for these artists and critics, it's a personal landmark. Here's how it affected them.    SARAH JESSICA PARKER, Actress      When I was first in ''Annie'' on Broadway -- that was 1978 -- there was a great line in the show: ''You'll stay up until this floor shines like the top of the Chrysler Building.'' That was my first real image, how it sparkled in the skyline.     When my husband and I were courting, we used to walk everywhere, from Battery Park to the Chrysler Building, and we went into the lobby, quite late at night, many, many times -- summer nights and cold nights. That magnificent lobby, a far superior lobby to the Empire State Building.     The Empire State Building symbolized what I think we wanted in coming to New York: to be New Yorkers and to thrive in the city. The Chrysler Building was this magnificent piece of art. It was a sand castle. You could imagine that the sand was wet, and you were shaping it with your fingers.    MATTHEW BARNEY, artist and filmmaker  Wrote, directed and acted in the ''Cremaster'' film series.      I spoke with Jerry Speyer and his daughter, Valerie Speyer Peltier, about ''Cremaster 3,'' and they very graciously granted me permission to shoot in the elevator car interiors, the staircase between the arcade level and the lobby and most significantly the floors beneath the finial. The maypole scene was shot in that space, as well as the final murder scene between the architect and the apprentice.     The building would catch my eye from its numerous sightlines. I felt like it was laughing at me for the numerous small failures during the production. Now I've come to terms with the building. It feels like an ex-girlfriend.    ROBERT A.M. STERN, architect  Dean of the Yale School of Architecture","excerpt":"an author of a book series that began with ''New York 1900'' and will include ''New York 2000,'' to be published next year.      I was a Brooklyn boy, about 7, 8 or 9. It was the late 40's, and Dad takes young lad to see the cars. The Chrysler cars were still being displayed in great, glamorous, dark showrooms, in curved-glass windows, which were recessed so that there would be no reflection on the glass. You would look inside, and there was a car that turned around.     The Chrysler Building caught the exuberance and the spirit of the 1920's in a way that no other building in the world has. That's what we love: its swagger and originality. We live in a timid age in comparison. The critics didn't like it, to which I say boo on the critics. You know that old song ''Ain't We Got Fun?'' I don't think critics had fun. The Depression derailed a lot of architects.    Chrysler built it, and he had the showrooms in it, he embellished the outside with symbols that were explicit with his hubcaps, his radiator hood ornaments, and when Chrysler moved out, Texaco moved in.    And they couldn't change the name of the building to Texaco. It's Chrysler inside and out.     We don't have buildings today that express the identity of the client, like Saarinen did with the T.W.A. building. I want to save the Edward Durell Stone building. It is what it is. It's history. The ideas of Huntington Hartford and the ideas of Mr. Stone were united.    In the 1990's, Walt Disney was building the animation building in Burbank, for which I was the architect. I took courage and inspiration from many things, not the least of which was the swagger and iconographic self-confidence of the Chrysler Building.    RON CHERNOW, author  Wrote ''Alexander Hamilton'' (Penguin Press, 2004) and ''Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.'' (Random House, 1998)      As a teenager growing up in Queens, the Chrysler Building was one of those Art Deco skyscrapers shimmering on the Manhattan skyline, beckoning people from the outer boroughs.    I've always been torn as to which is my favorite skyscraper, the Empire State or the Chrysler Building. It's a hard decision, because the Empire State has this elegant poise and majestic air of calm and beauty. The Chrysler Building has a different silhouette. It's jazzy and electric and jagged, the beautiful but brash cousin. The Empire State Building expresses the daytime personality of the city: power and business. The Chrysler Building appeals to the night, to the fantasy life of the city in its glitz and glamour.     What's fascinating and consistent about the Empire State Building, the Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building is that they were conceived during the giddiest part of the 1920's boom and were completed during the bust, and they embody the dizzying hopes of the 1920's and reflect the dismal reality of the 1930's, the Depression and the collapse of the Manhattan real estate market.     Automobile ownership tripled in the 1920's, so auto stocks were to the stock market what Intel and Microsoft were to the boom of the 1990's. If someone said what kind of company built that building, you'd say, ''Oh my god, it was a car company.'' It was a time when the car claimed the American imagination, and it was land transport soaring off into the clouds.    STEPHEN BENNETT PHILLIPS  A curator at the Phillips Collection; organized the traveling exhibition ''Margaret Bourke-White: The Photography of Design, 1927-1936.''      Bourke-White, when she was in Cleveland, became a well-known industrial photographer. The Chrysler Corporation got to know her, and they hired her to photograph the final construction of the building from 1929 to 1930. She was on scaffolding and on towers about 800 feet off the ground. It got windy, and the scaffolding swayed from side to side. The assignment gave her the idea that she wanted to live in the Chrysler Building: she wanted the best address.     At the same time Henry Luce had hired her to be the photographer for Fortune magazine.    The only person who can live in the building is the janitor. She had such chutzpah, she applied for the job as janitor. She finds that the job has been filled by someone else, so she had to live someplace else and could only have her studio in the Chrysler Building.    Bourke-White doesn't want just any apartment there. She wants the 61st floor, the terrace where two of the gargoyles are. She is a woman photographer, and there was a bias about that, that she'd get married, have a baby, quit a job. Fortune wouldn't rent her the space on her own, even though she was making tens of thousands of dollars. Her lease had to be cosigned by Time Inc. Isn't that amazing? She paid $387.92 per month, plus electricity -- that was a lot of money back then -- and hires her good friend, John Vassos, an industrial designer, to create an Art Moderne stylish interior, with extensive built-ins, subdued palette, woods and metals.     There was a main sitting area, an alcove for her desk, stairs that go out to the terrace. The superintendent reminded Bourke-White that her lease did not include access to the terrace, and she wrote back, ''Of course.'' But she invited businessmen whom she wanted to befriend to have cocktails on the terrace.     Bourke-White's early interest in college and high school was herpetology: snakes, turtles. She had a fish tank in her studio and lots of creatures. Some friends coming back from Florida brought her two pet alligators, which she kept on the terrace. She had an aluminum pond constructed there.    By 1932, the Depression was hitting hard, Fortune magazine is cutting back on what they're paying photographers and she's falling behind in her rent.    In 1934 she falls very far behind, owing $6,000, and is evicted. She found cheaper studio space on 521 Fifth Avenue. The alligators got fairly large, but she took them with her.    ADA LOUISE HUXTABLE  Architecture critic, The Wall Street Journal.      I was born in Manhattan, and I was always aware of the Chrysler Building as part of the New York landscape. I just accepted it.    It wasn't until I was at the Museum of Modern Art, where I was assistant curator of architecture while I was still in graduate school, that I learned there was a split, a line drawn depending on whether you accepted the Chrysler Building as a good example of Modernism. That was the late 1940's, and Modernism, as it was being exhibited and promoted by the Museum of Modern Art, was based on a functionalist aesthetic.     And the Chrysler Building is not a functional aesthetic. It's a wonderful, decorative, evocative aesthetic, a lot more to do with Deco. But it was considered out of bounds by the Museum of Modern Art, an aberration.     I think it's magnificent. Anybody in his right mind loves that building.    PAUL GOLDBERGER  Dean, Parsons School of Design, and architecture critic for the New Yorker.      I grew up in the suburbs, and I just remember seeing it from afar for a long time, not going into it. And then going into its magical lobby.    The lobby has this compressed, intense energy: the dark red-orange marble, and the way the space works as a funnel, pushing you through. It's not a grandiose experience, it's not like Radio City Hall, but it has this concentrated density that's amazing.     The elevators are magnificent. Each is a different pattern of wood inlay, so it's like a fugue, a whole series of variations on a theme.     The view is magical, but the sad thing about the view is that it doesn't include the Chrysler Building.    ALEXANDROS WASHBURN, architect  Staff member to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 1994 to 1996; president of Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation, 1996 to 2000. In 1996, for eight months, he worked in Moynihan's New York headquarters on the 62nd floor.      In Washington's terms, people thought I was nuts to leave the heart of power, but the office was in the Chrysler Building. The rent was low, $31 a square foot, or 5,000 square feet for $150,000 a year. It was at the level of the stainless steel eagle. I had an office in the southeast corner of the 62nd floor. My office was huge, 1,000 square feet.    Senator Moynihan had the office that had the southern exposure, in the center of the building, the pair of windows looking due south over the entire Manhattan. He had Shaker furniture and a chair from the Nixon White House that said ''Counselor to the President.''    His social routine was he'd fly in to La Guardia in the morning; we'd pick him up at the La Guardia shuttle and drive him in to the Chrysler Building, give him the morning papers, and he'd attend to his memos and write a little. You had to have read all the papers, cover to cover, word for word.    You'd expect his call at 9:15 a.m., and you'd have a morning of madness, demanding memos, and get me Mr. Secretary of the Treasury, and get me the mayor, and then there'd be the blessed lunch at Bemelmans at the Carlyle.     He was religious about lunch.     I'd always have the turkey sandwich, and he preferred the club sandwich. It was a two-hour lunch. He would always have a glass of Pouilly Fuissé or two, and I drank, too, and that was what the couch was for.    His evening event would likely be outside the office, and you'd coordinate that.    At around 7:30, the signal you waited for was, ''Wheels are up,'' and he was back on the plane to Washington, and that was the magic moment of release from responsibility.    Wheels up, Scotch out and sun down.     What you recognize in New York, as you look north and south, is the alternating red and white of the avenues, taillights and headlights, these rivers of white and red, and a blue twilight, spread out like an American flag.    At twilight, I'd get out a drink of Scotch, get out my sketchbook and sketch the panorama outside, this lovely moody sweep, so detached.    Each day, you take the subway in, this slow apotheosis, dripping from grime with the rush hour, and there was this release as you climbed up these black terrazzo stairs and entered the lobby. But it hadn't been renovated yet, so it had a 1930's film of grime on it.     It was blessed with neglect, because sometimes the worst crimes of architecture are done under the justification of modernization. In the Chrysler Building, these are the same elevators, the same buttons, the same doors since 1930. The same tracery, the same laid wood that a nervous speak-easy patron would run his hand over.     And slow, so slow. It was like going up in a balloon ride.    We were on the 62nd floor. The round trip from the 62nd floor downstairs to coffee outside and back up would take 30 minutes.    When you arrived on the 62nd floor, there was an extreme letdown. Inside, it was government issue: more Dick Tracy than Jimmy Walker. Drywall walls.     In D.C. there's a chandelier, a window opening to the Capitol dome behind, velvet senatorial curtains, double swags, stars, a building designed for senators from the inside out.    The Chrysler Building was designed for the city. I was thrilled to be there. It was like having an office in the Acropolis. When we went to rent it, we asked, What's upstairs? The office manager said: ''It's the Cloud Club. It's closed, and nobody goes there.'' He eventually climbed up there and opened the door, where the stainless steel panels begin to arch.    It was a speak-easy, and the first thing you notice are these carved wood cupboards with pictograms on it, and each person would keep their stash of contraband spirits there and wouldn't want it identified by name, so they identified it with pictograms, stylized angular letters. A little door would open, you gave the password and you said you wanted a double Scotch fast.     The architecture and the panorama are meant to be married, and this is one of the most powerful rooms in New York. This should have been Giuliani's office.     The reason the Cloud Club wasn't being used then was that the access was too difficult; the fire stairs would have to be enlarged. I would counter it was never meant to be a public space. It was meant to be an elitist space, and the fewer people up there the better.    It had the feeling of an eagle's perch carved inside of a cliff, and it was dusty. There was the debris of chalky plaster on the floor. It was an abandoned place, and it didn't lessen its power. If anything, it heightened the romance.    CARL SPIELVOGEL  Chairman, Carl Spielvogel Enterprises, a global investment manager; former chairman, Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide, which rented Floors 12 to 24 from 1983 to 1995.      There was never a day when I walked into the building that I didn't have what I call a rush. There were people in the lobby looking at the ceiling, the history of flight. And it was a great feeling getting into an elevator, as opposed to going into something that looked like you were getting into a hospital elevator. They're patterned wood and metal. Now you get into an elevator, and there's a television commercial.    JIMMY BRESLIN  Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and onetime candidate for New York City Council president.      I come from Queens. We do better with low density out there, but I've been in it. It's nice.    With what's around now, straight-up-and-down glass boxes, the architecture is absolutely abominable in New York now. I love graceful buildings, and I loved the skyline before it was mangled and distorted.     But the Chrysler is not my favorite building.     The Flatiron Building, a hundred to nothing over the Chrysler. I like the shape of it. I like the grit downtown, street after street of five-story buildings with bars and stores and schools and fire engines and barber shops. That makes the city, the life.    THEODORE PRUDON  Architect at Prudon & Partners; helped restore the exterior of the Chrysler Building in the early 1980's.      The eagle gargoyles are an early example of stainless steel in America. Chrysler and the Empire State Building were two early examples to use it.    The finish was slightly dulled after 50 years, so we buffed it, and wherever necessary the seams got repaired. There was very little work on the spire; it was in good condition.    What got put in at the time was the lighting, the strip lights that outline the triangles in the windows. You can see thin fluorescents that follow the outlines of the windows, which give it the festive appearance. After the energy crisis of the 1970's, when all buildings were dark, this was a way of relighting buildings that was both energy-efficient and beautiful.    DOROTHY TWINING GLOBUS  Curator of exhibitions, Museum of Arts and Design.      This was 1969. My father had an office in the Chrysler Building. He was undercover with the C.I.A.

In fact, not for many a moon has such an amateurish specimen of animated photography been set upon the screen. Hence there are moments when the spectator may think that it might almost have been better to have just the voice issuing from the darkness of the theatre and leave the movements of the characters to one's imagination.Mr. Shaw may feel delighted with the screen vocal effects of this play, \\"How He Lied to Her Husband,\\" and he cannot find any fault with the dialogue, as no changes have been made in it. Apparently, he was not averse merely to photographing the action of the play, for he was behind the cameras a good deal of the time while this picture was being made. In fact, that may have been one of the reasons for the sad direction. Mr. Shaw's presence alone perhaps was enough to disconcert everybody, including the hardy lights men and electricians. Probably all had read something of the fabulous sums he had refused for the film rights to any of his plays, and here at last one of these bright works, even if a minor one, was being pictured.An Author Supervisor.Whether the director, Cecil Lewis, who is said to have been chosen by Shaw himself, offered any suggestions for changes or hinted at camera angles is not known, but one can readily imagine that the playwright might possibly have squelched any such ideas with a few stinging words. Then the producers, British International Pictures, had to be considered, for if Mr. Shaw, not the public, was pleased with the result of his first picture, knowing full well that \\"How He Lied to Her Husband\\" was not one of his outstanding works, other plays might be forthcoming from the author, who probably has reached a stage in life when gold is but dross. So one may presume that the order of the day around the Elstree studios was that nothing must be done to arouse the glint in the Shavian eye. There are only three performers in this picture, two men and a woman. They appear to be nervously happy—pleased at having the opportunity of performing before Mr. Shaw, but nervous when they think between lines of the chances that may come to them through pleasing the bard of Malvern and others they may miss through any faux pas.The inscrutable Shaw, who might have refused to see dozens of screen players, one day spent an hour or so of his valuable time calling upon Adolphe Menjou, a stenographic report of the conversation being forthcoming. Not so very long ago, before he left Adelphi Terrace, an editor of one of the great London dailies observed in an evening paper that Shaw had been offered an unheard-of sum for the film rights to one of his plays. The editor sent a reporter to interview Mr. Shaw and only a minute or so after the door was opened to the reporter a housekeeper came downstairs and announced that Mr. Shaw could not see him. The young man was insistent and the housekeeper, then more than slightly annoyed, told him that Mr. Shaw wouldn't see him and that was all that was to be said on the matter.The reporter very politely asked the indulgence of the housekeeper while he wrote a note on his card to G. B. S. The woman consented to take the card up to the playwright and, probably to her amazement, if not to the reporter's, Mr. Shaw hastened downstairs. The reason was that the reporter had tried a little of Shaw's own stuff on the author by writing on the card:\\"We have heard of the ridiculously low sum you have been offered for the picture rights to one of your plays.\\"Needless to say, Mr. Shaw wanted the world to know the truth.\\"How He Lied to Her Husband,\\" which is still at the George M. Cohan, is another Shaw joke, this time one on the British film producers. He wrote this playlet in 1905 and in the preface to it he explains as follows:\\"Like many other works of mine, this playlet is a pièce d'occasion. In 1905 it happened that Mr. Arnold Daly, who was then playing the part of Napoleon in 'The Man of Destiny' in New York, found that whilst the play was too long to take a secondary place in the evening's performance, it was too short to suffice by itself. I therefore took advantage of four days' continuous rain during a holiday in the north of Scotland to write 'How He Lied to Her Husband' for Mr. Daly. In his hands it served its turn very effectively.\\"Mr. Shaw then goes on to say that this playlet is printed as a sample of what can be done with even the most hackneyed stage framework by filling it with an unobserved touch of actual humanity instead of with doctrinaire romanticism.Queer Shadows.So one perceives the participants in this play—Robert Harris, Vera Lennox and Edmund Gwenn—in raiment of the Victorian days, with cinematic direction that seems of about the same period. Sometimes a head is partly cut off and often the players switch sides of the screen in the flash of an eye. The only noticeable motion picture touch is where the director gives a close-up of Aurora Bompas's (Miss Lennox) feet as she tiptoes over the carpeted floor. The whole action takes place in a parlor, with an occasional peep into the hall. For the most part the players do extraordinarily well, for they appear to take seriously the flip jests, but now and again it looks as though one of the trio had caught the steely Shavian eye, which is possibly worse than performing before ten thousand mere mortals or ordinary directors and managers, particularly while acting in scenes of the first motion picture of the author of \\"Fannie's First Play.\\"Poor though the pictorial side of this film is, it is to be hoped that Mr. Shaw, seeing that he was responsible for its sparkling humor as well as in a measure for its dull cinematics, will think it good enough to risk one of his full-length plays being picturized under experienced direction. He ought also to be informed of the latest improvements in sound recording and reproduction, including the new discovery by which surface sounds are eliminated. And in view of the fact that a picture is improved by movement, who knows but that Mr. Shaw might listen to reason and consent to rational changes in the filming of his plays, so long as such changes are not unnecessary or silly.\\"Illicit.\\"QUITE an intelligent and entertaining feature has been made from \\"Illicit,\\" a play by Edith Fitzgerald and Robert Riskin. Its situations are not especially novel, but the dialogue runs along smoothly and the acting is highly competent. It is not overwhelmingly subtle and the cheery or satisfactory ending is a trifle too sudden.Its argument is that, whether a young couple are living in companionate marriage or conventional marriage, they are only held together by love. Although superfically this is the case in this narrative, it seems as though the characters might have an excuse for parting forever had they not been bound by marriage ties.Curiously enough, this picture, now at the Winter Garden, opens with Richard Ives and Anne Vincent living together in the same apartment. Apparently nobody suspects that they are exponents of companionate marriage, and not until they put up at hotels together does society begin to observe this breach of social law. This causes one to think that most of the friends of the two lovers go about blindfolded. Then there are offered on the screen excerpts from a society paper which is evidently not concerned with the libel laws.From then on the chronicle becomes diverting in spite of its lack of suspense. Anne and Richard are married, although Anne is more enthusiastic about the companionate scheme of things. They are happy for a year, and then the inevitable bickering occurs. Then comes the conventional excuse of the husband and the wife's discovery that he is after all interested in that attractive blonde who was a weakness of his in years gone by. Anne has her old flame, who virtually tells her that he hopes her marriage will be a failure when he says that if she ever separates or is divorced from Richard he will be waiting for her.Barbara Stanwyck and James Rennie are thoroughly human in their rôles. The lighter vein is expressed by Charles Butterworth in his admirable, peculiar fashion. Claude Gillingwater is capital as Richard's father, who is responsible for making Anne consent to marriage.Raking Up the Past.A PICTURE along similar lines is \\"Once a Sinner,\\" in which the principals are Dorothy Mackaill and Joel McCrea. The title of this subject, which was at the Roxy, applies to the fact that a beautiful young woman enjoying the name of Diana has been enmeshed with a wealthy man before she becomes the wife of a young inventor named Thomas Mason. To do Diana justice, it should be mentioned that she tries to tell Thomas about her affair with Richard Kent, but he smothers her confession with kisses, refusing to hear his wife breathe a word against herself.So they marry and everything is bliss for a while—until Thomas and Diana come to New York from their home town of Sparta for the purpose of seeking capital for Thomas's invention. It happens that the man who can say yes or no to the financing is Kent, and as he is at the moment engaged to marry a nice young girl, he is rather in favor of helping Diana, who was his mistress. Thomas has an inkling of something wrong in Diana's past, but he does not connect Kent with his suspicions.Eventually Thomas and Diana separate and it looks as though Diana were going to sow more wild oats. Finally, however, the very man who was responsible for Diana's fall from grace prevails upon her husband to come from London to Paris and save her from becoming the mistress of a notorious gambler.It is an adroitly acted and well-directed production, but one that is never especially stirring. There is, however, a sense of verity about its scenes, which are compellingly pictured.A Would-Be Blood-Curdler.THAT old friend \\"The Bat,\\" which has served its time as a play and a silent picture, is now to be seen at the Rivoli in audible screen form. It is shown on a wide screen, and while every effort has been made to send chills down the spines of the spectators, it is never especially effective. A scream here or a mechanical surprise there are the extent of its bag of tricks. But the performers are uniformly good, notably Grayce Hampton, who impersonates the indomitable Mrs. Cornelia Van Gorder, who, it may be remembered, refuses to leave the house she has rented because of the activities of an individual who elects to pose as a monster bat.This new edition of \\"The Bat,\\" which was originally written by Mary Roberts Rinehart and the late Avery Hopwood, was directed by Roland West, whose last motion picture was that worthy contribution \\"Alibi.\\" Judging by the skill Mr. West has revealed in his previous productions, it seems strange that he should have chosen to make a picture of this old mystery yarn, which, while it undoubtedly has a certain popular appeal, is hardly deserving of the talent of Mr. West, who takes a long while between pictures.In the Foreign Legion.BEAU IDEAL,\\" a story from the pen of Percival C. Wren, author of that immensely successful \\"Beau Geste,\\" is at the Mayfair. It was directed by Herbert Brenon, who did so very well by the writer's first story. It would seem to the ordinary observer that Mr. Brenon has tried to make a film to please everybody and in doing so what success he has is dubious.This audible film begins with death, moaning and general hysteria of prisoners in a well-like prison in the Sahara. Then through the familiar words, \\"Stout fellow,\\" Lester Vail, an American Legionaire prisoner, realizes that the man who is almost dying of hunger and thirst is none other than John Geste, whom he joined the Foreign Legion to find.As in \\"Beau Geste,\\" there are flashbacks to the scene of the childhood of the principal participants, and these Mr. Brenon has done very well, far better than the other stages of this story. There is in these sterling sequences a dog which is particularly appealing, and it is this animal which is decorated for valor by the child John Geste, who then utters the words \\"Stout fellow.\\" These scenes with children bring to mind Mr. Brenon's beautiful silent picture of Barrie's \\"Peter Pan,\\" and thinking of that one also recollects this same director's remarkable success with Barrie's \\"A Kiss for Cinderella.\\" Hence Mr. Brenon's direction cannot be judged by this film or by that hardly praiseworthy audible version of \\"The Case of Sergeant Grischa.\\"In \\"Beau Ideal\\" one encounters the Emir's favorite dancer, known as the Angel of Death, and this young woman's activities in the yarn make it more than slightly absurd. In fact, Mr. Brenon's fine work in photographing cloud effects, sharp shadows and scenes on the undulating sands go for little in the panic of events toward the end of this chronicle.\\"Le Petit Café.\\"THE President Theatre is showing the French dialogue film, \\"Le Petit Café,\\" with Maurice Chevalier and his wife, Yvonne Vallee. The English edition of this picture was called \\"Playboy of Paris.\\" The French version is quite an entertaining film, but it does not keep any closer to the play than the English edition did. M. Chevalier, however, is in it and that means a great deal. His wife plays the café proprietor's daughter with whom Albert (M. Chevalier) falls in love.The opening performance, last Tuesday evening, was attended by an enthusiastic gathering which overflowed the little theatre. M. and Mme. Chevalier, Adolph Zukor, Emil Schauer, H. d'Abbadie d'Arrast and Primo Camera, the giant Italian pugilist, who is a friend of M. Chevalier, were among those at the show.After Albert the waiter had taken the girl in his arms and the picture vanished from the screen, the audience's interest was centred on Chevalier in the flesh, who, in his usual gracious manner, spoke a few words.Once outside the theatre Chevalier shook hands with all comers, looking very small beside the giant Carnera. One of those on the sidewalk remarked:\\"Here we are outside a motion picture theatre in the heart of New York and one might think we were on the Paris boulevards. Comme c'est drôle.\\"Since Mary Carr appeared in \\"Over the Hill\\" she has played thirty-one mother rôles, which represents also the number of films in which she has appeared. The latest is \\"Kept Husbands,\\" in which she will be seen with Dorothy Mackaill, Joel McCrea, Clara Kimball Young, Bryant Washburn, Florence Roberts and others.

So when a meal in a elaborately decorated restaurant, with a fancy menu, extensive wine list and elegantly attired servers, comes up short, it is a greater disappointment than it would be in a more simple establishment.\\n\\nCafe Royale, which opened in March in the upscale Tricorne Shopping Center near the A. & P. Future Store in Wall Township, is a case in point. The restaurant is reminiscent of the 1930's with old rose-colored carpet and banquettes, frosted glass panels etched with swans, an ornate fountain in the center of the dining room, fresh freesias on the pristinely napped tables and servers in black tie. There is also a piano bar where, until recently, Ray Noble's nephew Bud played incredible music. Joseph Cinderella is now the pianist. \\n\\nThe elaborate menu is not inexpensive","excerpt":"an average three-course meal without tax, tip or beverage is about $32. That made it all the more disappointing one night when neither the food nor the service lived up to the expectations raised on entering the unexpectedly elaborate restaurant. \\n\\nActually, our first visit was better than our second. The fact that the headwaiter was on vacation may well have contributed to the disorganized manner in which we were served the second time. The only consistent service then was from our busboy. In fact, we had to ask him several times to get our waiter so that we could either order or be served.\\n\\nEven though the execution of the food may not live up to the menu, one can have a decent meal here by choosing carefully. There are several dishes I would happily order again. For instance, coquille St. Jacques (scallops), perfectly prepared a la Parisienne with cream and mushrooms, was served in a shell-shaped pastry plate. Crepes Royale was two thin crepes, served warm, containing chunks of smoked salmon coated with egg cream sauce and a touch of caviar. The two slices of smooth ultra-rich duck pate topped with aspic and served with a sweet Cumberland sauce were also good, as was the simple lump crab meat cocktail with two sauces. \\n\\nBaked oysters topped with crab meat and cheese were unappealing, as was the half-moon pasta with ham and mushrooms, which suffered from an overkill of raw garlic. Shrimp and crab meat bisque was acceptable but not exciting, and a grilled quail would have been good if only it had a modicum of seasoning, because the mixed salad with black currant vinaigrette served with it was very good. \\n\\nMain courses were the big disappointment. Three lamb chops were accurately cooked and well prepared, as was the tortellini with a spicy sauce containing spinach and ham. \\n\\nDover sole, served on the bone as requested, was slightly overcooked when sauteed meuniere with butter and lemon as listed on the menu. But on another occasion, when we asked that it be broiled without sauce, it was overcooked to the point where it was hard and the edges were charred.\\n\\nDuck with orange was greasy and had a precooked flavor , and tournedos Henri IV, a classical preparation that's supposed to be served with an artichoke bottom and bearnaise sauce, tasted as though it were topped with a minuscule amount of a cheese-flavored sauce. A boneless chicken breast rolled around lobster and baked, then sliced and served with an herb sauce, was not to my taste, but was enjoyed by the person who ordered it. \\n\\nOne of the desserts, which on the whole were very good, was an apple strudel with rancid walnuts. When we told the waiter, his comment was, \\"You mean you don't like it?\\" That was obviously not the point; we were trying to let him know something was wrong, but his comment seemed to be indicative of a certain attitude. The price of the dessert was not removed from the check. \\n\\nBut desserts worth ordering are the lemon meringue cheesecake, a chocolate mousse cake with either orange or raspberry filling and the crepes suzette prepared at the table.\\n\\nThe wine list is small but comprehensive and very well priced. It ranged from $10 for either a Mateus or Lancers rose to $165 for a Chateau Lafite Rothschild Premier Cru Classic. But vintages were not marked, even on the higher-priced bottles.\\nCafe Royale \\n\\nSatisfactory \\n\\n2007 Route 35, Tricorne Shopping Center, Wall Township.

With translations by Clark Hansen.  225 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. Cloth, $14.95. Paper, $6.95.   IN each successive stage of history, Friedrich Engels wrote, ''the most powerful, economically dominant class ... acquires new means of holding down and exploiting the oppressed class.'' Religion has served this end, as has purblind patriotism. In our time there have emerged ''more highly developed instruments'' - also Engels's phrase - to cloud the public's mind with illusions and delusions. So runs Ariel Dorfman's thesis, and he has chosen three of these instruments for detailed scrutiny: Babar the Elephant, the Lone Ranger and Reader's Digest.   Mr. Dorfman proposes to demonstrate how our consciousness is shaped. He does so by examining a set of children's books, the adventures of a hero for preadolescents and the workings of the world's most widely read adult magazine. A further feature of ''The Empire's Old Clothes'' is that the author is a Chilean exile, offering us a picture of ourselves as seen by an outsider.

Aside from Mr. Borzage's deft direction and the bright dialogue contributed by Edwin Burke, there is the thoroughly human performance of James Dunn, a newcomer to the screen, who was last seen on the stage for a brief spell in \\"His Majesty's Car.\\"The only adverse criticism to be offered of this bit of life from New York's tenements is concerned with its strangely unsuitable title. However, that is of small importance, for many a poor picture has boasted a good title.This story runs easily throughout all its length, and Mr. Borzage has chosen the desired action to suit the words, never stressing any lines and sometimes only permitting them just to be heard and no more. A pat remark may be made just as a character is leaving the house, but it is not repeated. The dialogue is generously endowed with slang, but even those who object to colloquialisms could not resent the remarks made in this picture, because they come from the lips of the characters with such pleasing spontaneity.It is a year in the lives of two young people, beginning with their first meeting and ending soon after the arrival of their first-born. Eddie Collins, who works in a radio store, is a serious young man who saves his pennies, being ambitious one day to own his own business. He speaks his mind to Dorothy Haley in his first talk with her, but in spite of his facetious utterances he eventually falls in love with her. Edna Driggs, Dorothy's friend, invariably makes Eddie bristle, but she gives him as good as he sends. In fact, Edna has more real faith in Eddie than his wife has during some of the happenings in this story. Edna and Eddie can therefore be set down as friendly enemies.One of the fine sequences is where Eddie decides to rent and furnish an apartment for his young wife. He, to use his own expression, \\"shoots the works,\\" and then pretends that the apartment belongs to another young couple on whom he and his wife are calling. There are moments when Dorothy wonders how her husband knows all about the furnishings of the place and the cost of everything. As a matter of fact, while she enthuses over the home, she is at the moment chiefly concerned over the fact that she is going to have a baby. Hence, when Eddie informs her that it is her own home, she is not nearly as happy as he expected she would be.When Edna finally tells Eddie that Dorothy is about to become a mother, the young husband vouchsafes that everybody in New York seems to know about it \\"except the guy that's most interested.\\" He never swerves in his thoughtfulness toward Dorothy and when they discuss doctors he appreciates that his wife has little confidence in the physicians they can afford. There is Dr. Burgess, who at one point is described as a specialist who is called in when a king is born. How Eddie would like to have the services of this eminent man!\\"Where there's a will there's a way,\\" seems to be Eddie's motto. He saves money by stinting himself and even enters into minor pugilistic bouts to make ten dollars or so. He calls on Dr. Burgess and lays his cards on the table, outlining what he is doing, his prospects for dollars here and there and emphasizing the fact that he has $350. Will Dr. Burgess undertake the case? The famous man consents and Eddie says: \\"It's great to get a guy like you.\\" The young man is highly elated and after sparring around for some complimentary remarks, he says: \\"Gee, Doc, you've got a swell dump here.\\"After Dorothy's child is born, Eddie has further reason to think that Dr. Burgess is \\"a great guy,\\" for the physician not only gives the young father a receipted bill, but starts the baby's bank account with a check for $50.It is a jubilant mother and father who are later seen journeying from the hospital to their apartment in a taxicab. A bump in the road elicits from Eddie warning to the driver that he has as a passenger a possible President of the United States.All these and scores of other incidents are set forth in a refreshing fashion. Sally Eilers does splendidly as Dorothy. She, under Mr. Borzage's astute guidance, senses the vagaries of the character. Minna Gombell also serves this production well by her clever portrayal of Edna. But Mr. Dunn is the stellar performer and he has a decided individuality. There seems to be little or no effort in all that he does, and while there was many an eye glistening with tears and many a quivering lip among those in the audience yesterday afternoon, it was because of the straightforward fashion in which Mr. Dunn went through his part and not through any overstressing of the incidents.

But as the members of the group Crossings moved onto the stage, still sustaining their low pitches, overtones could be heard, hovering in a high treble range, changing pitch, sliding gradually upward in slow, repeated waves. This was a vocal technique I have heard used only by Tibetan monks who could produce two pitches at once by controlling the shapes of their mouths and throats.   The sense of solemn Eastern ritual continued as the eight players almost reverentially took their places behind arrays of instruments.

As he comes from the witches for a first meeting with his Lady, for instance, his line-readings immediately suggest that he and his spouse have already spent an evening or two around the castle discussing the possibility of Duncan's sudden demise. The notion isn't really new to either of them and this hint at an earlier conspiracy speeds the evening's opening stages along nicely, bypassing as it does that whole thorny argument about which of the co-conspirators is truly the more ambitious. They, in the language of a later day, are in this thing together.   And Mr. Williamson, further functioning as overall director of the piece, must be credited with a flair for swift and attractive pictorial compositions - at least when he is dealing with the supporting cast. A headlong sweep of knights eager to kneel at the feet of their king, an uneasy stir at a banquet table as the host of the occasion begins to behave oddly, the plausible physical mechanics of the killing of Banquo - all are neatly, briskly managed.

All of these average no more than two inches in length. Among the 50 vinaigrettes, of particular interest to many may be one made in 1838, decorated with a chased, three-dimensional view of Kenilworth Castle. It is $1,450. Others show Sir Walter Scott's home, Abbotsford, and the poet Byron's home, Newstead Abbey.

However, those who find much of Mr. Carter's recent work overly complex and aggressively dissonant may find Composers Recordings Incorporated's new disk devoted to his early music (CRI 475, ''Elliott Carter: The Early Music'') a pleasant surprise. This commendable album, featuring Paul Dunkel and the American Composer's Orchestra, includes three important formative compositions: Symphony No. 1 (1942), ''Holiday Overture'' (1944) and the popular ''Suite from Pocahontas'' (1939), and can serve as an easy introduction to Mr. Carter's work. The music herein is tonal, accessible, colorfully orchestrated, determinedly communicative.   Although Mr. Carter was a young man when he composed these works, he was hardly a novice. He had already studied with Gustav Holst and Nadia Boulanger and completed a myriad of student works - continually expanding his horizons and testing out new ideas. One finds a joyous grab bag of different voices here","excerpt":"an eclecticism so complete that it crystallizes a new, particularly American folksong Neo-Classicism.

In this 1978 play, the web is taut and the words are weighted with portent and humor. The playwright tells his story in nine pithy scenes, all he needs to capture the hermetic world of his three conspirators. The essence of this devious work is delineated with precision in John Tillinger's revival at the Long Wharf Theater. Having previously mastered the farcical art of Joe Orton, Mr. Tillinger proves to be equally secure with the understated intrigue of Mr. Pinter.   In \\"Betrayal,\\" time moves backward, a method of storytelling that deepens the narrative. Answers are followed by questions, apparent contradictions by clues to behavior. Characters are revealed through a warp of memory, as time tricks the unwary.

Ms. Weeks, who left her office after the announcement on Monday and did not return yesterday, did not respond to several telephone messages. But people within and outside the club said yesterday that her tenure had been characterized by rocky spells and by tensions with executives at the Book-of-the-Month Club, most notably Juanita James, who in April was promoted to a senior vice president of the club and its sister, the Quality Paperback Book Club, making her one of Ms. Weeks's bosses.

A day before the minister ordered the destruction of the structure, a Late Ptolemaic sarcophagus and a clay coffin with a skeleton visible inside were discovered in the area.

It is a French film, with French players, who, through the wizardry of cinema studios, speak English fluently, but their lips sometimes belie the language they are talking. It is, however, done well enough for the purpose.So far as the story is concerned, it is one of those antique thrillers which give the evil genius of the story enormous advantages over the minions of the law. Fantomas has, like most murderers in mysteries of this kind, an adventurous spirit. He likes to send messages to a group of persons warning them that if they do not separate before midnight one of their number will meet with an untimely end. This maniac sometimes appears in black tights and a mask, and, with the assistance of the director, he is extraordinarily successful in his killings. In the end the director deserts him and permits that famous detective, Juve, to have his innings, but not before Fantomas has broken several chairs on his pursuer's head.The players do very well by their rôles, but the language they are supposed to be talking does not always suit their movements or their facial expressions.

BEHIND THE RULING -- The defense had torn holes in the testimony of the boy at the center of the case, so the chance to show that the charged acts are part of a larger pattern of Mr. Jackson's behavior is a major boon to the prosecution's case. But it means greatly expanding a trial that is already a media circus, adding days or weeks of see-sawing between lurid new testimony and brutal attacks on witnesses' credibility.    DEATH SENTENCE -- In a closely divided ruling, the Colorado Supreme Court upholds a lower court's decision to throw out a death sentence given to Robert Harlan in a 1995 rape and murder case because jurors consulted a Bible during sentencing deliberations.    BEHIND THE RULING -- Courts strive to have juries stick strictly to what they see and hear during trial in reaching verdicts, with no influence or distraction from any outside source or authority, even a dictionary. The fact that it was a Bible that the jurors consulted in this case sweeps it up into the vortex of national debate over religion in public life.    TUESDAY    SEX DISCRIMINATION -- The Supreme Court rules that Title IX, the federal law barring sex discrimination in education, also bars school officials from retaliating against people who bring complaints under the law -- even those who were not themselves discriminated against, like Roderick Jackson, an Alabama high school basketball coach who complained that a girls' team was given short shrift.    BEHIND THE RULING -- Though Title IX lacks specific language about retaliation, the court says effective enforcement depends on people like teachers and coaches, who usually are better able to speak up about discrimination than students are.    TELECOMMUTING -- A New York state court rules that a computer programmer who did most of his work at his home in Nashville, Tenn., rather than at his employer's New York offices is still liable for New York state income tax on all his income.    BEHIND THE RULING -- Since their authority generally stops at the state line, the ease with which the Internet erases geographical distance gives state tax collectors fits. They have already lost billions in revenue to the rapid rise in online retailing and the opportunity it offers to sidestep sales tax. Applied broadly, the court's decision could put a damper on the growth in telecommuting by stripping it of a similar advantage.    WEDNESDAY    AGE DISCRIMINATION -- The Supreme Court rules that an employer can be sued and held liable for age discrimination even if it was unintentional. But simply showing a disadvantage to older workers is not enough to prevail, the court says","excerpt":"an employer's reasonable policy or action could still pass muster even if it happens to have disparate effects.    BEHIND THE RULING -- By making it easier to bring age discrimination suits but harder to win them, the court transforms the landscape for employers: The absence of bad motives for their actions won't shield them any more, but the presence of good reasons might. Still to be sorted out in future cases is what will qualify as ''reasonable.''

Pompidou said yes, but everyone involved stayed mum about the idea until last week so the Modern's small coup wouldn't detract from  Philadelphia's big show.         What the Modern has now are 14 works from Paris added to its own 10, which still don't add up to anything like a real Brancusi retrospective, and the museum isn't pretending this is one.

THE PLAY","excerpt":"An Entertaining Musical Show."},{"year":"1927","title":"\\"The Brute,\\" the present film offering at the Colony, is a Western story that is a good entertainment. It has its failings in its extravagances, but through the manner in which the narrative is acted and told one finds one's self wondering what's going to happen next. There are a number of incidents that would not bear the acid test of analysis, and more than once natural human instincts are sacrificed either for the sake of amusement or to gain sympathy.Monte Blue, who has acted competently under some of the best directors, including none other than Ernst Lubitsch, appears in this film as \\"Easy Going\\" Martin Sondes, a likable chap who, when enraged, is a tower of strength. He gets into trouble through a trap set for him by \\"Square Deal\\" Fenton, who by no means deserves his title, for his chief delight is in furnishing drinks to thirsty cowpunchers and then taking what money they may have left through anything but square games.Of course no girl would ever have stayed in the employ of Fenton. But Jennifer Duan, who is apparently more attractive than she is intelligent, dances her way through this story in Fenton's saloon and gambling place to pay off a debt. As is so often the case, Martin misunderstands the heroine's motives. He gets into dire disgrace through taking a glass of Fenton's doped liquor, and is forced to leave Texas.The question then is how to get the characters to meet again, and this is settled by having Fenton go to Oklahoma during an oil boom. So everybody goes to this place in Oklahoma, including \\"Oklahoma Red,\\" who at first appears to be the silliest man of the lot, but who eventually turns out to be a wizard when it comes to picking out oil wells. He is loyal, too, and Martin discovers, to his amazement, that he is owner of a fine, rich gusher.\\"Have a drink?\\" says \\"Oklahoma Red,\\" when he meets his old pal Martin.\\"I'll take a beer,\\" sighs Martin, who had just capped an obstreperous gusher.\\"Champagne is what you'll get,\\" declares \\"Oklahoma Red.\\"It can readily be imagined that when \\"Easy Going\\" Martin discovers that Fenton has been getting the best of him by lying about Jennifer there is a very rough time for the saloonkeeper.The oil-well scenes and those in which Martin performs his heroic stunt are interesting. Mr. Blue makes a genuine character out of Martin. Leila Hymans is attractive as Jennifer, and Clyde Cook, who does a good deal of drinking throughout the story, gives a sound idea of a whole-souled, medium-sized cowboy who, no matter what his weaknesses are, possess the virtue of sticking by his friends.In addition to this picture there is at the Colony a Vitaphone concert, the best feature of which is John Charles Thomas in his rendition of the prologue to \\"I Pagliacci.\\" The Vitaphone orchestra, playing \\"Orpheus,\\" is another praiseworthy number.

Not a bad sampling for one of this country's most important new-music festivals.   And if some musical styles were underrepresented -- the recent experimentation with vernacular forms, or samplings of new West Coast or Eastern European composition, for instance -- and if too many minor works were included, this was nevertheless an effective farewell for Oliver Knussen, the British composer who began directing the festival seven years ago.

Moss's new Broadway a rather entertaining screen murder mystery, wherein the killing off of five characters is more amusing than exciting. This production bears the title of \\"Murder at Midnight,\\" the narrative having been adapted from one by W. Scott Darling. In an early scene a butler named Lawrence, for some reason known only to himself, sets the clock ahead and it is therefore presumed that he at least had a hand in the shooting of a Mr. Kennedy. It happens, however, that Lawrence is one of those who meet death.As Police Inspector Taylor remarks in the course of the proceedings, \\"It is not a murder, but an epidemic.\\" Three of the characters are slain by means of a poisoned needle in a telephone receiver and the other two come to their end by bullets.This tale of wholesale slaughter begins with a surprise and also ends with one, for an individual at whom the finger of suspicion is not pointed turns out to be the murderer. His identity is best left untold.During the unfurling of this story there are the usual shadows of the guilty party, but no sooner has one concluded who the slayer is, than this person joins the list of victims. Robert Elliott, who is an expert when it comes to film sleuths, dawdles through the picture as the inspector, doing a great deal of thinking and just when one imagines that the wool has been pulled over his eyes, he turns up trumps and saves the State the cost of a trial and an execution. Inspector Taylor submits to so much ridicule from an elderly woman named Aunt Mildred, that one is led to believe that he would delight in discovering that she is an accessory before the fact. Aunt Mildred, however, lives to give the inspector a parting verbal shot in the final fade-out.At the outset two men and a woman are seen and one of the men, Mr. Kennedy, fires a shot at the other. This turns out to be a charade. Soon, however, it develops that a loaded cartridge has been inserted in the pistol supposed to contain only blanks and that the man playing the part of the lover is dead. Not long afterward Kennedy himself is shot.What with a lawyer having quarreled with Kennedy, one woman hiding blank cartridges in a pot of cold cream and another running around with a pistol, it is no easy matter for Taylor to solve the crimes.Aileen Pringle gives a creditable performance as Mrs. Kennedy. Clara Blandick affords no little fun by her impersonation of Aunt Mildred. Brandon Hurst is interesting as the nonchalant Lawrence. Hale Hamilton does splendidly as Montrose. Alice White is acceptable as a faithful maid.\\"Varieties\\" proved a popular form of entertainment in which those performers known as the Three Sailors won the most applause.

Each of those qualities can be found in the rapport between the 53-year-old saxophonist Joe Lovano and the 87-year-old pianist Hank Jones, both pictured above. The seeds for their current collaboration were planted four years ago at the behest of Mr. Jones, a distinguished veteran of the era in which jazz was a gilded branch of popular entertainment. The following year, having proved their chemistry on the bandstand, they conscripted George Mraz, the bassist in Mr. Jones's trio, and Paul Motian, a legendary drummer and longtime mentor to Mr. Lovano, for a Blue Note recording session. The result was ''I'm All for You,'' one of Mr. Lovano's simplest and strongest albums, released in 2004","excerpt":"an equally fine sequel, ''Joyous Encounter,'' appeared in 2005. Both are superb examples of a melodic and emotional frankness that used to be much more commonplace in jazz. Mr. Jones attests to that truth with a sparkling clarity and elegance, but Mr. Lovano testifies as well; he is one of the few musicians in his peer group to have come up the old-fashioned way, in touring big bands, and he has the ability to reach back to a premodern saxophone language with un-self-conscious ease. Performing next week as a duo, Mr. Jones and Mr. Lovano will model a responsive sort of interplay that would seem rarefied if not for its absolute lack of pretension.

He has a good chance of continuing the defense buildup that must form the backbone of any American foreign policy in the 1980's. After Mr. Brezhnev, the United States could easily pursue a policy of pressure on the Soviet Union's new leaders. Such a policy would force Mr. Andropov to dig in, if only out of self-preservation.

It is tempting simply to wait for the succession to unfold and for further Soviet economic deterioration. But the Soviet Union is not the ''basket case'' Administration officials perceive.

Escaping to Tokyo without a word of farewell or explanation, she finds work at a Chinese restaurant with a boisterous, largely American clientele. Thus transplanted, she tries her best to feel welcome in Japanese society, but the film clearly regards this as an impossible task. \\"Swimming With Tears\\" addresses itself bluntly to Japanese xenophobia by capturing the unhappiness and prejudice encountered by this gentle, accommodating foreign worker.   Fey, very much the innocent as played by Ruby Moreno, begins the story having already experienced second-class citizenship on the farm.  \\"My only function is hard labor and sex for reproduction,\\" she writes to her mother in the Philippines, though it was the mother who urged her to emigrate in the first place. (\\"Do you want to be an egg vendor like me?\\" Fey recalls her mother asking.) Part of the reason Fey has been sent to Japan is to find her father, a Japanese executive whom she has never met or heard from. Fey's mother, though ignored by this man, has never lost hope of attracting his attention.

May 3-9: Canada Plebiscite","excerpt":"An Eskimo Homeland Is a Step Closer"},{"year":"1925","title":"As an antidote to the sultry weather, \\"Kivalina of the Ice Lands,\\" the principal attraction at the Mark Strand this week, undoubtedly served a purpose yesterday, as for more than an hour one felt all the cooler for centring one's attention upon a frozen background with scenes of the \\"restless Arctic Ocean, silenced by the grip of the deadly Winter.\\" This film was produced by Earl Rossman, who has succeeded in making an informing and interesting effort. It, however, melts into mediocrity when compared with Robert J. Flaherty's masterpiece, \\"Nanook of the North,\\" which was presented at the Capitol three years ago.We are informed that in producing this new Eskimo picture Mr. Rossman endured the hardships of life in the Northern regions for approximately two years. An important result of Mr. Rossman's earnest efforts are two prismatic sequences of the majestic aurora borealis, which are impressive in spite of being all too short to give one a really comprehensive pictorial conception of this stirring phenomenon. There are the shooting lights and the giant rays of gold, green and red streaking up from what appears to be the other side of the world, looking like a blurred and constantly moving rainbow of vast proportions.The producer claims that this is the first colored motion picture taken of the northern lights. In these stretches there is an occasional fringing which causes one to wonder whether the colors are as true as they might be.Mr. Rossman has endeavored to increase the interest in this Arctic film by an Eskimo romance in which the hero accepts an appalling task from the Witch Doctor, one Nashulik. Aguvaluk, this gallant lover of Kivalina, is told that he must bring the wizened old Witch Doctor forty seals so that his father's spirit will rest in peace. The courageous Aguvaluk goes forth to bring back what is needed so that he may wed Kivalina, and through his adventures one has an insight into the colorless existence of the Eskimos. They are seen protecting themselves from a wicked wind by building a wall of great slabs of ice. The thousands of reindeer are driven into this Arctic camp and the unperturbed denizens of the North proceed to construct the comfortless igloos of blocks of snow and ice. The dogs are seen blinking as they squat, obviously eager for protection against the blizzard. Never have they known the comfort of a hearthrug before an open fire!One has a glimpse in another stretch of a so-called village \\"sprawled on the edge of a frozen ocean.\\" Yet these stoies of the North make the most of their lives, for Mr. Rossman shows what one might allude to as their Derby. Here one sees them in groups watching the reindeer, attached to sleds, racing.There are hard, glum Eskimo countenances, others that now and again light up with a flicker of a smile, and still others that appear quite contented. The grimness of the life stirs one, as for months these folks have no color on which to gaze. There are only the bleak, boundless wilds of snow and ice.Aguvaluk is seen busy spearing a seal. Actually there is not much of this business, as no sooner has Mr. Rossman depicted the hero killing one of these animals than follows a scene in which he has the quota of forty. He hastens back to the old parchment-faced Witch Doctor, who strikes one as an old villain. Aguvaluk is told that it is all very well to bring the forty seals, but how about the interest? His father's spirit cannot rest until that is paid. What is the interest? It is that Aguvaluk at the most difficult season of the year must bring a silver fox. Thereupon ensues the hero's adventures in finding and killing the silver fox.One of the most stirring chapters is where Aguvaluk is caught in a terrific blizzard, and to save himself he has to construct an igloo in great haste. One perceives here that by the time the camera man starts to turn his crank Aguvaluk has already prepared several blocks of snow and that his cutting them out with a small knife is but a perfunctory action. Mr. Rossman later shows Aguvaluk crawling out of the top of his igloo, which is completely covered by the deep snow.It strikes one that even a sticky day in New York is better than camping on the edge of a frozen ocean. There is a deal to be learned from this picture, and much credit is due Mr. Rossman for his courage and energy in putting forth such a production. That he had to follow a veritable masterpiece on the same subject does not diminish the sterling worth of parts of this effort.

Dr. Timothy E. Quill seems to have provided, by his own example, the most thorough answer to date.

The patient, a 45-year-old woman identified only as Diane, had acute leukemia and stood a 25 percent chance of survival if she opted for a grueling regimen of chemotherapy and other treatment.  Diane said she would rather die. When she later asked him for barbiturates to help her sleep, Dr. Quill said he knew she had decided to end her life. He prescribed the pills and told her how many would kill her. Authorities in Monroe County, N.Y., where Diane died, say they are investigating the incident. But a medical ethicist, Dr. Ronald E.

Stravinsky's \\"Symphonies of Wind Instruments\\" grew out of a posthumous tribute to the French composer. The Symphonic Fragments from \\"The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian\\" that followed it on Friday are a world away in style and mood, but this did not keep Debussy from supporting his Russian colleague at the most controversial moments of his career.   Written in 1920, the \\"Symphonies\\" seem out of place in the \\"Neo-classic\\" category that history has assigned to this segment of Stravinsky's career. They fit its negatives -- rejection of Romantic warmth, Romantic length and Romantic orchestration. But in the end they summon the Middle Ages more than they do the the age of Pergolesi. The strong, bright colors and uneven fragments of phrase are stained glass for the ear. The unpredictable meters remember a period when time was less affected by ticking clocks and music had not yet embraced their sense of regularity.

Graciela, who is one of Latin music's better-known singers, was paid tribute by everyone from Mayor David N.

Graciela has been a fixture on the New York Latin music scene since her arrival here in 1943 from Cuba, and people were there to see and hear someone who has helped define Latin musical expression since then.    The show started with Afro-Cuban traditional music, with drummers singing and chanting religious call-and-response tunes. They were joined by more percussionists and a handful of dancers and singers dressed as if they had stopped in for a moment on their way to a carnival. Las Hermanas Marquez, two sisters, came out and sang a few funny songs in Spanish, only to be replaced by Dizzy Gillespie (who received several standing ovations), Mayor Dinkins, and various tributaries all acknowledging Graciela, who, typically, was funny and self-deprecatory in her comments.

Mr. Bielinsky, who died of a heart attack in June at the age of 47, had only recently established himself as one of the most promising Latin American directors with ''Nine Queens,'' a twisty caper film that was a high point of the 2001 New Directors/New Films series. As thick with diabolical feints and ploys as any David Mamet play, this story of financial hanky panky created enough of a splash that it was remade two years ago as an unsuccessful American film, ''Criminal,'' starring John C. Reilly and Diego Luna.    At the time of his death Mr. Bielinsky had completed ''El Aura,'' a bleak, moody portrait of a shy taxidermist (Ricardo Darin) who has an obsession with imagining perfect crimes and a photographic memory compromised by sudden epileptic seizures. Much of the film takes place in the Patagonian forest, where the taxidermist, leery of killing animals, goes hunting for the first time and accidentally shoots the owner of the lodge where he is staying.

BOOKS OF THE TIMES","excerpt":"An Ex-Conservative Indicts the Right"},{"year":"1966","title":"THE STARK truth that the savagery of our times knows no boundaries is illustrated with sharply contrasting but not entirely conclusive effects by Italy's \\"La Commare Secca\\" (\\"The Grim Reaper\\") and the Argentine \\"The Eavesdropper,\\" which were unveiled at the New York Film Festival last night.The third entry of the director, Leopoldo Torre Nilsson, in the annual Lincoln Center fetes, \\"The Eavesdropper\\" is an explicit political statement as well as a poetically sensitive exploration of those nuances of love and caste that have distinguished his earlier films.The usual collaboration between the director and his wife, Beatriz Guido, and several others, has produced a script that stresses the compulsive spying that leads a young, well-to-do, obviously Fascist Buenos Aires terrorist to disaster in love and in politics.As always, the director's approach is elliptical, brooding and introspective and demands a good deal of a viewer despite the English subtitles. The basic story of the antihero, who is hiding out from the police in a garishly rococo hotel occupied largely by Republican Spanish refugees, is full of people whose motivations are not clearly defined. These include the nubile girl he invites to share his sanctuary, a lass who appears to be searching for the surcease of romance.One wonders why the heroine, played in gentle, moody and pensive fashion by Janet Margolin (the Lisa of \\"David and Lisa\\") would continue to be drawn to the callow terrorist, portrayed in glum, sometimes petulant style by Stathis Giallelis, remembered for his lead role in \\"America, America.\\" It is not easy to understand why he doesn't simply enjoy the pleasures of sex, which are torridly but decently displayed, instead of constantly succumbing to the snooping that proves disastrous to innocent people, to his cause and to his love.The director and the producer, Paul M. Heller (\\"David and Lisa\\"), have employed some refreshingly exotic types—especially Elena Cortesina as an aging soubrette—for the roles of the Spanish acting troupe in the hotel.Here and in other strange but pictorial settings the director has guided a somber, often fascinating drama in which his politics are perfectly clear even if his motivations are not. Royal Films International will release \\"The Eavesdropper\\" to theaters.\\"La Commare Secca,\\" screened earlier in the evening, is the work of Bernardo Bertolucci, the writer-director, who made it in 1962 when he was 20, preceding \\"Before the Revolution,\\" his drama that was shown at the film festival two years ago. \\"La Commare Secca\\" is vivid proof of his ability to generate genuine tension in a classic whodunit format while making little effort to flesh out his characters.The story is simplicity itself, even though his approach is oblique. The discovery of a dead prostitute on the weedy banks of the Tiber brings in a covey of suspects who once again illustrate that Roman society has more than its fair share of dregs. Included are an inept young thief who preys on unsuspecting neckers","excerpt":"an ex-convict and kept man; a rustic soldier; a couple of teen-agers; a homosexual, and a rough drifter who was one of theprostitute's clients.Mr. Bertolucci's dissections reveal the lying and viciousness common to these beasts in the human jungle. If these are only flashing forays, they do serve to make his points quickly and directly. He collaborated on the script with Sergio Citti and Pier Paolo Pasolini.The cast of nonprofessionals turns in natural portrayals that are too brief and obvious to be memorable. They do, however, keep the skein of the melodrama taut enough to hold any fan of this genre entranced.

But \\"Snowbound\\" and \\"One Night With You,\\" the English-made importations, which took up residence there on Saturday, are no pressing reasons for a hurried trip uptown. For the management has provided an ill-matched pair, whose resemblance is limited to some members of the respective casts and to the Italian locales.Otherwise \\"Snowbound\\" is a pleasant, suspenseful melodrama in which the superb Alpine exteriors and the mature dialogue and performances are blended neatly, while \\"One Night With You\\" adds up to a limp, tedious and transparent farce hardly worth all the strenuous histrionics and singing.\\"One Night With You,\\" the decidedly minor half of the twin bill, is a musical romance about an opera star engaged for the lead in an Italian movie, who is stranded in a village with a wealthy English girl. The couple, it seems, miss their train, money, baggage and identification but not the love light which finally appears. The picture simply misses.Patricia Roc makes a pretty and engaging heroine pursued by an explosive Italian, played explosively by Bonar Colleano. Nino Martini, as the tenor-star, excellently renders a few airs, operatic and otherwise. But Mr. Martini's acting is less than heady. \\"One Night With You,\\" in short, is a long, dull time.\\"Snowbound,\\" on the other hand, combines mystery, intrigue and a beautiful setting to narrate the story of a search for Nazi loot hidden in a skiing hut high in the Italian Alps. The conglomerate crew, snowbound in that refuge, includes a film director and one of his extras, who were British intelligence officers in the war","excerpt":"an ex-Gestapo officer; a renegade British officer and a spurious Italian countess and her obsequious right-hand man. This disparate group never succeeds in its quest for the millions in gold bullion but the goings-on prior to the overly melodramatic climax are lively and intriguing.Herbert Lom stands out as the suave, soft-spoken Gestapo officer, who makes no bones about his terrible conviction that a fourth Reich is inevitable. Robert Newton turns in a small, precise bit as the film director and quondam intelligence man. Also contributing solid portrayals are Mila Parely, a newcomer, who plays the countess; Dennis Price, as Newton's associate; Marcel Dalio, as the lady's partner in crime, and Guy Middleton and Stanley Holloway, as the outlaw Britisher and a movie camera man, respectively. It might be noted, too, that a few, excellent skiing turns enhance the film's over-all pictorial beauty.

In this story of the attempted escape from Russia of a band of aristocrats in 1917 the featured players are Miriam Hopkins, George Bancroft and Alan Mowbray.It is an imaginatively pictured work with several maps in the introductory scenes showing the area controlled by the Bolsheviki at the time. These wonderfully interesting glimpses are followed by others of members of the Russian nobility herded in a box car of a train, most of them being garbed as peasants. Although there is precious little subtlety about this film, it at least conveys a suggestion of what happened, and there is a good impression of the anxiety of the travelers to get away from danger.Seated on the floor of the uncomfortable box car are a Russian duke, his paramour, a dancer, who has risen from being a peasant girl to performing in the salons of the wealthy","excerpt":"an ex-officer who has lost an arm and an eye; a woman with a baby, and various others.There is a short halt on the journey and a Bolshevik boards the car. He at first believes that the occupants are peasants, but finally awakens to the fact that they are fleeing aristocrats. Without much ado the duke and another man throw the intruder off the train and soon afterward, by bribing the loco-motive driver, the passengers find themselves in what they believe to be the safe harbor of Theodosia. From there they intend to board a ship for France.John Cromwell, the director, reveals some splendid scenes of the aristocrats, now arrayed in gala attire, enjoying what they believe to be their last night on their native soil. Suddenly the place is invaded by uncouth specimens of humanity, and soon it is learned that Kylenko, a sea captain, and his men have taken possession of the town.When Kylenko, played by Mr. Bancroft, espies a couple of knives sticking in a picture of the late Czar he bursts into prolonged loud guffaws. His attention is soon attracted by the charming Maria Yaskaya, the dancer, played by Miss Hopkins. Soon he puts on the duke's patent-leather top boots and swaggers about in them, not forgetting to tell Maria that he had frequently sat with the gallery gods to see her perform and to remind her of her humble origin.It is an exciting moment when the steamship arrives, for aboard it is a contingent of Cossacks, who soon have Kylendo and his unshorn crew under control. All looks well when the band of aristocrats leave aboard the vessel, but they are doomed to be disappointed, for Kylenko and his band eventually cow the crew and the vessel is turned back to Theodosia.There is an idea on the part of one of the trusted ship's officers to tamper with the compass, but the peasant who keeps vigil discovers that something is wrong through looking at the stars.This story winds up with Kylenko and his men saving Maria from being shot by a Bolshevist firing squad. It is gathered that Maria has fallen in love with the giant Kylenko, but why it is not quite clear. At any rate, she is only too glad to throw in her lot with him. It is presumed that the little band of aristocrats are killed.Mr. Mowbray gives an excellent performance as the duke. His lines are better written than those for the rôles played by Mr. Bancroft or Miss Hopkins. Mr. Bancroft is quite good, but more often than not he is extravagant in his mirth and he speaks his lines too carefully for the rôle of a rugged Russian seafarer. George E. Stone makes the most of a minor part.On the stage is most of the Kaufman-Dietz show, \\"The Band Wagon,\\" with Fred Astaire, Frank Morgan and Helen Broderick. It is a highly satisfactory entertainment, with plenty of laughs and pleasing melodies.

Ms. Mutter's performance of the Brahms Concerto with Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic on Thursday evening was utterly fascinating, putting indomitable virtuosity to the most compelling rhetorical use this side of Gidon Kremer. Tonal beauty abounded, often in spite of the abandon with which Ms. Mutter lit into passages.

Many of the sorts of artifacts and images that were stripped away from that show are now on the walls of American University, in Washington.     The Smithsonian's plans for a major exhibit on the Enola Gay were radically altered last January by the institution's president, after months of criticism. Veterans groups and members of Congress complained that the exhibition's text portrayed Americans as aggressors and Japanese as victims in the bombing. Eventually, nearly all references to the bombing's effects on Japan were erased. Historians were flabbergasted.    Although Washington University officials said their show was not an answer to the Smithsonian's show, the university's exhibit included artifacts like those planned for the Smithsonian. There were various items on loan from Japanese museums -- a melted clock and lunchbox, disintegrated clothes and kitchen goods -- and graphic pictures of the bombing's victims.     Speaking at the new exhibit's opening ceremony, a bomb survivor described seeing a friend's face \\"peeled, hanging like pieces of rag.\\" Another survivor said the dead bodies around Hiroshima \\"looked like charred fish.\\"    Scholars on both sides of this debate have wondered if 50 years was long enough to heal the bombing's emotional scars.

This benefit concert took shape as Ms. Nicholson fielded post-Katrina inquiries about the whereabouts of Edward (Kidd) Jordan, a saxophonist, educator and patriarch of the New Orleans jazz scene who has also been a Vision Festival favorite. (Mr. Jordan had evacuated his house near the 17th Street Canal the night before the levee breach.)

Just such a drama unfolds in a small, stunning show of the artist's paintings on paper at C&M Arts, a gallery that occupies the generous foyer and dining room of the Upper East Side town house belonging to Robert Mnuchin, an art collector turned art dealer.    The 15 works on view were made by Pollock in 1948 and 1949, when he was creating, on canvas, some of his greatest and most influential drip paintings. The selections at C&M Arts are also drip paintings, and also great, but they are relatively small, executed for the most part on paper measuring no more than 22 by 30 inches. At first they seem a little overwrought and precious, even miniaturized, like the Pollock equivalent of Faberge eggs, although this analogy may be encouraged by their luxe surroundings.

De Mille's influence is apparent to a marked degree in \\"Hell's Highroad,\\" the present offering at the Colony and incidentally the first production to be issued from the new De Mille studios. This picture was directed by Rupert Julian, who was responsible for \\"Merry Go Round,\\" and yet it is typical of Mr. De Mille's work, although it was only supervised by him while he was busy with the screen version of \\"The Road to Yesterday.\\" It is what might be termed an eye-full, as there are gorgeous female costumes, the action for which Mr. DeMille is famous, the spacious rooms with elaborate furnishings and a glimpse of a Broadway revue.As a story it is not absorbing, as Mr. De Mille usually takes advantage of his characters. But there is plenty of violent entertainment and a more or less plausible love story. It is a costly effort, a fact which can be readily gauged from the settings, the dresses, the incidental figurantes and the novel inclusions. You have in this film a party given by Ann Broderick, a billionairess, who strains every effort to amuse and entertain her guests. She has various ideas, one of which is a circus sideshow, in which there is an amusing and original feature. It is where some of the guests are shown looking at themselves in one of those mirrors which distort the figure and make one look dumpy and fat. The audience yesterday afternoon got no end of pleasure out of this scene, and it was a pity that there was not more of it. It is interesting for once to behold a handsome leading man gazing upon himself as a sort of ogre, and also to see the villain looking in the glass at his absurd figure.Billionairess Broderick is not the only wealthy character in this picture, as there is also the conniving and hopeful Sanford Gillespie, a man who owns a mint and a string of banks. Even the abbreviated name of one of the characters is reminiscent of Mr. De Mille. This weak hero is Ronald McKane, but as the story is unfurled he is alluded to as Ron. He is at first poor, then becomes wealthy, and finally is taught a severe lesson for neglecting his wife. She goes to Gillespie and asks that financial power to bring her husband to his senses by causing Ron to lose his money.Old Gillespie is fond of pretty women, and his large eyes often gaze in a leaded way at Ron's wife, Judy. When Ron gets into an automobile, knowing that his wife is probably at the wondow, Gillespie is seen looking at the woman like an old flirt. Yet Ron is not supposed to be aware of this.It seems almost natural that Ron should be angry when he discovered that Judy was responsible for his financial debacle, but one does not expect to see him try to throttle her. The quick De Mille touch comes when Ron, about to kill his wife, observes that she is quite attractive and therefore he stays his hands and kisses her!There are parts of this picture which make one think that the censors were in a lenient mood when they viewed it. Such sequences do not add to the worth of this production. Love is treated in a harsh way. When Ron becomes infatuated with the Billionairess Broderick there are scenes depicting him with Mrs. Broderick and afterward others showing Judy and Gillespie. So one imagines that they are at separate tables, but subsequently one learns that the four people are together.Leatrice Joy, who gave such a splendid performance in \\"The Dressmaker from Paris,\\" impersonates Judy. She again displays her screen talent. Edmund Lowe as Lon is acceptable in some stretches and very good in others. He is for the most part too artificial in his facitl expressions, which appear to be governed by the camera man. Robert Edeson is satisfactory as Gillespie.Less violence and a more delicate love story would have enhanced the worth of this picture.\\"The Fall of Eve\\" Opens Monday.\\"The Fall of Eve,\\" a play by John Emerson and Anita Loos, will be presented at the Booth Theatre next Monday night with Ruth Gordon in the leading roôle.

Dreary, unimaginative houses, scattered across the landscape with little concern for much of anything except carving up the earth in a way to give every one of those disjointed structures its little sliver of backyard, its closed-off, private piece of nature. The prevailing notion seems not so much community as separation - as a village whose physical layout seems to symbolize keeping apart, not joining together.   This conventional image is not without its truth - it surely fits Levittown and most of that development's post-World War II brethren, for example. Though the postwar suburban tract house had certain virtues as a building in itself, the ways in which it tended to be spread across the land made most tract developments disasters from a planning standpoint.   But it was not always so: There is a long and honorable, if too little known, tradition of thoughtful and conscientious suburban planning in the United States - a legacy of places neither boring nor indifferent to the landscape.

Simply to present a story about a band of ruthless crooks who murder a man carrying a large sum of money would not be very stimulating, but when the victim is a messenger for a communal farm enterprise that is jeopardized as a consequence, the drama quickly acquires emotional force.Cut from much the same harsh, realistic pattern that distinguished \\"Open City\\" and \\"Shoe-Shine\\" and stimulated great interest in Italian films, \\"Tragic Hunt\\" is a hard-hitting exposition of violence and smoldering passion, of despair and determination to sustain life amidst the devastation left in the wake of war. While this picture, directed and co-authored by Giuseppe de Santis, is not as trenchant and tidy a work of craftsmanship as those earlier films, there is an elemental vigor and bite about \\"Tragic Hunt\\" that give it considerable power. For the Italians have the gumption to portray themselves and their circumstances, however unflattering the effect imparted, with an objectivity that can be cruelly candid.As the title indicates \\"Tragic Hunt\\" is a chase type film","excerpt":"an hour and a half's worth of determined pursuit as a whole countryside is aroused by telephone and the pealing of church bells to cut off the escaping killers who grow more desperate and depraved as their chances run out. The leader of the gang is a vicious female, a former collaborator with the Nazis.The bandits stage their ambush of the truck carrying the money from an ambulance and take as hostage the bride of a young farmer when he recognizes one of the outlaws as a former fellow prisoner of the Germans. There is a great deal of poignancy engendered by the almost complete in difference about the fate of the bride among all save her husband..Daniela, the cold, calculating gang leader, is truly a monstrous dame. She is a remarkably curious combination of brute instinct and feminine wile, who is unflinching in the face of danger, yet alternately submissive, craven and domineering in her love for Alberto, a partisan who turned to plundering his fellow man when he could not obtain gainful employment. Daniela is vividly played with keen appreciation for her complexities by Vivo Gioi. Signorina Gioi skillfully underlines the savage nature of Daniela from the first glimpse of her taunting the kidnapped bride until, in a hysterical outburst, she ruthlessly tosses a seriously wounded farmer out of the ambulance.As Andrea Checchi effectively portrays Alberto he is not beyond sympathy, for he creates a character of inherent decency whose sense of values has been warped by frustration, hardship and an inexplicable fascination for Daniela. The peasant types, from tired looking adults to wan children in ragged clothing, have such an appearance of reality that one has the feeling that they must be genuine. \\"Tragic Hunt,\\" a lusty melodrama with tragic overtones that are more implied than developed, is by far the best Italian film to reach here since Rossellini's \\"Paisan\\" arrived early in the year.

C. Fielda, the veteran stage comedian, has struck his stride as a screen actor in the picturization of J. P. McEvoy's play, \\"The Potters.\\" Yesterday afternoon this film aroused many a round of hearty laughter from the large audience in the Paramount Theatre.The rôle of \\"Pa\\" Potter fits Mr. Fields like the proverbial glove. His performance is a real achievement, for he has resisted the temptation to be extravagent or to duplicate his mirthful actions. The moods of \\"Pa\\" Potter are reflected admirably by Mr. Fields, and whether it is a lowering of an eyelid, a gesture of his right hand, a frown or look of exuberance, one feels delighted with this Mr. Potter. The tale contains a nice quota of suspense, and the adapters, Sam Mintz and Ray Harris, have been far more restrained in translating this stage effort into a scenario than is usually the case.Fred Newmeyer, who directed several of the most successful of Harold Lloyd's comedies, is to be congratulated on his sound work in producing this picture. He has kept the story on an even keel and has permited the romance between Mamie Potter and \\"Red\\" Miller to stay within its proper limits. And although \\"Pa\\" Potter is the centre of attraction, he never appears to be trying to steal anybody else's thunder.The first scene in this production is in itself distinctive and it starts the story bowling merrily along. It is that of a coffee pot boiling over. And then there is \\"Ma\\" Potter, impersonated by Mary Alden, busy getting the family breakfast ready. Upstairs Bill Potter is giving the finishing touches to his hair and mustache, and \\"Pa\\" is having a frightful time trying to get near enough to a mirror to shave himself.The narrative races along without the least hesitation, and while one may regret that Potter is gullible enough to invest $4,000 in the then worthless oil stock, one is afterward highly gratified when the impressionable gentleman discovers that, after making what he thinks is a good bargain, he still is the owner of a share of stock that had completely slipped his mind.There are moments when \\"Pa\\" Potter is just the stenographer, and then there are his dreams of wealth. It is difficult for him as he figures out on paper that the stock will give him at least an income of $20,000 a day, to control his flexible physiognomy. Then he has his boastful periods, his gloomy instants, and others of unconfined joy.The adamant \\"Ma\\" Potter ships her husband back to the oil centre to force the return of the money for the stock \\"Pa\\" bought with enthusiasm. It happens, and quite reasonably, that \\"Pa\\" gets into a coach which has been uncoupled from the train. \\"Pa,\\" who believes in making himself comfortable, goes to sleep and finds himself in the same place when he awakens.Miss Alden's portrayal of \\"Ma\\" Potter is another proof of her versatile talent. Ivy Harris is attractive and capable as the daughter. Richard \\"Skeets\\" Gallagher, rather overdoes the sartorial effects of \\"Red\\" Miller, but otherwise he is acceptable.The chief number on the surrounding program is \\"Opera versus Jazz.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"An Hour of Real Fun."},{"year":"1963","title":"J Grenfell show Television","excerpt":"An Hour of Vignettes by Joyce Grenfell"},{"year":"1965","title":"QUITE possibly, for many television viewers Thursday night, the most exciting program was the hour on Channel 13 devoted to the piano preludes of Claude Debussy.

Just ask Barbara and David Blumenthal, who at one point this year accumulated a pile of unpaid claims for doctor visits, lab tests, outpatient procedures and regular checkups for themselves and their three children.   With their medical coverage split between two insurers, Phoenix Home Life and Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the Blumenthals were not sure which bills were covered and whether they were being paid fairly for claims.   \\"I had lost track of what was outstanding,\\" Mrs. Blumenthal said. \\"All I knew was that I was missing a lot of money.   Like many two-career couples, the Blumenthals are pressed for time. Both run importing businesses and juggle responsibilities at their home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.   Overwhelmed by the paperwork, Mrs. Blumenthal acted on a friend's recommendation and hired a medical claims agent. Such agents are accustomed to dealing with insurance companies and can handle all the filings and follow-up calls. They also know how and when to challenge insurers over a rejected claim or a paltry reimbursement, say, $15 for a $100 office visit.   Since hiring their insurance go-between, the Blumenthals have received $3,000 in previously unpaid claims and paid the agent $575 in fees, including a $120 annual retainer.   Other families, the chronically ill, the elderly and even some companies are turning to medical claims agents to sort through the maze of insurance red tape. These agents can handle the paperwork arising from a catastrophic illness, address a backlog of claims or be a consultant on retainer.   People in the fledgling industry operate under several names: medical billing agents, public health adjusters and medical insurance consultants. The businesses are so new that there is no classification for them in the Yellow Pages. And they are not licensed or regulated in most states, including New York, which means consumers should check references carefully before selecting an agent.   Even their trade organization, the National Association of Claims Assistance Professionals of Downers Grove, Ill., is only two years old. \\"People still don't know we exist,\\" said Norma Border, the association's national director. The association, which has 800 members, puts the number of adjusters nationwide at 3,000 to 6,000, and expects business to continue growing even if the Clinton Administration overhauls the nation's health-care system.   Gila Bash Katz, who is the Blumenthals' agent, has enlisted 46 regular clients and one small company, which pays her to handle its employees' claims, since founding Quick Claims Inc. of Eastchester, N.Y., two years ago.   After initial contact, the adjuster will likely agree to make a house call, at no charge, to discuss your claims situation. If you decide to proceed, you will need to sign a limited power of attorney giving the professional the authority to deal directly with the insurance company. The claims adjuster will also need copies of all medical insurance contracts.   The agent's fees may be structured in several ways: a percentage, usually 10 to 15 percent, of the reimbursed amount","excerpt":"an hourly charge of $25 to $55; a specified amount for each claim, or an annual fee.   Rarely do adjusters set a minimum fee, although clients say it is seldom worth signing up until you have amassed at least $2,000 in contested or delayed claims. Threatening letters from hospitals and doctors who have not been paid often send consumers to a medical adjuster.   For the Blumenthals, the medical claims agent has taken on the status of the family lawyer or accountant, handling all medical insurance paperwork and providing advice on related matters. The family permits Ms. Katz to cash its insurance checks, deduct her 15 percent fee and consolidate the smaller reimbursements into a single check. But others may prefer to pay the agent separately.   The elderly, many of whom are covered by Medicare and a supplementary private policy, may look for a claims adjuster familiar with the vagaries of overlapping policies. The Berryhill Medical Claims Service of Danbury, Conn., says about 80 percent of its clients are covered by Medicare and a Medigap policy.    Ursula Milde, director of an elderly outreach program for New Rochelle Hospital in Westchester County, regularly sends people to adjusters. \\"I see people who don't know what to send where anymore,\\" she said. \\"You need itemized bills. You may need to make copies. You must know what's in your policy if they try to reject your claim.\\"    Insurance companies are only beginning to become familiar with medical claims adjusters, and insist it is too soon to gauge their effectiveness. But reimbursement is not necessarily quicker, cautioned John Gras, a spokesman for the Prudential-AARP Group Health Insurance.   Still, finding an intermediary to handle insurance headaches has its appeal. Even the Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh has hired a medical adjuster, Claim Guard Plus of Indianapolis, to assist its trust clients. \\"The volume of paperwork and the number of clients got too high,\\" said Marylee Steinmetz, supervisor of the trust insurance unit.

But her initial effort behind the camera is bold, if complicated, in presenting facets of amour, illicit and otherwise, at too great length. The points her couples illustrate seem varied, but become obvious long before the film's conclusion.In proof of her genuine versatility, Miss Zetterling not only directed but also wrote the script in collaboration with her husband, David Hughes, the British novelist.While the screenplay stems from a noted Swedish novel, it is slightly reminiscent (to a diligent filmgoer) of \\"Brink of Life,\\" Ingmar Bergman's contemporary drama, seen here in 1959, in that it binds together the dramas of several pregnant women. Miss Zetterling's basic thesis, however, is a reflection of moral decay in the middle and upper classes of Sweden in 1915.Her interest, and that of her principals, in the physiology of childbirth is nominal. Her major concern, revealed in a series of convoluted, sometimes overlapping flashbacks, are the backgrounds of the gestations.There is the aristocratic, 18-year-old Angela happily awaiting the child of a married man who once was her aunt's lover. There is Adele, the bitter servant in the household, who hates both her lowly position and her husband. And there is Harriet Andersson, a fun-loving servant and artist's model, who willingly marries a faintly homosexual painter to hide the fact that the father is a young scion of a wealthy family.That family, as well as the obstetrician and other members of Swedish upper-crust society, are as sardonic about sex as is the film's title. And Miss Zetterling's narrative, which is smooth, is also direct. It includes a fragmentary but explicit liaison between the artist and the statuesque, disillusioned matron of the manor, played in regal but cynical style by Eva Dahlbeck","excerpt":"an illustration of lesbianism in a girl's school and several romantic sequences that do not need the English subtitles.In focusing on extramarital unorthodoxy among the castes, Miss Zetterling has elicited a variety of solid portrayals that redound to the credit of the Swedish acting varsity she has employed. Included among them are the performances of Gunnel Lindbolm, as the love-hungry, frustrated servant who detests the child she has conceived; Gio Petre, as the beautiful Angela, who wants her illegitimate offspring despite the knowledge that she can never again be with the father she loves; Anita Bjork, as her aunt, who is satisfied to \\"share\\" that child with her niece; Gunnar Bjornstrand, as the cynical obstetrician; Miss Andersson, who was seduced in childhood, but who has come to savor sex, and Jan Malmsjo, the artist, who accepts a fee for marrying her as cheerfully as he makes quips.The photography, especially in sylvan surroundings, is a decided attribute, even if the film's mood is somber. Miss Zetterling has stacked her pathos; fears and drama largely in favor of the ladies. And, she obviously has succeeded in shocking us now and again in a convoluted saga that doesn't need all those full explanations. But she has come up with an arresting, serious drama that proves she knows the directorial craft and is a welcome addition to it.

Besides weather that encouraged all but the most devoted to stay home, there was competition earlier in the day from Marilyn Horne, who celebrated her 60th birthday at Carnegie Hall with an all-star benefit for her new foundation. And Miss Pollet's uneven performance as Cassandra in the Metropolitan Opera's production of \\"Les Troyens\\" may have eroded her potential audience somewhat.

Stage a costume party where the inmates come as catatonic Pierrots, deranged Columbines and 15-foot giants and film it through gauze to drugged music. Let the star act at the party be a mime show where the actors, also inmates, sag sadly at one another.If I haven't lost count, Mauro Bolognini has managed to mount a metaphor upon a second metaphor that is mounted, in turn, upon a third metaphor. All were exhausted to begin with: Is he trying to kill them? He shouldn't, because he will undoubtedly want to use them again.\\"Down the Ancient Stairs.\\" which opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie, puts Marcello Mastroianni in the role of Professor Bonaccorsi, chief psychiatrist at the asylum. It is a Mastroianni role in that he is the lover of the wives of the asylum's director and surgeon and of one of the nurses. It also works up the actor's bent for being gloomy about it, as a man might be gloomy between bouts of compulsive overeating.Professor Bonaccorsi's satyriasis—he fondles the patients as well as his colleagues—is metaphysical. He is obsessed with insanity: with establishing that there is indeed a difference between himself and the patients. At the asylum he sets himself up as a kind of godlike figure, running everything, holding off everyone—staff and patients — with busyness and with a show, often a physical show, of love.Into this closed world comes Anna Bersani, a young woman doctor played by Françoise Fabian. She resists Bonaccorsi's advances, she questions his methods. To nail down his insistence that there is a clear demarcation between the sane and insane, Bonaccorsi keeps searching for a physical determinant of insanity.One day he finds it, or thinks he does. He peers through his microscope, he exults. Insanity is a hairy splotch, he announces, appearing on the blood cells. Dr. Bersani checks the experiment and finds it is flawed.Bonaccorsi quits the hospital and gets on a train. But it is Italy of the nineteen-thirties, and the compartment is full of raving Fascists. Not only is there no difference between the inmates and the staff in the asylum, Bolognini suggests, but there is also no difference between the asylum and the rest of the world.It is relentlessly weary stuff","excerpt":"an image so venerable, a paradox so frequently trotted out that it has lost all its original force.Mr. Mastroianni, Miss Fabian and the actresses playing Bonaccorsi's mistresses perform routinely.

He appears as a crook, a man of imagination, who enjoys outwitting other thieves almost as much as he does running his fingers through a pile of glistening loot. This production owes its direction and possibly its origin to Tod Browning, who is in his element when presiding over an underworld story, especially if Mr. Chaney heads the cast.\\"The Big City\\" begins at a swift gallop and ends at a lazy lope. The first half is filled with ingenious ideas, with surprise following surprise, but when Mr. Browning attacks the reformation of the leading gangster he permits the pace of his story to slacken until it becomes slightly tedious.After a few flashes of this yarn it looks as though the Chaney-Browning combination had turned out a companion picture to \\"The Unholy Three.\\" Mr. Browning depicts a night club in full swing, with two dancers, black hoods covering their heads, and soon these dancers whip out pistols and threaten the patrons of the place. It is not long before money and jewelry have been collected, and Mr. Browning elects to show some of the gems hidden in a dish of spaghetti, with the crafty \\"Chuck\\" Collins (Mr. Chaney) explaining this part of the evening's haul. Subsequently a couple of handfuls of pearls are seen in a cardboard box, and a guileless girl, taking them to be imitation, calmly sews some of them on a gown.\\"Chuck\\" Collins had heard of \\"Red\\" Watson's scheme to rob the night club, and he employs the same tactics as Watson had outlined, only he sees to it that Watson's underlings are gagged and bound in a safe place. Hence, Watson imagines that his stunt is eminently successful and to cover suspicion concerning himself, he willingly parts with his own belongings. Watson's rage can easily be imagined when he discovers that \\"Chuck\\" not only has the valuables of the people at the night club, but also a few of his own possessions.Marceline Day figures as the unsuspecting \\"Sunshine,\\" who while working in a shop for Collins never for an instant thinks that her employer's dealings are shady. She is at first most exasperating to Collins, who is aided in his robberies by Helen, a pretty girl who tones down her looks by spectacles, and \\"Curly,\\" a young man who eventually decides that \\"Sunshine\\" is quite attractive.Collins is severe with his colleagues. When \\"Curly\\" rebels, Collins knocks him down and \\"Curly,\\" having a sense of humor, explains to Helen that \\"Poppa had spanked him,\\" When Curly tries to embrace \\"Sunshine,\\" it is Collins who again punishes Curly, and then Collins finds himself affected by \\"Sunshine's\\" blind sincerity and faith.Mr. Chaney has considered carefully what Collins ought to wear. This crook has a penchant for stripes, both in his suits and his neckties. Mr. Chaney's performance is excellent, but, through no fault of his, the latter episodes are hardly convincing. Marceline Day is admirable as \\"Sunshine.\\" Betty Compson gives a capital performance as Helen and Matthew Betz is splendid as Watson.There are several diverting numbers in Boris Petroff's stage contribution, \\"On Parade,\\" but the doggerel rhyme uttered by Walt Roesner and one or two of the men in his orchestra, is more irritating than entertaining.

There is growing evidence that the death squads or, as they are called, \\"extermination groups\\" are made up of police officers. These killings in secret are often brutal, the bodies found tortured and mutilated. Death squads are reported to have killed more than 300 people during 1990 in Rio de Janeiro state.   The victims are mostly poor, destitute and young","excerpt":"an increasing number are children. In some cases, they're suspected of having committed petty crimes. In other cases, they just happen to dwell on the streets. Some seven million children live in the streets, often begging and resorting to petty crime to survive.   One mother's tragedy speaks for all. In February 1988, two teen-age brothers, Aldenir Calisto Mendes and Magno Fernando Mendes were abducted from their home in Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, at midnight, by armed men who maintained that they were the police. The men forced their way into the home without an arrest warrant or any identification. They told the boy's mother that they had to take her sons to the police station for questions.    The mother suspected that the men were part of a death squad, and she went to report the abduction to the police. At the station, the police chief told her she had to wait 24 hours before she could report the boys missing. She resumed her search at 6 A.M. the next day and subsequently overheard someone in a local bakery talking about the bodies of two young men found nearby. They were her sons.   When are Brazilian authorities going to investigate the brutal killings? When are they going to stop death squad activities and threats, such as those recently directed at Wolmer do Nascimento and his two young children? Mr. Nascimento is well known for his work on behalf of the street children and his denunciations of death-squad killings of minors.   Are children in Brazil viewed as nothing more than unpleasant bugs to be exterminated and left lying in garbage dumps?

William championed the redevelopment of disadvantaged communities in New York City devastated by the effects of decades of rent control laws and led the battle, with his close friend Sheldon Katz, in the late 1960s and 70s to win control of the Rent Stabilization Association (RSA), where he remained on the Executive Committee of the Board, passionate about the organization's purpose and devoted to his colleagues. He co-founded the Community Housing Improvement Program (CHIP), dedicated to the issues of small property owners, where he remained Chairman Emeritus, always devoted to its members and leaders. Together these two organizations represent the owners of all rent regulated apartments in New York City. He was a lifelong member of the Real Estate Board of New York, member of the Board of Directors of the Realty Advisory Board and accomplished Chairman of his family real estate investment firm. A graduate of the High School of Music and Art, William played the saxophone, clarinet and bassoon in orchestras, including in Carnegie Hall, before serving in the Navy at the end of WWII, and in 1977 was one of the first Americans to travel to China with his architect and friend William Gleckman.
