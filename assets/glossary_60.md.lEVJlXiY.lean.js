There was blues in Texas long before T-Bone Walker's first recorded electric guitar solo in 1940, and blues will undoubtedly live on there. Indeed, since the idiom's ultimate source has never been pinpointed, some authorities have taken literally the old blues line \\"The blues came from Texas, loping like a mule,\\" and asserted that blues must have originated there.   But the image of Texas blues as a distinctive regional form has long centered on the hornlike, single-string lead-guitar style pioneered by T-Bone Walker. And before his death in a helicopter crash in August, Stevie Ray Vaughan - who shares billing on \\"Family Style\\" with his older brother, the guitarist Jimmie Vaughan - had made Texas-rooted, virtuoso blues guitar-playing, revved and leavened with rock, an important part of the commercial pop-music scene for the first time since the heyday of white blues in the late 60's. A further connection links Walker and the Vaughan brothers: the three guitarists grew up in the same Dallas neighborhood, Oak Cliff.   Mosaic - long known for its high-quality, limited-edition boxed sets of hard-to-find jazz recordings - is making its first foray into blues with the T-Bone Walker set (MR9-130 for LP's, MD6-130 for CD's","excerpt":"available from Mosaic Records, 35 Melrose Place, Stamford, Conn. 06902). But it isn't a very big jump, given the jazz milieu Walker worked in during much of the 30's and 40's.   As a child, Walker often led Blind Lemon Jefferson, the first Texas blues recordings star, from bar to bar in Dallas, watching while he played and absorbing his style. In fact, a young Walker made his recording debut in 1929 as Oak Cliff T-Bone, which is not included in the Mosaic box. But on that record he was featured mainly as a vocalist, as he was when he recorded again, in 1940, as a member of the Les Hite Band in Los Angeles, where the Mosaic set begins.   In the meantime, Walker had become friendly with the then-unknown guitarist Charlie Christian, who later set the jazz world on its ear and became the first electric guitarist in modern jazz. One can only imagine what Walker and Christian sounded like playing together on Dallas street corners in the 30's. But while Walker's dry-toned, spidery guitar lines owe much to the style of Blind Lemon Jefferson, his friendship with Christian, and the years he spent playing in jazz and dance bands before becoming a solo star, also had an impact.   Walker often introduced his slow blues with jazzy chord voicings, and the occasional pop ballad performances on the Mosaic collection demonstrate that he was a well-rounded musician. But blues was his forte and first love, and he stayed with it. Virtually every modern blues guitarist, from B. B. King to Stevie Ray Vaughan, has named Walker a prime inspiration. Walker's influence was so inescapable that blues guitarists from the Mississippi Delta to Chicago and from New York to Los Angeles had adapted elements of his approach by the early 50's.   Mosaic's boxed set covers the years of Walker's greatest fame within the black community and catches him at the height of his powers. It is also, incidentally, a fascinating history of changing rhythms in black popular music. On some of the earlier selections, his sense of timing seems at odds with the swing-jazz orientation of the backing musicians, especially when he uses some of the hammering, repeated one-note riff figures most rock-and-roll fans associate with Chuck Berry, another Walker disciple.   Once he signed a contract with Imperial Records in 1950 and was able to use bands more in his groove, almost everything he recorded had an easy, relaxed rhythmic flow, from aching, slow blues to the most up-tempo boogies. One also hears the gradual development of the shuffle rhythm, long a mainstay of Texas blues and possibly a result of rhythm sections trying to reproduce, in an ensemble setting, some of the propulsive left-hand riffs introduced by boogie-woogie pianists. For a mammoth one-artist collection, the T-Bone Walker box is remarkably consistent and engaging, whether listened to intensively or piecemeal.   One might guess from the pervasiveness of the Walker influence that the Vaughan brothers would have grown up playing similarly, but this was not the case. Jimmie Vaughan, a founding member of the Fabulous Thunderbirds until he left the band last June, has never concentrated on developing flash or virtuosity. He is, rather, one of the great band guitarists, able to suggest lead and rhythm figures while anchoring the swing of the group and filling out its sound. This style certainly has its Texas precedence - Frankie Lee Sims comes to mind. When Jimmie Vaughan is soloing, he tends to play tricky, highly syncopated lead melodies spiced liberally with hard-riffing chordal figures; even out front, he plays like a member of the band, not like a hot-shot soloist.   His younger brother was the very epitome of the hot-shot soloist, so much so that most of the criticism he received during his lifetime concerned his abundance of bravura and flash. But during the last few years, Stevie Ray Vaughan had matured considerably. It is still difficult to mistake one Vaughan for the other on \\"Family Style\\" (Epic 46225; all three formats), but both brothers play with an effectively taut economy throughout, and their interaction as rhythm players is a special treat.   The solo honors, of course, go largely to Stevie Ray Vaughan, who turns in two of his most spectacular solos on record on the songs \\"Brothers\\" and \\"Long Way From Home.\\" But this album also finds the brothers expanding from their blues roots into more varied musical terrain, with touches of Cajun, soul, 50's rock-and-roll, modern funk and even gospel music.   At the time of his death, Stevie Ray Vaughan seemed to have been moving toward a more eclectic style of playing, incorporating more of his brother's incisive rhythm. \\"Family Style,\\" the last studio album he recorded, serves as a worthy testament to his talent by placing it in a specifically Texas-rooted, family context. In the meantime, Jimmie Vaughan plays on, as exciting, unpredictable and underrated as ever. And Mosaic's T-Bone Walker set is now available to bring the sound of the Vaughans' musical godfather to a new generation of listeners. Historic Bookends to Texas Blues"},{"year":"1982","title":"One of the profound artistic calamities of the 20th century was the early death, from leukemia, of the Rumanian pianist Dinu Lipatti.  Only 33 when he died in 1950, he was recognized as a prodigious talent while still a child, and began his recording career at the age of 19. In his few remaining years, Mr. Lipatti made only a scant handful of recordings, yet these have guaranteed his posthumous reputation, as they are on a uniformly high level.   Now Angel has distilled a four-record set (ZD 3924) from a more comprehensive seven-disk EMI/ Electrola reissue (IC-197-53780/86M","excerpt":"available from the German News Company) and has made it available on the American market. It is a fine package, and contains sterling performances of works by Bach, Mozart, Scarlatti, Chopin, Liszt, Ravel and Georges Enesco - the pianist's godfather.   Mr. Lipatti's pianism combined a rare delicacy and grace with a rock-hard structural muscle, passion with a certain Olympian detachment. His repertory was limited - he was best known as a performer of Bach, Mozart and Chopin - but this was attributable to his uncompromisingly self-critical nature rather than any pianistic shortcomings. Until late in his life, Mr. Lipatti had never publicly performed the music of Beethoven: he claimed that he did not yet feel equal to the challenge. But what he chose to play, he played splendidly; although he was not a bravura pianist, and he shunned gratuitous showmanship, his technique was impeccable.

David Beckham (a) may hold the title of soccer's No. 1 fashion plate, but recently some other players have been earning peacock status. Giorgio Armani chose Kaká, the Brazilian forward for A.C. Milan, for his spring jeans campaign, while A.C. Milan's Ukrainian striker, Andriy Shevchenko (European Footballer of the Year in 2004), has been promoting Emporio Armani's sunglasses (b).    2. The Arsenal striker Thierry Henry was shot last year for the cover of Arena Homme Plus (a) by Alasdair McLellan. McLellan's ultimate muse, however, is the rough-and-tumble footy wonder Wayne Rooney (b) of Manchester United. ''He's the opposite of David Beckham,'' McClellan says of the 19- year-old Rooney, who has the face of a hooligan pup. ''He looks like any kid from the north of England.'' Elsewhere, the Belgian designer Dirk Bikkembergs is so enthralled by soccer that he has created a capsule football collection for fall, including cleats (c) and uniforms (d).    3. Miuccia Prada's favorite Swiss architects Herzog and de Meuron have designed the 66,000-seat Allianz Arena in Munich, which will be the site of the kickoff game to the 2006 World Cup. The stadium, a futuristic creation shaped like a lozenge, is sheathed in foil and light panels that illuminate blue, red and white lights -- the colors of the hometown teams, F.C. Bayern Munich and T.S.V. Munich 1860. Meanwhile, the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, one of the last remnants of Albert Speer's Nazi architecture, has been spiffed up in time to set the stage for the World Cup finals.    4. Soccer is also getting wall space. ''The Ball in Our Head'' is opening at the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg this November. The exhibition celebrates everything related to soccer, including one fan's shrine to the Argentinian star Juan Román Riquelme. The curators, Per Rumberg and Ulrich Crowell, have compiled iconic shots of the World Cup since 1930 (like the one here), which they plan to display at the Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin next April. ''We are trying to capture what makes soccer so compelling to so many thousands of fans worldwide, what makes it a cornerstone of our cultural heritage,'' Rumberg says. Stateside, Hollywood is also hoping to score. The Knicks fan Spike Lee is swapping balls and is the executive producer of ''The Goal,'' tracing the rise of a football hopeful from a Rio favela to the stadium's klieg lights. Then there's ''Goal!,'' with Diego Luna, Beckham, Zinedine Zidane and Raul. And Elijah Wood is in ''Hooligans,'' about a Yank who slips into the rowdy world of British soccer thugs.    5.

Some copies of the album also come with a bonus disc, and it's there that you'll find a remix called ''Sodom.'' It starts with a pinprick-sharp rhythm and a slightly dirty-sounding bass line. Neil Tennant's breathy voice eventually arrives (''I lived a quiet life/ A stranger to Champagne''), and for the next six minutes the song keeps mutating: it sounds, by turns, like a New Order outtake, a fidgety minimalist experiment and a sleazy club track.    This remix is the work of ANDERS TRENTEMOLLER, a Danish producer and D.J. whose sleek, vaguely menacing tracks and remixes have earned him a devoted following in Europe, and a devoted (but much smaller) following in America, too. His debut full-length album, credited simply to Trentemoller, is a seductive CD called ''The Last Resort'' (Poker Flat","excerpt":"available through forcedexposure.com). It consists of 14 interlocking, mainly electronic compositions, though recognizable instruments occasionally show up: what he calls ''surf guitars'' on one track, a glockenspiel on another. This is moody, mysterious music, and like many meticulous dance-music producers from Europe, Mr. Trentemoller finds ways to hint at two very different places at once: a nearly empty bedroom and a not-at-all-empty nightclub.    For the most part, American fans of music like this are best off sticking to bedrooms. But on Thursday night, Mr. Trentemoller is coming to town for a gig at Cielo, in the meatpacking district.

F. E. sponsored at the World Theatre yesterday, most customers will recognize a format as old as the hills—the bedroom farce, mixed, this time, with politics. Familiar, thin and resurrected it unquestionably is, every step of the way.Oddly enough, even with generally salty dialogue and some pointed fade-outs on Miss Pampanini in the clinches, the general tone is innocuously amoral, rather than offensive. However, the Italians had the right idea in, reportedly, barring youngsters under 16.Taken exactly for what it is, a frankly appreciative study of Miss Pampanini in a complicated marital mix-up, the picture remains diverting in a simple-minded way. Some of it is downright funny.Perfectly cast, Miss Pampanini plays a predatory entertainer who runs afoul of an elderly strait-laced judge and spitefully plants herself in his home during his wife's absence. Mistaken identity carries Miss Pampanini all the way to Paris, where she is taken for the judge's wife. Her casual deportment all but wrecks the Ministry of Justice.Toward the half-way mark, the genuine fun congeals in a confused game of office hide-and-seek, complete with yelpings about infidelity, bigamy and disloyalty. Never have so many office doors abruptly opened and banged shut.This limp homestretch notwithstanding, ancient French sauce profits from added Italian garlic. Director Pietro Germi has underscored the proceedings with a brisk, take-it-or-leave-it attitude. Furthermore, Miss Pampanini is run some peppery interference by an able and droll supporting cast, excepting, perhaps, Carlo Dapporto, as Minister Godet, her prime target. The most persuasive are Luigi Pavese, as the hapless judge","excerpt":"Ave Ninchi, as his bumbling wife; and one unspecified actor as the Minister's assistant who methodically makes his superior's life miserable.

The populist President Néstor Kirchner's early payoff of Argentina's International Monetary Fund debt, and less-than-friendly treatment of President Bush at the Summit of the Americas in November, played well in a country tired of international advice, and in last October's midterm elections Mr. Kirchner's mascara-caked wife, Cristina, won a senate seat amid a wave of Evita nostalgia. The economy is booming, too: After hitting bottom in 2002, it bounced back in 2004 and 2005, a turnaround that is visible in the sheer number of new apartment towers and clothing stores popping up in the trendy Palermo area. And yet it is still shockingly inexpensive, with first-rate meals rarely costing more than 78 pesos a person, or $25 at 3.14 Argentine pesos to $1.      During this recovery, international skepticism about the local economy has meant that the exchange rate has actually improved for American travelers, with the peso recently falling to a three-year low against the dollar. The downside is that there has been a surge in the cost of living in a land as famous for its explosive inflation as for its huge steaks. With the economic boom predicted to continue for 2006, travelers might be advised to visit before inflation makes Argentina no longer the eye-popping bargain it has been since 2002.
