It happened through the Movietone at the Globe Theatre and even the celebrated literary light might have enjoyed his own mimicry of Mussolini. There was in it a suggestion of embarrassment, as he sparred with \\"well, well,\\" and then remembered that\\" when he was saying \\"good night,\\" there might be occasions when there were afternoon audiences, so he added \\"good afternoon,\\" and \\"good luck.\\"This Shaw talking picture is a remarkable achievement for besides bringing to this country the utterances of the playwright and author, it also brought his actual voice, with his indubitable charm of intonation. It gave the audience an indelible conception of Shaw as he is, with his ever delightful tongue-in-the-cheek manner. He had evidently viewed the Movietone of Mussolini, wherein that Italian Dictator emerged from his palatial domain in Rome with the tread of a cavalry officer and the bearing of a Napoleon. Mr. Shaw Issues forth from an English bush, and, as his shadow becomes more distinct, it is perceived that he was wearing a Norfolk jacket and knee breeches. He looked to be in excellent health, vigorous and ready for a battle of wits.As Mr. Shaw hesitates about his speech, perhaps just a little awed by the machinery before him, he suddenly strikes a familiar pose of II Duce, with a frown that causes his eyebrows to make almost a horizontal line with the bridge of his nose. The expression is one that is instantly reminiscent of the pictures of Mussolini. The author of \\"Plays Pleasant and Unpleasant,\\" \\"Saint Joan\\" and many other works then proceeds to explain that while Mussolini invariably appears with a frown, he (Shaw) can throw off the mask of severity and be his engaging self. Here Mr. Shaw raises his eyebrows, opens his eyes wide and appears in a jocular mood, addressing his imaginary audience with evident relish, apparently appreciating that quite a few hundred thousand persons are going to sit watching his Movietone talk.Mr. Shaw says that he is \\"very happy to be here,\\" as people who have only read his books and never seen him have fancied that he is a curious individual, whereas they can now see for themselves that he is an affable and pleasant person.The first Movietone comedy, \\"The Family Picnic,\\" was then presented, and although the voices were a little loud during some passages, the subject was one that afforded a heap of amusement. It depicts a family going out on a picnic in an automobile and not a little consternation was created last night when it was revealed that after all the trouble of preparing things the all-important food basket had been left on the curbstone outside the dwelling. This meant an abrupt return and a new start on the trip.Richard Bonelli, the opera singer, in another Movietone subject, is seen and heard rendering the \\"prologue\\" from \\"Pagliacci.\\" With all its splendid vocal quality, this feature is a trifle too loud, rather like a giant singing in stentorian tones.There are also several Movietone news reel subjects, which give one a conception of the potential possibilities of this device, which not only takes the animated shadow to the four corners of the earth but also the voice.Following the sound and shadow entertainment there was presented \\"The Red Dance,\\" a pictorial drama of Russia, before and after the revolution. There is a good deal of lethargy about the opening chapters of this offering, but interest picks up in the latter passages, those concerned with the overthrow of the Romanoffs and the triumph of the proleteriat. These incidents are pictured entertainingly, with a mingling of satire and burlesque.The subtitles of this production rather make Tasia, a peasant girl, talk like an educated settlement worker. Nearly all the characters argue too much and there is often hardly the faintest suggestion of peasant parlance, but rather that of the slang or phraseology of America.Nevertheless, it is quite amusing to perceive that the burly beef-eating giant, Ivan Petroff, played by Ivan Linow, appreciates the humor of the change in the government. He says that it is strange that he is now a General","excerpt":"Tasia, a dancer at the Moscow Theatre, and the village barber a Minister of Education—that is when he can read the appointment.There are some good scenes in this somewhat wild piece of work, but it is often incoherent. It has evidently been cut before being screened.Charles Farrell plays the part of a Russian Grand Duke, a personage who is to marry the Princess Varvara. He is quite becoming in his long cloak. A number of the characters usually dodged in Russian film stories are pictured in this chronicle. There are occasional flashes of Rasputin and Trotzky, and the former is held to blame for the conditions of the soldiers. Masses of prisoners are depicted in a queer circular prison and in the latter sequences these captives are liberated. G.

New Zealand was settled by Maori voyagers from Polynesia from about the ninth century A.D. The first European to sight it was the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, in 1642; he named it, but did not take possession. In 1769, Capt. James Cook visited and claimed it for Britain. The first British missionaries arrived in 1814, and New Zealand became a full-fledged British colony in 1841. By the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, the Maoris recognized Queen Victoria's protection and agreed to admit British settlers; in return, they were guaranteed possession of their lands. But in a series of bloody wars lasting until 1870, the Maoris were displaced from lands devoted to the expanding British settlements. As a result of their defeat and of introduced diseases, the Maori population dwindled to about 40,000 by the 1890's. Their numbers have since recovered to over 400,000, and in recent decades, the Maoris have become a cohesive culture and significant political force, directly electing several members of Parliament. In 1985, the Waitangi Tribunal was given power to hear Maori claims for repayment for land taken without compensation since the 1840 treaty. Large financial settlements were negotiated by the government. New Zealand was one of the first nations to introduce universal adult suffrage (1893) and to establish a comprehensive welfare state. Legislation beginning in 1898 regulates labor practices, and mandates universal old-age pensions, public sector medical care, and other social services. Since 1907, the country has been an independent member of the British Commonwealth. The crown is represented by a governor-general; government is drawn from a parliament and headed by a prime minister. Since the 1930's, government has alternated between the National and Labour parties. New Zealand troops fought on the side of the Allies in both world wars, with U.N. forces in Korea, and with the U.S. in Vietnam. In 1951, New Zealand joined Australia and the U.S. in the ANZUS mutual-defense treaty, but was excluded from it in 1986 after denying port facilities to ships carrying nuclear weapons. New Zealand has also objected strenuously to French testing of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific and pressed for a comprehensive international nuclear test ban treaty. Upon its election in 1984, the Labour government launched a profound economic restructuring program to transform the country from a protected agrarian economy to an open free-market economy. This program, continued by the National Party, which regained power in 1990, eliminated government subsidies, cut government spending, liberalized imports, deregulated financial markets, reduced tax rates, and deregulated the labor market, largely disempowering the unions. The reforms resulted in an expanding and competitive economy with low inflation, and, in 1993–94, the first budget surplus in 18 years. The government responded in 1995 by cutting taxes again. 1996 election results, however, forced the Nationalist Party into coalition with the new populist/zenophobic New Zealand First Party. The terms commit the new government to defer tax cuts, halt sales of state-owned businesses, freeze immigration levels, and increase spending on health and education. The coalition lasted 19 months until New Zealand First left the cabinet over government plans to privatize Wellington International Airport. Yet the government did not fall as votes of confidence in September 1998 and February 1999 permitted continuance of a minority government headed by New Zealand's first female prime minister, Jenny Shipley. Nine years of National Party rule ended in 1999 as a coalition government of Labor and Alliance established Helen Clark as prime minister. In June 2001 elections, the Nationalists garnered only 27 seats, their worse showing in their 66-year history. Clark's Labour Party gained 52 seats. Without a formal coalition, an alliance with the Greens yielded exactly 60 of the 120 votes.

After four visits, we must conclude that the inconsistent kitchen sometimes betrays the dining room. Dishes superb on one visit proved only fair on another.  Sampled on four different occasions, coulibiac, for instance, arrived one time as a dense, ravishingly light, melting mixture of sole mousse studded with bits of salmon, the buttery whole wafting dill and bound in pastry crust.

He goes through life taking no unecessary risks and in his first taste of war finds he can't press the trigger that will kill a sniper.There's poor, irrepressible, happy-go-lucky Dooley, whose idea of a four-day pass is Gina, Tina and vino. His credo is that plenty of \\"green stuff is the only thing that really counts: enough to make his life's dream come true — to build the most, beautiful restaurant in New Jersey.And there's Preacher, son of the town drunkard","excerpt":"taught the ways of the devil by a Godfearing uncle. For him war is kill or be killed, and evil in any form must be destroyed—whether it's in a man's soul or a nation; and whose righteousness overpowers his will to forgive.It is in the unconvincingly etched character of Preacher that this otherwise fine parable by scenarist Robert Lewin goes astray. It starts when Fairchild pays Fiamma, a beautiful prostitute, to tempt Preacher. Preacher would rather look at a church. And when they're out in the country, she with a bottle of wine, do you know what he says he'd like? A glass of buttermilk.Preacher eventually responds and, in fact, they fall in love. But it's all over when he finds out that Fiamma had been in close touch with much of the Fifth Army.Aside from this, Mr. Lewin and director Lewis R. Foster have created dramatic and comic touches that are superb. This includes probably the most fabulous crap game since the birth of the bones in ancient Egypt, Greece or Rome. It comes to pass in a tent and continues frantically through an air raid under blankets by the light of a lantern.Wendell Corey as Fairchild, Don Taylor as Preacher and Nicole Maurey as Fiamma handle their roles well.

Budget-neutral measures, like funding roads with gas taxes, are virtually employment-neutral, too.\\n\\nEstablishment orthodoxy, however, blames deficits for the depression and urges fiscal austerity to lower interest rates and promote recovery. These propositions were not valid in the 1930's and are not today. The economy suffers, now as then, from weak markets for goods and services; curtailing any demands, including those of governments and taxpayers, is counterproductive. Interest rates might decline, reviving some demands for cars and houses. But could the increase in demand induced by lower interest rates more than compensate for the loss of demand induced by lower spending or higher taxes?

Many one-year municipal notes mature on June 30, the usual end of a fiscal year, which can lead to a scramble by money market funds to reinvest.   New York State, meanwhile, is expected to offer $195 milliion of general obligation bonds by competitive bidding on July 31.

So, approaching the new year, it is timely to review some details of the new tax act, which is chock full of special provisions that will allow people to build generous tax-favored retirement nest eggs, dabble in new investments and even get married with Uncle Sam's blessings.   ''It's a brand new ball game, and people really have some unusual opportunities to do some long-range financial planning,'' said James Conway, president of the Ayco Corporation, a financialcounseling company.   The provision that will probably have the most significant impact on middle-income families allows all workers, even those covered by company pension plans, to set up their own Individual Retirement Accounts. Not only are contributions to these accounts tax deductible, but also the interest earned on them accumulates taxfree until the person withdraws the funds at age 59 1/2 or later.  At that time, the earnings would be treated - and taxed - as ordinary income, but if the saver has retired, presumably the tax would be at a lower rate that the investor pays currently.

Cuomo of New York is advocating a 10 cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase (news article, Jan. 29). While higher taxes for highway use are appropriate, the Governor seeks a tax on the wrong user. A tax on gasoline is a tax on the automobile, not on the truck. The Governor's proposal misses the opportunity to reduce the $2.8 billion subsidy to the trucking industry that is buried within the highway budget. This subsidy, exceeding half the state's projected deficit, is indefensible when children cannot be fed, educated or given adequate medical care for lack of money.   A Department of Transportation study has determined that trucks are responsible for 90 percent of all highway costs. That study found that all the taxes and fees paid by the trucking industry cover only 30 percent of those costs.   New York State spent in 1987 (the last year for which statistics are available) $4.67 billion on its highway system. After all road-use taxes, tolls and fees from all sources were credited ($2.04 billion) state taxpayers had to pay $2.6 billion from general revenues to subsidize the highway system. As local roads receive little state or Federal fuel-tax revenue and are particularly vulnerable to damage from heavy loads, a huge proportion is provided by local property taxes and local sales taxes.   It is irrational for the taxpayer-motorist to subsidize the trucker, who makes the use of his car dangerous. It is irrational for a state pressed by budget problems thus to reduce the cost of truck transport, causing more freight every year to pulverize the highways and increase the taxpayer maintenance bill.   The assessment of fair-road-use taxes on trucks will not only provide needed revenue to maintain the roads but also make nonhighway freight modes more attractive. The carnage caused by the mix of heavy trucks with automobiles will be diminished. The taxpayer, particularly at the local level, will not be required to sacrifice education, firehouses and health care to provide nearly free roads for trucks. JOHN F.

If, for example, the idea of lower expectations were to lead people to accept as inevitable our present state -dirty streets, neighborhoods tense with random crime, a stunted educational program and a transit system that is a constant snarl - then governors and mayors would be largely relieved of the political need to make conditions significantly better.
