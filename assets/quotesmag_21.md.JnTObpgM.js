The Gallagher briefing, transcribed by Reuters, took place early today and the Pepin briefing, from the Associated Press, was on Sunday:  Gallagher Statement    I have a brief statement concerning the most recent Scud attacks on Saudi Arabia. The United States Central Command is in the process of evaluating information on the two salvos of Scud missiles launched by Iraq into Saudia Arabia in the past 24 hours.    We now believe 10 missiles were launched and U.S. Patroit air defense systems shot down nine of them. Iraq fired the first launch of the three Scud missiles into eastern Saudi Arabia at about 9:50 P.M. Saudi time. They were engaged by five Patriot air defense missiles and were shot down near Dhahran. In the second attack, about 12:45 A.M. this morning, Jan. 21 Saudi time, Iraq fired seven Scud missiles: four at Riyadh, two at Dhahran, and one in the waters off Dhahran. Six of these Scuds were shot down by Patriot missiles. The Scud missile landing in the water did not require engagement.    We have no reports yet of damage or injuries. The number of Patriot missiles fired at the incoming Scuds in the second set of launches is still not available at this time. All the missiles were thought to be carrying high-explosive warheads.    That concludes my statement. And now I'll take your questions. Yes, sir, in the back?    Q: Could you say where the one which landed in the water actually landed, with the help of a map, perhaps?    A: What I understand is it was just off the waters off -- in the waters off Dhahran. And because of its trajectory was the reason it didn't require engagement.   Q: There was a loud explosion heard in Bahrain, Mike","excerpt":"would that have been the one?   A: I just -- I can't say for sure. Right here?    Q: Colonel, any reports of errant Patriot missiles landing in the city here?    A: No, we've not received any such reports, and we've not received any kind of damage reports either. Yes. Missile on the Horizon    Q: Colonel, a number of us saw what appeared to be a missile landing in the southeastern horizon, as viewed from the hotel, landing with a flash on the horizon. Would -- I know you may not want to speculate, but would you guess that this could have been either an errant Patriot or that it could have been a Scud?   A: O.K., you're talking about the four in the Riyadh area?   Q: The Riyadh area. I'm sorry, yeah.    A: No, I can't say what that might have been, but again, just to repeat on those -- the ones in the Riyadh area -- all four were engaged and destroyed. Any other questions? Yes, ma'am?   Q: Yes, some of us have just seen a crater that looks like it was from a missile or something landing.   A: O.K., the question was whether or not there was a crater or not, and right now U.S. Centcom has not received any such information.   Q: There were some sightings of at least one Patriot that appeared to leave its point and go at a very low altitude horizontally for about a mile and a half where there is a now a large crater and a damaged building. There are a number of Saudi authorities there. Has anyone from Centcom gone out to try to get a damage assessment?   A: O.K. I don't have any information on this particular incident, but we'll be glad to take that question for you. O.K., in the back of the room: Go ahead. Description of Crater    Q: We just got back from this crater where it blew out the back side of a building and left a hole in the ground about 10 feet deep and about 13, 14 feet wide. There were pieces of missile all over the place a mile and a half down the road.   A: O.K. We'll take a look at that, and whatever information I can get on it for you I'll be glad to. Anybody else? Yes?    Q: Would a Patriot be capable of causing a crater 10 feet deep and 14 feet wide?    A: I can't answer that for sure. I don't know about the size.   Q: How much explosives are in a Patriot?   A: I'd have to get the information for you.  Pepin Statement    Emphasis continues to be placed on offensive counter-air and interdiction missions. The objectives of the large-scale interdiction air strikes continue to be the destruction of major Iraqi military complexes, the Republican Guards, airfields, air defense assets, long-range artillery and missile sites, and command and control elements.   As of today, the continuous operations have raised the total count for Operation Desert Storm sorties to over 7,000. As of 6 o'clock  [ Sunday evening ]  our aircraft were responsible for destroying 15 Iraqi aircraft in air-to-air combat, of which 10 were MIG-29 Fulcrums, 4 were F-1 Mirages, and we believe the 15th aircraft to be a MIG-23 Flogger. Of this total, 5 have been shot down today.    As of today, the United States has incurred 8 aircraft losses due to enemy fire. The Navy has lost 1 F-18 and 2 A-6E's, the Marine Corps 1 OV-10 and the Air Force 2 F-15E's and 2 F-16's. Additionally, 1 Air Force F-4G has been lost in non-battle damage.    .  .  .     Currently, 19 floating contact mines have been found. All have been found in the northern Arabian Gulf and all have been destroyed by coalition demolition teams. The Navy is also actively seeking, and if located will attack, Iraqi naval craft. Additionally, the Navy has continued to enforce United Nations resolutions and sanctions of the maritime intercept operations.

Dressed in the proper gear and playing brass and double-reed instruments of the era, the Hopewell Renaissance Band does the musical honors with a program that includes works by Josquin des Prez and Michael Praetorius. The concert, followed by a reception, is at 2:30 P.M. at the Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay. Tickets are $7.50.      OLD-FASHIONED HOLIDAY   This season affords historical societies the opportunity to give a fresh look to some of their favorite old things. This year, among the local museums celebrating the season in a special way, not only is the Victoria House on School Street in Bayville replete with decorations from that period - including a cranberry-and apple-laden Christmas tree with authentic toys, and an old-style train under its boughs - but the holiday exhibition is enhanced today by a Christmas concert at 7 P.M. Penelope Herdt and Bess Bell, sopranos, will join Joseph Graffeo, organist, around the museum's antique pump organ for the 7 P.M. concert, which is free. For regular museum hours call 628-1720.

Woyzeck, a military barber and the most ordinary of common men, is overcome by dementia. He hears strange sounds, sees visions and is driven to a desperate act of murder. Along with \\"Danton's Death,\\" the play certified Georg Buchner's reputation as the first modern playwright. Written in the 1830's and discovered as fragments after the author's death, the work foreshadowed explorations by Kafka, Brecht and Beckett. The modernism of Buchner is basic to JoAnne Akalaitis's compelling production at the Joseph Papp Public Theater.   Because of the nonlinear style and the focus on an irrational antihero, the play is open to free-handed interpretation. In search of \\"Woyzeck,\\" Ms. Akalaitis uses alternate scenes and extracts from early drafts of the play, filtering Henry J. Schmidt's translation through her fervid theatrical imagination.

Legend says they built lightweight craft capable of tremendous speed, and some of the mysteries from that earlier age, when revealed, may help modern designers improve the efficiency of new ships. So Mr. Dyson suggests in a paper to be published next year by the Canadian Museum of Civilization.   The Aleut boats Mr. Dyson is studying are known as \\"baidarkas,\\" a name given to the kayaks by the early Russian explorers in the region. Baidarkas were constructed of flexible wood skeletons covered with animal skins. Extremely narrow, they had distinctive split bows and gave the early hunters the ability to silently stalk their prey with harpoons and bows. When Westerners first arrived in the Aleutian Islands in the 18th century, thousands of these swift boats traveled the waterways of the region.   Baidarkas evolved by trial and error over thousands of years, according to Mr. Dyson, who is one of a small group of researchers now exploring the their design.   The first European explorers to come to the region reported that the Aleut baidarkas could go as fast as as 10 miles per hour for sustained periods. By contrast, modern racing kayaks, made of fiberglass, can reach these speeds only in sprints covering short distances. Recreational kayakers generally travel at less than half these speeds.   Not everyone believes the claims made for the baidarkas. And because few of the boats have survived and designs changed quickly after contact with European cultures and technologies, the question of speed may never be fully resolved.   \\"There are some accounts that can be dismissed as exaggerations,\\" Mr. Dyson acknowledged. \\"But there is a core of quite accurate sitings. The European navigators depended on estimated speed as an important navigational tool.\\"   Researchers acknowledge that there is still much to be learned about surface-vessel hydrodynamics and model building and about the intuitive design techniques used by the Aleuts. Because of the complexity of turbulent fluid flow around the hull of a boat, there is still not a complete mathematical understanding of the interaction of boat designs when waves also become factors.   \\"IT'S an interesting area of research,\\" said Antony Jameson, a researcher at Princeton University. \\"I think its quite likely that they were able to evolve some advanced vehicles with trial and error over periods of centuries.\\" Mr. Dyson believes that research on the ancient craft may answer some modern questions about hydrodynamics and hull design. However, it is unlikely that a full picture of the original boats and their capabilities will ever be known since the designers' methods and intentions have been obscured by the passage of time.   One consequence of contact with Europeans that may have affected the Aleuts' boat-building techniques, was the changing nature of the weapons used by the hunters. Some have note that guns dramatically extended the distance between the hunter and the prey and lessened the need for speed and stealth. The introduction of guns may have also led to wider boat design as more stability was required to counter the force of the weapon's recoil, Mr. Dyson said.   One of the unsolved mysteries in the original baidarka design is whether the split bow was simply an artistic or ritual design -- perhaps to make the boat look more like an animal to unsuspecting prey -- or whether it had some functional purpose.   According to Mr. Dyson, the top part of the bow gave the boats dynamic lift, much as a water ski naturally rides up when it is pulled through the water. At the stern, the early baidarkas were squared off rather than pointed like modern kayaks. This in turn kept the rear of the boats from squatting too deeply in the water.   Similar bow designs have been used in modern vessels. For example, large commercial ships now have bulbous projections below the surface at the bow to cancel the resistance of waves. And Francis Clauser, an engineer at the California Institute of Technology, developed and tested a prototype model for the 1984 Americas Cup which had a striking resemblance to the split bow of the original Aleut ships, also designed to cancel resistance.   A further mystery of baidarka design is the use of bone or ivory as friction-reducing bearings on many surfaces of the wood skeleton's joints. According to Joseph Lubischer, a Canadian kayak researcher, bones were used to increase the stealth of the craft by silencing it. They also added flexibility, permitting it to undulate with the movements of the sea. If Mr. Lubischer is correct, and a flexible hull improves speed and efficiency, it may have applicability in ship design.    MOREOVER, what was the effect of the sometimes translucent sea-lion skins that the baidarkas were wrapped in? The skins were not hard like modern fiberglass hulls, but flexible. Mr. Dyson believes there is evidence that the skins may have aided the Aleuts in obtaining laminar -- or smooth -- fluid flow along the surface of their craft. Obtaining improved laminar flow is an objective boat builders are still trying to achieve for increased speed and less drag.    Today, one of the most imposing problems facing the world's supercomputers is simulating the flow of fluids along a surface. When complicating factors such as the effect of waves are added, say aerodynamicists, the scale of the problem and the computational power needed to model the shapes are enormous, beyond the capabilities of today's most powerful machines.   It is possible, suggests Mr. Dyson, that the Aleut boat designers could have deduced through centuries of close observation, analysis, trial and error and sheer intuition, factors supercomputers are not yet powerful enough to grasp.    A final intriguing piece of evidence that suggests that the boat builders were able to obtain great speeds comes from the remains of the Aleuts themselves. Last summer, anthropologists excavated a previously undisturbed burial cave on one of the Aleutian islands and found new evidence of extremely sophisticated kayak design. In the cave, which is probably about 900 years old, they also found the mummified skeleton of an Aleut kayaker","excerpt":"wrapped with him were two of his paddles.   Dr. William S. Laughlin, an anthropologist at the University of Connecticut at Storrs, who has also studied the skeletons of Russian explorers found in the islands, said that the upper arms of the Aleut kayaker were remarkably well developed.    \\"The Russians are large and well built but their arms look like pipe stems compared to the Aleuts,\\" he said. That would suggest that accounts of high speeds on the part of the Aleuts were indeed accurate.

You too can have a theory about the artist's wrapping of the Reichstag in a million square feet of polypropylene fabric.   Some might consider Christo's accomplishment self-indulgent and banal. But I love the way that hulk of a building has been transformed into a delicate and spectral presence, forcing visitors to contemplate a familiar landmark in a fresh way. Since the Reichstag is to be renovated as the new headquarters of the German Parliament, Christo has also provided the means for a notorious symbol of German imperialism, Nazi villainy and cold-war confrontation to be literally unwrapped as a symbol of a nation's reunification and rebirth. If that sounds too pompous, think of the delicious absurdity of President Reagan lobbying Chancellor Helmut Kohl during a break at the Venice G-7 summit meeting in 1987 to let the project proceed. Think of Chancellor Kohl, grumpily opposed to the wrapping as a trivialization of German aspirations, refusing to go see it even though he was in Berlin. No matter. Like all of Christo's projects, it is transitory, rendering his vision both arrogant and modest. The landscape always returns to its original state.
