The executive chef, Marc Poidevin, and his crew have begun preparing 5,000 pounds of pasta to feed an estimated 14,000 runners who are expected for dinner on Saturday.    All those who enter the marathon are invited to the annual party, which starts at 4 P.M. and continues until 11 P.M. in a tent and in the Crystal Room of the restaurant. Ronzoni, part of Hershey Foods , contributed the pasta, as it has for five years. The pasta will be prepared in a casserole with mushrooms and cream, in a salad with basil and yogurt and in a spicy tomato sauce. There is no charge for registered runners.   Entrants in the marathon who keep kosher will also be treated to a pasta party at the Second Avenue Deli, 156 Second Avenue (10th Street), on Saturday from 8 to 10 P.M. On the menu will be kasha varnishkes, made with buckwheat and bow-tie pasta. Runners must present their credentials at the door and can bring a guest. A Change in Teachers    Beginning in February, the cooking school at the Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., will be run by La Varenne, Anne Willan's school in France. Eight one-week sessions will be held from Feb. 24 through May 3. For the past 13 years the school had been run by Julie Dannenbaum, a cooking instructor from Philadelphia.   The cost, $1,300 a week, includes accommodations. Call Martha Holmberg at (800) 624-6070.  High-School Cook-Off    With recipes that included spaghetti pie and volaille et legumes grilles au thym frais, 15 high school students from New York City, Westchester and Rockland Counties and Long Island participated two weeks ago in a cook-off sponsored by Waldbaum's. Steven Gertner, a 17-year-old senior at Sachem High School North in Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., won with his poached salmon in champagne sauce. He takes cooking classes at Boces II, a continuing-education program in Islip, L.I.   Each of the participants won a $500 scholarship","excerpt":"their schools will receive equipment for their home-economics classes. Mr. Gertner's class will also be treated to an outing to restaurants and food shops in Manhattan.   The cook-off was at the Culinary Art Center of the New York Institute of Technology in Central Islip. The Shop Next Door    For several years, restaurants have been opening shops into adjoining spaces and selling prepared foods. The newest in the trend is Corrado, 1373 Avenue of the Americas (55th Street), which has opened Corrado Kitchen next door.    Some of the colorful salads include tricolor pasta sparked with tangy sun-dried tomatoes that contrast with mellow chunks of mozzarella ($11 a pound), white beans in a herbaceous dressing with nuggets of raw vegetables ($7.80 a pound) and a mixture of tender seafood in a slightly underseasoned vinaigrette ($19 a pound).    The cold sauteed chicken breast cloaked in a creamy mustard sauce ($14 a pound) is better than the rather dry grilled chicken paillard, which is available with a salad ($10.95 a portion) or in a sandwich ($5.95). Desserts are banal, but the classic nut brownie ($1.50) is an exception.   Delivery is free with orders of $8 or more from 48th to 60th Streets, Broadway to Lexington Avenues. Call (212) 333-7696.  Abracadabra In the Kitchen   A HALLOWEEN trick is not quite the same as \\"truc,\\" French for trick. But a new video, \\"Trucs of the Trade,\\" demonstrates such tricks of the kitchen as putting wine corks into a stew to tenderize meat.    In 72 minutes, the tape shows chefs giving dozens of useful tips. For example, Lidia Bastianich, owner of the restaurant Felidia in Manhattan, explains the difference between male and female eggplants (the female has more seeds and less flavor). Antoine Bouterin, chef at Le Perigord, shows how to save a salty sauce by running a sugar cube through it.    The tape, produced by Arlene Feltman, who runs the De Gustibus Cooking School in New York, includes some commercial plugs for its sponsor, the Kobrand Corporation, a wine and spirits importer and distributor. Some of the proceeds from sales are donated to Share Our Strength, a nationwide organization that feeds the hungry.   The tape is $19.95 in video stores or can be ordered by calling (800) 448-2449.

Its wild associations are the kind that come as we drop off to sleep and just before we wake up.It is particularly suited to the passive, divided attention with which we watch television.

Things blur","excerpt":"their sequence is obscure: The result is hilarity under ether.It is hard to transpose this kind of thing to a movie. People have come to see it; they have paid admission; their attention is more sharply focused; the screen image is big, clear and detailed. A two-headed bearded lady can't lope by quietly in the background: she requires to be explained somehow.If \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" worked, it is because the whirling lights were strung along a plot, rudimentary as it may have been.Years after the Goons broke up, Mr. Milligan and their director, Joseph McGrath—both collaborated on the screenplay—have tried to put together a full-length Goon-style picture.\\"The Great McGonagall,\\" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Village, is endearing, and parts of it are lovely and hilarious. But it lacks enough of an organizing principle in its chaos to succeed as a movie.It centers on the true figure of William McGonagall, an unemployed 19th-century Scottish weaver who imagined himself so passionately to be a poet that he in fact wrote verse and got it published. For instance, an ode to a cow:The Hen it is a noble beastThe Cow is more forlorner Standing in the rainWith a leg at every corner.In no way can the plot be summarized. Things happen, one after the other: some belong to McGonagall himself, some to his dreams, some to his dying hallucinations. We struggle too hard — we shouldn't, perhaps, but we do—to disentangle dream from dream and reality from reality.Mr. Milligan is the bearded, gentle McGonagall who prefaces every recitation of his verse with an inarticulate howl that allows everyone time to flee.He sees, or imagines he sees, Queen Victoria at a theater variety show. He is invited, or imagines he is invited, to go to Balmoral Castle to read his poems. He goes, or imagines he does, and is turned away, or imagines he is.The pace is frenetic, the level of reality shifts every two minutes, it is stuffed with visual absurdities, old jokes and take-offs. Some work, some exasperate. McGonagall dances with Queen Victoria—a monotonous, one-joke role played patiently by Peter Sellers—to an orchestra composed of Adolf Hitlers. He and Victoria and Prince Albert pump away at a steam calliope that projects dirty slides to the tune of \\"Amazing Grace.\\"McGonagall does Macbeth on stage, wearing a Band-Aid on his nose. With the vegetables hurled at him he gives a cast party. He locks the doors so the guests can't escape when he recites his poetry.Finally, he lies on his death bed. The poet Tennyson and a man named King Theebaw of the Andaman Islands walk in carrying a decoration from the Queen. They strip to their Victorian underwear and climb decorously into bed with him while his wife serves cookies and tea.McGonagall dies, and you are sorry. Despite his madness, his delusions, his bad poems, you miss him. He is a radiant failure. So, in a way, is his movie, with all bad jokes, carelessness and confusion.

It's a quote about Oz, but it fits the Wizard of Wickwood, Julee Rosso. Ms. Rosso was part of a legendary cookbook writing team with Sheila Lukins","excerpt":"their Silver Palate books sold millions of copies before they parted ways. Ms. Rosso moved to Saugatuck, a quaint town on the east side of Lake Michigan, and, with her husband, Bill Miller, bought Wickwood, where her spirit hovers. ''Julee suggests you drizzle the frittata with just a bit of white truffle oil,'' Luann Raimondo, one of Wickwood's employees -- who were uniformly kind and polite -- said during breakfast at the inn. But on the two mornings I asked if Ms. Rosso was around, I was told with the same cheerfully vague wording, ''She's around, but she's not here right now.'' It would have been nice to meet her.    THE LOCATION -- Wickwood sits in a beautiful and fragrant garden in the center of the town, which is due west of Detroit. The chain ferry, a hand-cranked boat across the Kalamazoo River ($1), is a block away. Marro's, a terrific Italian restaurant, is also within easy walking distance.    THE SCENE -- The 11 rooms, with names like Kyoto and Summer in Santorini, are perfect for romantic getaways; when I was there, guests were young, old, black, white, gay, straight, and all (apparently) in love.    AMENITIES -- Thanks to Ms. Rosso, life at Wickwood revolves around food. Each day began with a lush breakfast (one morning, I had apple bread pudding and cappuccino mousse; another morning, a fabulous frittata). At 6 p.m., the same buffet table was piled with a variety of superb hors d'oeuvres; some guests fill up and don't bother with dinner. Before bedtime, there were more treats, which included brownies and brandy (one as silky as the other). The refrigerator, available to guests 24/7, was stocked with ginger tea, lemonade and fruit juices from heaven. Chocolate-dipped strawberries and a fancy trail-mix were set out in my bedroom.    THE ROOMS -- My room, named Uptown, was decorated with silver-framed photos of New York. And the opulently outfitted bed was stacked with so many pillows it was a chore to take them off. Rooms lack individual temperature controls -- at one point, on a unseasonably warm evening, it was too hot to sleep, and I didn't feel comfortable bothering the staff to adjust the air-conditioning in the middle of the night. Luckily, there was a stack of interesting books next to the bed.    THE BATHROOM -- Small and forgettable. The shower didn't have a lot of pressure. But Wickwood is really about public spaces; the living room, the game room, the porch and the patio couldn't be nicer.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- Rooms are $185 to $365, with a two-night minimum on weekends. But I got a nasty surprise at checkout. When I received my bill, I learned that the $269.50 room rate I had been quoted (and which had been repeated to me after I checked in) was no longer valid; I was being charged $313.50. When I asked how this could be, I was shown a copy of Wickwood's reservation confirmation letter. One sentence had already been highlighted for my convenience: ''Please note that Room Rates and Room Assignment are subject to change without prior notification, and balances are subject to those changes.'' (After returning home, I explained the situation to Ms. Rosso in an e-mail message, without identifying myself as a reporter. A week later, I received a note saying I was being credited $66, a happy if belated resolution.)      Wickwood Inn, 510 Butler Street, Saugatuck, Mich.; (800) 385-1174; www.wickwoodinn.com.   FRED A.

Information technology pioneer. Long time resident of Collingswood, NJ and for the last three years Moorestown, NJ passed away August 26, 2002 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 59 years old. Although Mr. Konecky was raised in New York City, he relocated to the Delaware Valley in 1963 and made it his home after he graduated with a BS in Mathematics from Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY. Nathan Konecky was a pioneer in the computer software and services business. After graduation he began his career working as a Programmer for Sperry Univac (Unisys). In 1968 he founded National System Analysts, Inc. (NSA) and was its CEO/President for all of its years in business. NSA provided systems analysis and programming services to the computer departments of major local companies. By the early 1980's NSA began to be known as ARMS, Inc. (ARMS). In 1996 ARMS was sold to IMI, a subsidiary of Olsen. But Nate was not finished. He carved out eight people from the sale of ARMS, added some family members and founded a new company, Acsis, Inc. (Acsis). It was his idea to run a small family business. But things didn't work out that simple. Acsis specializes in automated data collection and supply chain solutions that interface with SAP, the largest provider of integrated global computer systems. As a ''best of breed'' provider, Acsis has had tremendous success. Today, six years after its founding, Acsis employs 85 people and its software is installed at over 250 sites around the world. Nathan Konecky put together a fantastic management team and Acsis will continue to grow and flourish. Mr. Konecky was well known in the computer industry. He had been very active in ITAA (Information Technology Association of America) serving as the President of the Professional Services Sector for four years and serving on the organization's Board of Directors for eight years. Nathan has also been very active with his alma mater, Clarkson University. At Clarkson Nate had served on the School of Business Leadership Council for 12 years, had run ARMS U, a company run education program on campus, for six years, had been an Executive Lecturer and had supported the University with funding since graduating. In 1998 Nathan was awarded Clarkson's most prestigious alumni award, the Golden Knight. This award is presented to alumni who have distinguished themselves by service to their alma mater and have demonstrated outstanding career achievement, Mr. Konecky was also a 2001 finalist for Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year. Although Nathan's early background was in the technical disciplines, his forte had become leadership, sales and strategic vision.

Mulle's background is more working class than those of the other two, and his manner more spontaneous and less guarded.

Such an idea, according to the historian Jakob Burckhardt (1818-97), is shortsighted and misleading. This is from \\"On Fortune and Misfortune in History,\\" included in \\"German Essays on History,\\" edited by Rolf Saltzer (The German Library/Continuum, paper).    Our profound and utterly ridiculous self-seeking first regards those times as happy that are in some way akin to our nature. Further, it considers such past forces and individuals as praiseworthy on whose work our present existence and relative welfare are based. Just as if the world and its history had existed merely for our sakes! For everyone regards all times as fulfilled in his own, and cannot see his own as one of many passing waves. . . . But every individual -- we too -- exists not for his own sake, but for the sake of all the past and all the future. In the face of this great, grave whole, the claims of peoples, times and individuals to happiness and well-being, lasting or fleeting, is of very subordinate importance, for since the life of humanity is one whole, it is only to our frail powers of perception that its fluctuations in time or place are a rise and fall, fortune and misfortune.  Standing in Eden     The poet and mystic Thomas Traherne (1637-74) records how, in the aftermath of a religious vision, he stepped out into the street of an English town and found the everyday world transformed. This ecstatic account is included in \\"Profitable Wonders: Aspects of Thomas Traherne\\" by A. M. Allchin, Anne Ridler and Julie Smith (Morehouse Publishing, paper).   The Dust and Stones of the Street were as precious as GOLD. The Gates were at first the End of the World, The Green Trees when I saw them first through one of the Gates Transported and Ravished me","excerpt":"their Sweetness and unusual Beauty made my Heart to leap, and almost mad with Extasie, they were such strange and Wonderful Things; The Men! O what venerable and Reverend Creatures did the Aged seem! Immortal Cherubims! And yong men Glittering Sparkling Angels and Maids strange Seraphick Pieces of Life and Beauty! Boys and Girles Tumbling in the Street, and Playing, were moving Jewels. I knew not that they were born or should Die. . . . The Citie seemed to stand in Eden, or to be Built in Heaven. The Streets were mine, the Temple was mine, the People were mine, their Clothes and Gold and Silver was mine, as much as their Sparkling Eys fair Skins and ruddy faces. The Union of Living Things     The scientist James Lovelock offers us a startling image of our place in nature in this excerpt from \\"Healing Gaia: Practical Medicine for the Planet\\" (Harmony).   We are not managers or masters of the Earth, we are just shop stewards, workers chosen, because of our intelligence, as representatives of the others, the rest of life of our planet. Our union represents the bacteria, the fungi, and the slime molds as well as the nouveau riche fish, birds and animals and the landed establishment of noble trees and their lesser plants. Indeed all living things are members of our union and they are angry at the diabolical liberties taken with their planet and their lives by people. People should be living in union with the other members, not exploiting them and their habitats. A planetary physician observing the misery we inflict upon them and upon ourselves would support the shop steward and warn that we must learn to live with the Earth in partnership. The Living Museum     We are, David Owen realized after buying an old house, not so much owners of a home as caretakers of it, conservators for the next generation. This is from \\"The Walls Around Us: The Thinking Person's Guide to How a House Works\\" (Villard).   My house was a canvas on which other people had been painting (or, more recently, wallpapering) for more than two hundred years. . . . Every house is a work in progress. It begins in the imaginations of the people who build it and is gradually transformed, for better and for worse, by the people who occupy it down through the years, decades, centuries. To tinker with a house is to commune with the people who have lived in it before and to leave messages for those who will live in it later. Every house is a living museum of habitation, and a monument to all the lives and aspirations that have flickered within it. Holding the World Together     The novelist Leslie Marmon Silko (using the Pueblo Indians as her example) reminds us that, in many cultures, storytelling isn't simply an entertainment -- it's a way of maintaining a culture's health and unity. Her piece is included in \\"Critical Fictions: The Politics of Imaginative Writing,\\" edited by Philomena Mariani (Bay Press, 115 West Denny Way, Seattle, Wash. 98119, paper).   At Laguna Pueblo . . . many individual words have their own stories. So when one is telling a story, and one is using words to tell the story, each word that one is speaking has a story of its own, too. Often the speakers or tellers will go into these word-stories, creating an elaborate structure of stories-within-stories. . . . I'm talking about something that comes out of an experience and an understanding of the original view of creation -- that we are all part of a whole; we do not differentiate or fragment stories and experiences. In the beginning, Tseitsinako, Thought Woman, thought of all things, and all of these things are held together as one holds many things together in a single thought. So in the telling . . . the storytelling always includes the audience, the listeners. In fact, a great deal of the story is believed to be inside the listener; the storyteller's role is to draw the story out of the listeners. Noted With Pleasure"},{"year":"1943","title":"With piety and a love for camera tricks an Indian studio has sent to the Little Carnegie the history of \\"Gyandev of India,\\" a holy man of centuries ago whose life followed a pattern similar to that of most prophets. He was born in misery as the son of an ex-priest forever doomed to ostracism, he faced his numerous persecutors with sweet wisdom and homilies, he passed a few miracles in contest with a rival and he finally ascended to his apotheosis amid the laments of the faithful. This is the record pictured in an odd, static and naively incongruous film venture.For the most part of its length the film has the pace of a ritual. Its mood is dirgelike. As Gyandev the child, young Yashwant and his brothers and sisters stand about endlessly in postures of grief","excerpt":"their sweetness seems more saccharine than saintly. And when the period of the miracles draws near, \\"Gyandev of India,\\" however soberly it uses the photographic devices of \\"Topper\\" or the \\"Thief of Bagdad,\\" suddenly takes on the interest of an Indian rope trick. Holy men sit suspended in air, houses burn without being consumed, a wave of a hand freezes a mob in mid-stride, great chunks of walls suddenly detach themselves from the ground to fly through space. In Hollywood in 1943 they pass such miracles with greater alacrity and audiences enjoy them for what they are worth.Unfortunately, to an American audience, the actors seem no more than aspiring hams and the soberness with which tricks are elevated to miracles is downright gauche.

Linc and Izzy Trace are unregenerate hippies happily ensconced in a Chicago suburb","excerpt":"their three young sons, misfits with Old Testament names who prefer pencils to computers, spend all their free time digging an elaborate tunnel in the dirt cellar beneath their home. To the astonishment of their extended family, Linc and Izzy have forged an exceptionally durable bond, somehow managing to keep their children close inside a protective circle of love. This is a deeply happy household -- or so it seems. Yet external forces, from difficult relatives to interfering school officials, are beginning to assail its battlements. And as the Traces' oldest son, Obadiah, inches toward adolescence, Linc and Izzy are in for some surprises that will shake their slightly smug certainty in their own private realm. A timely fable of family and cultural values, Mr. Strong's tender novel is somewhat undermined by its too conventionally unconventional protagonists and the cliche of the counterculture as repository of wisdom and probity.

Fortunately, for the youngsters who haven't yet been exposed to a frustrated Oliver Hardy, or a whimpering Stan Laurel, or the generation who have seen them sporadically on television, this kaleidoscopic but careful selection should have the pleasurable impact of newly generated, authentic belly laughs.For any one who has viewed a great number of wonderfully idiotic capers in such items as \\"Sons of the Desert,\\" \\"Bohemian Girl,\\" \\"Swiss Miss\\" and \\"Way Out West,\\" which were tapped for this anthology, the bits and pieces are occasionally uneven and repetitious reminders of their art. A finger in the eye, a pratfall or a kick in the pants is, after all, funny when it happens, but not in successive doses.This objection is a mild one.

But their \\"Crazy World\\" is as obvious as the many doors that slam in their faces. With the exception of those who may have had this pleasure too often, this package of film fun needs no further explanation and makes a cheering Christmas gift.Also on the bill is a 38-minute assortment of cartoons and comedies derived from old film footage, many of which have been shown on TV, titled \\"Jay Ward's Intergalactic Film Festival,\\" and co-produced by Mr. Ward and Bill Scott.

Its formula is not especially novel, but the acting is unusually competent and therefore, in spite of the confusing fashion in which some of the incidents are introduced and dismissed, it is quite a fair diversion.The locale is a small Saxon town, several responsible inhabitants of which are members of a reform organization known as the \\"Association for the Elevation of Public Morals.\\" Two strait-laced members are chosen to represent the association at a Berlin convention. One of them, Peter Struwe, is interested in the picture of an actress which his wife has shown to him. As the delegate from the association he frowns (when in his home) at the inextensive attire worn by the attractive girl, but as soon as he reaches Berlin he decides to call on her in her dressing room, not knowing that she is his step-daughter or that his wife is also in the German capital. Hence, soon after his arrival in Berlin, Struwe dines and wines the fascinating musical comedy favorite.Boecklein, the other delegate, winds up in a beauty show, which is being held adjacent to the reformers' convention. Alcoholic beverages flow freely, and Boecklein awakens next morning with a terrific headache and a thirst for Adam's ale. The events of the night before are not quite clear in his mind, and he falls an easy victim to the artfulness of Struwe, who has given an indignant rival for the actress' favor the unfortunate Boecklein's card.It is not surprising that both Boecklein and Struwe are very worried when they return to their home town—Boecklein because he has used the association's cash to satisfy a demand made on him when he was in the throes of depression, and Struwe because he fears that his wife may hear of his escapade with the actress. To Struwe's consternation, Yvette, as the musical comedy star is known, turns up in town, throws her arms around Struwe's neck, sits on his knee and tells his shocked brother-in-law that she is Struwe's daughter.The final result of all this and also of an incidental youthful romance is that the \\"Association for the Elevation of Public Morals\\" loses the support of both Struwe and Boecklein, for Struwe is immensely proud when he learns from his wife that Yvette is her daughter by another marriage, who to avoid argument, Fraulein Struwe had hold her husban was in Canada.Ralph Arthur Roberts gives an amusing characterization as Struwe. Felix Bressart, who did such excelent work in \\"Die Privatsekretaerin,\\" affords plenty of fun by his portrayal of Boecklein. Anni Ahlers sings a song and gives a pleasing interpretation of Yvette. Paul Henkels, Julius Falkenstein, Gertrud Wolle and Margot Walter help out in this picture.

World famous aerial photographer William A. Garnett passed away at his home in Napa surrounded by family Saturday, August 26th. He was 89. Garnett is widely acknowledged to have defined aerial photography as an art form. Bill began his interest in photography at an early age building a darkroom with his brother Bernarr in their home in Pasadena Ca. His high school photography teacher, Earl Baird, inspired him to pursue a career as a photographer. After high school he attended Art Center School of Los Angeles. Bernarr can also be credited with kindling Bill's interest in flying using hard earned cash to buy a shared ride in the front seat of a bi-plane. Garnett's early commercial work included portraiture, architectural, sports and police photography. He was also trained as a motion picture photographer in the Army Signal Corps during World War II. On his discharge from the service, Bill hitched a ride flying home in the navigator seat of a troop transport. As he saw the beautiful landscape unfolding below him in the early morning light, he had an epiphany. He resolved to learn to fly and capture the beauty he saw to share with others. He got his pilots license on the GI Bill and began flying for pictures. Encouraged by his friends from Art Center School along with Dick McGraw and Edward Weston, he applied for and got the first of a record three Guggenheim Fellowships to further his work in 1953. Garnett loved to teach. He taught at a number of workshops with long time friend Ansel Adams in Yosemite. Garnett was hired as the Chairman of the Department of Design at UC Berkeley in 1968 where he taught photography until he retired as professor emeritus in 1984. He was also on the faculty of MIT. Many of his students have gone on to become great photographers in their own right. Garnett's work has been exhibited and sold in over 200 galleries and museums worldwide including The George Eastman House where he had his first one - man show, The Museums of Modern Art in New York and San Francisco, The Metropolitan Museum of New York, The J. Paul Getty Museum, and The Smithsonian Institution. Garnett's work has appeared in hundreds of publications including: Life and Fortune magazines, Edward Steichen's The Family of Man, Nathaniel Owings' The American Aesthetic, as well as his own books, The Extraordinary Landscape and William Garnett, Aerial Photographs. Garnett made his home on a hillside he spotted from the air in Napa California where he also tended a small vineyard. Bill is survived by his beloved wife of 64 years, Eula Beal Garnett, a talented artist in her own right. Eula had a career as a concert contralto touring the U.S. in the 40s and sang in the motion picture Concert Magic with Yehudi Menuhin in 1947.

The dour title character (Najwa Nimri) lives with her deceitful husband, Agustin (Daniel Giménez Cacho)","excerpt":"their young son; and her single, pregnant 18-year-old sister, Angela (Aida Folch). When a woman from the neighborhood who is Angela's age is found raped and murdered the same night Celia contemplates suicide, the finger seems to point toward Agustin.    But this gritty neo-noir film, included in the 15th edition of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's SPANISH CINEMA NOW series, isn't really a whodunit but a microcosm of a neighborhood where the blurring of boundaries between adults and young people leads to confusion and tragedy. Tough, sexy and unsentimental, ''Celia's Lives'' is one of the stronger entries in the series, which runs from Friday through Dec. 26 at the Walter Reade Theater.    A centerpiece of the series, which includes more than 20 films, is a retrospective, ''CITY STREETS AND SECRET PASSAGES: THE FILMS OF EDGAR NEVILLE,'' a six-movie survey of the work of a director little known outside Spain, who is considered a master storyteller and the country's first true cinematic auteur. Because he operated during the Franco era, Mr. Neville had to work around the stringent restrictions imposed on the Spanish film industry. On Dec. 10 the series will have the first of two screenings of his popular 1944 movie, ''The Tower of the Seven Hunchbacks.'' This tale, about a ring of counterfeiters operating beneath the streets of Madrid in the 19th century, can be seen as a metaphor for persistent social tensions after the Spanish Civil War.

In Nepal Jeff Greenwald discovered how opposite Eastern and Western ideas of art are. This is from \\"Shopping for Buddhas\\" (HarperCollins, paper).    The most perfect art, according to the Nepalis, stems from the re-creation of perfected formulas. No attempt need be made to realign (much less to shatter) the age-old symbolic infrastructure. . . . It's no surprise that contemporary artists have, through the ages, encountered resistance and even scorn","excerpt":"theirs is the burden of dragging the public, kicking and screaming, toward a new awareness of form and self. The art object in the West is not a final destination; it is a place marker in uncharted territory. . . .    In Nepal, traditional art is believed to already contain the highest level of understanding possible. Thangkas and dances, bronze Buddhas and ritual bells, all take their shapes from tested formulas, tried and true guidelines firmly anchored in enlightenment. The sole responsibility of the artist is to express these formulas as faithfully as possible. There is no need to shock the audience, seduce powerful gallery owners, or grope after an individual style.  The Season's Changing Song      Each season, Janet Lembke writes, has its own harmonies -- provided by a varied chorus of birds. This is from \\"Looking for Eagles: Reflections of a Classical Naturalist\\" (Lyons & Burford).     Bird-sounds change with the seasons. Autumn: common loons wail and yodel, waterfowl take flight in a slapping rush, the wings of migrant songbirds make faint drumrolls on the dark skin of night. . . . Spring: song rises filling night and day as each male volubly proclaims his right to a breeding ground where food is assured for future young or ample, species-enhancing opportunities for sex present themselves. Summer: laughing gulls on the pilings and sandbar squeal, great blue herons tear night's fabric with raucous calls, the won't-quit wrens keep hollering, but the loudest sound is no sound at all. Mute throats and closed bills protect the nest-locations and the new-hatched young as adult birds go about the gaunt work of stuffing baby craws. That Good, Great Man      Few personalities, and fewer Presidents, have so deeply impressed their contemporaries as did Abraham Lincoln. This resonant sketch is from \\"Memoirs of General W. T. Sherman,\\" edited by Charles Royster (Library of America).     I know, when I left him, that I was more than ever impressed by his kindly nature, his deep and earnest sympathy with the afflictions of the whole people, resulting from the war, and by the march of hostile armies through the South; and that his earnest desire seemed to be to end the war speedily, without more bloodshed or devastation, and to restore all the men of both sections to their homes. . . . When at rest or listening, his legs and arms seemed to hang almost lifeless, and his face was care-worn and haggard; but, the moment he began to talk, his face lightened up, his tall form, as it were, unfolded, and he was the very impersonation of good-humor and fellowship. . . . Of all the men I ever met, he seemed to possess more of the elements of greatness, combined with goodness, than any other. We Shall Overcome Someday      Sally Belfrage, in her memoir of the civil rights movement in Mississippi in 1964, recalls the solace and strength the embattled black communities in that state, and the Northern volunteers, drew from the frequent meetings, from the speeches -- and from song. This is from \\"Freedom Summer\\" (University Press of Virginia, paper).      There were more songs, and finally we stood, everyone, crossed arms, clasped hands, and sang \\"We Shall Overcome.\\" Ending every meeting of more than half a dozen with it, we sang out all fatigue and fear, each connected by this bond of hands to each other, communicating an infinite love and sadness. A few voices tried to harmonize, but in the end the one true tune welled up in them and overcame. It was not the song for harmony; it meant too much to change its shape for effect. All the verses were sung, and if there had been more to prolong it, it would have been prolonged, no matter how late, how tired they were. Finally the tune was hummed alone while someone spoke a prayer, and the verse struck up again, \\"We shall overcome,\\" with all the voice, emotion, hope, and strength that each contained. Together they were an army. Back From the Fields of Play      John Hollander wrote \\"An Old-Fashioned Song\\" in response to a request for a poem for adults who had just learned to read. It is included in \\"The Best American Poetry 1990,\\" edited by Jorie Graham (Scribners).      No more walks in the wood:  The trees have all been cut  Down, and where once they stood  Not even a wagon rut  Appears along the path  Low brush is taking over  No more walks in the wood;  This is the aftermath  Of afternoons in the clover  Fields where we once made love  Then wandered home together  Where the trees arched above,  Where we made our own weather  When branches were the sky.  Now they are gone for good,  And you, for ill, and I  Am only a passer-by.   We and the trees and the way  Back from the fields of play  Lasted as long as we could.  No more walks in the wood.

The company's heart is in the right place. The March of Dimes should realize a goodly return from the première. And only a curmudgeon would think that Fox' intentions were anything but noble in remaking this gossamer tale.But even an indulgent observer can note that \\"Daddy Long Legs\\" is a fragile and attenuated fiction. The dancing feet of \\"Daddy Long Legs\\" and the lovely object of his affections are its sturdiest attributes.Since its appearance in 1912 as a novel by Jean Webster and its subsequent reincarnations on stage and screen—in 1919 and 1931 respectively—it has not been distinguished as a weighty entertainment. But while the scenarists, Henry and Phoebe Ephron, have not added substance to the story, they have appreciated its minor charms. Though they take too long to make their point, their version is fairly light and breezy.They have deviated to some extent from the original but it is still the legend of an orphan—French, this time—who falls in love with a millionaire playboy-benefactor she has never seen. Although he is willing to sacrifice his romance because of the difference in their ages, the denouement, as always, finds them dancing cheek to cheek.Dancing, as has been noted, is the film's forte. Roland Petit has created a pip of a dream-sequence ballet, which is both imaginative and perfectly fitted to the picture's pastel colors and CinemaScope proportions. In it, Miss Caron contributes a variety of terpsichorean talents from airy Degas-like pirouettes to a low-down, sultry turn in a sleazy Hong Kong dive. Mr. Astaire, on the other hand, not only bangs out a few hot licks on the drums to illustrate his versatility but also teams, most naturally, with Miss Caron to Johnny Mercer's standard tune \\"Dream\\" and in an acrobatic new dance number titled \\"Slue-foot\\" done at a college seemingly populated exclusively by Miss Americas.Mr. Mercer also has composed \\"Something's Got to Give,\\" an item with a solid beat that seems destined for the \\"Hit Parade.\\" Ray Anthony and his band do them full justice.Some of the nonmusical members of the cast are in there trying too. Fred Clark does a neat and professional stint as Mr. Astaire's harried right-hand man","excerpt":"Thelma Ritter is equally competent as his testy secretary, and Terry Moore makes a pretty picture in her few, brief appearances as Mr. Astaire's niece and Miss Caron's college roommate.But it is the ageless and graceful Mr. Astaire and the fey Miss Caron, paired here for the first time, who give this fine romance its charm and warmth. \\"Daddy Long Legs\\" would dodder without them. ' Daddy Long Legs' Is Offered at the Roxy; Old Story, New Dances"},{"year":"1953","title":"Although maritime disasters are not unique as film fare, Twentieth Century-Fox, abetted by an obviously excellent research staff, a fine cast and a polished script, has fashioned a sometimes moving and often exciting drama from the illfated maiden voyage of the Titanic. For the newcomer of that title, which arrived at the Roxy yesterday, could have leaned heavily on mawkish sentimentality and the smug conclusions of hindsight but avoided such hackneyed procedures to dwell only on the luxury liner's trip, as based on known facts, and some of its imaginary and real passengers and crew. As a dramatization of an historic tragedy \\"Titanic\\" is adult and restrained about fiction, heroism and history.The screen play turned in by Charles Brackett (who also produced), Walter Reisch and Richard Breen, is, perhaps, a mite garrulous at first and shows strong evidences of the \\"Grand Hotel\\" format. And while the personal problems of some of the principals are as much a highlight of \\"Titanic\\" as the actual collision and sinking, it is to the writers' credit that they are presented as multi-dimensional people, who conceivably could have been aboard on that fateful April 15, 1912.Among them are Clifton Webb, dapper, social leader, who has wangled his way into the third class in a last-minute effort to stop his wife, Barbara Stanwyck, disenchanted with European spas and society, and their 18-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son, who are leaving him. There are also Brian Aherne, the bearded, veteran skipper, sedate but proud of his 60,000-ton \\"unsinkable\\" vessel and its more than 2,000 noted and nameless passengers: Richard Basehart, an unfrocked priest drowning his torment in whisky","excerpt":"Thelma Ritter, a brash and wealthy Montana mine owner; Allyn Joslyn, an overweening social climber; Robert Wagner, a Purdue athlete in love with Barbara Stanwyck's snobbish daughter and a varied complement of illustrious names and crew members.While the destiny of the Titanic is a foregone conclusion known to many, a fact that robs the film of some suspense, director Jean Negulesco and his associates have generated a mounting tension through careful use of such facts as the need for more binoculars and the fouling up of wireless messages warning of icebergs ahead. And they have captured the foreboding nature of British liner's voyage through such sights and sounds as the banshee wailing of sirens in the fog-filled harbor of Cherbourg; the keening of those horns as the vessel lists in the ice-choked waters on the Great Circle route after the 'berg ripped that terrible gash in her hull.Indicated too is the heroism of such personages as the elderly Mrs. Isador Straus, who preferred to be with her husband rather than in the safety of the lifeboats reserved for women and children, as well as the cowardice of some like Allyn Joslyn, who escaped the fate of more than 1,500 who went down with the ship. Clifton Webb, who departs, in the main, from his normal characterization, is excellent as the elegant parent who is a slave to manners and mores of the international set and who is suavely adamant in his efforts to take his children from their desperate mother. Barbara Stanwyck is a wholly believable mother anxious to preserve their love, and a twenty-year marriage but ready to sacrifice her good name and husband's respect to keep her children from the high life their father has in store. The brunette Audrey Dalton is pretty and properly haughty as the daughter, while Harper Carter is manly as Webb's adoring son.Though their personal tragedies are not as exciting as the climactic collision and its tumultuous aftermath, they are effective figures in a compelling picture.Featured in the ice stage show at the Roxy titled \\"Gay Paree,\\" are the Skating Belles and Blades, the Roxy Choraleers, Jerry Decker, Karen, Lou Folds, Gerri Richardson, Bill Peterson, Margo Moore, Melanie Magnan, the Maxwells, Fernand Leemans and Lothar Mueller.

Letters to the Editor"},{"year":"1953","title":"On a much enlarged screen, complemented by triple-horned stereophonic sound (which magnifies loudness in proportion to the size of the blow-up on the screen), Horizon Pictures' \\"Melba\\" was offered at the Capitol last night. Everyone present should know this morning that Mme. Nellie Melba, the subject of the offering, had a voice.At least they should know that Patrice Munsel, who sings and performs the role of the celebrated diva in this plush-bottomed Technicolor film, has vocal cords of fluid richness, range and capacity. For she certainly does plenty of singing in this awfully gaudy picture. And it is loud.From virtually the opening moment, when Mme. Melba is ushered before a pincushiony Queen Victoria to let loose with \\"Comin' Through the Rye,\\" it is just one song after another, operatic and otherwise, as the film flashes back and then moves forward in a free review of the opera singer's career. There is \\"Ave Maria,\\" which the lady sings sweetly with her Australian church choir","excerpt":"then a French café song, then Caro nome from \\"Rigoletto,\\" then the \\"mad song\\" from \\"Lucia di Lammermoor.\\"Thereafter follow chunks and snatches from \\"The Daughter of the Regiment,\\" \\"The Barber of Seville,\\" \\"Tocsa,\\" \\"La Bohème,\\" \\"La Traviata,\\" \\"Lohengrin\\" and \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" Scattered liberally among them are bits of practicing, a dragged-in retrospect of \\"great moments\\" at London's Covent Garden, a modern ballad by the name of \\"Dreamtime\\" (which is sung in the moonlight at Monte Carlo) and a terminal rendering of \\"On Wings of Song.\\"Even though jumbled together in an excessive, haphazard way, this massive mélange of mighty music is the meager salvation of the film. For the storybook tale of an opera singer that Harry Kurnitz has put together is a mere offense to the taste and credulity of an average numskull, and it is assembled and played with little more sense.This is one of those pictures in which the heroine always looks as though the process of cerebration is just beginning to percolate. It is one of those films in which the humor is got from such things as falling over chairs and in which the heroine, when informed that she is to sing at Covent Garden, remarks in pretty amazement, \\"Me! Nellie Melba! At Covent Garden! Me!\\"It is one of those films in which a duo of panting suitors clamor pompously after the star, but she —bless her heart — remains impervious until her old sweetheart from Australia comes along (and in the end, of course, she is ennobled when she has to choose between Love and Her Career).No wonder, then, that Miss Munsel appears to much better effect when she is singing than when she is acting this exceedingly silly and vapid role. Although Producer S. P. Eagle has dressed her in elegant gowns, which glow in the British Technicolor, and Lewis Milestone, the director, has arranged to show her off with supreme consideration, she inevitably comes out flat and gauche. On the large screen, she is just that much more gauche. It is fortunate for all that she sings so well.As the sweetheart and husband of Melba, John McCallum is tailored to a turn, and Robert Morley is solemnly obese as the inevitably predatory Oscar Hammerstein. Martita Hunt is excessively haughty as a famous voice teacher, and Alec Clunes and John Justin are silly as the Melba-toasting boys.It is hard to say why it is imagined that people who like films about opera stars would be won to any sort of admiration by a romance as sticky and banal, and overloaded with such obvious twaddle about ambition and success as this one is.Last night's première of \\"Melba\\" was a benefit for the United Cerebral Palsy of New York City, Inc. Among those who attended were Mr. and Mrs. James Farley, Mr. and Mrs. Adolph Zukor, Jane Pickens, Evelyn Keyes, Roberta Peters, John Brownlee, Lieut. Gen. E. K.

North and others to Teheran on May 28.   In an interview today on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' Mr. McFarlane said that when he arrived in Teheran and learned that none of the promised four hostages had been freed, he telephoned Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, his successor as national security adviser, in Washington and canceled the other two flights. #2 Other Planes Ready to Go Other Administration sources said Mr. McFarlane's plane, and two others, had been lined up on an Israeli airfield and were scheduled to deliver arms and supplies to Iran as part of a phased release plan.

Now another fact. Christine Todd Whitman has a proposal to weaken New Jersey's drunk driving laws. Instead of suspending their licenses, Whitman would issue some drunk drivers different colored license plants and let them drive again. But that's not all. With an epidemic of carjacking, Whitman is against mandatory sentences for carjackers. Assault weapons. Weaker drunk driving laws. No mandatory sentences for carjackers. Does Whitman even understand?\\nANALYSIS: The last words fairly drip with condecension, as if a slow student had been observed signing up for a Great Books course. As for accuracy, Mrs. Whitman's questioning of the effectiveness of some automatic sentencing laws -- along lines expressed by Attorney General Janet Reno, the Democrats own top law enforcer -- has been twisted to suggest she is soft on crime. For instance, a drunk driving conviction brings an automatic six-month suspension of driving privileges. She proposed that in special cases, as when a first-time offender's livelihood was dependent on driving, a color-coded license could be issued to allow travel between home and work. She said her concern was to preserve the individual's job and not force another family into costly social dependency, but that reasoned position is nowhere in sight here.\\nCANDIDATE: Christine Todd Whitman\\nPRODUCER: The Murphy Pintak Gautier Agency, Washington.\\nVISUAL: Mrs. Whitman, attired in a tailored red jacket, is shown in medium closeup, peering directly into the camera. She looks earnest, but she manages a smile at the conclusion of her remarks.\\nTHE SCRIPT: \\"Jim Florio thinks this election is about fooling you with untrue negative ads. I say it's about fixing New Jersey's economy. So, as Governor I am going to cut your taxes every year for the next three years, 10 per cent each year for most people, less for those in the higher brackets. Cutting taxes will create more jobs and force Trenton to reduce spending. We know what Jim Florio's taxes and spending did to our economy. Now we have to clean up the mess. I'm Christine Whitman.\\"\\nANALYSIS: The tax cut gambit can be two-edged because, in these times, even voters who rely on television ads to make their choice can be cynical about campaign promises that sound too good to be true. For this one to fly, the promise has to be buttressed by substantive argument, perhaps using Perot-like pie charts to push the product and explain how such enormous budget cuts are possible. Otherwise it could boomerang by allowing Mr. Florio to portray the plan as a windfall for Republican fat cats.

It was adapted from Charles Tenney Jackson's novel, \\"Captain Sazarac,\\" and directed by Frank Lloyd, producer of \\"The Sea Hawk.\\" The chief participants in this offering are Florence Vidor and Ricardo Cortez, and while nothing can be said against their acting, their performances will not go down in history. Miss Vidor does not seem quite suited to the type of the New Orleans belle, even though she herself comes from San Antonio, Texas. More subtle and sophisticated impersonations are in Miss Vidor's line. As for Mr. Cortez, he never impresses one as being a Jekyll and Hyde of the seas of the days of 1815. He ought to stick to modern rôles, for even when his physiognomy is decorated with an imperial, in \\"The Eagle of the Sea,\\" he is by no means an object of terror.This story is mainly concerned with a group of New Orleans society blades, whose aim is to fit out a vessel to bring Napoleon away from St. Helena. However, they do not get as far as that, but there are moderately exciting sequences dealing with piracy and the fire aboard a vessel. La Fitte is a pirate, who, on dry land, poses as Captain Sazarac. It is he who stops the runaway horses attached to Louise Lestron's carriage, and it is he who is thought to be just the person to carry out the great adventure.Mr. Lloyd has gone to no little trouble in his sea scenes, and also in depicting those of a mask ball at which Sazarac again encounters the beautiful Louise (Miss Vidor). But little does she know at the time that her hero is the very man she is opposed to as a commander of the Seraphine expedition.André Beranger, who gave a clever performance in Ernst Lubitsch's comedy, \\"So This is Paris,\\" figures in this current film as John Jarvis, an admirer of La Fitte. Jarvis is a sort of haphazard comedian who apparently arises in an intoxicated condition and, like Swinburne, greets the dawn with a foggy brain and staggering legs. What he has to do with 1815 pirates is not quite clear. He endeavors to be a poet in his way, first by picking flowers from the gutter and telling Louise that they have just been plucked and are wet with dew","excerpt":"then by declaring, as he is about to breathe his last, that he has jested with life and that death is jesting with him, for he points out that he is dying on the bed intended for an Emperor. THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1928","title":"In \\"A Ship Comes in,\\" the current film attraction at the Hippodrome, the producers take a feeble slap at circumstantial evidence and then they proceed to add to the incredibility of their story by showing an anarchist suffering mental torture after his infernal machine has dealth death and injury. It is another one of those queer mechanical scenarios over which somebody must have waxed exceedingly enthusiastic, for they succeeded in obtaining the services of such players as Louise Dresser, Rudolph Schildkraut and Robert Edeson and then William K. Howard to direct the production.This story begins in a happy fashion, but so soon as Peter Pleznitz has been in America five years and has obtained his final naturalization papers, it is decided that misery shall dog his steps. This is all arranged in a most artificial fashion, first by having an anarchist put a time bomb in a box in the place of a cake old Pleznitz was to give to the Judge who had handed him his final papers","excerpt":"then by having Pleznitz convicted of the crime of blowing up the Judge's chambers and killing a secretary, and finally by showing the anarchist attacked by mental agony when he sees clocks marking the hour of seven, at which time he had set his bomb. This torture is not enough to make the murderer confess, so he is run down by an automobile and just before he dies he tells of his guilt.Pleznitz is therefore released from prison, congratulated by the Judge, and welcomed by his wife. The philosophic old Pleznitz, who is intensely grateful to his adopted country, then asks for news of his son who went to France to fight. He is told that word has been received of the young man's death. There is a wreath around the soldier's picture and the old man looks earnestly at it and finally with a shrug of his shoulders walks into another room.Miss Dresser gives an earnest portrayal as the mother, but her actions, due to the direction, are far too slow. The same fault applies to Mr. Schildkraut's impersonation of Pleznitz. Mr. Edeson is sympathetic as the judge. As for the anarchist he is hardly the type of man who would regret his act, for he goes about it with no little cunning. The idea of such a man being affected by seeing several clocks in a jeweler's marking the fatal hour of seven, is preposterous.At the Roxy.Besides the feature picture, \\"Fazil,\\" there is at the Roxy Theatre a Movietone newsreel with several interesting subjects, including William Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, making a short address; West Point cadets in camp scenes in the Newport Casino at tea time and a baby crying.

And neither tradition is insular. Itinerant klezmer musicians absorbed something from every place they passed through, and now mix American music with an Eastern European heritage. Concert-hall flamenco, the music Mr. Castellon plays, has picked up some jazz harmonies and international influences; Mr. Benincasa used not just flamenco's venerable box-shaped drum, the cajon, but Indian tabla drums and a Middle Eastern darbuka (goblet-shaped drum) as well.

Besides a synchronized musical score there are four or five strange interludes of dialogue. Mostly a comedy, the picture has touches of melodrama, as well as incidents from the sere and yellow of two decades back.The play concerns the Mayor of a city, his son, the Mayor's employer and the daughter and grand-daughter of the employer. The Mayor and the elder woman, who were sweethearts in their youth, renew their friendship and his son pays attention to the grand-daughter, leaving the grandfather muttering gently about the vicissitudes of life. In a political campaign, one of the chief incidents, the daughter for a time runs against the Mayor, then decides to marry him instead.The main part of the picture is about the grandfather, a testy individual with a will of his own, who does not like interference with his plans. He is a good character study and as played by Claude Gillingwater is amusing and able to carry the picture over all but the highest peaks of unreality.Of the other characters, Miss Rich takes the part of the woman candidate for office and Audrey Ferris that of her daughter. Anders Randolf is the Mayor and William Collier Jr. his son.The dialogue of the picture proves very little. There is just enough for it to appear silly without adding anything.

The central figure, for instance, is not known as Arnold Rothstein, but as Murray Golden, who, of course, is a dyed-in-the-wool gambler. Although it is by no means an edifying narrative, it is a forceful, expertly fashioned film.As Golden, Spencer Tracy gives a vivid performance. It is, indeed, as thorough a characterization as has been seen on the screen. Golden is devoted to his wife, acted by Helen Twelvetrees, but gambling is his god. He revels in spectacular tricks to make others talk about him. Whether luck is with him or not, Golden's demeanor is the same. Like most of his ilk he is never satisfied with the amount of money he has made. When he has $100,000, he wants to double it and when he has done that, he wants to make $500,000.He runs a gambling place and when a man who has lost $40,000 insists that the roulette wheel is crooked, Golden, always eager to impress others, tells the irate individual that he will toss a coin to see whether he pays or not. He cuts cards for $100,000 and more and takes his losses with a sinister smile. He sits in a poker game and ends by owing many thousands of dollars. He pawns his wife's jewelry in an effort to recoup his losses, but in the end faces the point of a pistol.Golden, much as he protests his affection for his wife, neglects her. While he is watching the patrons in his gambling parlors, she sits alone in her apartment. At one point in the proceedings his enemies kidnap Mrs. Golden","excerpt":"then Golden shows nothing matters so long as he can have her back. But he does resolve to even up matters with those to whom he paid the ransom. When he seeks vengeance, however, he becomes more and more reckless.Miss Twelvetrees gives a most sympathetic and believable portrait of Golden's worried wife, who eventually divorces him and decides to marry another man. Alice Faye appears as Peggy Warren, a blonde who is killed while riding in an automobile with Golden. Miss Faye does very well by her rôle. Robert Gleckler is excellent as Al Mositer, Golden's bitterest enemy. Hobart Cavanaugh is efficient as the gambler's somewhat spineless friend.On the surrounding program there are Walt Disney's \\"Silly Symphony\\" entitled \\"Funny Little Bunnies,\\" and another short film called \\"Sealing Wax.\\" The stage program consists of a Fanchon and Marco production known as \\"The Fleet's In,\\" with Jack Pepper, Jeanne Devereaux, Pettet and Douglas, the Gretonas, Don Ford, Wesley Eddy and the Gae Foster dancers.

If memory serves, Reginald Denny was once a robust survivor of a similar epidemic and, without doubt, there must have been equally burly \\"last men\\" before him. But Senhor Roulien is a tenor and, in this film, an annoyingly popular ladies' man. One cannot help sympathizing with matronly Emma Dunn when she complains:\\"Of all the men in the world, he would be the only one left.\\"Carlos (Senhor Roulien) owes his life to being jilted. To punish the girl, he takes off on a transpacific flight and is forced down on an otherwise uninhabited island in mid-ocean.

In it the French player, Henry Garat, who won favor in the English version of \\"Congress Dances,\\" makes his first appearance in a Hollywood production. His team-mate is none other than the popular Janet Gaynor, who this time has the opportunity to play the rôle of a Princess of a mythical kingdom.Many of the clever ideas in the original production have been copied in this version and the music is credited to both Werner Richard Heymann and Richard A. Whiting. It is staged admirably and the gentle satirical touches found favor with an audience at its first showing at the Radio City Music Hall yesterday.Another player who does much to enhance the worth of this picture is C. Aubrey Smith, who portrays a Prime Minister of the socalled Hipsburgy-Legstadt, supposed to be somewhere between Munich and Vienna. Mr. Smith wears a beard and much of the time he, as Von Heynitz, is quite worried over the Princess's sudden infatuation for a delicatessen dealer.During an early episode one observes the care taken by the array of chefs in cooking the King's breakfast. This ruler keeps very much to himself and his appearance at the close of the proceedings is somewhat of a surprise. When he is prepared to receive the Prime Minister he signals by a bugle arrangement over the door of his private suite. The King's food is tasted by von Heynitz before it is taken into the royal suite.All sorts of cinematic liberties are taken in this musical romance. The Princess's slippers dance after she goes to bed, and her bed also begins to sway to the music. The Princess is very happy, for she has fallen in love with a handsome young man named Karl whom she met at a servants' dancing party. Karl, who is really a dashing Lieutenant, tells the Princess that he is a delicatessen dealer and she pretends that she is employed tin a manicure parlor.There is plenty of wholesome amusement when the Princess discovers that Karl is an officer. One day she insists on the Prime Minister promoting him to be a Captain","excerpt":"then he is made a Major, a Lieutenant Colonel, and finally von Heynitz announces that the young officer is a General.The dainty Princess keeps Karl guessing, for it is not until the picture is close to its end that Karl learns that the pretty manicurist and the much-talked-of Princess are one and the same. The German edition of this refreshing combination of melody, fun and romance was presented here at the Cosmopolitan in 1931.Miss Gaynor does fairly well by her rôle and she looks petite and charming. Her voice is rather childish in tone, which is unusual with a Princess. M. Garat is ingratiating as Karl. So far as the acting of the King is concerned, that is best left for the spectator to judge.On the Stage.No loud huzzahs in praise of the stage presentation at the Music Hall will feature this subordinate paragraph this morning.

The works were priced at $:4,000 and $:5,000 each, and Prue O'Day, an owner of the gallery, said Mr. Saatchi spent $:20,000, or about $29,000. Mr. Saatchi first saw Mr. Callery's work a month before, at a new artist's space near King's Cross in London called Cubitt Street Studios, where he bought an abstract landscape painting.   Such sprees are nothing new for Mr. Saatchi. But just as fast as he buys many works by a single artist, he has been known to sell them, sending prices on a rapid roller-coaster ride. This fickle behavior is a subject of great interest to gallery owners, artists, auction-house experts and collectors, who keep close tabs on Mr. Saatchi's dealings because he has been known to inflate an artist's reputation and then deflate it in short order, all single-handed.

To him it meant nothing that the villain should win Berenice's daughter, and he was not exactly perturbed when Berenice began to smile upon the villain so as to save her ungrateful daughter. Sandy Hair did, however, lean forward with his hand on his chin, like a deaf man of 80 odd, when he saw the sea lashing a sunny shore, and he remained quite still during those few frames depicting Janet, the daughter, taking a swimming lesson. In the story she seems to take the swimming lesson so as to show that she is blessed with a good figure, but that passed by Sandy Hair's notice. He evidently did like the splashing water, but he was bored when Berenice says reproachfully to Janet:\\"Janet, you've been drinking.\\"Prior to that Sandy Hair perked up a bit when he noticed that the villain had a combination flask and cigarette case. But things, according to Sandy Hair's demeanor, went from bad to worse, until suddenly he discovered a source of interest that bad nothing whatever to do with the film. It was the fact that, so far as he could see, every other seat but his had a light near the carpet. He struggled to find where his light was, and in doing so nearly toppled off the seat. This kept him mentally alert for more than a chapter and when he looked up next he heard a strong voiced title-reader announcing:\\"They're crying, so they must be perfectly happy.\\"This caption, which was Greek to Sandy Hair, was accompanied by a scene of Berenice and Tom Richards looking through a key hole.

The Mystery of Depardieu: A Gentle Heart in a Boxer's Body"},{"year":"1928","title":"Up to a closing chapter in the latest pictorial transcription of \\"Alias Jimmy Valentine,\\" the irrepressible William Haines controls matters and therefore the film, which filled the screen at the Astor Theatre last night, frequently descends to buffoonery. In this instance the light-hearted Mr. Haines is funny in a way and so is the story. There are incidents that obviously tickle the audience, but the latter audible episodes, those devoted to something like the original story, contain the meat of the whole offering. And this in a large measure is due to the appearance of Lionel Barrymore, who, as if he had cast a magic spell over the picture, brings even Mr. Haines down to earth.Mr. Barrymore, as he did in the picturization of \\"The Lion and the Mouse,\\" eloquently proves himself a master of diction who knows no fear of the microphone and his lines in this talking chapter once again demonstrated the superiority of a trained stage actor over ordinary screen players.In this version of the Paul Armstrong play that was itself inspired by O. Henry's story, \\"A Retrieved Reformation,\\" Mr. Barrymore plays Detective Doyle and it is his artistry when questioning Valentine, who is insisting that he is Lee Randolph, that causes one to come away with a far better opinion of this subject than if it had finished with the love song being rendered by some unseen persons as Rose is unwittingly swaying Valentine to go straight.There are moments in this adventure that are not far from being sacrilegious. Valentine and his colleagues in crime, Swede and Avery, enter a church with Rose and her family and it is while the congregation is singing a hymn that Avery can't resist snatching a woman's purse. Avery is startled a moment later by hearing the minister proclaim the text, \\"A thief has entered the house,\\" which, following a gesture from Valentine, prompts him to return the stolen property.During some passages one bemoans the fact that the comedy is of such a low variety. Then the action may suddenly take a leap to something more natural, after which one may be tr???ed to the love theme song with a scene in which the affectionate couple, Valentine and Rose, are just visible through a wealth of apple blossoms.After the good-looking Valentine decides to take the narrow path, old Avery, incidentally capitally played by Tully Marshall, goes out to do a solo job, and Valentine and the Swede suspect that something has happened to the old man when they hear a revolver shot. They hasten to a factory, the payroll of which had attracted the trio on entering the town, and discover Avery in the centre of a crowd.

Attempts are constantly made to rediscover neglected figures and trace new strands of influence. In recent years, there have been waves of advocacy: for the unappreciated American symphonists of the 1940's, the pioneering composers of the 1890's, the eccentric figures who pepper the 20th-century avant-garde. But there is hardly a compositional canon to speak of, let alone a coherent interpretation of the past.   Certain figures keep reappearing, however, and on Tuesday night at St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University, a superb recital by the Perspectives Ensemble again turned the spotlight on Charles Tomlinson Griffes. He died of pneumonia in 1920, a 35-year-old music teacher in an upstate New York boarding school with just 13 years of composition behind him. But he is often cited as one of the most original American composers. (\\"First class all through,\\" Virgil Thomson wrote.) This recital, with its broad sampling of works, left the impression that Griffes (pronounced GRIFF-iss) shared an approach that has helped define American music: first he had to custom design his own musical tradition","excerpt":"then he tried to transcend it.

By the time I've threatened for the zillionth time that I'm throwing away all my ice scrapers, packing and heading straight for Arizona, I know I'm desperate.   Then spring comes. My body begins to defrost from winter's cold - fingers get un-numbed and eyes start to notice buds and blooming flowers in a myriad of colors amid a sea of green. I try to remember when I last saw a rainbow.   It's summer and time for back to nature. I begin a renewed communication with the physical world and myself. I gain strength in the brilliant and healing warmth of the sun, listen to birds, and sometimes witness a glorious thunderstorm.   An image comes to mind when I think of the sun. I see a seed being pressed into fertile soil, dying to the shape and form it's been in","excerpt":"then I see the sun beating down and, in time, a shoot breaks free of the ground, pushing up, unfolding to new life. How is it possible to gain strength from the sun? Get up early to look on it as a soft, pink and orange circle rising out of a blue sky. This show is just for me, I like to think, as it slowly bursts forth with light. Do you see it? The atmosphere begins to warm and so does my body. The rigid melts into the spontaneous. Hours later, the sun is in full blaze. It's hot. It gets hotter. I love it. All winter I've waited for this. Nothing seems impossible.   Sometimes the air gets heavy and still. Clouds overshadow the sun in a dense formation. It's suddenly dark - all the ingredients have been collected for a thunderstorm.   The best thunderstorms occur when I'm safely in the house, preferably showered and clad in cuddly pajamas, a cup of tea in hand - and zappo! a bolt jolts me right out of my slippers. I love sitting by the window watching lightning illuminate the sky like bright white veins. Light is quicker, so I wait the few seconds before the crashing sound of thunder. I sit in awe rooted to my spot by the magnitude of electrical charge before me. It gets quiet, peaceful. Then comes the sweet smell of the air when it mixes with rain and humidity - the only time I'm willing to sacrifice getting the dreaded frizzy hair.   It is this calm after a storm suggestive of a wild, tropic atmosphere that is complemented by the sound of birds. What a marvel is the music of birds in summer. Do you hear them? The most beautiful songs come from big and little birds, they range from short peeps to long, lusty trills that pierce the silence with their cadence.   I do not find the woodpecker rude when he makes his persistent knock-knock-knock on a telephone pole. Because he is not into giving up, I respect his right to make a racket. There is one bird I see almost every day with a brown cape of feathers and an orange belly who must be feeding a large family because it eats everything I give it and comes back for more.   All those birds remind me of freedom in nature in the way they sing and fly free, sometimes alone and other times respectfully conforming to a squadron traveling together. They hop along my driveway, they eat my bread, they are a joy of God's creation.   Thunder and lightning only temporarily drown out the birds' spirited sounds. Thunder and lightning are the force that represents responsibility that works with freedom. There is something stronger than me that causes booms in the sky. It intrudes upon me with its shocking light that says, 'Attention! Let people know where you stand\\"; the thunderous crack that speaks of a power beyond human control that makes seeds into plants, brings love in strength and then, when the rains come, brings water to cleanse, feed the thirsty soil, and adorn leaves with jewels of beaded raindrops. It is a celebration of sight and sound that touches my heart.   On Long Island, our delicate balance of nature is sometimes taken for granted, for we get more than our quota of rain (and have the canceled picnics and ball games to prove it). But when brush fires become unbearable, the strong smell of burning invading nose, head, and lungs, the thought of so many beautiful trees reduced to ash, it is enough. Glorious lightning and thunder will come in relief as sure as I know God is present in nature and here shepherding me in the storms of my life. After, with the quiet, will emerge those birds, eager to get at worms thrust up from the soggy earth, to continue their life cycle, bring their music and give me hope. If I'm lucky I'll look up and catch a full spectrum of color, an elusive rainbow.

Illustrated. 204 pp. (Norton, $65.) It took the photographer Hiroji Kubota three years to get permission to photograph in China and seven years and 200,000 clicks of the shutter to collect this fine gathering of 186 color photographs. The pictures reveal China from the time when the current open-door policy was only a narrow slit to the now cavernous entrance provided the West, especially the United States. When historians look back to what may prove to be the most significant change of a national outlook in this century, Mr. Kubota's images will show China just crossing the threshold, just inviting the West in, timidly peeking out. He assigned himself all of China - one billion people, 3.7 million square miles and 55 minority nationalities. The book is especially full of China's minorities; at times the reader forgets the overwhelming majority presence of the Han Chinese, so rich are the photographs of the Kazakhs, the Uighurs, the Tibetans, the Mongolians.

Well, to take an example, though I've cut my own hair for 30 years, this spring for the first time I put the trimmings out on the lawn for the various birds that search for hair to weave into their nests. Using an audio tape, I've learned to identify many more bird calls than I knew at 50, and 10 times as many as when I was 20. I'm up before 6 and when the dawn's chorus ceases I play other music, knitting an aural nest of Bach for organ, Beethoven for piano, Louis Armstrong, \\"My Fair Lady,\\" Edith Piaf, \\"Peter Grimes,\\" each day's menu impromptu (my dogs bark sharply when the whale songs come on) -- seldom much that I didn't listen to decades ago, but I pay more attention because after a spell of eye trouble, music and visual color seem central now.   I'm more moderate, gentler in judgment, less self-conscious, though quite cranky, yet recognizing other people's right to be cranky too. For the sake of harmony I take more for granted and skim over more. I'm still astonished, ineradicably so, by my generation's failure to push past token gestures to change the world for the good and to be less greedy and violence-prone than the generations before. But money is old-hat to me, unexciting, although essential, neither of which it seemed in the past. I used to despise money, which could have made my old age frightening, except that writers do not retire and my earning power has increased. Sex has become like driving a car with 95,000 miles on it. You don't go fast or dwell on the details but you do get there.   I know more about children, food, answering mail, theories of health, conversational tact, variants and staples of religious thought, highlights of art, and where I might like to be if a helicopter pilot were willing to lift me anywhere in the world. When I walk in the woods I carry a stick to part the brush and lend me footing in crossing a stream, but this only reminds me of African spearmen I have hiked with and makes me feel young. Beyond the memories I have, the balance and heft of a stick in my hand is primeval, as young as mankind can get.   It's a shorter journey back to my early teens, where I'll dawdle a while with Nat King Cole. I've got the 1949 World Series on tape, Yankees versus Dodgers, the civilized banter of Red Barber and Mel Allen and the suspenseful feats of Tommy Henrich, Yogi Berra, Jackie Robinson, Preacher Roe. When I need to leave the room, I re-experience that moment of panic that I'll miss DiMaggio's next at-bat -- and can remember the silent tears filling my eyes when the Yankees would lose a game. I had a friend who grew equally teary on behalf of the Red Sox, so I suggested we call a truce and quit teasing each other about our grief, which just made it worse. But he said no, that wouldn't be baseball.   I'm still loath to believe he was right, yet the evidence sits right here on the table. Besides the violin partitas and \\"Goldberg\\" Variations that occupy some of the best of my days, I've acquired a radio scanner that plugs me into the muffled shouts of out-of-breath firemen, ambulance attendants, sheriff's deputies chasing a thief, state police zeroing in on a bank robber's flight. Presumably these emergencies would hold no interest for me if gloating over another person's disappointment when his team loses were not also part of the appeal of sports.   There's malice in us till we die. I've never met an elderly person fit in his faculties who was completely benign. But the obverse of that is the incongruous picture we keep of ourselves as remaining forever around the age of 18. I'm startled whenever I look at my body, yet when I first strip to swim in a pond near my home, I'm nonchalant in the fashion of a quite comely youth. (So what if someone shows up? They may find me worth a glance.) In our minds lives the remnant mischief of a kid, and not only the cruel, envious, jittery goblin who will inhabit us until we drop, but a kind spirit who feels sorry for lobsters after decades of eating them, who winces at hollering voices if one is an adult's and the other a child's, and wants to write big checks for famine relief.   Though closer to death, I am more reconciled, having seen my father, my ex-wife and four or five intimate friends die rather slowly -- events that were, of course, sadly cryptic but because of painkillers were no longer a terrifying mystery, scalding like hellfire, as they would have been hundreds of years ago, when hellfire was a buzzword. I don't expect to rejoin or \\"miss\\" these people in the hereafter, yet, having spent a great deal of my personal and professional life riding a surf of wind-song, wolf howls, elephants snuffling, trees soughing, grasshoppers buzzing, frogs croaking, I do think I'll mix in somehow with all of the above, the wine of human nature blending with the milk of outdoor nature in a mulligatawny soup of soil, rainwater and pondy chemicals, with infinite possibilities once again.   Reincarnation or a heavenly life is the ultimate comfort offered by every religion I am familiar with, and I don't want to be me for more than another 20 years anyway. Neither eternal oblivion nor me, but something else. Maybe moss. One could do worse. Moss, if left alone, seems to live about as long as people do","excerpt":"then it goes back to mulligatawny soup again. Having witnessed the Sudanese famine in 1993, I expect to see other scarifying tragedies that will ease me into a grateful grave. But during my 61st year I also saw India on a first visit, and Antarctica -- tigers and ice.   As Renaissance men of a new kind, we should feast our eyes. Instead, we fret about civilization. Civilization is with us to stay. I worry more about the toads' and the tree frogs' songs. I want that stew to be yeasty with tadpole, muskrat and otter bones, loons' bills, lady-slippers, skunk cabbage, jack-in-the-pulpits and moose and bear pies, not just an ossuary of human relics. Otherwise my moss is not going to thrive.

But for movie distributors and marketers, who must jockey for the best opening days and manufacture buzz among those most likely to show up on those days, this summer has been in play for months -- in some cases, even years. From the start of production to the annual exhibitor conventions to the publicity campaigns, the studios are in a war for opening-day supremacy. Based on conversations with studio executives, this chronology follows the strategic maneuvering that has been going on since June 30, 2003, when ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith'' began principal photography.    June 30, 2003 -- Competitors check the calendar: a ''Star Wars'' epic usually takes two years to complete, and recent installments have opened the third weekend in May. Let the games begin.    Aug. 20, 2003 -- ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith'' returns to the 20th Century Fox schedule, with a November start date, even after losing first Nicole Kidman (to a scheduling conflict) and then Brad Pitt. The reason? Angelina Jolie has committed to ''Mrs.,'' and Pitt is back on board to play ''Mr.'' Also this month: DreamWorks begins animating ''Madagascar,'' a computer-generated feature about shipwrecked zoo animals.    Oct. 14, 2003 -- Columbia announces that Josh Lucas will star in ''Stealth,'' directed by Rob Cohen, with production beginning early in 2004. Already tentatively scheduled to open Memorial Day weekend of 2005, it's about stealth fighter pilots and technology run amok. The marketing begins immediately, according to Geoffrey Ammer, president for worldwide marketing at Sony's Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group. Looking for ''an iconic image'' for the print advertising, they come up with a shot of three dashing pilots -- Mr. Lucas, Jessica Biel and Jamie Foxx -- striding toward the viewer with a stealth fighter looming behind them.    December 2003 -- ''Madagascar'' chooses a release date -- in industry-speak, ''plants the flag'': Memorial Day weekend 2005.    January 2004 -- Sony now claims a different date, July 29, 2005, for ''Stealth.''    Feb. 17, 2004 -- ''The Longest Yard,'' a remake of the 1974 football-in-prison movie, is set for production July 20, with Paramount distributing domestically and Sony internationally. It will star Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Snoop Dogg, other current rappers, former N.F.L. players and, eventually, Burt Reynolds, who starred in the original. Will they be marketing the cast, or are they casting for the market? Both.    April 5, 2004 -- Lucasfilm announces the ''Star Wars III'' release date: May 19, 2005. Fox, which is its distributor, now must position its own ''Fantastic Four,'' a live-action adaptation of the Marvel comic book series. It chooses July 1 --a long holiday weekend means a bigger opening. A film shown on more than 3,000 screens earns an average of 31.6 percent of its total domestic box office during its first weekend, and a big opening increases ''must-see'' urgency for the coming weeks. Paramount will soon claim Memorial Day for ''The Longest Yard,'' and with a different target audience it may thrive opposite ''Madagascar.'' But Chris Rock plays one of the animals in ''Madagascar'' -- in ''Longest Yard,'' he will be competing against his own voice.    July 22-25, 2004 -- Comic-Con International, in San Diego, the major event of the year for comic book and fantasy aficionados. Movie marketers know they can use its passionate audience of Internet-savvy fans to start buzz -- hopefully positive -- about coming films. Fox shows off the director and the newly announced cast of ''Fantastic Four,'' while Warner Brothers is quickly dissed online for not providing a sneak peek of ''Batman Begins,'' which is already in production. Two weeks later, the director, Christopher Nolan, will make a surprise appearance at another convention, Wizard World Chicago, and show two minutes of the film.    Aug. 11, 2004 -- ''Mission: Impossible 3,'' starring Tom Cruise, was originally scheduled for May 2004","excerpt":"then it was postponed, first to May 2005, then to June 29, 2005 -- all before losing its director over ''creative differences'' and without being scheduled for production. Now Paramount and DreamWorks greenlight a Steven Spielberg remake of the classic H.G. Wells novel ''War of the Worlds,'' starring -- yes, Tom Cruise. ''Mission'' is pushed back indefinitely, and ''War of the Worlds'' plants the flag on June 29, 2005. ''Fantastic Four'' and ''War of the Worlds'' are both high-concept films with presold titles, but going head to head on the Fourth of July weekend could mean disappointing box-office revenue. Will someone in this game of chicken swerve?    Aug. 23, 2004 -- With the start of production on ''Fantastic Four,'' publicity ratchets up. James N. Gianopulos, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, described it as a gradual process: ''revealing a film's elements as you'd peel an onion.'' To generate -- and control -- publicity, films typically limit on-set access to favored outlets, particularly those with vast audiences, like ''Entertainment Tonight'' or ''Access Hollywood.'' Fox, however, invites a large contingent of reporters to the set of ''Fantastic Four'' midproduction, to demonstrate Michael Chiklis's daily transformation into the Thing.    Nov. 7, 2004 -- After a mere 12 weeks of preproduction, ''War of the Worlds'' -- a complex special-effects film -- begins shooting with less than half the lead time of ''Star Wars III.''    Nov. 19, 2004 -- Sony sends out the teaser trailer for ''Bewitched,'' starring Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell, in time for exhibitors to attach it to Paramount/Nickelodeon's ''SpongeBob SquarePants Movie.'' At 30 to 45 seconds, instead of a standard trailer's two and a half minutes, a teaser introduces the film's main concept and announces the release season or date. ''On branded properties, an early impression is important,'' said Jeff Blake, vice chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment. ''But with special effects films, it's hard.'' Mr. Ammer said that the trailer is the most important element of movie advertising, because ''the audience is 100 percent moviegoers.'' The poster, called the one-sheet, goes to theaters at the same time as the trailer.    Dec. 9, 2004 -- The teaser-trailer for ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' (Warner Brothers, July 15) has its premiere on MTV's ''TRL.''    Jan. 7, 2005 -- Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston separate, after months of tabloid Pitt-Jolie rumors from the set of ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith.'' Any overt exploitation of the offstage drama for publicity purposes, however, could result in ''blowback,'' unintended negative consequences that contradict the old adage that any publicity is good publicity.    Feb. 6, 2005 -- Super Bowl Sunday. The studios pay $2.4 million each for 30-second ads for ''The Longest Yard'' (Paramount, May 27); ''Batman Begins'' (Warner Brothers, June 15); and ''War of the Worlds'' (Paramount, June 29).    Feb. 7, 2005 -- Paramount gets some quick bang for its big Super Bowl bucks: Fox blinks and reschedules ''Fantastic Four'' for July 8, out of direct competition with the opening of ''War of the Worlds,'' but up against ''Bewitched.'' In its new position, ''Fantastic Four'' could cut into the second-weekend grosses for ''War.''    Week of March 6, 2005 -- Sony moves ''Bewitched'' out of the cluttered July 8 weekend to June 24. Fox attaches the trailer of ''Star Wars III'' to its big spring animated movie, ''Robots,'' and also shows the full-length trailer on its television hit ''The O. C.'' Mr. Blake, of Sony, said, ''You like to attach a trailer to one of your own films, and get exhibitors to attach it to your competitors' films.'' Also this week, DreamWorks screens portions of ''Madagascar'' for press and exhibitors, getting a jump on the promotional clutter of the following week's ShoWest convention -- which will still include a special ceremony honoring Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks. (See accompanying article.)    Week of March 21, 2005 -- The chess moves continue: Paramount moves its ''Bad News Bears'' remake to July 22 from June 10, where it would have pitted Billy Bob Thornton against his ex-wife, Ms. Jolie.    April 2, 2005 -- A new line of Star Wars III toys joins the recently released Darth Tater. DreamWorks is on the case too: Ben Stiller, one of the ''Madagascar'' voices, is host of Nickelodeon's ''Kids' Choice Awards.'' Johnny Depp, star of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,'' is honored, Nick style, by being slimed.    April 7, 2005 -- Paramount begins weekly press screenings of ''The Longest Yard'' in New York and Los Angeles, including one for the sports press covering the N.F.L. draft. Viewers of the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament in March have seen commercials, and so will viewers of the N.B.A. finals. The rapper Nelly appears in the film, produced the soundtrack and performs the lead single -- bait for fans of MTV, which is, like Paramount, a Viacom company.    April 8, 2005 -- Sony takes over MGM and immediately moves MGM's ''Pink Panther,'' starring Steve Martin and Kevin Kline, from September to Aug. 5, a week ahead of its own ''Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,'' meant to offer adolescent males a last blast of humor before school resumes. The Aug. 5 competition is ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' (Warner Brothers), which itself has been moved from June 24, and ''Doom'' (Universal), based on the video game. Universal soon pushes ''Doom'' to Oct. 21.    April 21-24, 2005 -- Star Wars Celebration III fan convention, in Indianapolis. George Lucas appears, along with costumed fans living their epic dream, just in time to ramp up ''Star Wars'' awareness before the opening.    May 2005 -- Sweeps month on television. Look for movie ads during season finales and other highly promoted shows. Warner Brothers will broadcast eight minutes of ''Batman Begins'' on WB during ''Smallville.'' And what's this? George Lucas again, appearing this time in an episode of Fox's series ''The O.C.''    Days before May 19 -- ''Star Wars'' fans will line up and camp overnight across the country, while at the Cannes Film Festival, ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith'' will be screened out of competition. George Lucas can again be counted on to be there.    Coming Months -- Lavish premieres -- and the attendant print and television coverage -- will precede the openings of high-profile films.    Future Years -- The biggest weekends of 2006 and 2007 have already been claimed by the studios. Expect changes.    Wooing the Toughest Crowd: The Movie-Theater Owners      THE single most important marketing tool for summer movies is ShoWest, the annual trade show that draws movie-theater owners from around the world to Las Vegas.     Held this year from March 14 through 17, ShoWest is as much carnival as trade show. Movie distributors spend lavishly on hoopla -- parties, stars and booze -- in the hope that theater owners will temporarily forget that their financial interests and those of the studios are not identical. Theaters rent films for certain guaranteed periods in exchange for a share of the total ticket sales. On opening weekend -- and perhaps the second weekend of a big picture -- the split is 70 percent to the distributor and 30 percent to the exhibitor.     The studio's share declines by 10 percent each week: first to 60 percent, then to 50 and 40, until it levels out at 30 to 35 percent for as long as the theater keeps the film. The studio wants a film to open huge, even if it doesn't last long. Theaters, which earn much of their revenue from concession sales, prefer movies that will run all summer to full houses, with the theater ultimately taking 65 percent of ticket sales.    The sales pitches are endlessly inventive. Paramount's booth on the trade-show floor is a one-and-a-half-story house. An LCD screen in the living room promotes ''Elizabethtown,'' a coming-of-age romance directed by Cameron Crowe. Paramount has had it scheduled for July 29, in the midst of the summer crush and up against ''Stealth''; now it is pushed back to October. A late scheduling change sometimes means that there are problems, but the ''Elizabethtown'' maneuver, according to Robert G. Friedman, Paramount's chief operating officer, is meant ''to move it closer to awards season.'' Next, living-room visitors are hurried down into the basement of the house by a frantic actor waving a flashlight and talking about danger. The basement's screen presents Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg pitching ''War of the Worlds'' (June 29), along with an impressive sneak peek at the film's story and special effects.    For the ShoWest Schmooze-a-Rama buffet lunch, competing studios have installed a dozen or so ''experiential branding'' setups in the ballroom. Priority goes to Sony's ''Stealth,'' with a mock-up of the nose section of a stealth fighter against a backdrop painted with the wings. Exhibitors can don fighter-pilot shirts for a photograph that mimics the poster. A half-dozen other photo-ops mean that the exhibitors' vacation albums will be filled with snapshots meant to remind them of coming films.    The convention crowds, who seem preoccupied with food, photo-ops and gift bags of promotional items, are nevertheless scrutinizing the product reels with a practiced, professional sense of what will play in, for example, Sheboygan, Wis. There, the Marcus chain owns the only theater in the county. The manager of its 13 screens, Dennis Udovich, said, ''The smaller indie films never play there unless they've been successful elsewhere, like 'Napoleon Dynamite.''' Mr. Udovich said that ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith'' (Fox, June 10) ''could do some business. It looks cute. There's chemistry'' between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.    The Sony show-and-tell evening culminates in an hourlong sneak peek at ''Stealth.'' The filmmakers have spent six weeks preparing an excerpt -- high-tech, high-energy and high-explosive -- to persuade exhibitors to buy a film without a presold brand name. Sony follows the ''Stealth'' screening with a flashy 70's-inspired disco extravaganza.     The Fox presentation is invaded by the ''Star Wars'' Imperial Army and Darth Vader, who introduces George Lucas, followed by eight minutes of the new feature. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, looking both fabulous and uncomfortable, present a clip from ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith,'' about married assassins ordered to kill each other.     ShoWest concludes with an awards ceremony. Everyone honored -- is this a surprise? -- has a film coming up.

Will Durant discussed this in the first volume of \\"The Story of Civilization.\\" Aryans defined a caste system based on \\"verma\\" or color.    Native Indians, mainly Dravanian and Najas, adopted the caste system with a modification based on profession. This professional caste system was \\"jati,\\" or by birth.    \\"The man who is good by birth becomes low by low association, but who is low by birth can't become high by high association\\" is the principle described in Manu, a Hindu scripture.   Pakistanis share the same cultural roots. In Pakistan the caste system is based on \\"jati,\\" or birth. Castes are based on the profession in the community. I was told the following caste order by my grandmother:    Zamindar, or landowner, is the highest","excerpt":"then lohar-thrukkhan, or blacksmith-carpenter; then poly, or weaver; mochi, or cobbler; meerasi-naie, or entertainer-barber. In Pakistan, the equivalents of Hindu untouchables are chammar, chura and bhangi, or janitor. These people have separate plates and cups in all employee cafeterias. They are mainly Christian, although some are Hindus and Muslims.   The caste system, in its feudal origins, reflected the importance of professions and occupations for agricultural output. Blacksmith-carpenters were important because they produced tools for agriculture, thus their high status. Pakistan is predominantly an underdeveloped agricultural society. While the caste system has religious approval under Hinduism, it has no future in an industrializing Muslim society. In an industrial era, castes are replaced by classes.   The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has a clause for castes under the article \\"Schedule Castes.\\" Castes are defined by birth, even if you change your profession from cobbler to surgeon.    To get rid of this stigma, a lot of so-called low-caste people migrate to cities, and there they change their castes. Usually, they try to link their ancestry to the prophet Mohammed (in Pakistan, ancestry is determined by male history), although the prophet Mohammed had no son to continue his life.   I received many letters from Pakistan in fall 1989 about a lohar, or blacksmith, who was riddled with more than 80 AK-47 bullets in Taien village in the Poonch District of Azad Kashmir because he married a higher caste woman. Later, the woman was also killed because society would not accept her. I believe that Lubna Suhail must know well about such a caste system in Pakistan. It is common practice in Pakistan to hide or deny bad things from foreigners because they bring a bad name to the prestige of the country.   But the suffering that is based on the caste system is worse than the bad name.

It is a process the author uses quite deliberately to illustrate the process of pain he is trying to record.\\"Sing Ulysses, sing your travels,\\" Mr. Mekas's voice begins, and he goes on to speak of \\"a man who never wanted to leave his home . . . who was thrown into the world.\\" The movie, from start to finish, is about the damage done by exile; only in the first part it is shown directly, and thereafter, indirectly.It is the first part that has most of the power: it is an infinitely moving and perceptive record of the exile of a whole community. Mr. Mekas, at the time fully a part of this community, records the meals, the weddings, the Sunday outings. He records the pain of the refugee doctors, lawyers, poets, politicians who suddenly find themselves transplanted as truck drivers, messengers and factory hands.They meet, they form committees, they dress up for a picnic in the country at the end of which they sit, in rows of garden chairs, to hear a former Cabinet minister talk about the situation. They take all the steps, these educated and decent people, that they have taken all their lives; but suddenly, in the hard soil of a new country, they leave no footprints. The fact that Mr. Mekas used a silent camera strengthens the image of ghosts who gesture, pace, talk and make no sound.And then Jonas, and his brother Adolfas, seeing nothing ahead but a future of Lithuania Day dances, leave this futile reality, move to Manhattan and, as the author puts it, \\"start from scratch.\\"Even a futile reality is not so easily replaced. They write, they take odd jobs, they work on film, they make friends in the avant-garde. But there is no center. Mr. Mekas follows and films—sometimes quite beautifully—all the vigils and peace marches of the late 1950's. (How peaceful the demonstrators look from this side of the late 60's; how gentle the police look.) He makes experimental films, makes filmed haikus in the snow.It is pretty, some of it, but dated and pretentious by now. With the novelty long past, the caperings of Mr. Mekas and his friends remind us of children who protest the lack of anything to do by posturing and grimacing. It is a frenetic hopefulness mustered against a real emptiness of exile, and the exile is not just for two Lithuanian brothers from Brooklyn but for their American contemporaries as well.We get the message, but it does not touch us as the message in the first part does. A dying reality is material for a splendid film; a living emptiness hardly ever is.

The yellow-flowered Primula vulgaris is the most usual \\"English primrose,\\" but it has been bred to include other colors, particularly red and blue shades.

For a clue to the extent of the clan, one of the best sources for seed is Far North Gardens, 16785 Harrison, Livonia, Mich. 48154 (catalogue, $2). Peach Pits     Q.    My grandfather had the best peaches on his farm and he used to tell us that all he ever did was plant the pits from his favorite peach. Is there any validity to his story? If so, can I do the same? Mrs. J.L.M., Radnor, Pa.     A. In your grandfather's day, planting peach pits and raising the seedlings to fruitful size was probably a rewarding effort. But gardeners are much better advised now to obtain nursery-grown peach trees from reputable nurseries. The trees not only are better suited to the local climate, but there have been extensive advances in peach breeding and culture. Also, many of the new peach trees are grafted onto size-controlling rootstock so that these dwarf trees can be cared for and harvested easily. Peaches are self-pollinating and there is no need to seek a compatible variety for pollination. Rubber Tree     Q.    I have been told that I can prune my Ficus tree, which is now touching the ceiling. How? When? Mrs. P.P., Manhattan.     A. An indoor ficus can be pruned almost any time, but since it is a tropical rubber tree, it will exude a harmless white sap when cut. This is natural and will not harm the tree. To prune, use a sharp pruning shears, if you have them, and trim the tree to suit its shape. After this somewhat drastic treatment, the ficus will languish for a few weeks, but will eventually put out new growth. Do not overfeed or overwater it during this period. Stored Bulbs     Q.    We carefully stored our gladiolus corms from the garden and put them in separate paper bags for each color. When I looked at them recently, they were all sprouting. What can be done so we do not lose them? Mrs. D.L., Kingston, N.Y.     A. It may be that the gladiolus corms have been stored at a temperature that is too warm. Open the storage bags to allow better air circulation. Also if the corms can be removed to a cooler place for storage, they may last until spring planting time. Usually, the old mother corms shrivel and dry, but the little cormels do not and hopefully will last until the late spring planting season.

And again he proceeds to show us, in films taken by several camera crews, the curious aspects and rituals of these people in their distant corners of the world.He takes us first into the jungles of South America, where we meet a tribe of fearsome fellows who wear shiny red disks in their lower lips and catch fish in their muddy rivers by knocking them out with a substance much like DDT. (You must take Mr. Gaisseau's word for it, as you must take his word for much that is amazing in this film.)What is amusing about these fellows is the way they wear bells hanging from their backs so that the bells spank them in the nether region when they engage in tribal dance.Then Mr. Gaisseau shows us a tribe of cliff-dwellers who live in central Africa and perform some delightful ritual dances in fantastic sculptured masks.Next we drop in for brief, familiar visits with the pygmies and the towering Masai, who build their houses of dung abode and munch termites as delicacies","excerpt":"then on for a hasty look-in on the Auen, a vanishing tribe in the African Kalahari Desert, and a leap to New Guinea to renew acquaintance with some of the wild fellows we saw in \\"The Sky Above—the Mud Below.\\"Horrible, but fascinating, are shots of a New Britain tribe that smoke-cures the bodies of its loved ones and then keeps these grisly items like dolls.

Jackson Pollock and Teruko Yokoi, Louise Nevelson and Theo Wujcik, Willem de Kooning and Sarah Supplee are among the names in Mr. Baker's collection, and if it lacks what's fancily called \\"a profile,\\" it has both quality and quantity - more than 1,200 objects so far - comprising a very useful chronological survey of big tides and little ripples from World War II to date. Two ingredients compound the Baker formula: fiscal credit and confidence in his eye, and with it he's gone from amateur status in the sport to full-time professional.   Parts of his holdings have often been shown, but the biggest and most comprehensive selection from it ever - more than 160 works - is now on view at the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design, here in Mr. Baker's old home town (through April 28","excerpt":"then on to the West Coast). Set out cheek by jowl with period furniture and Old Master paintings in this small but eloquent teaching museum, the exhibition includes the most important Baker holdings - Jackson Pollock's \\"Arabesque\\" (1948), Franz Kline's \\"Wanamaker Block\\" (1955), Hans Hofmann's \\"Fortissimo\\" (1956), Roy Lichtenstein's \\"Blam\\" (1962), among others - and a supporting cast chosen to give an overall impression of the collection's international range as well as its diversity of mediums and approaches.   The eye is not always unfailing - for one, by my lights there's too much in the way of the bland non-style known as Photo-Realism - but Mr. Baker obviously didn't set out to \\"shape\\" his holdings. Instead, while buying to please himself, he seems to have a mission to preserve the period, making what he calls his \\"study\\" collection as representative as possible of the art world in the middle years of our century. \\"My collecting approach has been chronological - new work as it comes out,\\" he says. Acknowledging with a smile that \\"self-interest and vanity\\" may play a part in his acquisitionship, Mr. Baker also likes to think he is helping artists \\"become known to as broad a public as possible. I believe they need a wide basis of support, and private collectors are as necessary as museums to their well-being in an economic and emotional sense.\\" He intends to leave the collection to his alma mater, Yale (where part of it is already housed), and the Rhode Island School of Design museum. \\"One reason why I don't sell is that I feel the scene should be available to the future. The collection might be interesting for people looking back to the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's. They may remember de Kooning, but not lesser lights. In our own period, we see all sorts of artists who'll be forgotten later.\\"   Yet, as he points out, there are big gaps - no works by Rothko, Francis Bacon or Clyfford Still, for instance - gaps that he says he doesn't \\"feel obliged to fill. After all, I'm not an institution.\\" Often, when he would like to follow an artist's career to full peak, success will drive prices too high for what Mr. Baker calls his \\"limited means.\\" An example is Roy Lichtenstein: though Mr. Baker was one of the first to buy his work on canvas in the early 60's, by the 80's he could afford to purchase only the artist's prints. On the other hand, a current heavy, Julian Schnabel, is not in the collection at all. \\"By the time I'd heard of him, his paintings were already $80,000,\\" says Mr. Baker.    The collection had its genesis in the late 1940's when Mr. Baker, then a foreign affairs specialist for the State Department in Washington, \\"retired\\" early on a private income to try his hand at writing. Arriving in New York in late 1952, he began to make the round of galleries, and took to the young, postwar generation of abstract artists. With the idea that it would \\"helpful and challenging to buy the work of the living, the young and unestablished,\\" he began making serious acquisitions and one of his very earliest purchases (on view in the show) was a tiny collage by Kurt Schwitters, bought in 1954 from the Museum of Modern Art's Art Lending Service for $250. Two years later, he had already acquired Pollock's now classic \\"Arabesque,\\" Jean Dubuffet's strong and witty \\"Winter Landscape With Two Dogs\\" (both pictures for under $5,000), Kline's powerful \\"Wanamaker Block,\\" and an ardent Calder whimsicality, \\"A Mobile With a Stabile Tail\\" (1947). And then he was off and running, branching out as trend succeeded trend, occasionally piling as many as 70 purchases in a single year.   A tour of the two gallery floors that hold the collection in this small museum gives the viewer a luxurious chance to pit his own taste against Mr. Baker's. Agreed, the Pollock and the Kline are two superb choices, worthy of great museums. No less rewarding are the two Hans Hofmann paintings, \\"Pond\\" and \\"Fortissimo,\\" the former a cool, muted body of green between shores of riotous color; the latter a gorgeous, ordered explosion of brushstrokes that lifts the eye upward. \\"Aerial,\\" a serenely surreal canvas by William Baziotes, is at the top of that artist's form. A dazzling treatise in black and white is offered by Al Held's infinitely polished \\"Volta VIII,\\" with its ballet of geometric forms traced in white against a flat black ground, and Cy Twombly's nearby \\"Untitled,\\" scribbled white rectangles deployed with graffiti-like ease against a backdrop of black.  William Beckman's steely \\"Self Portrait,\\" a puritanical figure against a seductively taffy-colored gessoed ground, is as fine an example of contemporary Realism as anything around. A wonderful charcoal drawing of a reclining nude by Jules Olitski makes one wish for more figurative work from this    echt   abstractionist. Not to be dismissed lightly, either, is the sense of humor that Mr. Baker brings to his calling. It's especially apparent in such works as Robert Arneson's ceramic sculpture \\"The Last Gasp,\\" a portrait of the artist as a red- faced swimmer, mouth open like a fish, perched atop a Roman column (and installed in a gallery under a flossy, putti- filled 18th-century painting by Gian Battista Tiepolo).  On the other hand, one could carp at more than a few of Mr.  Baker's selections, and wonder why he rushed to buy so much, perhaps at the expense of better. The small Nevelson wall piece, for instance, is certainly not representative of that artist at her best, and Kenneth Noland's big, target-like \\"Rhyme\\" shows us the weaker side of Noland's work. Lucas Samaras's recent baroque sculpture has seemed to me not one of his finest efforts, and the small piece here reinforces that opinion, especially in context with other Samarases in the show. One has seen better contributions from Dorothea Rockburne than her drawing \\"Triangle, Small Square,\\" and one wishes that less slick examples could be found from the current Neo-Expressionist scene than Leonard Koscianski's \\"Hunting Ground.\\" Yet if there's such a thing as an    auteur   collector, Mr.  Baker is it. Looking at the larger, overall scope of his efforts, we can be glad that someone of taste and spirit was around to save so much of the present for the future.   - GALLERY VIEW   A COLLECTOR INTENT ON PRESERVING AN ERA"},{"year":"1956","title":"AS soon as a home is built it begins to die.

However, Ozu's extraordinary sensitivity makes them deeply dramatic, all the more so because these gentle, reflective persons seem to have led unruffled lives.The young woman at first appears submissive","excerpt":"then rebels against the notion of an arranged marriage to a stranger. But later she seems more traditional and old-fashioned than her elders, when she violently protests against a rumored remarriage for her mother. She insists that it would be \\"filthy\\" and \\"disgusting,\\" because it would dishonor her father's memory.This is a creature caught between the past and the present. Her modern self rejects the conception of marriage as a mere exercise in forebearance. She also devastates older listeners when she remarks that love and marriage don't always go together. Yet, when facing the fact that her mother might embrace a new life, she's horribly upset by the rift with old conventions.Despite the headshakes of parents deploring their, disobedient children, plus their admission that the newest generation has nothing in common with themselves when young, Ozu also shows that the children's approval is terribly important to the adults. Moreover, the offspring are acutely possessive of their parents—a startling concept for an American audience.The theme of Westernization is subtle throughout. Of course, there are bottles of Johnny Walker and infinite plaid fabrics, inevitable motor bikes and T-shifts. But there are also telling moments when young women in collegiate clothes alternate between the tiny, floating steps conditioned by wearing kimonos and striding freely in their high heels and Western skirts. Again, you sense that Ozu was studying a generation in transition—those who were often torn between traditions and the powerful instinct that it was time to overturn them. And the older generation's efforts to sculpture the young only clench the latter's resistance to the models offered to them.Since Ozu concentrates so much on the interior consciousness, \\"Late Autumn\\" is closer to fiction than to film. As usual, Ozu uses a fairly stationary camera, which rests on the faces of those who are talking.Love is hardly mentioned when the subject of marriage arises. But enormous affection between parents and children, and among old friends, is revealed as it rarely is on screen: often, it's shown through the small jokes that intimates make at one another's expense.Finally, the daughter marries. The mother, asserting that she \\"can't start all over again from scratch,\\" eludes the pressures from her well-wishers, and smiles at the solitude ahead of her. Beautifully acted throughout, especially by Setsuko Hara as the mother, and Yoko Tsukasa as the daughter, \\"Late Autumn\\" stresses that people can't forcibly control the lives of others, not even in the name of fond intentions.

The impression created by it has been overwhelming—the critic, the public, and, most significant of all, the war veteran hailing it as the first and truest expression of the war as it really was. As such it is a historical document of inestimable value, but it is more than that, too It is a thrilling expression of human heroism.The acclaim with which this picture has been greeted is justly mixed with exultation. The French are proud of themselves that after these years when even the best war pictures, such as \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" found it necessary to inject romantic, rhetorical and even bombastic passages, not to mention dubious anecdotes, a French company has done the soldier the justice of depicting his life at the front just as it was.Here we have artistic sincerity—no frills and furbelows, no lovely girls, no artifices, no freak photography, no declamation, no exaggeration. Raymond Bernard decided that nothing could be more dramatic or thrilling than the simple truth. One would think such a conclusion rather obvious, but the answer to that is that it took fourteen years to figure it out.As one critic (and war veteran) put it: \\"The film 'Les Croix de Bois' marks a totally new stage in war cinema photography. Will any one dare, after this, dupe us and abuse us with falsely heroic daubings intended to depict the war?\\"A Fine Script.To begin with, the director has a perfect scenario in the form of the book of the same name by Raymond Dorgelès—a work easily comparable in its way to the German \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" and the English play, \\"Journey's End.\\" It is obvious, too, that M. Bernard had the complete support of his producers, Pathé Natan. Last, but far from least, he had truly superb material in his actors—every one of them a war veteran of whom the director only asked that they relive the terrible days of 1915.The result is a picture which says the last word on its subject. It is at the same time a document and a work of art—a history that is an epic of heroism and martyrdom. Though French to the very core, its appeal is universal. Though the protagonists are simply a handful of men from a French infantry regiment, through the artistic fusion of the elementary passions which animate them they became every soldier, Everyman.The plot is very simple. We see a squad from the Thirty-ninth Infantry fight through certain dark months of 1915 in the Champagne district, until every man of them is a casualty. First we see the flame burning above the tomb of the Unknown Soldier under the Arc de Triomphe","excerpt":"then row upon row of soldiers standing at attention and fading into row upon row of wooden crosses; finally a brief vision of Paris on the day the war was declared, and the story begins.In No Man's Land.Into the billets of a rest camp comes a young law student, Gilbert Demachy, to join a regiment which is a cross-section of the French nation—a baker, some farmers, a few workmen—in no sense professional soldiers. And then one follows their terrible and sublime history—an attack, the patrol in No Man's Land, the rest camp, the return to the lines, the parade of the survivors before the General, then back to the lines again. Only one escapes alive—Sulphart, bluff and hearty diamond in the rough, whose finger is blown off, thus permitting him to retire. The picture ends with Gilbert Demachy, intellectual, sensitive, courageous, dying alone in the slime of a deserted battlefield, while over his head in a symbolic procession file an array of the dead, each carrying his wooden cross.It is, more than anything, simply a series of episodes, but linked by the common themes of loyalty, courage, suffering and death. Certain fragments stand out as unforgetable. There is Gilbert Demachy, visiting the grave of a comrade to scatter over it the fragments of a letter which came too late. There is the death of Corporal Breval—a simple, brave soldier who had gone out near the enemy's lines to seek water for his squad and had been shot down. There is the parade of the survivors—one of the most thrilling and heart-throbbing scenes the moving pictures have given us. There is, above all, the attack—a stupendous technical tour de force, faithful to the smallest details.It is this fidelity which is the outstanding achievement of the film. The authors sought only to give us the reality in all its horrors, its crudities, its agonies and its greatness. The dialogue is taken directly from the book and consists chiefly of biting sallies, grim jokes, slang phrases—all the restrained emotion of men living at the breaking point, afraid to give way to their feelings, but seeing with bitter humor the irony of their situation. There is an exaltation about the grim jesting in the face of tragedy which gives a curious touch of nobility to what they say. The coarseness, the blasphemy even, upon which men fall back in times like those, is but a camouflage for emotions which must not be expressed lest they make men lose their courage. This quality, which Dorgelès expressed so beautifully in his book, is expertly caught for the screen.The Lesson.Inevitably, in the wealth of discussion the picture has already aroused, the question cropped up as to whether \\"Les Croix de Bois\\" was an argument for or against war. Certainly, the producers, the director and the author of the book meant it to be against. So much so, in fact, that the first showing of it was in Geneva for the delegates to the Disarmament Conference. However, the next was here in Paris for the veterans of the Thirty-ninth Infantry. Then the press saw it, and finally it was opened to the public at a gala performance which the President of France attended. In each case—particularly the press comments—the horror and anguish and tragedy of the subject were stressed.The picture itself consciously points no moral at all. It simply presents war as it was, and the audience writes its own moral. The key, then, lies with the spectators and their reactions. Your correspondent attended the press showing, and there, at least, the feeling was unmistakable. The applause for the dying Corporal Breval was a tribute to fine acting, but that for Demachy standing beside the grave of his comrade was a tribute to the fallen soldier, as well as to the beauty and pathos of the scene. And the waves upon waves of applause which punctuated the various attack scenes were the result of sheer exultation, which reached a tremendous climax in the marvelous parade of the survivors.Heroes of the Past.After all, these people were saying to themselves, consciously or unconsciously, men were giants in those days. The high courage, the unselfishness, the uncomplaining acceptance of suffering, the sacrifice of life for ideals they thought true—these were great qualities. This particular audience must have been thinking: These men we see here were Frenchmen, our own flesh and blood.And what about the veterans, of whom there must have been hundreds in the audience? Could any of them have failed to think that just to march once more in such a parade of the survivors they would not go through again the inferno of those days?So, it would be hard to say that \\"Les Croix de Bois\\" is the perfect argument for peace—which is just as well. A work of art need not point a moral. Raymond Bernard has produced a great picture, and nothing else matters.WARNER BROTHERS-First National Studios have passed the halfway mark of the season's total of seventy pictures, and the affiliated companies will continue to maintain a year-round policy of from four to eight photoplays each month, it is announced.That the Burbank plant of the organization is busy is indicated in the fact that the daily chart shows that more than 5,000 persons are employed daily, with as many as 1,700 extras being used in a single day.Production on six pictures is scheduled for next month. The first three will be \\"The Mud Lark,\\" Arthur Stringer's tale of the wheat fields, which will afford a vehicle for Barbara Stanwyck; \\"S. S. Atlantic,\\" with Kay Francis, and \\"Silver Dollar,\\" with Edward G. Robinson. Later will come \\"The Dark Horse,\\" a political story by Joe Jackson and Courtenay Terrett, featuring Warren William, Bette Davis and Guy Kibbee. The picture will be directed by Alfred E. Green. William Powell and Kay Francis will be the principal stars in \\"The Jewel Robbery,\\" directed by William Doeterle.A Technicolor production, \\"Doctor X,\\" with a cast that includes Lionel Atwill, George Rosener and Kay Wray, is being prepared.Eight other pictures slated to start or already in production are \\"Week-End Marriage,\\" with Loretta young and Norman Foster, adapted from the novel by Faith Baldwin; \\"Competition,\\" with Chic Sale; \\"Central Park,\\" described as a romance of New York; \\"Winner Take All,\\" with James Cagney; \\"A Successful Calamity,\\" in which George Arliss has the principal rôle and is supported by Mary Astor, Evalyn Knapp and Grant Mitchell; \\"Love Is a Racket,\\" with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Ann Dvorak; \\"Street of Women,\\" with Kay Francis in the main part, and \\"Two Seconds,\\" with Edward G.

Those who may decide that the director has called too freely upon pictorial license in his illustration of sacrifice and depicting coincidence will nevertheless be deeply impressed by the sterling sea scenes taken from the navy's film archives. These sequences carry with them a keen conception of the cruel and penetrating chill of the gray-green North Sea. You see a periscope, the wake of a torpedo and then a destroyer plunging through the rough waters after the submarine, dropping depth bombs over the spot where the U-boat submerged. Then there are glimpses which prove the value of a smoke screen in hiding a convoy of transports from the one-eyed enemy craft.One of the exciting episodes in this film shows the torpedoing of a passenger vessel, which brings to mind the sinking of the Lusitania. Another remarkable sequence depicts a giant enemy battleship gradually disappearing under the water. In this last incident one first sees the vessel before she is struck","excerpt":"then the steel monster keels over on her side, the crew, like tiny insects, struggling to cling to the upper rail or get a hold on the decks. The great vessel then turns turtle, floating for a second or so before she is engulfed by the water. Scores of men can be seen leaping from the overturned seafighter as she goes down.The narrative of this production is concerned with Sylvia Dodge's sacrifice. This American girl is urged by a departmental chief of the Secret Service to watch Ernest Drake, a German intelligence officer, who endeavors to gain information about the first convoy through sending bouquets of flowers to pretty girls. He also uses the names of the different blossoms as a code.Through the secrecy maintained regarding the arrest of Drake, whose real name is von Drachenfels, Sylvia becomes a social outcast. It is presumed that she had an affair with Drake and there is a suspicion, through an article in a scandal sheet, that she may even have endeavored to give the enemy information about the sailing of the first convoy. Sylvia is not only humiliated, but because she refuses to tell her true name she is sent to prison for a year. In the end, however, her loyalty is rewarded.This picture was first started by Lothar Mendes, the German director, but as Joseph C. Boyle did virtually all the work he is credited with its direction. Mr. Boyle is not always as imaginative as he might be in some of the scenes wherein Drake and Sylvia figure. He evidently wants to give the audience plenty of time to study Dorothy Mackaill's attractive countenance. Lowell Sherman is excellent in his part. He makes the most of all his scenes, whether it is signing a paper, avoiding the handcuffs or making a gallant parting speech to the heroine. Ian Keith, who figures as the Secret Service agent, is another actor who seems to be thinking about what he (as the character) is doing. William Collier Jr. is satisfactory as Sylvia's brother and Lawrence Gray does quite well as the fiancé. Miss Mackaill appears to forget, during those episodes in which Sylvia is humiliated, that the girl's bearing might still have possessed something of the society girl in lieu of a cringing creature. It was necessary to register dejection and not abject humility. Sylvia is supposed to have been astute enough to disarm Drake, and, therefore, one is bound to expect some sort of haughty bearing when the Magistrate arbitrarily sentences her to prison. Review 1 -- No Title"},{"year":"1931","title":"TWO important problems confront the German film producers of today—Summer repertory and censorship. The first of these is worrying all film theatres, no matter what their size. For Summer has begun in earnest with an intense heat wave, and it is hard to persuade even the most ardent fans to spend an evening at a talker. The film producers know this and do not make enough films to keep the theatres supplied in the dull season. So it is difficult to figure out where the theatre owners will get enough satisfactory pictures to keep their houses open until Fall.Therefore Summer is the time when the law which limits the importation of foreign films into Germany pinches most. It may or may not protect the German market, but at any rate the owners of film theatres are the real sufferers from it. Indeed, their actual existence is threatened and they demand in the name of the public the abolishment of a regulation which is so one-sided in its benefits.Film Law Severe.It is now a habit of the German film industry to produce simultaneously films based on practically the same theme. It is obvious that this is bound to make the repertory extremely monotonous. After seeing one crook film you do not want to have three or four more pictures of the same type thrust upon you. Protected as it is by the import restrictions, the film industry believes that it only needs to produce films on a \\"quantity\\" basis. So in reality the law prevents the free artistic development of films and is an obstacle to the internationalization of film production.It seems ridiculous that the theatre owner should be in a quandary as to what to offer his audiences when there are so many excellent foreign films that he might run. But the law keeps them out of the country. He has to content himself with a third-rate talker and pray for rain.Any one who knows what excellent films are being produced in foreign lands finds the programs of the Berlin film theatres dull and even boring. All last Winter's successes are trotted out again. Films that have long become dusty on their shelves are dragged out to the light, and it is at once evident that most of their former glory has faded. It may be all right to see two or three, even four, times \\"Zwei Herzen im Dreivierteltakt\\" and \\"The Night Is Ours,\\" but that is no final solution of the problem of Summer repertory.So it is no wonder that the French film \\"The Million,\\" directed by Rénée Clair, was received with acclaim. The director was personally present at the Berlin premiére as a gesture of gratitude to the German people, who had shown their appreciation of his art even before his own countrymen. After the phenomenal success of his first film, \\"Sous les Toits de Paris,\\" M. Clair needs no introduction. He took Berlin by storm and has added to his laurels with his new success. \\"The Million,\\" as was \\"Sous les Toits de Paris,\\" is laid in a romanticized version of bohemian Paris. Then it was Montparnasse, now Montmartre","excerpt":"then the story concerned itself with the apache; here it is bohemian life as we like to pretend it exists, with its painters, sculptors and dancers.Rénée Clair's picture is a talker operetta, the basic motive of which is derived from a theatrical comedy. The hero wins the big lottery just as he is completely down and out. A beggar steals the coat in which the lottery ticket is hidden, pawns it and a mad hunt for the missing piece of clothing begins. All Paris joins in the chase. An opera-singer buys the coat from the pawnshop to wear it as a stage costume. The crowd finds this out and starts for the opera house. The tenor is on the stage, sobbing forth his big aria. Through the auditorium, up to the footlights and almost on to the stage, the crowd surges but they do not get the coat after all.These scenes afford Rénée Clair splendid opportunities for spontaneous humor. The influence of the most rollicking American comedy is evident and, although neither Chaplin nor Keaton are there to send us off into gales of laughter, the humor of this is unquestionably the best offered us to date by a European talker. Rénée Lefèbre—who wins the lottery, loses it by a hair's breadth, only to recover it again at the end—has the leading rôle and is assisted by the attractive Mlle. Annabelle. The rest of the cast are not stars but they are particularly well chosen types, and the director has known how to make them dance to his tune. He proves to us that a foreign language need be no barrier in the portrayal of humor. Though \\"The Million\\" is characteristically French, it is, nevertheless, decidedly international in its appeal. You only need a bit of imagination to grasp the story's meaning.A second important film which rightly deserves its success is the Nero film \\"M,\\" directed by Fritz Lang. Behind this mysterious letter \\"M\\" a tale of crime and mystery is hidden. In sinister red, standing out on the upturned palm of a white hand, this intriguing symbol has been plastered all over Berlin.\\"M\\" stands, as you have probably guessed, for \\"murderer,\\" the German word \\"mörder\\" being practically identical with the English. This murderer recalls the notorious Peter Kürten—the Düsseldorf Jack the Ripper who has dozens of crimes on his conscience and who, recently sentenced to death, is now awaiting his execution. The plot of this film is somewhat similar to his case but is of course, infinitely more sensational and develops into a rip-roaring murder mystery.Tried by the Underworld.We are shown a city gripped with terror. The police are on the track of the murderer but clue after clue proves misleading. The underworld finds its existence menaced because of the panic that has stricken the city and the huge number of policemen patrolling the streets. They decide that something must be done. They work out a campaign and capture the murderer.So not the police but the criminals themselves succeed in bringing him to justice. They have organized their own conception of a court. In an intensely dramatic scene the murderer is dragged before this tribunal, and just as an emotional high point is reached the police break in.The end of the film is considerably weaker. Fritz Lang, who up to now had directed with an iron hand and kept his audience on the edge of their seats, now chose to drag in a treatment of the problem of capital punishment. This slowed up the tempo of an otherwise fast-moving picture and annoyed the audience, who had come merely to be entertained.Whether censorship in its present form has a right to exist is a question which is being heatedly discussed. Liberal-minded opinion is against its continuation. It seems entirely conversive of all the conceptions of intellectual freedom.For this state of affairs the Filmprüfstelle (Board of Censors) is alone to blame, as its members do not seem to have grasped modern democratic ideals. Their reactionary political convictions hamper them in judging modern artistic and social ideas. The education of the people in general and of youth in particular—two much-discussed topics of modern Germany—are problems of too overwhelming a significance to be lightly solved by a haphazardly selected commission. You will probably recall the very questionable decision of this board on the Remarque film \\"Im Westen Nichts Neues,\\" for this was a world sensation. So experience has proved that the German censorship law has turned into a doubleedged sword. A bitter fight is being waged against it and this, let us hope, will result in its abolition or, at least, in its revision.

Messrs, McLaglen and Lowe are aided in their low comedy by El Brendel, who is a private in the marines, while Flagg and Quirt are top sergeants in the same force.Raoul Walsh, director of \\"The Cock-Eyed World,\\" is also responsible for the far from subtle activities of this offering, which is one that will probably please those who liked its predecessor. It begins with flashes of the World War and then swings to the Panama Canal, where Quirt enjoys the satisfaction of escorting Flagg to the brig and locking him up.

The place is raided and Flagg only considers saving Quirt from the police when the latter consents to liquidate an old debt and rejoin the marines.In this film, the events take Flagg and Quirt, to Sweden, where the leathernecks are supposed to be on a good-will mission. Here the rivals encounter Elsa, a dainty blonde, but they also meet her sweetheart, Olaf, who proves himself to be more than an equal for Flagg, Quirt and Olsen (Mr. Brendel). Olaf in rage throws the three marines through a wall and, according to a later report from Elsa, he subsequently tore down the whole building, which gives a faint idea of the stuff of which this screen story consists.In course of time the adventurers are beheld in Turkey, where they learn that Elsa has become a favorite of the much-feared Prince Hassam, whose wives are many.

Oddly, for all their differences, these problematic works actually form a matching set; a new genre is evident, even though the species of Met premieres is doomed for the moment.   At first glance, of course, the differences between the works seem profound. One is a gussied-up Minimalist opera, the other a neo-Romantic romp that verges on high camp. Mr. Glass's style depends on repetitions of rhythmic cells and Mr. Corigliano's on skewed quotations of Rossini and Mozart. Mr. Glass's story is inspired by Doris Lessing and science fiction, Mr. Corigliano's by Beaumarchais's Figaro character. \\"The Voyage\\" gives three almost distinct examples of voyages: an alien spaceship crashes on Earth during the last ice age; Columbus journeys to the New World, and Earthlings of the future depart to find life in space. \\"Ghosts\\" shows Beaumarchais amusing the aristocracy in the afterlife; he tries to alter history by entering his own plays and saving Marie Antoinette from the guillotine.

SETTING THE SCENE FOR THE UNLIKELY"},{"year":"1998","title":"FROM his vantage point as the chief investment officer of Deutsche Bank, Hanspeter Ackermann sees expanding opportunities for investors in a unifying Europe. As portfolio manager of the bank's closed-end New Germany fund, a $665 million growth fund invested primarily in midsize German companies, Mr. Ackermann is deploying money to pursue some of those opportunities. And as a Swiss citizen, he sees firsthand the significance of being inside or outside the euro club.   SHARON R. KING    Q. How will investing in Europe change as a result of the creation of the single European currency?   A. The top-down style of selecting stocks, where you analyze country, industry and then go down to the stock level, probably becomes irrelevant. The opposite of that is a bottom-up manager, which basically is our style. We really don't look at macro themes, but much more company-specific data.     The concept of the country fund itself at some point will probably have to be wider. I can imagine that some funds might consider changing to a more European-based fund.   Q. How should American investors be thinking about the part of their portfolio that they will invest in a changing Europe?   A. Before, you had different countries, like Germany and France, individually fighting for market share. They all looked insignificant relative to a large country like the United States. Now this is changing. You have a major competitor -- let's just call it Europe. It has a much more powerful industrial base. It will not be inhibited by any cross-border taxation or inefficiencies.     What we're going to see here is a major structural change, much higher efficiency. I think that there will probably be more money allocated to Europe than in the past.   Q. What about countries that remain outside the monetary union?   A. For a country like Britain, it's probably less of an issue to be in or out, because it's a much larger economy with much less dependence on Europe. The U.K. has had more cross-border alliances with the United States than with Europe, so it will be easier for the U.K. to stand outside and to remain outside.    In the case of Switzerland, I see difficulties for that country to stay out and to compete with the border restrictions.    I'm not sure how much the financial sector will be affected, but you could see some impact mainly from the currency translation on other manufacturing sectors.    Right now the Swiss franc is relatively strong, and that's obviously damaging the export industry. But currency fluctuations may make it difficult for corporations to plan ahead. For the smaller European countries, sooner or later they're going to be forced into the same situation, where there will be an overwhelming economic case for joining the European Monetary Union. So, my guess will be they're all going to join over time.   Q. Will companies in countries outside of the monetary union have growth problems?   A. Yes. Distribution will be a problem.    I'm from Switzerland. When I walk through customs in Europe, they treat me like any other passport holder. But if you are part of the union, they basically just wave you through.    The same effect will probably occur on any distribution or licensing agreement. You would rather give the members of the union preferential treatment. So obviously there's an advantage to being part of the union.   Q. From an investment standpoint, will countries outside of the monetary union be riskier?   A. They should be. You're dealing with higher currency risk","excerpt":"then you have the economic risk of not gaining access to the same markets. There's even a risk of size, which means a liquidity risk.   Q. How do you pick stocks for the bank's funds?   A. There are five criteria. The most important is earnings momentum, to which we allocate roughly one-third of the investment decision-making.     Another third would be management. We look at the track record and the commitment to enhance the company's value. The final third is split between the financial strength of the company and its overall value versus the industry, the stock's history and the market itself.    Q. What are some stocks you own that fit your criteria?   A. One of our biggest holdings is Adidas. We have 8.6 percent of the fund in that company. They have acquired Salomon, the ski producer. When we look at other companies like Nike, or Puma in Europe, most of them have lost market share to Adidas-Salomon. And this is one of the few true growth stories in Germany, in our belief.    This company has excellent management. We see roughly 20 to 25 percent earnings growth consistently into the year 2000.     What's not included in that figure yet is the effects of the Salomon acquisition. Salomon has had its strength mainly in France, and Adidas has had its strength mostly in Germany. But now there should be a massive benefit from synergies.    We also like Continental A.G. We have about 4.3 percent of the fund in that. Continental has had compound earnings growth of about 25 percent for three years, and I think it has been overlooked by the market.     What's interesting is that they're really a leader in technology. There's huge free cash flow, and 1998 should be a turnaround year for the company as margins increase.    In Europe there are two other major tire companies, Pirelli and Michelin. In our view, there's no room for three major companies in Europe, so at some point you're going to see a merger or an alliance.    In Wella A.G., the beauty products company, we've seen a management turnaround. In the past, Wella's management has not been very open, and they came to a point in 1995 where the management disappointed and earnings fell by about 50 percent. That obviously shocked the market.    The perception was: We cannot trust that firm anymore. But the company did make changes within the management to come back and regain the confidence. I think we were one of the first to recognize that they are pursuing a much more shareholder-friendly attitude.

Storer Clouston a generation ago. Leon Errol is the stellar light in this comedy and he gives a performance that could hardly be improved upon by funmakers more experienced in acting before the camera. Mr. Errol gave a good account of himself in his first picture, \\"Clothes Make the Pirate,\\" but taking it all in all, he does even better as a dumfounded tramp who, through nothing more than a change of clothes and a letter, goes through enough excitement to last the average man a year or so.There are quiet moments in this production, but they are none the less interesting. There are comic interludes that elicit chuckles and then there are hilarious sequences that evidently appealed to the audience yesterday afternoon. This comedy is so good that it seems short, a true recommendation for any shadow entertainment.Mr. Errol as Sam Smith foregoes the demonstration with his loose ankle and leg until the psychological moment. You may expect that it is going to happen at any time and therefore when it does occur it is all the funnier. A memorable stretch in this mirthful chronicle depicts Sam Smith in an asylum for mentally unbalanced men of wealthy families. Sam, who is totally unaware of the character of the imposing residence, fixes his gaze upon a serious-visaged gentleman with Napoleonic mannerisms and forelock. He discusses this individual's eccentricity with another man, who informs Sam that the strange person believes that he is Napoleon.\\"But,\\" adds Sam's informant, \\"he ought to know that I am Napoleon.\\"Sam walks across the room to look at a man seated at a desk. This inmate is writing addresses on envelopes","excerpt":"then, after stamping them, he tears them to bits. Mystified, Sam sits on a sofa and begins talking to a cool-looking fellow, whose conversation is coherent up to the point when he feels he needs a cigarette. Then this singular young man goes through the motions of rolling a cigarette, even to brushing the supposed crumbs of tobacco off his clothes, without having either tobacco or paper. He pretends to strike a match, and Sam steals away.One of the sequences in which Mr. Errol crumples up is where he has smashed a statue and decides to put another, at the other end of the hall, on the empty pedestal. The Errol ankle bears up well, but just before Sam reaches his destination the leg and ankle begin to show signs of buckling up The inevitable crash comes without the statue suffering, but it is not long before this Venus de Milo loses her head.There is a chapter of two aboard an airship, with Sam banging into the gears so that the great vessel climbs and descends at dangerous angles. Sam and one of the officers unexpectedly find themselves looking from an unholy height at mother earth, with only a finger-clutch to stay them from falling.Dorothy Mackaill officiates as the heroine and Kenneth MacKenna fills the dual rôle of two brothers. Both players are equal to the demands made of them. Mr. Errol has a jolly time, in one close-up making the pupils of his eyes move in opposite directions.

As a new student who becomes their \\"ruler\\" and go-between for a gang of adult peddlers, Mr. Tamblyn turns out to be the youngest-looking undercover agent for the F. B. I. in history.Now the conditions so self-consciously detailed in this picture may be true somewhere, somehow. One actor, as a local commissioner, calls them indicative, citing an Indiana school tragedy. To fire right back at him, confidentially, the kids here simply look too clean and sensible (and well-heeled) to be such unmitigated young dopes — literally. And such dull, unimaginative young meatballs.What are they like? In the sunniest of communities, these attractive yearlings wallow around in backstairs bistro, conniving to \\"fly high\\" and mooning over a \\"jive\\" band. At one excruciating point, to jazz accompaniment, a young brunette drawls a poem that has about as much coherence as a cat fight.Oddly enough, considering the breathless title, the youngsters' weird, inane behavior is light on drinking and actual promiscuity. Inside the classroom itself they're pretty orderly. Which is why it comes as a real jolt to hear a Dresden Doll like Diane Jergens begging Mr. Tamblyn and John Drew Barrymore for \\"some stuff.\\" Or, worse still, to see little Jody Fair suddenly writhe and clutch her needle-scarred forearm. Only a few minutes before, incidentally, the youngsters are seen happily cavorting in a lawn swimming pool.A few adults look in on the proceedings, and all rather thickly. The exception is Miss Sterling, as a well-meaning but rather naïve teacher. A fine, honest performer, likewise Mr. Tamblyn. We maintain that the picture is neither.Why sandwich in, for instance, the extremely shapely Mamie Van Doren as Mr. Tamblyn's aunt? (That's right—aunt.) What, exactly, have her attempts at his seduction to do with the price of beans—or dope? As an actress she also manages to coil herself around a refrigerator like a python.While he turns into a nice guy, or spy, at the very end, Mr. Tamblyn's distasteful characterization dominates the picture. Even with the righteous climax, this extended portrait of a surly, arrogant strutter, who is held in awe by the cowed students, is going to be too much for a lot of people out front to take for so long.

I knew women with a somewhat wobbly sense of self-assurance who would steel themselves for a trip to Bloomingdale's or Bendel's, and come away feeling that they'd passed some sort of test: they hadn't been humiliated or intimidated; they'd held their ground in the face of the salespeople's scorn, real or imagined.

The brash young choreographer had just received a standing ovation at the opening night of his \\"L'Allegro, Il Penseroso ed Il Moderato,\\" a kind of mood-swing ballet presented as part of Lincoln Center's Serious Fun Festival.    \\"It was very good,\\" said Mrs. Morris, who was in a matronly pink dress. \\"I didn't see one misstep all night.\\"    Mr. Morris, who was in a lot of canary yellow, enjoyed watching his work, too, despite the woman sitting behind him. \\"She was wearing all these jingly-jangly silver bracelets,\\" he said as he chain-smoked and guzzled a tall can of beer. \\"If it had been somebody else's performance, I'd have ripped them off her.\\"    If the evening-length ballet was an abstract depiction of the introvert and the extovert, mother and son were the living embodiment of those bipolar qualities.    \\"I have a lot of pep,\\" Mr. Morris said.   \\"You could call him a showoff at times, I guess,\\" said the reticent Mrs. Morris, as she watched an international crowd lavish compliments on her son.    \\"It's epic-making!\\" someone told him.    \\"What a thrill it is to be here!\\" someone else added.    The antic Mr. Morris, in turn, expressed himself in flamboyant language peppered with an occasional obscenity his mother chose to ignore.     \\"He's not allowed to use profanity at home,\\" she said. \\"And neither are his friends.\\"    When things had quieted down, mother and son left the dressing room for a reception on the theater's promenade. \\"If I'm hanging on to you, it's only because I'm a little tired,\\" said Mrs. Morris, who had just arrived from Seattle, where, as a toddler, Mr. Morris hung on to a coffee table in her living room while dancing.    \\"Don't worry, Mom, I have enough equilibrium for the both of us,\\" he said. \\"I just hope there's beer up there.\\" Mrs. Morris, who doesn't approve of drinking, said she was looking forward to a glass of Coca-Cola.    \\"It's a fete! It's a fete!\\" Mr. Morris yelled as they were welcomed with applause and showered with more compliments. After an hour, it was time to call it a night.    \\"They've closed the bar, for Christ's sake,\\" Mr. Morris said before catching himself and telling his mother he didn't mean to use the Lord's name in vain.    \\"But, since I'm not a Christian, I can,\\" he added. His mother didn't care to argue the point.    \\"Come on, let's blow, Mom,\\" he said.    \\"O.K.,\\" she said.    \\"Let's get the hell out of here,\\" he added.    During the fraction of a second that passed, Mrs. Morris didn't even have to raise an eyebrow.    \\"I mean,\\" Mr. Morris said, \\"heck.\\"   Beyond the Red Carpet    It was near midnight on July 5, and a private party welcoming Christy Turlington as a new partner in the Fashion Cafe was still in progress. April Sandmeyer, a sweet-natured woman with a childlike smile, had been standing with a crowd behind police barricades outside the themey-restaurant at Rockefeller Center for five hours.    \\"My daughter's inside and I didn't want her to be here alone,\\" Mrs. Sandmeyer said as thin somebodies like Jay McInerney and Carmen Dell'Orefice came and went on a red carpet in front of a crowd of gawkers who didn't recognize them.    \\"She loves the modeling world,\\" Mrs. Sandmeyer said about her daughter, Maria Caballero, 17, who has a part in the new movie \\"Kids,\\" directed by Larry Clark. \\"It's what she really wants to do. She's had a vanity problem since she was 13. It used to take her a minimum of two hours to get ready to go to school, but now that straight hair is back in, she doesn't have to go through quite so many contortions.\\"    Naomi Campbell, who long ago had made a dazzling entrance with her Fashion Cafe partners, Ms. Turlington, Claudia Schiffer and Elle Macpherson, stepped outside.    \\"Thanks for coming, everybody,\\" she said before disappearing into a car. \\"Please go home now because the party's over.\\"    Mrs. Sandmeyer, along with the rest of the crowd, held her ground. \\"I hope Maria comes out soon,\\" she said as she shifted on her tennis sneakers. More time passed. More people who looked important -- Eileen Ford, Kevin Aucoin, Kenny Scharf, Quincy Jones -- came out of the party. Finally, Ms. Caballero, a slender, somewhat exotic-looking teen-ager in a blue cocktail dress, appeared with a much older man at her side.    \\"I'd like to take her to the Whiskey Bar for one drink and then I'll bring her right home,\\" the man told Mrs. Sandmeyer, who sent him teetering off by himself with her pleasant but unyielding smile.    \\"This is why I wanted to wait here,\\" she told her daughter, who proceeded to report on the party.    \\"It was pretty boring,\\" Ms. Caballero said with the grand ennui of the Manhattan teen-ager. \\"The band was good. The food was O.K.\\"     \\"What about the decor?\\" her mother asked.    \\"It was a little cheesy,\\" Ms. Caballero said, adding that the supermodels in attendance had pretty much kept to themselves all evening and that she was a little disappointed not to have met any modeling agents. \\"If I can make a living by standing in front of a camera everyday, I'd love to do that,\\" she said. \\"Otherwise, I'll just be a recording artist.\\" Her mother muttered something about attending college first","excerpt":"then, she inquired about Ms. Macpherson's skintight, somewhat diaphanous pants.    \\"Was that her underwear you could see underneath?\\" Mrs. Sandmeyer asked.    \\"It was a red thong,\\" Ms. Caballero answered.     Having established that essential point, it was time to go home. And not by bus, either.     \\"I'm taking you home by cab, Mom,\\" she said. Introverts, Extroverts And Mothers Who Wait"},{"year":"1926","title":"Photodramas dealing with the downfall of the Romanoffs invariably turn out to be innocuous affairs, and the picture at the Mark Strand, \\"Into Her Kingdom,\\" which has the decided advantage of the charming presence of Corinne Griffith, is no shining exception. If anything, this new Russian yarn is more inept than its predecessors, despite its excellent stage settings and a fairly competent cast. But great halls, waxed, floors, gorgeous costumes, long lines of straight-faced soldiers are not apt to prove vastly entertaining when the dramatic value of the vehicle is negligible.Most of the attempts to picture the cruelty of the Czarists and the brutally of the Bolsheviki end in a draw. This time the hero seems hardly deserving of the heroine. He is a thin-skinned creature who has a chip on his shoulder from the outset. He is quick to taunt the young Grand Duchess for permitting her maid to die for her, and he does not appear to stand by his own cause.There are a number or absurd episodes in this piece of work, but possibly none of them is more ludicrous than the chapter wherein the Grand Duchess, while dwelling in a small New Jersey community, surprises a group of Royalists, who have come all the way from Europe, by appearing before them with a baby in her arms. The proceeds to inform the gathering that Stepan, the inglorious hero, is the father of the child.The Royalists are peeved, for they had instructed the young Grand Duchess of all the Russians to appear before them in her court attire. They inform Stepan that he will hear more about the matter.After Stepan has married the Grand Duchess by the Soviet law he brings his wife to America, and in the subtitles he whines as follows:\\"Sometimes I think her heart is softening","excerpt":"then, she is royal and I am a serf.\\"It is set forth that the Czar and his family were shot on July 16, 1918. The Grand Duchess escapes death because her maid, Sonia, insists that she, the maid, is the Grand Duchess. So the imperious beauty becomes known as Sonia.Perhaps Grand Duchesses are tempted to put on their old court regalia when talking to children. The heroine of this story does so because some youngsters want to gaze upon a real Princess; therefore she goes, upstairs and soon appears in a glistening headdress, which encompasses her chin, and her royal robes.In the early part of the narrative Corinne Griffith is seen as a young girl, who is quite headstrong when it comes to looking at Punch and Judy shows. It is while watching such an entertainment that she meets Stepan, and after being introduced to him she remarks on his dirty hands, to which he retorts that her hands would also be dirty if she toiled.Einar Hanson, is acceptable as the vacillating Stepan. Miss Griffith's performance is pleasing, but she is not suited to portraying a stubborn little girl. Claude Gillingwater overacts in the part of the tutor.Major Gen. Michael Pleschkoff officiates as the Court Chamberlain. Russian officers and court leaders are impersonated by Major Gen. Lodigenski, Major Gen. Ikanikoff, Major Gen.

With a new president come new curtains. Vanity Fair asked designers to offer ideas on redecorating the White House, while The Guardian asked architects for a redesigned Oval Office. In both cases, the results are pragmatic and bland. President Bush has used the same desk as every other president since Garfield (except Johnson, Nixon and Ford, says the White House Web site), so I imagine Obama will, too. But what else could he employ to inspire a productive workplace? I’ve lost an hour or two in The Selby. It’s a Web site that curates the detritus of aesthetically minded people: the gorgeous junk that inspires various arts-related people and sits around the house. Which reminds me of Francis Bacon’s studio. In August 1998, according to Dublin’s Hugh Lane Gallery, more than 7,000 items in his workplace were catalogued in a database, including “approximately 570 books and catalogs, 1,500 photographs, 100 slashed canvases, 1,300 leaves torn from books, 2,000 artist’s materials and 70 drawings.” A book was compiled, but the gallery maintains a good amount of imagery online. President-elect Obama is a writer, though, not a painter. The Daily Routines blog collects writers’ work habits. Take Emily Post: “She woke at 6:30 a.m., ate breakfast in bed and began to write. Midmorning, she took a break to give instructions to the household help","excerpt":"then, still in bed, she continued to write until noon.” Better than its redecorating feature, The Guardian regularly updates its archive of writers describing their rooms, where I learned that Martin Amis works out of some kind of garden shed. I also like this collection of beautiful geek workspace setups, charmingly titled “Les Plus Beaux Bureaux de Geeks.” Why not simply gaze on this magnificent picture of Al Gore at his desk. If a man needs three enormous monitors for his computer, he’s obviously saving the world. Near my old apartment in Paris was the dusty Les Archives de la Presse bookstore. I used to love looking through the windows at the stacks of vintage fashion magazines. With less beauty but more zing, this collection of New York magazines from 1965 to 1997 should inspire any young wannabe editor or art director. After all, it’s not too far a jump from New York 1968 to Monocle 2008. I enjoy a good how-to as much as the next man, especially when it explains the backstory of how something great came to be. This illustrated history of movie studios’ logos has meat on its bones, but more interesting is the design saga behind President-elect Obama’s well-known logo.

King, a black motorist who was subdued by repeated kicks and 56 blows from police batons.   As closing arguments began today after seven weeks of testimony by 55 witnesses, the prosecutor, Terry White, a deputy district attorney, brushed aside defense arguments that the officers followed proper procedure in the beating on March 3, 1991.   The beating caused widespread revulsion, touched off a national debate over police excesses and led for a search to replace Chief Daryl F. Gates. That search ended last week when it was announced that Willie L. Williams, the Police Commissioner in Philadelphia, would succeed Chief Gates.   Defense witnesses have described the beating, which was filmed by an amateur photographer, as one that conformed with standard police guidelines on the use of force. In the twisting and turning of the mostly prone Mr. King, they have pointed to what they described as threatening movements that would have justified the officers' continuing use of force. Final Showing of Videptape    Noting that Mr. King had not been called to testify, Mr. White said: \\"What more could you ask for? You have the videotape that shows objectively, without bias, impartially, what happened that night. The videotape shows conclusively what happened that night. It can't be rebutted.\\"   Mr. White concluded his statement with a final showing of the 81-second videotape and a question to the jurors, \\"Now who do you believe, the defendants or your own eyes?\\"   The defendants are Sgt. Stacey C. Koon, 41 years old, and Officers Laurence M. Powell, 29","excerpt":"Theodore J. Briseno, 39; and Timothy E. Wind, 31.  Three of them have been suspended from the force without pay. and Officer Wind, a rookie without tenure, has been dismissed.   Lawyers for the four defendants will present their closing arguments at the conclusion of Mr. White's presentation.   Their summations are expected to clash because Officer Briseno, who did not use a baton and is only shown kicking Mr. King once in the head, has turned on his fellow officers, accusing them of acting \\"out of control.\\" Charges and Penalties    If convicted, the defendants face possible maximum prison terms ranging from four years for Officer Briseno to seven years for Officer Wind.   Sergeant Koon and Officer Powell, who face a maximum sentence of seven years and eight months if convicted , are also charged with filing false police reports that played down the severity of the beating, a point Mr. White said demonstrated that they knew they had broken the law.   Speaking of Officer Powell's police report, the prosecutor said: \\"He knew at that time and he knows today that what happened out there was wrong. It was unlawful. He could not afford to write a true police report.\\"   The videotape, which has been dissected by defense lawyers and their witnesses, is unambiguous when viewed in its entirety, Mr. White said.   \\"At some point reasonable force can become unreasonable, and you have to determine what point that is,\\" he told the jury. \\"When you reach the point on that tape where you say 'Enough is enough,' that's where reasonable force ends. And that is what this whole case boils down to.\\"   Rather than showing an aggressive suspect, he said: \\"When you look at this tape, you have a man on the ground rolling around and they continued to strike him. What is he doing to be a threat to them?\\"   An independent commission headed by Warren M. Christopher, a former Deputy Secretary of State, called for wide-ranging changes in the department that sought to reduce some of the antagonism between the police and much of the city's population.   But Mr. White made a point of telling the jury: \\"The Los Angeles Police Department is not on trial here. Mayor Tom Bradley is not on trial here. Chief Gates is not on trial here.\\"   Mr. White portrayed Officer Powell, who is shown on the tape delivering most of the baton blows, as cavalier and brutal. \\"The only thing he told the truth about in this trial is when he spelled his name right,\\" the prosecutor said.   Mr. White also raised the issue of racial bias, referring to a computer message by Officer Powell before the beating in which he referred to a stakeout as \\"right out of 'Gorillas in the Mist.' \\"   \\"This is a racist statement\\" the prosecutor said. \\"You have to wonder what was his motive when he was beating Mr. King.\\" Prosecutor in Beating Case Urges Jury to Rely on Tape"},{"year":"1964","title":"SPRINGFIELD, Ill., Dec. 16 (UPI)&#8212","excerpt":"Theodore J.

Somewhat involuntarily, but with a chauffeur's own determination to see the thing through, he follows Brook Travers, the well known hero, to San Manaña to collect a taxi bill of $60 from him. There's a revolution going on in San Manaña, of course, and Biff is suspected of designs against the government. So, when he is captured, he is taken out by a squad of soldiers to be backed up against a wall and shot. But Biff can't understand Spanish and the commander of the squad can't understand American, at least not Biff's New Yorkese. Mistakes, therefore, are natural, and Biff gets the idea that he is being invited to join the San Manaña army. The ceremonies preliminary to the execution seem to him like an afternoon drill, and when they push him out in front so the squad can get a gun-length away from him he thinks he is being asked to take command.The scene is the ultimate of absurdification. Walter Long plays it with such heavy earnestness, and the soldiers are so helpless in their efforts to deal with a prisoner who can't be made to understand that his part in the proceedings is to be shot—it is one of the most robustious pieces of burlesque that has invigorated the Broadway screen for a long time. The present writer must confess that he does not recall whether the scene was in Richard Harding Davis's novel and play, or whether it was used in the screen version of \\"The Dictator\\" in which John Barrymore appeared some years ago, but he hazards the guess that, even if it is not new, it has never been better done than by Mr. Long and his associates.Nor is the new \\"Dictator\\" a one-scene production. The merrily executed execution scene, while one of the best things in the comedy, is really typical of the others. They are all well done. Wallace Reid, as the hero, is back at his farcing and this means that he is altogether enjoyable. Reid, the gay comedian, is worth a dozen of Reid, the romantic lover, and in \\"The Dictator\\" he is as gay as he has ever been.Much of the dash and spontaneity of the film is, of course, due to Walter Woods, the scenarist, and James Cruze, its director. These two have worked together in a number of productions and they almost invariably score, especially when permitted to have their own with a comedy. Their best picture remains \\"One Glorious Day,\\" but as a melodramatic burlesque, \\"The Dictator\\" comes to the front. It's the real thing.In addition to those mentioned, there are several others who add to what the trade calls the entertainment value of the piece, especially Lila Lee as the heroine for whom Wallace Reid wins the San Manañan Revolution","excerpt":"Theodore Kosloff, as the general of the revolutionary army, and Kalla Pasha as the temporary president, who is overthrown. Also, the cameraman and whoever designed the settings have done their part exceedingly well.So, although no picture is worth staying away from the Atlantic Ocean for, if you do remain in town this holiday week and find yourself with a free afternoon or evening you may be glad to know that there's at least an hour's joy in gelatin at the Rivoli.There is also another of the eye-and-ear pleasing Music Films at the same theatre, \\"Spanish Dance,\\" done by Martha Graham, and you may be amused by \\"Mountain Laurel,\\" a film which was made seriously in 1901 and is now revived with mocking subtitles. There is some doubt about the latter, however. The program is careful to state that the subtitles used are intended to turn \\"melodrama into burlesque,\\" and this is well, because, if they were not thus instructed how to take the film, spectators might not see the point in showing a picture in which the heroine wears old-fashioned clothes when there are so many others just like it in which the heroines are up to date.

First, last and always there is the tingling sight of Acapulco, Mexico, in color, where the actors, Ralph Meeker, Janice Rule and Paul Henreid (who also directed), must have had an idyllic, salaried time of it. Then, persistently, there is the quiet collective workmanship of these three people, and a good little supporting cast, in keep-ping a familiar, none-too-convincing plot respectable.Here, once more, is the one about the nice young bride who refuses to believe her husband is a psychopathic killer. As two American tourists, Miss Rule and Mr. Meeker, an artist, settle down in a beach cottage, and off he goes to sketch an island belle. This lady is found strangled, likewise a maid in the couple's household. It also evolves that Mr. Meeker's migraine headaches po??? to amnesia, shell-shock and a stretch in a Connecticut mental hospital.This is quite enough evidence for Mr. Henreid, as a very human police captain, but assuredly not for the loyal wife. And it is to the credit of this talented trio that the flaring melodramatics of the climax are not embarrassing.For if Robert Hill's scenario is as lean and compact as the picture's budget, it holds few surprises once the incidents unfold","excerpt":"there are a couple of ripe chances, too, in a pair of red herrings: the smiling wholesomeness of Mr. Meeker's general behavior (we witness no mayhem) and the brief, suspicious blandness of a native blackmailer (husband of one victim and paramour of the second).Mr. Henreid's direction can best be described as intelligent. Rosenda Monteros, Yerye Beirute and Carlos Riquelme are darned near perfect on the sidelines.As for the young stars of Broadway's \\"Picnic,\\" the more than capable Miss Rule and Mr. Meeker have yet to gain a firm foothold in pictures. And here still they mark time, but professionally so. (And isn't this about the third film psychopath for Mr. Meeker?)But oh, that lush Acapulco scenery! And surely someone, possibly producer John Bash, rates a handshake for combing the more unvarnished fringes of the place.

There is too much discrimination here.\\"   Francel Aguirre, a slightly built 27-year-old Ecuadorean, spoke quietly about his life as a member of the village of Ossining's largest group of new immigrants. He was surrounded by the friendly faces of fellow members of his English-as-a-second-language class, in the Ossining School District Office on Croton Avenue.    The village of Ossining has one of the largest concentrations of Ecuadoreans in the county","excerpt":"there are also growing populations in Croton-on-Hudson and Peekskill.   The teachers of English as a second language had organized a lunchtime party to celebrate their students' progress and allow them to share native foods. The 20 people included a man from Mexico City, a woman from Korea, a woman from Japan and a man from Bangladesh.    Mr. Aguirre said: \\"The different races cannot live together here. They must always stay apart. Ecuadoreans are victims of so many things, and we can say nothing. We don't do anything bad. We just work hard, and they give us a hard time.\\" Census Figures Analyzed    Outside the shelter of such institutions as the English-as-a-second-language classroom, Mr. Aguirre and his fellow Ecuadoreans say they are often victims of crime and discrimination.    According to 1990 census figures, the white population in the village of Ossining grew at a rate of 2 percent between 1980 and 1990. The population of nonwhites, as the census report puts it, grew by 44 percent, and the Hispanic population (which can be of any race) increased by 113 percent. By 1990, there were 3,692 Hispanic people in the village, whose population at that time was 22,582. Many village residents estimate that there are at least several thousand Ecuadoreans living and working in Ossining, legally or illegally, making them the largest group of recent immigrants in the village. Of the village's 22,000 or so residents, 4,350 in 1990 were foreign born.   Ossining Union Free School District statistics show that, as of last March, Ecuadorean children represented the largest immigrant group, with 35 newly arrived students in a school population of 3,281. The next largest groups were from Jamaica, Colombia, Peru, Portugal and Haiti.  Students who have lived in this country for longer than three years are not counted in the yearly school district new-immigrant census, so the actual number of immigrant students is much higher.   Officials at St. Ann's School, one of two Roman Catholic schools in Ossining, also say that their largest group of new immigrants is from Ecuador, with 11 children out of a total of 285 in the last school year.    But many Ecuadorean men come to Ossining without their families, work at transitory jobs in landscaping and construction and are uncounted. As large as the Ecuadorean population seems, it is hard to gauge without census designations more specific than \\"Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican and other Hispanic\\" and without children to be counted in the school census. There were 2,312 \\"other Hispanic\\" residents in the village, according to the census.   Like many of them, Mr. Aguirre left his parents, two brothers and a sister at home in Ecuador and has lived with his uncle and brother in an apartment near the Sing Sing Correctional Facility for five years. A baker who works nights, he said he had been denied a green card (the common name for the alien registration card), but he said he would try again.   The card is obtained when either a close family member is a legal resident or an employer files a petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service asking that the person be granted lawful permanent resident status. Some applications are processed quickly. Some are more complicated. Many illegal immigrants fall prey to fraudulent schemes promising a green card.    Mr. Aquirre said he was attacked while walking along Spring Street in the village. His attackers yelled, \\"Speak English!\\" before roughing him up, he said. He added that banks will not open accounts without Social Security numbers and that Ecuadoreans are frequently beaten and robbed for their savings, which they carry with them.    Anibal Gonzalez Jr., who is of Puerto Rican descent, is one of two Hispanic police officers in the village of Ossining who have tried to explain American life to the newest Spanish-speaking immigrants. He said, \\"If they're going to get into trouble, it's because they're drinking and then driving, or sometimes they wander into certain areas and guys will hassle them.\\"   Mr. Gonzalez added: \\"We see them with their pockets torn and their faces bloody, or the victims of a car crash, and they refuse medical care. They think the hospitals won't treat their emergency needs.    \\"Or they refuse to report a crime to us. They're afraid of being found out if they're here illegally and being deported. We try to straighten them out and tell them that they have to trust the system a little more.\\"    Reacting to the Ecuadoreans' fear of authority, Dr. Emil Nigro, director of emergency medicine at the Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in neighboring North Tarrytown, said, \\"We never, never turn anyone away.\\" He said that not only does his emergency room evaluate everyone who comes to them and treat them if needed but that it also does not require identification or insurance. Only a few simple questions are asked at admission and, Dr. Nigro added, \\"All records are confidential.\\" He added that in most cases hospitals must absorb the cost of emergency room visits by illegal aliens.   Diego Santiago, a Colombian-born police officer who lives in Ossining, has visited St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church on Eastern Avenue to tell Hispanic men how to protect themselves. St. Ann's is known as the immigrants' church in the community.   \\"Walk in groups, never alone,\\" Officer Santiago said. \\"Don't drink to drunkenness. Don't carry large amounts of cash. Don't be afraid of the police.\\" The Rev. Frank Oliverio has told these groups that they may feel free to keep their strongboxes with their savings in his rectory, just across the street from St. Ann's. About 350 Hispanic families attend the Spanish Masses at St. Ann's, but the church also offers special Masses in Italian, Portuguese and Korean. St. Ann's also serves many second- and third-generation Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans.    Father Oliverio said he hopes to form a support group for Ecuadoreans and other Hispanic men in this country without their families.    Not all Hispanic men are disillusioned. Luis Pani, a 31-year-old laborer, said he has never been assaulted. \\"Maybe that's why I'm so happy here,\\" he said. Although he has been unsuccessful in obtaining a green card, Mr. Pani, a bachelor, has formed a network of friends and made a life for himself in Ossining.  He has become active in St. Ann's Church and has become a familiar and popular figure in his English-as-a-second-language classes.    \\"America is a country of green fields, blue-eyed blond girls, wonderful summers and houses with green gardens and lawnmowers,\\" he said. \\"That is my dream, to have a house in the suburbs, a wife, a couple of kids and a lawnmower that can blow the leaves in the fall.\\"   Marcia Siguenza, an Ecuadorean who recently moved to North Tarrytown after nine years in Ossining, worries about the social havoc caused by the mostly male migration from Ecuador. \\"It is sad, very sad,\\" she said. \\"The men are coming to this country without their wives. Sometimes they remarry here, but it is not really a marriage. They do this because it helps them get a green card.    \\"It is breaking up the families in Ecuador. In some places in southern Ecuador, there are no men, only women. And there are bad men who are selling visas for too much, $4,000, which takes many years to pay off with interest.\\"    Ms. Siguenza, who has an Alien Registration Card, the so-called green card, is the supervisor of housekeeping at Kings College in Briarcliff. Her four grown children have done well in life, she said. But she said she failed to understand why so many young Ecuadorean men chose this country over their own. \\"They have a nice, simple life in Ecuador,\\" she said. \\"Maybe not with TV or cars. But there's too much here. It's a big transformation for them, and they're not really ready for it. They come mostly from the farms, from the countryside.\\"   Jose and Zoila Illescas have four children they left in Ecuador in the care of grandparents. The Illescases are both working, he in construction and she as a housecleaner. They have green cards and eagerly await the day they can afford to bring their children to the United States.  An Unofficial Protector    Carlos Castro, a constable and court officer, is a second-generation Colombian-American who has lived in Ossining for 25 years. He is an unofficial protector and adviser to the newest Hispanic immigrants who end up in the village courtroom. He said he is appalled by their living conditions. \\"Many homes have them stacked up inside,\\" Mr. Castro said.  \\"But you wouldn't know it from the street.\\"   Frank Vardy, an immigration authority from the New York City Department of City Planning, suggested that the Ecuadoreans are similar to the immigrant groups who preceded them. Those Ecuadoreans who choose to return to their native country are \\"much like the Italian 'birds of passage' from the late 1800's and early 1900's,\\" he said.   \\"Those men came and lived cheaply and sent money home to the wife and children,\\" Mr. Vardy said. \\"Then, after 5 or 10 years, they went home with a bankroll and bought a farm or opened up a business.\\"    Despite his steady job as a baker, Mr. Aguirre said he has been disillusioned and feels estranged. He added that he must continue working hard, living simply and watching his back if he is ever to be able to return home with anything to show for his time here.

No trouble impressing friends, family and headwaiters? O.K., then, try this:   Get someone -- someone equally knowledgeable -- to set up five wines, each from a different country or region, labels hidden. Taste. Then determine the following for each wine:   * Its grape variety or varieties.   * Its method of maturation.   * Its origin, including country, region and appellation.   * Its vintage.   * Its state of maturity.   * Its quality.   Joel Butler, who runs Prima, a combination Italian restaurant, wine bar and wine shop here, faced all those questions last year -- and many others like it -- when he became one of the first two Americans to win the title Master of Wine, awarded by the Institute of Masters of Wine in London. The other winner was Tim Hanni, public-relations director for Meridian Vineyards, a winery on the south central coast of California that is a subsidiary of Nestle S.A.   There are only 141 M.W.'s, as they call themselves, in the world. Last year, only 10 of the 50 candidates who \\"sat\\" the exam passed, and that 20 percent was a generous share: it was the first time more than 10 percent had passed. The annual examination lasts four days and includes written tests, tasting exercises, essays and an oral examination, much in the style of the exams at British universities.   Mr. Butler, who is 41 years old and has been involved with wine for nearly half of them, first took the M.W. examination in 1989. \\"I think I would have made it the first time,\\" he said, \\"but I was sick one day in the middle of it and that really throws you off.\\"   Here's another question from the 1990 exam:   Five wines are presented. Identify the origin of each wine, then: \\"Imagine that you are a retailer, having sold a bottle of each wine to a customer. What advice would you give so as to insure that each wine might be enjoyed to its best advantage?\\"   What prompts a grown man to undergo four days of such mental agony in London?   \\"All my years in the business, I've been reading about and looking up to these legendary wine people, Michael Broadbent, David Peppercorn, Serena Sutcliffe and others who are M.W.'s,\\" Mr. Butler said. \\"I realized that what they share is a strong theoretical background along with their practical experience. So many people involved in wine in this country are so superficial, even the wine writers.\\"     Mr. Butler, who is Prima's wine buyer, said it was a hard exam to study for. \\"Mostly it's knowledge you gain from reading, talking and experience,\\" he said. Even so, he pored over manuals and scientific books to prepare for technical questions like these:   How important is acidity in wine? What are the main types of acid to be found in grape must (juice) and in finished wine, and how can the acidity level be controlled in both?   Has his ascendancy to the wine elite changed Mr. Butler's life? Not much. Or at least not yet. \\"I get asked to more seminars, to judge at more wine competitions,\\" he said, \\"but that's about it.\\"   If anything, his goals are far removed from success in some commercial segment of the trade. \\"I enjoy the educational side,\\" he said, \\"teaching about wine, which I already do, in the extension program at Berkeley. And I'd like to write more","excerpt":"there are books to be done on California and Italy, among others.\\" Mr. Butler also grows grapes and makes wine at home.   Later this month he will preside over a tasting in San Francisco for aspiring candidates for the next Master of Wine exam, to be given in May. That tasting and an identical one in New York will be open only to candidates chosen from a much larger group who submitted essays on European and New World wine-making techniques. Only those who pass the tasting will be allowed to take the four-day series of tests in May. This year the tests will be given in New York and Sydney, Australia, the first time they have been administered outside London. Non-British candidates were not accepted until 1988.   Successful candidates like Mr. Butler and Mr. Hanni are not told which questions they answered correctly or what marks they achieved. In fact, none of the wine identity questions ask for the actual name of any wine. \\"What you say about the wines is more important than what, specifically, each one is,\\" Mr. Butler said.   Even so, he kept copies of the test questions and his answers, and the institute did name the wines used in the tasting questions. Here, for the record, are the five wines used in the first question above:   Turckheim riesling, grand cru, Brand Vineyard, 1988 (Alsace).   Nobilo Vintners sauvignon blanc, Hawkes Bay, 1988 (New Zealand).   Pewsey Vale Rhine riesling, Barossa Valley, 1987 (Australia).   Comte du Moulin Pouilly Fume, Tete de Cuvee, 1988 (Loire Valley).   Joseph Phelps Vineyards Johannisberg riesling, late harvest special selection, 1985 (Napa Valley).   How many of these wines Mr. Butler knew is his business. Suffice it to say that the judges liked what he said. TASTINGS Bourgogne Aligote, 1988, Domaine Jayer-Gilles; about $12. It wasn't too long ago when aligote, the \\"other\\" white wine of Burgundy, showed up almost exclusively in Kir, a bland aperitif made from creme de cassis and white wine. It was considered to acidic and too thin, lacking in body and fruit. The aligote, Burgundians told everyone, is a common grape that doesn't belong in the company of the noble chardonnay. All of the great whites of Burgundy are made from chardonnay, they noted, and none from aligote. So long as chardonnay was cheap, what was the difference? But that's no longer the case and forward-looking producers like Jayer-Gilles are discovering hitherto unnoticed qualities in the aligote grape. And why not? It's fresh, lively and quite stylish. This could probably be considered a companion piece to Jayer-Gilles's Passetoutgrains, a red wine from Burgundy that is a blend of pinot noir and gamay, which isn't truly Burgundy, but which deserves more attention at a time when Burgundy prices are so astonishingly high. The two wines represent a serious attempt within France to solve the Burgundy shortage and subsequent staggering prices. Both succeed rather well.

Although she has been a torch-singer, she has not forgotten the old copybook maxims, the legend of the grasshopper and the ants, and kindred pious sentiments dealing with the importance of being earnest. At her insistence Rodney goes to work for his father and, as may be expected, has a terrible time. Eventually, he plays truant. Abby discovers his defection and the marriage is over.The picture, naturally, does not end on this sour note, for the producers, probably in the interests of the NRA, bring Rodney to his senses and find him a new job.The story, as one may deduce from this summary, is not particularly important, but the dialogue is well handled, the photography and direction are able and the performances uniformly good. Those who saw the play will be disappointed in the film's treatment of Harold Sigrift, the character played on the stage by Alexander Woollcott. This Mr. Sigrift is a young man about town and not, as in the play, an obese sybarite with a flair for epigrams.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 13.    Now Playing    ''ARMAGEDDON,'' starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler. Directed by Michael Bay (PG-13, 144 minutes). This big, showy, spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a single heartfelt moment, unless you count its sequence set in a strip club. Imminent doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid) becomes the excuse for rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and a notion of heroism that has nothing whatever to do with real courage. Mr. Willis gets the film's noblest lines for the same reason that he probably got the set's biggest trailer. Mr. Affleck tries gamely to seem mad about Ms. Tyler, who serves as window-dressing at NASA headquarters. Totally predictable elements -- loud noises, frequent explosions and bright computer-screen colors -- seem as inevitable and deadly as the asteroid while they create the illusion of escapist fun (Janet Maslin).    ''DEEP IMPACT,'' starring Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni, Vanessa Redgrave and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mimi Leder (PG-13, 120 minutes). Apparently there is no better aid to family therapy than a murderously large meteor hurtling toward Earth. So this is a more sensitive sci-fi disaster film than most, with lovers bonding and old wounds healing as the summer's first colossal cinematic catastrophe looms. This thriller is vigorously made, but it provides less grisly mayhem than might be expected. As the planet faces extinction, attention is paid to rescuing art, antiques, elephants and flamingos. Special-effects wizardry provides a suitably devastating tidal wave (Maslin).    ''DR. DOLITTLE,'' starring Eddie Murphy. Directed by Betty Thomas (PG-13, 85 minutes). When this Dr. Dolittle talks to the animals, they pile on the back talk, thanks to the stellar cast of vocal talent (Ellen DeGeneres, Garry Shandling, Paul Reubens, John Leguizamo) that keeps the wisecracks flying. And Mr. Murphy plays straight man with hilarious aplomb. This good-humored family film is formulaic but steadily funny (and a lot less corrosive than ''The Nutty Professor''), thanks not only to Mr. Murphy's understated timing, but also to expertly computer-enhanced performances from the animal cast (Maslin).    ''GODZILLA,'' starring Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria and Maria Pitillo. Directed by Roland Emmerich (PG-13, 139 minutes). The ads for ''Godzilla'' proclaim that ''size does matter.'' But it turns out that bigger doesn't necessarily mean better. The animatronic lizard that rises from the ocean and stomps on a number of New York City landmarks has thundering metallic footsteps but still has the impact of a weightless cartoon monster. The movie doesn't get scary until halfway through, when the beast's eggs hatch (in what's left of Madison Square Garden) and an army of more lifelike baby Godzillas threatens to devour the search party. The storytelling and acting in this $120 million wad of gummed-up popcorn reaches new depths of crudeness and ineptitude for a so-called Event Movie (Stephen Holden).    ''GONE WITH THE WIND,'' starring Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia de Havilland, Leslie Howard and Hattie McDaniel. Directed by Victor Fleming (G, 220 minutes). There's still a lot of robust life left in this 1939 David O. Selznick adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's romantic novel of the Old South (possibly as it never existed) just before, during and after the Civil War. Not a great film but a satisfying one. The performances by Leigh, Gable and McDaniel are ravishing, and there's grandeur in the meticulous physical production. The movie shows its age most unfortunately in the uneven quality of the Technicolor prints, which, though new, go sort of pinkish more often than they should (Vincent Canby).    * ''HENRY FOOL,'' starring Thomas Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak and Parker Posey. Directed by Hal Hartley (R, 138 minutes). The affectless precision of this filmmaker's previous work is absolutely no preparation for the brilliance and deep resonance of this contemporary parable. Without forsaking the clean, spare look and hyperreal clarity that are his trademarks, Mr. Hartley moves into a much larger realm with a meditation on, among other things, art, trust, loyalty, politics and popular culture. When Henry Fool (Mr. Ryan) bursts mysteriously into the thankless life of Simon Grim (Mr. Urbaniak) and urges this silent garbage man to start writing, the results are strange and sublime. Ms. Posey plays Simon's slatternly sister with nonchalant wit in one of her best roles. A few glaringly scatological touches don't detract from the film's elegance of vision (Maslin).    ''HIGH ART,'' starring Ally Sheedy and Radha Mitchell. Directed by Lisa Cholodenko (R, 96 minutes). Ms. Sheedy gives a fierce, tricky performance in the role of a once-celebrated photographer, spooked by fame, who long ago retreated from the art world to live a reclusive, druggy life among lesbian friends. This steamily intense story follows her spider-fly relationship with Ms. Mitchell's bright-eyed, ambitious ingenue, who works for a desperately stylish photography magazine. Ms.  Cholodenko's seductive, powerfully atmospheric first feature explores their relationship with intelligence and avidity. But it sacrifices any hope of raw edges and real emotion to its own chic sensibility, which proves so studiously alluring that it overwhelms the story. Patricia Clarkson does a scene-stealing turn as Ms. Sheedy's lover, a glamorously decadent German actress who never got past the Fassbinder years (Maslin).    * ''THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO,'' starring Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Whit Stillman (R, 112 minutes). Mr. Stillman's smart, fretful, patrician characters turn up midway between ''Metropolitan'' and ''Barcelona'' in a film that charmingly mixes post-college career worries with improbable discomania. A delightful cast engages in nonstop flirtation and hair-splitting debate, rendered with Mr. Stillman's usual acuity and humor. Ms. Beckinsale, an English actress with a flawless American accent here and diffidence that's just as perfect, holds court beguilingly at the center of a bright and amusing crowd. The ideal film for anyone willing to entertain the notion that the spread of environmentalism was sparked by the revival of ''Bambi'' during the disco generation's formative years (Maslin).    ''MULAN,'' with the voices of Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy and B. D. Wong. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (G, 86 minutes). Disney takes a sledgehammer to the subject of gender stereotyping in this film, which not only breaks the cross-dressing barrier but also ratchets up the violence level for children's animation. This is the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney animated films, right down to the jokey sidekicks, would-be ''Under the Sea'' production number and Destiny ballad from the intrepid heroine (''When will my reflection show who I am inside?''). Mr. Murphy's very funny wisecracks make the character of a little dragon entertaining, but this black-sounding character is also treated as a servile clown. The animation mimics live-action crowd scenes more often than it takes audiences to the realm of the imagination (Maslin).    * ''THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,'' starring Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan, Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100 minutes). Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully acerbic comedy finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from nasty little Wednesday of ''The Addams Family'' into Lolita's evil twin. Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this film and announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart of gold.  Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally skewers preconceptions about gay and straight life, then lets its characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Mr. Donovan and Ms. Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery, deliver the zingers from Mr. Roos's screenplay with deadpan panache (Maslin).    * ''OUT OF SIGHT,'' starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 120 minutes). As directed with terrific panache by Mr. Soderbergh in his most frankly commercial effort, Mr. Clooney and Ms. Lopez take an intricate Elmore Leonard crime tale and give it steam heat. Like ''Get Shorty,'' this story has been adapted from a Leonard novel by Scott Frank, who knows exactly how to capture the writer's shrewd, hard-boiled style on screen. An outstanding supporting cast -- including Don Cheadle, Dennis Farina and Albert Brooks -- provides the movie with a vivid rogues' gallery and remains good fun even when the story is occasionally confusing. To fill in the blanks, go back to Mr. Leonard's version","excerpt":"there are certainly worse ways to spend a summer afternoon (Maslin).    * ''A PERFECT MURDER,'' starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Andrew Davis (R, 107 minutes). The characters may be cardboard-thin in this film, a skillfully plotted update of Frederick Knott's play (and Alfred Hitchcock's film) ''Dial M for Murder,'' but the nasty cat-and-mouse games they play are icily amusing. Mr. Douglas, looking more than ever like a wattled, riled-up rooster, is Steven Taylor, a shady Wall Street bond trader in deep financial trouble who hires his rich wife's handsome lover (Mr. Mortensen), a con man posing as a painter, to murder her. It's not as easy as he hopes. Ms. Paltrow, looking chic, is the wife, Emily, a translator at the United Nations, who has her own agenda. The story takes enough surprising twists to keep you engrossed, and the high-style ambiance (especially the Taylors' Fifth Avenue apartment) is mouthwatering (Holden).    ''SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS,'' starring Anne Heche and Harrison Ford. Directed by Ivan Reitman (PG-13, 146 minutes). This escapist romance for the Treadmill Generation is a workout in its own right, putting its stars through the wringer (and into a ''From Here to Eternity'' surf clinch complete with hiking boots). The leads are attractive and funny, and the screenplay strives for a Tracy-Hepburn dynamic, but this truly strenuous love story is as long on tropical scenery as it is short on new ideas. Once the stars are marooned in splendid isolation, the film has to cook up pirates and a snake in Ms. Heche's shorts just to keep afloat. In supporting roles, David Schwimmer makes a drippy beau for Ms. Heche; Temuera Morrison deserves his own pirate picture, and the ex-grocery clerk Jacqueline Obrados torches up the film as if Salma Hayek were in town (Maslin).    * ''THE TRUMAN SHOW,'' starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed Harris. Directed by Peter Weir (PG, 104 minutes). The ultimate in high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas and cartwheels for this ingenious media-age fantasy are over the top, but by comparison with Hollywood's usual notion of summer movie fare, it's definitely a dazzler. Mr. Carrey, refreshingly free of shtick, gives an instantly iconic performance as a guinea pig for an entertainment-happy nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud contrived by Mr. Harris's so-called ''televisionary.'' Mr. Carrey's innate edge of volatility gives the material, from a screenplay of transfixing sci-fi intensity, its trace of danger. Ms. Linney, as the actress playing a wife whose bluff could be called at any moment, is the story's spookiest character as well as its perkiest. Mr. Weir unifies the story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin).    ''THE X-FILES,'' starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson. Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 115 minutes). Conspiracy theorists, consider this: what if the hush-hush atmosphere and Internet mania surrounding the first ''X-Files'' feature film were part of a giant scheme to hide the uneventfulness of a summertime sci-fi fizzle? It's as possible as much of what this spinoff film has to offer. If devotees of the television series approach the film with enough baggage for a six-week safari, maybe they can deepen the experience of watching a middling action-adventure with brand-name appeal. But this film will strike true X-fanatics as watered down and remains fairly bewildering to the uninitiated. And no, Scully and Mulder don't quite take their working relationship to a higher plane (Maslin).    Film Series    ''UNIVERSAL COMEDY.'' Four weeks, 21 films and countless laughs. That's the prospect beginning today at the Film Forum, where the series ''Universal Comedy'' brings classics of the genre starring Mae West, W. C. Fields, the Marx Brothers and Abbott and Costello and directed by masters of the merry like Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges. Other highlights include a Rock Hudson-Doris day twin bill and James Stewart in ''Harvey.'' Many of the films are in new 35-millimeter prints, including the opening attraction, a double-barreled blast of Mae West, playing through Sunday: ''She Done Him Wrong'' (1933) and ''I'm No Angel'' (1933), both with Cary Grant and immortal lines like ''come up and see me sometime.'' The series continues through Aug. 6 at the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, in the South Village. Admission: $8.50; $4.50 for members. Information: (212) 727-8110 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

True Balsamic    There are many products called balsamic vinegar that are pale shadows of the real thing. True balsamic vinegar, made in Italy in the area around Modena and Reggio nell'Emilia, is dark, mellow and viscous, with none of the harshness of the cheaper kinds. It also costs $150 or more for a 3.3-ounce bottle.   Now, one importer, Rogers International, has introduced a less expensive balsamic vinegar made in Modena by Malpighi. It is aged for only 12 years, the minimum accepted by the consortium of producers.   This balsamic vinegar is not quite as concentrated as the older kind. But for the price -- less than $100 for 3.3 ounces -- it is far superior to cheaper varieties that are not made in the slow traditional fashion. The Malpighi vinegar is sold at Balducci's, 464 Avenue of the Americas (at Ninth Street), and Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue (at 71st Street), for $75. At the Hay Day Market in Scarsdale, N.Y., and its Connecticut branches in Ridgefield, Greenwich and Westport, it is $69.99. Blossom Time    Fishkill Farms, Lime Kiln Road in Hopewell Junction, N.Y., will hold its annual apple blossom festival on Saturday from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M.

The James Beard Foundation and Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust, two educational organizations, are the sponsors, and there is no charge for admission. Off the Menu Three Years for a Subway?    Sometimes the subway you want takes a long time to come. But how about never?    Three years ago, Ellen Hart Sturm bought an antique New York subway car from the Transit Museum in Brooklyn, for which she paid $3,100. She was planning to use it as the facade for a new restaurant. While the restaurant was being built, she tried to arrange delivery of her subway car, but it was nowhere to be found.    So a fake subway car was created for the facade of her new restaurant, Ellen's Stardust Diner at 1650 Broadway (at 51st Street). Ms. Hart, who held the title of Miss Subways in 1959, also owns Ellen's Stardust Diner at 1377 Avenue of the Americas (at 56th Street). Bistro in Flux    Changes are being made at Le Comptoir, 227 East 67th Street. The restaurant will continue to serve French bistro food, but the menu will be changed because Jean-Michel Bergougnoux, until recently the chef at Restaurant Raphael, has become the chef. Mr. Bergougnoux and his partner, Jean Denoyer, have yet to decide on a new name for their new restaurant.    \\"But we are not touching the decor,\\" Mr. Bergougnoux said. A wise move. Le Comptoir may be one of the prettiest French bistros on either side of the Atlantic. A Review but No Name    Many restaurant reviewers try desperately to remain anonymous when on the job. Women wear wigs. Men grow beards. But the restaurant reviewer for The New Yorker may have the easiest time of it. Restaurant reviews, in a short column called \\"Tables for Two\\" introduced in the May 1 issue in the \\"Goings On About Town\\" section, did not include the name of the reviewer. Craig Seligman, who edits \\"Goings On About Town,\\" said the reviewer was Kate Sekules, who is English and has written guidebooks about London and New York. When asked why the review was unsigned, he said, \\"Nothing in 'Goings On' is signed, except the movie reviews.\\" The first review was of First, a restaurant in the East Village. Mr. Seligman said he expected restaurant reviews to run every other week. Shrinking Prices    Frank Valenza has been nipping away at the prices at Two Two Two, his restaurant at 222 West 79th Street, which serves contemporary American food. A few weeks ago, he introduced a Sunday prix-fixe dinner for $24.50, about the price of the average main course on the a la carte menu. Now, he will offer the prix-fixe dinner Sundays through Thursdays until July 1, when it will be available every night until Labor Day.

Why, pray tell, have a number of respected American independent distributors like Miramax filed expensive lawsuits in the past year to have X ratings of high-quality films like Almodovar's \\"Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!\\" overturned? And why did the distributors of Wayne Wang's \\"Life Is Cheap . . . but Toilet Paper Is Expensive\\" advertise their film in The Times with their own A rating rather than the Motion Picture Association of America's X rating?   The answer is simply economic. For better or worse, an X rating has become synonymous with pornographic, and, just as The New York Times does not carry ads for sexually explicit films, many theaters around the United States will not show films rated X. If the recent campaign for a change in the ratings system is any indication, most American independent distributors (not to mention film artists) find an X rating extremely bad for business","excerpt":"there are even some who suspect that the many X ratings given to American and foreign independents by the M.P.A.A. are part of a general Hollywood effort (strenuously denied by M.P.A.A. head Jack Valenti, of course) to drive the independents out of the American film marketplace.   Seen in this light, the NC-17 rating given to Universal's \\"Henry and June\\" (after a number of independents had failed to persuade Mr. Valenti to change the system) is proof that Hollywood itself believes that an X rating is bad for business. Indeed, it is hard to imagine any pundit in the American motion picture industry agreeing with Ms. Maslin's astounding assertion that \\"the idea that an X is bad for business only makes sense when it comes to big-budget films that are destined for multiple shopping malls.\\"   As an independent film maker who has watched American independent film production dwindle to near extinction, thanks to the vertical integration of the Reagan era, I feel that the future of the American independent film is worthy of serious debate.

This yachty town, home of the United States Naval Academy and some of the world's finest racing sloops, is a 45-minute trip from Washington or Baltimore and is full of weekend houses, both in the charming town and on the waterfront. It is a gateway to Maryland's Eastern Shore, and house prices -- already high -- have really started to soar.    GUILFORD, CONN. Less than an hour south of Hartford and about 15 minutes east of New Haven, Guilford has one of the prettiest village greens in Connecticut. From the center of Guilford, it's about five minutes to Stony Creek and the little launch that transports you around the Thimble Islands. But buying a shorefront cottage or an 18th-century center-chimney colonial on one of the quiet side streets of the town has almost as much cachet as a house on one of the islands -- and it's so much easier to get to in winter. Plenty of New Yorkers have weekend houses in Guilford, too -- it's only about a two-hour drive from Times Square.    GALVESTON ISLAND, TEX. If you're a fisherman, Galveston is just the right place for spending a relaxing day at the end of a pier -- with dozens of fellow enthusiasts. But this island -- popular long before Houston was, and just a hair less than an hour away -- is a place for partying, too. The town plays host to the annual Beach Party Weekends (with its 32 miles of beaches, it's not hard to find an empty spot). The island has a choice of rambling Victorians and spanking new condominiums.    LAKE MINNETONKA, MINN. A quick 50-minute ride from downtown St. Paul, Lake Minnetonka has been a vacation spot since the mid-19th century, hitting its heyday in the 1880's and 1890's, when steamboats plied its waters and women in huge feathered hats walked its boardwalks and checked into the grand lakeside hotels. Today, the area is full of moccasin shops, but also music and poetry festivals and lake cruises. There are many lakeside communities, including the delightfully named Wayzata, Excelsior, Long Lake and Mound -- with houses of every description and price.    NAPA, CALIF. If San Francisco, with its streetcars and famous hills, is too exciting to spend seven days a week there, take a 45-minute drive to your minichateau in the southern part of the country's most famous wine district.

A football star in high school and college, Roscoe's pro career was cut tragically short by a knee injury. After a few tours as a professional wrestler, he returns to his home town of Union City, Ohio, where football memories are long and he is still a minor local hero. He marries, opens a bar and settles into a life of vague dissatisfaction, plagued by his regret over the stardom he never achieved. As his 40th birthday approaches, he is not willing to admit that at some stage of his life    too late    becomes a simple truth and not a fear. He prepares to make a comeback with a local football team, leaves his wife and has an affair with an old lover. Amid this spate of irresponsible behavior, his lover's son is arrested for a murder he did not commit and Roscoe, not knowing quite why, determines to ferret out the truth of what happened. In so doing, he recognizes the cowardice and lying endemic to the declining black community of Union City and begins to assume greater responsibility for reversing that decline. Roscoe will always dream big dreams, but with the ghost of his own murdered father looking over his shoulder, he begins to devote his fantasies to family and unity and quieter heroics.

Siegel wince every time they hear another story about the risks of doing business in the former Soviet Union. It only makes it that much more difficult to convince potential investors that gambling itself, specifically their enterprise of running instant lotteries, stands a good chance of hitting the jackpot.   \\"I've never seen a region so accepting of such activities","excerpt":"there are no moral or legal inhibitions,\\" said Mr. Scheer, a 63-year-old Brooklyn native whose resume includes 15 years with the Bally Manufacturing Corporation marketing slot machines and other gambling products in America, Australia and Asia. \\"This could be a $1 billion business in five years,\\" he added. 20 Million Tickets Sold    That sounds like an unbelievable annual take from a collection of states currently riven by conflict and poverty, not to mention being tangled in bureaucracy and corruption that routinely undermines the investment strategies of the world's most powerful multinational corporations.   But Mr. Scheer and Mr. Siegel, who set up the International Lottery and Gaming Corporation here about a year ago, say they have already managed to sell nearly 20 million tickets in 150 communities in the former Soviet Union. And their market projection is conservative, says the 50-year-old Mr. Siegel, who is International Lottery's president, chief operating officer and landlord (his suburban Chicago home is the company headquarters).    \\"To put it in perspective, the Illinois Lottery gets $1.5 billion from a population of 12 million, or about $2 per person per week,\\" Mr. Siegel said. \\"We figure on getting the equivalent of 4 cents per person per week.\\"   The story of how two entrepreneurs got this far -- and where they dream of going -- might dismay those who believe that the struggling former Communist states need innovative gambling about as much as they need cancer-promoting Western cigarettes. But it also provides a revealing glimpse of the power of Western-style marketing and the way in which skillful business people can find opportunities where corporate giants sometimes struggle.    International Lottery advertises unique prizes, like trips to the United States or electronic goods, that are otherwise hard to obtain in many of the areas where its tickets are sold. And although fewer than 2 percent of players win a prize worth more than their tickets, which cost from about 25 cents to $1, two-thirds of the tickets win something, compared with about one-fourth in a typical instant-winner American state lottery. The percentage of the proceeds paid out, about 50 percent, is about average for an American lottery.   The International Lottery tickets that do not win a prize still have a residual value as coupons that can be redeemed, albeit in large quantities, for small items like toothbrushes. The Beginning    International Lottery is 51 percent owned by International Business and Communications Inc., a privately held television, telecommunications and trading concern in Los Angeles headed by Robert Block, whom Mr. Scheer knew from his Bally days. Mr. Block called Mr. Scheer when one of his subsidiaries was asked by Russian partners to help set up television-based lotteries and game shows in the Russian city of Tyumen.   Mr. Scheer, who had just sold a gambling-technology business developed with Mr. Siegel to the Gaming Group in Los Angeles, quickly concluded that the region's telecommunications and distribution infrastructure was too unreliable for such a venture. But Mr. Scheer was convinced that a lottery business could be built by starting with simpler instant-winner ticket games, and he quickly recruited Mr. Siegel.   \\"It's theirs to run,\\" Mr. Block said.    International Lottery and Gaming chose Chelyabinsk, a formerly closed city at the base of the Ural Mountains in the heart of Russia's electronics region, as the headquarters for a test run of two million tickets. The local partners, owning 50 percent of the venture, were led by the Globx-Urals Medical and Health Company, a hospital designated by the provincial government to represent its interests and receive a portion of the proceeds.   Even before the experiment was finished, International Lottery had embarked on similar joint ventures with influential local groups across the region. Its partner in Belarus is the state railroad; in Armenia, the powerful teachers' union; in Latvia, a large publisher, and in St. Petersburg, a local manufacturer run by a former district attorney. In Uzbekistan, the local ownership group includes the state bank.   The local partners were not the only ones impressed by International Lottery's plans. Last spring, Mr. Scheer and Mr. Siegel chartered a jet and took a group of officials from Philips N.V., the big consumer electronics company in the Netherlands, to several cities. Mr. Scheer and Mr. Siegel, in return for featuring Philips products as prizes, wanted Philips to help outfit ticket redemption centers where prize winners could look through catalogues and trade up for more expensive products like television sets and compact disk players or buy goods on their own.   \\"What we saw was more or less what they said,\\" said J. H. Van Zijl, the Philips regional manager who signed a preliminary agreement to test the concept in Chelyaminsk and Gomel, a city in Belarus. \\"They had the contacts. If certain volumes are reached, we'll nominate their local people as nonexclusive agents.\\" Links to Retailing    Philips sees the arrangement as an unorthodox but potentially attractive way to accelerate its penetration of the former Soviet Union. International Lottery sees the relationship with Philips as a way to show other potential partners how retailing could be linked to the lotteries' sales and distribution network.   International Lottery has invested more than $2 million so far, according to Mr. Scheer. It says it has employed more than 20,000 people, most as sales personnel who get a 10 percent commission. Some of the lotteries provide a portion of their revenue to the local police to use in buying equipment, to hospitals for medicine and to charities. International Lottery expects its own cut of the proceeds will average at least 10 percent.    Much of the $2 million investment will be lost though unless International Lottery gets the new capital needed to continue growing. As other businesses have, International Lottery has found that getting money out of the region is not a straightforward process. Revenues were returned from Uzbekistan by way of a deal in which International Lottery bought Soviet tractors that the Uzbekis wanted but had not been able to obtain, then traded them for Uzbeki cotton purchased with lottery revenues. The cotton was sold for rubles which were then converted to dollars.   Mr. Scheer and Mr. Siegel are not the only entrepreneurs out to cash in on the escapist fantasies of the beleaguered citizens of the former Soviet Union. Global Casinos Inc., a publicly traded company based in Dallas, has opened casinos in Kyrgyzstan and Sochi, a Russian vacation town on the Black Sea, and has others under construction in Russia and Belarus. Capital to develop the entertainment and gambling market is also pouring in from Europe. Some Worries    Some experts warn that the explosion in gambling, apparently driven in part by local mobsters, contains the seeds of its own destruction. \\"A political backlash is building,\\" said Stephen F. Cohen, director of Russian studies at Princeton University.   So far, though, there is no sign of that in the lottery sector, where International Lottery's main competitors are old-line state-run games that have a reputation for being both rigged and staid. \\"Russians tell us the commissar's daughter always seems to win,\\" Mr. Scheer said.   Mr. Scheer says security has not been a problem to date, in part because several lotteries make donations to local police forces. To avoid any possibility of corruption in the ticket printing process, International Lottery has all tickets printed at a plant in Bellwood, Ill., that handles similar jobs for American lotteries.   \\"You may have to give a forklift operator a few rubles to get the tickets off the plane quickly but we really haven't had to pay anyone off,\\" Mr. Siegel said. \\"If our partners are doing anything like that, we don't support it and we don't know about it.\\" Giving Russians a Taste of Jackpots"},{"year":"2005","title":"Holland Cotter reviews group show, homage to Allan Kaprow, at Silo gallery (M) Art in Review","excerpt":"There are no more Allan Kaprows in the art world"},{"year":"1991","title":"The rear flap of an airplane wing is going through its paces on a computer screen in response to instructions keyed in by Lawrence D.

This is, of course, a role that does not allow for the show of wanton animalism upon which her popularity has been built.In \\"Mam'zelle Pigalle,\\" Miss Bardot, as this teen-ager who has a crush on a French crooner, played rather stolidly by Jean Bretonniere, acts all right and even dances with a neat little step. But, as we say, because of the kind of role she plays the film never delivers what the mere name of Bardot suggests—the fulsome and ripe female who finally flings aside her inhibitions.Nor does the picture, which is in color and wide-screen, really deliver very much in any other direction, despite the fact that it is a big production by French standards. It is full of slapstick and clumsy farce, and some oldish and splashy dance numbers. But it never piles up its effects in any one direction. Instead it keeps shifting key, from romance to melodrama to light comedy, back and forth. It presents nothing that can take the place of a serious study of Miss Bardot's form.Early in the film we see Miss B. in the Bikini, but that's about it","excerpt":"there are no toppers along the way. Instead we are treated to one of those labored little plots where the girl is forced to live at the apartment of the crooner because some counterfeiters are using her papa's night club as a blind for their operations.There are some bumbling policemen rung in for laughs, and some embarrassments for the crooner when his professorial girl friend finds Miss B. There is also the prudish butler who fears she might have fleas. It's all about that clear and about that funny.The direction by Michael Boisrond seems rather fuzzy about whether or not \\"Mam'zelle Pigalle\\" should be a broad take-off on a Hollywood romantic melodrama. At the end, however, it seems this was the intention. The crooks are captured in a free-for-all that is so broad and silly that it gives up all pretense to a straight face.There are some tongue-in-cheek little jokes in the script by M. Boisrond and Roger Vadim. At other times the tongue is stuck right out. When all is said and done, Miss B. is seen as a mother wedded to the crooner, complete with baby and bassinet.

Written in Jack London's best pulpwood style, with Lyn Harding playing the bucko mate, Paul Lukas as the supercargo and a beautifully chosen crew of cutthroats aboard, the saga of the Elsinore makes bully screen reading, especially if you've a taste for a blustering yarn. It has pace, suspense, excitement—that galore—but, beyond all these, it has grand photography.Mutiny is always exciting. The very word is exciting. But the most exciting part of the mutiny on the Elsinore is the way the camera has seen a fine old three-master under a full head of sail. There isn't much process work here. The Elsinore is a real ship, and she is plowing across a real ocean, not tossing in a studio tank. The camera men have studied her from every vantage point, from the decks up through her rigging, from the masthead as she plunges through a storm, from a lifeboat as she hove-to for a man overboard","excerpt":"there are not many things, ashore or afloat, more richly deserving of study, not many so thrilling to see.The yarn they're spinning is like most tales of mutiny: the captain murdered, the first mate shot down, the second officer in league with the trouble-makers in the crew, the supercargo and the skipper's daughter left to fight it out. But there is nothing formular about the rest of it, with its shrewd interplay of well-told incident, its richness of characterization. Messrs. Harding and Lukas do well enough as the heroes of the occasion, but the real heroes of the piece are its villains— Michael Martin-Harvey as the sea lawyer, Ben Soutten as the rascally second mate, William Devlin as the mad O'Sullivan. They act as though they believed Jack London really could tell a sea story. He could.Parties to Honor Two ActorsArthur Byron, president of Actors Equity, who is appearing in \\"Jeremiah,\\" will be the guest of honor next Tuesday night at a backstage party in the Guild Theatre to be given by the guild and members of the cast in celebration of his fiftieth anniversary as an actor.

Mil ton Katselas's staging is most striking and Peter Wexler's most beautiful setting not only uses the Beaumont Theater better than ever before but pro vides the visual accompani ment to the fantasy. Jes sica Tandy is quite mar velous as Camille and I ad mired equally Clifford David as Byron and Philip Bosco as Charlus. This is a lovely play, a play of gen uinely poetic vision.&#8221; For Walter Kerr, see Page 1.

One of these shows is in the Municipal Art Society's Urban Center, 457 Madison Avenue, at 51st Street (935-3960), where color photographs depict the Brooklyn Bridge in many aspects of its splendor.

Gordon Bunshaft, the Pritzker Prize-winning architect best known for Lever House on Park Avenue, designed it to be his own home in 1962. The Museum of Modern Art was willed the house in 1994 and sold it a year later to Martha Stewart. But the one-story glass-and-marble building may have met its final owner. Donald Maharam, who recently bought the house from Ms. Stewart's daughter, Alexis, said that he had ''all sorts of ugly'' on his hands, and he planned to tear the house down.    Martha Stewart hired the British architect John Pawson to renovate the house in the 1990's, but the work was never completed. ''It was gutted and in no condition to be restored,'' said Mr. Maharam, who is retired from his family's textile business. ''There's not a single standing wall inside","excerpt":"there are plants growing inside.'' Indeed, just over a week ago the structure was an empty shell with a dirt floor and plywood standing in for two of three floor-to-ceiling windows (as seen at right, above; at left, the house in happier days). But the massive marble walls and prestressed concrete roof with its distinctive clerestory windows evidently were largely intact, as was a new foundation added by Mr. Pawson.    Mr. Maharam said he planned to put up a new building ''in the spirit of the former house, using the same footprint.'' The waterfront facade would be ''exactly the same,'' he said, although primarily glass where Bunshaft had used glass and travertine marble. David Pill, a Boston architect who will design it, said he hoped to ''keep the spirit of a modernist structure alive.''    But not everyone accepts the premise that the old house was beyond repair. ''I just don't believe that,'' said Michael Gotkin of the Modern Architecture Working Group, a preservationist organization. ''You can preserve any house if you really want to. This one was built solidly of stone and glass.'' He added, ''It's the only house by an architect famous for skyscrapers, and it shows his thinking at a small scale.'' The 2,300-square-foot house's scale, he said, was ''maybe too small for today's Hamptons.''    Mr. Pawson, who visited the property last August, said that a reconstruction could still be possible: ''Everything that we'd taken out was due to be put back. What was left was either stone or steel or glass, nothing that would have deteriorated. Travertine lasts.''    Mr. Pawson pointed out that the landscaping of the property was also central to Bunshaft's work: ''He built the land up from the water almost a story higher, to create a fantastic view of the flat water of the Georgica Pond and the rough water of the sea beyond. He built himself one of the best settings on Long Island.'' On that much, he and Donald Maharam might agree. ''We bought a great piece of property,'' Mr. Maharam said. ''We didn't buy a house.''

The original in Rahway, which is nine years old, is little more than a store selling Japanese food and housewares, with a sushi bar and a few tables for diners (primarily Japanese). Small though it is, it has a liquor license. \\n\\nJo-Sho in the Somerset County community of Somerset is just a few months old, and the opposite in almost every way from the original. It is most attractive, from a small stone garden inside the entrance, to the tatami rooms for private dining. There is a sushi bar here also, and the regular dining room has small, pleasant tables.\\n\\n But the tatami rooms (used primarily for celebrations in Japan) are the most interesting. They are small, with a low central table over a cavity in the floor to accomodate diners' legs. There is a telephone in each room, set on a small cushion and covered with a square of cloth to hide the implement. This is used to call the waitress when necessary. Shoes are left outside the room","excerpt":"there are small slippers that diners can wear if they need to leave the tatami room.\\n\\n There is no liquor license here, but diners may bring sake, to be served warm or cold depending on the type, or beer or whisky. Any of these beverages, or plain tea, seem to go well with Japanese food. An average meal of an appetizer and main course, which includes soup, salad and rice, is $22. Use of the tatami room is $5.50 a person, a minimum of four people.\\n\\n Service by the waitresses, in kimonos, was very slow and several things had to be requested twice, but they were polite and pleasant.\\n\\n As for the food, we fared better when there were Japanese diners in the party. Without a Japanese escort, we were often told that \\"Americans like this,\\" as a dish was suggested. Or a question about a preparation would draw this response: \\"You wouldn't like it. Only Japanese like this.\\" In fact, we strongly suspect that if we had dined only with Japanese guests, the rating might be higher.\\n\\n As it was, the food was generally delightful. Although the menu is divided into appetizers (including sushi) and entrees, it is possible to eat a meal made up of many small dishes.\\n\\n These could include freshwater eel (unagi) with Japanese pickles topped with seaweed (tsekemono); bean sprouts with thin sliced pork served cold in a vinegar, soy and sesame marinade (moyashi); ground raw yellowtail mixed with chopped scallions and seasonings (hamachitataki); vinegared shrimp, octopus, cockles, vegetables and seaweed (sunomo); snails steamed in soy sayce; firm, buttery steamed shitake mushrooms; greaseless fried oysters; crispy fried chicken Japanese style (tatsutaage), and salmon roll. The last-named was pieces of samon (with skin) rolled around vegetables, dipped in batter and deep-fried.\\n\\n Skewered marinated grilled chicken, called yakitori, was dry on three occasions, and the little steamed pot of savory egg custard with fish and vegetables was watery. Grilled eggplant was dissapointing because fat American eggplant was used instead of the thin, less watery and better flavored Japanese eggplant.\\n\\n Sashimi (raw fish) was perfectly fresh, well cut and of good variety. But although the sushi (vinegared rice with fish) was of equal quality in freshness, the variety (when ordered as a dish instead of individually) was limited to the most common and perhaps the most popular items. This may be because we did not sit at the sushi bar, which is usually where the best sushi is found.\\n\\n Main-course recommendations include fried pork with fried potato cakes (tonkatsu); a salmon stew with vegetables, tofu and white gelatin-like noodles (nabe), and, when in season, roast yellowtail neck, in which the skin was slightly crusty with the salt and the fish inside was soft and buttery. A dish of light, exquisitely prepared fish, huge shrimp and a variety of vegetables and leaves, called shiso, dipped in batter and deep-fried (tempura) was excellent.\\n\\n Thin slices of ginger pork were bland; beef rolled around scallions was tough, and salmnon teriyaki was cut into cubes and the juices had totally escaped. In the shabu-shabu (which is like a Mongolian hot pot), the vegetables were lacking in variety and presentation, although the rather fatty meat was fine.\\n\\n\\n Jo-Sho\\n\\n Very Good\\n\\n\\n 270 Cedar Grove Lane (off Easton Avenue), Somerset (201) 469-8969\\n\\n Atmosphere: Charming modern Japanese decor with a sushi bar and tatami rooms.\\n\\n Recommended dishes: Snails, sunomo, beef sashimi, sashimi, sushi, unagi, moyashi, fried oysters, salmon roll, steamed shitake mushrooms, salmon nabe, fried yellowtail neck, hamachitataki, tatsutaage, tonkatsu, tempura.\\n\\n Price range: Appetizers, $4 to $8; main courses $9.50 to $24.\\n\\n Hours: Lunch, Monday through Saturday, 11:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M.

When his beloved Sister Maria seems suspect of stealing a 1,000-shilling note, little Toni shoulders the blame. If that were all, the script would be as banal as this outline. Fortunately there is more: the refreshing simplicity of the choir boy's performance, the delicacy with which director and cameraman have recorded the poignant emotional crises in a boy's life and the deftness of the grown-ups' portrayals.Little Toni is the hero of the piece, but credit is due, also, to plump Julia Janssen as Sister Maria, to Ferdinand Meyerhofer for his benign Rector, to Hans Olden for his impudent Blueml, and to the choristers—to tiny Hansi in particular—not merely for their singing, but for their honest, unspoiled portraits of little men.

Luckily, however, that eminent brain specialist and dabbler in mental suggestion, Godfrey Tearle, is aboard.Director Bernard Vorhaus has made use of the Grand Hotel formula as the cameras move from compartment to compartment, first, second and third class, permitting the audience to watch a dozen minor dramas that unfold during that climactic train ride.

Out front in the locomotive the engineer, bent on destroying the train and all its burden, and the fireman battle out their own private fight, until the fireman escapes to bring the brain specialist and his soft, hypnotic powers to the rescue.There are some engaging directorial touches, and there is some excellent photography. The experienced members of the cast, like Tearle, Hugh Williams, Judy Gunn, Frank Pettingell and Eliot Makeham, give adequate performances in not-too-difficult rôles.

Why is there no construction at a prime assembled site overlooking Ward Parkway, the Park Avenue of Kansas City?

In one sequence, however, the director, Wesley Ruggles, succeeds in being ingenious, and that is when Miss La Plante, as Joyce Bragdon, is endeavoring to prevent the marriage of her favorite physician. How to stop the ceremony which is taking place aboard a houseboat is a question which is answered by Joyce with no small degree of originality. She decides to irritate the bride-to-be, the doctor and the minister. This she accomplishes by making a catapult out of a pair of curling tongs and a garter and shooting pearls at the three persons. Of course it could never happen anywhere but on the screen. Nevertheless, it aroused some laughter in the big playhouse yesterday afternoon.Miss La Plante has chosen a rôle (or the producers have chosen it for her) wherein she has to make glum grimaces a good deal of the time, and it is a law of the movies that no stellar favorite must appear anything but beautiful. The sight of even a blue-eyed blond sulking and sobbing is, therefore, contrary to the pictorial edict","excerpt":"there are undoubtedly more persons who would like to see Miss La Plante in a smiling rôle than those who prefer to gaze upon her countenance when distorted by a petulant expression.In this production, Joyce is jealous of the attention Dr. John Waller gives to his women patients. She has reason to feel that Dr. Waller is somewhat obtuse in not being able to see through some of the ruses of Mrs. Paulo Warren, a lady who has made marrying a habit. However, Dr. Waller and Joyce forgive and forget, but on the eve of their marriage Mrs. Warren again intrudes, with the result that Joyce braves the discomforts of a ride in a fishmonger's car rather than suffer the indignity of marrying a man who is in such great demand by female patients.In the scenes aboard the houseboat there is a flood of happenings, including the idea of the houseboat being set adrift by Joyce, who by that time had decided that she and no other girl was going to marry Dr. Waller. To be sure, it will be no surprise to state that she succeeds.Miss La Plante in many of the scenes goes through the antics of a 14-year-old girl, which is probably due to the direction. Bryant Washburn is satisfactory as the much-sought-after physician. Paulette Duval is competent as Mrs. Warren. Tully Marshall, a talented actor, is lost in the sea of sundry mishaps and Walter Hiers is never given a chance to be funny.

Foley's introduction, as recorded by The New York Times:    FOLEY. Mr. President, it is customary at joint sessions for the chair to present the President to the members of Congress directly and without further comment. But I wish to depart from tradition tonight and express to you on behalf of the Congress and the country and through you to the members of our armed forces our warmest congratulations on the brilliant victory of the Desert Storm operation.    Members of the Congress, I now have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States.     BUSH. Mr. President and Mr. Speaker, thank you, sir, for those very generous words spoken from the heart about the wonderful performance of our military. Members of Congress: Five short weeks ago, I came to this House to speak to you about the State of the Union. And we met then in time of war. Tonight, we meet in a world blessed by the promise of peace.   From the moment Operation Desert Storm commenced on Jan. 16 until the time the guns fell silent at midnight one week ago, this nation has watched its sons and daughters with pride -- watched over them with prayer. As Commander in Chief, I can report to you: Our armed forces fought with honor and valor. And as President, I can report to the nation aggression is defeated. The war is over.   This is a victory for every country in the coalition, for the United Nations. A victory for unprecedented international cooperation and diplomacy, so well led by our Secretary of State James Baker. It is a victory for the rule of law and for what is right.   Desert Storm's success belongs to the team that so ably leads our armed forces, our Secretary of Defense and our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs: Dick Cheney and Colin Powell.   And while you're standing, this military victory also belongs to the one the British call the \\"Man of the Match,\\" the tower of calm at the eye of Desert Storm, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf.   And let us, recognizing this was a coalition effort, let us not forget Saudi General Khalid, Britain's General de la Billiere, or General Roquejoffra of France, and all the others whose leadership played such a vital role. And most importantly, most importantly of all, all those who served in the field.   I thank the members of this Congress. Support here for our troops in battle was overwhelming. And above all, I thank those whose unfailing love and support sustained our courageous men and women: I thank the American people. World After War     Tonight -- tonight, I come to this House to speak about the world, the world after war.   The recent challenge could not have been clearer. Saddam Hussein was the villain, Kuwait the victim. To the aid of this small country came nations from North America and Europe, from Asia and South America, from Africa and the Arab world, all united against aggression.   Our uncommon coalition must now work in common purpose to forge a future that should never again be held hostage to the darker side of human nature.   Tonight in Iraq, Saddam walks amidst ruin. His war machine is crushed. His ability to threaten mass destruction is itself destroyed. His people have been lied to, denied the truth. And when his defeated legions come home, all Iraqis will see and feel the havoc he has wrought. And this I promise you: For all that Saddam has done to his own people, to the Kuwaitis, and to the entire world, Saddam and those around him are accountable.   All of us grieve for the victims of war, for the people of Kuwait and the suffering that scars the soul of that proud nation. We grieve for all our fallen soldiers and their families, for all the innocents caught up in this conflict. And yes, we grieve for the people of Iraq, a people who have never been our enemy. My hope is that one day we will once again welcome them as friends into the community of nations. Four Key Challenges     Our commitment to peace in the Middle East does not end with the liberation of Kuwait. So tonight, let me outline four key challenges to be met.   First, we must work together to create shared security arrangements in the region. Our friends and allies in the Middle East recognize that they will bear the bulk of the responsibility for regional security. But we want them to know that just as we stood with them to repel aggression, so now America stands ready to work with them to secure the peace.   This does not mean stationing U.S. ground forces in the Arabian Peninsula, but it does mean American participation in joint exercises involving both air and ground forces. It means maintaining a capable U.S. naval presence in the region, just as we have for over 40 years. And let it be clear: Our vital national interests depend on a stable and secure gulf.   Second, we must act to control the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the missiles used to deliver them. It would be tragic if the nations of the Middle East and Persian Gulf were now, in the wake of war, to embark on a new arms race. Iraq requires special vigilance. Until Iraq convinces the world of its peaceful intentions -- that its leaders will not use new revenues to rearm and rebuild its menacing war machine -- Iraq must not have access to the instruments of war.   And third, we must work to create new opportunities for peace and stability in the Middle East. On the night I announced Operation Desert Storm, I expressed my hope that out of the horrors of war might come new momentum for peace. We've learned in the modern age, geography cannot guarantee security and security does not come from military power alone.   All of us know the depth of bitterness that has made the dispute between Israel and its neighbors so painful and intractable. Yet, in the conflict just concluded, Israel and many of the Arab states have for the first time found themselves confronting the same aggressor. By now, it should be plain to all parties that peacemaking in the Middle East requires compromise. At the same time, peace brings real benefits to everyone. We must do all that we can to close the gap between Israel and the Arab states and between Israelis and Palestinians. The tactics of terror lead absolutely nowhere","excerpt":"there can be no substitute for diplomacy.   A comprehensive peace must be grounded in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of territory for peace. This principle must be elaborated to provide for Israel's security and recognition, and at the same time for legitimate Palestinian political rights. Anything else would fail the twin tests of fairness and security. The time has come to put an end to Arab-Israeli conflict.   The war with Iraq is over. The quest for solutions to the problems in Lebanon, in the Arab-Israeli dispute, and in the gulf must go forward with new vigor and determination. And I guarantee you no one will work harder for a stable peace in the region than we will.   Fourth, we must foster economic development for the sake of peace and progress. The Persian Gulf and Middle East -- and Middle East -- form a region rich in natural resources with a wealth of untapped human potential. Resources once squandered on military might -- military might must be redirected to more peaceful ends. We are already addressing the immediate economic consequences of Iraq's aggression. Now, the challenge is to reach higher to foster economic freedom and prosperity for all the people of the region. By meeting these four challenges we can build a framework for peace. I've asked Secretary of State Baker to go to the Middle East to begin the process. He will go to listen, to probe, to offer suggestions, to advance the search for peace and stability.    I've also asked him to raise the plight of the hostages held in Lebanon. We have not forgotten them. And we will not forget them.   To all the challenges that confront this region of the world, there is no single solution, no solely American answer. But we can make a difference. America will work tirelessly as a catalyst for positive change.   But we cannot lead a new world abroad if, at home, it's politics as usual on American defense and diplomacy. It's time to turn away from the temptation to protect unneeded weapons systems and obsolete bases. It's time to put an end, it's time to put an end to micro-management of foreign and security assistance programs, micro-management that humiliates our friends and allies and hamstrings our diplomacy. It's time to rise above the parochial and the pork barrel, to do what is necessary, what's right and what will enable this nation to play the leadership role required of us.   The consequences of the conflict in the gulf reach far beyond the confines of the Middle East. Twice before in this century, an entire world was convulsed by war. Twice this century, out of the horrors of war hope emerged for enduring peace. Twice before, those hopes proved to be a distant dream, beyond the grasp of man.   Until now, the world we've known has been a world divided, a world of barbed wire and concrete block, conflict and cold war.   And now, we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order. In the words of Winston Churchill, a \\"world order\\" in which \\"the principles of justice and fair play . . . protect the weak against the strong.\\" A world where the United Nations, freed from cold war stalemate, is poised to fulfill the historic vision of its founders. A world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations.   The gulf war put this new world to its, its first test. And my fellow Americans, we passed that test.   For the sake of our principles, for the sake of the Kuwaiti people, we stood our ground. Because the world would not look the other way, Ambassador Al-Sabah, tonight Kuwait is free. Where is he? And we're very happy about that. Lessons of History     Tonight, as our troops begin to come home, let us recognize that the hard work of freedom still calls us forward. We've learned the hard lessons of history. The victory over Iraq was not waged as \\"a war to end all wars.\\" Even the new world order cannot guarantee an era of perpetual peace. But enduring peace must be our mission.   Our success in the gulf will shape not only the new world order we seek but our mission here at home.   In the war just ended, there were clear-cut objectives, timetables and, above all, an overriding imperative to achieve results. We must bring that same sense of self-discipline, that same sense of urgency, to the way we meet challenges here at home.   In my State of the Union Address and in my budget, I defined a comprehensive agenda to prepare for the next American century.   Our first priority is to get this economy rolling again. The fear and uncertainty caused by the gulf crisis were understandable. But now that the war is over, oil prices are down, interest rates are down and confidence is rightly coming back. Americans can move forward to lend, spend and invest in this, the strongest economy on earth.   We must also enact the legislation that is key to building a better America, For example, in 1990, we enacted an historic Clean Air Act. And now we've proposed a national energy strategy. We passed a child care bill that put power in the hands of parents. And today, we're ready to do the same thing with our schools, and expand, expand choice in education. We passed a crime bill that made a useful start in fighting crime and drugs. This year we're sending to Congress our comprehensive crime package to finish the job. We passed the landmark Americans With Disabilities Act. And now we've sent forward our civil rights bill. We also passed the aviation bill. This year we've sent up our new highway bill.   And these are just a few of our pending proposals for reform and renewal. Call for Domestic Action     So tonight, I call on the Congress to move forward aggressively on our domestic front. Let's begin with two initiatives we should be able to agree on quickly. transportation and crime. And then, let's build on success with those and enact the rest of our agenda. If our forces could win the ground war in 100 hours, then surely the Congress can pass this legislation in 100 days. Let, let that be a promise we make tonight to the American people.   When I spoke in this House about the state of our union, I asked all of you: If we can selflessly confront evil for the sake of good in a land so far away, then surely we can make this land all that it should be. In the time since then, the brave men and women of Desert Storm accomplished more than even they may realize. They set out to confront an enemy abroad, and in the process, they transformed a nation at home.   Think, think of the way they went about their mission -- with confidence and quiet pride. Think about their sense of duty, about all they taught us, about our values, about ourselves.   We hear so often about our young people in turmoil, how our children fall short, how our schools fail us, how American products and American workers are second class. Well, don't you believe it. The America we saw in Desert Storm was first-class talent.   And they -- and they did it -- they did it using America's state-of-the-art technology. We saw the excellence embodied in the Patriot missile and the patriots who made it work.   And we saw soldiers who know about honor and bravery and duty and country and the world-shaking power of these simple words.   There is something noble and majestic about the pride, about the patriotism, that we feel tonight.   So, to everyone here, and everyone watching at home, think about the men and women of Desert Storm. Let us honor them with our gratitude. Let us comfort the families of the fallen and remember each precious life lost.   Let us learn from them as well. Let us honor those who have served us by serving others.   Let us honor them as individuals, men and women of every race, all creeds and colors, by setting the face of this nation against discrimination, bigotry and hate. Eliminate that.   I'm sure that many of you saw on -- on the television -- the unforgettable scene of four terrified Iraqi soldiers surrendering. They emerged from their bunker broken, tears streaming from their eyes, fearing the worst. And then there was an American soldier. Remember what he said? He said: \\"It's O.K. You're all right now. You're all right now.\\"   That scene says a lot about America, a lot about who we are. Americans are a caring people. We are a good people, a generous people. Let us always be caring and good and generous in all we do. March Home From Gulf     Soon, very soon, our troops will begin the march we've all been waiting for, their march home. And I have directed Secretary Cheney to begin the immediate return of American combat units from the gulf.   Less than two hours from now, the first planeload of American soldiers will lift off from Saudi Arabia headed for the U.S.A. That plane will carry the men and women of the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division bound for Fort Stewart, Ga. This is just -- this is just the beginning of a steady flow of American troops coming home.   Let their return remind us that all those who have gone before are linked with us in the long line of freedom's march. Americans have always tried to serve, to sacrifice nobly for what we believe to be right.   Tonight, I ask every community in this country to make this coming Fourth of July a day of special celebration for our returning troops. They may have missed Thanksgiving and Christmas, but I can tell you this: For them and for their families, we can make this a holiday they'll never forget.   In a very real sense, this victory belongs to them, to the privates and the pilots, to the sergeants and the supply officers, to the men and women in the machines, and the men and women who made them work. It belongs to the regulars, to the Reserves, to the National Guard. This victory belongs to the finest fighting force this nation has ever known in its history.   We went halfway around the world to do what is moral and just and right. And we fought hard, and -- with others -- we won the war. And we lifted the yoke of aggression and tyranny from a small country that many Americans had never even heard of, and we ask nothing in return.   We're coming home now proud, confident, heads high. There is much that we must do at home and abroad. And we will do it. We are Americans.   May God bless this great nation, the United States of America. Thank you all very much.   Thank you guys. Thank you very, very much.

By Robert McNamara. 212 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $14.95.    FROM 1961 to 1968 Robert McNamara dominated United States security policy, serving Presidents Kennedy and Johnson as Secretary of Defense. His reputation before his arrival at the Pentagon was as a manager rather than as a strategic thinker. He depended on the quality of his bright young staff to help him formulate his policies. These ''whiz kids,'' as they were not so affectionately known, came from the universities and research institutes such as Rand, full of the new analytical skills and lines of argument that had been developing during the late 1950's in an attempt to come to grips with the demands of the nuclear age.   Mr. McNamara was not the source of many of the ideas that came to be associated with his name, but, in line with his managerial philosophy, he made them systematic and precise. In his presentation of United States policy, especially in the area of nuclear strategy, there was a sense of irresistible logic.

Crises have a habit of making a man—or a nation—bethink himself of his friends. When a man does it, his reminiscences are apt to grow maudlin, interspersed with \\"Good old Charlie's\\" and hearty sniffles. \\"Entente Cordiale\\" is considerably more self-contained. The French are practical folk and, although their film is obviously designed to pat the British on the back, they manage to get in just enough digs to spare the English the embarrassment of being eulogized.It has, at any rate, quite enough wit, good characterization and pertinent content to justify its twin-opening yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse and the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse. Although it moves as ponderously as Edward VII himself through the court balls, the state receptions and even the promenades of Marienbad, its speech is amusing and frequently impudent, it is happily free of that besetting sin of the historical film: self-consciousness, and we confess our thorough enjoyment of it for all its transparency of purpose. That the entente cordiale was not entirely a holy alliance is much less to the point here than that it has provided an amusing historical film.It is a biography, primarily, of the portly, affable and disarmingly clever Edward VII whose mother, Victoria, while she lived, had been inclined to deplore his frequent trips to Paris (where every one pretended to be fooled by his incognito), his fondness for the French, his indulgence in fat black cigars. But then there was the Fashoda incident in the Sudan which strained Franco-British relations almost to the point of war","excerpt":"there had been the realization of wily Bismarck's plan to isolate France, and there was Wilhelm II's dangerous ambition to make Germany England's equal on the seas. And once again a \\"fit of absent-mindedness\\"—for presumably there had been no forethought in the Prince of Wales' admiration for the French—had come to the aid of the British Empire.Victor Francen's Edward is the bulwark of the show and is one of the cutest—using the word in its sly sense—characterizations we have seen this year. \\"Charmante!\\" the ladies say of him after he has broken the ice on his Paris goodwill trip. Charming he is, and never more so than when he is complimenting an unfriendly Paris editor on the amusing venom he writes or luring Joseph Chamberlain into confessing he has no diplomatic hopes for his son Neville—\\" a good business man, perhaps, or a lawyer; but he'll never make a politician.\\" The historical portrait gallery about him has been well-posed by Gaby Morlay's tottering Victoria, Jean Worms' Delcasse, Jacques Baumer's Clemenceau, Janine Darcey's editor Roussel, Jean Perier's Loubet, Jean Toulout's stiff Chamberlain, among the many others.

The range of chardonnay wines available to the American consumer is little short of staggering. By informal count, there are more than 600 wineries in this country making wine from chardonnay grapes. They range from the rich, complex, almost dramatic wines produced in small quantities by Chalone Vineyard in the Gavilan Mountains in California to the fruity, uncomplicated wines made in substantial quantities by producers like Fetzer, Sutter Home and Glen Ellen.   Chardonnay is a European grape, and no one seems to know when it first turned up in this country. Chances are it arrived in the 19th century, when viticulturists brought cuttings of hundreds of different European vines to the New World to learn which would thrive best. It probably came under another name, to be identified years later.   In \\"California's Great Chardonnays\\" (Wine Spectator Press), James Laube traces the commercial production of chardonnay as a varietal wine -- chardonnay alone, unblended -- back to the Wente Brothers in the Livermore Valley, east of San Francisco. The Wentes first planted chardonnay in the 1920's, during Prohibition. Their first bottling of pinot chardonnay, as the grape was known then, came in 1936, three years after repeal. Through the 1950's, many wineries experimented with chardonnay, almost all of them using cuttings from the Wente vineyard. Even today, the so-called Wente clone is responsible for much of California's best chardonnay.   In the late 1940's and early 1950's, a handful of wine makers in the North Coast counties of Napa and Sonoma made the first truly great California chardonnays. The McCreas at Stony Hill, the Taylors at Mayacamas and James Zellerbach at Hanzell produced wines that set the standards for the hundreds of wine makers to follow.   Zellerbach, who tried to recreate Burgundy's Clos de Vougeot in the hills outside the town of Sonoma, was the first to use small French oak barrels to age his wines. Today, hundreds of American wine makers, from Long Island to Washington State, routinely use French oak not only for aging their wine but for fermenting it as well.   Despite protestations to the contrary, white Burgundy has long been the model most serious American wine makers strive to emulate. Originally, California wine makers insisted they were taking a different path. Some of their overblown, high-alcohol wines supported their claim. There was a feeling that the Burgundians looked down on the American efforts. After discovering that the Burgundians were fascinated by American wines, the Californians loss their inferiority complex and began exploring French methods. Today it's easy to mistake top California chardonnays for fine Meursaults and Puligny-Montrachets.   The Sonoma-Cutrer winery, which makes only chardonnay, has sponsored two chardonnay conferences for American and European producers. The first was held in California in 1986. The second, held in Beaune last year, even attracted a famous Italian chardonnay maker, Angelo Gaja.   Chardonnay is not widely produced in France","excerpt":"there is 10 times more ugni blanc, the French name for Italy's trebbiano. But the chardonnay grape is used in virtually all of France's best white wines, from Champagne, where it can be blended with meunier and pinot noir or used alone, south through Chablis, where it is the only approved grape, on through the Cote d'Or, where it reigns supreme, and down to the Maconnais, where it turns up in everything from Pouilly-Fuisse to that singular anomaly, Beaujolais blanc.   Those are chardonnay's traditional boundaries. But there is no holding the grape back. These days, it turns up in the Rhone, the Loire Valley and the long-forgotten Ardeche. Starting in the north of Italy, it has crept south to the point where it seems ready to jump across the straits to Sicily. Some of the barrel-aged chardonnays from the Piedmont can compete with the best of France and California. In Spain the grape is being used with considerable success in the Penedes, west of Barcelona, by Jean Leon and Miguel Torres.   Below the Equator, Australia offers a wide selection of chardonnays, a few of which are outstanding. New Zealand makes a leaner variety, more in the style of French Chablis. Back in this country, chardonnay is also produced, with varying degrees of success, in Virginia, New Jersey, Texas, New Mexico and Idaho, as well as Washington and Oregon.   Chardonnay is known as a wine maker's wine. It's not a hard grape to grow and no more difficult to harvest than most. What counts is what happens after that. And in fact, for every Chalone or Sonoma-Cutrer, there are dozens of uninspiring California chardonnays on the market at high prices. In France, for every Vincent Leflaive or Etienne Sauzet, there are dozens of wine makers turning out characterless, watery concoctions that do not deserve to be called Burgundy.   Vladimir Horowitz once said that the piano is the easiest instrument to play but the hardest instrument to play well. He might have been a pretty good chardonnay maker.
