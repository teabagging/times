Poindexter, the national security adviser, used the verb in that sense when asked about what Secretary of State George P.

''I suspect  [ Shultz told the league ]  that we were still working to staunch the flow of arms into Iran,'' said Admiral Poindexter, adding, ''Now, the reason that we're trying to staunch the flow of arms into Iran is to stop the war.''   The Administration was embarrassed at the revelation in Iran that the arms flow had not been staunched - indeed, that arms had been secretly shipped by the United States to Iran - contrary to ''Operation Staunch.'' Secretary Shultz was embarrassed at the way a secret White House operation, which he opposed, had made him look like a hypocrite. Most important of all, grammarians were embarrassed at the confusion between the verb staunch, spelled stanch in The Times and many other publications, and the adjective staunch, which means ''loyal, steadfast, trustworthy.''

In front of me, random 9-year-olds between Saturday soccer engagements, young mothers with babies and a few stray sister alumnae from Mount Holyoke College are assembling. \\"Meet Wendy Wasserstein, author of 'Pamela's First Musical,' in aisle 1,\\" announces the store loudspeaker. Suddenly I wonder if we might draw a larger crowd if they also offered half-price Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles. When it's obvious that we will not be  diverting any more audience from the Silly Putty or Creepy Crawlers section, I begin reading out loud from my new book for children. For a moment I have renewed sympathy for anyone who has ever demonstrated slicing and dicing cole slaw in the middle of a Grand Union. From now on, I will always pay complete attention. By the end of my story of a girl's first trip to a Broadway musical,  one baby is crying, two pre-teen-agers are giggling and the four kids in the front row seem either in rapt attention or completely bored.          When I ask if there are any questions, a boy in the back I had not noticed earlier raises his hand. \\"How do you pick the choreographer?\\" He looks at me earnestly. I'm not certain if I'm in the presence of Michael Bennett, Bob Fosse, Jerome Robbins or an adolescent combination of all three. But it's one compelling reason to continue trekking across the country. On this particular recent spring book tour, I'm informed by my \\"media escorts\\" -- those patient professionals who take an out-of-town author to every local newspaper interview  and personal appearance -- that I am following the O. J. attorney, Robert Shapiro, and on my heels is the television series star Brett Butler. Though I'm  sure that each endures an exhausting schedule, I'm certain neither Bob nor Brett has plans to be interviewed on South Bloomington, Minn., cable by a 9-year-old, or to read aloud beside a live rooster. When I look back on my first foray into children's literature, it seems an act of complete naivete and hubris at once. My friend Andrew Jackness, the illustrator of \\"Pamela's First Musical,\\" is a theatrical set designer and I am a playwright. We're both New Yorkers who hoped our book would inspire children to fall in love with musicals in the same  way we had. Neither of us imagined that the world we were entering, albeit on a  sojourn, had quite so much in common -- in all its ambition, difficulty and quirkiness -- with our own.

He had just celebrated his 92nd birthday. He was born on the plains in Lakin, Kansas and lived there through the Dust Bowl and the Depression. After graduating from Kansas State University in 1934 with high honors, he began graduate studies at Harvard which led to a Master's Degree in Agricultural Economics before WWII intervened. He served in Washington in the Office of Price Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers during the War, eventually joining the Reserves as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1946. His business career began with Harry Ferguson Inc., the farm equipment manufacturer, in Detroit in 1946. After the company merged with Massey Harris in 1953, he advanced to the President of the combined entity in 1956. He became Chief Executive Officer in 1966 and served in that role until his retirement in 1978. He presided over Massey's global expansion in the 60's and 70's. During much of this period he and his family resided in Toronto, Canada. However, he considered Boca Raton his home for the last 40 years. During his career and his retirement he served as a director and trustee of numerous boards including the University of Guelph, Lynn University, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Farm Equipment Institute and the Royal Palm Yacht and Country Club. Mr. Thornbrough, devoted husband for 61 years to Virginia Thornbrough, is survived by his three children: Susan Thornbrough Staiger and Jon Staiger","excerpt":"Wayne Thornbrough and his wife Barbara; Grant Thornbrough and his wife Diana.

''In her apartment in New York City, she had a white marble mantle. On it was an English china hunting set - figurines of dogs, horses, the whole scene. And on the white marble table, a ruby red oil lamp.'' Mrs. Olsen paused, looked at a painting of a woman arranging fancy china in a wooden cabinet. ''See that, right there. That would have been her place.''\\n\\nMrs. Olsen was at the Hudson River Museum, looking at an exhibition entitled ''Domestic Bliss: Family Life in American Painting, 1840 through 1910.'' On view through mid-July ''Domestic Bliss'' is the sort of collection you would, in fact, want your grandmother to see. It is also a show for father, mother, sister, brother and children - anyone who is flesh and blood, or part of the circle at home. For what ''Domestic Bliss'' does, through its 90 lovely paintings, is evoke the idealized, idyllic Victorian view of the family, the view that home is a haven where everyone, from infant to aged, is safe.\\n\\nThe show of genre paintings -scenes from everyday living - should trigger memories. Alison Paul, the museum's director of education, said: ''The show, I think, really chronicles life cycles. The paintings are very detailed in terms of room interiors portrayed.

That interpretation was short-lived. In Washington, Martin S.  Feldstein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, quickly responded: ''I don't believe there is any basis for believing that there has been any change in current Administration policy.'' And Marc E. Leland, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, under orders from a reportedly outraged boss, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, said Mr. Sprinkel was ''speaking for himself.''   That spat remains to be resolved.

Playing like a lottery team instead of a playoff team, the Knicks were bludgeoned and humiliated by the Chicago Bulls, 126-85, in the opening game of their three-of-five-game playoff series. The KNicks' margin of defeat was their largest in their playoff history, surpassing a 130-90 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers in 1978. - Few people believed the Knicks would win this playoff series before it began. Maybe the Knicks don't believe they can win, either.   \\"I'm embarrassed","excerpt":"we all should be,\\" said guard Gerald Wilkins. \\"I'm sure we all think we can still win. But this was sad. We just flat out got buried.\\"   On a night when almost every Knick underachieved, All-Star center Patrick Ewing's performance was the most baffling. He finished with 6 points, the lowest of his career in playoffs, and was held scoreless in the second half.   Ewing sat out the fourth quarter, and he took only seven shots in the game and one shot in the third quarter. The Knicks were too unorganized to get him the ball consistently in the low post, frustrated by Chicago's double-teaming defense against Ewing.   When asked what Chicago did to deny him the ball, an angry Ewing said: \\"I don't know what happened. Ask Coach. I get double-teamed every night. That's a way of life now, like waking up in the morning. I was frustrated. I wasn't getting the ball.\\"   Ewing looked like a mentally defeated player during parts of the game. He lost his composure late in the third quarter after committing his fifth foul. He argued the call and received a technical foul, then left the game a short time later and never returned.   Michael Jordan led Chicago with 28 points, sitting out the entire fourth quarter. Scottie Pippen added 25 points and 10 rebounds. Kiki Vandeweghe led New York with 19 points. The Knicks never got within 24 points in the second half.   \\"We have to make a conscious effort to get Patrick the ball,\\" said Knicks forward Charles Oakley. \\"We lost our game plan. If we don't get Patrick the ball, we're not going anywhere.\\"   Knicks Coach John MacLeod described New York's inability to get Ewing the ball this way:   \\"We practiced specific plays for Patrick and called them throughout the game, but the Bulls shut down the post and did not let us execute.\\"   Nothing by the Knicks worked. New York's most embarrassing first half this season ended with Chicago leading, 65-36. For much of the game, the Knicks looked like children being manhandled by neighborhood bullies. The Bulls were more physical and more intense. They chased down almost every loose ball. Their defense took away all semblance of order from New York's offense. While the Bulls looked mentally ready for a playoff game, the Knicks looked ready for an early summer vacation.   There were ominous signs for the Knicks from the opening tap. Ewing was once again outplayed, outmuscled and outsmarted by Bill Cartwright. Ewing's first-half line read like this: 6 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist and 4 turnovers. Those are not All-Star numbers. Those are AWOL numbers.   Ewing committed his second foul less than nine minutes into the game, pushing off trying to grab an offensive rebound. Knowing how much the Knicks needed him, it was a senseless foul that early in the evening. Six years into this career, Ewing is still committing careless fouls in important games.   His third foul came with 5 minutes 15 seconds left in the second quarter, when he pushed Will Perdue fighting for position. Perdue did a Hollywood-like acting job, forcing the referee to make a call. Ewing waved his hand in disgust, but the bottom line was that he had three fouls and MacLeod had to substitute for him. Ewing spent the last five minutes of the half sitting on the bench, exactly where Chicago wanted him.   \\"We knew we had to come out and send a message and take care of business,\\" Jordan said. \\"New York will be here a couple of days until Sunday, and I think they will think about this game mentally.\\"   The Bulls didn't need Jordan's magic tonight. Pippen, who has frolicked against the Knicks all season, did it again. He scored 19 points in the first half, taking Vandeweghe and Brian Quinnett off the dribble almost at will.

Box 65793, Washington, D.C. 20035, $25)? Consider this stand-alone triumph: \\"He lay facedown under the tree and bit off some grass near the roots, chewing to distract his smile, but it would not give in, and so he lay there the entire day, smiling into the earth.\\" Or: \\"She heard his breath take over for him and, in that secretive way the sleeper knows nothing about, carry on his life.\\" Ms. Berriault is nothing if not consistent. In these  35 stories, one struggles to find a sentence that is anything less than jewel-box perfect.

These are complex characters, and although many stories  run only a few pages Ms. Berriault never falls back on cliches: an aging male librarian, for example, is no shrinking violet; instead, he sports \\"a Borsalino  fedora\\" and \\"English boots John Major would covet.\\" Most of Ms. Berriault's characters are caught at moments of divergence: in \\"Soul and Money,\\" a lapsed Communist confronts God and Mammon in Las Vegas; in \\"Lives of the Saints,\\" the son of a famous religious artist undertakes his own sort of pilgrimage, visiting his father's works, and discovers that life is more lasting than art. Yet in the smooth flow of Ms. Berriault's writing, few of these people manage to register the emotional pitch needed to transcend their crises. It is not a matter of stoicism; instead, most seem dizzyingly unaware of the option to act on their own behalf. Thus the stories, so exquisite to wend through, leave one a little cold.

WE live, Julian Barnes suggests in an earlier book, in \\"a pragmatic and knowing century\\"","excerpt":"we are also, he says in another, \\"modern and ignorant.\\" Can we really be all these things? Of course. Knowingness is not knowledge, and pragmatism and modernity are two of our favorite boasts about ourselves. But who is making this diagnosis? In the first case it is Geoffrey Braithwaite, the grieving, widowed doctor and ardent Flaubert fan who tells the story of \\"Flaubert's Parrot\\"; in the second, it is the deviser of the brilliant exploration of Gricault's \\"Raft of the Medusa\\" in \\"A History of the World in 10  Chapters.\\" These characters are not exempt from the condition they describe, they are symptoms of it: wry, witty, belated, supposedly practical, often helpless. Behind them hovers the shadowy figure of Julian Barnes himself, who is just as wry, witty and belated, maybe as practical, and presumably quite a bit less helpless. I'm not so sure, though. Style and intelligence, which Mr. Barnes has in abundance, can focus helplessness and allow us to think about something else, but they can scarcely make it go away. Would we want it to go away, in all cases? \\"How do we seize the past? How do we seize the foreign past? We read, we  learn, we ask, we remember, we are humble; and then a casual detail shifts everything.\\" This is Braithwaite, and \\"the foreign past,\\" for him, as for Barnes and for us, is delicately weighted with a double meaning: the past of a foreign  scene or a foreign writer, and the past of our own life or marriage or love, which, as L. P. Hartley famously said, is a foreign country. Braithwaite's answer is more than modest, but his initial metaphor is surely too greedy, full  of the promise of failure. We don't seize the past. At best we get a picture of  it, and a couple of chances to revise the picture. And the past, in Mr. Barnes's fiction, becomes a figure for a whole series of separations and gaps, places where the mind or the memory can't quite reach the other side, as if the ferry were becalmed, or the tunnel not complete: between then and now, of course, but  also between there and here, between them and us, between her and him, between any event and the chance of our understanding it.

But after that the cinema industry marked time while the Foreign Office tried to keep oil on troubled diplomatic waters. In 1936, international events indicated that the Fascist war machine would not stay leashed much longer, and word was passed on that the cinema could gun for fascism, and that the sky was pretty nearly the limit. Macheret's \\"Soviet Fatherland\\" and Wangenheim's \\"The Fighters\\" are the early results of this new policy. But exhibit \\"A\\" in this chapter is the film \\"Karl Brunner,\\" the work of the Hungarian exile, Bela Balash.In Budapest in 1919, at the time Bela Kun led the workers of Hungary to hoist the red flag, Balash was a well-known literary figure and an active Communist. In less than five months after Hungary was declared a Soviet Republic White intervention brought the new régime to a close and Balash like many others whose lives were in danger had to flee. He went to Vienna and there startled the Austrians by being one of the first Europeans to write seriously of the cinema.From Vienna Balash went to Berlin, where he worked in the theatre and wrote scenarios for Korda and Pabst. Simultaneously he was the organizer of the first Workers Film Alliance in Germany. Whether in Berlin or Vienna, Balash was still an emigré, and as long as he could not return to Hungary he believed that, being a Communist, he would fare better in the Soviet Union. Balash came to Moscow and was immediately appointed Professor of Esthetics in the Cinema Academy. \\"Karl Brunner\\" is his first picture made in the Soviet Union.Karl is the 10-year-old hero, a German boy, who comes home from school one afternoon to find that the flat in which he lives has been ransacked by the Nazi police and that his mother who works in the illegal Communist movement has disappeared. Throughout the film there is no mention of Karl's father","excerpt":"we are led to believe that he was one of the early Nazi victims and that the wife is carrying on from where her husband was forced to stop. Karl's mother has been warned of the raid in time to make her escape, but the boy has no means of knowing this. Karl is not arrested upon his arrival at the flat, but is shadowed by the Gestapo, who believe that through the son they may find the mother and uncover new sources of underground Communist activity. The working-class neighbors and their children are closely attached to the Brunners, but knowing that the boy is being watched they dare not in the beginning approach the child to inform him that his mother is safe.How Karl is finally reunited with his mother under the very nose of the Gestapo without incriminating any one makes one of the most thrilling films about children that Russia has ever produced. Obliquely the boy's adventures indicate that the Communist movement in Hitler Germany is alive and kicking; this apparently is the chief purpose of the film. \\"Karl Brunner\\" is likely to be the envy of all of Soviet regisseurs because while its technical structure is Hollywood, ideologically it is Soviet. Balash's feat is all the more laudable inasmuch as the regisseur's imperfect knowledge of Russian forced him to work through an interpreter.While this picture is running into its third week in Moscow, Balash is working on two new films; one is \\"The Internationalists,\\" which deals with the participation of foreigners in the Russian civil war, fighting on the side of the Bolsheviki; the second is a life of Mozart, whose history he describes as \\"blood-stained rococo.\\" Balash intends that the musical frame of his \\"Mozart\\" shall also reveal the dynamite that is to be found in the real story of the great musical genius of the eighteenth century who was neglected by the nobility—the art patrons of his day—and \\"was buried in a pauper's grave, with only a stray dog following the wagon in which he was being carted away.\\"The well-known German composer, Sebastian, the director of the Charlottenburg Opera in Berlin until he was discovered to be a non-Aryan (hence, now living in Moscow), has been appointed musical director of the forthcoming \\"Mozart.\\" BELA BALASH CARRIES ON"},{"year":"2017","title":"The Women’s March was an uprising.

Her voice is a clear, versatile instrument, full of light and shadows and totally at home with the verse. Her lithe, athletic body is balletic in its grace, whether Hamlet is darting antically about Polonius or lurching dangerously at Laertes in the final duel. And, yes, Miss Venora also has that intangible quality of magnetism: Even when she's not center stage, you find that your eyes are irresistibly drawn to her.   The other gift that Miss Venora brings to ''Hamlet'' is her ability to play a man - or at least a man-boy.

Schindler (Doubleday, $12.95), is a spectacular-looking production -oversized, with brilliantly colored illustrations that echo Dutch paintings and spill out to the edges of nearly every page, and more tulips per square inch than you'll find in a Burpee catalogue. A fictionalized account of how the first tulips came to Holland, the story falls into the hazy category of part history but largely invention. Phyllis Krasilovsky tells of a Dutchman named Hendrik who visited Persia and brought back a few tulip bulbs as a gift to his daughter, who set them in a bowl in her window, and of how the blooming flowers sent their entire city into an uproar. It's apleasing, nicely told story, satisfying to a 4- or 5-year-old.

In the last decade alone, poaching for ivory in Africa has reduced the elephant population from 1.3 million to about 600,000 -- a kill rate that would eliminate the elephant from most of that continent in the next 20 years. And for what? The manufacture of ornamental carvings and Asian signature stamps. In THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT: Last Days of Eden (Voyageur, $27.95), Boyd Norton, who has spent more than 20 years photographing wild animals, gives us a magnificent pictorial essay. He shows elephants in their African habitat, playing in a dust bath and affectionately entwining trunks and tusks. His shots depict a wrinkled old matriarch leading a family gathering to a water hole, a calf nestling at its mother's side or trying to stand on wobbly legs, and a bull with ears flapping as he charges. With these and other images not so pretty (bloodied carcasses, pyramids of tusks waiting to be sold), the book makes a strong case for the preservation of these magnificent animals, as well as other species that share their environs.

It opens, instead, with a huge photograph of a temporary mock-up of the Kroller-Muller house, a design made in 1912 for a large villa near The Hague that was never, in fact, built in final form.   It is an arresting image, and a brilliant starting point. For this house, a remarkable building of asymmetrically arranged wings of stripped classicism, at once shows us Mies's strong ties to the Germanic classical tradition and points to the future. It points backward and forward, and makes it absolutely clear at the outset that Mies's extraordinary buildings of glass - the mid-20th-century skyscrapers and houses for which he is best known, and which can truly be said to have changed the world - did not come entirely from nowhere.   In the Kroller-Muller House, a building of almost haunting beauty, we can see a simple, direct and self-assured classicism that looks back to the great 19th-century German classical architect Schinkel. But at the same time, in the balancing of light, horizontal masses, this house looks ahead","excerpt":"we can see in it glimmers of Mies's legendary Barcelona Pavilion of 1929, or his Tugendhat House of 1930.

Mitchell Democrat of Maine   Today the Senate undertakes a solemn constitutional responsibility to decide whether to commit the nation to war. In this debate, we should focus on the fundamental question before us: what is the wisest course of action for our nation in the Persian Gulf crisis.    In its simplest form, the question is whether Congress will give the President an unlimited blank check to initiate war against Iraq at some unspecified time in the future under circumstances which are not now known and cannot be foreseen.                . . .            This is not a debate about whether force should ever be used. No one proposes to rule out the use of force","excerpt":"we cannot and should not rule it out. The question is should war be truly a last resort when all other means fail or should we start with war, before other means have been fully and fairly exhausted.   This is not a debate about American objectives in the current crisis. There is broad agreement in the Senate that Iraq must fully and unconditionally withdraw its forces from Kuwait. The issue is how best to achieve that goal. Most Americans and most members of Congress, myself included, supported the President's initial decision to deploy American forces to Saudi Arabia to deter further Iraqi aggression. We supported the President's effort in marshaling international diplomatic pressure and the most comprehensive embargo in history against Iraq.    I support that policy. I believe it remains the correct policy, even though the President abandoned his own policy before it had time to work. The change began on Nov. 8, when President Bush announced that he was doubling the number of American troops in the Persian Gulf to 430,000 in order to attain a credible offensive option. The President did not consult with Congress about that decision; he did not try to build support for it among the American people. He just did it.   In so doing, President Bush transformed the United States' role and its risks in the Persian Gulf crisis. In effect, the President, overnight, with no consultation and no public debate, changed American policy from being part of a collective effort to enforce economic and diplomatic sanctions into a predominantly American effort, relying upon the use of American military force.   Despite the fact that his own policy of international economic sanctions was having a significant effect upon the Iraqi economy, the President, without explanation, abandoned that approach and instead adopted a policy based first and foremost upon the use of American military force. As a result, this country has been placed on a course toward war. This has upset the balance of the President's initial policy, the balance between resources and responsibility, between interest and risk, between patience and strength.                . . .            It may become necessary to use force to expel Iraq from Kuwait, but because war is such a grave undertaking, with such serious consequences, we must make certain that war is employed only as a last resort. Representative Robert H. Michel Republican of Illinois   I speak from the prejudice of being a combat veteran of World War II. And those of our generation know from bloody experience that unchecked aggression against a small nation is a prelude to an international disaster.    Saddam Hussein today has more planes and tanks and, frankly, men under arms, than Hitler had at the time when Prime Minister Chamberlain came back from Munich with that miserable piece of paper -- peace in our time. I'll never forget that replay of that movie in my life.    And I have an obligation, I guess, coming from that generation, to transmit those thoughts I had at the time to the younger generation who didn't experience what we did. Saddam Hussein not only invaded Kuwait, he occupied, terrorized, murdered civilians, systematically looted and turned a peaceful nation into a wasteland of horror. He seeks control over one of the world's vital resources, and he ultimately seeks to make himself the unchallenged anti-Western dictator of the Mideast.    Either we stop him now, and stop him permanently, or we won't stop him at all.    Now the President has clearly presented the reasons why we can't stand by idly. In his words, and I quote them -- we're in the gulf because the world must not and cannot reward aggression, and we're there because our vital interests are at stake. Now we're told by some that we must show patience. We must wait for sanctions to work.    We must wait six months or a year before forces are used. We must stay the course. My question is this -- stay what course? A course that allows Saddam to know he is freed from surprise attack, free from sudden offensive movement for six months or a year or more? And I guess to you who advocate that course, I would have to ask you to do -- what you would do about the attitude of the American people in that interval period of time? How long is the American people -- will the American people put up with that? Senator Strom Thurmond   Republican of South Carolina     Mr. President, how much longer can we expect them to maintain their combat readiness? How much longer can we expect our soldiers' families to carry on under the tremendous burdens they are carrying? They are not only dealing with the uncertainty of not knowing how much longer their loved ones will be gone from home but also with anguish that war could break out at any moment.    Mr. President, the Congress must act and let its voice be heard. The time to end the debate is now. I implore this body to demonstrate to the world and especially Saddam Hussein that we are behind our President and the United Nations. A vote in support of the President is a vote for peace. I urge my colleagues to stop the debate and show our solidarity with the President and resolve to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. Solidarity, we need it now, not division, but solidarity. Senator Edward M. Kennedy   Democrat of Massachusetts     I urge the Senate to vote for peace, not war. Now is not the time for war. I reject the argument that says Congress must support the President, right or wrong. We have our own responsibility to do what is right, and I believe that war today is wrong.   War is not the only option left to us in the Persian Gulf. The President may have set Jan. 15 as    his    deadline, but the American people have not. Sanctions and diplomacy may still achieve our objectives, and Congress has the responsibility to insure that all peaceful options are exhausted before resort to war. Unless we reach that stage, Congress ought not to authorize the President to use force.   At this historic moment, it may well be that only Congress can stop this senseless march toward war.                . . .            Let there be no mistake about the cost of war. We have arrayed an impressive international coalition against Iraq, but when the bullets start flying, 90 percent of the casualties will be Americans. It is hardly a surprise that so many other nations are willing to fight to the last American to achieve the goals of the United Nations. It is not their sons and daughters who will do the dying. Most military experts tell us that a war with Iraq would not be quick and decisive, as President Bush suggests; it'll be brutal, and costly. It'll take weeks, even months, and will quickly turn from an air war to a ground war, with thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands, of American casualties.   The Administration refuses to release casualty estimates, but the 45,000 body bags the Pentagon has sent to the region are all the evidence we need of the high price in lives and blood that we will have to spare. Military experts have used Israel's two recent desert wars as reliable indicators of the casualties we will suffer. In the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel suffered 3,300 casualties out of a force of 300,000, including 7,000 dead. In the heavier fighting that lasted 20 days in the 1973 war, Israeli casualties were 11,000 out of a force of a similar size, with 2,600 dead.    In other words, we're talking about the likelihood of at least 3,000 American casualties a week, with 700 dead, for as long as the war goes on. Senator John C. Danforth   Republican of Missouri     The one and only chance to accomplish our objectives without war is to maintain sanctions accompanied by a credible military threat. Without a credible military threat, our alternative is sanctions followed by nothing at all. The key to peace is maintaining a credible military threat, and this is precisely the point our pending votes will address.    Those who would give sanctions a chance before military action is even possible would decouple the two components which must be kept linked if we have any chance of getting Iraq out of Kuwait without a fight. They would foreclose any possibility of a just peace.    This is why I cannot vote for sanctions alone. This is why I cannot vote to deprive the President of the credible threat of force. It is indeed a supreme irony that it is only through the threat of force that a stable world can be maintained. But that is an irony that we have recognized ever since World War II. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan   Democrat of New York     Suddenly, on behalf of Kuwait, in opposition to Iraq, we see the largest array of armed force since the -- mankind has seen since the Second World War. And we see a President declaring -- assserting that he has the right to send those armed forces into battle independently of any judgment of the Senate. . . .   Now how could this happen? The first post-cold-war crisis, as we have had it described. I'd like to suggest, Mr. President, and I hope this might help us think about the subject -- I'd like to suggest that despite the assertions that this was the first post-cold-war crisis, and the way in which we've proceeded in that mold and which manner obtained the universal support of the country, and the Senate here -- or as near to it as makes no matter -- suddenly there is an institutional lurch back in to the manner and mode of the cold war.                . . .            Then the assertions we have heard in the past months, after the lurching from a defensive, deterrent position -- which we responded to very well -- into an offensive position, on Nov. 8; a measure taken in secret and that certainly suddenly turned what had been a collective security operation, with the complete support of the country and the world, into a crisis situation. And all through those things, the President as Commander in Chief, secretly moving to create the ongoing permanent Orwellian crisis.               . . .            What we find here is a kind of time warp in which we don't -- we're acting in an old mode with response to a new condition. I find it, for example, extraordinary that the President should so personalize the encounter with this particular thug in Baghdad -- the most recent thug in Baghdad, not the last by any means; there'll be others, they'll succeed each other. We are not in an international crisis in the sense that events that took place on Aug. 2 necessitate the confrontation of the largest set of armed forces since World War II. Nothing large happened. A nasty little country invaded a littler, but just as nasty, country.                . . .            Mr. President, our armies have been on the Rhine for 45 years, and that is to stop a Roman legion. I mean, we're still at Panmunjom. We have had naval force with some land facilities -- a base facilities -- in the gulf since the Second World War.    Well, 12 months have passed, 18 months have passed, life will go on and we will not have the wrenching Constitutional crisis that will come about with the President committing a massive use of our armed forces in a distant region of the world without the specific declaration of war by Congress. Senator Orrin G. Hatch   Republican of Utah      Mr. President, I have been watching this debate with a great deal of interest today and frankly I'm very concerned about some of the comments that have been made. I think President Bush has gone the extra mile in trying to avoid the use of force. I don't think there's any question about that. And I think it's time for Congress to help rather than hinder the President.    I think it's time for the Congress to join with the President and get behind him and our young men and women over there sitting in the sand and show that we're willing to back the use of force. I never thought I'd see the day when a timid organization like the United Nations would come out and agree and authorize the use of force by Jan. 15 and all members of Congress are unwilling to back their resolution, some of them.   Unless Saddam Hussein believes that the threat of war is real, he will not budge. I think we've learned that. The only way to avoid war, in my opinion in this particular situation, is to be prepared to go to war and to show that our resolve is for real. If Hussein won't even accept a letter from President Bush, he certainly is not going to accept Congressional clues that Iraq pull out from Kuwait. Our actions should be decisive.    If we back the President overwhelmingly we will maximize the pressure on Iraq, we will enhance the chances that we can avoid war. If the vote is close, Saddam Hussein can conclude that he can divide our country if he will only hold out. If we fail to back the President, war will become inevitable.  Senator Bill Bradley   Democrat of New Jersey      President Bush and Secretary Baker apparently have not addressed these four most probable outcomes from using massive military force. They have not apparently thought through how to deal with the potential power vacuum in Iraq, or how to cushion the negative Arab reaction to the use of massive force or how to resist pressure from our Arab coalition partners to sell out Israel, or how to prevent an isolationist reaction to a bloody war whose purpose has been inadequately explained.    Because they have not prepared for tomorrow's reaction, they should not commence offensive action today.  Senator Claiborne Pell   Democrat of Rhode Island      As amongst those who've served their country in war, and one who has pressed in the United States Senate for the toughest possible nonmilitary response to years of Iraqi lawbreaking, I believe that at this time, peace and the continuation of comprehensive sanctions is the wisest course, strongest course, best course for our nation.  Senator Arlen Specter   Republican of Pennsylvania      I personally remain hopeful, Mr. President, that war will be avoided. But it seems to me that the best way to avoid a war is to put Iraq squarely on notice with a very strong support by the Congress of the U.N. resolution and the President that we mean business and we're prepared to fight.    We wonder about the state of mind of Saddam Hussein. We wonder if he's a madman, Mr. President, and I submit that he is not. Senator Shelby and I had an opportunity to visit for an hour and 20 minutes with President Saddam Hussein just about a year ago today and I found him very poorly informed about the U.S. policy, very poorly informed about Western attitudes, did not have an understanding of our attitude about the problems of the Mideast. But he was certainly far from a mad man.    And there was later another Senate delegation with Senator Dole and Senator Metzenbaum and Senator McClure, Senator Murkowski, Senator Simpson and those senators also had a discussion with President Saddam Hussein and concluded that he was not a mad man. And we wonder what is his calculation.    It seems to me that if the current course is followed and force is used, that President Saddam Hussein will lose his country but he must have some other calculation. He may have a calculation of involving Israel in a war. He may have a calculation of trying to bring the coalition into disintegration so the Arabs will fight the Israelis. Or what he really may have in mind, and it's obviously speculative to try to figure out what is President Saddam Hussein's state of mind, he may have in mind the state of mind of the United States Congress. And that is a more perplexing state of mind than the mind of Saddam Hussein.    The comments have been made, I think it was the distinguished majority leader who raised that question about what was the will of Congress, doubt about the will of the Senate, always doubt about what we are undertaking, but if we unequivocally put Iraq and its President on notice of our intentions by a solid vote, it is my judgment that we will have an excellent chance to avoid that war.  Representative Richard A. Gephardt   Democrat of Missouri      I want to say tonight that if Saddam Hussein listens to this debate -- and we're told that he does pick up some American television -- I hope that he will take no comfort from this debate. We are united in our purpose in this country and in this Congress. Some have expressed concern that when there is a division of opinion even on strategy, that that lends help to the other side. I hope that we'd never mistake disagreement on means as disunity within our country. I can't remember a time when our country has been as unified around a set of goals, as focused on what we're trying to do, in as much agreement and unity as I think we are tonight.  Representative Patricia Schroeder   Democrat of Colorado      I rise in support of the gentleman from Indiana and Congressman Gephardt's resolution. I think it fits exactly what we know about leadership. What we have learned over and over and over again about leadership is first you commit the nation and then you commit the troops. Tonight we're talking about are we going to go even further and commit the troops way beyond where the nation is committed. I think the Hamilton-Gephardt resolution fits exactly where we are in our commitments.   No. 1, it protects U.S. forces. It allows use of force if our U.S. forces overseas are attacked. That's very important.   No. 2, it keeps our commitment to defend Saudi Arabia and use force if Saudi Arabia is attacked. The American people support that, and that makes sense.   Then it also allows for use of force if the sanctions are violated in any manner, and that's our commitment, and that makes sense. What it does not do is say that we're going to put everything out there and go for it on the 15th. I do not know why we cut off our options and decided that on Jan. 15 we had to give the President what is the equivalent of a declaration of war.  Senator William V. Roth Jr.   Republican of Delaware      The fact remains, such a united coalition is truly historic. A coalition that reflects the worldwide concern about Saddam Hussein, his belligerent character and frightening objectives. This alignment is the result of several important factors, factors that we must consider as we debate the resolutions before us.    Perhaps the first and foremost factor concerns Iraq's growth in both quantity and quality of military power. It continues at a threatening pace, despite the fact that Hussein's war with Iran is long ended.   Let no one be caught sleeping. To close an eye now would allow him the deadly latitude to consolidate his power and amass a nuclear arsenal. He is willing to bend any law and make almost any sacrifice toward these ends. He is an unpredictable as a desert storm and as deceptive as a mirage.    One can only imagine what devastating consequence would fall should his dominance be allowed in the oil-rich Middle East. And this is the second reason why he must be stopped. When I speak of the danger that would result from his control of this region, I'm not talking about consequences to major oil companies -- quite simply, I'm talking about jobs. I'm talking about the raw material of human endeavor.    Oil runs the economy of the world. It fuels our factories, heats our homes. Carries our products from manufacture to market. It's as basic to the economy as water is to life. And the free trade and international supplies is critical, not only for the industrial democracies, but the fragile third world nations that depend on this precious resource even more than we do.    Any attempt to disrupt these supplies will send a devastating quake to these economies, lengthening unemployment lines, boosting inflation in the industrial democracies and crushing the economies of developing countries where day to day existence depends on imported energy sources.  Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.   Democrat of Delaware      If there's a war, 95 percent of the casualties on the world's side will be American. If there's a war, we will prevail, we will win the battle, but 95 percent of the enmity of the Arab world outside of Iraq, to the extent there is any, will be directed at the United States.                . . .            In light of this, Mr. President, it seems almost impossible to believe that we're having a serious argument in this country today about whether under the Constitution the President alone can take a nation to war. The Constitution's language says that the war powers rest with the Congress. And from James Madison to John Marshall, the Constitution's fathers all understood this to be a key principle of the republic.    And lest anyone in this body or anyone listening wonder why I'm raising this question since there's already a resolution before us, I'm raising it because the President continues to insist he does not need, does not need the will of the people spoken through the Congress as envisioned by the Constitution to decide whether or not to go to war.    On Tuesday President Bush asked this Congress to debate and decide whether to take the nation to war yet unfortunately the President stopped short of abandoning his previous claim that he has the power acting alone to start a war.    And just yesterday, as I mentioned earlier, the President himself said that he alone has the constitutional authority to initiate war. No President before him has ever said anything like that. No President in our history has ever made such an assertion. To put it simply these views are at odds with the Constitution. They may accurately describe the power of leaders of other countris, but they do not describe the power of the President of the United States.                . . .            If the President, at least in his statements, appears willing to violate our Constitution to achieve those objectives, if this crisis is really about upholding the law of nations, I suggest the President acknowledge that he start here by upholding the law at home and clearly acknowledge that only the Congress can take this nation to war.  Senator Paul D. Wellstone   Democrat of Minnesota      I rise to speak in this chamber for the first time with a very heavy heart. I wanted my first speech to be about children and education and health care and a credible energy policy and the environment. I never thought that the first time I would have an opportunity to speak in this chamber the topic would be such a grave topic -- life and death, whether or not to go to war, to ask America's men and women, so many of them so young to risk life and limb, to unleash a tremendous destructive power on a foreign country and a far away people. This is the most momentous decision that any political leader would ever have to make and decide we must.    And let no one doubt that the Congress has the responsibility to make this decision. The Constitution is unambiguous on this point: Congress declares the war, not the President.               . . .            The policies that I am afraid the Administration is pursuing, the rush to war that I am afraid is so much of what is now happening in our country and the world, will not create a new order, Mr. President, it will create a new world disorder. What kind of victory will it be? What kind of victory will it be if we unleash forces of fanaticism in the Middle East and a chronically unstable region becomes even more unstable further jeopardizing Israel's security?                . . .            Some causes are worth fighting for, some causes are worth fighting for. This cause is not worth fighting for right now. We must stay the course with economic sanctions, continue the pressure, continue the squeeze, move forward on the diplomatic front and Mr. President, we must not, we must not rush to war.  Senator Paul Simon   Democrat of Illinois      Mr. President, there is a grim mood here in Congress as I do not recall. When you and I were elected to the House, Mr. President, in 1974, we were already involved in the Vietnam War but it was being pulled down and I have not experienced this kind of a mood before in Washington D.C. We face unprovoked aggression. No question about it. And there is no question in the minds of anyone here that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi troops have to get out of Kuwait, one way or another.    When you grow up in rural America and live in rural America you learn something very simple: don't corner a rattlesnake. Give the rattlesnake a way to get out. And that's what we have to do in the situation over there. But I have to say the diplomatic option looks very, very difficult.   The second option is the economic option, sanctions. This was imposed by the President, and the President and the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense appear to have all but given up on this. And I suggest the evidence is pretty overwhelming that this has a chance to succeed if we stick with it. No one can guarantee it but I think it has a chance.

There was an opportunity for change as drastic as going from analog to digital.    One of the major impetuses behind the move was to come back home, because my home was in Boston. I was commuting back and forth to New Jersey and for seven years I only saw my wife on weekends. I said it was time to start bringing my home life and business life together geographically.    I kept thinking about large, consumer-oriented businesses in Boston. I called in off the street to talk to Reebok's chairman and chief executive, Paul Fireman. Reebok, among others, had offered me a job 11 years before as head of sales and marketing. Paul wasn't in, but his secretary said, ''O.K. I'll take your resume.''    What I found out later was that the secretary called her girlfriend who worked at the local Sony sales office and asked if she had heard of me. She said yes, he's a good guy, and the secretary said O.K., I'll forward his resume to Human Resources. If it hadn't been for that one salesperson in the local office, I would have wound up in the wastebasket.    The best advice I ever got was from John Sculley, who was president of Pepsi when I did the marketing there. John would tell me that he was an idea guy, that he would have 10 great ideas a week: One would be absolute genius, one would be absolute garbage, and the other eight would be somewhere in between.    The problem was, he said, it wasn't easy to tell which were which.    That's why I always ask for thoughtful, intelligent opinions on my ideas.

Mind you, we don't say it's authentic","excerpt":"we don't even say it's a fair account of the way our submariners live and fight on their Far Pacific patrols. Almost every fable which has yet come out about those fellows, along with a fantastic whopper which the boys at Warners dreamed up themselves, has been crammed into the two-hours-and-ten-minutes length of this film. Everything seems to happen to the men of the sub in this case, and they rise to the challenging occasions like the heroes of Hollywood that they are. Mind you, we don't say it is credible; we don't even suggest that it makes sense. But it does make a pippin of a picture, from a purely melodramatic point of view.For what the Warner people have fashioned in their characteristic hard-focus style, is a studiously purposeful \\"epic\\" of the submarine service in this war. And when those boys grit their teeth and go to it, an \\"epic,\\" by golly, it will be! In their \\"pig boat\\" which leaves San Francisco under sealed orders at the outset of this film—in the new and beautifully appointed U. S. S. Copperfin—is as lusty and typical a crew of sailors as the Warners ever shipped on from their casting list.There is Cary Grant as commander, a crisp, cool and kind-hearted gent who is every bit as resourceful as he is handsome and slyly debonair. There is John Garfield as a torpedoman with a great line of gab about \\"dames,\\" and Alan Hale as chief-cook, strong of lungs but oddly old for submarines. There is Dane Clark as a Greek boy who has a score to even up, and Tom Tully as an Irishman with a quiet religious faith. Then there is Robert Hutton as the inevitable nervous kid, and a dozen or more rugged fellows who look shipshape in the background.And scarcely has their sub cleared San Francisco before the tension and excitement begin with a crash dive and hiding under water from what later turns out to be a gull. But that is only the beginning. Sealed orders are broken out, and the Copperfin is instructed to proceed to—Tokyo Bay! More than that, it is to go by the Aleutians, there to pick up a meteorologist who is to be landed in Japan for the purpose of gauging the weather for a bombing raid on Tokyo!Those sound like sealed orders direct from Hollywood. But, at least, they provide for some remarkably heroic and suspenseful action stuff. The sub is attacked by Japanese warplanes in the Aleutians and gets a bomb in her deck; the skinniest man aboard her has to crawl in and de-fuse it—the nervous kid! The sub has to follow an enemy warship through the mine fields and net into Tokyo Bay and there put the weather observer ashore (though we don't just know why). While in Tokyo Bay, one of the crewmen—that nervous kid again—comes down with appendicitis and the pharmacist mate operates on him. (We know—you read about it in the papers; but it still seems odd to us that this sub should have all the best equipment except a modern surgical kit.)And then, to top things off, the Copperfin sinks an aircraft carrier outside Tokyo Bay and takes unquestionably the most terrific depth-bombing that has ever been played on the screen. The \\"tin cans\\" explode all around her; the men inside vibrate like Disney characters. The Warners really sweat you out with this one. When it's over, you and the crew have had enough.There is a whole lot more in the picture—all in that same general vein—and also some rather touching (albeit conventional) heart-throb stuff. The interior scenes are fascinating—the gadgets and all that sort of thing; and the undersea model work is graphic, for all its inside-the-Blue-Grott look.

The debaters quoted are Robert H. Bork, the former Federal judge (for the resolution), and Prof. Linda S. Greene of the University of Wisconsin Law School (against).   BORK -- Political correctness, I think, is something that is widespread in this society, and it's part of a mood of radical egalitarianism which has taken hold. Of course, equality does not occur for all people without coercion.  And I'm afraid that's what we're seeing. We're seeing it in affirmative action and quotas in the universities.  And we're seeing it in the speech codes, which are judging speech not by what it objectively means, but by how somebody perceives it, over which the speaker has no control.    And I think this kind of leveling in speech and of rejection of the achievement principle for quotas isn't going to work. This kind of thing, I think, leads to hostility, a loss of civility and a rejection of the achievement principle upon which this society is really based.   GREENE -- P.C. is a menace, but perhaps for different reasons than the other side would say. It's a menace because it obscures the real problems and issues that we face as a society.  It's a clever rhetorical phrase which turns a debate about racism and sexism into a debate about censorship.   If you can force us to discuss censorship instead of discussing racial epithets, censorship instead of discussing sexual harassment, censorship instead of discussing the question how we are going to transform our institutions into more diverse places, then you have set the terms of the debate and prevented a discussion of the real issues. And it seems to be a great cause of glee on the right, among conservatives, that they have been able to change this debate.    Let's stop attacking young people who come to college, whose parents send them to college with a reasonable expectation that they won't be the victims of racist, derogatory speech. Let's stop attacking the victims and start attacking the problem of racism. P.C. labels prevent that.  The P.C. charge prevents that, and that's why P.C. is a menace. Let's eliminate the phrase and get on with the unfinished business of transforming our society and transforming our educational institutions.   BORK -- Professor Greene, do you think there is more racism in this society today than there was 30 or 40 years ago?   GREENE -- I think that racism has changed its character. I think that racism still exists but its character is different. I think we have two types of racism going on, or at least two. In one type we see the explicit racist remark or the explicit racial decision, sometimes because of an inadvertent slip. Other times we have a veiled racism, not necessarily the product of a person's specific intent, but an unconscious comfort which we have with the status quo.    What we need to do is not to focus on calling each other racist or sexist, but instead to try to understand how historical racism has affected our lives and consciousness and not make charges but try to understand how we all -- white, black, men and women -- have been affected by our past.   BORK -- Professor Greene, I think none of us on this side of the table disagrees that people could be punished for making open racial or ethnic insults in a university. That is not the question in which this arises. This arises when students steal a student newspaper because they regard it as racist, although it's just conservative, or when a professor is put through sensitivity training for a remark that was not really offensive in the classroom, that's political correctness, and that's what we object to and it's happening. It's not just a question of forbidding talk about racism.   GREENE -- Well, is it political correctness because the university expresses a concern? It seems to me that if we eliminate the label of political correctness from our debate, we can talk more explicitly about what speech we want to empower people to engage in.   Let's stop talking about political correctness and instead talk frankly about what we want people to be able to say at the university. Are we saying that we want students to be able to say anything they wish to another person? Are we saying that we want faculty to be free to make remarks, however offensive or threatening to their students? Are we saying that we want professors to be able to make sexual remarks to their students?   All I am saying is that the P.C. charge prevents us from discussing the rules of decorum in the university. I think that when you mention acts like the stealing of newspapers  [ at Penn ]  or other acts of this nature, we all understand that these acts occur in a context. I don't think we want to continue to focus on these specific incidents. I think what we need to talk about is the way that the characterization of this debate prevents us from really discussing how much freedom a professor should -- we've both been professors. I'm a professor now.  You've been a professor. You know how important it is to be free to speak and to not be misunderstood.   BORK -- Nobody on this side of the table is saying we should not discuss racism or sexism and how to deal with it.   GREENE -- Judge Bork, don't you think that there is a great deal of hypocrisy in the free speech debate? We don't have an outcry over the regulation of speech in the context of stock offerings","excerpt":"we don't worry about regulating speech in the area of copyright, plagiarism.   Some of the conservatives are perfectly happy to suppress pornography and obscenity or other types of advertising. So how would you make the distinction between that speech which ought to be permitted and that speech which we ought to suppress?   BORK -- At the core of the First Amendment -- which I take it is the emblem of free speech in our society -- there is concern for political speech, concern for speech about ideas, about social matters, and so forth. There is no concern about speech -- at least there wasn't originally concern about speech which expresses no idea, but merely expresses hatred or obscenity or something of that sort.    If somebody says, for example, that Asian-American students turn out to be better at mathematics and physics than others, I take it a speech code might land them on that person.  That's political correctness, and that's wrong. We've got to be free to discuss differences, abilities, and so forth. But when you get to a code about a stock offering, you're merely saying don't sell somebody a product that you have lied about.   GREENE -- It seems that you're supporting the idea that we can regulate some hate speech ----   BORK -- In a university. In a university.   GREENE -- In the university. And hate speech which might be one person making a personally directed racial epithet at another person. Wouldn't you agree that that ought to be, if not punishable, certainly subject to some type of university discipline and correction?   BORK -- There certainly ought to be. I remember there was an episode at Brown University not long ago in which a drunken student went out in the quadrangle and shrieked anti-Semitic remarks, and the dean had him in and I think he was suspended. I don't have much trouble with that.    GREENE -- How do you explain that there is so much intellectual and political firepower marshaled in favor of people who want to yell epithets and derogatory, hurtful language?  How do we explain this marshaling of energy and intellect in support of people who want to act this way towards others?   BORK -- I think nobody does.   GREENE -- Well, then, would you agree with me that what we need to do is talk about the real issues and stop hurling our charges at each other?    BORK -- Oh, the charges are much more fun.

I had no interest in raising anything there; I wanted what came forth on its own urges -- deer, blackberries, turkeys, dogtooth violets -- to have free play. Working around a thicket of wild roses to loosen the fence, I saw the bright carcass of a six-point buck. Something had been eating it. From the fresh scratch marks on a fallen larch holding up the buck's rack, I knew it was the cougar.    Closer"},{"year":"1987","title":"LEAD: ''IT was the biggest family I ever belonged to.''

Dear Diary:     I'm glad I grew up when I did","excerpt":"we had so many experiences kids today can't know. With no VCR's or Nintendos, rainy-day creativity was forced on us. Dumbwaiter riding, for instance.   A dumbwaiter was an integral part of my old brownstone, built in the days when the formal dining room was above the kitchen and servants were a normal part of the household. Dumbwaiters were large wooden boxes recessed into the kitchen wall. When, during dinner, the mistress of the house pressed a foot buzzer, it alerted the downstairs maid, who placed the next course on the dumbwaiter and pulled it up on a pulley rope.   When I was 6 or 7, a friend dared me to crawl into the dumbwaiter, saying she would pull me up. And so a new amusement was born. It required a bit of courage for a small child, because total darkness prevailed during the journey down. If other friends came to visit, we put messages of great importance on the shelf and pulled them up. Parental objections were never a factor, mainly, I suspect, because they never knew of our escapades.   Dumbwaiter rides, one-way or round-trip, grew into a game we never tired of playing. What finally ended our dumbwaiter journeys was size. One had to be small to accomplish the ride and when we grew bigger, this giddy sport became part of our past.

Chicken soup is more than a meal  Chicken soup is religion you eat with a spoon.  Chicken soup is a very big deal.  Chicken soup was created when the first chicken  Met the first mom with a ladle.  From that came this elixer of life.  A potage for dotage and cradle.  Every culture and country says theirs is the greatest,  Every mother's, a haven from strife.  Whether she poured it straight from a can  Or gave it five years of life.  It's comfort and warmth, \\"Home\\" in a bowl.  The broth of gods, chicken scented.  The manna from Heaven would have been chicken soup,  But matzoh balls had not been invented.  Chicken soup's served with veggies, egg noodles and flanken  In cafes Chinese, French and Sri Lankan,  From Delhi to delis  It fills the world bellies  In L.A., Bombay and Man-hotten.  Chicken soup's made with kreplach, it's made with udon,  It's made with wontons and rice,  Of course, with the sacred matzoh ball,  And from cubes that can double as dice.  More than once it's been called \\"Jewish penicillin,\\"  Curing the ill, when germs are the villain.  For research has shown chicken soup may work best  When you shuffle from sick bed to kitchen,  Nose runny, bones shaking, your body all aching,  Eyes teary and red rimmed from itching.  Then someone must say, \\"Be careful it's hot,\\"  For that is the chicken soup prayer.  And you bow your head, and cozily slurp,  Knowing that chicken soup cares.  So if you're asked why  Chickens cross the road,  You will never be thrown for a loop.  You'll know it's all part of a master plan.  And the answer's as clear as your soup.

They are there for one purpose, to learn a particular skill, in their case, the art of per forming or composing.

At conservatories, the budding musicians are normally at college level and required to take standard liberal arts courses. Since be coming a pianist, violinist, singer, or what have you, takes so much dedication and time, these students are apt to resent the other areas of learning, finding them irrelevant. The Manhattan School of Music is trying to do some thing about this, and they have instituted this fall a Unified Academic Program.

And it has done so unfortunately, too. For the story which the picture ponderously tells should have made a delightful comedy—something closely resembling the memorable \\"Zwei Hertzen in Drei-Viertel Takt\\"—instead of the solemn, chest-heaving affair which it turns out to be.Here is a perfectly obvious little fable of a noted Viennese actor, favorite of his 1898 day, who happens to find himself in love during the afternoon of his life with a beautiful young girl. But the girl, appropriately, is in love with an aspiring actor of her own age, all unknown to the older man. Through the devices of a certain baroness, the young actor has an opportunity to play at the great Vienna Burgtheater, but the breath of scandal scotches this opportunity and all appears lost, until the older man makes the unselfish gesture and intervenes for the youngster. Thus he unites the young lovers and bids good-bye to his own fond dream.On the very face of it this is material for a nimble little comedy, all done up with nice music and a faintly sardonic touch.

The point was that a story was circulating (various unnamed bearers of it were alluded to) that Blair House had been ''bugged'' while the Reagans were staying there during their preinaugural/postelection visit to Washington; it was reported to be by virtue of a tape of such eavesdropping that Mrs. Carter learned that Mrs. Reagan wished the Carters would leave the White House sooner than scheduled - a story, incidentally, that we recall Mrs. Reagan herself denying at the time.

Mailbox:"},{"year":"1992","title":"As the taxi speeds, we pass the crumbling arches of the colonial houses that line the Malecon. Rubble lies in front of some. Others with no roofs or upper floors are held up by makeshift scaffolding. The frames of windows stand empty, open to the sky. On the lower floors, beneath the collapsed roofs, laundry hangs drying. A rooster struts on a Baroque balcony. Designed in 1857 by the Cuban engineer Gen. Franciso de Albear, the Malecon was at one time prime real estate - the seafront drive of Havanna. These formerly glorious houses were the dwellings of the privileged. Now as many as 10 families live in a single building among the ruins.    The fading crimson, sun-drenched yellow and cobalt blue facades provide the hint of a playful past, but now they look as if they haven't been painted since the dictator Fulgencio Batista fled in 1959. Later we learn that they are painted, but Cuba can't get seaworthy paint to protect the Malecon from ocean sprays. This doesn't explain the rubble, the ancient scaffolding. It's not clear whether things are being restored or just propped up.    Our car stops for a light (all the cars that don't carry tourists go through the light), and I gasp as a boy dives off the sea wall for his afternoon swim. Young men stroll, clasping the hands of their girlfriends who walk above them, along the sea wall, in what seems to be a courtship ritual, Havanna-style. Other people - almost exclusively young men - sit alone, facing the sea, looking north toward Florida. They appear as if they have nothing to do.    As we begin to drive again, the last light of day catches the Malecon. For an instant the facades become a burst of color and you can see a splendor that was.    IN 1962, I CLUTCHED A FRIEND'S HAND AS WE listened to John F. Kennedy call Castro's \\"bluff\\". Uncomprehending, we stared at my father who sat shaking his head. \\"What is it?\\" we asked. \\"Are we going to war?\\" \\"I'm not sure,\\" he muttered. \\"I just don't know.\\" Thus a curtain fell on an island to which one's parents sneaked away for a long weekend of gambling and frolic. America's playground, Cuba was called, a mere 90 miles from Key West, Fla. Now, flying down from Canada for a week's visit, it was to me a land cloaked in mystery, tinged with romance and rage.   At the bar of Havana's Hotel Inglaterra, where we are staying, black men in white linen suits with red ties, probably Jamaicans, are hunched over, doing business. My journalist husband and I have left our somewhat Spartan room, with its small balcony overlooking the Parque Central, to sip our first smooth rum drinks. A lone singer plays the maracas. Two little girls in yellow crinoline, hair braided, race to the adjoining dining room, recently refurbished to its former elegance of wrought iron and tile. Silverware clinks as waiters, who all seem to be named Ernesto or Fidel, serve grilled shrimp and sliced mangoes to German, French and Hispanic tourists, the majority of whom have that listless look that comes with the packaged tour. Cubans themselves almost never eat shellfish or swordfish, though their seas are rich in them. Highly valuable seafood is exported and the money goes to buy baby formula, among other things.   We pay for our drinks in dollars, just as we paid for our taxi ride. One can actually travel throughout Cuba and never need to change money, except perhaps to buy a newspaper or ride a bus. Faced with the loss of Soviet aid and the dire need for hard currency, Cuba has turned to tourism. And everything in the tourist economy is done in hard currency. Meanwhile, we are told over and over again, it is forbidden for Cubans to own dollars or even to enter the stores that carry the items that dollars will buy.   AS WE VENTURE OUT, IT IS dark and a different reality greets us. Boys beg for Chiclets and pens, \\"Please for school","excerpt":"we have nothing to write with.\\" When I part with my lone Bic, the boy races off without a word. At a counter to the left of the hotel where tourists dine, a long line forms. People lean against a wall, arms folded, resignation in their eyes. They are waiting for \\"pizza,\\" thick dough with a glop of cheese and some sauce on it, which is what their pesos will buy. Grease oozes through the paper wrappers; no one seems eager to eat.   Crossing the Prado, we head through the Parque Central and up Empedrado Street. A stray dog wanders into the road, without peril.  Even on this main drag there are virtually no cars because gasoline is very scarce.   We enter the maze of streets of Old Havana, lighted by occasional street lights, but guards -- either regular police or the local Committee of the Defense of the Revolution -- are everywhere. We feel safe, but also ill at ease. We gaze into rooms where men stare at bargain-basement television sets that offer generic soap operas or predigested news.   The streets themselves are oddly devoid of life. There are no shops, no grocery stores. No restaurants or places to eat. Nowhere to go except where we are going, the Bodeguita del Medio (literally little grocery store in the middle). Hemingway had a phrase about this restaurant that has been immortalized on a plaque in the bar, \\"My daiquiri in the Floridita, my mojito in the Bodeguita.\\" Here we dine on rice and beans (the best I've ever had), excellent roast chicken, fried plantains and, of course, those rum mint juleps known as mojitos. We are serenaded by state-paid troubadours who sing Latin love songs. During our trip all we will hear are love songs.   CALLE OBISPO RUNS from the Plaza de Armas to the Floridita bar. In the morning, the darkness and mystery of Old Havana lift, and the ubiquitous lines form. Cubans, ration books in hand, stand in line for about 5 eggs a week, a chicken every 10 days, a liter of milk a day if they have small children. The lines seem to move faster than they do in Russia, and the Cubans are jovial. They talk as they wait, often of the shortages. One toothless old woman walks away, shaking her head. No potatoes that day, but her shopping bag is full of oranges and bananas.   We stop at a cigar factory to buy some cigars, and learn that we can take a tour of the state-of-the-art facility. The workers, we are told, work eight hours a day, get six months paid maternity leave, lifetime guaranteed employment and a full pension after the age of 55, if they so choose. I ask a woman who must be close to 60 how long she has worked (23 years in the factory) and how long she plans to continue. She dances a rumba for me in her seat, \\"As long as I'm moving,\\" she says. Her job is to put the little bands around the cigars.   After a visit to the Museum of the Revolution, which occupies the former Presidential Palace -- the exhibition begins, without irony, with Columbus -- we head to the coffee shop of the Riviera Hotel.   If I were to make a movie about Las Vegas in the 1950's, I'd film it in Havana -- at the Floridita or at the Riviera, Meyer Lansky's old casino. Havana itself is a kind of period piece, a kind of living museum. What few individually owned cars are on the streets are all preblockade -- De Sotos, Hudsons, Edsels, Chevrolets, painted iridescent gold and black or red and white, puttering along on what should be their last legs. The Riviera, too, is vintage 50's, the real thing. Now a hotel, its casinos have been turned into cabarets and a spacious lobby with starry light fixtures and a silver bank of elevators.   We order sandwiches and malteds, which are thick and smooth. Our waiter, who sees me scribbling, asks what I am doing. I tell him, which I do not tell everyone, that I am an American journalist. He then launches into a brief history of Cuban socialism and his theory of the current economic crisis. He explains that the Cubans have food, but it is bad food. Fastidious people that they are, they have no soap.   He leans over my arm. \\"You want to write something about Cuba, just go into a hospital,\\" he says, \\"See what kind of care we really get. I don't mean the tourists who come for marrow transplants or heart surgery, but the Cubans. But don't tell anyone I told you. They'll put me in jail.\\" We give him four bars of the Ivory soap that we were told to carry with us and he thanks us profusely.   HAT EVENING \\"SUENO Tropical\\" (\\"Tropical Dream\\") is playing near our hotel and we decide to go see it. But just as we are about to change money (the only time we try to do so), a tour arrives and we cannot get near the Inglaterra's front desk. We ask the bartender if she will give us some change in pesos, because we want to go to the movie. She has seen it, and says it is very funny, but she cannot give us change in pesos. Instead, she hands us a napkin enclosing a three-peso note (worth about $3.75). \\"I am not changing the money,\\" she tells us emphatically. \\"This is a gift from me.\\" We leave her a $5 tip.   The movie, made in Cuba, is, to our surprise, a spoof on gender relations -- an abusive husband dreams his wife goes off to work every day while he stays home with the baby. The film opens with a pregnant woman giving a man her seat on a bus. The theater is packed, and the Cubans never stop laughing.   After much difficulty and expense (Cuba does not provide incentives for the individual tourist), we rent a car and head east toward Trinidad, the old colonial city of smugglers and pirates. Along the way we pause for a visit to the Hemingway House in San Francisco de Paula. Hemingway bequeathed this house to Cuba, and it is much as he left it. Set in a grove of bamboo and palm trees, draped in bougainvillea, it feels as if Hemingway has just gone out fishing and will be back in time for his mojitos.   One of the woman guards and I strike up a conversation. She was a young girl and a neighbor when Hemingway lived there. \\"The last time I saw him was in the summer of 1960. He was walking through town and he was quite mad.\\" She pauses, blushing slightly, \\"But he was a man, let me tell you that. He was really a man.\\"   We head south. Bougainvillea lines the median strip. Sweet-smelling fields thick with sugar cane and plantains extend on either side. Oxen plow the fields, though this is to save gasoline. Indeed, we have the highway almost to ourselves. A few guaguas (public buses) pass. One is broken down by the side of the road. The right lane of traffic on the main freeway out of Havana is being used by bicycles (Cuba recently imported 500,000 of them from China) and hitchhikers. Pickup trucks carry workers from place to place and whenever one pulls up dozens pile on.   In the distance the cane fields are being burned. Dark smoke fills the sky. More smoke comes from the cane factories. We leave the main road and journey into the countryside, but the map grows vague. Roads are paved, but have no names. They are dotted with piglets and schoolchildren in their red-and-white uniforms (literacy of those under 30 is said to be almost 100 percent). We are lost, so we pick up our first hitchhikers -- a young couple with a baby, heading in the direction of Cruces. He speaks a Spanish I can barely comprehend, but I learn that he works in the cane factories and owns his own house. We leave them at Cruces and make our way to Cumanayagua, where the road divides. We've been driving for almost six hours when I stop an old woman for directions. She speaks for a long time, and I nod, but then I sink into the car. My husband says, \\"Well, which way?\\"   \\"I didn't understand a word she said.\\" It is the low moment of the trip.   \\"Try again,\\" he says.   I get out and several men come up. They gesticulate wildly, measuring turns, dips in the road. I follow their hands along imaginary roads. We drive on by the seat of our pants, past an alpine lake in a valley among mountains. There are no road signs and a mountain range is ahead of us. We are low on gas. Buzzards eating road kills take flight as we drive past. Boys gallop by on horseback, ignoring a cow that stands in the middle of the road. We pick up an old man who is going to Trinidad. He has spent the day cleaning fish, and the stench is nearly unbearable.   We deposit him in downtown Trinidad where we're told there is a hotel, but we find nothing. We head for the Ancon, the large tourist hotel on the beach, where the food is self-service and the furniture glorified Best Western. It is packed with English-speaking tourists from Montreal. The sand seems to be imported from elsewhere. We are there 10 minutes when the lights go out for the evening.   In the morning we visit old Trinidad and its magnificently refurbished Spanish colonial houses, complete with 19th-century plumbing. Then we head back across the country, toward Cuba's northern beaches. We are not far out of Trinidad when we pick up a grandmother carrying milk from her cow to her new grandson in Cienfuegos. At the crossroads to Cienfuegos she gets out. \\"Can somebody help these people get to Abreus?\\" she shouts. Three people who don't know one another, two men and a woman, all jump in. Only the woman, a nurse, is going as far as Abreus, where she tells us there is a fiesta going on.   At Abreus, we park near the main plaza, which is decorated with palm fronds; the usual music blares. Cubans slurp ice slush and sway to the music, a kind of salsa rap. In an alleyway is a broken-down carousel, its wooden horses like a child's drawing, hand-carved. We stroll down a dirt road where the houses are all primitive, in some cases with thatched roofs, but very clean and well kept. A sign in front of one reads, \\"Don't tie your horses here.\\" In each home, as a kind of centerpiece, a television set, compliments of the revolution, stands.   IN THE MIDST OF MILES and miles of orange groves on the road north, we pick up a young woman with pink shoes, giant earrings and blonde hair with dark roots. She is going to Cardenas and will send us on to Varadero.   Our rider is chatty and good spirited and we begin to talk. I ask her where she lives and where she works. \\"I live in Cardenas, but I work where you picked me up.\\"   \\"It's a long commute,\\" I say.   \\"Yes, it takes two hours, each way, but there is no work in Cardenas.\\"   \\"What do you do?\\"   \\"I'm a dentist. Actually I'm a cranial surgeon, but I do dentistry.\\"   I look at this young woman in pink shoes.  \\"You're a surgeon?\\" She nods. \\"Isn't there some easier way for you to get to work?\\"    She shrugs. \\"Oh, people know me, they pick me up. It's not so bad.\\"   \\"You don't feel . . . inconvenienced?\\" I ask hesitantly.   \\"Oh, it is temporary,\\" she says. \\"We have to work hard to overcome this period in our history.\\"   \\"Well what do you think is going to happen here -- with Fidel.\\"   \\"Oh, I hope nothing. I love Fidel,\\" she says as if she is referring to her boyfriend. (We know, however, that one can go to jail for a long time for \\"insulting\\" Fidel and the jails, we have heard, are full.) \\"My country has given me my education, my work, my house. All the patients I treat are treated for free. I hope he lives 20 more years.\\"   VARADERO IS ON A LONG narrow peninsula on Cuba's northern coast, with the sea on one side and a bay on the other, somewhat like Palm Beach, Fla., geographically speaking. But the comparison stops there. While it is a strip of fairly fancy hotels with elaborate facilities -- hotels that serve the Canadian and European tourists who come for their winter holidays, most of whom fly into Varadero and stay put -- it is peculiarly devoid of commercialism. There are the generic Intur tiendas, which sell the same rum and cigars and chocolates and shoes throughout Cuba. There are a few beach barbecues, but basically what you have in Varadero, besides a kind of funky Cuban version of Club Med, is a pristine turquoise sea and a white beach, the real thing.   I ask for a room with a view of the sea at the Punta Blanca, an older hotel, and we are given a stuffy room with no balcony, over a noisy discotheque. Knowing the language is helpful here. I return to the desk clerk, an unenthusiastic worker, and say, \\"We have come a long way and we are very tired, and we'd like something a little more comfortable.\\"   So she hands me a key that opens a small house with a wraparound porch that sits at the edge of the sea. Next door is Al Capone's old guesthouse, a magnificent stone structure with French windows and wide stone arches that face the sea. It has been turned into an around-the-clock bar, and we beat a path between our house and Al Capone's.   We dine at a Creole restaurant where we see the one phrase of public social protest we will see on our entire trip. Graffitied across a poster is Fidel's revolutionary motto, \\"Socialismo o Muerte,\\" revised to read \\"Fettucini o Muerte.\\" We eat swordfish while the pre-paid musicians play love songs. A handsome young Cuban joins in with bongos and his lover, a European tourist with a cowbell, tries to keep up her end of the percussion. But then a drunk old man with a Hatuey beer in each fist sings some prerevolutionary decadent lyrics and the restaurant claps along.   HAT NIGHT EL NORTE blows in; the seas rise. In the morning it is cold and jellyfish line the beach. We walk, bundled up, while undaunted French tourists, bodies greased, sunbathe bare-breasted along the shore. When we return to our room, the maid has folded our towels into swans and my husband refuses to disturb them.   The next afternoon, a man who works at the hotel approaches us. \\"Please, I want to ask you a favor,\\" he says. \\"Could you go into the tienda for me; I want to buy a pair of red shoes for my little girl.\\" He displays dollars in his hands. Then he shows us a slip of paper, about four inches long. \\"That is the size of her foot,\\" he says. \\"And I have another little girl.\\" He adds two fingers to the piece of paper. \\"This size.\\"   \\"You can't go buy them yourself? With dollars?\\"    He puts his fingers to his lips. \\"I can't even have dollars, but we all keep some of our tips, everyone does it. Can you do this? As a favor?\\"   It is this slip of paper cut to the size of his child's foot that wins me over. The woman who works in the tienda knows just what shoes, what size. She gives us a knowing nod as we leave.   UR LAST NIGHT IN Havana we join a group of German tourists, who keep tapping their watches, unaccustomed to Latin time, as we await the bus to take us to a cabaret. At last it pulls up. The automatic doors fling open and there, sprawled across the paunch of our aging driver are a pair of long black legs, a white skirt hiked up high to the thighs. The woman pulls down her skirt and rises with stunning indifference. \\"Tropicana,\\" she says, shuffling into her tour director's seat.   The Tropicana has been in continuous operation since 1939. Neither war nor revolution has changed it or stopped it. Arriving, we file past a fountain with statues of nude nymphets dangling bunches of grapes. Mirrors are everywhere. For several hours the rum flows at $5 a shot and the girls, dressed in G-strings and spangles, kick and writhe and gyrate. The audience of former Eastern bloc and future European community members offers perfunctory applause and after the 25-minute finale files out despondently.   We return to the bus where our tour director in her white skirt sits smoking a cigarette. The driver drives so slowly that the Afro-Cuban dolls on his dash barely budge.   We cruise the Malecon at a snail's pace. The sea calm, the moon full, it is cast in blue like an opera set. Inside the dark stairwells of what appear to be abandoned buildings lights flicker. Two people embrace. I peer up toward the collapsed roofs and missing top floors and there, through the empty window frames, I see the stars. SOME WORDS OF CAUTION      The Cuban tourist industry is designed to keep you on the tourist trail. If you follow it, Cuba will appear more or less like any other place. But if you deviate or scratch the surface, you may see that all is not as it might appear.   One morning before breakfast I placed two phone calls -- one to our daughter in Florida, the other to a former close associate of Fidel Castro's, in Havana, whose number had been given to me. The calls were put through without any difficulty, though the operator made an audible gulp when I said \\"Florida.\\" Afterward, my husband and I went for a morning stroll along the Prado, stopping for a cup of coffee. Then we returned to our room to leave our sweaters.   We came upon the maid in the vestibule in front of our room. She stared at us, wide-eyed. The door was open, and another maid stood in the doorway. \\"Good morning,\\" we said. They didn't say anything, which is unusual in Cuba. We walked in to find a man with a razor blade in one hand and a pencil in the other. With the pencil, he was literally tapping the phone.   \\"Is something the matter?\\" I asked.   The man looked up, startled but smiling. \\"Inventory,\\" he said. He had a computer printout with him, and some small silver tags.   \\"Oh,\\" I smiled. My husband stared at me, lips pursed. The man and the two maids quickly left the room.   Later, over lunch, when we mentioned to the former Castro associate that we suspected that our phone might be tapped, she just nodded. \\"Probably,\\" she said. Never discuss money on the phone, she told us. Or anything of substance. Certainly not politics or whom we might be seeing.   On another occasion we met an Ethiopian man with a Canadian passport who was traveling with two white Canadian friends. He told us, \\"Everywhere I go I am stopped; they pull me over and say, 'What are you doing with tourists?' I tell them that I    am    a tourist. When they see my passport, they let me go.\\" MARY MORRIS RULES AND REGULATIONS      Although Cuba is constructing new hotels, often as joint ventures with European hotel companies, few Americans are signing the guest registers. Under sanctions imposed by the United States Government, American citizens, while technically free to travel to Cuba, are prohibited from spending any money there unless they are journalists, scholars or Cuban-Americans visiting family members who live on the island. These regulations are backed up by penalties of up to 12 years in prison and $250,000 in fines, although to date no individual traveler has been penalized.   Some back doors are open, however. SUN HOLIDAY TOURS, Post Office Box 531, Montego Bay, St. James, Jamaica (telephone: 809-952-5629), offers day trips from Montego Bay for $177 a person. The excursions depart every Wednesday, and the price includes round-trip air fare, in-flight snacks, an airport reception and transportation to, and a city tour of, Santiago de Cuba. And, for those who wish to bend the rules, package trips to Cuba can be booked through Canadian travel agencies. Some typical prices for seven-night packages offered by AIR CANADA VACATIONS, the major purveyor of such trips, range from about $350 a person, including air fare between Montreal and Varadero Beach and accommodations in a standard beachfront hotel, such as the Punta Blanca, to about $590 a person for air fare and a suite in the new Melia Varadero Hotel. Meal packages (breakfast and dinner daily) are an additional $119 a person, and service charges add another $109 each. Day trips to Havana can be arranged.   A recorded advisory concerning travel to Cuba (and many other countries) is available from the State Department: 202-647-5225.
