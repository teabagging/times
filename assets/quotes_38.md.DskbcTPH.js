The continuing strike severely disrupted rehearsals of the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France. The orchestra itself is not on strike, but the staff that transports its instruments is. The situation prompted the Théâtre du Châtelet to replace the Philharmonique with the Orchestre Lamoureux, Paris's oldest orchestra. ''In France, the right to strike is established,'' said François Boudeau, a Théâtre du Châtelet press officer. ''Radio France employees have their claims, and that's normal. At the same time, this situation shows how dynamic our theater is. We found a solution within 24 hours.'' Performances on April 17, 21 and 23 remain on the schedule. ''The Bassarids,'' composed in 1966, is based on a script by W.H. Auden and Chester Kallman. Produced by Yannis Kokkos and conducted by Kazushi Ono, it stars the soprano June Anderson and the tenor Kim Begley.

For them, strikes -- the few that they try -- are becoming a different animal.   The press coverage of the 760 striking players is prolific. And since many lives are touched by the absence of baseball in August, the players have leverage. But contrast that with another old-time strike. Nearly 8,000 workers walked out in July at four tire manufacturers. These companies account for nearly 10 percent of all American-made tires. But who hears much about their plight?

But sometimes music reaches out to engage the larger issues of the day, reminding us of the links between esthetic pleasure and political concern. Just now, several otherwise unrelated events have pointed up the curiously ambivalent relationship between art-music and politics.   Those events began on May 25 with a memorial concert at Symphony Space for Cornelius Cardew, a British composer killed in a hit-andrun accident in London last December. Mr. Cardew had evolved, with an inexorable, seemingly self-punishing logic, from the chilly rigor of total Serialism to the libertine anarchism of John Cage to a determined, neo-folkish simplicity inspired by Marxist-Leninism.   His music never made much of a dent on its own, and after the May 25 concert, it does not seem very likely that it will. But the concert attracted a wide range of new-music composers and performers both on the stage and in the audience. Mr. Cardew's appeal to them must have been more as a moral example than as a compositional model. No matter why they came, however, their presence focused attention on the growing accessibility and, hence, potential for politicization of the younger musical avant-garde.

In the course of Ingmar Bergman's staging of Strindberg's \\"Miss Julie,\\" that light will go through many subtle changes, counterpointing the emotional turbulence of the characters onstage. Their duel is a class war as well as a fierce battle of the sexes.   Despite all the portent, the play never loses its personal dimension, its sense of wounds mutually inflicted. Strindberg called \\"Miss Julie\\" a naturalistic tragedy, a fact that has never been so evident as in Mr. Bergman's stunning production. This is the opening play of the Royal Dramatic Theater of Sweden's all too brief season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

As Carey Perloff's taut production at the CSC Theater reminds one, the play is a tragi-comedy. Written in 1888, the same year as \\"Miss Julie,\\" \\"Creditors\\" derives from the author's early naturalistic phase. But beneath the tangible surface are symbolic undercurrents about diseased marriage and the distortions of various creative acts.   Two of the three characters are artists: a painter turned sculptor and his wife, who is a writer. The third, mysterious figure is an artist with words, which he uses to intrude into the couple's relationship. When the wife is away, this stranger (Zach Grenier) insinuates himself and becomes the husband's first friend outside of his marriage. Then he tortures him into self-doubt about his role as artist and husband.

Approaching their silver wedding anniversary, Edgar and Alice are living in a house that was once a prison on a remote island garrison, isolated and ostracized by the rest of the community, comfortable in their mutual scorn.

During the last 25 years, his plays -- 40 of them since he originated his Ontological-Hysteric Theater -- have repeatedly analyzed the imbalances between art and life. Even while he has branched out to become a director of opera and plays by others, his contribution remains instantly identifiable. Whatever he does, he leaves sight and sound tracks as his signature, and his art has always had a deeply intellectual foundation.   In rehearsal at St. Mark's Theater with his new play, \\"My Head Was a Sledgehammer,\\" Mr. Foreman is at the electronic controls, interjecting suggestions to his actors and orchestrating the mechanics of the enterprise.

There was a collection of Peanuts strips published four or five years ago by Holt, Rinehart & Winston, and come October 2&#8212;which by no chance whatsoever is 25 years to the day from the first appearance of Peanuts in the papers &#8212;Holt will bring out the most ambitious hardcover Peanuts yet. This is a coffee table book called &#8220;Peanuts Jubilee,&#8221; and will consist of the best Peanuts strips over the years as selected by their progenitor, Charles Schultz. As it turned out, though, the book is more than a collection, for it also contains Mr. Schultz's autobiography. Originally he was supposed to write only some caption material but, according to Holt publicity director John Taylor, once he got started, he couldn't stop. Known as an intensely private man, Mr. Schultz nonetheless wrote a 20,000&#8208;word account of his life and career and &#8220;he would have written 100,000 words,&#8221; if they had let him, Mr. Taylor said. Also included in the book are various Schultz&#8208;Peanuts memorabilia; such as his early commercial, art, pages from a World War II sketchbook and other drawings. Holt obviously expects Peanuts fans to sit up and take notice; the first printing is 100.000 copies&#8212;high for a $35 book ($29.95 until Dec. 31).

Their regular meals usually consist of mackerel, vitamin supplements and salt tablets, meeting the polar-bear administration's minimum daily requirements. During a recent feeding Ida and Lily, weighing in at about 450 pounds each, demonstrated Baryshnikovian grace as they delicately pawed the water for blocks that had slipped away. Gus, at 700 pounds, went through the motions of trying to steal Ida's apple, but then quickly gave up and fell asleep. If you've never seen polar bears sit, take lessons from Gus as he slides his hefty, swaying haunches onto the rocks as if he were sledding. The feedings, which can be viewed from several points, are at 11:15 A.M., 1 and 3:30 P.M. Zoogoers can also check out the regular penguin feedings at 10:45 A.M and 2:30 P.M. in the indoor section of Polar Circle, as well as hear winter storytelling in the Wildlife Conservation Center at 2:30 and 3:30 P.M. Admission to the zoo, open from 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M., is $1 for adults, 25 cents for children 3 to 12, free for those under 3. Restrooms and a clean, comfortable cafeteria are on the premises","excerpt":"strollers, except in the Polar Circle (they can be stashed outside the door), are welcome. 'Alice in Wonderland'  John Houseman Theater  450 West 42d Street  (212) 496-5710 (group)  (212) 564-8038 (Hit-Tix)  Recommended ages: 2 and up  Through Jan. 1    The holiday production of the master puppeteer Bil Baird's marionettes is a simple, truly childlike presentation of the Lewis Carroll classic that never tires. The puppet set is small and sits on a larger stage, so the closer seats are best. Though Baird died in 1987, his wooden marionettes continue, after 50 years (now under the supervision of his puppeteer son, Peter Baird), to endear themselves to the imaginations of the younger set. In \\"Alice,\\" whose namesake has such enormous blue eyes they almost swallow her up, Tweedledum and Tweedledee are talented tap dancers and the crimson-lipped Queen, prone to beheading the impertinent, has a serious case of Locust Valley lockjaw herself. All the clear and resounding voices are those of the puppeteers working unseen above, except for the Mock Turtle's, the Walrus's and the Caterpillar's, which are Bil Baird, taped. A 10-minute intermission is just long enough to meander to the restrooms and the water fountain. Matinees are at 12:30 and 3 P.M. Try to arrive on time, or you might be seated at the theater's discretion until intermission; there is no place to check strollers. Tickets are $17.50 for the 90-minute show, which includes an informal 15-minute puppet pageant in which the audience is asked to clap and sing. Santa Claus  Various Manhattan locations Through Dec. 24 (except for the World Trade Center)    Sanity seems to be prevailing at most of the Santa spots around Manhattan. Be prepared, however, to wait in line for at least 10 minutes. The estimated waits are based on previous weekend timings and on projections, with the imminence of Christmas Day kept in mind. This survey was compiled to help you decide where to take your children -- of all ages, whether they believe or not -- to talk to Santa. Macy's Broadway and 34th Street (212) 560-4495    Santa has a covey of elves here shepherding you and the children through a bedazzling Santaland that outshines those of the other department stores in Manhattan. Unfortunately, the line is the longest. Actually, there are two lines (they do accommodate strollers): one to visit Santa and the other to peek at him, thereby separating the diehards from the voyeurs. At about 1,500 people an hour at peak times for both lines, the visit through the maze offers close-up views of holiday scenes, including the intricately designed wooden-toy factory. The peeking line provides faraway views. Let your conscience be your guide. Where: eighth floor, center of store. When: today through Sunday, 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.; Monday, 8 A.M. to 6:30 P.M. Peak times: all day. Santa's break: none. Wait: about 45 minutes to an hour for the Santa visit and 15 minutes for a peek. Snapshots: $9 to $25. Bloomingdale's Lexington Avenue at 59th Street (212) 705-2206    Bloomingdale's \\"Visit With Santa\\" has the market on pop-art decor, with its neon-colored cardboard trees on walls covered with happy faces. So if you're seeking tradition, seek elsewhere. Santa does, however, sit on a traditionally styled throne, wears granny glasses and gives away crayons and coloring books while ringing out a robust \\"Ho, ho, ho.\\" Where: second floor, toy department. When: 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. daily. Peak times: noon to 2 P.M. Santa's break: 2 to 3 P.M. Wait: about a half-hour. Snapshots: $6.49 to $17.99. A. & S. Plaza Avenue of the Americas at 33d Street (212) 465-0500    Featuring what seems to be the only Santa with a natural white beard in town, the scene here is one of relative serenity, probably because he can be found at the heart of the food stalls, surrounded by plenty of tables and chairs. Santa is underneath the garland-trimmed gazebo, up a few marble steps, on his red and gold throne. Where: seventhh floor, at the western end of the mall. When: 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. daily. Peak times: 12:30 to 4 P.M. Santa's break: around 2 P.M. Wait: about 15 minutes. Snapshots: $3 to $20. World Trade Center Twin Tower 2 (212) 466-7397    The most breathtaking Santa can be found on the Observation Deck atop this head-in-the-clouds tower; he seems to have flown in on a red and gold sleigh. And if he doesn't respond to all of your children's requests, at least he can promise a panoramic view of parts of New Jersey, Brooklyn and Staten Island, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and the Statue of Liberty, a beacon for other cruising Santas. Where: 107th floor, southwest corner. When: today through Sunday, 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Peak times: 11 A.M. to 2 P.M. Santa's break: 1 to 2 P.M. Wait: about 20 minutes. Snapshots: bring your own camera or videocam recorder. Admission fees: adults, $3.50; children 6 to 12, $1.75, and under 6, free. Saks Fifth Avenue Fifth Avenue at 50th Street (212) 753-4000    On a red dais and comfortable on a tartan throne, Saks's Santa appears unharried and avuncular, surrounded by stuffed Babars and other soft animals. In this orderly, simplified setting, the short wait, promises Susan Boyer, group manager of the children's department, could very well save you from despair. Where: eighth floor, children's department. When: today and tomorrow, 9:30 A.M. to 8:30 P.M.; Sunday, 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. and Monday, 10 A.M. to 6:30 P.M. Peak times: noon to 2 P.M. Santa's break: 10 minutes every couple of hours. Wait: about 10 minutes. Snapshots: $8. United States Capitol Lego Model  A. & S. Plaza  Avenue of the Americas and 33d Street  Recommended ages: 4 and up  Through Jan. 1    This white behemoth model of the classical Capitol building might not be easy to replicate in your home, but at least by seeing it, you and the children will know that it can be done, if you've got a yearlong vacation coming up. Part of a traveling exhibition, the Capitol was made by the company's master model builders in Connecticut and Denmark. Glue keeps the parts together, which were all assembled by hand. Don't bother to peer inside: everyone's gone home. If you fill out the forms on the table, guessing how many Legos make up the model, you may win $100 worth of -- need you ask -- Legos.

Its main section consists of 22 facades, each roughly three stories high, and each designed by a prominent architect as a representation of his work.   Not quite real buildings, of course: stage sets is more like it, since these facades are made of inexpensive materials, have no backs, and give entry to relatively anonymous spaces behind. But they are still an overwhelming, and surprisingly exhilarating, presence.  They are so big that they could fit into no conventional museum space, and they have thus been lined up as a mock street inside a pier at Fort Mason Center beside San Francisco Bay.
