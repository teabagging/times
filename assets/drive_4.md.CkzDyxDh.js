But if you attempted to cash a $50 traveler's check at any Anchor Savings Bank branch in New York you might very well be turned away - even if you could document your identity thoroughly.   The two situations illustrate a dilemma that the issuers of traveler's checks are facing these days. The financial organizations that issue them insist that all anyone need do before accepting a traveler's check is to watch it being countersigned and compare the signatures, and the issuing company will guarantee payment. But more and more banks, merchants, gasoline stations, hotels and restaurants are refusing to take the issuers at their word.   For consumers, this means that it is often not as simple as it once was to use traveler's checks, although ultimately, in most places, they will be accepted. Most hotels and restaurants in the United States, as they traditionally have, readily accept them as payment, simply asking you to sign them, nothing more. But the wise traveler will carry the best possible identification, anyway, because more and more banks and retail establishments require it.
