The comment may be taken as a sly aside about the play in which the line is spoken, for ''The Importance of Being Earnest'' is a matter of absolutely no importance, and style is therefore vital in its presentation. In the critic Louis Kronenberger's description, ''It is all surface, even in its satire","excerpt":"all prankishness, even in its fantasy.'' Out of nonsense about a misplaced child who is found, an invented brother who becomes real, two young women who sigh over the name ''Ernest'' and confrontations involving muffins and cucumber sandwiches, Oscar Wilde created his masterpiece.

Renamed after months of renovations that took place while many guests had to maneuver a hotel lobby that looked, at times, like a construction site, the chic new 74-room Sunset Tower hotel does hark back to the golden era when this Art Deco landmark was an apartment building housing the likes of Bugsy Siegel (evicted for gambling), Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe. But the old-school décor and pretensions come with lackluster service.    THE SCENE -- The striped silk-and-walnut Tower Bar restaurant is already a retro clubhouse for the mature Hollywood set (think Brian Grazer and Barbara Walters), complete with $13 martinis and the octogenarian former Sinatra pianist Page Cavanaugh tickling the ivories. On a Friday night in mid-December, Anjelica Huston and Courtney Love swanned by to dine with a 30-something crowd far more sophisticated than the teenyboppers roaming Sunset Boulevard outside. Eating dinner as a noncelebrity is another matter. Though we arrived promptly for our 8:30 p.m. reservation, we weren't seated until 10:10, our cocktails were never replenished, and, once we seated, our entire meal lasted less than half an hour, as the busboy swept our table clean before we had a chance to order dessert. No martini can dull that frustration -- though our appetizers, served in the bar as we waited for our table, were provided free by the somewhat apologetic maître d'hôtel.    THE LOCATION -- Smack dab in the middle of the Sunset Strip, across from the Saddle Ranch Chop House and a Hyatt, and countless clubs and restaurants. Request a room on the upper floors to avoid the street noise","excerpt":"all rooms, though, have panoramic views of Los Angeles.    THE ROOMS -- The standard rooms aren't huge by Los Angeles standards, but aren't tiny either. What they lack is any logic. Even though the décor is understated and refined -- polished dark wood set off by brass, peach and silver linens, silk-covered lamps, and framed stills from classic movies on the walls -- why is the desk placed directly in front of the flat-screen television -- and why is there no desk chair? And the turn-down service missed our room, leaving us with an overstuffed bolster on the king-size bed, but no pillows. Tired, we didn't call down about it.    BATHROOMS -- The glass-fronted shower would be a winner -- with its rainshower head and bench -- if the water had warmed beyond tepid. Oh, and a bathtub? Not in our room, though others have them. All that golden stone looks pretty though; and the Bigelow lavender-peppermint products were worth taking home. (The hotel is changing to Kiehl's toiletries.)    AMENITIES -- The minibar is stocked with top-shelf liquor and one lonely Snickers bar. There's free Wi-Fi and an iPod docking station. Downstairs, the Argyle Spa is a limestone oasis for $190 massages and $240 Romanian mud masks. The pool, closed for renovation during our stay, is now open, along with a hotel gym.    ROOM SERVICE -- Breakfast arrived in a pokey 35 minutes, but was hot and delicious. It had better be, when you're paying $16 for a bowl of oatmeal and $4.50 for a cup of coffee, with a built-in 15 percent tip. We also paid a $2.50 room-service charge, which the hotel says will soon be dropped. The room-service menu replicates that of the Tower Bar ($32 for seared monkfish, $17 for a turkey sandwich). When we called down for an extra plate and fork, we had to call twice and wait 20 minutes.    BOTTOM LINE -- The Sunset Tower looks like a classy joint; and at $269 for a standard room, it's decently priced (as long as you don't eat). But would Sinatra put up with the half-baked details?

Calling his victory at the Grand Slam Cup a \\"little event,\\" this kid, at 19 years old, pocketed twice as much as I can expect to make in my entire lifetime (\\"Sampras Says He's Seeking a Prize Loftier Than Money,\\" Dec. 19). Maybe he's onto something.   As a senior struggling through the end of finals at an \\"elite\\" college, I believe the message is clear: Why bother with all-nighters in the library and coffee-induced stomach cramps? Who needs sociology and chemistry? By avoiding college altogether, and keeping his hair trimmed, Sampras receives a level of respect and reward denied to almost everyone else in his age group.   But wait, some might say. As a graduate of an Ivy League school, you have gained valuable knowledge that will serve both you and society. You have the potential to do great deeds, to help the unfortunate, to serve the nation","excerpt":"all Sampras can do is ace Lendl. You can pursue a higher calling and become a professor or a civil servant, thus deriving immense personal satisfaction. You may be right, I reply.   But even Sampras strives for more than money, or the momentary glory of basking on center court. \\"It's being a part of history,\\" he says, explaining his decision to spend his life mercilessly pummeling rubber balls. I doubt I'll spend the rest of my life foaming at the mouth and cursing Sampras's name. My resentment is not personal; he works hard at his job, and he seems sincere about wanting more than money. But that does not make the situation any less galling.   A nation facing a spiraling deficit, cities plagued by AIDS and crack, and an \\"education president\\" who seems to have amnesia might understandably seek solace by turning to the diversion of sports events. Until society recognizes the vital importance of encouraging and rewarding those who attempt to grapple with events more pressing than an overhead smash, the example set by Sampras and others will lead to a generation seeking fame and fortune, starry-eyed, blind to reality.

While the translation is modern, in keeping with Bach's intention that his choral works be performed in the vernacular to enable audiences to understand the text, the musical instruments are not","excerpt":"all strings and woodwinds to be used in the concert are Baroque instruments, including the viola d'amore, oboe d'amore, oboe da caccia, violone, flauto traverso, viola da gamba, harpsichord, lutes and baroque violins.

Leona Helmsley, once so lofty,   reveals herself a reborn softy.   And in the corner sits a loner,   the man who's been called George the Owner.   Pardoned by a President,   Has he some new cause to repent?     The muse is fleeting, it's busy season,   thus we're losing rhyme and reason.

A Town Battles Elements, the Hard Way"},{"year":"1930","title":"THE Rue des Ursulines is an ancient street deep in that part of Paris which for a dozen centuries has been a world centre of wisdom and learning, the Latin Quarter. Only a block long, it lies on the southern slope of Mont Ste. Genevieve, one of the two high hills which dominate the city. It begins at the Rue St. Jacques, the old Roman road by which Caesar and his legions entered Paris, where later St. Louis walked barefoot bearing the Crown of Thorns, and it runs on, narrow and cobbled, for only a few hundred feet.It seems appropriate that one of the most interesting experimental theatres of the city should be in this street and should take its name from it. Appropriate also is the fact that the enterprise is not called a theatre, but a studio, Le Studio dea Ursulines. There are several such studios in Paris, directed and patronized by the \\"avant-garde\\" of the cinema world, where productions distinguished for some quality cherished by the intellectuals may be seen. Among these the \\"Ursulines\\" is an excellent example.The little street is hardly less crowded at night with limousines and taxis than the tiny theatre itself is with their occupants. The audiences are heterogeneous, composed of elegants of all nations, artists rich and poor, a smattering of good folk from the neighborhood—since prices are comparatively low-and students, in all one of the most interesting audiences to be seen anywhere.The hall itself has an odd history. Years ago it was a factory where pianos were built. Then its owner made it into an auditorium, where the people of the neighborhood celebrated their engagement parties, where schools held their commencements, where public and private dances took place. For a time a troupe of Polish marionettes performed there.Helienic Dancers.In 1911, Raymond Duncan, brother of Isadora, took over the little building and brought there his historic academy, dedicated to a Hellenic mode of life, teaching and practice. Ladies in sandals and Greek robes emerged from there, to the wonder of the Quarter, and repaired to the Luxembourg Gardens, not far away, to dance on the greensward. Sunday services of a character which in Duncan's estimation was Grecian took place, and there were public forums in the afternoon. This lasted for some nine months.Thereafter, the war came along, and a succession of unsuccessful efforts to make the Ursulines into a popular neighborhood picture house of the usual order. In 1921, as the \\"Atelier,\\" the auditorium held the Dullin Players, one of the earlier of the \\"little theatre\\" groups. In January, 1926, it became the Studio, under the direction of Armand Tallier and L. Myrga, under whose leadership it has remained ever since, highly successful.\\"We propose,\\" the two new entrepreneurs declare, \\"to recruit our public from among the élite of writers, artists and intellectuals of the Latin Quarter, and also from among that group, growing more and more numerous, whom the banality of certain screen spectacles is driving away from the usual cinema theatres. Our programs will be composed of French and foreign films of diverse tastes, tendencies and schools","excerpt":"all that represent originality, value, effort, will find place on our screen.\\"With this battle cry they plunged into exhibition. Among the two-score or so pictures they have shown several have been American, others German, British and Russian; one Japanese—the first film from Japan to be shown in Europe. They have displayed cinema work of advanced artists such as Man Ray, Cavalcanti and Picabia. They have not hesitated to present so-called \\"popular\\" pictures if the pictures had qualities which seemed interesting to them. Thus, Von Stroheim's \\"Greed\\" was shown there, and \\"Jazz,\\" by James Cruze. The picture which has been packing in the audiences for many weeks past, and which is being received as one of the most daring of cinema ventures up to this writing, is none other than \\"The River,\\" a Fox film, almost if not quite straight from Broadway.Now it is doubtful if Frank Borzage, when he composed this slightly incoherent tour de force, had any notion that it would appeal to another audience besides the general populace. It is conceivable that he gave no thought to dynamics or values or tendencies or any of the other esthetical considerations which such an audience as comes to the Ursulines would seem to demand. But he directed if not better at least differently than he knew, is would appear. He made a Roman holiday for the esthetes of Paris.A Fox Picture.As presented at the Ursulines, \\"The River\\" is vaguer than at home. There is no effort to localize the picture. A French audience is quite satisfied to consider the rather special little village perched in some Northwestern wilderness as—simply America. The dizzy swaying rope bridges of the mountain town might—as far as the avid audience here cares—be slung across the Charles near Cambridge, or the Passaic River. It simply looks to them the way America should.The fascination of the picture, so far as Paris is concerned, lies apparently in two scenes at which this sophisticated city gasps. Both of them \\"got by\\" the American censor, apparently, without question, and it is an amusing commentary on New World morals and manners to learn that here they not only carry all sorts of suggestions at which Puritans shudder but do so with a finesse which Paris admires inordinately—a finesse, no doubt, supplied by knowledge of American censorship.The first of these two episodes is that in which the ebullient and half-naked Mr. Farrell blandly swims across the pond to the rock where Mary Duncan is sitting. Those who remember the picture at home will recall the action. The second episode which enthralls this city is that in which Miss Duncan succeeds in resuscitating Mr. Farrell after he has come close to freezing.The acting of Charles Farrell pleased this community, which has a weakness for baby-talk. The curious little scene among the mountains added its improbabilities to the French idea of America, and everybody was satisfied. The picture will probably go on playing for months.\\"Harvest in U. S. A.\\"\\"The River,\\" which is called \\"La Femme au Corbeau\\" at the Ursulines, is not the only American film on view there these nights. The other is the first bit on the program, called \\"La Moisson aux Etats-Unis\\" or \\"Harvest in the United States.\\" By the evidence of the recording instruments of the reporter, this picture was even more appreciated than the feature. It showed, in simple, straightforward photography, a big reaping and threshing machine at work, presumably in the Kansas wheat fields. So thrilled were the French people just behind us that they even counted the horses and mules attached to the apparatus—thirty-two, if their count was correct! The beginning of the picture, with the giant device climbing a rise and cutting low a monstrous swath of grain was \\"formidable.\\" The wide view of a group of these huge organisms mowing down a field whose limits seemed bounded only by the horizon was \\"magnifique.\\" A close-up of the finished grain sliding in sacks down a runway to the earth behind the trundling vehicle was \\"très beau.\\" . . . Here France was discovering America, too—though not quite in the same way as through the featured picture.Two other films completed the evening's entertaining. One was a very special piece by Man Ray, called \\"The Mystery of the Château of the Dice.\\" Four individuals, wearing odd veils, played dice and swam in a picturesque château and park somewhere in France. To more advanced minds the reporter leaves the unraveling of the mystery, or perhaps of the questions, What was mysterious and why? The other short film was a microscopic study of what this land-lubber would be inclined to call a sea urchin. It is called \\"Oursin\\" in French, but the dictionary is not available. Jean Painlevé took the film obviously with great devotion. PARIS SCREEN CHATTER; Little Theatre in Old Latin Quarter Attracts Mixed Throngs Hellenic Dancers. A Fox Picture.

But violists have had only a handful of great soloists to look up to, and the instrument's last true superstar, William Primrose, died in 1982.   One violist who seems on the way to filling the role Primrose left vacant is Yuri Bashmet, a 38-year-old Soviet musician who plays with a winning combination of virtuosity and introspection. But Mr. Bashmet is not staking his future entirely on his instrument. He is also the conductor of the Moscow Soloists of the U.S.S.R., an ensemble of 20 string players. The orchestra made its New York debut on Monday evening at Carnegie Hall, with Mr. Bashmet presiding as both conductor and viola soloist.   Mr. Bashmet had programmed as his opening work Hindemith's \\"Trauermusik,\\" a work composed a day after the death of King George V of England in 1936. This gave him a ready tribute to Leonard Bernstein","excerpt":"all that was required was an insert card declaring it so, and an announcement asking the audience to withold its applause.   Mr. Bashmet played the work's viola solo with a plaintive tone, colored by only the slightest vibrato but radiating warmth. He was fully and gracefully supported by his ensemble, which recovered quickly from a haphazard opening and produced, for the most part, a silken, beautifully shaped sound.   The funereal mood was sustained in the work that followed the Hindemith, Britten's \\"Lachrymae\\" (Op. 48), a set of variations on Dowland's \\"Flow My Tears.\\" The variations range freely, and are not in the least constrained by the theme's Renaissance origin. And as in the Hindemith, Mr. Bashmet and his musicians played with a subdued but evident virtuosity.   One striking element of the ensemble's sound in both the Britten and the Hindemith was its tendency toward soft textures and pianissimo playing. At first, this quiet, refined sound kept the listener's attention drawn fully into the music. But it eventually became a distraction. Beautiful though the sound was, it demanded a smaller, more intimate hall than Carnegie.   The Hindemith and Britten were the only works in which Mr. Bashmet played his viola. In Shostakovich's Two Pieces (Op. 11) and the Tchaikovsky Serenade for Strings (Op. 48), he proved an eloquent conductor. His gestures are clear, elegant and expressive, and he knew when to leave the players on their own and when to cue them. The Shostakovich Scherzo showed the ensemble at its most energetic. And the Tchaikovsky, marked by both robust playing and the ensemble's feathery pianissimo, emerged with a lovely lilt and a near ideal blend of vibrancy and nostalgia.

(Hyperion, $22.95.) In a moving if occasionally abstract memoir -- some tales are more summarized than told -- Rita Marley reports on how she survived life with the reggae hero Bob Marley, whom she married in 1966 and ceased to speak to in 1972, after his sexual arrangements and her Rastafarianism became hard for either to bear.    THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING: The First American in Afghanistan, by Ben Macintyre. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) A British journalist pursues, over several continents, the story of Josiah Harlan (1799-1871), Pennsylvania Quaker, soldier of fortune, autodidact surgeon, counterfeiter, dope smoker, Civil War cavalry officer (Union side), Central Asian suzerain and inspiration for the tale by Kipling, who had the unenviable job of making his subject's life appear humanly possible.    EMMA BROWN: A Novel From the Unfinished Manuscript by Charlotte Brontë, by Clare Boylan. (Viking, $25.95.) A novelist steeped in Brontëana shrewdly develops the characters and ideas of two original chapters into a story of a passionate, reform-minded woman cramped by hypocrisy and convention.    THE JANE AUSTEN BOOK CLUB, by Karen Joy Fowler. (Mar-ian Wood/Putnam, $23.95.) An ambitious comic novel that is more about how to read than about book groups or Jane Austen","excerpt":"all the members have different, private Austens, and their proprietary attitudes speak to the improbability that any two readers, or any two Janes, are alike.    MISSING MEN: A Memoir, by Joyce Johnson. (Viking, $24.95.) Johnson meditates on her lifelong engagement with a missing man, her maternal grandfather, who killed himself at 37. She shows herself repeatedly seeking out partners who, like her mother, grew up without fathers, starting in her own case with Jack Kerouac; and she makes this second-generation reaction sound psychologically plausible.    THE SECRET EPIDEMIC: The Story of AIDS and Black America, by Jacob Levenson. (Pantheon, $25.) In the fall of 2000, Levenson went to the South to see why black Americans were acquiring H.I.V. at seven times the white rate; he was stopped short by a tangled web of poverty, misinformation, crack use and the insufficiency of language to convey what its users really hope to say.    NOTHING LOST, by John Gregory Dunne. (Knopf, $24.95.) This final novel by a writer who could do anything well (usually in a belligerent mode) concerns a black drifter in a Plains state, two men who killed him, a supermodel and several lawyers, all of whom seem to have secrets; few of them are still standing at the end of the day.    ALEXANDER HAMILTON, by Ron Chernow. (Penguin Press, $35.) Everyone knows how Hamilton died, but who can recall his life? (If you can't, you are encouraged to blame Jefferson and Adams, who swept their rival into the dustbin of history.)

MIND WIDE OPEN: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life, by Steven Johnson. (Scribner, $25.) A technologically oriented journalist surveys the work of scientists who study the contents of the skull, which are far more accessible than ever before, and have revealed that more things go on in the mind than even Freud supposed.

(Simon & Schuster, $25.95.) A lively, engrossing history that sees the presidential election of 1912 -- all four of its principals versus one another -- as setting up the conflict between progressive idealism and conservative values that has played itself out ever since Roosevelt, who had crowned Taft, rose in rebellion against his own party.    LITTLE BLACK BOOK OF STORIES, by A. S. Byatt. (Knopf, $21.) Five scary Gothic tales that are also meditations on art and its place in a world where the mere appearance of a horrible creature can make one woman grow up a child psychologist, another a storyteller; or where a woman is literally transformed into stone in a gritty manner that out-Ovids Ovid.    THE HAMILTON CASE, by Michelle de Kretser. (Little, Brown, $24.95.) A beguiling, multilayered novel that spans much of the 20th century, shifting its point of view several times; its primary action bears on the murder of a white man in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and the history, both family and personal, of Sam Obeysekere, an upper-class Sinhalese lawyer whose analysis of the crime is crucial but does nothing to advance his prospects.

The Senegalese hip-hop trio Daara J. has global objectives on its album ''Boomerang'' (Wrasse), which juggles singing, rapping, multiple languages and even more musical idioms. The picked strings of Senegalese traditional music, the close-harmony vocals of R&B, the backbeat of reggae, the minor chords of gangsta rap and the syncopation of a Cuban son are all at their fingertips, and even with just a few English phrases scattered through the songs, the group's consciousness-raising intent is clear.    Ryan Adams      The chameleon of roots-rock, Ryan Adams is content to leave his influences obvious. Yet behind the constant reminders of other bands, the songs are both sturdy and touching. ''Cold Roses'' (Lost Highway) -- 76 minutes of music on 2 discs, with songs full of tears and self-questioning -- leans toward Roy Orbison and the Grateful Dead. His new band and songwriting partners, the Cardinals, sound ready to take off into the flux at any moment, but they stick around to orchestrate Mr. Adams's longings.   Headphones    Moonlighting from Pedro the Lion, their usual band, the songwriter David Bazan and TW Walsh on drums concocted Headphones as songs for old synthesizers and drumbeats that are live but seem to aspire to automation. The album ''Headphones'' (Suicide Squeeze) sounds retro but somehow defenseless, as Mr. Bazan's voice wavers above the stubbornly out-of-tune synthesizers. He's right at home with paradox: ''I called to beg you not to write that stupid song,'' he confesses in ''Hot Girls,'' ''but as it happens now it's burning up the charts/and breaking hot girls' hearts as it masquerades as art.''    The Alan Lomax Archive      Alan Lomax wanted the whole word to hear the folk music he recorded, and after acquiring his archives last year, the Library of Congress has started to get them online at www.lomaxarchive.com. Past a cumbersome interface (one good route is via the index and Cultures pages) are 40-second samples of calypsos, blues, gospel, prison songs, fiddle tunes and more -- just a handful of albums now, but more are on the way. It's a shame they're not full length, and the performers' names should be more prominent, but one listen to songs from Mississippi's Parchman Farm prison or sacred-harp gospel from Alabama shows how well Lomax captured ordinary people making extraordinary music.    Aimee Mann      No wonder Aimee Mann sounds so assured in ''The Forgotten Arm'' (SuperEgo): the rhymes are exact, the melodies are perfect Beatlesesque arcs, the choruses chime right in. The album is presented as a story, but the songs are best heard separately","excerpt":"all the midtempo, piano-centered tunes run together. Mann stays on her usual turf of misplaced love and lingering addiction, and self-doubting songs like ''Going Through the Motions,'' ''She Really Wants You,'' ''Video'' and ''King of the Jailhouse'' -- with its refrain, ''Baby, there's something wrong with me that I can't see'' -- perfectly match heart and craft.    Dave Matthews Band      What the Dave Matthews Band can do in real time has been documented on 10 live albums and plenty of live-sounding studio sessions. So on ''Stand Up,'' (RCA) Mr. Matthews experiments, abetted by the R&B and hip-hop producer Mark Batson. He reduces lyrics to a minimum of words and dismantles the band's pointillistic folk-funk-Celtic-jazz propulsion. The stripped-down music is a real break from the band's old sound. Unfortunately, it's rarely an advance; metronomic rhythms and airless mixes make too many songs sound forced and sterile.    Bobby Valentino      Bobby Valentino, the latest sweet, swoopy R&B tenor aspiring to be the next Usher, doesn't just fall for a pretty face. In his hit, ''Slow Down,'' he tells the girl walking ahead of him, ''I just wanna get to know you/but don't turn around 'cause that pretty round thing looks good to me.'' His debut album, ''Disturbing Tha Peace Presents Bobby Valentino'' (DTP/Def Jam), has its own branding statement to position him in the market: ''a little thug in me, but friendly.'' His real asset is production (by Tim and Bob) that usually places something echoey and swirly in the background, a soft place to canoodle.    Celso Fonseca      The Brazilian songwriter Celso Fonseca breezes through his album, ''Rive Gauche Rio'' (Six Degrees), lacing his gently plucked bossa novas with crystalline electric piano and whiffs of electronics or simply letting his guitar and voice defy gravity. Even a pair of songs in English -- including a version of Damien Rice's ''Delicate'' with percussion moving it from Ireland to Brazil -- don't break the mood. It's no small feat to make an album so poised in its modesty.   Dave Matthews Bares Music, Aimee Mann Bears Soul"},{"year":"1973","title":"UNIONDALE, L.

A separate measure cut the deficit by $11.7 billion, partly through accounting maneuvers and the sale of Federal assets.

Real life bears little resemblance to the legend.   The article said, \\"Essentially, home rule allows local officials to govern their municipalities with little outside interference.\\" That's not the way I experienced it or hear it now from current local officials. I hear bitter complaints about the way their hands are tied by county, state and Federal regulations, not to mention union contracts, budgetary restraints, insurance regulations, debt obligations, mandated programs, etc.   Item: We patient folk in Glen Rock have been waiting a generation to have a traffic light placed at a particularly lethal intersection. Successions of councils and councilmen have all supported it, but delays come from county and state governments. Two years ago we heard it was approved, but we're still waiting.   Item: In Wyckoff, a 60-foot bridge filling a culvert on a main thoroughfare was closed for repairs for nine months. Again, the explanation for the delay and inconvenience was complying with county and state requirements. A century ago, the Brooklyn Bridge took only three times as long to build.   Some quantification of the degree of home rule can be determined by examining local budgets. The last time I looked at our local school board budget, less than 3 percent was earmarked for discretionary spending","excerpt":"all the rest was mandated. This can be interpreted as the ratio of home rule to total governance, less than 3 percent.   Not unexpectedly, some local officials wax religious extolling the virtues of home rule, because home rule protects their turf. But stroking their egos gets very expensive for us taxpayers.   I would be very happy to sacrifice some of our local political turf if, for instance, the 13 towns in northwest Bergen County had one school district, because we could save significant dollars. (California, with 13 times the population of New Jersey, has one-third the number of school districts.)   Such a move would deprive the teachers' union of its very effective tactic of playing the districts against one another at bargaining sessions. There is no good reason for teachers in Waldwick, Mahwah and Franklin Lakes to have contracts different from one another or from those in Glen Rock, Ridgewood or Midland Park, or for that matter Morristown or Cape May.   William Flynn may have been right when he said in the article, \\"Maybe the towns will all get together and choose the contract with the highest salaries and the best benefits,\\" but I wouldn't bet on it. At least not with the tax rebellion going on now.   Prof. George Sternlieb was probably correct when he said that \\"people want the ability to walk down to City Hall and holler, and they're going to be kind of upset if someone takes that ability away from them.\\"   Not for nothing has \\"fighting City Hall\\" become the embodiment of fruitlessness. It is not a unique experience to go to City Hall with a complaint and be told, \\"Gee, I'd love to help you, but let me read you the state regulations.\\"   I think most of us would choose to relinquish a valueless folk tale to save some real tax dollars.

Let us set the record straight: the work ethic is not a \\"traditional value.\\" It is a johnny-come-lately value, along with thin thighs and nonsmoking hotel rooms. In ancient times, work was considered a disgrace inflicted on those who had failed to amass a nest egg through imperial conquest or other forms of organized looting. . . .    The work ethic came along a couple of millennia later, in the form of Puritanism -- the idea that the amount of self-denial you endured in this life was a good measure of the amount of fun awaiting you in the next. But the work ethic only got off the ground with the Industrial Revolution and the arrival of the factory system. . . . There followed riots, revolutions, graffiti. Quickly, the word went out from the robber barons to the swelling middle class of lawyers, financial consultants, plant managers, and other forerunners of the yuppie: Look busy! Don't go home until the proles have punched out! Make 'em think    we're    doing the work and that they're lucky to be able to hang around and help out! An Earthly Paradise of Insects      J. Henri Fabre (1823-1915) was the first entomologist to stress studying insects in nature, buying a decrepit farm for his research. He describes his natural laboratory in this excerpt from \\"The Insect World of J. Henri Fabre,\\" translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos (Beacon, paper).      This cursed ground, which no one would have had at a gift to sow with a pinch of turnip-seed, is an earthly paradise for the Bees and Wasps. Its mighty growth of thistles and centauries draws them all to me from everywhere around. Never, in my insect-hunting memories, have I seen so large a population at a single spot","excerpt":"all the trades have made it their rallying-point. Here come hunters of every kind of game, builders in clay, weavers of cotton goods, collectors of pieces cut from a leaf or the petals of a flower, architects in pasteboard, plasterers mixing mortar, carpenters boring wood, miners digging underground galleries, workers handling goldbeater's skin and many more. The Tree at the Center of the Earth      Survival is often a matter of ingenuity. Ronald Wright explains how the Maya of Central America grafted their own beliefs onto those forced on them by their conquerors, in \\"Time Among the Maya: Travels in Belize, Guatemala, and Mexico\\" (Owl/ Holt, paper).      D. H. Lawrence saw the New World civilizations as a forest of great trees felled by the white invader, but he believed the roots were still alive, sending up shoots through the foreign soil deposited above them. It was a metaphor the Maya would recognize. They saw, and see, themselves as part of a great    ceiba   , a silk-cotton tree that stands at the center of the earth, supports the heavens, and symbolizes life itself. On the walls of Classic temples at Palenque, built eight centuries before Columbus, the world-tree was represented as a leafy cross. After the conquest, the Maya took easily to the Christian cross, grafting it onto those ancient roots, converting it from a dead god's scaffold to a living archetype. In the vertical plane the tree's roots, bole, and foliage represent underworld, world, and heaven; seen horizontally, the cross is \\"the eye of God,\\" axis of the world's four directions. The Mocking Spirit of the New      Emmet Kennedy argues that the French Revolution signaled the moment when an agnostic urban culture successfully challenged the tenets of rural, traditional society. This is from \\"A Cultural History of the French Revolution\\" (Yale University, paper).      In Paris censorship and society were at odds; in the village they were intimately bound. In Paris the conflict between    gens de lettres    and the civil and ecclesiastical authorities destroyed old values and generated new ones; the repudiation of institutional sanctions led to upheaval and the formation of a new society. By contrast, authority    was    the village, not something erected over and against it, which helps explain the villages' perpetuation of traditions. . . . Deferential, reverential toward superiors and ancient beliefs, village life was the antithesis of the mocking spirit of Paris. Habit regulated it. Customs were honored even when harmful. Life consisted in repeating the same chores, the same festivals, the same loves, the same hates, the same stories listened to and learned by heart. Elsewhere's Siren Call      Andrei Codrescu explains why writers in general and poets in particular have found the idea of exile so appealing. This is from \\"The Disappearance of the Outside: A Manifesto for Escape\\" (Addison-Wesley, paper).      Twentieth-century poets, with Homer, Dante, and the    trovadors    in back of them, have viewed exile therapeutically. Freedom of the spirit was available only by leaving home. They answered the siren call of the Elsewhere for many reasons, but mainly because they were not able to breathe at home. The deep breath is the breath of travel, of speed, of horseback, of movement. The individual \\"I\\" had to explode its well-defined limits. . . . The mind is a rapacious beast whose appetites outgrow geography. Freedom is a greedy appetite of the mind, and both \\"time\\" and \\"geography\\" conspire against it, undernourish and frustrate it. This hunger is at the core of poetic exile. . . .   Freed of the tribe's conventions, the poet is free to express the critical dictates of his instant nomad passage. A history by \\"flash\\" flares in his wake. In the wealth of new selves available to him in a new place, he can choose to be historical or he can disappear entirely.

Two Voices Born From Gospel In Search of Soul"},{"year":"1990","title":"In the 1960's, Southern soul music merged gospel and blues and turned them into rock. In hindsight, the style seems as natural and hardy as granite, with its chugging beat, terse riffs and voices poised between pain and exultation. Although Southern soul has been commercially eclipsed, the oldies are still current on television soundtracks and commercials. The style also continues on a few independent labels, in gospel music and among revivalists like Michael Bolton (who shows how hard it is to re-create the style's apparent spontaneity). Two 1990 albums, Robert Cray's \\"Midnight Stroll\\" (Mercury/PolyGram 846 652","excerpt":"all three formats) and Etta James's \\"Stickin' to My Guns\\" (Island 842 926; all three formats), can stand alongside the best of 1960's soul.   On previous albums, Mr. Cray sounded like an uncommonly gifted revivalist; with \\"Midnight Stroll\\" he has become a soul singer who makes every bent note and wordless moan ring with emotion. The songs, most of them written by Mr. Cray and his band members, are a loose cycle about a couple on the verge of breaking up, all tension and remorse; while the songs are less psychologically complex than the ones on Mr. Cray's 1986 \\"Strong Persuader,\\" the music's new authority makes them resonant. On \\"Midnight Stroll,\\" as before, Mr. Cray's band is bolstered by the Memphis Horns, who played on 1960's Stax/Volt soul hits, but the music now has a classic restraint and gravity, from the riffs to Mr. Cray's sinuous, sighing lead guitar. Above the band, his supple tenor voice conveys suffering and hope, and on \\"These Things\\" he finally breaks loose with the howls and shouts he has been holding back for years.   Etta James started performing in the 1950's, but her heart and voice are at home in 1960's soul. \\"Stickin' to My Guns\\" is the best album Aretha Franklin never made, as Ms. James belts out songs about lovers and deceivers. Where \\"Seven Year Itch,\\" her last album, worked too hard to punch out its riffs, \\"Stickin' to My Guns\\" is comfortable and assured. Ms. James sings in a voice that has seen everything and is ready for more; it's girlish and clear one moment, rasping with lusty assertiveness the next, and powerful enough to make even an Otis Redding ballad sound as if it were made for her. Ms. James knows it's 1990 - \\"Get Funky\\" has a guest rapper - but for her and Mr. Cray, it's as if Southern soul never faltered. The 60's Very Soul"},{"year":"1991","title":"Linda and Cecil Womack probably don't think of themselves as pillars of the outsider-pop community. But that's what they are after seven years of crafting extraordinary love songs with singular grooves. Womack and Womack seem to be a lingering example of the venerable soul-couple tradition that stretches from the adolescent fantasies of Shirley and Lee to the suave sparring of Ashford and Simpson. Yet as the Womacks' new \\"Family Spirit\\" (RCA 3072-2-R","excerpt":"all three formats) confirms, they're not a retrograde act.    The rhetoric, tone and structure of their tunes show generous touches of elemental blues and gospel without trying to recreate the sound of Stax, Motown or Philly Soul. In an era when pop musicians define themselves by rhythm, Womack and Womack's commitment to vivid pulse in every track is quite contemporary, but their spare, sinuous beats owe little to hip-hop or disco. The Womacks' New 'Family Spirit'"},{"year":"1991","title":"Nirvana's Vertiginous ascent to stardom has to be the year's most surprising success story.

What is strange about Nirvana's popularity is that both single and album are untamed punk rock -- slightly more glossily produced and tuneful than the hard-core norm but bearing no discernible signs of compromise.   It's not so much the album's glossy grunge that's made it such a success, however, but the raw, raging fashion with which Nirvana articulates its feelings of impotence, bewilderment and inertia. Like other classic punk albums -- the Stooges' \\"Funhouse,\\" the Sex Pistols' \\"Never Mind the Bollocks,\\" Black Flag's \\"Damaged\\" -- it captures the particular desperation of its day, while having a handle on the perennial teen-age obsessions with boredom, claustrophobia and sex.

Dawn, \\"Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience\\" (Gee Street/Island Records 314-510276","excerpt":"all three formats) is by turns a hip-hop head trip, a valentine to fans of pop Romanticism and a cleverly executed blow to the macho brigade of current rappers. Blending an assortment of borrowed beats, samples and unabashedly sweet harmonies, the record \\"welcomes you to the Utopian experience,\\" as the rapper and vocalist Prince Be announces early on, concocting the headiest brew of pop-rap reshuffling to date.\\n\\nP. M. Dawn consists of Prince Be, who writes most of the lyrics, and D. J. Minutemix. The duo's No. 1 pop single, \\"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\\" -- built on a casually strummed guitar hook from Spandau Ballet's \\"True\\" -- links Spandau's high-pop sheen to Prince Be's Sam Cooke quotation (\\"You send me\\") and transforms a secular tale of teen-age love into a prayerful ode.

Rap moves faster. \\"De La Soul Is Dead\\" (Tommy Boy 1029","excerpt":"all three formats) is only De La Soul's second album, but the group already gripes about the annoyances of being recognized and the onslaught of people proffering their demo tapes. Where De La Soul's debut, \\"Three Feet High and Rising,\\" offered an amiable, good-humored but socially aware alternative to every rap orthodoxy of 1989, most of \\"De La Soul Is Dead\\" is defensive and parochial. Now, the band is protecting its turf.    De La Soul was the first to record among the self-described \\"tribe\\" of rappers called Native Tongue; soon to follow were the Jungle Brothers and A Tribe Called Quest. Mase, Posdnuos and Trugoy the Dove of De La Soul rapped in a slow, offhanded style as their producer, Prince Paul, manipulated snippets for a backup that was lean and unafraid to be dinky. While the delivery was casual and the rappers' Day-Glo wardrobe and peace-sign logo gave De La Soul a blithe hippie image, the songs covered a lot of ground, from a teen-ager's sexual initiation (\\"Jenifa Taught Me\\") to drugs (\\"Say No Go\\") to inner-city despair (\\"Ghetto Thang\\"); the boasts and come-ons had a sly humor. De La Soul's innovations paid off; their relaxed tone attracted collegiate and suburban fans who were deterred by more confrontational rappers. \\"Three Feet High and Rising\\" became one of the best-selling independent-label releases of 1989.

Its off-center beat has high name recognition among casual music fans and pervades commercials for fruit juice and tropical vacations. But reggae has a vitality problem: its revered past and sluggish present threaten to stifle its future.    Despite the outstanding, previously unreleased live performances on Bob Marley and the Wailers' recent \\"Talking Blues,\\" the album points up the threat from the past.  Marley's ghost seems to be the only reggae figure the mainstream considers worthy of attention. For the most part, current trends from Jamaica do not offer fierce competition. The popular dance-hall style, with its nimble electronic shimmy and groove-seeking arrangements, is potentially the reggae equivalent of hip-hop but in practice much more reactionary. Even with the resourceful producer Winston (Niney) Holness stretching beats, an anthology of contemporary reggae like \\"Turbo Charge\\" (Heartbeat CD HB 85","excerpt":"all three formats) settles for the same honorable, if shopworn, party pleasures as an old \\"Shindig\\" collection.

The rhythm section bludgeons the beat; guitar riffs bulldoze forward implacably as James Hetfield howls and rasps. His lyrics agonize over death, war, lycanthropy and lost religion. For most rock or pop bands, the style and message would be unimaginably desolate. But Metallica is going to have to convince its fans that, on its fifth full-length album, it hasn't sold out.    Metallica has been the standard-bearer for speed metal, a style born in the 1980's out of 1970's punk rock, hard rock and heavy metal. Speed metal ignored the party-hearty fantasies of most heavy metal to take up more apocalyptic subjects like coercion and insanity; not for nothing is Metallica's publishing company called Creeping Death Music. Yet there was an audience hungry to hear grim tidings. Metallica's first albums sold hundreds of thousands of copies with hardly any radio exposure. Its double album, \\". . . And Justice for All,\\" released in '88, sold more than two million copies, boosted by all-metal radio stations, the band's first more-or-less ballad and a video of \\"One\\" -- a song about a blind quadriplegic soldier wishing for death.

In its early years, Soul Asylum was part of Minneapolis's indelible post-punk rock scene, which also included the Replacements and Husker Du. The three bands  shared a fondness for smart lyrics, well-turned melodies and raucous guitars; before grunge came along, they were linking pop catchiness to a punk attack. (Grunge would add a crucial ingredient for mass appeal: a heavy-metal edge.)

It's a wise choice, wiser than the one Aretha Franklin makes on her new \\"What You See Is What You Sweat\\" (Arista 8628; all three formats). Any pop performer whose career stretches into the decades, like Mr. Brown or Ms. Franklin, sooner or later has to decide whether to continually update the music -- to try and keep up with the market -- or to follow private instincts and see whether the public pays attention. In trying to stay contemporary, Ms. Franklin, one of America's greatest singers, has landed in a limbo somewhere between Whitney Houston and Patti Labelle. And while \\"Love Overdue\\" won't eclipse Mr. Brown's finest music of the 1960's and 1970's, its better songs prove he can still summon his old vitality.

The Neville Brothers - Art, 51, Charles, 50, Aaron, 48, and Cyril, 41 - are part of New Orleans's most important postwar pop musical dynasty, a family steeped in both the Mardi Gras culture of the city, as well as its pop music-making side, which at best has had an off-and-on-again flirtation with the American music business.

Smith, it evolved into one of the most critically acclaimed and influential groups of the post-punk era. In the mid-80's, the Fall was the prototype for the abrasive British genre of \\"shambling bands.\\" More recently, its coruscating sound and cryptic lyrics have been a major influence on the \\"indie\\" scene in the United States. Pavement, the most prominent band in the burgeoning American lo-fi underground, is indebted to the Fall, as are other up-and-coming groups like Truman's Water, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 and God Is My Co-Pilot.   The Fall has signed with the hip independent label Matador, and the band's new album is its first for some while to be widely distributed in the United States. \\"The Infotainment Scan\\" (Matador/Atlantic 92263","excerpt":"all three formats), the Fall's 16th studio album, is one of the group's most accessible, so it may be that the band will reach a whole new audience, primed by Pavement, et al.

Settle into a song and, the moment it's over, the band blasts it away with anything from jittering synthesizers to pummeling drums and feedback to a belting opera singer. Most of the tunes ride terse, catchy riffs, but blaring guitars drive one song, cool keyboards the next, mechanical sequencers a third. Cathal Coughlan, the band's songwriter and singer, can croon with an open-throated Irish baritone, but he also cramps his tone with a bullhorn or distorts it into a sour growl. Even within songs there's friction; \\"Angel's Delight,\\" a kind of lullaby that opens the album, croons, \\"Kill a cop.\\"    The jolts fit the Fatima Mansions' world view. In Mr. Coughlan's hallucinatory lyrics, civilization has turned into a nightmare of poverty, fear, endless strife and what the triumphal-sounding \\"You're a Rose,\\" which is something like a love song, calls \\"squalid, mute despair.\\" The spooky \\"Look What I Stole for Us, Darling\\" starts at a whisper above breathy, subdued funk and dissonant noises, then moves to hard, synthesizer-driven rock as it describes a purely joyless existence: \\"I must be brutal or die.\\" Irish Rockers With a Rebel's Cause"},{"year":"1990","title":"LEAD: In ''50-50 Chance,'' the most compelling song on Suzanne Vega's third album, ''Days of Open Hand'' (A & M 7502","excerpt":"all three formats), the narrator pays a hospital visit to a woman who is near death.

He'll share a racy joke, grumble about the state of the world, make faces at solemn moments, gripe and snicker at signs that he's not getting any younger. For their second album, \\"Vol. 3\\" (Warner Brothers 26324","excerpt":"all three formats), the Traveling Wilburys have forged a collective persona a lot like that uncle. From the youngest Wilbury, 37-year-old Tom Petty, to the oldest, 49-year-old Bob Dylan, they're ready to lead rock into an unseemly middle age. \\"Wilbury Twist\\" is probably the first would-be dance craze to instruct \\"Fall on your ass/ Get back up/ Put your teeth in a glass.\\"    The Wilburys appeared in 1988, when Mr. Dylan, Mr. Petty, the ex-Beatle George Harrison, Jeff Lynne from the Electric Light Orchestra and the rockabilly tenor Roy Orbison made \\"Volume One.\\" Their names didn't appear on the album, but their faces and unmistakable voices did; so did sly allusions to their own past songs. More than most all-star efforts, the Wilburys amalgamated a style with traces of all their contributions: Mr. Dylan's pithy, picaresque verbal style, Mr. Harrison's and Mr. Petty's rock tunes with pop twists, Mr. Lynne's vocal chorales, Mr. Harrison's legato lead guitar and pumping saxophones. Floating free of the other Wilburys' nasal lead vocals, Orbison's yearning tenor would declare things like, \\"I'm so tired of being lonely.\\" The songs juggled darkly sardonic tall tales with reassurance and the possibility of love.

He has been talking tough since he first appeared with N.W.A., the Compton, Calif., group that put gangster rap on the charts with its foul-mouthed tales of gunslinging, sex, dope-dealing and hatred for the police. After he left N.W.A. in late 1989, the group turned into a pandering self-parody while Ice Cube took on a veneer of political consciousness for his first solo album, the million-selling \\"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted.\\" Produced by Chuck D. of Public Enemy, the album presented Ice Cube's tales of ghetto violence as front-line reports on the status of the young black male as an \\"endangered species.\\"   With his role in the recent film \\"Boyz N the Hood\\" as a brooding, reluctant gang member, and an elegy for victims of violence called \\"Dead Homiez\\" released as a single between albums, Ice Cube (whose real name is O'Shea Jackson) seemed to be recanting the outlaw persona he had created for himself.

He can barely choke them out. He gets across a word or two, just a syllable sometimes, before he gulps for breath; when he tries again, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth. While he gasps out those broken phrases, machine-made music pounds and crackles around him, at times nearly drowning him out. The sampled sounds are unyielding, the beat relentless, claustrophobic. Give him a treacly sentiment about brotherhood or self-esteem, and his voice turns smooth and sure on a posh cushion of supportive music. But the love songs sound like they're being extracted under torture.    Twisted as it seems, \\"Dangerous\\" only reinforces Jackson's place as the most paradoxical superstar in pop history. After making the best-selling album to date, \\"Thriller\\" (1982), he works to secure vast popularity, with his face promoted around the world, while he guards a reclusive privacy. He is a great dancer, yet his songs proclaim a terror of the body and of fleshly pleasures; the title track of \\"Dangerous\\" is only his latest song about a predatory lover: \\"I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity,\\" he recites.

Though opponents fear further indebtedness by state authorities, the authority is one of the state's most effective levers for economic growth.

A constitutional amendment is required to authorize a swap of locally owned land for 50 acres of forest preserve that will enable local authorities to clear land around the runway. The impact on the forest would be negligible; the additional safety factor is extremely significant. Vote \\"yes.\\"     Proposal Three    would authorize new development along the Erie Canal, which crosses the state, connecting the Hudson River with the Great Lakes. This early 19th-century development was instrumental in opening the Midwest to settlement. It has become a lively tourist attraction; to expand that role, a constitutional change is required to permit leasing and development of adjacent areas. Tolls would also be authorized.

Central champion)  Season series: Yankees 6, Indians 5    PITCHING  Everything revolves around David Cone's shoulder being healthy. It Cone stumbles, the Yankees could follow. Andy Pettitte has been their best starter, and the battle for the Game 3 start between David Wells and Dwight Gooden motivated both to snazzier results. In the bullpen, Mariano Riveria insists his weary arm is fine, but even a minor problem is scary. Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton have to get the most pivotal outs of the series. The Yankees lead the league with 3.84 e.r.a., but the relievers match what they did in the 1996 division series against Texas, when they permitted only one earned run in 212/3 innings?    The hitters' production overshadowed the top-flight work of the pitchers the previous two seasons, but the Indians knew the real strength of their club. The pitching staff had the league's lowest earned run average each of those two season, but this season the pitchers finished with a 4.73 e.r.a., ninth in the league and nearly a full run higher than the Yankees' league-leading 3.84. The tipoff on the Indians' pitching plight is that Jaret Wright, a rookie who has never pitched against the Yankees, has been named to start Game 2, ahead of Charles Nagy, who had an 18.00 e.r.a. against New York.    HITTING  Tim Raines, Wade Boggs and Cecil Fielder are peaking, Tino Martinez, Paul O'Neill and Bernie Williams have been powerful all season and Derek Jeter, Joe Girardi, Chad Curtis and Rey Sanchez are no pushovers. The Yankees scored more runs than every team except Seattle and Colorado, so they should be feared. But they also topped the league in stranding runners, a nasty habit. They must continue to do the basic things, too, a Joe Torre trademark as they paced the league in walks, on-base percentage and sacrifice flies.    Matt Williams, the replacement for Albert Belle, needed time to get going, but go he eventually did, finishing with a team-leading 105 runs batted in and 32 home runs, including 5 against the Yankees. He joins Jim Thome (40, 102) and another newcomer, David Justice (33, 101), in giving the Indians a formidable power trio. Sandy Alomar Jr. (career highs .324, 21, 83) had a super season, and Manny Ramirez (.328, 26, 88) contributed his typically good performance. Marquis Grissom, yet another newcomer, was the team's top hitter against the Yankees with a .436 average.    FIELDING  The only suspect defensive player would be Raines in left, which is why Torre is starting Curtis at the expansive Yankee Stadium. Boggs has lost range at third, but he is not a detriment. Charlie Hayes will be an upgrade when he starts. If Girardi's fractured left middle fingertip gets any worse, it will be a serious problem. Jeter, Sanchez and Williams are reliable up the middle. The Yankees made 104 errors, but usually do not hurt themselves when their gloves are on.    Third baseman Williams and shortstop Omar Vizquel form a solid left side of the infield, committing only 22 errors between them. Grissom, who replaced Kenny Lofton in center field, is less spectacular than Lofton, but, as his predecessor did, roams wide and deep.    MANAGER  Torre did a superior job keeping the distractions from being too distracting, but he must duplicate his remarkable post-season maneuvering. Everything Torre did during the 1996 post-season made him look like King Midas. From picking Graeme Lloyd for the roster and then exploiting him, to his other nifty relief choices, to starting Fielder over Martinez in the World Series, everything worked. Torre will be challenged to repeat this golden touch and notch the 11 triumphs necessary for another title.    Mike Hargrove, in his seventh season, appeared to be out on a limb earlier in the year when the Indians, noted for tying up their good players with long-term contracts, did not immediately extend one to him. They eventually did, and Hargrove steered the Indians to their third consecutive division championship. This was probably the most difficult of the three seasons because of the major changes the team underwent.    STYLE  This is a confident team that rolls into the post-season after winning 17 of the last 22. This is a motivated team that feels overlooked after winning 96 games. This is a team that is formidable enough to win another World Series and flawed enough to loss in the first round. It will be interesting to watch, win or lose.    Using a combination of power and speed, the Indians don't allow the opposition to shut them down by stymieing one part of their offense. Vizquel and Grissom are the prime basestealers and were joined a month ago by Bip Roberts, acquired to be the leadoff hitter.

East champion) vs. SEATTLE (90-72, A.L. West champion)      Season series: Orioles 7, Mariners 4      Don't tell the Orioles Randy Johnson is unbeatable. They are responsible for half of the 20-game winner's four losses this season and won the third game he started as well, hitting four home runs in 19 innings against him. They also held Ken Griffey Jr. to a .234 batting average and struck him out 11 times while he was hitting three home runs.    But this is the post-season, and Johnson, Jamie Moyer and Jeff Fassero could make life difficult for a team that has had difficulty scoring runs. Griffey, too, could be hard to stop for a pitching staff that has struggled in recent weeks. The bullpens could hold the key. What had been a strong Baltimore relief corps has turned ineffective recently, and the Mariners' crew has improved over a performance that had been dreadful for most of the season.    NATIONAL LEAGUE    SAN FRANCISCO (90-72, N.L. West champions) vs. FLORIDA (92-70, wild card)      Season series: Giants 6, Marlins 5      This series may seem to be a matchup between a team that is a division champion for the first time since 1989 and an expansion team in the playoffs in its fifth season. But it's really about old friends from Pittsburgh, who when they were together never could quite get to the World Series.    Barry Bonds on one side (Giants), Bobby Bonilla and Jim Leyland on the other (Marlins). The failure of Bonds to produce in the post-season (.191 in three appearances) was a major reason why Leyland wasn't able to take the Pirates farther. Bonilla had 1 hit in 20 at-bats for Baltimore last season. Neither has even a league championship series guarantee, but at least one will get there. The Marlins have better pitching; the Giants are more explosive offensively.     ATLANTA (101-61, N.L. East champions) vs. HOUSTON (84-78, N.L. Central champions)      Season series: Braves 7, Astros 4      The Braves' starting pitching rotation is the best in the business, but it won't scare the Astros easily. They beat Greg Maddux once and John Smoltz twice and hit Denny Neagle pretty well. Tom Glavine is the only one of the Formidable Four who stifled them (3-0, 1.33 e.r.a.). But the Braves did not have baseball's best record by accident.    If the Astros, who reached the post-season with one of the weakest championship records ever, have any hope against the defending N.L. champs, it's that the Braves don't always score enough runs even for their pitchers. The Braves outscored the Astros by only 40-36 this season.

(5-6) This is a chance for Miami, with a new coach (Butch Davis), a new offense (two backs, not one) and 12 new starters, to prove it is the powerhouse of old. It should have its hands full with U.C.L.A., which has 17 returning starters. One is a 1,000-yard running back with the intriguing name of Karim Abdul-Jabbar, no relation to the old Bruin basketball hero. Syracuse (7-4) at North Carolina (8-4) A year ago, after a 6-1 start, Syracuse plunged to 7-4 and did not get a bowl bid. Now it has good but inexperienced talent. Its quarterbacks are Keith Downing, a sophomore in for eight plays last year, and Donovan McNabb and Kevin Johnson, both redshirt freshmen. The starter will be announced at game time. Whoever it is, he will find that North Carolina will be tough at home. Michigan (9-4, 1-0) at Illinois (7-5)   With a new coach in Lloyd Carr and a final-play victory over Virginia in last Saturday's Pigskin Clasic, Michigan may not scare Big Ten rivals. Illinois could make it difficult. Its linebacker, Simeon Rice, may be the best player in college football. Colorado (11-1) at Wisconsin (7-4-1) Colorado is another lion of old that could be slipping. It has lost Coach Bill McCartney, tailback Rashaan Salaam, quarterback Kordell Stewart and wide receiver Michael Westbrook. The new quartrback is Koy Detmer, a younger brother of the former Brigham Young quarterback, Ty Detmer. OTHER GAMES EAST Purdue (7-6) at West Virginia (4-5-2) West Virginia could be Miami's major threat in the Big East. Its offense has nine returning starters, including Chad Johnston, a smart quarterback. Purdue's veteran team seems outmanned here. Washington State (8-4) at Pittsburgh (3-8) Washington State, a second-tier power last year, must replace nine defensive starters, but it should handle Pitt. The Panthers have a workhorse tailback in Billy West, but little offensive depth, and the schedule is rough. MIDWEST Temple (2-9) at Kansas State (9-3) Kansas State may be headed for another big year because eight defensive starters and the best receivers are back. Matt Miller succeeds Chad May at quarterback. Temple will have trouble surviving its first three games -- against Kansas State, West Virginia and Penn State, all on the road. Cincinnati (2-8-1) at Kansas (6-5) Kansas in a runaway. The Jayhawks rushed for 247 yards a game last year, and L.T. Levine and June Henley, the key runners, are back. A new 3-4 may solve their defensive problems. SOUTH Florida State (10-1-1) vs. Duke (8-4) at Orlando, Fla. A year ago, Duke was 7-0 until a 59-20 beating at Florida State. This week, Coach Fred Goldsmith of Duke told his coaching staff, \\"Prepare to win the game. Don't prepare to look good losing.\\" Still, Duke may struggle to stay within four touchdowns of Florida State, whose shotgun offense has helped make it the national preseason favorite. Mississippi (4-7) at Auburn (9-1-1) Auburn, again an elite team, returns eight offensive starters, including running back Stephen Davis and all five interior linemen. Mississippi has a good offense and a questionable defense. Social note: Auburn is coming off probation and Mississippi is going on. East Carolina (7-5) at Tennessee (8-4) East Carolina has 18 returning starters, Tennessee 15. Tennessee is in a higher league, especially with its poised sophomore quarterback, Peyton Manning, Archie's son. Alabama (12-1) at Vanderbilt (5-6) Alabama has won 12 straight at Vanderbilt and should win comfortably again, even though it must replace quarterback Jay Barker and tailback Sherman Williams. Rod Dowhower, Vanderbilt's new coach, will have Ronnie Gordon pass more. William and Mary (8-3) at Virginia (9-3, 0-1)  William and Mary is a sacrificial lamb from Division I-AA. Virginia, which had Michigan beaten last week until the final play, may be the best team in the Atlantic Coast Conference except for Florida State. Louisville (6-5) at Kentucky (1-10) Howard Schnellenberger left Louisville for Oklahoma, but the new coach, Ron Cooper, inherits a talented team. Kentucky's new one-back offense has the back it needs in Moe Williams, but who will block for him? SOUTHWEST Louisiana State (4-7) at Texas A&M (10-0-1) In the last year of the 81-year-old Southwest Conference, the Aggies are off probation and should contend for the national title. Leeland McElroy may be the best running back anywhere. Louisiana State's new coach, Gerry DiNardo, has 17 returning starters and a decent offense. Arkansas (4-7) at Southern Methodist (1-9-1) While Arkansas is hardly a power, it does have 18 starters back, 10 on defense. Southern Methodist is improved. It should be because its pass defense last year was awful. FAR WEST Texas (8-4) x 18 at Hawaii (3-8-1) Texas has worked hard to upgrade its rushing defense. It had so many injuries last year that it had to use 13 linebackers. Still, this should not be a tough game because Hawaii is usually an accommodating host. Arizona State (3-8) at Washington (7-4) Washington, finally off probation, may be back in the Rose Bowl picture if it can overcome offensive problems. It will try to solve one of them by passing from the shotgun. Its defense is solid. Oregon (9-4) at Utah (10-2) With Coach Rich Brooks and quarterback Danny O'Neil gone, Oregon may come down to earth after its near-dream season. It still has a veteran team, and Utah is not the power it was last year. MISMATCHES Houston (1-10) at Florida (10-2-1) Florida graduated three defensive linemen to the pros. If it can fill the gaps there, it will be a national contender again. Quarterback Danny Wuerffel is one of the best. Florida should win by seven touchdowns. Northwestern (3-7-1) at Notre Dame (6-5-1) Coach Lou Holtz is on the hot seat because 6-5-1 seasons leave Notre Dame aghast. He has weapons in quarterback Ron Powlus and tailback Randy Kinder. Northwestern has speed, but it is small and the defense is thin. Notre Dame by five touchdowns. Pacific (6-5) at Arizona (8-4) A year ago, Arizona expected roses and got thorns. It has an experienced quarterback in Dan White and its usual tough defense. While it may be looking ahead to Southern California three weeks hence, it should win here by five touchdowns. 1994 and 1995 records in parentheses","excerpt":"All times Eastern COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT"},{"year":"1995","title":"KEY GAMES OF TOP TEAMS  No. 1 Florida (5-0) at No. 16 Auburn (4-1)  In drubbing Mississippi State, Auburn got 274 yards passing from Patrick Nix and 162 rushing from Stephen Davis. It has upset Florida the last two years, but Florida should have too much now.  No. 2 Ohio State (5-0) at No. 17 Wisconsin (2-1-1)  Another big test for Ohio State, which faces one almost evey week. Last Saturday, the Buckeyes upset Penn State on Bobby Hoying's passing (24 of 35 for 354 yards), Eddie George's rushing (105 yards) and big plays.  No. 4 Northwestern (4-1) at No. 19 Minnesota (3-1)  For 23 years, Northwestern has averaged two victories a season. This year, it has beaten Notre Dame and Michigan. As Coach Gary Barnett said after the upset of Michigan, \\"I dream of those things, but it's hard to pull them off.\\"  No. 10 Tennessee (5-1) vs. No. 20 Alabama (4-1) at Birmingham, Ala.  Peyton Manning should be the difference. In beating Arkansas, Tennessee's sophomore quarterback completed 35 of 46 passes for 384 yards and 4 touchdowns.  EAST  No. 11 Notre Dame (4-2) vs. Army (1-2-1) at East Rutherford, N.J.  The Irish needed three big plays in the last three minutes to beat Washington. This should be easier, even with its two best tailbacks injured.  Eastern Michigan (4-1) at No. 21 Syracuse (4-1)  Although Syracuse's injured tailback, Malcolm Thomas, will not play, the Orangemen will be the toughest foe of the season for Eastern Michigan. This looks like a blowout.  West Virginia (2-3) at Boston College (2-3)  Boston College plays a tougher schedule than its Big East rival and moves the ball better (199 yards rushing against Pitt). It held Pitt to minus 11 yards rushing.  Lafayette (1-3-1) at Princeton (4-0)  Princeton can run the ball (132 yards a game for Mark Washington alone) and stop the run, allowing only 100.3 rushing yards a game.  Lehigh (3-2) at Columbia (2-1-1)  Columbia upset Penn with an opportunistic defense. Now it must stop the passing of Bob Aylsworth (21 of 31 for 291 yards in beating Bucknell).  Dartmouth (2-2) at Yale (2-2)  Dartmouth's defense is fine, and it can win unless its shaky offense keeps turning the red zone into a dread zone.  MIDWEST  Indiana (2-3) at No. 6 Iowa (4-0)  Iowa should win, especially since Indiana's quarterback, Chris Dittoe, is out for two weeks with an injured knee.  Penn State (3-2) at Purdue (2-2-1)  This could be easy for Penn State, but the Nittany Lions are not the smooth powerhouse of last year.  Iowa State (2-3) at No. 8 Kansas (5-0)  Kansas by a ton. After Mark Williams had passed for 299 yards in a 40-24 upset of Colorado, he said, \\"We knew we would win, so it wasn't an upset.\\"  SOUTH  No. 18 North Carolina (3-2) at Georgia Tech (3-2)  Is Carolina really better than Virginia, its upset victim last week? Probably not. It should get tested here.  Penn (3-1) at William & Mary (4-2)  The Quakers's 24-game winning streak is over, and they face a buzzsaw in a stronger Division I-AA foe.  Rutgers (1-3) at Miami (1-3)  Two big disappointments in the Big East, but Miami has better prospects short range and long range.  SOUTHWEST  Texas (4-1) vs. No. 22 Oklahoma (4-1) at Dallas  As usual, a nice matchup, with the edge to Oklahoma. Texas gave up 428 yards to a poor Rice team.  No. 12 Kansas State (5-0) at Oklahoma State (1-4)  Although Kansas State has been playing patsies, it has three straight shutouts and has allowed only six possessions inside its 20 yard line.  FAR WEST  Washington (3-2) at No. 15 Stanford (4-0-1)  Stanford, a prospective doormat in the Pacific 10, is off to its best start since 9-0 in 1951. This should be a real test.  Washington State (3-2) at No. 13 Southern California (5-0)  Chad Davis of Washington State beat Oregon State, completing 21 of 28 passes for 274 yards and 3 touchdowns. Not this time.   Arizona (3-2) at No. 24 U.C.L.A. (3-2)  U.C.L.A. can pass. The last time out, its freshman quarterback, Cade McNown, went 18 for 22 for 274 yards and 3 touchdowns against Fresno State.  MISMATCHES  Missouri (2-3) at No. 5 Nebraska (5-0)  Nebraska has won 16 straight from Missouri. The Huskers are six-touchdown favorites and may win by more.  Wake Forest (1-5) at No. 7 Florida State (5-0)  Florida State has won 12 straight, and Warrick Dunn is averaging 184 yards rushing. Look for a blowout by six or seven touchdowns.

The trio, which is appearing at the Ballroom (253 West 28th Street) through New Year's Eve, performs songs popularized in the 1930's and40's by the Mills Brothers, the Boswell Sisters and Paul Whiteman's Rhythm Boys in a light, smooth blend. The members accompany themselves on a variety of instruments, including drums and piano. They also do several dance routines that pay tribute to the vaudevillian antics of Honi Coles as well as the more playful side of Fred Astaire, although Astaire's gliding elegance eludes them.    Without straining for comedy, the trio's new show finds gentle merriment in the contrasts between the members' personalities. Hal Shane, who tap-dances and plays the guitar and banjo, exudes a patriarchal stance that contrasts with the gee-whiz enthusiasm of Tripp Hanson, and with Brian Nalepka, its bassist, who looks on like a cheerful watchdog.    The outstanding vocal moments at the show on Friday evening included a languid rendition of \\"Smoke Rings,\\" the 1930's theme song of Glen Gray's Casa Loma Orchestra and a version of the Boswell Sisters' song \\"Sentimental Gentleman From Georgia,\\" which was as buoyant as it was light. The high point was \\"The Afterbeat,\\" a number choreographed by Mr. Tune, in which Mr. Hanson, dancing with Mr. Shane, became a kind of robotic puppet who followed his every move so closely that their two bodies seemed to merge.

The only chink in CBS's Thursday armor was ''Without a Trace,'' which reached second place in the 18-to-49 demographic: once again, it lost to NBC's ''ER,'' despite drawing nearly 6 million more viewers in total (21.33 million versus 15.34 million). CBS's ''Survivor,'' however, dominated the 8 p.m. hour in the 18-to-49 age group, as well as in the wider audience, with 18.98 million viewers. But WB's ''Smallville,'' also at 8, continued to be one of the season's biggest surprises, beating all the other networks among men 18 to 34, its target audience. In that demographic, the Clark Kent series's move to Thursday nights has allowed WB to increase its audience by 163 percent from last year in the 8 p.m. slot.

They're expendable manpower in the war to man the desks, mops and bottom-drawer duties of the behind-the-scenes world of luxury hotels, where they're unnoticed by the public, and underpaid and overworked by their employers. This is an urban-legend horror story rendered with grim intelligence by the man with the right tools for the job: Stephen Frears. This understated and sure film is set in a world of survivors. One of them, the Nigerian Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) — who drives a cab and also works as a hotel porter under the large thumb of the smooth operator night manager, Sneaky, a smooth operator (Sergi Lopez) — seems to be as haunted as he is obsessed. The film doesn't elaborate on the troubles that have sent Okwe so far from home","excerpt":"all we really know is that he has left a wife and a daughter behind, and part of his pain comes from pining for them.

He's capable of loyalty to the rest of his ad hoc family —  to Guo Yi (Benedict Wong), the mortuary attendant, and the dangerously close-to-cliché, lovable hooker (Sophie Okonedo).

Why is salt added to the ice in a hand-cranked ice cream freezer when the primary effect would seem to be the lowering of the mixture's freezing point - and thus a melting of the ice? Does this in some way enhance the removal of heat from the ice cream?   A. Indeed it does. Ice is very effective as a coolant not because it is so cold, but because it takes so much heat to melt it. The heat of fusion of water - the amount of heat absorbed by ice in changing from the solid to the liquid state - is extremely high, 79.71 calories per gram at zero degrees centigrade, the normal melting temperature of freshwater ice. A gram of ice will absorb only about 10 calories in rising to zero from 20 below zero. Once zero is attained, however, almost 80 calories are absorbed in changing the ice to water at the same temperature. However, with ice at zero degrees centigrade (32 degrees Fahrenheit), ice cream cannot be made","excerpt":"all you get is a cold, sweet soup, until a temperature around 5 degrees below zero centigrade is reached. And, according to the second law of thermodynamics, no amount of ice melting at zero degrees can ever cool anything to a temperature below zero. Adding salt to lower the ice's melting temperature allows heat to flow from the ice cream mix to the melting ice at temperatures considerably below the melting temperature of freshwater ice, and below the temperature at which ice cream will freeze.

''You call yourself a producer,'' Mr. Mamet recalls saying, ''but you don't know how to create anything","excerpt":"all you know how to do is destroy.'' Mr. Schoenfeld quickly snapped back that Mr. Mamet did not know how to write plays, and the two men stalked off in opposite directions.   The issue at hand was not a play or a script, but the building of the proposed Portman Hotel in Times Square, which last week actually began with the razing of several properties on West 45th Street. Mr. Schoenfeld supports the hotel's construction because he believes it will help revitalize the theater district, catalyzing further development and infusing much needed money into the area; Mr. Mamet is opposed to the project because it entails the demolition of the Morosco and Helen Hayes theaters, which he feels should be cherished and preserved.
