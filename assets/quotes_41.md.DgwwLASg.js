His career includes such achievements as \\"The Passion of Joan of Arc\\" and \\"Ordet.\\" It also includes some melancholy silences.From 1920 to 1932 Mr. Dreyer made 10 feature films. After a lapse of 11 years, his last four features (to date) were made over a period of 21 years.The reason for the long silences are not all known, but the harmful effect of this inactivity is visible in his most recent film. \\"Gertrud,\\" which opened yesterday at the New Yorker, was made in 1964 after a pause since 1955. Our regret is not only for the unmade Dreyer films. The waiting—this last wait, particularly—seems to have sequestered him from contemporary life and, in a sense, from his own past film-making life.\\"Gertrud\\" is based on a play of the same name by the Swede Hjalmar Soderberg, written in 1906. The heroine is a former opera singer, now married to a prominent lawyer who is about to enter the government. She feels that she is secondary to his career (although he certainly tries to demonstrate otherwise). She begins an affair with a young composer who, she thinks, can fulfill her ideal of Love as Life","excerpt":"but she finds that she is only a conquest to him.Before marriage, she had left a lover, a celebrated poet of love, when she discovered that she was secondary to his career. Now she leaves her husband, presumably to live alone.There is an epilogue that is perhaps unintentionally revealing. As an old lady, Gertrude is living alone in the country with one servant, an old man. During a scene with a visitor, she addresses only one remark to the old man: \\"Don't forget to wash the kitchen floor.\\"She tells her visitor that she wants \\"Amor Omnia\\" on her tombstone, but the one male servant and her treatment of him suggest that \\"Revenge\\" might do as well.Mr. Dreyer's theme — the suffering of a woman who finds that men do not devote themselves entirely to love, that they also concern themselves with their careers—can just as easily be seen as feminine egotism instead of male egotism. But this whole subject of Love as Life can hardly be taken seriously today. The script seems a pallid post-Ibsen revolt against the idea of woman as chattel or toy. In these days of \\"feminine mystique\\" it doesn't seem to be Love as Life that concerns women. They seem to want exactly what men want: All of Life as Life. And if they share the same hopes, they share much the same disappointments. The spiritual hierarchy of the sexes in \\"Gertrud\\" seems as dated as the costumes.But Mr. Dreyer takes this Soderberg play seriously—one index that he is out of touch. Worse, his technique is the least fluently cinematic of any work of his that I know.Its slowness will not surprise those familiar with Dreyer. His tempos have always been deliberate. But here his camera movement and his editing defy the minimal drama in the script. In dialogue the camera often travels back and forth from face to face, instead of cutting from one to the other. \\"Direction\\" frequently consists of having characters rise from one sofa, move slowly to another, then sink. Nothing that can be done at length is ever suggested. (When Gertrud goes to rehearse a song at the composer's studio, she sings the whole song.)Further proof of Mr. Dreyer's far remove is his use of Nina Pens Rode as Gertrud. This lady is not only unappealing, she is limited to about one and a half facial expressions and somewhat less emotional fire. It is hard to credit the various gentlemen who express passion for her or who weep with regret at having lost her. Answering one lover's query about her character, Miss Pens Rode replies (according to the subtitles from the Danish) that she is dew, she is white clouds, she is the moon. The meteorological comparison does not hold water.The various gentlemen — Bendt Rothe, Ebbe Rode and Baard Owe—do as well as they can with their difficult assignments.Mr. Dreyer has a famous gift for pictorial composition and for apt lighting. This has often been partly a curse to him, as, for instance, in \\"Day of Wrath,\\" where the film frequently pauses to imitate 17th-century Dutch painting. But in his best films there has always been an underlying human concern that sustained us through any longueurs of execution. Here, under the slow, posed pictures, there is nothing but the dated theme described above.The man whose intense love for men informed so many well-wrought films will probably never be forgotten as long as films are remembered. Whether or not one likes all of his works, there is in his life and person a quality that can be called angelic. \\"Gertrud,\\" however, is the work—not of a fallen angel—but of a very old one.

CITY OPERA: MISS MARSEE IN 'CARMEN'"},{"year":"1930","title":"Appealing musical compositions, agreeably sung and well played, compensate for imperfections in the dialogue and story of \\"Viennese Nights,\\" a Vitaphone operetta in Technicolor, which was offered last night by Warner Brothers at Warners' Theatre. A few sequences may be a trifle slow, and when Alan Crosland, the director, indulges his fancy in imaginative episodes he frequently gives too much of it, but nevertheless this is a picture with virtues that decidedly counterbalance its shortcomings. In fact, when one harks back to some other film operettas this feature reveals marked progress.In the program it is set forth that the story is based upon a romance written specially for the screen by Sigmund Romberg and Oscar Hammerstein 2d. It is a happy-go-lucky affair which at times recalls Jessie Fothergill's novel \\"The First Violin,\\" and in the closing chapters it possesses incidents that suggest Noel Coward's production \\"Bitter Sweet.\\"It is primarily a musical entertainment, but at the same time one in which its none too novel narrative often captivates one's interest. The fact that the characters suddenly give vent to their feelings in song and that they are occasionally accompanied by an unseen orchestra, does not worry one, because the singing is invariably satisfactory and the ballads are beguiling. Alexander Gray acts well and sings with an effect that is rarely heard from the screen. Vivienne Segal has at last her opportunity in this picture, for not only is her voice nicely recorded","excerpt":"but she looks far more attractive than she has in other cinema productions. This is especially marked in the penultimate scenes.This romance begins in Vienna in 1880, when Otto, a budding composer; Franz, a young nobleman, and Gus, a comic individual, are beheld on the eve of joining their regiment. Later, when the troops return, Elsa goes to the balcony of her home and both Otto and Franz are captivated by this charming girl.Hocher, Elsa's father, at first appears to have a kindly nature, but subsequently he arranges matters so that Otto is led to believe that Elsa is in love with Franz. The composer imbibes too freely of wine and then makes a fool of himself and Elsa therefore cannot be blamed for choosing to become the bride of the philandering Franz.The stupid Otto, instead of remaining a bachelor, marries a nagging woman who has no sympathy with music. This is stressed with a vengeance by Mr. Crosland, who depicts the tired Otto, eleven years later a second fiddler in the opera in New York, trying to compose music on a piano while his wife is volleying her disapproval from her bedroom and urging her husband to take a job in Gus's highly successful pickle factory.One night Franz and his wife attend the opera and Elsa recognizes Otto. After the performance she bids the musician ride in her carriage through the park, but although they both declare their love for each other she decides to accompany her husband back to Europe.When a subtitle announced that forty years pass, the audience last night was rather amused. Soon one perceives Elsa as a gray-haired woman who is inveigled into going to listen to a new composer's symphony played by a large orchestra. Otto's son has also studied music. He succeeds where his father had failed. Elsa rises out of her wheel chair, after leaving her seat in the hall, and limps back to listen to the music because she hears a familiar theme composed by the unfortunate Otto.Although Mr. Crosland lingers here and there on some pet idea, his direction is far superior to most of his pictures, and certainly infinitely superior to his recent contributions.Mr. Hersholt gives his usual diligent care to his part. Mr. Pidgeon is fair in his rôle. Bert Roach is rather out of his element in such a story.The Technicolor camera work is a little dark in some of the scenes, but it has its good points in others. In showing a butcher's shop, the Technicolor camera men ought to beware of raw meat, for its tint is anything but real in a flash of this film. The glimpses of uniforms of officers and the gowns of women, however, benefit by this prismatic photography. THE SCREEN; A Vitaphone Operetta in Technicolor."},{"year":"1958","title":"LEWISBORO, N.

I quiz them by using those words in our language that have Latin and Greek word parts, like autobiography, computer, heterogeneous, bibliophile, so that they come to understand the secret of vocabulary as a study of word parts.   With the list of 300 they have a better chance of understanding what they read, hear and see. I do not teach toward the Scholastic Aptitude Test, but my students come back and tell me how much the vocabulary list helped them.   Ancient and dead languages are still being used to name new ideas, things and events: quid pro quo, computer language, escalator and the like. Not to teach these languages deprives students of the inner working of established businesses: law, medicine, government, thus further separating rich from poor, new from old.

Schundler, a leading contender in the Republican primary for governor of New Jersey.    ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with a shot of an elderly man watching Mr. Schundler as he stands at a lectern speaking. As inspiring music swells, the camera cuts between Mr. Schundler onstage and awestruck members of his audience: one man holding a baby, another man who nods in agreement and a woman who appears nearly misty-eyed.    THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Schundler says: ''Seniors losing the homes they've lived in for decades because they can't afford the property taxes. Young couples having to delay the dream of owning a home because they can't afford the property taxes. That's why I've started a property tax revolution. It's time to end the Trenton politicians' out-of-control spending. Let's stand up and tell the greedy politicians, 'We're not going to take it anymore!''' An announcer says: ''Bret Schundler. Taking the power of people, and turning it on.''    ACCURACY -- The ad gives a dramatic, but not-unrealistic, description of some of the hardships caused by New Jersey's property taxes, the highest in the nation. It is also correct in identifying state spending as one significant cause of the problem","excerpt":"but some elected officials might dispute the characterization of politicians as ''greedy'' or Mr. Schundler's contention that they alone are to blame for the problem.    SCORECARD -- By trumpeting his determination to lower property taxes, Mr. Schundler is hoping to harness the outrage that has made the issue the top concern of the New Jersey electorate this year. The inspirational tone of the commercial -- it even borrows a line from Peter Finch, who played the rabble-rousing television anchor in the film ''Network'' -- is also a reminder that Mr. Schundler is a maverick who upended the Democratic machine in Jersey City and defied the Republican establishment to seize the party's nomination for governor in 2001. But Mr. Schundler has been promoting his property tax plan for months, and recent polls show that many New Jerseyans prefer the tax relief proposal by Douglas R. Forrester, his chief rival. So the fact that Mr. Schundler must use one of his precious television spots at the close of the campaign to try to recapture the mantle of the property tax crusader is a sign that his campaign is straining to contend with Mr. Forrester's formidable financial advantage.

Died on December 5 in New York-Cornell Hospital of ALS. Carol was a warm, insightful, giving person and a source of strength and support to her many friends. These traits also pervaded her professional life. After receiving an M.A. in education from the University of Massachusetts, she briefly taught school","excerpt":"but soon turned to social work as her career. She received an MSW from Fordham University and spent 25 years at St. Vincent's Services in Brooklyn, working first on the development of their Foster Boarding Program, and from 1980 to 1992, serving as Director of the Agency's Foster Care and Adoption Services. As the number of children served by St. Vincent's Services grew, she never lost sight of the individual entrusted to her care. Her Director's door was always open to those children and families in need of her counsel or intervention. Her friends will miss her caring nature, her ready response to their needs, her wise counsel and her fun-loving sense of humor. A gifted communicator and speaker, she was cruelly deprived of speech by her illness, but she adapted to the Internet to maintain contact with her friends and family, which was so important to her and to them. She showed immense bravery in the long course of her rare, incurable illness, fighting each day to maintain dignity and mastery of herself. She bore her illness without complaint or self-pity. Her caring extended to the plight of animals. She was an advocate for the protection of Carriage Horses in New York City. In her honor, donations may be made to the World Wildlife Fund, 1250 Twenty-Fourth St., NW, Washington, DC 20037. Carol leaves a brother, Dr. William Schwartz of Los Angeles; a niece, Laurie Schwartz, and nephew, Dr. Eric Schwartz of Boston; and dear friends Helen Morris, Ann Davis and Josh of New York City.

Peggy loves horses and thinks that Sam Harrington is a famous steeplechase rider of the same name of whom she has heard. So, against his will and with much foreboding, Sam Harrington poses as the celebrated horseman. But he can't stop, as he would like, to, at wearing horsey clothes. He must ride, and because he is such a wonderful rider, as they think, they mount him on The Hottentot, the wildest beast on four legs in the county??? He lives??? But he does not escape. He must ride The Hottentot again, in the steeplechase—and he does—and he wins—but Gilpin's ride was tame, Mazeppa had pleasant afternoon canter, compared to the cross-country career of said Sam Harrington on The Hottentot.This, you may remember, is the story of William Collier's far???, \\"The Hottentot,\\" and it is now the story of the film of the same name which is at the Strand this week, with Douglas MacLean suffering in the rôle out of which Mr. Collier got so much hilarious agony on the stage. And Mr. MacLean suffers as well, as hilariously, that, is. His every bounce is a laugh, his every fall a roar.For they have made a merry screen farce of \\"The Hottentot.\\" In some respects it outdoes ??? stage production, for, by the trickery of the camera and the open spaces it can go into, they have been able to show the riding—and the bouncing and the falling—that could be only talked about on the stage. In a photoplay of this nature, of course, everything depends upon how it is done. The idea is simple and obvious and needs bright, skillful treatment to become really funny, and this is just what it does on the screen. Del Andrews and James W. Horne, who directed the production, have done a good job. They have maintained a stimulating, breakneck tempo??? they have staged a number of ????dingly clever scenes, and they have kept the continuity of the piece. Result: \\"The Hottentot\\" moves alon??? merrily and the spectator laughs as it goes. It's darned good fun.It's all a lot of foolishness, of course, and it would be better in two or three reels than in the five or six allowed it","excerpt":"but spirited foolishness is a welcome relief from the laboring solemnity of most photoplays, and the padding of the picture has been so well distributed that you never have very long to wai??? between laughs. So there's nothing very serious to complain of—and lots to be boisterously thankful for.In giving credit to the directors, however, even though they deserve the bulk of it, one must not overlook the work of Douglas MacLean. His part doesn't require any serious acting ability, but it does require ??? certain comic instinct which he supplies in abundance. He makes his funny scenes funny, and that's no little thing to do, as you who have seen many so-called comedians struggling in vain can testify. He is abetted, too, by Raymond Hatton as a sympath??? butler, and the others in the cast do the little required of them.

They eddy and change color, from ridiculous to obscene to puerile","excerpt":"but stars keep falling into them.As a playwright, Mr. Arrabal has his own lodging in the Theater of the Absurd: It is called the Theater of Panic. As a novice film maker, he charges the medium head on.There is a lot of damage any halfway competent movie director could have warned him about; and a measure of splintered brilliance that no halfway competent movie director could have dreamed of.In \\"Guernica,\\" which opened at the 68th Street Playhouse yesterday, Mr. Arrabal, an exiled Spaniard, has given us his Civil War. It is grotesque and painful, absurdly obvious in parts, rough and chaotic almost throughout. It is almost totally one-sided—and yet in its own highly personal way it is authentic. It is the Civil War as nightmare, but its obscenity and ferocity are metaphors for tenderness.The setting is an imaginary village called Villa Romero, set in Extremadura, the most barren and backward of Spain's regions. With no subtlety at all, the film sets out its cast of characters.Vandale, played by Mariangela Melato, is a beautiful hermit, half-witch. Count Cerralbo is the rural landlord who rails against the Republic and the loss of his authority. He has three brutal sons who ride around assaulting peasant women and meeting in a cellar to plan their part in the Franco uprising.The fourth son, Goya, is a Surrealist artist who despises politics. He breaks up first-communion services by telling the children the wine is poisoned, paints obscene crucifixion scenes and sits through a scolding by his father while masturbating quietly into his brandy glass.The Nationalist rising takes place, but in Villa Romero it fails. The landlord's sons flee to join Franco's troops, the landlord climbs into the village school and is hidden by the schoolmaster, a Republican but an advocate of nonviolence.Vandale and Goya flee separately for France. They meet in the town of Guernica, fall in love instantly (a dove flies in slow motion from one to the other to symbolize it), and are separated when Guernica is bombed.She returns to Villa Romero and, no longer a hermit, rallies the villagers to fight the oncoming Franco troops. He gets an airplane and machine-guns the besiegers' cannons. Ultimatly the village falls, Vandale and Goya are made prisoner, and he is tortured. She manages to escape and free him. They climb to the mountains and against an enormous setting sun, embrace: symbols of a future Spanish liberation.That is the plot, with all its farfetched melodrama. The film's strength is elsewhere; in images that express the savage yearnings and excesses that were the fuel of a terrible civil war. Many of the villagers are dwarfs: Arrabal uses them to symbolize the oppression of a people. \\"Now we will be like everyone,\\" one dwarf declares—it is a flash of pain—when the village invades the landlord's castle.There are other blinding sights. Children move in a slow-motion procession up a hill; the soundtrack alternates their guttural chanting with an anthem; the effect is to bind up in one image churchgoing and church-burning Spain. There is an unbearable but inspired scene after the Republic is defeated: A bullfighter, using all the gestures and postures of his art, fights and kills five dwarfs lashed to wheelbarrows. The audience is the army, the church, the upper classes; the national anthem plays.These things, intolerable as they may seem, succeed beyond all reasonable expectations. Many other things fail; and the film's technical carelessness (it is filmed in Italy but even the Italian dubbing is sloppy—at one point Miss Melato is speaking Italian and the crowd is answering in Spanish drags it down further.Miss Melato is a good actress but she doesn't have the force for the role. Her singing of one of the great Civil War songs is almost prim. On the other hand the American actor Ron Faber, playing Goya, makes a first-rate Spaniard.Rough, ridiculous, arbitrary: \\"Guernica\\" is a film designed to make the spectator fight it. The remarkable thing is that it frequently wins.

These exteriors have been made with a keen eye for their artistic values, not only for the scenes themselves but also for the effects of shadows. The glimpse one has of the skyline of Algerian structures will linger long in one's memory, as will also the distant view of a caravan in the desert. The vast expenses of sand, with the hillocks and ripples, sometimes without a human form, are like a swelling sea. Then there are the archways that would make an artist long for his brushes and palette.The costuming of the various characters has also been done most meticulously and those episodes in a monastery are remarkable as specimens of authentic atmosphere. Yet the story of this romance of the monk and the Englishwoman suffers when compared with its enchanting background. It has been difficult to produce for more reasons than one. The director evidently wanted to avoid offending any religious body and he had also to steer clear of censorial eyes. Then, so many desert stories have been produced in the last few years that this subject has been robbed of much of its original glamour and drama. In the old days of pictures sandstorms were something dramatic, but at present it is just another gust of wind passing over the desert. The suffering of the characters is not particularly impressive, and yet when one ponders over this sandstorm chapter it has been accomplished with no little skill. It is not thrilling because it has lost its novelty, and then there are the coincidental happenings that in a way destroy the illusion of distance.Alice Terry, impassive but beautiful, does not strike one as the type for Domini Enfilden. Perhaps if she had put more fire into her performance and appeared without her usual blond wig she would have been more convincing. She is phlegmatic in nearly all the scenes, and her expressions in this instance are not, one might say, really sufficiently varied. Of course, she looks sad, anxious and to a certain extent in love. But there is no tenseness about her acting. Ivan Petrovich, as Father Adrien, who is also known as Boris Androvsky, does very well for several chapters of the story, but he is frequently guilty of artificial actions and expressions—registering, for instance, in anything but an easy way his realization that Count Anteoni suddenly remembers that he met him (Boris) some time before in a monastery. There are a number of other instances of Mr. Petrovich's theatric expressions.Mr. Ingram seems to have been ever on the alert to introduce comedy, and some of it is not nearly as funny on the screen as it may have been while it was being pictured. The peculiar movements of the ungainly camels are much more comic than some of the antics of the grotesque little creature who is supposed to evoke fun in this feature. So far as the other players are concerned they perform their tasks with some ability, but it is doubtful whether they succeed in doing much more than obey Mr. Ingram's instructions, for none of the characterizations are compelling.Whether it is when Domini and Boris are battling for life against the sandstorm or when they are enjoying their romance the effect is never ??? might be. The story is stilted, despite the fact that some of the individual episodes are told quite well.A Missed Opportunity.THE main idea of \\"The Life of Riley\\" might easily have been improved in tone by a more carefully written story and vastly subdued actions of the players. It holds out promise of something with real wit, such as a W. W. Jacobs story, but so keen have been the producers to introduce gags that the story is lost amid the gymnastics of the players. Where you have a volunteer fire chief and a volunteer police chief as rivals for the hand of a really charming widow, known as Penelope Jones, you would think that the producers for once might have foregone the usual temptation to indulge in semi-slapstick and, instead, have put some real human interest into the narrative.The gags in this comic contraption are not without merit, judged by a low order of humor. They reveal some ingenuity and the performances of the principals, George Sidney, Myrtle Stedman, Sam Hardy and Charles Murray, are quite competent. With the exception of Mr. Murray, all these players are capable of portraying something more subdued than the hectic actions of the clown-characters in this yarn. To give \\"The Life of Riley\\" its due, it is something that is bound to reap its reward of laughter—that is, very loud laughter, not the chuckles and partly stifled merriment that greeted Adolphe Menjou's last picture, \\"Service for Ladies.\\"Water and Beauty.A SPORTS contest against a background of the sea and the sands, with pretty girls and dainty costumes, goes a long way to making a good entertainment. It may be a reckless story such as that of \\"Swim, Girl, Swim,\\" which held forth at the Paramount Theatre last week, but there is a certain type of film wherein nonsense is apt to be pardoned because it is amusing. There is nothing outstandingly original about this Bebe Daniels farce, but there is no gainsaying the fact that its swiftly moving scenes make a good impression.The structure of the story is not dissimilar from those of the old-time race horse yarns, wherein the favorite was rushed to the starting point after having been scratched and without the jockey undergoing the formality of being weighed. And this horse was the only one on which you could bet and be perfectly sure it would win.In the latter chapters of \\"Swim, Girl, Swim,\\" you are informed that Bebe Daniels is twenty miles away from the starting point of the college swimming race, just when all the other contestants are ready to dive into the water. Miss Daniels starts off in a limousine, which is eventually stopped by motorcycle policemen, and then, after slipping away from these minions of the law, she and her friends make haste aboard a truck, which soon has a flat tire. Nevertheless, as in the case of the race horse, you would be astonished if Miss Daniels did not eventually reach the scene of the race in the nick of time and come out triumphant. Yet the audience in the Paramount was quite satisfied and evidently enjoyed the shrieking suspense engendered by the mishaps suffered by Miss Daniels in her dash to the swimming race.Here there is also a professor who, when Miss Daniels is anything but a star swimmer, pulls her aboard his boat. He finds that she is unconscious and in his absent-minded way he offers the poor girl chloroform instead of ammonia. It may be silly but it raised howls of merriment. And so did some titles in which this professor addresses Gertrude Ederle as \\"Old Sardine\\" and \\"Old Smelt.\\"Miss Ederle is perceived giving an exhibition of her expert diving and swimming. In the story she coaches Miss Daniels, with the result that although her pupil takes to the water after the other contestants have begun the big race she (Miss Daniels) makes such, remarkable speed that she not only overtakes the other girls but leaves them far behind.Pretty but Poor.ANOTHER feature, \\"The Joy Girl,\\" which adorned the Roxy screen, possesses some of the entertainment features of \\"Swim, Girl, Swim.\\" \\"The Joy Girl\\" is a story that is just about as likely as the Bebe Daniels picture. It is expensively produced, with natural color chapters at the beginning and end. The acting of the players suits the mood of this tale of a poor but pretty girl in Palm Beach. Her mother is willing to wait hand and foot on her charming daughter with a view to encouraging the girl to marry only a millionaire. The mother, it is true, hopes that Jewel's millionaire will be young, handsome and loving. Jewel has opportunities to go into partnership with a girl friend who is a Palm Beach milliner, but she wants to please her mother, so she bides her time until a millionaire appears on the scene.In this picture there is the familiar idea of a wealthy and good-looking young man deciding in a spirit of adventure to permit his valet to pose as himself while he officiates as the valet's chauffeur. It is not in the least surprising that Jewel feels her young heart palpitate after a short acquaintance with the supposed chauffeur. But she is adamant in wanting to carry out her mother's wishes. Therefore, when the impostor, masquerading as his employer, meets Jewel and shows her an expensive diamond ring and breathes words that tell of fabulous riches, Jewel decides to forget all about the chauffeur and marry the young, good-looking millionaire.Jewel throughout this story delights in pretense. She makes believe she has a car, that she lives in a gorgeous pile of masonry and all that sort of thing. The real millionaire knows that she has no car and the house she elects to call her own happens to be his.Olive Borden is winsome as Jewel. Neil Hamilton is efficient as the nice young man and Jerry Miley is amusing as the nonchalant impostor. Marie Dressier supplies some ponderous humor as the susceptible widow of an oil king.\\"The Guardsman.\\"FAULTY though it is, the Austrian screen version of Franz Molnar's play, \\"The Guardsman,\\" is not without a fair supply of fun. This effort contains little or none of the subtlety of the original and the director, Robert Wiene, spoils some incidents by repetition. It would be quite enough for the Actor, who wishes to ascertain whether or not his wife is faithful to him, to transform himself once, during his performance of Hamlet, into a dazzling guardsman. Mr. Wiene insists on the worried or anxious husband changing between every intermission and also having his dresser put on a different uniform every time he comes to call the supposed guardsman while he is flirting with his own wife in a box in the theatre in which he is acting the part of the melancholy Dane.Maria Corda, who is now in Hollywood working in the film translation of \\"The Private Life of Helen of Troy,\\" wears some striking costumes in the course of her portrayal of the wife in this photoplay. In character she rebuffs the supposed guardsman and her husband is elated","excerpt":"but subsequently when he discovers that his amorous attentions are not repelled with vigor he appears to be both disappointed and puzzled.\\"The Guardsman\\" is the type of idea that ought to have been treated with less buffoonery and more subtlety, despite the fact that it is never tedious and is even funny in its absurd passages.THE Colony Theatre, which reopened on Friday evening under the management of Hugo Riesenfeld with the film version of \\"The Cat and the Canary,\\" is to permit smoking in the loge seats.For the last week Harold Lloyd, who came here to film some scenes for his next comedy, has profited by every hour of sunshine. He has been to Coney Island, to the Battery, the Plaza Hotel and Button Piece. Mr. Lloyd said that fully 2,000 persons gathered around him when he was acting for some scenes in front of the Pennsylvania Station.Production has been started on Esther Ralston's new picture, an untitled story of the stage. Neil Hamilton will play the leading male rôle in this feature, which is being directed by Frank Tuttle.

Britain Cuts Back"},{"year":"1931","title":"Edna May Oliver, whose various screen characterizations have been eminently successful, is rather unfortunate in the selection of her first starring picture, \\"Fanny Foley Herself,\\" which is now on view at the Warner Theatre. Miss Oliver makes the most of her part, but even with her commendable acting and a charming performance by Helen Chandler, the story itself is tedious.This film is photographed in Technicolor. There are greenish skies, steel-tinted nights, amber lights, frocks and gowns of pastel shades, most of this prismatic work being quite well done. But whether it is, on the whole, more effective than, black and white is a matter of opinion. It may not help Miss Oliver much, but it does enhance to some degree the attractiveness of Miss Chandler.The producers have seen fit to have Miss Oliver appear in this current production as Fanny Foley, a vaudeville performer who earns $1,000 a week. She hears during an early period of the tale that her husband, the son of a multi-millionaire named Seely, has died. The father has not seen his son since the latter married Fanny Foley. Seely senior does not even appear at his son's funeral.So soon as the husband is out of the way, the picture begins to be interested in Fanny's two daughters, one a broad-minded little person and the other quite a snob. In other words, Carmen is a Foley and Lenore a Seely. Their grandfather is anxious to have them with him, or at least under his wing, but Fanny decides to go on working, and she therefore spurns the grandfather's offer of an income with reservations.Fanny sends her daughters to an expensive school in Washington, and when she is to appear on the vaudeville stage in the capital, Carmen and Lenore watch their mother from a box. It is really no wonder that they are disappointed, for, although the rest of the screen audience goes wild with enthusiasm for Fanny Foley, it is difficult to understand what all the fuss is about. Carmen and Lenore, however, are both chagrined that their mother should have to do such a low comedy act to earn a living.If those who view this production have any doubt as to its satisfactory ending, let it be dispelled. No information one might convey in type could ever detract from this yarn, which seldom strays from a familiar formula.Here and there one finds that the incidents swing from sentiment to farce. Fanny, in her eagerness in one sequence to reach her daughters quickly, travels by airplane and when she hears that the pilot cannot land and will have to return to his starting point, Fanny leaps out of the plane, counting up to 300 instead of 3 before opening her parachute","excerpt":"but that does not matter, for she lands safely. In fact it is the kind of parachute that needs a 300 count.Hobart Bosworth is conscientious as Seely. Florence Roberts tries hard to be amusing in the rôle of Fanny's faithful servant. Rochelle Hudson is a little artificial as Carmen, but Miss Chandler is excellent as Lenore. THE SCREEN; Farce and Sentiment. A Gangster Comedy. Movietone News.

Why, it is difficult to understand, for there are interludes that are absurdly amateurish in direction and the leading feminine players are very disappointing.David Golder, a Polish emigrant, who after years in New York and European capitals become sa power in the financial and business world, never really impresses one as being really a power","excerpt":"but that is the story. His wealth fails to bring him anything but unhappiness, for his wife, Gloria, in her desire to forget her humble origin, is constantly worrying her husband for money. She has an expensive car, but sells it and buys an even costlier one. Money is ever uppermost in her mind and she would far sooner have riches than her spouse. His daughter, Joyce, is perhaps not quite as selfish, but she has little time to devote to her adipose father.A few flashes show that Joyce is enjoying herself on the beach at Biarritz, where her father has a villa. When David arrives at the resort from Paris, he discovers that his own room is occupied by a guest of his wife's and he is forced to make shift in a servant's modest room. He has several heart attacks in the course of this film, and one expects that he is going to die after a ridiculous struggle with his wife, who cooly informs him that Joyce is not his daughter. In another sequence he plays baccarat and wins a million francs, which he gives to his daughter and then collapses. Presumably the fortune in francs is left on the floor and on a settee while Joyce and others go to Golder's rescue.Eventually David finds himself alone in his Paris abode. Joyce one day visits him and his old friend Tubingen approaches him with an imposing plan concerned with Soviet oil concessions. He goes to Russia, makes a satisfactory deal and there is the ironic touch when he breathes his last aboard a small steamship, after confiding in a young Polish emigrant, who is about to visit the outside world with the hope of amassing wealth. Golder musters up sufficient strength before he dies to sign a paper giving all his wealth to Joyce and, as for the young Pole, who acts as the old man's messenger, he is told that he can have all the cash in Golder's pockets.There is no idea of sound perspective in this film, which rather causes it to remind one of the first Hollywood audible ventures. The studio accoustics were evidently very poor. The action leaps from Paris to Biarritz and from Biarritz to Paris and from Paris to Russia in a curiously abrupt fashion.

Gardner Sullivan, his scenarist, to begin with a certain arbitrarily chosen situation and end with another situation as arbitrarily selected, was responsible for the \\"character development,\\"—development? Aye! revolution — that occurs in \\"Hail the Woman.\\"That's the impression the whole story makes. It abounds in insincerities. It is full of purely theatrical situations.Its title indicates that it is a glorification of woman, and it surely glorifies her from the start. It tells how woman, in whom there is a \\"divine spark,\\" has always been mistreated by man, and it shows some of the mistreatment by the Puritanical father and his pusillanimous son. Can't you hear every wife in the theatre say to herself, or to her husband if he happens to be along, \\"You see there?\\" That's the point the photoplay seeks to score, it being well known that more women than men attend the movies, and it drives hard for it.But, after all, the old Puritan is the father of the heroine, and his son is the real hero of the story, so they can't be left unregenerate. The public— that is, the fourteen-year-old part of it—wouldn't like that. Hence the baby, to soften the old man and put a backbone in the youth. Would you say the story had the courage of its convictions? And doesn't it strike you that if the two men selected to illustrate man's abuse of woman are so easily mollified and ennobled, the women of the world have been pretty stupid through the ages for not using their babies to better advantage?But there's the cast—Theodora Roberts, Florence Vidor, Tully Marshell, Lloyd Hughes and the others. They are about as good as you could find. Don't they also seem a part of the deliberate play for the crowds, however? To put them in such a story as \\"Hail the Woman\\" is surely to use them to put over the hokum. Of course, they can't help vitalizing some of their scenes. You couldn't reduce them to utter banality if you wanted to. But the story is so obviously fabricated for the fans, and its \\"moral purpose\\" is laid on so thickly, that, their good work goes for little or nothing most of the time.Still, it is only fair to add that Mr. Ince's remarks, quoted above, were not made without \\"Hail the Woman\\" in mind. They are included in a statement issued in connection with the release of the picture, and elsewhere in the statement Mr. Ince says expressly that he planned \\"Hail the Woman\\" as \\"the greatest drama of my long experience as a motion-picture producer\\" and that the photoplay is his answer to the question, \\"What kind of picture does the public want?\\" So, apparently, he has confidence in the film.

The conditions of human life have not only been changed, but revolutionized, within the past few hundred years. In former days there was little difference between the dwelling, dress, food, and environment of the chief and those of his retainers. The Indians are to-day where civilized man then was. When visiting the Sioux, I was led to the wigwam of the chief. It was like the others in external appearance, and even within the difference was trifling between it and those of the poorest of his braves. The contrast between the palace of the millionaire and the cottage of the laborer with us to-day measures the change which has come with civilization. This I change, however, is not to be deplored, but welcomed as highly beneficial. It--is well,nay, essential, for the progress of the race that the houses of some should be homes for all that is highest and best in literature and the arts, and for all the refinements of civilization, rather than that none should be so. Much better this great irregularity than universal squalor. Without wealth there can be no Mcecenas. The \\"good old times\\" were not good old times. Neither master nor servant was as well situated then as to-day. A relapse to old conditions would be disastrous to both-not the least so to him who serves-and would sweep away civilization with it. But whether the change be for good or ill, it is upon us, beyond our power to alter, and, therefore, to be accepted and made the best of. It is a waste of time to criticize the inevitable. It is easy to see how the change has come. One illustration will serve for almost every phase of the cause. In the manufacture of products we have the whole story. It applies to all combinations of human industry, as stimulated and enlarged by the inventions of this scientific age. Formerly, articles were manufactured at the domestic hearth, or in small shops which formed part of the household. The master and his apprentices worked side by side, the latter living with the master, and therefore subject to the same conditions. When these apprentices rose to be masters, there was little or no change in their mode of life, and they, in turn, educated succeeding apprentices in the same routine. There was, substantially, social equality, and even political equality, for those engaged in industrial pursuits had then little or no voice in the State. The inevitable result of such a mode of manufacture was crude articles at high prices. To-day the world obtains commodities of excellent quality at prices which even the preceding generation would have deemed incredible. In the commercial world similar causes have produced similar results, and the race is benefited thereby. The poor enjoy what the rich could not before afford. What were the luxuries have become the necessaries of life. The laborer has now more comforts than the farmer had a few generations ago. The farmer has more luxuries than the landlord had, and is more richly clad and better housed. The landlord has books and pictures rarer and appointments more artistic than the king could then obtain. The price we pay for this salutary change is, no doubt, great. We assemble thousands of operatives in the factory, and in the mine, of whom the employer can know little or nothing, and to whom he is little better than a myth. All intercourse be tween them is at an end. Rigid castes are formed, and, as usual, mutual ignorance breeds mutual distrust. Each caste is without sympathy with the other, and ready to credit anything disparaging in regard to it. Under the law of competition, the employer of thousands is forced into the strictest economies, among which the rates paid to labor figure prominently, and often there is friction between the employer and the employed, between capital and labor, between rich and poor. Human society loses homogeneity. The price which society pays for the law of competition, like the price it pays for cheap comforts and luxuries, is also great","excerpt":"but the advantages of this law are also greater still than its cost-for it is to this law that we owe our wonderful material development, which brings improved conditions in its train. But, whether the law be benign or not, we must say of it, as we say of the change in the conditions of men to which we have referred: It is here; we cannot evade it; no substitutes for it have been found; and while the law may be sometimes hard for the individual, it is best for the race, because it insures the survival of the fittest in every department. We accept and welcome, there fore, as conditions to which we must accommodate ourselves, great inequality of environment; the concentration of business, industrial and commercial, in the hands of a few; and the law of compe tition between these, as being not only beneficial, but essential to the future progress of the race. Having accepted these, it follows that there must be great scope for the exercise of special ability in the merchant and in the manufacturer who has to conduct affairs upon a great scale. That this talent for organization and management is rare among men is proved by the fact that it invariably secures enormous rewards for its possessor, no matter where or under what laws or conditions. The experienced in affairs always rate the man whose services can be obtained as a partner as not only the first consideration, but such as render the question of his capital scarcely worth considering: for able men soon create capital; in the hands of those without the special talent required, capital soon takes wings. Such men become interested in firms or corporations using millions; and, estimating only simple interest to be made upon the capital invested, it is inevitable that their income must exceed their expenditure and that they must, there fore, accumulate wealth. Nor is there any middle ground which such men can occupy, because the great manufacturing or commercial concern which does not earn at least interest upon its capital soon becomes bankrupt. It must either go forward or fall behind; to stand still is impossible. It is a condition essential to its successful operation that it should be thus far profitable, and even that, in addition to interest on capital, it should make profit. It is a law, as certain as any of the others named, that men possessed of this peculiar talent for affairs, under the free play of economic forces must, of necessity, soon be in receipt of more revenue than can be judiciously expended upon them selves; and this law is as beneficial for the race as the others. Objections to the foundations upon which so ciety is based are not in order, because the condition of the race is better with these than it has been with any other which has been tried. Of the effect of any new substitutes proposed we cannot be sure. The Socialist or Anarchist who seeks to overturn present conditions is to be regarded as attacking the foundation upon which civilization itself rests, for civilization took its start from the day when the capable, industrious workman said to his incompetent and lazy fellow, \\"If thou cost not sow, thou shalt not reap,\\" and thus ended primitive Communism by separating the drones from the bees. One who studies this subject will soon be brought face to face with the conclusion that upon the sacredness of property civilization itself depends-the right of the laborer to his hundred dollars in the savings-bank, and equally the legal right of the millionaire to his millions. Every man must be allowed \\"to sit under his own vine and fig-tree, with none to make afraid,\\" if human society is to advance, or even to remain so far advanced as it is. To those who propose to substitute Communism for this intense Individualism, the answer therefore is: The race has tried that. All progress from that barbarous day to the present time has resulted from its displacement. Not evil, but good, has come to the race from the accumulation of wealth by those who have had the ability and energy to produce it. But even if we admit for a moment that it might be better for the race to discard its present foundation, Individualism,-that it is a nobler ideal that man should labor, not for himself alone, but in and for a brotherhood of his fellows, and share with them all in common, realizing Swedenborg's idea of heaven, where, as he says, the angels derive their happiness, not from laboring for self, but for each other, -even admit all this, and a sufficient answer is, This is not evolution, but revolution. It necessitates the changing of human nature itself-a work of eons, even if it were good to change it, which we cannot know. It is not practicable in our day or in our age. Even if desirable theoretically, it belongs to another and long-succeeding sociological stratum. Our duty is with what is practicable now-with the next step possible in our day and generation. It is criminal to waste our energies in endeavoring to uproot, when all we can profitably accomplish is to bend the universal tree of humanity a little in the direction most favorable to the production of good fruit under existing circumstances. We might as well urge the destruction of the highest existing type of man because he failed to reach our ideal as to favor the destruction of Individualism, Private Property, the Law of Aacumulation of Wealth, and the Law of Competition; for these are the high est result of human experience, the soil in which society, so far, has produced the best fruit. In equally or unjustly, perhaps, as these laws some times operate, and imperfect as they appear to the Idealist, they are, nevertheless, like the highest type of man, the best and most valuable of all that humanity has yet accomplished. We start, then, with a condition of affairs under which the best interests of the race are promoted, but which inevitably gives wealth to the few. Thus far, accepting conditions as they exist, the situation can be surveyed and pronounced good. Question then arises.-and if the foregoing be correct, it is the only question with which we have to deal,-What is the proper mode of administering wealth after the laws upon which civilization is founded have thrown it into the hands of the few.7 And it is of this great question that I believe I offer the true solution. It will be under stood that fortunes are here spoken of, not moderate sums saved by many years of effort, the returns from which are required for the comfortable maintenance and education of families. This is not wealth, but only competence, which it should be the aim of all to acquire, and which it is for the best interests of society should be acquired. There are but three modes in which surplus wealth can be disposed of. It can be left to the families of the decendents; or it can be bequeathed for public purposes; or, finally, it can be administered by its possessors during their lives. Under the first and second modes most of the wealth of the world that has reached the few has hitherto been applied. Let us in turn consider each of these modes. The first is the most injudicious. In monarchical countries, the estates and the greatest portion of the wealth are left to the first son, that the vanity of the parent may be gratified by the thought that his name and title are to descend unimpaired to succeeding generations. The condition of this class in Europe to-day teaches the failure of such hopes or ambitions. The successors have become impoverished through their follies, or from the fall in the value of land. Even in Great Britain the strict law of entail has been found inadequate to maintain an hereditary class. Its soil is rapidly passing into the hands of the stranger. Under republican institutions the division of property among the children is much fairer; but the question which forces itself upon thoughtful men in all lands is, Why should men leave great fortunes to their children. If this is done from affection, is it not misguided affection. Observation teaches that, generally speaking, it is not well for the children that they should be so burdened. Neither is it well for the State. Beyond providing for the wife and daughters moderate sources of income, and very moderate allowances indeed, if any, for the sons, men may well hesitate; for it is no longer questionable that great sums bequeathed often work more for the injury than for- the good of the recipients. Wise men will soon conclude that, for the best interests of the members of their families, and of the State, such bequests are an improper use of their means. It is not suggested that men who have failed to educate their sons to earn a livelihood shall cast them adrift in poverty. If any man has seen fit to rear his sons with a view to their living idle lives, or, what is highly commendable, has instilled in them the sentiment that they are in a position to labor for public ends without reference to pecuniary considerations, then, of course, the duty of the parent is to see that such are provided for in moderation. There are instances of millionaires' sons unspoiled by wealth, who, being rich, still perform great services to the community. Such are the very salt of the earth, as valuable as, unfortunately, they are rare. It is not the exception however, but the rule, that men must regard; and, looking at the usual result of enormous sums conferred upon legatees, the thoughtful man must shortly say, \\"I would as soon leave to my son a curse as the almighty dollar,\\" and admit to himself that it is not the welfare of the children, but family pride, which inspires these legacies. As to the second mode, that of leaving wealth at death for public uses, it may be said that this is only a means for the disposal of wealth, provided a man is content to wait until he is dead before he becomes of much good in the world. Knowledge of the results of legacies bequeathed is not calculated to inspire the brightest hopes of much posthumous good being accomplished by them. -The cases are not few in which the real object sought by the testator is not attained, nor are they few in which his real wishes are thwarted. In many cases the bequests are so used as to be come only monuments of his folly. It is well to remember that it requires the excercise of not less ability than that which acquires it, to use wealth so as to be really beneficial to the community Besides this, it may fairly be said that no man is to be extolled for doing what he cannot help doing, nor is he to be thanked by the community to which he only leaves wealth at death. Men who leave vast sums in this way may fairly be thought men who would not have left it at all had they been able to take it with them. The memories of such cannot be held in grateful remembrance,-for there is no grace in their gifts. It is not to be wondered at that such bequests seem so generally to lack the blessing. The growing disposition to tax more and more heavily large estates left at death is a cheering indication of the growth of a salutary change in public opinion. The State of Pennsylvania now takes-subject to some exceptions-one tenth of the property left by its citizens. The budget presented in the British Parliament the other day proposes to increase the death duties; and, most significant of all, the new tax is to be a graduated one. Of all forms of taxation this seems the wisest. Men who continue hoarding great sums all their lives, the proper use of which for public ends would work good to the community from which it chiefly came, should be made to feel that the community, in the form of the State, cannot thus be deprived of its proper share. By tax ing estates heavily at death the State marks its condemnation of the selfish millionaire's unworthy life. It is desirable that nations should go much further in this direction. Indeed, it is difficult to set bounds to the share of a rich man's estate which should go at his death to the public through the agency of the State, and by all means such taxes should be graduated, beginning at nothing upon moderate sums to dependents, and increasing rapidly as the amounts swell, until of the millionaire's hoard, as of Shylock's, at least The other half Comes to the privy coffer of theState.This policy would work powerfully to induce the rich man to attend to the administration of wealth during his life, which is the end that society should always have in view, as being by far the most fruitful for the people. Nor need it be feared that this policy would sap the root of enterprise and render men less anxious to accumulate, for, to the class whose ambition it is to leave great fortunes and be talked about after their death, it will attract even more attention, and, indeed, be a somewhat nobler ambition, to have enormous sums paid over to the State from their fortunes. There remains, then, only one mode of using great fortunes; but in this we have the true antidote for the temporary unequal distribution of wealth, the reconciliation of the rich and the poor -a reign of harmony, another ideal, differing, indeed, from that of the Communist in requiring only the further evolution of existing conditions, not the total overthrow of our civilization. It is founded upon the present most intense Individual ism, and the race is prepared to put it in practice by degrees whenever it pleases. Under its sway we shall have an ideal State, in which the surplus wealth of the few will become, in the best sense, the property of the many, because administered for the common good; and this wealth, passing through the hands of the few, can be made a much more potent force for the elevation of our race than if distributed in small sums to the people themselves. Even the poorest can be made to see this, and to agree that great sums gathered by some of their fellow-citizens and spent for public purposes, from which the masses reap the principal benefit, are more valuable to them than if scattered among themselves in trifling amounts through the course of many years. If we consider the results which flow from the Cooper Institute, for instance, to the best portion of the race in New York not possessed of means, and compare these with those which would have ensued for the good of the masses from an equal sum distributed by Mr. Cooper in his lifetime in the form of wages, which is the highest form of distribution, being for work done and not for charity, we can form some estimate of the possibilities for the improvement of the race which lie embedded in the present law of the accumulation of wealth. Much of this sum, if distributed in small quantities among the people, would have been wasted in the indulgence of appetite, some of it in excess, and it may be doubted whether even the part put to the best use, that of adding to the comforts of the home, would have yielded results for the race, as a race, at all comparable to those which are flowing and are to flow from the Cooper Institute from generation to generation. Let the advo cate of violent or radical change ponder well this thought. We might even go so far as to take another instance-that of Mr. Tilden's bequest of five millions of dollars for a free library in the city of New York; but in referring to this one cannot help saying involuntarily: How much better if Mr. Tilden had devoted the last years of his own life to the proper administration of this immense sum; in which case neither legal contest nor any other cause of delay could have interfered with his aims. But let us assume that Mr. Tilden's millions finally become the means of giving to this city a noble public library, where the treasures of the world contained in books will be open to all forever, without money and without price. Considering the good of that part of the race which congregates in and around Manhattan Island, would its permanent benefit have been better promoted had these millions been allowed to circulate in small sums through the hands of the masses! Even the most strenuous advocate of Communism must entertain a doubt upon this subject. Most of those who think will probably entertain no doubt what ever. Poor and restricted are our opportunities in this life, narrow our horizon, our best work most imperfect; but rich men should be thankful for one inestimable boon. They have it in their power during their lives to busy themselves in organizing benefactions from which the masses of their fellows will derive lasting advantage, and thus dignify their own lives. The highest life is probably to be reached, not by such imitation of the life of Christ as Count Tolstoi gives us, but, while animated by Christ's spirit, by recognizing the changed conditions of this age, and adopting modes of expressing this spirit suitable to the changed conditions under which we live, still laboring for the good of our fellows, which was the essence of his life and teaching, but laboring in a different manner. This, then, is held to be the duty of the man of wealth: To set an example of modest, unostentatious living, shunning display or extravagance; to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him; and, after doing so, to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds, which he is called upon to administer, and strictly bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which, in his judgment, is best calculated to produce the most beneficial results for the community-the man of wealth thus becoming the mere trustee and agent for his poorer brethren, bringing to their service his superior wisdom, experience, and ability to administer, doing for them better than_ they would or could do for themselves. We are met here with the difficulty of determining what are moderate sums to leave to mem bers of the family; what is modest, unostentatious living; what is the test of extravagance. There must be different standards for different conditions. The answer is that it is as impossible to name exact amounts or actions as it is to define good manners, good taste, or the rules of propriety; but, nevertheless, these are verities, well known, although indefinable. Public sentiment is quick to know and to feel what offends these. So in the case of wealth. The rule in regard to good taste in the dress of men or women applies here. Whatever makes one conspicuous offends the canon. If any family be chiefly known for display, for extravagance in home, table, or equipage, for enormous sums ostentatiously spent in any form upon itself-if these be its chief distinctions, we have no difficulty in estimating its nature or culture. So likewise in regard to the use or abuse of its surplus wealth, or to generous, free handed cooperation in good public uses, or to unabated efforts to accumulate and hoard to the last, or whether they administer or bequeath. The verdict rests with the best and most enlightened public sentiment. The community will surely judge, and its judgments will not often be wrong. The best uses to which surplus wealth can be put have already been indicated. Those who would administer wisely must, indeed, be wise; for one of the serious obstacles to the improve ment of our race is indiscriminate charity. It were better for mankind that the millions of the rich were thrown into the sea than so spent as to encourage the slothful, the drunken, the unworthy. Of every thousand dollars spent in so-called charity to-day, it is probable that nine hundred and fifty dollars is unwisely spent-so spent, indeed, as to produce the very evils which it hopes to mitigate or cure. A well-known writer of philosophic books admitted the other day that he had given a quarter of a dollar to a man who approached him as he was coming to visit the house of his friend. He knew nothing of the habits of this beggar, knew not the use that would be made of this money, although he had every reason to suspect that it would be spent improperly. This man professed to be a disciple of Herbert Spencer; yet the quarter-dollar given that night will probably work more injury than all the money will do good which its thought less donor will ever be able to give in true charity. He only gratified his own feelings, saved himself from annoyance-and this was probably one of the most selfish and very worst actions of his life, for in all respects he is most worthy. In bestowing charity, the main consideration: should be to help those who will help themselves; to provide part of the means by which those who desire to improve may do so; to give those who desire to rise the aids by which they may rise; to assist, but rarely or never to do all. Neither the individual nor the race is improved by almsgiving. Those worthy of assistance, except in rare cases, seldom require assistance. The really valuable men of the race never do, except in case of accident or sudden change. Every one has, of course, cases of individuals brought to his own knowledge where temporary assistance can do genuine good, and these he will not overlook. But the amount which can be wisely given by the individual for individuals is necessarily limited by his lack of knowledge of the circumstances connected with each. He is the only true reformer who is as care ful and as anxious not to aid the unworthy as he is to aid the worthy, and, perhaps, even more so, for in almsgiving more injury is probably done by rewarding vice than by relieving virtue. The rich man is thus almost restricted to follow ing the examples of Peter Cooper, Enoch Pratt of Baltimore, Mr. Pratt of Brooklyn, Senator Stanford, and others, who know that the best means of benefiting the community is to place within its reach the ladders upon which the aspiring can rise-free libraries, parks, and means of recreation, by which men are helped in body and mind; works of art, certain to give pleasure and improve the public taste; and public institutions of various kinds, which will improve the general condition of the people; in this manner returning their surplus wealth to the mass of their fellows in the forms best calculated to do them lasting good. Thus is the problem of rich and poor to be solved. The laws of accumulation will be left free, the laws of distribution free. Individualism will continue, but the millionaire will be but a trustee for the poor, intrusted for a season with a great part of the increased wealth of the community, but administering it for the community far better than it could or would have done for itself. The best minds will thus have reached a stage in the development of the race in which it is clearly seen that there is no mode of disposing of surplus wealth creditable to thoughtful and earnest men into whose hands it cows, save by using it year by year for the general good. This day already dawns. Men may die without incurring the pity of their fellows, still sharers in great business enterprises from which their capital cannot be or has not been withdrawn, and which is left chiefly at death for public uses; yet the day is not far distant when the man who dies leaving behind him millions of available wealth, which was free for him to administer during life, will pass away \\"unwept, unhonored, and unsung,\\" no matter to what uses he leaves the dross which he cannot take with him. Of such as these the public verdict will then be: \\" The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\\" Such, in my opinion, is the true gospel concern ing wealth, obedience to which is destined some day to solve the problem of the rich and the poor, and to bring \\"Peace on earth, among men good will.\\" II THE BEST FIELDS FOR PHILANTHROPY WHILE \\" The Gospel of Wealth\\" has met a cordial reception upon this side of the Atlantic, it is natural that in the motherland it should have attracted more attention, because the older civilization is at present brought more clearly face to face with socialistic questions. The contrast between the classes and the masses, between rich and poor, is not yet quite so sharp in this vast, fertile, and developing continent, with less than twenty persons per square mile, as in crowded little Britain, with fifteen times that number and no territory unoccupied. Perhaps the \\"Pall Mall Gazette\\" in its issue of September 5 puts most pithily the objections that have been raised to what the English have been pleased to call \\"The Gospel of Wealth.\\" 1 I quote: \\" Great fortunes, says Mr. Carnegie, are great blessings to a community, because such and such things may be done with them. Well, but they are also a great curse, for such and such things are done with them. Mr. Carnegie's preaching, in other words, is altogether vitiated by Mr. Benzon's practice. The gospel of wealth is killed by the acts.\\" To this the reply seems obvious: the gospel of Christianity is also killed by the acts. The same objection that is urged against the gospel of wealth lies against the commandment, \\"Thou shalt not steal.\\" It is no argument against a gospel that it is not lived up to ,indeed it is an argument in its favor, for a gospel must be higher than the prevailing standard. It is no argument against a law that it is broken: in that disobedience lies the reason for making and maintaining the law; the law which is never to be broken is never required. Undoubtedly the most notable incident in regard to \\" The Gospel of Wealth \\" is that it was fortunate enough to attract the attention of Mr. Gladstone, and bring forth the following note from him: \\"I have asked Mr. Lloyd Bryce [\\"North American Review\\"] kindly to allow the republication in this l this article appeared originally under the title \\"Wealth.\\" country of the extremely interesting article on 'Wealth,' by Mr. Andrew Carnegie, which has just appeared in America.\\" This resulted in the publication of the article in several newspapers and periodicals, and an enterprising publisher issued it in pamphlet form, dedicated by permission to Mr. Gladstone. All this is most encouraging, proving as it does that society is alive to the great issue involved, and is in a receptive mood. Your request, Mr. Editor, that I should continue the subject and point out the best fields for the use of surplus wealth, may be taken as further proof that whether the ideas promulgated are to be received or rejected, they are at least certain to obtain a hearing. The first article held that there is but one right mode of using enormous fortunes-namely, that the possessors from time to time during their own lives should so administer these as to promote the permanent good to the communities from which they were gathered. It was held that public sentiment would soon say of one who died possessed of available wealth which he was free to administer: \\" The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\\" The purpose of this paper is to present some of the best methods of performing this duty of administering surplus wealth for the good of the people. The first requisite for a really good use of wealth by the millionaire who has accepted the gospel which proclaims him only a trustee of the surplus that comes to him, is to take care that the purposes for which he spends it shall not have a degrading pauperizing tendency upon its recipients, but that his trust shall be so administered as to stimulate the best and most aspiring poor of the community to further efforts for their own improvement. It is not the irreclaimably destitute, shiftless, and worthless which it is truly beneficial or truly benevolent for the individual to attempt to reach and improve. For these there exists the refuge provided by the city or the State, where they can be sheltered, fed, clothed, and kept in comfortable existence, and-most important of all-where they can be isolated from the well-doing and industrious poor, who are liable to be demoralized by contact with these unfortunates. One man or woman who succeeds in living comfortably by begging is more dangerous to society, and a greater obstacle to the progress of humanity, than a score of wordy Socialists. The individual administrator of surplus wealth has as his charge the industrious and ambitious; not those who need everything done for them, but those who, being most anxious and able to help themselves, deserve and will be benefited by help from others and by the extension of their opportunies by the aid of the philanthropic rich. It is ever to be remembered that one of the chief obstacles which the philanthropist meets in his efforts to do real and permanent good in this world, is the practice of indiscriminate giving and the duty of the millionaire is to resolve to cease giving to objects that are not clearly proved to his satisfaction to be deserving. He must remember Mr. Rice's belief, that nine hundred and fifty out of every thousand dollars bestowed to-day upon so-called charity had better be thrown into the sea. As far as my experience of the wealthy extends, it is unnecessary to urge them to give of their superabundance in charity so called. Greater good for the race is to be achieved by inducing them to cease impulsive and injurious giving. As a rule, the sins of millionaires in this respect are not those of omission, but of commission, because they do not take time to think, and chiefly because it is much easier to give than to refuse. Those who have surplus wealth give millions every year which produce more evil than good, and really retard the progress of the people, because most of the forms in vogue to-day for benefiting mankind only tend to spread among the poor a spirit of dependence upon alms, when what is essential for progress is that they should be inspired to depend upon their own exertions. The miser millionaire who hoards his wealth does less injury to society than the careless millionaire who squanders his unwisely, even if he does so under cover of the mantle of sacred charity. The man who gives to the individual beggar commits a grave offense, but there are many societies and institutions soliciting alms, to aid which is none the less injurious to the community. These are as corrupting as individual beggars Plutarch's \\"Morals\\" contains this lesson: \\" A beggar asking an alms of a Lacedaemo- nian, he said:--'-Well, should I give thee anything, thou wilt be the greater beggar, for he that first gave thee money made thee idle, and is the cause of this base and dishonorable way of living.' As I know them, there are few millionaires, very few indeed, who are clear of the sin of having made beggars. Bearing in mind these considerations, let us endeavor to present some of the best uses to which a millionaire can devote the surplus of which he should regard himself as only the trustee. First. Standing apart by itself there is the founding of a university by men enormously rich, such men as must necessarily be few in any country. Perhaps the greatest sum ever given by an individual for any purpose is the gift of Senator Stanford, who undertakes to establish a complete university upon the Pacific coast, where he amassed his enormous fortune, which is said to involve the expenditure of ten millions of dollars, and upon which he may be expected to bestow twenty millions of his surplus. He is to be envied. A thousand years hence some orator, speaking his praise upon the then crowded shores of the Pacific, may thus adapt Griffith's eulogy of Wolsey: Inbestowing, madam, He was most princely. Ever witness for him This seat of learning, . . . though unfinished, yetso famous, So excellent in art, and still so rising, That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue. Here is a noble use of wealth. We have many such institutions,-Johns Hopkins, Cornell, Packer, and others,-but most of these have only been bequeathed, and it is impossible to extol any man greatly for simply leaving what he cannot take with him. Cooper and Pratt and Stanford, and others of this class, deserve credit and admiration as much for the time and attention given during their lives as for their expenditure upon their respective monuments. We cannot think of the Pacific coast without recalling another important work of a different character which has recently been established there -the Lick Observatory. If any millionaire be interested in the ennobling study of astronomy,-and there should be and would be such if they but gave the subject the slightest attention,-here is an example which could well be followed, for the progress made in astronomical instruments and appliances is so great and continuous that every few years a new telescope might be judiciously given to one of the observatories upon this continent, the last being always the largest and the best, and certain to carry further and further the knowledge of the universe and of our relation to it here upon the earth. As one among many of the good deeds of the late Mr. Thaw of Pittsburg, his constant support of the observatory there may be mentioned. This observatory enabled Professor Langley to make his wonderful discoveries. He is now at the head of the Smithsonian Institution, a worthy successor to Professor Henry. Connected with him was Mr. Braeshier of Pittsburg, whose instruments are in most of the principal observatories of the world. He was a common millwright but Mr. Thaw recognized his genius and was his main support through trying days. This common workman has been made a professor by one of the foremost scientific bodies of the world. In applying part of his surplus in aiding these two now famous men, the millionaire Thaw did a noble work. Their joint labors have brought great credit, and are destined to bring still greater credit, upon their country in every scientific center throughout the world. It is reserved for very few to found universities, and, indeed, the use for many, or perhaps any, new universities does not exist. More good is henceforth to be accomplished by adding to and extend- ing those in existence. But in this department a wide field remains for the millionaire as distinguished from the Craesus among millionaires. The gifts to Yale University have been many, but there is plenty of room for others. The School of Fine Arts, founded by Mr. Street, the Sheffield Scientific School, endowed by Mr. Sheffield, and Professor Loomis's fund for the observatory, are fine examples. Mrs. C. J. Osborne's building for reading and recitation is to be regarded with especial pleasure as being the wise gift of a woman. Harvard University has not been forgotten; the Peabody Museum and the halls of Wells, Matthews, and Thayer may be cited. Sever Hall is worthy of special mention, as showing what a genius like Richardson could do with the small sum of a hundred thousand dollars. The Vanderbilt University, at Nashville, Tennessee, may be mentioned as a true product of the gospel of wealth. It was established by the members of the Vanderbilt family during their lives-mark this vital feature, during their lives; for nothing counts for much that is left by a man at his death. Such funds are torn from him, not given by him. If any millionaire be at a loss to know how to accomplish great and indisputable good with his surplus, here is a field which can never be fully occupied, for the wants of our universities increase with the development of the country. Second. The result of my own study of the question, What is the best gift which can be given to a community? is that a free library occupies the first place, provided the community will accept and maintain it as a public institution, as much a part of the city property as its public schools, and, indeed, an adjunct to these. It is, no doubt, possible that my own personal experience may have led me to value a free library beyond all other forms of beneficence. When I was a working-boy in Pittsburg, Colonel Anderson of Allegheny-a name I can never speak without feelings of devotional gratitude-opened his little library of four hundred books to boys. Every Saturday afternoon he was in attendance at his house to exchange books. No one but he who has felt it can ever know the intense longing with which the arrival of Saturday was awaited, that a new book might be had. My brother and Mr. Phipps, who have been my principal business partners through life, shared with me Colonel Anderson's precious generosity, and it was when reveling in the treasures which he opened to us that I resolved, if ever wealth came to me, that it should be used to establish free libraries, that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to that noble man. Great Britain has been foremost in appreciating the value of free libraries for its people. Parliament passed an act permitting towns and cities to establish and maintain these as municipal institutions; whenever the people of any town or city voted to aacept the provisions of the act, the authorities were authorized to tax the community to the extent of one penny in the pound valuation Most of the towns already have free libraries under this act. Many of these are the gifts of rich men, whose funds have been used for the building, and in some cases for the books also, the communities being required to maintain and to develop the libraries. And to this feature I attribute most of their usefulness. An endowed institution is liable to become the prey of a clique. The public ceases to take interest in it, or, rather, never acquires interest in it. The rule has been violated which requires the recipients to help themselves. Everything has been done for the community instead of its being only helped to help itself, and good results rarely ensue. Many free libraries have been established in our country, but none that I know of with such wisdom as the Pratt Library in Baltimore. Mr. Pratt built and presented the library to the city of Baltimore, with the balance of cash handed over; the total cost was one million dollars, upon which he required the city to pay five per cent. per annum, fifty thousand dollars per year, to trustees for the maintenance and development of the library and its branches. During 1888 430,217 books were distributed; 37,196 people of Baltimore are registered upon the books as readers. And it is safe to say that 37,000 frequenters of the Pratt Library are of more value to Baltimore, to the State, and to the country, than all the inert, lazy, and hopelessly poor in the whole nation. And it may further be safely said that, by placing books within the reach of 37,000 aspiring people which they were anxious to obtain, Mr. Pratt has done more for the genuine progress of the people than has been done by all the contributions of all the millionaires and rich people to help those who cannot or will not help themselves. The one wise administrator of his surplus has poured a fertilizing stream upon so,1 that was ready to receive it and return a hundredfold. The many squanderers have not only poured their streams into sieves which can never be filled-they have done worse: they have poured them into stagnant sewers that breed the diseases which most afflict the body politic. And this is not all. The million dollars of which Mr. Pratt has made so grand a use are something, but there is something greater still. When the fifth branch library was opened in Baltimore, the speaker said: Whatever may have been done in these four years, it is my pleasure to acknowledge that much, very much, is due to the earnest interest, the wise counsels, and the practical suggestions of Mr. Pratt. He never seemed to feel that the mere donation of great wealth for the benefit of his fellow-citizens was all that would be asked of him, but he wisely labored to make its application as comprehensive and effective as possible. Thus he constantly lightened burdens that were, at times, very heavy, brought good cheer and bright sunshine when clouds flitted across the sky, and made every officer and employee feel that good work was appreciated, and loyal dovotion to duty would receive hearty commendation. This is the finest picture I have ever seen of any of the millionaire class. As here depicted, Mr. Pratt is the ideal disciple of the gospel of wealth. We need have no fear that the mass of toilers will fail to recognize in such as he their best leaders and their most invaluable allies; for the problem of poverty and wealth, of employer and employed, will be practically solved whenever the time of the few is given, and their wealth is administered during their lives, for the best good of that portion of the community which has not been burdened with the responsibilities which attend the possession of wealth. We shall have no antagonism between classes when that day comes, for the high and the low, the rich and the poor, shall then indeed be brothers. No millionaire will go far wrong in his search for one of the best forms for the use of his surplus who chooses to establish a free library in any community that is willing to maintain and develop it. John Bright's words should ring in his ear: \\" It is impossible for any man to bestow a greater benefit upon a young man than to give him access to books in a free library.\\" Closely allied to the library, and, where possible, attached to it, there should be rooms for an art-gallery and museum, and a hall for such lectures and instruction as are provided in the Cooper Union. The traveler upon the Continent is surprised to find that every town of importance has its art-gallery and museum; these may be large or small, but each has a receptacle for the treasures of the locality, in which are constantly being placed valuable gifts and bequests. The Free Library and Art Gallery of Birmingham are remarkable among such institutions, and every now and then a rich man adds to their value by presenting books, fine pictures, or other works of art. All that our cities require, to begin with, is a proper fire-proof building. Their citizens who travel will send to it rare and costly things from every quarter of the globe they visit, while those who remain at home will give or bequeath to it of their treasures. In this way collections will grow until our cities will ultimately be able to boast of permanent exhibitions from which their own citizens will derive incalculable benefit, and which they will be proud to show to visitors. In the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York we have made an excellent beginning. Here is another avenue for the proper use of surplus wealth. Third. We have another most important department in which great sums can be worthily used-the founding or extension of hospitals, medical colleges, laboratories, and other institutions connected with the alleviation of human suffering, and especially with the prevention rather than with the cure of human ills. There is no danger in pauperizing a community in giving for such purposes, because such institutions relieve temporary ailments or shelter only those who are hopeless invalids. What better gift than a hospital can be given to a community that is without one -the gift being conditioned upon its proper maintenance by the community in its corporate capacity. If hospital accommodation already exists, no better method for using surplus wealth can be found than in making additions to it. The late Mr. Vanderbilt's gift of half a million dollars to the Medical Department of Columbia College for a chemical laboratory was one of the wisest possible uses of wealth. It strikes at the prevention of disease by penetrating into its causes. Several others have established such laboratories, but the need for them is still great. If there be a millionaire in the land who is at a loss what to do with the surplus that has been committed to him as trustee, let him investigate the good that is flowing from these chemical laboratories. No medical college is complete without its laboratory. As with universities, so with medical colleges: it is not new institutions that are required, but additional means for the more thorough equipment of those that exist. The forms that benefactions to these may wisely take are numerous, but probably none is more useful than that adopted by Mr. Osborne when he built a school for training female nurses at Bellevue College. If from all gifts there flows one half of the good that comes from this wise use of a millionaire's surplus, the most exacting may well be satisfied. Only those who have passed through a lingering and dangerous illness can rate at their true value the care, skill, and attendance of trained female nurses. Their employment as nurses has enlarged the sphere and influence of woman. It is not to be wondered at that a senator of the United States, and a physician distinguished in this country for having received the highest distinctions abroad, should recently have found their wives in this class. Fourth. In the very front rank of benefactions public parks should be placed, always provided that the community undertakes to maintain, beautify, and preserve them inviolate. No more useful or more beautiful monument can be left by any man than a park for the city in which he was born or in which he has long lived, nor can the community pay a more graceful tribute to the citizen who presents it than to give his name to the gift. Mrs. Schenley's gift last month of a large park to the city of Pittsburg deserves to be noted. This lady, although born in Pittsburg, married an English gentleman while yet in her teens. It is forty years and more since she took up her residence in London among the titled and the wealthy of the world's metropolis, but still she turns to the home of her childhood and by means of Schenley Park links her name with it forever. A noble use this of great wealth by one who thus becomes her own administrator. If a park be already provided, there is still room for many judicious gifts in connection with it. Mr. Phipps of Allegheny has given conservatories to the park there, which are visited by many every day of the week, and crowded by thousands of working-people every Sunday for, with rare wisdom, he has stipulated as a condition of the gift that the conservatories shall be open on Sundays. The result of his experiment has been so gratifying that he finds himself justified in adding to them from his surplus, as he is doing largely this year. To lovers of flowers among the wealthy I commend a study of what is possible for them to do in the line of Mr. Phipps's example; and may they please note that Mr. Phipps is a wise as well as a liberal giver, for he requires the city to maintain these conservatories, and thus secures for them forever the public ownership, the public interest, and the public criticism of their management. Had he undertaken to manage and maintain them, it is probable that popular interest in the gift would never have been awakened. The parks and pleasure-grounds of small towns throughout Europe are not less surprising than their libraries, museums, and art-galleries. I saw nothing more pleasing during my recent travels than the hill at Bergen, in Norway. It has been converted into one of the most picturesque of pleasure-grounds; fountains, cascades, waterfalls, delightful arbors, fine terraces, and statues adorn what was before a barren mountain-side. Here is a field worthy of study by the millionaire who would confer a lasting benefit upon his fellows. Another beautiful instance of the right use of wealth in the direction of making cities more and more attractive is to be found in Dresden. The owner of the leading paper there bequeathed its revenues forever to the city, to be used in beautifying it. An art committee decides, from time to time, what new artistio feature is to be introduced, or what hideous feature is to be changed, and as the revenues accrue, they are expended in this direction. Thus, through the gift of this patriotic newspaper proprietor his native city of Dresden is fast becoming one of the most artistic places of residence in the whole world. A work having been completed, it devolves upon the city to maintain it forever. May I be excused if I commend to our millionaire newspaper proprietors the example of their colleague in the capital of Saxony. Scarcely a city of any magnitude in the older countries is without many structures and features of great beauty. Much has been spent upon ornament, decoration, and architectural effect. We are still far behind in these things upon this side of the Atlantic. Our Republic is great in some things-in material development unrivaled; but let us always remember that in art and in the finer touches we have scarcely yet taken a place. Had the exquisite Memorial Arch recently erected temporarily in New York been shown in Dresden, the art committee there would probably have been enabled, from the revenue of the newspaper given by its owner for just such purposes, to order its permanent erection to adorn the city forever.1 While the bestowal of a park upon a community will be universally approved as one of the best uses for surplus wealth, in embracing such additions to it as conservatories, or in advocating the building of memorial arches and works of adornment, it is probable that many will think I go too far, and consider these somewhat fanciful. The material good to flow from them may not be so directly visible; but let not any practical mind, intent only upon material good, depreciate the value of wealth given for these or for kindred esthetic purposes as being useless as far as the mass of the people and their needs are concerned. As with libraries and museums, so with these more distinctively artistic works: they perform their greatest when they reach the best of the masses of the people. It is better to reach and touch the sentiment for beauty in the naturally bright minds of this class than to pander to those incapable of being so touched. For what the improver of the race must endeavor is to reach those who have the divine spark ever so feebly developed, that it may be strengthened and grow. I Popular subscriptions have Monument), and two other me- accompliahed this result in the morial arches have been designed case referred to (the Washington and are to be erected here.-ED For my part, I think Mr. Phipps put his money to better use in giving the working-men of Allegheny conservatories filled with beautiful flowers, orchids, and aquatic plants, which they, with their wives and children, can enjoy in their spare hours, and upon which they can feed their love for the beautiful, than if he had given his surplus money to furnish them with bread; for those in health who cannot earn their bread are scarcely worth considering by the individual giver, the care of such being the duty of the State. The man who erects in a city a conservatory or a truly artistia arch, statue, or fountain, makes a wise use of his surplus. \\" Man does not live by bread alone.\\" Fifth. We have another good use for surplus wealth in providing our cities with halls suitable for meetings of all kinds, and for concerts of elevating music. Our cities are rarely possessed of halls for these purposes, being in this respect also very far behind European cities. Springer Hall, in Cincinnati, a valuable addition to the city, was largely the gift of Mr. Springer, who was not content to bequeath funds from his estate at death, but gave during his life, and, in addition, gave- what was equally important-his time and business ability to insure the successful results which have been achieved. The gift of a hall to any city lacking one is an excellent use for surplus wealth for the good of a community. The reason why the people have only one instructive and elevating, or even amusing, entertainment when a dozen would be highly beneficial, is that the rent of a hall, even when a suitable hall exists, which is rare, is so great as to prevent managers from running the risk of financial failure. If every city in our land owned a hall which could be given or rented for a small sum for such gatherings as a committee or the mayor of the city judged advantageous, the people could be furnished with proper lectures, amusements, and concerts at an exceedingly small cost. The town halls of European cities, many of which have organs, are of inestimable value to the people, utilized as they are in the manner suggested. Let no one underrate the influence of entertainments of an elevating or even of an amusing character, for these do much to make the lives of the people happier and their natures better. If any millionaire born in a small village which has now become a great city is prompted in the day of his success to do something for his birthplace with part of his surplus, his grateful remembrance cannot take a form more useful than that of a public hall with an organ, provided the city agrees to maintain and use it. Sixth. In another respect we are still much behind Europe. A form of beneficence which is not uncommon there is providing swimming-baths for the people. The donors of these have been wise enough to require the city benefited to maintain them at its own expense, and as proof of the contention that everything should never be done for any one or for any community, but that the recipients should invariably be called upon to do a part, it is significant that it is found essential for the popular success of these healthful establishments to exact a nominal charge for their use. In many cities, however, the school-children are admitted free at fixed hours upon certain days; different hours being fixed for the boys and the girls to use the great swimming-baths, hours or days being also fixed for the use of these baths by women. In addition to the highly beneficial effect of these institutions upon the public health in inland cities, the young of both sexes are thus taught to swim. Swimming clubs are organized, and matches are frequent, at which medals and prizes are given. The reports published by the various swimming- bath establishments throughout Great Britain are filled with instances of lives saved because those who fortunately escaped shipwreck had been taught to swim in the baths; and not a few instances are given in which the pupils of certain bathing establishments have saved the lives of others. If any disciple of the gospel of wealth gives his favorite city large swimming and private baths, provided the municipality undertakes their management as a city affair, he will never be called to account for an improper use of the funds intrusted to him. Seventh. Churches as fields for the use of surplus wealth have purposely been reserved until the last, because, these being sectarian, every man will be governed in his action in regard to them by his own attachments; therefore gifts to churches, it may be said, are not, in one sense, gifts to the community at large, but to special classes. Nevertheless every millionaire may know of a district where the little cheap, uncomfortable, and altogether unworthy wooden structure stands at the cross-roads, in which the whole neighborhood gathers on Sunday, and which, independently of the form of the doctrines taught, is the center of social life and source of neighborly feeling. The administrator of wealth makes a good use of a part of his surplus if he replaces that building with a permanent structure of brick, stone, or granite, up whose sides the honeysuckle and columbine may climb, and from whose tower the sweet-tolling bell may sound. The millionaire should not figure how cheaply this structure can be built, but how perfect it can be made. If he has the money, it should be made a gem, for the educating influence of a pure and noble specimen of architecture, built, as the pyramids were built, to stand for ages, is not to be measured by dollars. Every farmer's home, heart and mind in the district will be influenced by the beauty and grandeur of the church; and many a bright boy, gazing enraptured upon its richly colored windows and entranced by the celestial voice of the organ, will there receive his first message from and in spirit be carried away to the beautiful and enchanting realm which lies far from the material and prosaic conditions which surround him in this workaday world-a real world, this new realm, vague and undefined though its boundaries be. Once within its magic circle, its denizens live there an inner life more precious than the external, and all their days and all their ways, their triumphs and their trials, and all they see, and all they hear, and all they think, and all they do, are hallowed by the radiance which shines from afar upon this inner life, glorifying everything, and keeping all right within. But having given the building, the donor should stop there; the support of the church should be upon its own people. There is not much genuine religion in the congregation or much good to come from the church which is not supported at home. Many other avenues for the wise expenditure of surplus wealth might be indicated. I enumerate but a few-a very few-of the many fields which are open, and only those in which great or considerable sums can be judiciously used. It is not the privilege, however, of millionaires alone to work for or aid measures which are certain to benefit the community. Every one who has but a small surplus above his moderate wants may share this privilege with his richer brothers, and those without surplus can give at least a part of their time, which is usually as important as funds, and often more so. It is not expected, neither is it desirable, that there should be general concurrence as to the best possible use of surplus wealth. For different men and different localities there are different uses. What commends itself most highly to the judgment of the administrator is the best use for him, for his heart should be in the work. It is as important in administering wealth as it is in any other branch of a man's work that he should be enthusiastically devoted to it and feel that in the field selected his work lies. Besides this, there is room and need for all kinds of wise benefactions for the common weal. The man who builds a university, library, or laboratory performs no more useful work than he who elects to devote himself and his surplus means to the adornment of a park, the gathering together of a collection of pictures for the public, or the building of a memorial arch. These are all true laborers in the vineyard. The only point required by the gospel of wealth is that the surplus which accrues from time to time in the hands of a man should be administered by him in his own lifetime for that purpose which is seen by him, as trustee, to be best for the good of the people. To leave at death what he cannot take away, and place upon others the burden of the work which it was his own duty to perform, is to do nothing worthy. This requires no sacrifice, nor any sense of duty to his fellows. Time was when the words concerning the rich man entering the kingdom of heaven were regarded as a hard saying. To-day, when all questions are probed to the bottom and the standards of faith receive the most liberal interpretations the startling verse has been relegated to the rear to await the next kindly revision as one of those things which cannot be quite understood, but which, meanwhile, it is carefully to be noted, are not to be understood literally. But is it so very improbable that the next stage of thought is to restore the doctrine in all its pristine purity and force, as being in perfect harmony with sound ideas upon the subject of wealth and poverty, the rich and the poor, and the contrasts everywhere seen and deplored? In Christ's day, it is evident, reformers were against the wealthy. It is none the less evident that we are fast recurring to that position to-day; and there will be nothing to surprise the student of sociological development if society should soon approve the text which has caused so much anxiety: \\" It is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.\\" Even if the needle were the small casement at the gates, the words betoken serious difficulty for the rich. It will be but a step for the theologian from the doctrine that he who dies rich dies disgraced, to that which brings upon the man punishment or deprivation hereafter. The gospel of wealth but echoes Christ's words. It calls upon the millionaire to sell all that he hath and give it in the highest and best form to the poor by ad~ninistering his estate himself for the good of his fellows, before he is called upon to lie down and rest upon the bosom of Mother Earth. So doing, he will approach his end no longer the ignoble hoarder of useless millions; poor, very poor indeed, in money, but rich, very rich, twenty times a millionaire still, in the affection, gratitude, and admiration of his fellow-men, and- sweeter far-soothed and sustained by the still, small voice within, which, whispering, tells him that, because he has lived, perhaps one small part of the great world has been bettered just a little. This much is sure: against such riches as these no bar will be found at the gates of Paradise.

In Pittsfield in the 1860's, there lived the Good Widow Honicutt, a genteel if impoverished lady who survived per-page as scrivener-secretary to the local literati. The widow asked her best customers, a certain Mr. Hawthorne (statuesque if gloomy, shown center) and a Mr. Melville (left) to please stand as godpoppas for the two daughters Honicutt. Each writer, contorted, inward, accepted -- longing for citizenship, avid to seem nearly Pittsfield-normal. It was not to be.   Isabel, 11, a guitar prodigy, lavish of tress, melancholic and sigh-prone, became Hawthorne's godchild and favorite. Her one vice: savage nail-biting. Note how (pictured center) Isabel has managed to hide said nails? Melville's charge, knobby freckled Lucy, 7, far right (glowering, hands fisted as usual), is shown tearing up a Melville manuscript, one just copied at three cents a page by a bedraggled Momma. Note how Lucy has also ripped away her own sleeve's flounce (her right, your left). Let the history of Christmas show, no Berkshire child ever owned a chimney stocking so blackened by annual coal.

Locals said, \\"Pittsfield most fears Melville and Hawthorne, who quake only around li'l Lucy Honicutt.\\" If the brat adored her sole gentlemen callers, they -- unified by their religious sense of human evil -- made a cult of Lucy. \\"Only encourages,\\" Mrs. Honicutt quietly confessed. Lucy of the pit-bull gaze remained mute but for a single sentence, one oft-shrieked at mealtime and during spotty toilet training: \\"Me no want DO!\\" (Check above, and be damn sure she's just said it.) Melville proclaimed her \\"the Mischievous gone centrifugal, an American practical joke spun baroque, 'No-no' spelt in thunder.\\" \\"Oh dear,\\" the harassed mother bit her lip. Melville's journals evince a vertiginous fascination with Lucy's worsening misdeeds: Born a bed-wetter, she made herself a thief and shin-denter, Pittsfield's problem biter. Lucy tossed lit firecrackers into the open coffin at a bishop's funeral! Before the term \\"hyper-active,\\" she was chastely known as \\"outward.\\"   Of a warm Saturday, our two leading local fabulists loved wandering the bosky sundry dells alongside their lisping wards. They ventured far off any beaten nature path to where the wild things grow. (It is said that all four then took to the bushes and \\"played Indians,\\" whatever that means!) Rumors naturally abounded. Hawthorne, hand in hand with his convivial muse, Isabel, spoke seldom but effectively. He laughed only when no one else did, a night-kitchen of a laugh that, if luxuriant and baritone, always scared the horses. Melville -- a genial weather vane metering stark mood swings -- remained either eye-of-hurricane silent or luffed into angelic playfulness. He displayed but two affectations, his filthy personal laundry (mercifully obscured by beard) and a hatchet-shaped pipe acquired from worshipful islanders during his floating youth.   Widow Honicutt warned Lucy she would drive away her beloved guests","excerpt":"but the child's every famous misdeed silenced both gents to further respect, glummer recognitions. \\"End up . . . madhouse!\\" the mutterish widow said. Melville soon adapted Lucy's \\"Me no want DO!\\" He upgraded it to a more grammatical but just as richly hateful/useful \\"I would prefer not to.\\" Above see Lucy's Yuletide tantrum. She is hinting at displeasure over Uncle Herm's having given her not the requested horehound but a scrimshaw trinket she's just swallowed. Lucy then saw fit to run abroad, scattering godpoppa's new book (travel writing) all across Pittsfield proper. Chapter 11, which she clutches parts of, was later found secreted (for reasons all her own) in the brat's very bloomers. Melville jovially threatens her with his Pacific pipe. Isabel, cheek on fist, huffs, bored with plain Lucy's always getting everyone's attention. And Hawthorne, seeming all but fused against fair Isabel, appears even more than usually guilty of something. (Where, the modern mind might ask, is this immortal genius's left hand? Check it out.) And yet, having just lost an 11th of his new book, Melville somehow formulates an article of faith. \\"If your Isabel, Nathaniel, replicates all we love about our present parlorish century, perhaps my Lucy here hints at the best and worst of the next? I feel for her -- OH, to have been so bad so soon -- but I fear what she shows of the future. I foresee the reign of impulse and rank appetite, amoral political advancement in a landscape lit only by kinetoscopes and lightning. Brattiness pied and squared will break free of language and therefore of all moral accountability. I see a land smudged by leavings. I see Fame for no skill beyond being oft-daguerreotyped. Ahead lies a time when one wins by avoiding questions, not answering them. A time when 'I should' yields to 'Me no want DO!' I fear I am correct, but, you know, Nat? I would prefer not. Is this not how we so viscerally recognize our Lucy?\\"   Hawthorne, asking Isabel for a guitar rendition of \\"The Last Rose of Summer,\\" quick, replied, \\"I fear we recognize her from ancestral accounts of certain female persons late of Salem.\\"   Stuff this footnote into your Christmas stocking. Fellow believers, take to your hearts little Lucy Honicutt. Her anonymous influence on American allegory can still be felt, even beyond Melville's reputed last words. (A tactless doctor announced that the great man's end might well be nigh; Melville turned his head toward the wallpaper, sighing, \\"Lucy? Me no want DO!\\") Isabel, alas, would drown at 15 during an overambitious rowboat lesson. Lucy lived on to fuller diction and a dervish career of cleaning; she became landlady of a boardinghouse for Amherst College boys who feared and yet, some claimed, also worshiped her. If the 20th century commenced as a prodigy of purest possibility, who among us can argue with the divine Melville's prediction that it is ending as really quite the brat?   Shall we try discipline? Too late? Shall we then institutionalize it? Too big to catch now? Shall we claim \\"it's just going through a phase\\"? How can we hide from it, chucking lit firecrackers into our very caskets?   Anyhow, Happy Holiday, fellow wild-child. And God? (Not shown above.) God, please, remember us here below, and bless us every one!

For this reason, it makes a smashing first impression from the air, dotted with parks and scattered around an ice-blue tongue of the Pacific called Burrard Inlet. Even the modern high-rise heart of the city, which occupies a curving pinky finger of a peninsula on the south side of the bay, gets upstaged by nature in the form of the Coast Mountains towering to the north, their shoulders patched with snow, peaks poking into the clouds, and forests bleeding down into the city streets below. \\n\\nI flew into Vancouver in late June for a four-day visit, poring through a guidebook during the five-hour trip from New York (which cost me $562 on Air Canada, with a return from Calgary), learning something else that appealed to me -- Vancouver is a fresh, relatively new city, not too encumbered by history.

Great was the joy of all the boys and girls when the heroine slashed the hero's bonds with a breadknife. Few of the youngsters could contain themselves when Jim locked some of the rascals in a burning building and told them to roast or put out the fire. Then Jim turned his attention to the ringleader of the band of rogues, and after a fierce struggle he dexterously fixed the noose, which was to have been used around his own neck, about Hank Milford's ankle and let the desperado swing head down from the balcony.When Polly Graydon, the pretty heroine, sped forth to warn Jim that the blackguards were going to demolish his dwelling by causing a landslide, one boy was particularly struck by a lamb, which had received a great deal of attention from Jim. Therefore when Jim moved his sheep out of danger this child was delighted when he observed that the lamb was safe.\\"There's the lamb, hot dog!\\" yelled the youngster.The humorous passage that appealed most strongly to these youthful critics was where Aunt Judy goes to bed in a bunk and discovers that her feet are always coming out at the end. No matter what Aunt Judy did, her feet were bound to appear from under the bedclothes, and owing to the fact that her pedal extremities were nearest to the lens, the children were also tickled by their size.Jim had killed at least two men, but as he had done it in self-defense, he was excused by the owners of the shrill voices. True, one of the men was Polly's uncle; but what of it? He showed what he was by his associates. Jim's family had for generations owned the rights to several water holes, and the trouble centred around the idea of every Tom, Dick and Harry wanting to use the watering places without his permission.Mr. Boyd is rather severe as Jim; but then he has a great deal to shoulder, and comes within an ace of being hung.

In the Who's early songs, he managed to be just that.  His lyrics and the tension between his unyielding power chords on guitar and the drummer Keith Moon's anarchic, swirling cymbals, perfectly mirrored a male adolescent's hormonal tides of bravado and self-doubt.

A1    The Kurdish prison population in northeastern Iraq has swelled to include at least several hundred suspected insurgents, but the Kurdish regional government does not yet have a policy or legal system to review their cases, a situation that led to a prison strike this month.  A12    Checkpoint Removal in Gaza  Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, left, acting on a pledge to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, approved the removal of more than two dozen checkpoints in the West Bank and agreed to improve the flow of goods in and out of Gaza.  A8    Ethiopian Attack in Mogadishu  An Ethiopian fighter jet strafed the Mogadishu airport in a show of force that took the conflict between Somalia's provisional government and Islamist movement to the capital for the first time in nearly a week of fighting. The Islamists have retreated from at least two towns.  A14    Affluent Bolivians Defy Morales  President Evo Morales of Bolivia's agenda has encountered intense resistance in the country's affluent lowlands, where pressure for more political autonomy and a greater share of the nation's natural gas revenues has become the most pressing challenge to his government.  A3    Chile May Reform Pension Plan  The Chilean government has recommended that the country's privatized pension system be supplanted by one in which the state plays a larger role. The proposed changes include a minimum pension for the country's poorest citizens.  A18    Battle of the Sexes in France  The contest for the French presidency, the first one in which a major party has nominated a woman, is shaping up to be one of competing male-female images: Ségolène Royal, the Socialist, has portrayed herself as a mother-protector while characterizing her expected opponent, Nicolas Sarkozy, as a Darwinian male.  A10    Bosnian War Criminal Tracked  Details are emerging in a Belgrade courtroom of how the former commander of the Bosnian Serb army, Gen. Ratko Mladic, wanted for the most heinous crimes of Bosnia's bloody civil war from 1992 to 1995, has managed to elude thousands of Western peacekeepers and Belgrade police forces for 11 years.  A16    NATIONAL A22-33    Bipartisan Effort in Works To Draft Immigration Bill  Counting on the support of the new Democratic majority in Congress, Democratic lawmakers and their Republican allies are working on measures that could place millions of illegal immigrants on a more direct path to citizenship than would a bill that the Senate passed in the spring. A1    Some See No Change in Bush  After the beating his party took in November, President Bush indicated that he had received the message that voters wanted change, and that he would serve some up fast. But in the last two weeks, the critics and even some allies say, they have seen a reversal.   A24    Blacks Struggle to Find Nannies  As more blacks move up the economic ladder, one fixture -- some would say necessity -- of the upper-middle-class income bracket often eludes them. Like hailing a cab in Midtown Manhattan, searching for a nanny can be an exasperating, humiliating exercise for many blacks, the kind of ordeal that makes them wonder aloud what year it is.   A1    Ex-Tenants Fight for Projects  The heritage of suspicion and misery separating New Orleans's poorest residents from its comfortable classes is playing out in a fierce battle over the future of the public housing projects there, a fight in which the shelter of as many as 20,000 people is at stake.   A22    Faith Consultant Raises Votes  Democratic Party strategists and nonpartisan pollsters credit Mara Vanderslice and her 2-year-old consulting firm, Common Good Strategies, with helping a handful of Democratic candidates make deep inroads among white evangelical and churchgoing Roman Catholic voters in Kansas, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. But some in the party are not pleased.  A22    New Drunken-Driving Tactic  The Police Department of Bennington, Vt., has distributed to local bars and restaurants 200 pint glasses bearing three of its logos. ''It's about alcohol awareness, trying to get people to drink responsibly and not drink and drive,'' said Lt. Paul Doucette of the department. ''When they see the police logo, maybe they'll stop and think.''

A1    Reclassified Homicides Rise  For reasons that no one can quite explain, ''reclassified'' homicides, deaths linked to injuries incurred in months or years past, reached a record number in New York City this year. In all, 35 deaths in the city this year have been linked to wounds incurred as long as 30 years ago. That is roughly three times the historical average, and 14 more than the year before. B1    Mayor Asks Kuwait for Aid  Mayor Lawrence G. Chiaravallo, of Lake Como, N.J., conducted international relations on behalf of this town of 1,800 people. He asked Kuwaiti envoys to finance a new police station, a fire department and a judge's chambers at a cost of $3.7 million. Some are displeased that Mr. Chiaravallo kept his project quiet.

F7    Health & Fitness F5    SPORTSTUESDAY D1-8    Older Skiers Testing the Limits  Rigorous specialty ski and snowboarding camps -- mini-boot camps that promise improved skills -- have become a popular adjunct to the conventional one-hour, private ski-school lesson. The majority of students are 45 to 65 years old, baby boomers who want to ski what would give others a fright.

This is a movie in which emotional abandon is taken to mean that anything may be worn to the beach except a bathing suit; and the excitement of the place, the dress, and the person is really less than one can bear.

The movies have seized Japan like an epidemic, and every picture hall is crowded night after night the year around.While the foreign films are usually the best and most elaborate, strange to say the most popular film at the present time is of Japanese origin, and was made in Tokio. It has run in certain cinema halls in Japan for more than a year and still draws a crowd.All any cinema hall has to do to fill its seats is to advertise this local film and the crowd will be on hand. Seeing the unprecedented success of the film many enterprising dealers have made picture post cards of parts thereof and made fortunes selling them. Others of a musical turn of mind have made songs on the film and made money from the ditties.The reel is called the \\"Schoolmaster Matsumoto,\\" and records the dauntless bravery of a school teacher. The reel begins on the grounds of Nagata Common School in Tokio, near Akasaka Mitsuké in Kojimachi ward, the school children playing all about. One of the lads drops a fountain pen, which another picks up and slyly pockets, but he is seen by another pupil, who informs a teacher of the incident.The teacher summons the three lads concerned, and relating the circumstances asks the guilty one to confess","excerpt":"but the lad denies it. The teacher, remonstrating with the boy, asks him whether he has forgotten the story of George Washington and the hatchet which the boys had recently had as a school lesson. At this point in the film comes the cherry tree and Washington with his hatchet, a scene that can be made very real in Japan, the land of cherry treees. There stands little George with his hatchet, all as real as life. Washington's father is there likewise, as a necessary part of the picture.The scene changes back to the school grounds with children all about, the three boys still before their teacher. The boy that lost the pen approaches the teacher and says that since it was a very cheap pen there is no great loss. The boy who picked up the pen still denies it; and the teacher lets them all go, very differently from a western teacher, who doubtless would have had the thief searched. But the Japanese teacher only blames himself, saying that the fault is his as his teaching on morals had been defective. Thus soliloquizing and blaming himself, he takes a stick and beats his hand until it bleeds. This sort of sacrifice is considered very brave and noble in Japan, like the patriots who sign petitions in their own blood or cut off fingers in protest against some wrong. All seeing the action of the teacher now know that something great must be expected of him in future.It must be remembered that the drama is based to some extent on real life. On a certain day in November, 1919, the pupils of the Nagata School held an excursion to Inokuchi Park, a suburb of Tokio. A boy who was playing about fell into a stream, whereupon another boy who saw the accident raised an outcry.The teacher, Matsumoto, ran to the place and immediately jumped in after the lad. The latter was saved by clinging to a bunch of long grass, but the teacher was drowned. This part of the story is true. The scene of rescuing the body in the film is as pathetic as real life. The story of the film is based on this tragic bit of realism. On the day when the film was taken the children of the Nagata School were given a holiday and the reel was made from real life. The family of the dead teacher were all present to see the taking of the film.Naturally, at all moving-picture halls where the reel is shown school children are most numerous; and all of them are deeply moved by the noble action of Schoolmaster Matsumoto. Often the whole audience bursts into tears during the more pathetic portion of the play. Japanese children are particularly susceptible to emotion in regard to such circumstances as the reel depicts so vividly and well.The film is approved as revealing in a unique way the virtue known as yamato damashii, the Japanese spirit. The noble deed aroused the generosity of the general public and a monument is to be erected to the honor of so noble a man as Schoolmaster Matsumoto.One striking difference between moving-picture halls in Japan and those in other countries is that the entire audience removes its footwear before entering the hall and checks them at the entrance as Americans check their hats and coats.One of the most unique occupations in Japan is that of taking care of footwear. Japanese footwear, to begin with, is very different from that used in the West.Such things as geta, setta and zori are unknown in other lands, and when entering the house these must be taken off. If it be a theatre or assembly room where a large crowd gathers, hundreds and even thousands of geta must be left outside, and some one must take care of them.The custodians of footwear at public buildings and other places of resort have to receive the goods left in their charge and give a check for them, giving the guest a pair of slippers to wear indoors; and then when the guest returns to take back the slippers and give him his own geta in return, when he must return the check.The latter is usually a bit of wood with a number corresponding to that on the tag attached to the footwear. These custodians of footwear are known as gesokuban, one of the oldest of occupations and found only in Japan.At story-telling halls, moving-picture halls and so on, these custodians are to be found. There is an office in most cities in Japan where getaban or gesokuban for an evening can be had, if any one is having a reception and desires thus to accommodate his guests. In large office buildings nowadays shoes are worn, but in all houses with matting floors shoes are not allowed. In libraries, for example, this is usually the case, and men to take care of the patrons must be always on hand.At the Uyeno library these men have to take care of the footwear of some 3,000 people a day. At big department stores like Mitsukoshi such men are always found ready to check one's footwear; and such men require peculiar skill and tact.

If a picture could somehow shape the way a country thinks, and then throughout a week, by its republication, reflect the way the country's thinking and emotions developed, then this photograph may have done both.

The blunt and unpleasant fact is that \\"Nightingale,\\" the Soviet's first all-color picture, is pretty bad. Although it evoked some partisan cheers at the Cameo yesterday, we suspect that the applause was for its ideology, not for the accomplishments of Nickolai Ekk, his technicians and his cast. Unless you look at it through red-tinted glasses and have a Russian interpreter by your side, it is likely to bore you pink.The picture is a rather amazing anachronism in one respect, combining that newest attribute of the cinema—color—with an editing technique characteristic of the silent films of the pre-war era. Instead of employing superimposed dialogue titles which permit us to follow the speeches and action, it makes ceaseless use of long subtitles explaining not merely action that is to come but action that never is depicted on the screen. Thus a subtitle, or connected series of subtitles, may inform us that a group of factory workers, long oppressed, has decided to revolt","excerpt":"but the next image on the screen may be nothing more than a protracted close-up of a blond and blue-eyed worker, posed against a setting sun.Mr. Ekk's color composition is vagrantly arresting, particularly in those scenes where he has subdued his tints to the scale just above that of ordinary black and white photography, but he has been guilty of some outrageous lithographs, and he shows himself to be overfond of portraiture. In this connection, incidentally, it might be noted that the Russian color process is more successful than Hollywood's Technicolor in dealing with flesh tones. In general, however, it is all too obvious that the Russian color-film still is in an experimental state. It is sharply defined one minute, blurred the next, and garish and somber by unexpected turns.The story proper is equally vacillating, asking consideration as a drama of pre-revolutionary Russia while containing more nonsense than we might have expected from a thorough farce. The tale, briefly, is that of the revolt of the women employes of a pottery factory after they learn that a fire which destroyed the old plant and killed several of their number had been planned by the factory owner for the insurance money. Overcoming the lecherous old foreman, who had been chasing the heroine—called the Nightingale, because she sings—with sinister intent, they barricade themselves in the factory, and sally forth triumphantly, armed with dishes and bric-à-brac, to drive off the counter-revolutionary Cossacks.Whether you call it \\"Nightingale,\\" or \\"The Bolshevists in the China Shop\\" it still is a dullish item and merits consideration only as a cinema curiosity; Russia's attempt to surmount the hurdle of color.

And it is happily one of these—a saucy souvenir of better days, somewhat ambiguously titled \\"The Man Who Seeks the Truth\\"—with which the World is reopening another season of French films.So comfortably was Raimu located at the World last season in \\"The Baker's Wife\\" that it is fitting—and just a shade nostalgic—to find him there again. It is oddly coincidental, too. For \\"The Man Who Seeks the Truth\\"—he being, of course, Raimu—bears more than a passing resemblance to the poor baker who had so much trouble with his femme. This time he is a banker, not a baker, and the woman is his mistress, not his wife","excerpt":"but the old boy, for all his fancier layout and his more cultivated ways, is still undergoing the same torture at having horns put on his head.Comparisons are therefore inevitable. And one must truthfully say that \\"The Man Who Seeks the Truth\\" hasn't quite the yeasty flavor and the poignant irony of \\"The Baker's Wife.\\" It is more on the drawing-room side, and the comedy cuts closer to farce. But it bubbles with sardonic humor of the freely, frankly French variety; it turns on a titillating twist, whereby the shrewd old boy fakes deafness to apprehend his girl; it does possess some touches of philosophy, pertaining mainly to 1'amour and gathering years. And it has Raimu as its star, which is the most important thing.This delightfully amiable fellow, with his jaunty whimsies and his blank, despairing glooms, is probably the most comprehending player of middle-aged cuckoos that the screen has ever had, and he pulls all the stops in this film. He preens with such delicate affectation, he woos his lady love so winsomely, he acknowledges the element of doubt with such virtuous reluctance and he accepts the proof with positive pain. There is so much of the average man in Raimu that he is thoroughly exceptional. For broader humor, we recommend his conversation with an English banker over the telephone, in which he kicks the \\"strange\\" language around, and a scene wherein two doctors examine the old faker for deafness.Other very comic performances are given by Alerme and Tramel, and Jacqueline Delubac is lovely (which is all she has to be) as the mistress. But it is strictly Raimu's picture, and the camera never forgets it. That is the highest recommendation we can think of for a French film these days.

Those female slaves worked side by side with men, sabotaged slavery at every turn, Miss Davis says, sometimes even killed their own children to spare them servitude, and, ''passed on to their nominally free female descendants a legacy of hard work, perseverance and self-reliance, a legacy of tenacity, resistance and insistence on sexual equality - in short, a legacy spelling out standards for a new womanhood.''

One of these has been described as the best production ever turned out of a British studio by a British company under British direction. \\"As good as anything that was ever done at Hollywood,\\" wrote one critic. \\"A first-class thriller which will challenge comparison with the world's best films,\\" said another. \\"As technically perfect as the finest American pictures, and polished till it seems as smooth as glass,\\" was another commendation.There were other notices so laudatory that their exuberance can only be explained by the assumption that the writers had been surprised into exaggeration by the pleasure of seeing a native product which really deserved a meed of praise. \\"Rome Express\\" is the title of this outstanding picture. Comparisons have been made between it and the American and Russian productions of the express-train nomenclature which preceded the British film. There was little or no ground for comparison, for all three are essentially different.\\"Rome Express\\" is among the first fruits of the new studios put up by the Gaumont-British Company at Shepherd's Bush, within the London metropolitan area. These studios are understood to have cost a mint of money and to be technically as well equipped as any in Europe if not in the world, which includes America. The company is both a producing and distributing organization and controls a big chain of theatres, and has a capital of some twenty million pounds sterling. Walter Forde, who started his career as a boy juggler on the vaudeville stage, then turned to the cinema and directed and acted in a number of silent pictures with success, later went to America to study methods there, came back to England and made a hit with his direction of a Jack Hulbert comedy, was entrusted with the making of \\"Rome Express.\\"The Cast.Michael Balcon, chief of the executive department of Gaumont-British, got together an all-star cast of British actors and reinforced them with Conrad Veidt and Esther Ralston to play the rôles of an international crook of presumably German extraction and an American film star. The story provided was a fairly good one, turning on the theft of a painting by Van Dyck. The long arms of coincidence were somewhat strained in the matter of bringing together on the same train running between Paris and Rome a trio of people who have a special interest in the stolen picture and several other persons whose various relationships might be taken to show what a small world we live in","excerpt":"but the rather complicated plot is worked out with commendable clarity and contains enough elements of mystery, suspense, passion and comedy to make it quite a good bill of entertainment.In fact, if the production had been less good and the acting of the parts less admirable, and the interest less well maintained throughout, the story could not have escaped much criticism. Melodrama is nicely assuaged with humor and some impossible situations are made to seem credible by neat presentation.Gordon Harker, who has won a reputation as about the best character actor of humorous types on the British screen, plays the rôle of a middle-class English \\"gent\\" with consummate ability and almost steals the picture at times. Cedric Hardwicke, Donald Calthrop and Harold Huth contribute fine impersonations, and Miss Esther Ralston, imported from Hollywood as an American film star, and Miss Jean Barry as an English girl running away from her husband, are adequate.It is chiefly because of its technical qualities that \\"Rome Express\\" has attracted so much attention from the experts. The photography and sound-recording both mark a considerable advance in British production. It has, however, to be remembered that for one picture of this technical merit issuing from a British studio there are at least half a dozen of equal quality, if not even a little bit superior, turned out from Hollywood.

IT seems natural to discuss May Sarton's 17th novel, ''Anger,'' in the context of the work that immediately preceded it - her remarkable book ''Recovering: A Journal 1978-1979'' - so linked, at times so nearly identical, are their major themes.   ''Anger'' is the story of a marriage of opposites: between the opera singer Anna Lindstrom, half-Italian, half-Swedish, artistic, passionate and verbal, and Ned Fraser, a Boston bank president who insists on making love with the lights out and achieves tender communication only with his dachshund. These two characters are the medium through which Miss Sarton voices her concern about intimacy, repression and self-knowledge. ''Anger'' sets out to prove the truth of a Rilke quotation initially invoked by Anna with her husband in mind: ''Perhaps everything terrible in us is in its deepest being something helpless that needs help.'' It would be a dense reader who failed to see that Ned's coldness has its roots in a protective reaction against early loss and guilt and that he ''needs help''","excerpt":"but the resolution of his problems and the reaching for this truth are too facile to have much impact.

With a Foreword by Maxine Kumin.  622 pp. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co. $20.00.     IT is every poet's dream not only to have written poetry of the magisterial quality of William Butler Yeats's, but to have had the opportunity, over a period of years, to reimagine and remake individual poems into components of a single Collected Works. And it is every poet's nightmare to die in medias res, risking the posthumous indignity of a Collected Works assembled by others, however well intentioned, that is a melange of the first-rate and the provisionary, the apparent sketch, the bitter self-parody, the ephemeral, the unfortunate, the simple mistake.   Criticism of Anne Sexton during her lifetime for the inordinately ''confessional'' nature of her poetry has, perhaps, been misdirected. Lyric poetry, from Sappho to Sidney, Donne and Shakespeare, from Byron to Yeats and Lawrence and the ''confessional'' poets of our time, has obsessively analyzed the self and the self's dazzling adventures, usually in love. That the self-absorbed poet is always in danger of exhausting his material, and straining the capacity of his language to say familiar things in original ways, is evident","excerpt":"but the risk is one most poets are willing to take.
