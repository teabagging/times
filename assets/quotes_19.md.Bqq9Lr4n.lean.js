But in 1986, the Reagan Administration muscled into place a policy calling for \\"drug-free\\" Federal work places, including a clause that mandated drug testing for some workers. In itself, that action might have had little impact on anyone except employees periodically required to hand over a beaker of urine. But the executive order led to the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, which required companies with Federal contracts to establish drug policies and make \\"good faith\\" efforts to maintain a drug-free work place.   That    did    have an impact, not only on companies with Federal ties but on ones that want them in the future. One result, according to a report released this month by the American Management Association, is a vast expansion of drug-testing among its members, 7,000 medium- to large-sized firms representing some 25 percent of the American work force. According to the report, three-quarters of the 1,200 companies responding to the A.M.A.'s questionnaire now test for controlled and illegal substances -- which is to say, not alcohol.

School officials acknowledge that the high court had good reasons for making a legal distinction between athletes, who volunteer for a team, and other students. They agree that athletes serve as role models and may have special safety needs. But as a practical matter, they said, it would probably make more sense to test students not involved in sports.    \\"Most of our statistics indicate that there probably would be a lesser percentage of people participating in extra-curricular activities who were involved in recreational use of drugs,\\" said Ralph Swearngin, associate director of the Georgia High School Association.     Many coaches say their athletes are far more likely to use steroids than street drugs. But while a marijuana test costs $20 or less, a steroid test runs $70 and up.

And, if so, what can be done about them?   A new study by Bernard L. Weinstein, a professor at Southern Methodist University who serves as chairman of Gov. Mark White's Economic Advisory Council, and his S.M.U. colleague, Harold T. Gross, finds that changes in world trade patterns have been the major cause of job and income losses for Texas's three ''basic'' industries - energy, high tech and agriculture.   And they believe that the implications of structural change in those areas will continue to have ''severe implications'' for the overall health of the Texas economy.

But in that context, the negative connotations of the word should be forgotten. In my house we wrestled, raced, slugged, and body-slammed our way through childhood. Although never meant as a replacement for a hug and a kiss, the intimacy of violent play helped bond us. Until I was 12, my middle-aged mother could pin me in under a minute.   I am the youngest and, like my older brothers, wanted a job in the National Football League. I started playing when I was 12. At that age, the violent aspect of football is nonexistent. But by the time I had been recruited to play for Cornell University, the game I played was one of horrific violence. Modern American football is the manifestation of the tribal instinct inherent in all humans. As such it mirrors a battle: real estate is the end, and hand-to-hand combat is the means.   And for most of the young men who play football, the stakes are just as dear. The obsession with success on the field is common and accepted by all who play. Also accepted, and just as common, are the various means of obtaining success, including steroids.   No single element of physical training has had as much impact on sports as anabolic steroids. They are the genie's third wish to thousands of athletes who have slaved on the track and in the gym all their lives. Just that little pill, or that quick injection, and training results leap to a new dimension. Every football player on \\"the juice\\" chuckles as doctor after doctor tells him that there's no proof steroids really work.   I took steroids. I wanted that extra something to make my body that much more potent on the field. Some people \\"add\\" to their resumes, football players \\"add\\" to their bodies. You see, the more powerful your weapon (body), the greater chance the battle (game) will swing your way.   Before I go any further, one clarification must be made. The 30-some pounds of equipment a football player wears are not for protection. The pads and helmet are made of hard plastics and steel. The helmet alone can weigh up to eight pounds and, when propelled by a 220-pound man at about 13 miles an hour, becomes a weapon of fantastic destruction. It is said that in major college and professional football the injury rate exceeds 100 percent.   In other words, if you play football, you will be injured. I have had 13 concussions, a separated shoulder, a torn rotator cuff, severely torn muscles in my back and legs, sprained ankles, knees, and elbows, broken fingers and toes, and innumerable abrasions and cuts, each of which would be worthy of a $150 doctor bill to a normal person.   My nose has been smashed so many times that it occasionally bleeds of its own accord, and my left nostril is virtually closed by scar tissue. But these are common and superficial badges of courage to a dedicated football player. In any event, they did not slow my career.   My experience with injuries and their treatment, which occurred primarily in junior college, taught me much about the culture of football. The constant presence of injuries on a football team creates a life style in the locker room akin to that of a computer repair shop. The idea is to make the players play with as little pain as possible and to reduce the \\"down time,\\" or time away from the field. In this way, the players are like computers, and the less time they spend in repair the better.   Because injuries are rarely healed, the trick is to keep them from affecting the player's performance. This is done through a myriad of techniques and drugs. The first battery of these are preventive. The players are made to achieve an awesome physical condition. Bigger, stronger, faster, are the watchwords. Running and lifting weights are the basic tools, aided by chemicals. Anabolic steroids are illegal and readily available. I have never been explicitly pushed by a coach or a doctor, but the pressure of keeping up with the competition was always there.   My experience with steroids consisted of a nine-week cycle of Dianabol in an effort to increase my strength and size. It was necessary to almost double my protein intake to supply the energy and building material my body suddenly craved. I was careful to also increase my aerobic exercise to keep my body-fat percentage down, a common problem when on the \\"juice.\\" In six weeks I experienced a 35 percent increase in strength and went from 219 pounds to 241 pounds without a significant increase in body fat. My body had become a muscle-tissue factory. And because speed comes from muscle, the extra strength in my legs more than made up for my weight gain.   At the age of 19, I was 6 feet 1 inch, 241 pounds, could run a 40-yard dash in 4.7 seconds, and could bench-press 375 pounds. My friends and I would wink at each other at the gym and say \\"Better bodies by DuPont!\\" It is a sad fact that I was so driven to succeed that I risked my health with such a practice. I may yet pay the price through deteriorated kidneys or other side effects.   If preventive body-building does not do the job of protection it should, the trainer must then either heal the injury or suppress its undesired effects. Resting the injured part of the player is often all that is needed. If a torn quadriceps muscle can mend itself in a few days, great. But if game time comes and there is still a problem, the player must \\"suck it up,\\" meaning the pain must be endured, and the injury will have to mend later.   Playing with pain is the most common cliche in football. It is done with mental and physical toughness, aided by machines and, even more, chemicals. My career was ended when an injury was not healable without several years of repair, and not being able to afford several years off from football because of National Collegiate Athletic Association eligibility rules, I was forced to play with damaged legs.   The plan was to play with the pain, and pray that the situation did not worsen. The following is the history of my denouement. It will serve to illustrate the huge role chemistry plays in keeping players on the field regardless of their health.   In my second and last season of junior college football, just before I transferred to Cornell, my legs began to have sharp pains. It was immediately diagnosed by the trainer as shin splints.   After several weeks the pain had become so severe it affected my walking and the inflammation was visible to the eye as bulges on the front of my lower legs. I was sent to a doctor for X-rays. Nothing was ever said about the results, only that I should not worry about them unless they (the trainers) told me to. I went on playing.   At the end of my last season in junior college, I was taking four to five aspirin, 1,600 milligrams of an anti-inflammatory drug, and 800 milligrams of an anti-inflammatory analgesic every day before practice. I was so drugged during the week that my hands would tingle and lose feeling as I ran onto the practice field. Without enough anti-inflammatory, my legs would swell enough to cut off nerves to my feet, and I would lose some control of them. Many is the time my feet dangled nearly paralyzed at the end of the day.   Game day was more important than practice, though, and required special preparation. As soon as I arrived at the stadium, I went to the training room for a shot of cortisone in each shin. Even at the time I was given the shots, I knew that although they helped heal in the short run, prolonged use would eat away tissue in my legs. After the shots I was given pills of codeine to kill the pain and caffeine to counteract the narcotic effects of the codeine.   With my legs sore from the shots and with my head buzzing from the drugs, I dressed and got all the other sore spots (tendinitis in both wrists, sprained thumb, loss of most of the skin on my left palm) supported or protected with tape. Now I was ready for the final phase of my pregame preparation.   First, a machine was hooked up to both shins. for a treatment that consisted of electrodes shooting pulses of current through the injury in an effort to facilitate healing and kill pain receptors. After 20 minutes of this, a physical therapist massaged my shins with a metal rod hooked to an ultrasound machine. This produced a great deal of heat inside the legs. This was followed by successive icings and heat ointments meant to burn out the nerve endings. Finally, both shins were shot with either Novocaine or Lidocaine (local anesthetics), heat ointment was applied, and my legs were wrapped tight with tape. A plastic and foam pad was placed on top of the tape, and held in place with more tape. I put my shoes on, doubled the dose of pills I took before practice, and I went into the spotlight.   When I was being recruited by Cornell and other four-year schools, I always assured them that I was not one who was easily injured. This increased my value as a commodity. You see, a successful football program can mean huge numbers of dollars to a college. Coaches, fully aware of how much money a full scholarship is worth, and how much recruiting a player can cost, look for a profitable return on their investment. A player wooed into coming to a certain school had better perform on the field. Thus, the pressure to do or take whatever will make you a better football player, or will keep you on the field despite injury. I knew this business aspect of college football, and treated my recruitment as such. Even as Cornell spent thousands flying me from my home in Los Angeles to Ithaca, N.Y., and calling me every day at their own expense, I maintained I was fit as a fiddle, all the while praying that my legs would heal, and really believing they would. They never did. The real trouble with my battered legs was discovered while undergoing routine physicals for Cornell football in late summer of 1987. X-rays were taken","excerpt":"tests were done, but again I was not given the whole story. As it turned out, however, I could no longer function. My feet were almost useless, and the slightest touch of my shins sent pain through my entire leg. I had a biomechanical birth defect in both feet, causing tendon/muscle strain in my shins, which, in turn, caused inflammation and pain.   It was not common shin splints but a serious orthopedic problem that only appeared when I grew big and strong enough to damage my own tissue. At least a year off was needed to build orthotics for my shoes and to go through intensive physical therapy. Only then would I know if my legs would ever heal. If the problem had been dealt with as soon as it appeared, I might have had a chance. As it turned out, I never played for Cornell and was never again able to play football. For the rest of my life I must take special care of my lower legs no matter how innocuous the activity.   I do not regret anything I did. I still love football, and it helped me get into one of the most exclusive schools in the world. I only regret that constraints of a limited youth and huge financial pressure cause football players to become as good as possible as fast as possible. There is a very limited number of years that a young man is any good at football; he either succeeds then or never. This is what drove me and others to mature our bodies at a hyper pace. I have no solution for this dilemma.   The love I and others have for the game cannot be explained, so much of this may be beyond the understanding of the uninitiated. The chemicals were nothing more than a means to an end, and the reward was hearing the roar of your name from the bleachers of a packed stadium as you stood on the field. Chemistry may have contributed to my downfall, but it did even more for my success.

He spent his formative years in Ardsley-on-Hudson, NY and graduated valedictorian from the Hackley School in Tarrytown, NY in 1956. He was a 1960 cum laude graduate of Princeton University and earned an MBA from The Harvard Business School in 1963. While at Princeton, Alan was a member of Cottage Club and studied in the Woodrow Wilson School.

In 1967, he married Susan Snyder of Wayzata, MN. In 1975, he moved to Wayzata to start a new career as an entrepreneur in the fast food industry. His major success came with building Pizza Ventures into the biggest franchisee of Godfather's Pizza. Pizza Ventures went public and was ultimately sold to the parent company in 1984. After selling Pizza Ventures, Alan enjoyed continuing success as a business leader through the roles of private investor and director of several public and private corporations, including The Foothill Group, Chart House, Buffets, Diamond Brands, and AGCO. He was also a dedicated and accomplished golfer who devoted considerable time and effort toward mastering the game. Over the years he was fortunate enough to play golf at many of the world's greatest venues and to share those experiences with his many close friends.

Its shares reached a record high of 48 1/4 a year ago and the Houston-based bank holding company was hailed as ''the Loan Star'' by an admiring Wall Street.    Earlier this month, the cheering suddenly stopped. After reporting steadily higher profits for 65 consecutive quarters, Texas Commerce made a shocking announcement. Earnings for the current quarter, it estimated, will drop to 92 cents a share from $1.41 a year ago. At long last, Texas Commerce, too, had fallen prey to energy-loan problems. In the stock market, this disclosure sent a chill through the shares of Texas bank issues that had enjoyed a mini-rally during the first two months of 1985.

And again one is stilled with pride and admiration as one harks back to the valorous deeds of rugged, resourceful Americans.There was \\"The Covered Wagon,\\" which told in inspiring scenes of the men and women who in defiance of danger and deprivation forged their way in primitive vehicles to the far-off Pacific coast. Then came the presentation of William Fox's \\"The Iron Horse,\\" which told of the same blood and brawn bending its efforts in spanning a continent with steel.This new film deals with the heroic exploit of driving 4,500 head of cattle more than a thousand miles. Two of the players who had important parts in \\"The Covered Wagon,\\" Lois Wilson and Ernest Torrence, are seen in leading rôles in this picture. Jack Holt impersonates Dan McMasters, the hero, and Noah Beery figures as Sim Rudabaugh, a calculating scoundrel.There are some wonderful stretches in which thousands of head of cattle are seen in a marvelous and thrilling stampede, and later being driven across a river. These sequences impart an excellent conception of the well-nigh impossible task facing the cattlemen.Irvin Willat, who produced the natural color film, \\"The Wanderer of the Wasteland,\\" was assigned by the producers, Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, to the task of directing \\"North of 36.\\" In most of the stretches he has accomplished his work with marked ability, proving his cleverness in the handling of the players. But although the picture is a good one, it is by no means equal to \\"The Covered Wagon.\\" In all its many interesting scenes there is nothing to compare with the performances of Tully Marshall and Ernest Torrence as the two lovable old scouts. Mr. Torrence, while he fills a rôle somewhat similar to that he had in \\"The Covered Wagon,\\" does not have the opportunity to impress his appearance upon the spectators as he did in that famous picture.One of the chief failings in this production is the lack of real suspense, which materially weakens the whole story. If the villain wishes to steal a trunk containing the land scrip, he gets hold of it with little or no difficulty. On the other hand, when it is recovered from the hero's wagon, the men who find it on that vehicle carefully refrain from questioning the driver.Although Rudabaugh fires off his pistol and causes a little commotion, he does it with impunity until the last chapter, when he is handed over to the Comanche Indians as the slayer of an Indian girl when she was bathing. In such a story the idea of picturing a girl taking her bath in a chalky stream appears to be superfluous. It is of course done to show Rudabaugh's animal nature.Dan McMasters is an old friend of the heroine's father, but to the viewer of this production he seems to fascinate Taisie Lockart in a very short time and without much reason. Miss Wilson, as Taisie, changes her attire with remarkable rapidity. One minute she is wearing rough, check-cloth knickerbockers and in the next she appears in billowing finery.Rudabaugh's eyes are constantly on the lookout for the trunk filled with land scrip, which he knows will soon be of great value. He and his followers are thwarted in their efforts to obtain the scrip. Mr. Torrence's rôle is that of foreman of Miss Lockhart's ranch. He is grim in repose but has an infectious laugh. He tells one young man to enter Taisie's abode and propose to her, and then proceeds to watch what is going on. When he glues his nose against the window pane he is very funny, and this scene brought forth much laughter from the audience.Jim Nabours (Mr. Torrence) is opposed to driving the great herd of cattle North of 36, but he is overruled by Taisie, who has heard from McMasters that the animals will be worth a fortune owing to the recent railroad facilities.Another humorous touch is where the patrons of a barroom decide to have a cock fight. The audience laughed heartily yesterday when one of the feathered fighters flew out of the ring on to the heads of the eager watchers.Miss Wilson is decidedly attractive in this picture. She is a composed and restrained heroine, even when tackled by Rudabaugh, who again engineers the stealing of the valuable trunk. Mr. Beery is competent in the heavy rôle, and Mr. Holt, is like a young Buffalo Bill, with short hair and whiskers.Although this production is not nearly as good as \\"The Covered Wagon,\\" it is a film of importance and one which will afford much entertainment to those who see it.

Distribution of billions in Federal funds are based on population totals reported by the Census Bureau. The popular wisdom is that if you have more people living in your state, you will receive more money. But a state receives more money only if it gains a greater share of the total population.   California, New York, Texas and Florida are the largest states. If there had been an adjustment, California would have gone from having 11.97 percent of the population to 12.15 percent","excerpt":"Texas from 6.83 percent to 6.85 percent, and Florida from 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent. New York would have gained 500,000 people but its share of the total population would have dropped from 7.23 percent to 7.2.   A few hundredths of a percentage point may not sound like much, but each tenth of a percent is worth $40 million a year in Federal funds. Our rough calculations indicate that New York State would lose $10 million. States should look more carefully at how their population share would change under adjustment before spending a lot of money suing the Census Bureau.

In these dry Texan flatlands, the overwhelming realities are the sky and the road. Tornadoes randomly dip from above and tear up the land. The road is the inescapable metaphor for life itself. A car is such an essential possession, that like an old-time cowboy's trusted horse, it becomes a companion, invested with its own quirky personality.    This relationship between environment and popular music was made vividly clear in a program called \\"The Amarillo Highway,\\" which had two performances at the Church of St.  Ann and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights, on Friday and Saturday evenings. The show featured two West Texan singers and songwriters, Butch Hancock and Terry Allen, and the author Michael Ventura, doing songs and readings. They were joined by Charlene Hancock singing Mr. Ventura's plaintive ballad \\"I Still Go Dancin',\\" which imagines the life of Buddy Holly's character Peggy Sue at 51, and by Jesse Taylor who played acoustic guitar with Mr. Hancock. The songs and poems were illustrated with slides showing the landscape around Holly's Lubbock hometown.
