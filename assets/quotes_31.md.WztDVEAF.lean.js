At the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge there is the first-ever retrospective of the work of Jacob van Ruisdael. As Ruisdael died exactly 300 years ago and is universally agreed to be one of the great Dutch painters of all time, this exhibition cannot be called premature.   Owed primarily to Seymour Slive, director of the Fogg, it includes major loans from many parts of the world. No one who cares for Ruisdael will wish, for instance, to pass up the chance of seeing the two versions of ''The Jewish Cemetery'' - one from Detroit, the other from Dresden - hung side by side. And this is merely one example of the conjunctions that Professor Slive has contrived.   The two cemetery paintings have much to tell us about Ruisdael.  The painting of the tombs has the kind of monumentality that Cezanne was to epitomize once and for all. The observation of nature is as exact as anything in European art since Albrecht Durer's clump of grasses. In each case, the image as a whole has about it something that is unforgettably august. We know what Goethe meant when he said that what we see in Ruisdael's ''Jewish Cemetery'' are not tombs as we know them in life, but ''the tombs of tombs.''

The rediscovery in the mid-1980's of music by the 12th-century abbess Hildegarde of Bingen was a start in that direction, and in recent years, women who worked in the 17th century, most notably Barbara Strozzi, have slowly been drawn out of the shadows.

What is the best way to attract and keep wowrms in the garden soil? Dr. P.N., Madison, Wis.     A.Earthworms usually come in naturally to soils that are well endowed with organic matter. They are especially numerous in compost piles and rich forest soils where there is plenty of food available for them. They will migrate to this kind of soil, if imported and rarely stay put. Cactus Care>    Q.    Now that the holiday season is over, how should we take care of the Christmas cactus, which bloomed well for several weeks. Mrs. S.D., Manhattan.     A. Grow the Christmas cactus normally. Allow the soil to dry out before watering it again, but if the leaves appear to shrivel, not enough water has been applied. Water every week to 10 days is about right but be sure to soak the entire rootball so the water runs out of the pot's drainage hole. If the Christmas cactus can be summered out- doors, fine. Leave it outdoors until well past the frost season as the flower buds are set as the days become shorter. Squirrels    Q.    Is there a practical way to keep squirrels off our bird feeders? We have tried everything. Mrs. D.L.L., Rye Brook, N.Y.     A. We wish there was a solution. However, squirrels seem to get smarter every year and each year gardeners work out their own squirrel-proof ways to keep bird feeders stocked. Many manufacturers claim that their feeders are indeed squirrel-proof, but the furry nuisances somehow meet the challenges. One innovative squirrel-proof feeder is installed on the window to allow close viewing of the bird populations with little interference from the rodents. Although many feeders have been tried, no one magic solution is available. The squirrel population is increasing in many neighborhoods and with their population increases, stresses on homeowners and gardeners by squirrel feeding and nesting antics increases. Vinca>    Q.    In a recent garden magazine we noticed several pictures of pink-flowered vinca. We always thought this plant had blue flowers. Is this a new form? Mrs. S.A., Arlington, Va.     A. The pink-flowered \\"vinca\\" is a periwinkle (Catharanthus) not the groundcover Vinca minor, which does have blue flowers. This annual \\"vinca\\" is not related to the evergreeen groundcover, commonly called myrtle. The pink-flowered \\"vinca\\" is an annual named by the All-America Selections judges as prizewinners for this year. The three \\"vincas\\"y are Pretty in Pink, Pretty in Rose ande Parasol. Seeds are available now from ost of the mail-order catalogues for starting indoors to be grown in the garden this summer. These annuals prefer semi-sunny locations where the soil drains well.

A1    Iraqi officials announced that they had agreed to form a council to make policy on security and economic issues in the new government, in an attempt to include all the country's major factions in the decision-making process at a time of rising sectarian tensions.   A10    Polio as an Unending Challenge  The drive against polio threatens to become a costly display of all that can conspire against even the most ambitious efforts to eliminate a disease: cultural suspicions, logistical nightmares, competition for resources from many other afflictions, and simple exhaustion.   A1    French Unions Set Deadline  Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin of France faced an ultimatum from union leaders to withdraw the employment law that set off huge nationwide demonstrations and sporadic violence, or face a general strike.   A11    Protests Against Belarus Vote  An expected landslide for President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko drew several thousand Belarussians into the streets, as protesters ignored swirling snow and official threats of arrest to denounce the election as a sham.   A11    Hamas Submits Cabinet List  Hamas delivered its proposed cabinet list to the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, and is expected to control the most important government ministries after weeks of negotiations failed to persuade other Palestinian parties to join its government.   A8    NATIONAL   A14-19    Problems for Black Men More Dire, Studies Warn  The plight of black men in the United States is far more dire than is portrayed by common employment and education statistics, a flurry of new scholarly studies warn. And it has worsened in recent years even as an economic boom and welfare reforms have brought gains to black women and many other groups.   A1    Louisiana Aid Reconsidered  The Bush administration originally rejected Louisiana's housing recovery plan. Soon after, Donald E. Powell, President Bush's Gulf Coast rebuilding coordinator, whose own idea of aid had excluded thousands of homeowners, many of them poor, announced that the president would seek $4.2 billion more for Louisiana to compensate homeowners.   A1    Oil Spill Raises New Concerns  An oil spill this month in Alaska, the largest ever on the North Slope, has raised new concerns among state and federal regulators about whether BP, the subsidiary of the oil company that operates the corroded transmission pipeline from which more than 200,000 gallons of crude oil leaked, has been properly maintaining its aging network of wells, pumps and pipelines.   A14    Protest Costs City $2 Million  A clash between the police and antiwar protesters in Oakland, Calif., nearly three years ago will cost the city more than $2 million, including dozens of payouts to people who were injured when officers fired wooden dowels, bean bags and rubber pellets.   A14    Utilities Offer Site for Waste  A group of nuclear utilities planning to build a private nuclear waste dump on an Indian reservation in Utah has offered to sell space there to the federal government. The move could help the government avoid billions of dollars in potential legal damages over its failure to build its own repository.   A14    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-7    New Building Eats Up Envied Manhattan Views  Writers and editors at Condé Nast magazines and top lawyers at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom are dealing with a reality many Manhattan workers face: coming to terms with the construction of a new building, and the loss of their view.

The 246 pages of health-care proposals that were made unofficially public last week represent the promise, the gamble and perhaps the measure of Bill Clinton's presidency are also a textbook example of how to share these unpleasant tasks. The plan's vision is health care, at reasonable cost, for all. Its structure reflects its essential gamble: that the despised tools of taxation and regulation have been camouflaged in enough different ways to make the proposal politically palatable.

For, to put it succinctly, the heroes of this excursion into Never-Never Land are the Pittsburgh Pirates, an aggregation which, it says here, wins the National League pennant. And, to make this fable even more improbable, they are limned as an outfit which snags that baseball gonfalon after wallowing in eighth place—the \\"cellar\\" of the circuit—for the early part of the season. However, now that these facts are in the record, let it be said that this combination of whimsy, sports, religious faith and romance is a heart-warming and edifying amalgam which can pass the test of what is traditionally termed entertainment.Clarence Brown, who produced and directed, and Dorothy Kingsley and George Wells, the scenarists, were, it is apparent, not interested in facts. But they make convincing and thoroughly charming the legends they wish to purvey. The basic tall tale they are spinning is a Forbes Field fantasy. Seems that the Pirates' manager, Guffy McGovern, is an irascible, loud-mouth who hates umpires, his hired hands and all mankind. But, it comes to pass that he is forcibly enjoined by the voice of the spokes-man for \\"Heavenly Choir Nine\\" one evening as he is searching for a lost lucky piece in the area of Forbes Field's second base. Said celestial messenger indicates that our explosive hero might win a few contests—maybe even the flag—if he eschews blasphemy and expends a little milk of human kindness.Our man is willing to try, and miracles do begin to happen. His woeful club wins ten straight games and rises from the cellar to a commanding position in the league. But this is only the beginning. An orphan youngster notes that there is an \\"angel\\" behind each Pittsburgh player and the alert newspaper boys and a beautiful lady reporter go to work on this coincidence. Mr. McGovern is looked on as a screwball by the press which makes much of this natural story. Our man, knowing which side his contract is buttered on, learns to curb his temper and comes, incidentally, to love both the moppet, who, like himself, are the only ones on the side of the angels, and the lady.Paul Douglas was never more neatly cast than he is as the brawling McGovern. He is Runyonesque character to the life, and the person or persons responsible for using the gibberish emanating from the sound track as he battles with umpires rates a kudo for imagination. Janet Leigh is pretty although improbable as the \\"household hints\\" reporter with whom he falls in love and Donna Corcoran, a newcomer to the screen scene, plays the orphan whose visions precipitate the \\"rhubarbs\\" with such unaffected simplicity and grace as to assure her a future in films. And, Keenan Wynn, as the hateful radio man","excerpt":"Spring Byington, as the Mother Superior and guardian of Donna Corcoran, and brief stints by Bing Crosby, Joe DiMaggio, Ty Cobb and Harry Ruby lend them solid assets.\\"Angels in the Outfield,\\" in short, is slight, completely unconvincing but thoroughly delightful.

Injured hamstrings, Heiderscheit says, are especially common in sports that involve fast, hard spurts of running, such as the track and field sprints, but also football and soccer. “The million dollar question is why,” he says. Despite reams of research, there’s no answer. What is known, though, is that a hamstring injury is self-perpetuating. An athlete who’s suffered one is at an enormously increased risk of another. Again, researchers don’t know why that is, although a new study by Heiderscheit and his colleagues is suggestive. In the work, 11 athletes hobbled by hamstrings underwent a M.R.I. examination. In all but two of them, the hamstrings showed “substantial changes in the tissue,” even a year and a half after the injury, Heiderscheit says. Some sections of tissue were enlarged and scarred; others atrophied. The whole was, in effect, remodeled. How that metamorphosis contributes to later injury and, more important, how to use the M.R.I. findings to avoid re-injury “will require a lot more study,” Heiderscheit says.

Last year Mr. Wolf, who had directed East Germany's spying for 33 years until his resignation in 1986, fled to the Soviet Union fearing prosecution and has refused to return without assurances he will not be tried. So far, the Bonn Government has said no. Since 1989, and the first signs of reunification, officials and Western diplomats have reported misgivings in the West German intelligence community over the prospect of prosecuting such high-ranking spies, given that Western espionage agencies engage in the same activity. Among the defendants is Mr. Wolf's successor, Werner Grossmann, who is to be tried for high treason.
