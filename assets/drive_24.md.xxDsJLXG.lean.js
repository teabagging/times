That many will never get off the ground in their creations is almost beside the point.\\n\\nOtto Bishop, the president of one of 10 New Jersey chapters of the Experimental Aircraft Association, says that at least 70 people throughout the state are building full-scale airplanes in their homes.\\n\\n06-12-94 \\"Take me, for instance,\\" Mr. Bishop said. \\"I have a two-car garage but both cars are out and it's taken over a room in the house. My wife will be so happy when I finish dragging those aluminum filings in and out.\\" \\n\\nMr. Bishop, an electrical engineer, has worked 2,000 hours (the equivalent of 250 8-hour days) on his all-metal, single-engine two-seater. He expects to finish it in a year or so, he said. \\n\\nAlong with talent and the good nature of displaced family members, the essential element for most airplane builders is patience. It takes a long time to build a plane.\\n\\nAlbert (Frenchie) Arnaud, 79, has been working for more than 30 years on his 20-foot-long, 24-foot wing-span two-seater. He's up to 6,000 hours and still going.\\n\\n\\"I'm a real cellar person who always wanted to build a plane,\\" Mr. Arnaud said. \\"This is a showpiece,\\" he said, pointing to the gleaming aluminum structure. Mr. Bishop agreed, declaring Mr. Arnaud's plane of museum quality. \\"My trouble is, I keep trying new things to improve it,\\" Mr. Arnaud said. \\"Now I'm designing a new intake manifold. The plane's 300 pounds overweight.\\" \\n\\nBut Mr. Arnaud said that, what having had double bypass surgery, he didn't know whether he'd ever get to fly his plane. Mr. Bishop said that was a problem many builders faced. \\n\\n\\"The project gets too big and some of them get older and lose their flying licenses for medical reasons so they never get in the air,\\" he said. \\n\\nBuilding a personal airplane starts either by buying design plans or working from a kit. After the frame is completed and the engine and instruments are added, the cost is around $20,000. Most builders put in thousands more as they add things like radar equipment and computerized map displays, Mr. Bishop said. \\n\\nTechnicians in the club help prepare the plane for a Federal Aviation Authority inspection, checking the work for quality, looking for correct weight and balance, among other things. Then the authority inspects the aircraft. Planes built under the experimental classification must be tested for 40 hours by a licensed pilot","excerpt":"usually, but not always, the builder himself.\\n\\nAfter passing inspection, the plane is ready to be airborne. The pilot is now allowed to fly anywhere but is urged to stay away from congested areas. \\n\\nMr. Arnaud and Mr. Bishop are among 7 personal airplane builders out of 40 in the association who are building their own planes. Mr. Bishop said that others attend the monthly meetings in Nutley at the Italian-American Civic Center because they are interested in discussing aviation and they enjoy socializing with like-minded individuals. Every fall there is a fly-in at the Sussex Airport, where members get to show off their planes.\\n\\nMr. Bishop said it was a lot easier to seek help and to exchange parts within the club than to order them and then wait at least two weeks for parts to arrive from the West Coast, where most suppliers are based.\\nMost Members Over 40\\n\\n The chapter is made up of men, most over 40, usually engineers and machinists who built model airplanes in their youth. \\n\\nMr. Arnaud, like other association members, enjoys working with tools. His basement is lined from floor to ceiling with jars holding screws and rivets of every size. \\n\\n\\"I never even finished grammar school, but I can build anything from anything, wood, metal or cement,\\" said Mr. Arnaud, a former tool design engineer for the Bendix Corporation. \\"It just comes so easily to me. I built this home for my wife and I 47 years ago, and I did all the wiring, plumbing, concrete, everything from scratch.\\" \\n\\nA motorcyclist for 62 years, Mr. Arnaud keeps busy operating a small basement machine shop for his clients. He works on motorcycles and racing cars and has built carburetor parts for a car that raced at Daytona this year. \\n\\nMr. Bishop said some club members get discouraged over the painstaking work that goes into building an airplane and some eventually give up. \\n\\n\\"I'm sure there are thousands of plans sold to building enthusiasts that never ever become finished as aircraft,\\" Mr. Bishop said. \\"People ask me how can they spend so much time doing this, but I tell them that the years go by watching television too.\\" In Basements and Garages, Unlikely Hangers for Planes"},{"year":"1972","title":"MIAMI, March 5&#8212","excerpt":"Usually, candidate who got no more than 15 per cent of the vote in an election would be reluctant to show his face in public.

They are the lonely relics of the great age of ro-mantic landscape architecture.  And if the gardens themselves have been fortunately preserved, many of their ornamental garden buildings - the Greek temples, rustic stone pyramids, pebbled grottoes and miniature Gothic castles - have long since fallen to ruins.   Curiously, falling to ruins is a part of the folly ethos. Most of them were built originally to look as if they were just that. A nicely contrived ruin gave a touch of Arcadian splendor or a shiver of Gothic gloom to the 18th-century British squire who wanted to be in the forefront of the new fashion for The Picturesque.   Barbara Jones, whose book ''Follies and Grottoes'' (Constable, London, 1953) makes her the dean of British folly-recorders, says, ''A folly might be defined as a useless Page 31 building erected for ornament on a gentleman's estate.
