What was there was the only known manuscript of a 12-line poem by Lord Byron, left, dated April 12, 1812, speaking of friendship and memory and beginning, ''Absent or present still to thee.'' During routine cataloguing, the manuscript, long assumed lost, was found inside an 1810 edition of ''The Pleasures of Memory'' by Samuel Rogers, a patron of the arts and minor poet who entertained writers, artists, actors and politicians in his salon. Ms. Stead said it appeared that Byron's work, published four years later in a volume of collected poems, was inspired by Rogers's book.    Union's Charges       Actors' Equity Association announced yesterday that it had filed an unfair labor practice charge against the Supper Club and its owner, Martin Thesing. Equity accused the Supper Club in the Hotel Edison, at 240 West 47th Street, Manhattan, of refusing to permit the revue ''The Rat Pack Is Back,'' produced, written and directed by David Cassidy (''The Partridge Family''), to continue performances last month because union members were represented in the cast. Equity added that the Supper Club replaced the show with a similar but nonunion production, ''Frank, Dean & Sammy, Live in Concert.'' Mr. Thesing said in a statement, ''The Supper Club is a completely nonunion house and therefore never had any contracts whatsoever with any of the actors in 'The Rat Pack Is Back.'

Half of the profits from the project, which includes lucrative television deals, are to be used in restoring and preserving monuments around the world. The winners are to be announced on Jan. 1, 2007.    And Then There Were Five       Contenders for the Whitbread Book of the Year prize dwindled to five yesterday in London, where winners, chosen from 476 entries, were announced in the five awards categories: novel, first novel, biography, poetry and children's book. One of those works will be chosen the Book of the Year, to be announced on Jan. 24, when its author is to receive the grand prize, the equivalent of $43,000. Each of the category winners receives about $8,600. They are Ali Smith, for ''The Accidental,'' chosen best novel; Tash Aw for ''The Harmony Silk Factory,'' best first novel; Hilary Spurling for ''Matisse the Master,'' the second part of her biography of Matisse; Christopher Logue for ''Cold Calls,'' in poetry; and Kate Thompson for ''The New Policeman,'' best children's book.    After Hunter S. Thompson       Anita Thompson, below, the widow of the flamboyant journalist Hunter S. Thompson, has announced plans to become the co-editor of The Woody Creeker, a magazine expected to make its debut next month, The Associated Press reported. The magazine takes its title from Woody Creek, the Colorado community where the Thompson property is, and Ms. Thompson said it was intended to celebrate the oddities and richness of the locale. She also said she was assembling ''Hunters Wisdom,'' a collection of witticisms, aphorisms and other excerpts from the 14 books by Thompson, who shot himself to death last year.    Second Thoughts       Submitted to 20 publishers and agents, the typed manuscripts of the opening chapters of two books were assumed to be the work of aspiring novelists. Of 21 replies, all but one were rejections. Sent by The Sunday Times of London, the manuscripts were the opening chapters of novels that won Booker Prizes in the 1970's. One was ''Holiday,'' by Stanley Middleton; the other was ''In a Free State,'' by Sir V. S. Naipaul, winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Literature. Mr. Middleton said he wasn't surprised. ''People don't seem to know what a good novel is nowadays,'' he said. Mr. Naipaul said: ''To see something is well written and appetizingly written takes a lot of talent, and there is not a great deal of that around. With all the other forms of entertainment today, there are very few people around who would understand what a good paragraph is.''

As the G.O.P.'s \\"Southern strategy\\" of the 60's appealed to the white backlash against the civil rights movement, Ms. Melich argues, so its misogynist strategy of the 80's and 90's calculatedly exploited the backlash against feminism.

Released in 1995, the first film, directed by Chris Noonan, who also wrote the screenplay with Mr. Miller, spins an enchantingly sunny tale about a young orphaned pig who becomes a prize-winning sheep herder, thereby earning the affections of the farmer (James Cromwell) who might otherwise have made bacon and chops of him. Three years later, Mr. Miller took up the directing reins for the dark and rather more grown-up sequel, which tracks Babe (voiced by E. G. DAILY) as he and the farmer's wife (MAGDA SZUBANSKI) travel to a Dickensian city following a calamity at the farm. A grim metropolis roiling with peril, the city introduces Babe to a world of exotic excitement and a new menagerie whose numbers include chimps and a rampaging pit bull. Babe's nearly fateful meeting with the pit bull conveys more terror and tenderness than similar encounters in most human-centered films, and suggests that the film's bold message -- ''a kind and steady heart can mend a sorry world'' -- may not be so unattainable after all.

Perfunctory about both sex and violence, it involves the dull Duke Togo, also known as Golgo 13, in an array of alternating shootouts and trysts.

You may remember Mr. Romero starred in \\"Tall, Dark and Handsome\\" as the Chicago gang boss with the heart of gold. Douglas fills that part now and Romero plays his ruthless rival, Pretty Willie. We have no quarrel with that switch in casting.In reviewing \\"Tall, Dark and Handsome,\\" Bosley Crowther (who now is in Hollywood on a studio inspection tour) wrote: \\"It's funny, to think of it, how the sparks can be made to fly when sharp writing and fast direction are energetically rubbed together.\\" It's funny, too, come to think of it, how a comment made so long ago can be just as apt today. For \\"Love That Brute,\\" while not a world beater by any means, is bright and breezy entertainment through most of its eighty-odd minutes' running time.Smart acting and crisp dialogue do wonders for a story which might easily have been felled by the weight of its improbabilities. \\"Love That Brute\\" is the fanciful story of a prohibition era gang lord who falls so hard for a respectable young governess that he adopts a ruffian as his son just for an excuse to employ Ruth Manning to be near her. Big Ed Hanley is the most feared man on the South Side of Chicago. His reputation for bumping off those he doesn't like is so awesome that even Pretty Willie, no slouch himself, is happy to stay on the North Side. That is, until Willie also takes a shine to the pretty young thing who has ambitions as a singer.There is no need to know all the details. Indeed too much knowledge might spoil the fun, for the plot is full of silly ramifications, not the least of which is that Big Ed is really a softie. All the fellows he supposedly bumped off live a full life in a sturdy jail, complete with bars, in the cellar of Big Ed's mansion. To reveal that much is not to give away a vital secret, for the twister in this situation is the reaction of Pretty Willie when his dead boys suddenly show up at a big peace celebration.Sometimes the romance get a little too heavy and slows down the pace of the picture. But there is never a dull moment when little Mr. Price, son of the late Detroit Harry, is around. The kid is a pip, and the way he swaggers and tosses out tough talk is just remarkable. He steals practically every scene into which he walks, and he has some pretty good competition at that in Douglas, Romero, Wynn, Miss Peters, Joan Davis and a long list of assorted muggs and dolls who help to make \\"Love That Brute\\" the fun that it is.On the Roxy's stage are Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, the Billy Williams Quartet, the De Marlos","excerpt":"Anita Martel, the Gae Foster Roxyettes and as an \\"extra added attraction,\\" Faye Emerson.

Yet out of all this effort on the part of the Epstein Brothers (Julius J. and Philip G.), Charles Hoffman and Catherine Turney has come a film which only serves to prove how far superior Mr. Barry was at turning a sharp, meaningful phrase. The scenarists have retained only the basic framework of the play and that they have modernized by bringing the action forward to 1939.Thus the picture is permitted to throw some sharp barbs in the direction of war-profiteering industrialists, the while Tom Collier, a reformed playboy, struggles to keep his integrity as the publisher of an honest, liberal magazine carrying on a brave and unprofitable crusade against social injustices. Tom's reformation is brought about by a socially minded photographer who turns down his offer of marriage because she comes from the other side of the tracks. Marrying on the rebound, he acquires a worthless, mercenary and scheming spouse who would make him over into an indolent rich man's son, and it is giving away no secret to reveal that she almost succeeds in keeping him from exposing the corrupt industrialists.Around this story core the scenarists have spun several layers of comedy, but they do not achieve the facility that Mr. Barry exhibited in switching from serious to light to serio-comic situations. In short, the dialogue is blunted, whereas it needs to be razor-edged. So what \\"One More Tomorrow\\" boils down to is just another romantic comedy drama with pretentions of social import.Dennis Morgan is quite good as the wastrel who turns his wealth to noble purpose","excerpt":"Ann Sheridan and Alexis Smith are equally fetching and competent as the photographer and wife, respectively, and Reginald Gardiner gives another of his easy-going, polished performances as the editor of Bantam Magazine.

A Monroe County Court jury found Arthur J. Shawcross guilty of 10 counts of second-degree murder. The jury deliberated six and a half hours over two days before returning the verdicts shortly before 11 A.M.   Jurors rejected defense arguments that Mr. Shawcross was legally insane or extremely emotionally disturbed when he committed the killings.   \\"He's not insane,\\" the jury foreman Robert Edwards said as he announced the verdicts. \\"And he did not suffer extreme emotional disturbance.\\"  Shows No Emotion    Mr. Shawcross, 45 years old, showed no reaction as a court clerk read each of the victim's names and Mr. Edwards responded, \\"guilty of murder in the second degree.\\"   Mr. Shawcross was convicted of killing Dorothy Blackburn, 27","excerpt":"Anna Marie Steffen, 28; Dorothy Keeler, 9; Patricia Ives, 25; Frances Brown, 22; June Stott, 29; Felicia Stephens, 20; Maria Welch, 22, and Darlene Trippi, 32.   The serial killings, which took place between March 1988 and January 1990, occurred while Mr. Shawcross was on parole for two other slayings.    Nine of the victims were prostitutes. All frequented the streets of downtown Rochester, with life styles that made them easy targets for a serial killer. Most of the women were strangled, their bodies left hidden along the Genesee River or in other secluded areas.    Mr. Shawcross faces a trial in neighboring Wayne County next year for the slaying of Elizabeth Gibson, 29.     Mr. Shawcross faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life on each of the 10 counts. He will be sentenced on Feb. 1 by Judge Donald J. Wisner of Monroe County.   A defense lawyer, Thomas Cocuzzi, said he will appeal the conviction. The defense team had asked on Wednesday for a mistrial, on the ground that statements by their own witness, Dr. Dorothy Lewis, a psychiatrist, had biased the jurors. Judge Wisner denied that motion.   In 1972, he confessed to strangling 8-year-old Karen Ann Hill and began a 15-year prison sentence. At that time, he also confessed to the 1972 killing of 10-year-old Jack Blake in Watertown, but he was not prosecuted for that slaying because authorities did not think they had sufficient evidence.

NEWS OF THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Anna Neagle Gets Lead in Film Version of 'Irene'-- 'High Gray Walls' Opening at Criterion"},{"year":"1940","title":"The ways of film producers are indeed inscrutable. Any one who remembers \\"No, No, Nanette\\" from away back in 1925 will recall that the most charming and commendable feature of it was its highly melodious score—tunes such as \\"Tea For Two,\\" \\"I Want to Be Happy,\\" etc. Yet the current screen version of it, which Producer-Director Herbert Wilcox delivered yesterday to the Music Hall, with Anna Neagle in the leading role, uses that airy score for little more than incidental background music, substitutes nothing in its place and meanders tediously through a typical silly musical comedy plot to an exceedingly silly conclusion. Film producers have strange ideas.One might understand and accept this all-but-musicless musical comedy if Mr. Wilcox and his scriptwriter, Ken Englund, had provided a jaunty story with a lacing of wit through it. But what they have fashioned is a fable which is cloying in its sweetness about a little Miss Fixit who helps her philandering old uncle to get out of several embarrassing scrapes with females and, in the process, becomes involved—romantically, of course—with a handsome young artist-fellow and a musical comedy producer. In the end, she picks the artist and her uncle gets straightened out.From a cast of dependable comics, which includes Roland Young, Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts and Eve Arden, Mr. Wilcox has derived about as much mirth as there is in an ancient joke book. He's an Irishman by birth, but his humor has the body of Yorkshire pudding. Richard Carlson and Victor Mature go dutifully through the motions of conventional romantic foils. And Miss Neagle, in the leading and most frequently photographed role, performs with all the coy charm and grace of a self-conscious musical comedy actress trying to be a Dresden china Pollyanna doll.Miss Neagle has now appeared to very dubious advantage in screen versions of \\"Irene\\" and \\"No, No, Nanette,\\" and they say that she is next to play the late Marilyn Miller's role in a translation of \\"Sunny.\\" If she continues at this rate, the fine old nostaglic flavor of American musical comedy will soon be completely dissipated. It is all very depressing, indeed.Fortunately for the Music Hall it has a handsome stage show this week, divided into two parts. The first, the annual Christmas pageant centered about a vision of The Nativity, and the second, a lively, colorful revue featuring a snow man and the old woman who lived in a shoe.

Baltimore County voters turned down a 2 percent limit and Anne Arundel voters rejected a 4.5 percent limit, but only after expensive and determined campaigns by public unions, elected officials and business groups. Nevertheless, voters turned out an entrenched Democratic incumbent County Executive in Baltimore County and elected Republicans in Anne Arundel and Howard Counties.\\n\\nLast Monday, with the backing of Mayor Kurt Schmoke, the City Council approved a 4 percent limit on property assessment increases -- the limit had been 15 percent -- and the Council is now considering cutting the current tax rate. \\n\\nThe $2.5 million loss from the new cap \\"is not going to be that great,\\" Mayor Schmoke said in mid-November, \\"but the positive signal it is sending to middle-class homeowners is significant.\\" \\n\\nCity officials and residents of wealthier neighborhoods insist the city has to be more competitive with the counties on property taxes or more and more moneyed people out of town.

(It seems that her brother has been killed in an automobile accident and her father has committed suicide.)Now let the place be invaded by a cheeky fellow who brazenly claims to be her officially dead brother, has the papers and the memories to prove it, indeed, and is able to make his fraud convincing, even to the police.Here you have the situation that constitutes the crux of \\"Chase a Crooked Shadow,\\" a mystery thriller that came to the Little Carnegie yesterday.Mystery thrillers are tricky, and this one eventually becomes so. It seems that the melancholy lady has a bag of missing diamonds stashed away in the chimney of her beach house and isn't telling anybody where it is. It seems, too, that her own beloved uncle, the only person whom she can trust, is coolly allied with the visitor in the perpetration of the fraud. It seems that all are against her, frying to make her sign her will.What's the mystery behind this business? Are they actually conspiring to rob this seemingly victimized heiress of every teeny diamond she owns? The way they creep up behind her and refuse to leave her alone, even to haunting her in her bedroom, you'd certainly think they were trying to break her down. Or is there something more subtle behind this eerie assault? That's what you learn at the climax, which we are tacitly sworn not to reveal.Frankly, it's nothing amazing, and neither is this film. It's just a moderately well-done program picture, endowed with a couple of standard thrills.Anne Baxter as the heiress and Richard Todd as the fellow who moves in do sufficiently well in the top roles to keep you casually looking at them, although there is some handsome seacoast scenery (in black-and-white) to catch the eye.
