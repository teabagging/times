That leaves operettas and musicals, ballets, lighter operas, modern operas, marginal operas, perhaps also mainstream operas, perhaps friskier productions, often opera in the language of the audience.   In recent years, no secondary opera company has struggled more with such questions of identity, and made more U-turns in its search for a direction, than the Volksoper in Vienna. The city has a powerful operetta tradition, and the Volksoper in recent decades has been its primary preserver.

She maintained a keen interest in dance and in life even in the months before she died, in 1975. Fort was also, to judge from a lavish tribute presented on Sunday night at Symphony Space, a choreographer and dance theorist of imagination and taste.   The program opened with a 1987 group piece, \\"Sergio,\\" by Joan Peters, a protegee of Fort's and artistic director of the tribute, which was inspired by and set partly to the music of Sergio Mendez. The piece, performed by the Joan Peters Dance Company, mixed jazz and Afro-Caribbean dance in a lilting response to the music, which suggested the catholicity and tempering distance of Fort's perspective.

After moving from her native Germany to New York in the early 1920's, Miss Zahn taught at many schools.

The new 20-cent issue, the third in the ongoing American Sports Series, is being put out on July 6 in Chicago, Ill., in conjunction with the 1983 All-Star Game in Comiskey Park. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the first All-Star Game in 1933, a game in which Ruth hit a home run, scoring two runs and winning the game.\\n\\nBabe Ruth, the ''Sultan of Swat,'' ''the King of Clout,'' even the ''Behemoth of Bust,'' was an idol to baseball fans in his heyday and still is to many up to this day. He would undoubtedly have led off the sports series, which began in 1981, were it not for the linkup with the All-Star Game. Two other greats, golfer Bobby Jones and golfer and all-round athlete Mildred ''Babe'' Didrikson, initiated the series.\\n\\nTwo more commemoratives will come in 1984, one for baseball star Roberto Clemente and the other for Jim Thorpe, football All-American and Olympic star.

In the United States, roughly 160 radio stations carried the broadcast.   Even so, Kevin Wall, the chairman of Radiovision, which produced the tribute, says the show cost more than $5 million and won't break even for years. One major factor is that the concert, which included a raft of artists ranging from George Harrison and Eric Clapton to Johnny Cash and Sinead O'Connor, had no corporate sponsorship, which is unusual these days.

But in examining the case of a brave esthete who spent most of his life banished to a miserable army camp the Kiev Film Studio has come up with a tedious, simple-minded glorification, running needlessly for nearly two hours and acutely lacking in restraint and absorption.Igor Savchenko's scenario is a florid, rambling textbook depiction of the hero as a natural-born victim of Czarist oppression, starting with his frenzied pamphleteering as a restless art student and closing with his emergence from virtual imprisonment as an aged hero of the masses. Also directing, Mr. Savchenko has arranged the events and the co-operative cast with a heavy-handed, trumpeting awareness of extreme good and evil, threading the endless clichés with generous quotations from Shevchenko's poems.In spite of the bumbling direction and surrounded by a churning cast of one-dimensional symbols, Sergei Bondarchuk, in the title role, remains almost consistently believable. And K. Sorokin, as a corporal who befriends him during exile, is splendid. Principally because of their low-key emoting in the final scenes, the misery and loneliness of an army outpost are conveyed perfectly. Taras Shevchenko's real greatness, from the balcony of the Stanley, seemed to come not from hysterical motivation but from simple human endurance.
