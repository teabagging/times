They all sat around in our apartment looking serious. I think it was the fear that reading these books would overwhelm other interests that kept us from starting in on them.

Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights","excerpt":"4 p.m.; $25 to $40.    SEX AND THE 70'S  The actress Olympia Dukakis, who has lately been working on the film version of ''A Confederacy of Dunces,'' takes a break for a reading of a new play by Susan Sandler, the author of the play ''Crossing Delancey.'' Ms. Sandler's newest, ''Under the Bed,'' concerns love and lust among the over-70 set, and Ms. Dukakis will be joined by Phyllis Newman, who won a Tony for her role in ''Subways Are for Sleeping.''  Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan; 7:30 p.m.; $10.    BAGHDAD AND BACK  ''About Baghdad'' steps up from a long ride on the festival circuit for a brief theatrical run; in the documentary, shot in July 2003, the director Adam Shapiro follows the Iraqi exile Sinan Antoon for his first visit to Baghdad since 1991. In a tangle of bureaucracy, filming was stopped repeatedly, but three weeks of interviews resulted in conversations with dozens of Iraqis in neighborhoods ranging from the Shiite ghetto to the rich enclaves.  Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, East Village; 9 p.m. (Closes on Tuesday.)    SERIOUS WRITING  C-Span's new program, ''After Words,'' pairs nonfiction authors with experts in the field they have written about. Today's show is a pretty heady match: Sister Helen Prejean, the nun made famous by her book ''Dead Man Walking,'' has recently published ''The Death of Innocents: An Eyewitness Account of Wrongful Executions.'' She is matched with Victoria Toensing, a Washington lawyer and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's criminal division.  C-Span; 6 and 9 p.m.    MONDAY 1|17    THE BIRTH OF COLOR  The director Michael Almereyda spent several years stalking the photographer William Eggleston, whose color photographs of everyday life in the American South created an aesthetic now ubiquitous in the work of art students and advertising executives. Mr. Eggleston is also a hard-drinking, gun-loving, down-home character, qualities that keep ''William Eggleston in the Real World,'' here in its world premiere, from being just another dry art documentary.  Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan; 7:30 p.m.; $10. (Also on Wednesday at 6 p.m.)    CD'S: INDIE-ANA ROCK  The Indiana-based Early Day Miners release ''All Harm Ends Here'' (Secretly Canadian, $15.98) this week; these lo-fi rockers may seem a bit down at the mouth, but they've got enough vim to pack into the van for a national tour, beginning on Tuesday in Lawrence, Kan. On ''Red, White and Black'' (Alternative Tentacles, $13.98), the Southern Californian postpunk outfit the Bellrays still sound as if they're playing in a very fun garage.    SQUATTERS' RIGHTS  The photographer Margaret Morton documented a group of 35 Lower East Side squatters who, from 1993 to 1994, took up residence in a former glass factory, borrowing electricity from the base of nearby streetlights and water from the closest hydrant. Ms. Morton's pictures depict a cozy communal home with more graffiti and less Ikea furniture than the Alphabet City of 2005.  Urban Center Galleries, 457 Madison Avenue, at 50th Street; 11 a.m to 5 p.m. (Through Wednesday.)    TUESDAY 1|18    FINNISH MODERN  Scandinavia House puts forward an exhibition about super-groovy Finnish churches that -- half cold-war bunker, half monument to Modernism -- reinvented the way houses of worship could look. Also: beginning tomorrow, Scandinavia House will screen the Icelandic, Swedish, Danish and Finnish films officially offered for Oscar consideration as best foreign-language film.  58 Park Avenue, near 38th Street. Information: www.scandinaviahouse.org.    COMMON SENSE  Historical-document enthusiasts take note: a rare first edition of Thomas Paine's pamphlet ''Common Sense,'' published in 1776, goes on view today at the New-York Historical Society -- alongside the only surviving portrait of the author painted from life.  Central Park West at 77th Street; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; $10, $5 students and seniors.    DVD'S: FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS  The timely if odd 1993 Kathleen Turner flick ''House of Cards'' finds the husky-voiced actress trying to cure her daughter's autism (Lions Gate, $14.98). ''Friday Night Lights'' (Universal, $29.98; includes deleted scenes) is the actor-turned-director Peter Berg's take on the high school football book of the same name, written by his cousin, H.G. Bissinger.    BERLIOZ RECITAL  The sparkly Bulgarian soprano Krassimira Stoyanova is appearing at the Met in ''Turandot.'' Tonight, her recital will include works by Berlioz, Gounod and Tchaikovsky.  Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall; 8 p.m.; $35.    WEDNESDAY 1|19    ACTORS AND ANIMALS AT THE BALLET  Tonight at the New York City Ballet: Jerome Robbins's 1974 ''Goldberg Variations'' and the last night of ''Carnival of the Animals,'' which brings back the actor John Lithgow in the tale of a boy who spends the night at the American Museum of Natural History.  New York State Theater, Lincoln Center; 8 p.m.; $30 to $73.    EARLIER GENERATION, SAME FEAR  In 1974 -- years before Columbine -- 17-year-old Anthony Barbaro opened fire from inside his high school in Olean, N.Y., killing three and wounding nine. From his story, Bonnie Culver has fashioned ''Sniper,'' an unusual coming-of-age play set after the shooting but before the trial. ''Sniper'' has made its way from performances in Los Angeles and Red Bank, N.J.; previews begin today.  Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $15. (Through Feb. 12.)    THE ART OF ADVERTISING  If only Andy Warhol were alive to see it: ''A Consumer's Guide to Times Square Advertising,'' a new project by the New York artist Christine Hill. The pamphlet, in the form of a hand-held wheel chart, will be distributed by cigarette girls throughout Times Square today. In addition, guided tours of our beacons of product promotion will depart from the Times Square Information Center at 1560 Seventh Avenue (between 46th and 47th Streets) at 5:30 and 6:30 p.m. today.  Noon to 3 p.m., 5 to 7 p.m.    INSIDER ARTIST  Ray LaMontagne is being acclaimed as a hot new outsider crooner (he lives in Maine, not Brooklyn, and worked in a shoe factory, not a Starbucks), but unlike so many other artists who tout their wrong-side-of-the-tracks origins, he sings ballads with a radio-friendly appeal. And even within the heavily trodden territory of country soul, his rough and Otis Reddingish voice stands out.  Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side; 8 p.m.; $15.    THURSDAY 1|20    FROM BULGARIA WITH LOVE  An American engineer goes to Bulgaria in the 1920's and disappears. But even after the newspapers back home report his presumed death, his daughter continues to receive his packages, stuffed with exotic travel tales. ''Lyubo,'' a theater and dance piece by Chris Green, is accompanied by a score for piano, tubas and two singers -- and, by the way, is performed entirely by puppets.  Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village; 8:30 p.m.; $20. (Through Jan. 30.)    OLD PHANTOM, NEW MUSIC  Three silent films in three nights with very special accompaniment: on Wednesday Richard Marriott and the Club Foot Orchestra perform a new score -- with gamelan -- for the 1935 silent film ''Legong: Dance of the Virgins.'' Tonight the orchestra takes on Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 film ''Battleship Potemkin.'' And on Friday, a very different ''Phantom of the Opera'' -- Rupert Julian's 1925 version -- is matched with the world premiere of Mr. Marriott's score.  World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan; 7 p.m.; free.    VISITING DANCERS  Zephyr Dance, a 15-year-old company of female dancers based in Chicago, makes its second trip to New York. Its 90-minute program brings two pieces from repertory and two debuts, including ''Chewing,'' an abstract exploration of food and its pleasures and pains.  Mulberry Street Theater, 70 Mulberry Street, Chinatown; 8 p.m.; $15, $10 students. (Also on Friday and Saturday.)    FRIDAY 1|21    DOCTOR KATZ  The painter Alex Katz, master of the flat face and perhaps the last of the Pop artists, subjects himself to audience questions after his public talk tonight with David Cohen, who is the art critic for The New York Sun. Mr. Katz opens a new exhibition at the University of South Florida, Tampa, this week.  Ise Culture Foundation, 555 Broadway, between Prince and Spring Streets, SoHo; 6:30 p.m.; $5.    MOVIES THIS WEEKEND: MILK AND HONEY  New in independent film: In ''Head-On'' (at the Angelika Film Center), two Turkish Germans marry to appease the bride's conservative family; strangely enough, the match creates conflict. ''Watermarks'' (at the Quad Cinema), a documentary, interviews the female swimmers of Hakoah, a Jewish sports association, who fled Austria in 1938. Though the surviving members are now in their 80's, the film finds them still in the pool.  Angelika Film Center, Mercer and Houston Streets, Greenwich Village. Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village.    OUR TIME  Our Time Theater Company is made up of teenagers who stutter; it is intended as a haven from the fast-paced and shaming world that stutterers often face. This weekend three one-acts that they wrote and directed will be performed by professional actors.  Theater 3, 311 West 43rd Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $10. (Through next Sunday.)    AND YET MORE VISITING DANCERS  Alonzo King's company from San Francisco, Lines Ballet, brings a new work, ''Before the Blues,'' which is set to music by Pharoah Sanders. The piece is more allusive than narrative, but distinctly taps images of slavery, the Civil War and the history of black men in America.  Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village; 8 p.m.; $20 to $40, $12 for New York University students. (Through next Sunday.)    SATURDAY 1|22    BEDSIDE VENOM  The nonprofit White Horse Theater Company has been plowing its way through the works of Sam Shepard. The latest installment, ''The Late Henry Moss'' (the original production of which was captured in the 2003 documentary ''This So-Called Disaster: Sam Shepard Directs the Late Henry Moss''), plunks two nasty brothers at their father's deathbed in a shack.  Creative Place Theater, 750 Eighth Avenue, near 47th Street; 8 p.m.; $15. (Through Feb. 6.)    CALLING ALL VESPAS  For the mods: the Pietasters, the Supervillains, the Toasters, the Drastics and a whole mess of other bands put on three floors of ska music at the Knitting Factory tonight. Expect the pegged pants and parkas of the 80's to be on widespread display.  74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa; 7:30 p.m.; $17, $15 in advance.    THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CANAL  The Perry Street Theater reopens after nearly a decade in the dark for previews of ''Shylock.'' Written and played by Gareth Armstrong, a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, ''Shylock'' takes on Shakespeare's most controversial Jewish role. The performance works as either an antidote or a counterpoint to the current cinematic release of ''The Merchant of Venice,'' starring Al Pacino.  31 Perry Street, West Village; 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.; $55.

Their sound is integrated and sure-footed, a picture of expressive unanimity. The highlight of Friday's program was the Brahms Quintet in F minor, with Wu Han at the piano. Ensemble between strings and piano was tentative at first, but climactic passages of the third and fourth movements barreled along with symphonic force. It suddenly struck this listener how much the stretto of the last movement influenced the \\"Rondo Burlesque\\" of Mahler's Ninth Symphony.

More than that, as the City Ballet is demonstrating in its Balanchine Celebration at the New York State Theater, this choreographic chameleon could take on several different stylistic colorations in a single season.   The program on Thursday night featured four works that had their premieres in the season from November 1957 to January 1958: \\"Square Dance,\\" \\"Agon,\\" \\"Gounod Symphony\\" and \\"Stars and Stripes.\\" All four are plotless.

Although it is set to music by an Italian composer, this piece has often reminded dancegoers of the works of August Bournonville, the 19th-century Danish choreographer who is celebrated for the speed and lightness of his steps. The movements Balanchine devised for \\"Donizetti Variations\\" are equally airy, and the piece received a buoyant performance by a cast in which the male star was the Danish-born Nikolaj Hubbe.
