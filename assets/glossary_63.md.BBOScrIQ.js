There's a museum mustiness in the treatment of native peoples in films, an approach that tends toward over-reverent, one-dimensional characterizations, predictable story lines and nostalgia for the good old days of an Eden before European contact. From \\"F Troop\\" to the more recent well-intentioned but stultifying TNT cable network movies honoring native people past and present, Hollywood Indians generally lack the vibrancy and immediacy of flesh and blood human beings. They stand for ideas rather than have them on their own. \\n\\n     \\"Grand Avenue,\\" an HBO \\"original drama event\\" that has its premiere tonight at 8, does not avoid all of the genre's pitfalls, but it takes a giant step toward offering a gritty and unsparing depiction of contemporary urban Indian life. Based upon Greg Sarris's stunning 1995 collection of interrelated short stories of the same title -- and adapted by Mr. Sarris -- the three-hour presentation turns a reverse telescope on a situation that's invisible to most Americans but a reality for approximately half of this nation's 2.2 million Indians.

In the picture, Sampson, the father, is sitting cross-legged on the ground and smiling -- it seems genuinely -- at the photographer. The little girl, Frances Louise, is standing in moccasins and playing impishly to the camera. The mother, Leah, kneeling, looks relaxed.         Ms. Lippard immediately doubted her own \\"deep attraction to this quiet little picture.\\" She realized, she writes in the exhibition catalogue, that the picture was posed, the photographer was \\"a prosperous 'modern' person at 'play' in the fields of the conquered\\" and that she herself, a white woman who writes about contemporary art, may have been taken in by the happy scene.

A1    Five marines were killed and 11 wounded in an ambush at a farmhouse while hunting for insurgents in Iraq, Marine officials said. It was the deadliest day for the Marines since a sweep began along the Euphrates River near the Syrian border early this month.    A14    An Echo of Issues Nixon Faced  The Nixon administration wrestled with issues that eerily parallel problems facing the Bush administration, previously classified documents released by the National Archives show.    A1    Mexico Strengthens Rape Law  The Supreme Court of Mexico ruled that rape within marriage is a crime, removing one of the many obstacles women in Mexico face in reporting rape.    A3    Clues to a Civilization's Fall  Archaeologists in Guatemala discovered 50 skeletons among the ruins of an ancient Maya city, victims of murder in a war that destroyed the city and, it seems, served as a beginning of the collapse of the classic period of the Maya civilization.

A20    Nominee Debate Intensifies  The debate over the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Samuel A.

The Game 1 starter Matt Clement and the Game 2 starter David Wells both posted earned run averages over 4.40 this season. But Clement has enough movement on his pitches and Wells enough experience in playoff situations to still maneuver around Chicago's unimposing lineup.    WHITE SOX  At various times this season, Chicago has worked with four different aces. José Contreras has been perhaps the best starting pitcher in baseball during the second half of the season, just as Mark Buehrle and Jon Garland were among the best in the first half. Throw in Freddy Garcia and it may not matter that the White Sox are still looking for a consistent closer.    HITTING    RED SOX  The best-hitting team in baseball is anchored by David Ortiz, but often depends on Manny Ramirez. When Ortiz and Ramirez are slugging in sync, Boston has the strength to bash its way to another World Series championship. The White Sox knew they would have to contend with Ortiz, but they have to be concerned that Ramirez rediscovered his power stroke late in the regular season.    WHITE SOX  Perhaps more important than Chicago's hitting is its running. The White Sox do not accumulate runs so much as they manufacture them, often one at a time. The more of a high-scoring series this becomes, the less of a chance they have. Chicago is best in close games when a key stolen base or sacrifice fly makes all the difference.    FIELDING    RED SOX  First baseman John Olerud has stabilized an often inconsistent defense, but Boston can still let games slip through its fingers. Shortstop Edgar Renteria has not supplied the handiwork the Red Sox expected. Manny Ramirez remains an adventure in the outfield. So much for the notion that pitching and defense win: Boston is ranked third to last in the American League in fielding and fourth to last in pitching.    WHITE SOX  Center fielder Aaron Rowand and third baseman Joe Crede have helped turn Chicago into an above-average defensive team that perfectly complements its stellar pitching staff. The White Sox understand that they can't allow many runs because they don't score many runs. Unlike Boston, Chicago does win with pitching and defense, a formula that netted an American League-best 99 victories this season.    X-FACTOR    RED SOX  Regardless of Edgar Renteria's struggles in Boston, he is known as a clutch post-season performer who delivers when the stakes are highest. He supplied the winning hit in Game 7 of the 1997 World Series with Florida and made some of the most important plays in the National League Championship Series last season when he was with St. Louis.    WHITE SOX  Ozzie Guillen's style is such that at some point in this series, he will do something to make an impact. Guillen, Chicago's outspoken manager, has been unafraid to make controversial decisions and unexpected public comments. More often than not, his moves have motivated the White Sox, and this stage is too significant for him to sit idly by.
