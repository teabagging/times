This includes a device (pictured) that knocks a playing card out from under a ball that stays in place, demonstrating the principle of inertia. ''It's less messy than the tablecloth version of the trick,'' says Fred Winkler, a physicist who is team-teaching with Ken Pohlman, a designer at the Middlebury College Museum of Art, which will display the exhibit.    EDUCATIONAL VALUE -- The course will ask: Where did these instruments come from, who built them, using what materials? What is the science that was being taught with them? Students will also learn how to ''get a simple idea across, without insulting the expert while educating the layman,'' Mr. Pohlman says. And they will master ''how to write a label.''

A tireless, effective Trustee for the Central Park Conservancy, he was proud of being part of and seeing the renaissance of Central Park; as recognition of his efforts, he was made a Life Trustee. He was a benefactor and member of the corporation of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He was president of the International Center of Photography during an important period of its development; and because of the results, he was made an Honorary Trustee. Born in Sioux City, Iowa to Aaron and Lena Halpern, who had emigrated from Russia, his family finally settled in Los Angeles. Graduating from Theodore Roosevelt High School, he was a top student as well as the basketball scoring leader for the City of Los Angeles. Receiving a scholarship to University of Southern California, he graduated in 1936 with Phi Beta Kappa honors, as well as being a member of three Pacific Conference champion basketball teams. He then came east to Harvard Law School where he was a member and Treasurer of the Law Review. To help with the publication's finances, he developed the idea of publishing volumes of previous years' editions and selling them to interested professionals--a successful venture. Upon graduation, he went as a young lawyer to Washington, D.C. as Assistant to the Chairman of the SEC. While working with the SEC he was given an additional duty to assist in the drafting of the Lend Lease. Then served as Executive Assistant to the Director of WPB 1941-42. During WWII as a Navy Officer, he became Executive Assistant to James Forrestal. Seeking an active role overseas, he became part of the Office of Strategic Services. He participated in the planning of D-Day in London. Executive Assistant to Director of US Information Services (France), he went behind German lines in Belgium and later had duties that brought him all the way through and behind the lines of the advancing Russian troops to start negotiating repatriation of whole populations in Europe. In the course of his OSS assignments, he met William S. Paley, President of CBS and some of the people who worked for him. After the war, he went to work for CBS from 1945-49, becoming Assistant to Mr. Paley during the period. As he learned more about the new medium of television. he developed an innovative concept of closed circuit television--the ''special origination, distribution and display of television to a special audience.'' He left CBS to form his own company. His work over the next 45 years included the first pay-TV events televised live to theatre audiences; the first satellite television telecasts to Europe (Telstar), Japan and China; ten national political conventions in which he was part of changing the entire nature of the televised event through new staging of the rostrum, preparing speakers for TV and special TV presentations for the audience; providing new national private network TV marketing communication for major US companies; designing and providing the high resolution large screen TV technology which NASA used for management of its rocket launches as well as extensive application for all the images from the moon during Apollo 11; breakthrough medical television techniques with live broadcasts from hospitals into major medical meetings involving patient case histories, treatment techniques and live surgeries; many of the biggest sports events and concerts; major meetings of associations, religious denominations, corporations; flight simulator displays and air traffic control. He loved East Hampton and the beach. He became a founding member and president of the East Hampton Beach Preservation Society and, true to form, became an expert as he researched the facts on beaches and erosion/ build up patterns. He was an avid landscaper and tree planter and created a beautiful environment at his home. A voracious reader, a fine eye and appreciation for art and a collector in various categories, a punster, he swam in the ocean and shot baskets regularly until age 85. He is predeceased by Edith, his loving wife of 63 years. He is survived by his son Michael, daughter-in-law Chris Grant and two grandsons. Funeral arrangements were private.

Going through ersatz Beatle songs, and jokes and motions, their complete lack of distinction of any kind—the fact that fame was stamped on them by hucksters as it might have been on any nice four random, utterly undistinguished boys—makes their performance modest and almost brave. They work very hard and they aren't any good. This keeps them less distant from their own special fans than the Beatles or, say, Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys are. They do not have to bridge the distance of talent or style.There are some funny moments—an old joke about a regiment of Italian soldiers surrendering to a single man, a policeman posing girlishly before a mirror, a scene in which the boys are cast as dandruff in the hair of a giant Victor Mature, a war scene in which Ray Nitschke of the Green Bay Packers keeps senselessly tackling a G.

Nothing seems to be left out: folktales and traditional religious beliefs, the practical uses of plants and minerals and the daily flow of life in field and village.   But it is more than the content that makes the book a remarkable publishing event, for Mr. Salinas is neither a professional anthropologist nor a literary stylist. He is, though, the first person to write a book in Nahnu (NYAW-hnyu), the native tongue of several hundred thousand Indians but a previously unwritten language.   Such a use of microcomputers and desktop publishing for languages with no literary tradition is now being encouraged by anthropologists for recording ethnographies from an insider's perspective. They see this as a means of preserving cultural diversity and a wealth of human knowledge. With even greater urgency, linguists are promoting the techniques as a way of saving some of the world's languages from imminent extinction.    Half of the world's 6,000 languages are considered by linguists to be endangered. These are the languages spoken by small societies that are dwindling with the encroachment of larger, more dynamic cultures. Young people feel economic pressure to learn only the language of the dominant culture, and as the older people die, the non-written language vanishes, unlike languages with a history of writing, like Latin.   Dr. H. Russell Bernard, the anthropologist at the University of Florida at Gainesville who taught Mr. Salinas to read and write his native language, said: \\"Languages have always come and gone. Neither the language of Jesus nor that of Caesar are spoken today. But languages seem to be disappearing faster than ever before.\\"   In 30 years of field studies, Dr. Kenneth Hale, a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a leader in efforts to preserve endangered languages, said he had worked with at least eight that have become extinct and many others that are \\"seriously imperiled.\\"   Dr. Michael E. Krauss, the director of the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, estimates that 300 of the 900 indigenous languages in the Americas are moribund. That is, they are no longer being spoken by children, and so could disappear in a generation or two. Only two of the 20 native languages in Alaska are still being learned by children.   \\"Languages no longer being learned as mother-tongue by children are beyond endangerment,\\" Dr. Krauss said. Unless the current course is somehow reserved, he added, these languages \\"are already doomed to extinction, like species lacking reproductive capacity.\\"   Dr. Krauss asks: \\"Should we mourn the loss of Eyak or Ubykh any less than the loss of the panda or California condor?\\"   At a symposium a few years ago in Mexico on \\"The Politics of Linguistic Revitalization,\\" representatives of Latin American Indians passed a resolution saying, \\"The loss of a language in the world means the disappearance of the cultural heritage transmitted by it, and the truncation of an alternate route of cultural development for humankind.\\"   In an effort to preserve language diversity in Mexico, Dr. Bernard and Mr. Salinas decided in 1987 on a plan to teach the Indian people to read and write their own languages using microcomputers. They established a native literacy center in Oaxaca, Mexico, where others could follow in the footsteps of Mr. Salinas and write books in other Indian languages.   The Oaxaca center goes beyond most bilingual education programs, which concentrate on teaching people to speak and read their native languages. Instead, it operates on the premise that, as Dr. Bernard decided, what most native languages lack is native authors who write books in their own languages.   \\"Without popular literacy, all but a few endangered languages will soon disappear,\\" Dr. Bernard said.\\"And when non-written languages disappear, they disappear forever.\\"   Mr. Salinas set the example. He had grown up speaking both Spanish and Nahnu, one of the more widely spoken of the 56 Indian languages in Mexico. The Nahnu Indians are also known as the Otomi, a name they now reject because of its pejorative connotations in Mexican Spanish.   While conducting research in Mexico in the 1970's, Dr. Bernard taught Mr. Salinas to read and write the Nahnu language, using a modified version of an alphabet that had been developed by missionaries. The Summer Institute of Linguistics, a worldwide evangelical Protestant organization based in Dallas, has for decades developed the alphabets for hundreds of Indian languages.   Virtually all indigenous languages now have rudimentary writing systems, including alphabets, a dictionary and some grammar. In Nahnu and many other languages, however, the only book is a Bible translation.   Next Dr. Bernard adapted computer software for writing Nahnu on a word processor and for printing manuscripts and books, which would not have been affordable through traditional publishing. In this way, Mr. Salinas first produced a book of Nahnu folktales and, two years ago, his magnum opus on Nahnu culture. A translation in English, by Dr. Bernard, is entitled, \\"Native Ethnography: A Mexican Indian Describes His Culture.\\"  As-Told-to Autobiographies    He wrote of the trapping and cooking of squirrels, which many people still believe were first human beings who sinned and so are symbols of bad luck","excerpt":"the uses of the mineral lime in medicine ( for burning off warts) and in making tortillas and cooking vegetables; the arrival of foreigners, as remembered in oral histories; rituals of passage; music, and local fiestas.   There is a long tradition of training people of a remote culture to be what anthropologists call informants. These people would describe the legends and customs and sometimes dictate their autobiographies. But these were usually taped interviews with an anthropologist and not the direct work of an indigenous person.   At the Oaxaca center, run by Mr. Salinas, Indians spend up to three months learning the technology for producing works in their previously nonwritten languages. They are mostly bilingual schoolteachers, such as Mixtecs learning to use a Mixtec-Spanish word processor. Josefa Gonzalez, the wife of Mr. Salinas, is a Mixtec Indian who is writing her own book on Mixtec culture.   The center is supported by the Jessie Ball du Pont Foundation and sponsored by Mexico's Ministry of Education, the Inter-American Indian Institute of the Organization of American States, the Center for Advanced Studies in Social Anthropology in Oaxaca and the University of Florida at Gainesville.    So far, the Oaxaca authors have produced works in Chatino, Amuzgo, Chinantec and Mazatec, as well as Nahnu and Mixtec. Other books in Tzotzil and Zapotec are in the works. In every case, the trainees wrote directly in their own languages, using word processors with specially developed computer programs. Such microcomputer technology is available at relatively low cost, Dr. Bernard said, \\"so that virtually every nonliterate people of the world can develop their own machine-readable data bank about their own culture, and can have their own independent publishing capability in support of native ethnography.\\"   The Oaxaca project's influence is spreading. Impressed by the work of Mr. Salinas and others, Dr. Norman Whitten, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois, arranged for schoolteachers from Ecuador to visit Oaxaca and learn the techniques.    Now Ecuadorian Indians have begun writing about their cultures in the Quichua and Shwara languages. Others from Bolivia and Peru are learning to use the computers to write their languages, including Quecha, the tongue of the ancient Incas, still spoken by about 12 million Andean Indians.   Anthropologists in Cameroon have introduced the technology in that African country of more than 200 tribal languages. At the end of a two-week training course, Dr. Bernard said, each of the five speakers of the Kom language would turn on the computer in the morning and start typing Kom without hesitation. Anything they could say, they could write.   Dr. Bernard emphasized that these native literacy programs are not intended to discourage people from learning the dominant language of their country as well. \\"I see nothing useful or charming about remaining monolingual in any Indian language if that results in being shut out of the national economy,\\" he said.    Anthropologists acknowledge that bilingualism can be a sensitive political issue. In places strugging to create a workable nation, the preservation of separate languages can be seen as potentially divisive, setting one group against another.   But anthropologists and leaders of native cultures generally favor bilingualism because it preserves a distinctive culture, which often gives the people more power than if they were completely assimilated. A distinctive language can be a strong force in establishing cultural uniqueness, or ethnicity, which in turn can reinforce a group's claim to a share of power.    Such efforts may be too late for hundreds of languages and dwindling cultures, anthropologists and linguists say, but in time to help preserve some of the cultural heterogeneity of the planet.

In the late 1970's President Carter proposed a huge immunization initiative that, combined with intensive Federal efforts to end a big outbreak, all but erased measles. By 1983 there were fewer than 1,500 cases throughout the nation.   The figure was never again that low. During the Reagan years, the price of vaccine went up and Federal funding for childhood immunization went down. In 1987 Congress pushed for, and got, more money for the programs -- but it was too little and too late. In 1989 there were 18,000 cases of this highly contagious disease, with 40 deaths. In 1990 there were about 25,000, with at least 60 deaths. Two months into 1991 a Philadelphia health official has declared an epidemic, and New Jersey, with at least 118 cases, has declared a state of emergency.   Most measles deaths are from encephalitis and pneumonia, occasional consequences of the disease","excerpt":"the usual victims are infants and toddlers. The majority of 5-year-olds are vaccinated. It's mandatory for public school entrance, unless parents claim a health or religious exemption. But far too many little kids are slipping through the cracks.    To stop the slippage, the Department of Health and Human Services' special committee on vaccines has offered several sound suggestions, most of which could be funded by President Bush's request for a $40 million increase in childhood immunization programs. It's now up to Congress to make reparations for the callousness of a Reagan Administration that, in its eagerness to save money on social services, literally revived a disease.

He emphasized, however, that the conference is an open forum to which every American interested in the cause of wildlife restoration is invited.Plans for the formation of a national federation of wildlife interests are taking shape rapidly, according to word from Washington. This organization—chief objective of the conference—is being furthered by a new ally, the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce, which has undertaken the important task of federating the various groups within the several States.Mr. Silcox pointed out that proposals to be presented at the meeting deal with matters which, if effectively handled, would show favorably on the account books of the nation to the extent of many hundreds of millions of dollars annually. In this connection, one item alone, that of water pollution, costs the United States $1,000,000,000 a year.Other economic factors in striving for an adequate wildlife population include the value of fur resources, running into millions of dollars annually","excerpt":"the valuable fish resources, the benefit to sporting goods, clothing, automotive and other industries, and, of course, the inestimable recreational, educational and social values.The main sessions of the conference will be held in the Labor Department auditorium, while concurrent scientific sessions will be conducted in the Mayflower Hotel, where motion pictures, panoramas and other exhibits will serve to present in graphic form the need for immediate action if the remaining wildlife resources are not to go the way of American species already extinct.New Anglers Body Formed.Notes on club activities: A new organization, the Nassau Anglers Guild, composed of sport fishermen, commercial fishermen and private and charter boatmen, has been formed in Freeport, L.

I am concerned about my status as far as the board is concerned. Does my ownership have to be approved by the board of directors? . . . Ellen Stern, Manhattan Answer: No. According to Marc Luxemburg, the president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, as a general rule of law, you would have the right to become the owner of the shares. But occupancy rights would depend on the terms of the co-op's proprietary leases.    \\"In most proprietary leases,\\" said Mr. Luxemburg, \\"there is a clause that addresses the issue of occupancy rights in the case of the death of a shareholder. Most leases give automatic occupancy rights to spouses but require board approval of anyone else. Other leases include automatic approval for adult children and siblings.\\"   If you intend to live in the apartment, and the lease does not give you the automatic right of occupancy, you would probably have to meet the same requirements as an outside buyer. If by chance you were not approved by the board, and if the board does not allow apartments to be owned by nonresident investors, you would probably have to sell the apartment. Subletting Question: I rent a stabilized apartment on a two-year sublease. The tenant lives in Chicago now and is about to give up the lease. Do I have any rights to the lease and would I have to pay an agent's fee to keep it? . . .Jenny Hill, Manhattan Answer: The answer to both questions is \\"no.\\" According to the rules for rent-stabilized apartments, the landlord would have no obligation to offer you a lease. If he does, however, it would be against the law for him, his management company or any other agent to charge a fee for the lease.  Calculating Gains Tax Question: A house in Evanston, Ill., was transfered to me in a divorce settlement in 1976. At the time, it was not appraised. I sold the house last August and I now need to compute a capital gains tax. Would I need to have the increase in value from the end of 1976 to August of 1990 to fullfill the requirements? . . . Ruth Marcus, New Haven Answer: No. According to Neil O'Keefe, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, the appraised value at the time of transfer is not pertinent. You would not need to have it to calculate the taxes owed on any capital gain on the sale. The figures you would need are the purchase price","excerpt":"the value of any capital improvements made over the years; legal fees, brokerage commissions and other costs of selling the house and the sale price.    For example, if you and your former husband bought the house for $100,000 and spent $25,000 for improvements, then the basis at the time of sale would be $125,000. If you then sold the house for $200,000, capital gains taxes would be calculated on the difference between $200,000 and the basis of $125,000, less any selling costs you incurred.    If you are putting the profit toward the purchase of another prime residence, I.R.S. regulations require that you defer the tax payment and apply the gain toward the new purchase. And if you are 55 or older, you can claim the once-in-a-lifetime exclusion of $125,000 from your profit.

And that is the riddle presented by the latest Gallic import, \\"The Kiss of Fire,\\" which arrived yesterday at the Little Carnegie. For one-half or two-thirds of its length it looks for all the world like an old-fashioned sex drama in which a particularly scorchy vamp lures a fellow away from his affianced and also leads him to betray his best and trusting pal. And then, along toward the end, it all goes slightly daffy","excerpt":"the vamp starts flinging herself at other men with ludicrous abandon, and the fellow, his girl and his pal are reconciled without any recriminations.But whatever the producers' intentions, it is all pretty funny none the less. For Viviane Romance is as frank and reckless a doxy as ever rolled a wicked eye; Michel Simon is ponderously amusing as the friend who is done wrong by, and Tino Rossi is downright killing as a slick-haired cafe singer who lists to the siren's song. If a somewhat lighter touch had been applied to the earlier part of the film—if the breath of Miss Romance had been less obviously torrid and the love songs of Mr. Rossi had betrayed but a slight note of humor—\\"The Kiss of Fire\\" might have been truly comic.

Perhaps it is not cinema that has ended but only cinephilia -- the name of the very specific kind of love that cinema inspired. Each art breeds its fanatics. The love that cinema inspired, however, was special. It was born of the conviction that cinema was an art unlike any other: quintessentially modern; distinctively accessible; poetic and mysterious and erotic and moral -- all at the same time.

Curated by Joseph T. Butler, director of museum operations for Historic Hudson Valley, the exhibition is titled \\"It's Time for Tea.\\" It traces the development of the drink from ancient times, when it was deemed to have medicinal benefits, to today.    Numerous galleries, antiques dealers, private collectors and museums, including Lyndhurst and Historic Hudson Valley, have contributed items to the display. These include an 18th-century Queen Anne tea table, a 13th-century celadon porcelain tea bowl and early 18th-century Chinese porcelain tea caddy. A selection of photographs includes one from the early 1900's of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney dressed in a kimono, drinking tea and playing a Japanese musical instrument.    Mr. Butler will give a free lecture April 24 at 8 P.M., called \\"The Serving of Tea and Its Equipage.\\" And the museum shop will have for sale at $20.95 a tea-garden kit containing a cedar window box, soil and seeds for spearmint, peppermint and balsam teas.    The museum, at 937 White Plains Post Road, is open Wednesdays through Fridays from 1:30 to 4:30 P.M. and Saturdays and Sundays from 2 to 4:30 P.M.

MAKING BUNNIES     Gigi Carnes, historical interpreter for the Washington's Headquarters Museum in North Castle, will hold a free two-day adult workshop on Easter bunnies. Today and Saturday from 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. she will help participants make 14-inch bunnies with floppy ears.    The body will be made today, sewn by hand from materials from home. These include one-quarter of a yard of muslin, enough polyfill to stuff a healthy-looking bunny, needles, thread and scissors.    On Saturday Ms. Carnes will help make a dress with a full gathered skirt trimmed with lace, ruffles and whatever the maker wishes to supply. Doll-sized shoes, hats, purses and \\"any sign of creativity is encouraged,\\" Ms. Carnes said.    Because of her adherence to the traditions of the 18th-century museum, no sewing machines will be used. And Ms. Carne will not draw a face on her demonstration bunny. \\"The model is based on a rather austere Amish stuffed rabbit, but it's very sweet, and anyone who wants a face may do one,\\" she said.    The museum is on Virginia Road in North White Plains in the town of North Castle, reached from Route 22. Call 949-1236 for more information. TWO NATURE OUTINGS     Two somewhat unusual nature outings for familes have been scheduled free of charge by the County Parks Department.   Today at 2 P.M.

Spring is their mating time and their peeping calls make it possible to find and observe the otherwise elusive amphibians. Wear waterproof boots and take a flashlight.    The reservation is at the junction of Routes 35 and 121, off Exit 6 of I-684. Parking on the grounds costs $5.50. For more information, call 763-3993. PRE-COLUMBIAN TEXTILES     Opening Monday and continuing through June 9 at the White Plains Public Library is an exhibition of pre-Columbian textiles from Peru. Woven on looms, mostly by women, the materials were used for religious ceremonies and burials as well as for functional purposes. Those that were buried in tombs along the desert coast of the country were preserved, still brilliant in color and with intricate woven patterns intact.    They were made of cotton and wool from the alpaca, dyed with minerals and vegetables, and embellished with feathers, gold, silver and human hair.   The library at 100 Martine Avenue is open Mondays through Thursdays from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M., Fridays from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M., Saturdays from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M.

The impotence of authority was a persistent theme in the post-war satires made at Ealing Studios, some of which can be seen at the Museum of Modern Art until Feb. 5. (The series, which surveys the career of producer Michael Balcon, also includes a number of Ealing's straight dramatic films.) Emerging from the sense of oppression imposed by wartime austerity, rationing, and the disciplines necessary to winning a war, British audiences welcomed Ealing's small ballads of rebellion, and many were extremely popular here. While critics and historians frequently referred to the ''anarchy'' that permeates such movies as ''Passport to Pimlico'' and ''The Lavender Hill Mob,'' the films are hardly insurrectionary; instead, they convey the delights of challenging the boss and out-foxing his functionaries.

The endlessly fascinating psychological and moral shadings of the piece vanish with Vienna, but the comic interludes, which are usually neglected in weightier stagings, have rarely been funnier.

Even the dullest laggard in the class is quite certain to perk up when he hears Lou Novikoff perform in masterly fashion upon a harmonica in the Chicago Cub dugout.As usual, the picture is mainly of an educational nature, and with the constant improvement in camera technique the various phases of baseball's technical plays are more clearly portrayed than ever before.Star Hurlers Seen in ActionParticularly is this true of the pitching, which shows such renowned hurlers as Whitlow Wyatt, Bucky Walters, Paul Derringer, Curt Davis, Carl Hubbell, Mort Cooper and Freddie Fitzsimmons going through their paces under the microscopic eye of the slow-motion camera.Incidentally, the magazine expert who last Summer thought he had hit upon something new when he exploited the idea that there is no such thing as a \\"curve ball\\" may have to revise his observations when he sees big Derringer unfurl a few of his magical sharp-breaking hooks.Behind the plate a bevy of National League catchers, headed by Al Lopez and Ken O'Dea, give invaluable tips on how to work on the receiving end, while Infielders Peewee Reese, Cookie Lavagetto, Babe Young, Billy Herman, Eddie Miller and Marty Marion and Out-fielders Terry Moore, Pete Reiser and Jimmy Gleeson also contribute pointers on the game's defensive play.MacPhail Pays AttentionThe art of bunting is superbly portrayed by its present-day exponents, such as Johnny Rucker, Chet Ross, Eddie Joost and Danny Litwhiler.Larry MacPhail, head man of the Dodgers, was seen to take particular notice when Litwhiler was flashed on the screen, inasmuch as rumor has it that the Philly out-fielder is one ball player definitely set to drop into the Brooklyn dragnet when the trade winds blow at the minor league conventions in Jacksonville next week.The fleet-footed Johnny Hopp","excerpt":"the veteran, though still agile, Stan Hack; Joe Orengo and Arky Vaughan demonstrate their skill as base-runners and even the umpires are not overlooked. Jocko Conlan, Al Barlick, George Barr, Ziggy Sears and Lou Jorda all get a chance to let the fans in on what happens during those absorbing plate conferences before a game gets under way.Then there is Casey Stengel, manager of the Boston Braves, who shows how major-league pilots are interviewed by the press. When asked by an inquiring reporter who will win the pennant, he gives a typical answer. He looks at his watch and invites his questioners to accompany him out to Ebbets Field to see his Braves play the Dodgers.Series Highlights ShownAlthough strictly a National League picture, Director Allen fearlessly plunges into the scenes of the late lamented world series to give the highlights of each of the five games in that classic which saw the Dodgers bow to the Yankees of the American League. Manager Leo Durocher of the vanquished Brooklyn Flock breaks in on the screen here long enough to shake hands with Manager Joe McCarthy.Red Barber, the Brooklyn broadcaster, does the narrating and in addition to Novikoff's harmonious harmonica selection more music of a sort is provided by those doughty musicians known as the Dodger Band.As in the past, the film will be available to all schools, colleges and fraternal organizations as well as military posts. Bookings can be made through the eight National League club offices, the National League Film Bureau at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York; the Burton Holmes Films, Inc., Chicago, and The San Francisco Chronicle.Broadcasts to ContinueThe baseball games of the Dodgers, both at Ebbets Field and on the road, will again be broadcast during the 1942 season, according to announcement made yesterday by Secretary John McDonald. The contract was signed earlier in the day by MacPhail and the J. Walter Thompson Advertising Agency, representing the new sponsor, P. Lorillard Company.This will mark the fourth successive season that the Dodger games have been put on the air. Red Barber again will be the chief broadcaster.

The defendant, 18-year-old Steven Todd Jenkins, was found guilty last week in the murders last fall of two bankers who foreclosed on his family's farm near here four years ago. Rudolph H.

Their bank had been trying to sell the overgrown 10-acre plot since it was repossessed in 1980. Steven Jenkins and his father, James, led authorities on a three-day flight to Texas, where the father apparently committed suicide and the son turned himself in.

It is stuffed with extraneous absurdities and all the characters are as mad as the proverbial March hare. Colleen Moore, as Lady Rutfield, is permitted to pull the wool over the eyes of other people and the title writer has seen to it that captions attached to the different scenes of this trifle are well-seasoned with puns. This yarn begins with relative restraint, but after Lady Kay lands in America from a rum-running schooner the pot of farce boils over.Lady Kay objects to marrying a noble fool and therefore she seeks an adventure in her little sailboat. A wicked storm blows up and the mast of Lady Kay's craft crashes overboard. The instant after it happens, the director, Mervyn LeRoy, arranges that the ocean shall be nice and calm, but so that the excitement will not abate he sees to it that Lady Kay's boat bursts out in flames. When Lady Kay is in the water hanging to a rope, she is beheld by the crew of a rum-runner, but the captain is opposed to rescuing the girl. The mate, however, a man with a heart, bellows to the captain:\\"I've left many a girl standing on the corner, but I won't leave one in mid-ocean.\\"This gallant remark is enough to awaken a soft spot in the captain's bosom and the girl is brought aboard the schooner. Then it becomes a question as to whether the captain shall turn back to collect the reward offered by Lady Kay's father for the return of his daughter or continue on his westerly course to dispose of his \\"$250,000 worth of American headaches.\\" One thought of the precious liquor and the skipper decides to keep on for New York.In an old mansion Lady Kay has a hectic time, for she meets Jimmy Winter, owner of the house, where the rum runners have been pleased to store their cargo during Mr. Winter's absence. Mr. Winter evidently rather likes the doll-eyed, dark-haired girl. Her conduct is queer, but so is that of everybody else.In one sequence, Lady Kay, posing as Hortense Higgs, a maid, throws dishes filled with food about the room, instead of putting them on the table and then, on calming down, she sets before Mr. Winter's prospective father-in-law a glass of water with a goldfish in it. From then on, while you may know that hi-jackers and bootleggers are going to have their inning and that Lady Kay will eventually marry Mr. Winter, you really have no idea of the senseless things some characters will do when they try to carry out the story.The adaptation is credited to Elsie Janis.So far as the performances are concerned one might cover them all by saying \\"Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.\\"There is a Movietone of Governor Smith making his recent Albany acceptance speech and another of Herbert C. Hoover speaking at West Branch, Iowa. The voices of both Presidential candidates are extraordinarily true.There is also a two-reel Vitaphone talking picture.

And now he has a great new music video, for ''All Time Love.'' The veteran director known as W.I.Z. cast Mr. Young as a subversive in a fascist state","excerpt":"the video unfolds at the world's most elegant show trial, with our hero gazing, brave but despondent, at the woman who betrayed him. (Watch it at will-youngonline.com/cinema/.) It's a simple ballad, well sung: a bit of piano, a lot of falsetto. The courtroom proceedings and resistance meetings are beautifully shot, but even better is an odd, inspired scene near the end: the stern, corrupt judges lead a procession down the hallway. They're protected by armed guards, and they're devouring ice cream cones.    Da Muzicianz       It seems likely that supply preceded demand: manufacturers started putting cameras in cellphones mainly because they could. Slowly, we realized the implications. No good or bad deed would ever go unphotographed again. Embarrassing images would spread even quicker than word-of-mouth. And eventually, a hip-hop group like Da Muzicianz (a Ying Yang Twins side project) would record a song like ''Camera Phone'' (TVT), encouraging photogenic revelers everywhere to ''Shake sum'n for the camera phone.'' At least these posers can't say they weren't warned.    Three 6 Mafia       With the music video for ''Poppin' My Collar,'' this great Memphis hip-hop group proves yet again that it's almost always a great idea to put little kids in rap videos. Kids make rappers seem both more immature and more grown-up; there's a pleasing implication that even hip-hop's hardest take a kindly interest in America's youth. In the ''Poppin' My Collar'' video, three children arrive, selling $5 candy bars. Apparently, when he's not composing eerie synthesizer beats or roaring wild-eyed rhymes, Juicy J is a pretty soft touch: he buys the lot, nostalgic for his own childhood. Soon the rappers have been replaced by their former selves: four exuberant kids in an S.U.V., lip-synching the swaggering lyrics.    LMC and Rachel McFarlane       Once you hear it, it makes perfect sense. A thumping beat from the production team LMC, complete with a gluey bass line that evokes Daft Punk. Brassy, gospel-inspired singing from Ms. McFarlane. And a chorus that comes straight from ''You Get What You Give,'' the 1998 New Radicals song that became a cult hit. The result, available at aatw.com/artist.php?id=148, is a euphoric (if perhaps somewhat mercenary) club favorite, based on a song that nearly everyone has heard, even if not everyone can identify it immediately. The only drawback: the famously petulant verses are sadly missed. Surely it's possible to find a danceable arrangement for the couplet ''Health-insurance ripoff lying/ F.D.A., big bankers buying.''    Cat Power       Another well-known Three 6 Mafia video showed the members drinking cough syrup out of baby bottles. In tribute (one imagines), a black man holds a baby bottle in the first scene of the video for ''Living Proof,'' the current single from Cat Power. (Visit matadorrecords.com to watch it.) The video was made by Harmony Korine, a white director who been playing with race for years. Chan Marshall, the white woman who records as Cat Power, looks pretty fetching in a pink hooded sweatshirt emblazoned with the face of Tupac Shakur. Soon she strips to a red catsuit and picks up a huge white cross, competing in a footrace against women in Muslim veils. Despite the cross (or because of it?) she finishes second; the three medalists take the podium and give a black-power salute. Like much of Mr. Korine's work, this video is provocative and vague, like an offensive dream you can't quite interpret, or shake. And throughout, there's Ms. Marshall's luminous music: a ghostly soul song, even more unshakable.    Ryoji Ikeda       For his intoxicating new CD, ''Dataplex'' (Raster-Noton, available from forcedexposure.com), this rigorous Japanese producer created a mutating series of electronic compositions. The third piece, ''data.duplex,'' sounds like the byproduct of some computational process: a faint hum, a few beeps, some ultra-trebly, flickering tones. By the time you get to the 15th piece, ''data.reflex,'' the rhythms are much more decipherable. There's a regular pulse, a propulsive syncopation; it's dance music, nearly. The 20th and final track, ''data.adaplex,'' is maximalist, in a sense. It contains ''specific waveform data'' that may disrupt your listening experience by triggering ''playback errors.'' No joke. At least one listener will never again hear this CD without thinking about a computer that had to be rebooted and a column that had to be partly rewritten.

But even when the musical results are not on such a high level -- as they were not on Wednesday night in Carnegie Hall when the orchestra began a three-concert visit here under the direction of Riccardo Muti -- there is something uncannily compelling about the organization and its sound. Though the orchestra is just a few months older than the New York Philharmonic, it actually seems an ancient ancestor.

The man holding the fuse is Lee Teng-hui, President of Taiwan, father of Taiwan's democratic reform movement and the only person in the world whose receipt of an alumni award plaque from Cornell University almost triggered a war across the Straits of Taiwan.    President Lee invited me over for an interview Friday in his office in downtown Taipei. The conversation left me both reassured and disquieted. It was reassuring because Mr. Lee is an unlikely fuse. A sober, owlish man, who weighed his words carefully, he evinced a strong grasp of the red lines that constrict Taiwan's behavior -- red lines he is certainly trying to push out but won't likely breach.

The Scheibner place is on Blue Mountain Road, a few miles past a forlorn establishment called Binnie's Hot Dogs and Family Food. Standing behind their white clapboard farmhouse, where the backyard unfurls over three and a half acres and where, in summer, you can see a tangled strawberry patch and a tree fort, you could swear you were deep in the country and maybe deep in the past too. The front of the house is a different matter. It's practically on top of a busy road that leads to the local ski resorts","excerpt":"the view is of a housing development under construction.     Inside, there is no such ambivalence. Although the Scheibners are well off and their house is comfortably appointed -- Steve is a pilot with American Airlines and a commander in the Naval Reserves -- what might strike many visitors first is what's missing. In the Scheibner household, where the children are 12, 11, 9, 7, 6, 4 and 20 months, there is no Pokemon or ''Star Wars'' paraphernalia. There are no Britney Spears or Ricky Martin tapes. There are no posters of Leonardo DiCaprio or Michael Jordan taped to the walls, no pots of lip gloss or bottles of metallic nail polish scattered around. No Mortal Kombat, no ''Goosebumps.'' No broadcast TV -- though the family does watch carefully selected videos, which often means movies from the 1940's and 50's. (The older kids are big Cary Grant fans.) There is no giggling about the cute guys and girls at school, because the Scheibners are home-schooled and besides, their parents don't believe in dating. There is little sign of eye-rolling preteen rebellion, because Steve and his wife, Megan, don't believe in that either, and have set up their lives in such a way that it is unlikely to manifest itself. Katie, the oldest, reads Louisa May Alcott and reissued girls' classics like the Elsie Dinsmore books, and is partial to white patent-leather Mary Janes worn with ankle-length floral dresses. Peter, who comes next, likes Tolkien and the muscularly Christian boys' adventure stories written by the 19th-century author G. A. Henty, and favors chinos and logo-free button-down shirts. Peter wants to be a missionary in Russia, which he describes as a ''forsaken'' country; Katie wants to be a home-schooling mom. They are each other's best friends.

Founder of Carlson Companies. Mr. Carlson died Friday, February 19, after suffering a stroke on February 10. He was 84. He retained and enjoyed an active role as company chairman until his last day. Born July 9, 1914, in Minneapolis, Mr. Carlson was recognized for his generosity, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit. Known worldwide as the ''ultra-entrepreneur'', he founded the Gold Bond Stamp Company in 1938 with a $55 loan and a desire to succeed. After World War II, the business grew dramatically. Two-thirds of American households saved stamps, and Gold Bond captured about one-third of the market. Mr. Carlson's ''Horatio Alger'' qualities were key to the continued expansion of his business, which has become one of the largest privatelyheld companies in the world. To reflect its global expansion and diversification, the corporation became Carlson Companies, Inc., in 1973. Today, Carlson Companies is an international leader in providing hospitality, travel and marketing services and solutions to corporate clients and consumers. The company operates in more than 140 countries. Its brands employ 160,000 people worldwide and generated more than $22 billion in systemwide revenues in 1998. Carlson Companies brands and services include Regent International Hotels, Radisson Hotels Worldwide, Country Inns & Suites By Carlson, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, T.G.I. Friday's restaurants, Carlson Leisure Group (leisure travel) and Carlson Marketing Group, the largest relationship marketing company in the world. In 1997, Mr. Carlson was instrumental in establishing a global partnership with Accor of Paris, which combined the business travel interests of both companies under the name Carlson Wagonlit Travel. A 1938 graduate of the University of Minnesota, Mr. Carlson was a staunch supporter of his alma mater. In 1986, he made a $25 million gift to the university, at that time the largest single gift ever given to a public university. To recognize his contributions, the university renamed its school of management the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management. He and Arleen (Martin) met at the university and were married in 1938. Together, the couple was devoted to strengthening family bonds with their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson's honors include the prestigious Linnean Medal, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, presented by H.M. Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden","excerpt":"the Viking Baron Award from the American Swedish Cultural Foundation; the Horatio Alger Award; the Swedish-American of the Year Award, Stockholm, Sweden, in 1981; the Town and Country magazine ''Philanthropist of the Year'' Award, 1987-1988; the International Citizen of the Year    Award from the City of Minneapolis; and numerous awards from the hospitality, travel and marketing industries. He was active in the Masons (33 degree) and Shriners, and Sigma Phi Epsilon national fraternity, from which he received the Order of the Golden Heart. Survivors include his beloved wife of sixty years, Arleen; daughter Marilyn Carlson Nelson and husband Dr. Glen Nelson, and daughter Barbara Carlson Gage and husband Edwin ''Skip'' Gage; grandchildren Diana Nelson and husband Marius Muresanu, Curtis Nelson and wife Margie, Wendy Nelson, Daisy Mitchell, Geoffrey Gage and wife Kelly, Scott Gage and wife Gina, Christine Gage, and Richard Gage and wife Britt; six great-grandchildren; brother Warren and wife Jane; sisters-in-law Elaine Carlson and Hazel Carlson; and numerous nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson was preceded in death by brothers Ken and Dean; a sister, Aileen Miller; and granddaughter, Juliet Nelson. Mr. Carlson will be remembered not only for the professional successes he achieved, but also for his love of family and community, and the integrity he demonstrated in everything he did. He lived a full, wonderful life and was an inspiration to his family, friends and colleagues. His sense of humor, guidance and wisdom will be missed. His immediate family, his extended family, and his corporate family around the world have pledged to follow his advice: ''Do not what I did, but seek what I sought.''

To anticipate it with pleasure is to put a hex on it, however. Such anticipation is a burden that movies of this sort immediately collapse under. You've got to discover them yourselves, which means that writing about them becomes a discreet form of public disservice.\\"Boss Nigger\\" stars Fred Williamson, one of the more popular of the new crop of black actors. He also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the movie with Jack Arnold, who directed it. Unlike most leading actors, black or white, Mr. Williamson seems to possess a genuine sense of humor that hasn't yet been systematized—like Burt Reynolds's—as part of a public personality. I have no idea whether Mr. Williamson is witty or not, though his movie is.In \\"Boss Nigger\\" he plays a bounty hunter who, with his black sidekick (D'Urville Martin), finds he has to take over the law office of a frightened frontier town in order to collect a debt. The West is that timeless West where it's always 1870, but the complications of the plot suggest the kind of West where Roy Rogers used to ride in the nineteen-forties","excerpt":"the villains are immediately identifiable, the heroes incredibly noble as well as bullet-resistant, and coincidence is a fundamental narrative device.The wit of the film is in Mr. Williamson's performance, which is an immensely self-assured parody of the Man With No Name played by Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's films. Though the screenplay gives the supposedly comic lines to Mr. Martin, it's Mr. Williamson who is responsible for most of the good humor, ambling through the movie, doing the old Eastwood act of squinting, shooting and being irresistible to women with less effort than it takes most other men to select a tie.Most black Westerns either ignore race or make it the fundamental point of the movie. \\"Boss Nigger\\" somehow manages to do both quite successfully. There's a lot made of the bigotry of the small Western town in which the black sheriff operates, but the effect of Mr. Williamson's Eastwoodesque performance has less to do with his color than with details observed and gently sent skyhigh.

The writer is the chairman of the department of art and art history at the University of Miami.    Miss Gilot replies: In Europe, artists are preoccupied with the philosophical aspects of their work, and that's the way they talk.    In the introduction to the book, I wrote: \\"The dialogues are not verbatim","excerpt":"the visits to Matisse are not quite in chronological order, and at times several meetings are contracted in one. Painters have recurring preoccupations, their thoughts are cyclical rather than linear, and they are likely to come back again and again to certain topics, to problems they must solve in their own works. I narrate the visits as if one main theme was explored in each conversation, when in fact there was more randomness and repetition.\\" Clash Of Cultures"},{"year":"1940","title":"In the executive offices of the White House, Franklin D.

Thirty years ago he even urged a struggle ''to preserve that liveliness of the individual mind so important to our civilizaton''   The MacDowell Colony, for its part, seems to have advocated a similar artistic goal. Since its founding in 1907 - the year before Mr. Carter's birth - this first artistic colony in the United States has been host to more than 2,000 artists, writers and composers, offering them solitude and support on 450 acres of farmland once owned by the American composer Edward MacDowell.

The music's power and pleasure come from its sheer relentlessness.   Ministry wouldn't mind being the voice of a generation, one that has had it up to here with its elders' sanctimonious pronouncements and self-serving actions.

At the Paramount, the audience happily yelled the title (and entire chorus) of \\"So What,\\" a reggae-and-metal song whose narrator declares, \\"I only kill to know I'm alive.\\" The music forges a coalition of rage, antisocial tendencies and abrasive sounds: the blare of heavy metal, the drone and stomp of industrial rock, the pummeling of speed-metal, the wails of sirens and feedback, the random static of sound bites.

The voice can even create, in its lower range, the illusion of being far bigger than it really is; it carries well.

American theater patented this style in plays for Lynn Fontanne and Ina Claire. American movies provided Carole Lombard in \\"My Man Godfrey\\" and Katharine Hepburn in \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Bringing Up Baby.\\" English theater gave us the plays of Noel Coward, and English literature gave us the novels of Nancy Mitford, supplemented by endless newspaper stories about the entire Mitford family.   There were six girls and a boy, raised in the English countryside by the overbearing 2d Lord Redesdale and his distantly benign wife. The girls were taught to ride and speak French; they read on their own, and for formal education they depended on the kindness of governesses. They \\"came out,\\" partied fervently and turned the heads of England's leading noblemen and writers. They were the aristocracy's version of what the Jazz Age called the \\"It\\" Girl.   Nancy was the eldest and set things in motion by leaving home to dabble in art and journalism, and then to write the novels, essays and biographies that would make her famous. \\"People always think I dash off my books with no real work, but it is not so, I very honestly do my best,\\" she told her friend and literary counselor Evelyn Waugh. Her novels are still fun to read: group portraits of women in the wilds of upper-class family life, making their way to the far-flung and not especially sheltering outposts of marriage or romance. \\"The Pursuit of Love,\\" \\"Love In a Cold Climate\\" and \\"The Blessing\\" are the best, and actually they are performance pieces: fast-paced episodes of social comedy and self-display in book form.   Her letters, filled with gossip and teases, read that way, too. Waugh had the coldest house in England, she wrote, and Anthony Powell the coldest heart. The Duchess of Windsor had liver spots, \\"which confirms my idea that only wicked people get them.\\" Randolph Churchill looked like a bombed-out building and exemplified \\"a sort of brutal island rudeness.\\" After she left England in 1945 to settle in France, she wrote to her mother that it was \\"as if I had come out of a coal mine into daylight.\\"   World War II had turned the Mitford family comedy into a melodrama with some very ugly climaxes. Six sisters born and brought up to do nothing but sparkle were suddenly called on to think and show character. The results were explosive: Unity Mitford became a Nazi, Diana became a Fascist, Jessica became a Communist and Nancy became what she called much later \\"an old-fashioned Liberal.\\" She did her sparkling best to stay on good terms with the others, and her letters show that she managed it only by ventilating behind their backs:   Nancy testified against Diana to the British Government in 1940.  (\\"Not very sisterly behavior but in such times I think it one's duty?\\") She worried that the Communist Party would spoil Jessica's sense of humor. (It did not, as books like \\"The American Way of Death\\" later showed.) And she said that her youngest sister, Deborah, had the mental age of a 9-year-old and such a wide-eyed devotion to royalty that, finding a book about the French Resistance called \\"Maquis,\\" \\"she thought this was French for Marquis & bought it, but very soon brought it back again.\\"   Nancy's letters to her mother are marvels of psychological camouflage: a daughter's version of guerrilla warfare. She respected \\"darling Muv,\\" she told Jessica in 1971, but never loved her, \\"for the evident reason that she never loved me.\\" Nine years earlier, when her mother was still living, she had written an essay that asked: \\"So what did my mother do all day? She says now, when cross-examined, that she lived for us. Perhaps she did, but nobody could say that she lived with us.\\" When Muv protested, Nancy wrote, \\"Oh goodness I thought it would make you laugh,\\" and went on to posit: \\"Anything which now seems odd or unfortunate in my childhood wasn't your fault it was the fault of the age we lived in. Children were not considered then -- or at least girls weren't.\\" Then, for reassurance, she added, \\"But the person who appears completely vile is me!\\"   It isn't true. She could appear brittle and sometimes defiantly shallow. Sad, too: the emotional temperature of the men in her life shows she knew more than anyone should about the pursuit of love in a cold climate. But she was smart, full of fun and honorable when it counted. (When she died in 1973, she left her money in trust to help needy friends and family members.) She was gallant, too. While dying of cancer, she finished a biography of Frederick the Great. She longed, she said, to be a \\"pretty young General\\" who could gallop over Europe with him \\"and never have another ache or pain.\\" Frederick also allowed her to deliver a final, ruefully fair verdict on herself. About teasing, she wrote a disapproving scholar: \\"I am a tease & I know all about it. There's always surely an element of cruelty. . . . Frederick teased often unkindly & sometimes cruelly but he didn't hang draw & quarter, or rack, or break on the wheel like others of his day. I'd much rather be teased!\\"   Pretenses aside, she didn't have just charm. Under pressure, she had character.

The claim can be admitted. It is mechanically a creditable production","excerpt":"the voices are reproduced with fidelity (on the customary magnified scale) and with a full range of tones, and synchronization is perfect. There was a sleeping scene in which the gentlemen \\"slept very loudly\\" (as a Japanese lady politely describes it) and the producer had somewhat over-enjoyed the nasal battery he conducted, but the audience thought it one of the funniest passages in the picture.The film raised in this observer's mind a question of which the Western world heard much a few years ago, namely, whether the talking film is the true line of development of the art of the cinema. As one watched and heard this popular Japanese production it was clear, at all events, that the emphasis had been changed from the thing seen to the thing heard. The audience roared at the jokes all the time just as they would have roared at slapstick comedians. It was no longer necessary to make the picture explain itself; the picture was not the play, but only half of the play. As entertainment it was better than before, but the urge, so potent in the silent screen, toward making the picture a complete, self-telling visual story, had gone. Granting that it was a better entertainment than a picture eked out with captions, or accompanied, Japanese style, by a running obbligato from the orator, one was left with a conviction that as an ordinary farce performed by actors it would have been better still. In fact, it was not a picture-play, but the picture of a play.To the foreign observer it was intensely interesting as a picture of the human comedy of modern Tokyo. In a café four scalawag students, having reached the end of their credit, arrange to enjoy the hospitality of an old classmate who has just married and who, unlike them, has a post and an income. One gives his companions the slip: you see him making a date by telephone with a flashy young taxi-dancer of the Union Dance Hall. We shall meet them again in peculiar circumstances; meantime the three set out for the neat little nest in the new suburb.Haruko, the bride (Little Spring), is not impressed by the appearance of her husband's friends and leaves them in the porch while she looks up his album of college photographs. They pass the test, and the laws of hospitality go into effect. The bourgeois standing of the young couple is indicated by innumerable subtle touches which tickle the audience. But what pleases our \\"lumpen\\" friends is not the tea in \\"foreign\\" tea cups that they are offered, but the sight of half a dozen bottles of liquor among the wedding presents. So an uproarious spree begins, dismaying the demure young bride, who respectfully sits in another room and knits while the friends of Komura-san's bachelor days enjoy themselves.An electric train whizzes past and from the station a neatly dressed, bespectacled \\"salary man,\\" the very picture of Japanese respectability, makes his way home through the half-built lots of the new suburb. Haruko meets him at the door and, as he takes his shoes off, tells him of the three old college chums. His joy is not uncontrollable, but they were his college chums, after all, and in Japan the laws of hospitality are tyrannical. So he joins them and the secret leaks out that while the Flower Bride thinks him an abstainer, he has in his time heard the chimes at midnight and found ginger hot in the mouth. But as \\"good wife, wise mother,\\" Haruko's duty is to provide the ruling sex with food and withdraw to her own room. It is weary waiting there, but worse is to come. There is a recognized stage of these reunions when the singing begins. The voices of the quartet are only good to make the audience laugh, but the husband has a clever imitation of a performing monkey which he gives in his shirt and underpants, with a leather strap hooked on for a tail. The emotions which overcome a young bride when she sees her adored bridegroom amusing his vulgar bachelor friends in their cups by imitating a performing monkey are just the same in Tokyo as in Brooklyn. When the poor man, having pulled on his pants, slips in next door to console the bride, he finds her gazing at the picture taken on the wedding day—he in his morning coat, striped trousers and stocking feet, and she with the graceful bridal bandeau on her head. Look on this picture and on that, she says, and the repentant youth promises that it will not occur again.Up till now the show has been a farce, devoid of plot and of all but the simplest ideas and spiritually not very different from the Kyogen, or interludes of broad farce interposed for comic relief between the solemn episodes of the No plays. The audience was perfectly satisfied to have no plot so long as there was plenty of fun. But now a plot began to unfold. The scalawags had no intention of going and sleep was impossible. Komura found the key of their flat and Haruko and he went into town to spend the night there. This turned over another slice of Tokyo life for the amazement and amusement of the rustics—a modern apartment house. But the fourth student, whom we left telephoning, had invited the taxi-dancer to share the flat with him in his friend's absence. They went out quietly, however, and while the bride and bridegroom slumbered within, the student and his taxi-dancer (in pajamas) sat in the communal washroom and yawned at each other.Meantime a burglary was occurring in the newlyweds' suburban home. Aroused from their drunken slumbers, the three made a drunken effort to tie the burglar up, but in the best modern style he pulled out his gun and made one of them pour out his liquor and the others ransack the drawers. Comes the dawn, and with it on an early train the bride and bridegroom. Taking in the bottle of milk—another modern novelty—they find their house burgled and their three friends asleep under the quilts and all dressed for sleeping. Failing to find the silk kimonos and the valuables and the money hidden at the right-hand corner of the bottom drawer, the burglar has gone off with the clothes of the three scalawags whom he left safely roped up. They are rigged out in a few shabby kimonos of the kind worn by women and start to walk to Tokyo in the cold, sober, penniless morning air. There is much consolation in the sight for our young friends, and to make joy complete they remember that it is Sunday morning, when salary men don't work. Hanging out a notice that callers are not being received today, they turn in for a long rest.This simple story, heavily embroidered with primitive jokes, went down very well, and when it ended the happy audience settled themselves in their seats to be thrilled with the well-worn heroic story of Isshin Tasuke, a brave defender of the poor against the rich in the days of chivalry. And as Japanese audiences, accustomed to eight hours in the theatre, like value for their money, that was followed by \\"The Love Story of the Chief Rooter,\\" a romance of modern baseball.

The three percussionists in the band were kept subdued. Not so with the second half, featuring a more modern and freewheeling jam session called a descarga that allowed the percussionists more prominence in proceedings that brought more, and more intense, improvisations to the stage.    The show was also fascinating because it revealed how the popular dance music of the Caribbean has paralleled in its evolution the path of popular African-American music, by becoming more intense and extroverted, allowing drums and drumming to dominate.

Chaos Theory in Congress"},{"year":"1990","title":"INDIANAPOLIS, July 15 - Thirty-five thousand members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, a faith born and nurtured in 19th-century America, came to terms this past week with the stark fact that theirs is no longer an American church.   At a 10-day convention at the Hoosier Dome that was attended by church members from 184 nations, delegates resoundingly rejected a resolution favored by members from the United States that women be ordained as full-fledged ministers. The change was vigorously opposed by delegates from Latin America and Africa","excerpt":"the vote was 1,173 to 377.   That vote was the most striking sign that overseas Adventists hold increasing power in the church and are not afraid to use it. While the church's newly elected president, the Rev. Robert S. Folkenberg, is an American, he is also the son of Puerto Rican missionaries and he spent two decades serving the church in Latin America.   Many Americans at the convention said it was paradoxical that Americans who founded the church no longer controlled it. \\"But it's not anything to be sad about,\\" said Roy Branson, a writer and editor who is a son and grandson of American Adventist preachers. \\"Maybe it's something to celebrate. Aside from the Catholic Church, the Adventists are now the most international church.\\"   With 6.2 million members worldwide, the Adventists, who emphasize winning converts, have been remarkably successful in spreading their message. The church has grown by about 40 percent over the last five years. Virtually every nation in the world has an Adventist church.   Founded in 1863 in Battle Creek, Mich., the Adventist Church is based on the belief that these are the \\"last days\\" and that the end of the world is near. Out of the chaos of destruction, they believe, a new earth will emerge in which those redeemed by Christ will live eternally. Unlike some other apocalyptic groups, however, the Adventists do not set a date for the end of the world.   And, while waiting, they are very much concerned with matters of this world. They have put a great deal of emphasis on health care and have built a network of hospitals. Adventists do not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco.   While faithful to the New Testament, Adventists give great authority to the laws enunciated in the Old Testament. Invoking the Fourth Commandment, they observe Saturday rather than Sunday as the Christian Sabbath. They also distinguish between \\"clean\\" and \\"unclean\\" meats as spelled out in Leviticus, observing a modified form of the kosher laws kept by observant Jews.   According to church statistics, Adventism has grown by 1.8 million members since the church held its last world convention in 1985, although the rate of growth is much higher abroad than in the United States. In 1989, for example, there were 90 conversions to the faith each day in North America, while there were 361 a day in East Africa.   F. Donald Yost, the denomination's director of archives and statistics, says the number of Adventists abroad has exceeded those in North America since 1922.   Until now, however, Americans were able to retain control of the direction and policies of the church, in part through their financial dominance. Even today, 80 percent of the $160 million annual budget of the church's world headquarters in Silver Spring, Md., comes from American donors.   Today, only 12 percent of Adventists live in North America. About 30 percent live in Africa and 40 percent in Central and South America and the Caribbean.   On the question of whether women should be fully ordained, both sides invoked the name of an early church leader, Ellen White, whose written accounts of visions of heaven continue to shape the theology of the church.   \\"It's not only ironic but appalling that we can't ordain women when our leading founder was Mrs. White, someone we quote more than St. Peter or St. Paul,\\" said Capt. Herman Loris Kibble, an Adventist minister who is a Naval chaplain based in Oakland, Calif.

It is interesting that in Italy, of all places, Wagner's operas were so dominant 30 years after the composer's death that avant-gardists needed to protest.

Tchekhof's portrayal of a waiter, are splendidly sketched in the Soviet silent film, \\"The Man From the Restaurant,\\" the current attraction at the Cameo. It is a picture with many compelling scenes and a few weak ones. J. A. Protazanof, the director, sets forth some effective contrasts, which are suited to the abstract nature of the chronicle. M. Protazanof is clever in the handling of detail, whether it concerns the doings in a restaurant, the home life of the waiter, or the activities in a departmental war office.The waiter is the hero, while the rogues are a war profiteer and a bullet-headed General. The story, such as it is, happens to be chiefly concerned with the experiences of a waiter in an expensive restaurant. He is depicted as honest in the face of temptation, while the General willingly accepts a bribe from the profiteer.It is 1916. The waiter, an elderly man, receives word of his son's death on the eastern front. The shock caused by the loss of her son kills the waiter's wife and the bereaved father turns to his daughter for solace. The girl has been studying the violin, but she is informed that because of her absence from the academy and the amount owed for tuition she has been dropped from the list of students.The daughter is played by Vera Malinovskaya, to whom the camera is none too kind. She is too placid a type to make the latter sequences of this production convincing. It is this girl whose beauty is supposed to inspire the profiteer to tempt her with his attentions and gifts. The young man with whom the girl is in love works in the secret archives of the General's office. The profiteer decides that the loss of a secret document would cause no end of trouble to both the young man and the girl. The director of the film arranges much too easily for the scoundrel to steal one of the confidential missives, the loss of which subsequently is the despair of the young persons.The profiteer later hints to the girl that she can gain possession of a \\"valuable envelope\\" if she will come to his home to supper. The waiter, not knowing that the profiteer is entertaining his (the waiter's) daughter, is assigned to take charge of the supper sent to the profiteer's home from the restaurant. This fact and the sudden appearance of the young man, who given chase to the vehicle on its way to the scoundrel's home, results finally in the profiteer being angry, dishevelled and thoroughly disappointed.M. Tchekhof, except for one or two scenes when he makes grimaces to express alarm or dismay, is extraordinary real as the waiter. He makes the most of the time when he finds a banknote, which, after hiding it in his sock, putting it under his shirt front and then in his pocket, he finally decides to return to the owner, who doesn't even nod thanks. M. Tchekhof also does well in the glimpses of the waiter's home. Stefan Kuznetzof is capital as the thick-skinned gourmandizing General. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Waiter and the Profiteer.

Sounds not only issued from the screen but also from various sections of the theatre. The latter sequences of this film, in which there are only a few snatches of Vitaphoned voices, are imposing, for they depict King Nephilim and his hosts in jangling coverings, but the long stretches concerned with the World War, introduced as the deluge of blood, are somewhat wearisome.The production is a strange combination of scenes in which Dolores Costello plays trying rôles, during the modern story and latterly in the biblical spectacle. George O'Brien also had many an uncomfortable hour while doing his bit, first on the battlefield and latterly as a blinded victim of the imaginative Nephilim. Even Noah Beery, as a lustful Russian officer in the World War, is one of those supposed to be wrecked in a Constantinople-Paris express train, which falls from a high bridge, and in the biblical chapters he is among those who are finally drowned in the flood.The audience last night applauded the first glimpse of the animals scurrying to safety aboard the Ark. They also clapped when the flood came, for they had evidently expected this climax long before. The Ark, like the surging waters, is also shown in a preface to the modern narrative as well as at the end.The scene where Noah gazes upon the word of God written in fire on the pages of stone is set forth with no little skill, but it comes at a time when one feels rather tired of the production, especially the popular melodramatic flashes of the war.So far as the modern chronicle is concerned, it is depicted without much conception of the World War, and coincidences pop up most conveniently. Toward the close of this section of the picture Nickoloff (Mr. Berry) is suddenly gifted with speech. He presumes that he has seen Mary (Miss Costello) before. And, when she leaves the stage where she has been dancing with other girls, he realizes that she is the little German girl who was in the train wreck. He shows her the scar on his hand, the result of a scuffle he had with Travis (Mr. O'Brien). Mary thinks that she will escape from this monster, but he is alert and as he talks to her he permits the \\"evidence\\" of her being a spy to drop from his hand into her open suitcase. The instant he blows a whistle soldiers hurry to the spot, and, apparently without further ado, the poor child is condemned to be shot. And who should be in the firing squad but Travis? He had married this German girl before he, in a \\"Big Parade\\" manner, marched off to the trenches.It is soon after this that the story goes back into the ages with a vengeance, introducing Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth. This Biblical spectacle goes on and on as if one hadn't sat through a modern story—of great quantity, if nothing else. There is also quantity about the biblical scenes, which are impressive chiefly because of the numerical strength of the persons involved than through what happens.The introductory scenes of the modern chronicle, those aboard the Constantinople-Paris train, hold out considerable promise for this production and the effect of the crashing of the stone brindge and the glimpses of the on-rushing train are expertly conceived. Michael Curtiz, the director, not only depicts the first cars of the train crashing far below from the shattered structure, but he turns his camera to scenes inside the cars and shows the passengers thrown from the floor to the ceiling.Miss Costello, who is lovely in many sequences, is heard through the medium of the Vitaphone. Her voice is quite charming, but her lines are frequently inept. Mr. O'Brien has his turn at talking, and while there is no reflection on his voice, what he has to say would have been far more eloquent in simple pantomine. This dialogue is little more than audible spoken-titles, which are all very well in text, but when these utterances are heard they frequently border on the ridiculous.Miss Costello does some excellent work. Mr. O'Brien has been seen to greater advantage in other films. Mr. Beery is too much the melodramatic villain during the whole production.Prior to the presentation of the main feature Hope Hampton was seen in a Vitaphone version of scenes from \\"Manon.\\" Her voice came out naturally and clearly, and applause greeted this operatic study.

It is called \\"The Raider Emden,\\" and the scenes depict the activities aboard the German warship, the sinking of three or four vessels (flashes from actual war pictures) and finally the fight with the British warship Sydney. This film was produced with the cooperation of the German Admiralty and the treatment is as sane as that of the British production, \\"The Battles of Coronel and Falkland Islands,\\" which was on exhibition at the same theatre several weeks ago. There is no bitterness, the sea-fighters of both nations being depicted equally gallant and equally tenacious.Captain von Muller is impersonated in a thoroughly dignified fashion and so is the commander of the Sydney, who, in one of the last scenes, informs von Muller that \\"the King wishes the officers of the Emden to keep their swords.\\"When the Germans are seen on the deck of the Sydney they are stained with blood and explosives. The British, however, appear in spotless white, which is rather a mistake. In this film the producers have encountered the problem of changing weather. Hence, you see a sea whipped by a strong wind, but when an officer looks through his glasses the sea Las suddenly moderated. An instant afterward it is rough and then it is smooth again.The principal dramatic point of this picture is where the Emden goes forth to destroy a wireless station at Cocos Island. The British are surprised, but they succeed in sending a message just before the Emden's operator jams the air. It is supposed to be through this message that the Sydney was able to find the Emden, which at that time was expecting a prize collier.The Emden's guns are also seen blowing up oil tanks on the South Indian coast. A stimulating sequence is that devoted to the capture of a passenger vessel. It gives one quite an idea of what happened during the war. Elderly gentlemen are surprised and a lot of passengers are gaily enjoying the swimming pool aboard ship. A few minutes later there is a scramble to leave the vessel. There are a few scenes devoted to the wife of one of the Emden's officers, who happens to be aboard the passenger vessel. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The War at Sea. Mr. Clemenceau's Novel.

In opposition, others a rgue that the Russians will not be impressed with increases in U nited States defense spending if they are inefficient and that therei s no way that the huge increases sought by the President can be i mplemented efficiently. Still others - though a notable minority - d o not see the Russians as much of a threat at all.\\n\\nThe higher levels of defense spending desired by the President are impressive. Between the fiscal years 1981 and 1987, outlays would grow almost 15 percent a year. The increase in the fiscal year 1983 alone will be almost $34 billion. For perspective, this far exceeds the entire amount of the President's originally recommended 1983 spending levels for housing assistance ($8.9 billion), food stamps ($10.3 billion), and Aid to Families with Dependent Children ($6.9 billion).

But what was supposed to be a celebration of fruit and free trade is fast becoming a major source of friction between Washington and Tokyo. The apple farmers here in the nation's most productive fruit-growing region, who have spent more than decade setting up 3,500 acres of orchards to meet Japan's standards, now say they have been betrayed. Isolated Apple Orchards    Concerned about protecting its own highly lucrative apple-growing industry, Japan has long insisted that American fruit be free of any insects that might cross the Pacific. American farmers say most of Japan's pest concerns are phony, used as a convenient trade barrier. Still, until now, the Americans have dutifully done everything the Japanese said they would have to do to get their fruit into Japan.   American apple growers planted trees that were isolated from other orchards to minimize possible contact with insects. Special traps for bugs were set up. And some of the fruit has been individually wrapped in paper while still on the tree.   All was set for this year's breakthrough crop. But then, earlier this summer, Japan raised fresh concerns about pests that the American growers say are nonexistent.   Infuriated, the apple farmers of Washington State, who raise half the nation's crop and ship their fruit to 24 countries, including several in Asia, have taken the first step to bring trade sanctions against Japan. They are also talking about smashing Japanese electronic products in symbolic acts of defiance.   And at a recent food fair in Japan, American apple growers had a barren display with a sign that read, \\"Empty boxes, empty promises.\\"   \\"We have gone through every hoop they have asked us to go through, and we're just fed up,\\" said Doug Pauly, an apple grower and shipper here. \\"We've had people tearing out pear trees and vineyards and rose bushes so they wouldn't be near these special orchards. Then, we get this close and the Japanese move the goal posts again. We can't win.\\"   Apples are to Japanese and American trade policy what intercontinental missiles were to the cold war. Both sides have them. They have long been a bargaining chip. And now one side says it is time to put up or shut up.   In Japan, where a single apple can cost up to $5 at a fruit stand, American apples are forbidden by a long-standing agricultural policy that requires importers to prove that the produce is free of insects. The Americans say they have done this, but the Japanese say other scientific concerns remain.   The Americans, from the growers here to the highest reaches of the Clinton Administration, say it is a clear-cut issue. As such, apples have become the symbol of President Clinton's effort to open Japanese markets by appealing to the consumer. Gains for Both Countries    American apples would be a bargain to the Japanese consumer, while bringing huge profits to growers here. The growers had expected to sell up to 700,000 42-pound boxes, offering Japanese consumers the red and golden Delicious variety of apples at roughly half the price of Japan's major domestically grown variety, the Fuji. If, as expected, the growers were to get from $75 to $100 a box, it would bring them more than four times what they would receive in this country.   Two weeks ago, the Administration demanded that Japan take steps to import American apples beginning with next year's crop.   \\"The U.S. side, for its part, has bent over backwards to accommodate Japanese concerns,\\" Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, and Mike Espy, the Secretary of Agriculture, wrote in a letter to Masami Tanabu, Japan's Agriculture Minister. The American officials demanded a \\"written Japanese commitment\\" of all the steps needed for apples to get into Japan next year.   The Japanese, who already import a small amount of apples from New Zealand, have yet to respond to the specific complaints of the letter. Nor have they explained why these new insect questions were raised at the 11th hour. In a brief letter to the Clinton Administration they said the recent change in Government in Japan would delay an answer to the questions.   In the past, Japanese agriculture officials raised concerns about the possibility of pests infecting their own fruit if American apples were allowed into Japan. And they have denied that apples were being kept out for political reasons.   \\"What Japan needs is for the the United States to prove that its apples are safe,\\" KenjiNOr Nakano, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Washington, said in an interview. \\"This is not a political issue. It is purely a technical one.\\"   With the United States running a $50 billion trade deficit with Japan, apples are a relatively small item on the bargaining table. But, as Mr. Kantor said in his letter, the issue has become \\"highly symbolic.\\"   He raised the issue last month in talks between the two governments during Mr. Clinton's trip to Japan. In the American view, Japan bans United States apples for only one reason: to protect their own farmers.   Washington State's 3,500 apple farmers produce twice as many apples as their Japanese counterparts. But Japan has more than 10 times as many apple farmers, who raise their fruit on small plots and receive high prices for the produce, primarily Fuji apples.   Nor do they see any market logic behind Japanese protectionism. They contend that Washington apples, marketed for lunch buckets and snacks, would not cut into the markets of Japanese growers because the addition of American varieties would complement the more delicate Japanese product, change eating habits and expand the market.   They point to past food barriers on cherries and beef, which were lifted to the satisfaction of farmers in both countries. The success of Pacific Northwest cherries, which sometimes sell for as much as $1 a cherry in Japan, has fueled the drive by American growers to get into the lucrative Japanese market.   \\"Here you have an industry that has played by the rules, done everything right, and in the end still cannot get into Japan,\\" said Bill Bryant, an agricultural trade consultant in Seattle. \\"Now it's becoming symbolic of blatant, unfair trading policies.\\"   Of particular concern to the Japanese officials in the past has been whether American apples might carry a pest known as the coddling moth. The growers here say any such pests are killed during cold storage, when the apples, before shipment, are kept in a dark room at near freezing temperatures with almost no oxygen.   But after the coddling moth issue was satisfied, the Japanese raised a new concern about fire blight, a bacteria that typically infects pears. They wanted to make sure that no pear trees were grown near the apples","excerpt":"the Washington growers complied, planting orchards that were at least 500 meters, or nearly 1,641 feet, from pear trees.   Since then, new pest issues have been raised. \\"We call it the bug-of-the-month club,\\" Mr. Pauly said.   The Japanese say that even if these pests have not shown up in American fruit, their precaution is warranted by the need to protect their own produce from foreign insects.   Although they demanded that Japan take steps that would lead to apple imports by next year's harvest, some growers here have given up hope that diplomacy will work. They want to use the stick of reciprocal trade sanctions.   As for all those well-tended apples fattening on isolated trees near the Columbia River -- perhaps as many as 25 million pieces of fruit -- the growers say they will try to sell them to some other country. But given the cost it has taken to grow them, they say, they may not break even.

It was the television comedian Dave Chappelle's riotous sendup of James's addictions, abuses and all-around sleaziness that managed to resurrect and thoroughly reinscribe the musician's self-inflicted image as a clownish, amoral grotesque. Not quite pop music's Fatty Arbuckle -- James's indiscretions left no corpses, and after serving time in prison for sexually assaulting to women, he drifted rather easily back into his recording career -- neither did he parlay his romance with cocaine into an image of poignant repentance, à la Richard Pryor. And no matter how often he alluded to tastes for white women or under-age girls, he was never as threatening a figure as, say, Jack Johnson, or even Chuck Berry. Not with that panda-bear posture, not with that childish leer. Instead, dogged by how perfectly the term ''Super Freak'' fit to the cartoon-pimp image he manufactured and then inhabited far too sincerely, James seemed merely icky, and silly.    What's lost behind the admittedly entertaining caricature is, well, only everything I'd like to suggest ought to be recalled about Rick James:    1. Despite an aura of heavy-lidded indolence that attached to his long, drug-addled waning from the pop charts, Rick James worked harder than most, toiled at his trade, paid lavish dues: some 16 years' worth by the time of the overnight success of ''Super Freak'' in 1981. James might be called the Pete Rose of funk; deprived of Sly Stone's or Prince's native genius, he scrapped his way to the top. Born in 1948 as James Johnson Jr. in Buffalo, he was the third of eight children raised on the wrong side of that hard-bitten town's tracks by a single mother, a Harlem nightclub dancer turned numbers runner. At 15, James joined the Naval Reserve, then went AWOL on being designated for Vietnam. In exile in Toronto, he formed the Mynah Birds, an integrated rock band that included a young Neil Young, as well as a future member of Steppenwolf. On behalf of the band, James played his one card: papa may have been a rolling stone, but his uncle was a Temptation -- specifically Melvin Franklin, the bass-voiced anchor of the legendary singing group. The Mynah Birds were signed to Motown, but Motown executives, on learning of James's dereliction of duty, insisted he ''face the music'' (literally) before beginning his career. He duly spent time in the brig, and Motown shelved the demo tapes, which remain unreleased. Then came another decade's apprenticeship; writing songs for Motown, more demos, more forgotten bands in Detroit and London and at last, in 1978, more than a decade after his first band, a breakthrough with the single ''You and I,'' from his debut album. Nor did the effort diminish with success: along with his own steady output, James was a tireless impresario who created hits for the Mary Jane Girls, Teena Marie and Eddie Murphy. In collaborations on his own records, James gave a leg up both to his elders, the Temptations and Smokey Robinson, and to some of the rappers who had yet to conquer the world. As much as for his showmanship and his lunacy, James ought to be remembered for his ambition, his fluency, his professionalism. Among his colleagues and collaborators, he is.

Augusto Pinochet in the 1988 plebiscite on which he bet his presidency, the gray land that he had spent 15 years creating suddenly went Technicolor. Exiles flocked home, politics came alive and passions that had been consigned to old songs and private conversation spilled again into the streets. And from old boxes and behind shelves, Chilean photographers pulled out negatives that through years of poverty and censorship had mostly gone unprinted. With the American photojournalist Susan Meiselas, 16 of them have now assembled many of those images in an extraordinary visual memoir, CHILE: From Within (Norton, $39.95). The book is most striking for what it leaves out. General Pinochet -- who once boasted that not a leaf moved in Chile without his knowledge -- appears only twice. Instead of the street violence that he made a news agency staple, the photographers offer images such as that of a dwarf in a business suit, crossing a promenade that riot police have just swept of demonstrators, or a park after curfew, its inviting benches filled only by an eerie mist. Though the photographs are uneven in their power, almost none of them reveal themselves on first glance. But even before the photographs give way to a selection of writings by the Chilean novelist Ariel Dorfman, the book manages to explain much about how a people coddled for so long by democracy were able to endure General Pinochet's dictatorship and then so patiently take back their freedom.

Its prominence in music doesn't just have to do with the way it sounds","excerpt":"the way it looks is important, too. Would-be rockers practice wielding imaginary instruments in front of their bedroom mirrors, and rock's guitar stars hold and move their instruments as distinctively as they play them. Some crouch low and sweep the audience with their guitar neck as if it were a machine gun; others telegraph the forward thrust of their rhythms with expressive body English.   Such guitar-playing pop stars of the 1950's as Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Elvis Presley popularized many of the ways guitars are wielded today. So it is no surprise that the instrument is now suffering from overexposure, which in turn may be one reason so many pop musicians are exploring synthesizers and electronic instruments.   But there are plenty of guitarists who don't sound like the average arena rock hotshot who simply varies familiar poses and movements, and four of them are performing in the city this weekend.

MANY FACE DEATH IN AFRICA, U.N. SAYS"},{"year":"1991","title":"WHAT'S going on? It's hard to remember a time of so much confusion on the state of the economy and the financial markets. These questions are being asked:   Q. The Dow has hit 3,000. But what is the basis for this optimism?   A. The expectation that the economy will soon turn up, but so gradually that inflation will come down, so the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates to support the recovery and keep the White House off its back.    Q. But isn't the Fed torn by internal dissension over whether to lower interest rates?    A. There are such conflicts, although some insiders insist they are exaggerated. David D. Hale, chief economist and chief Fed watcher of Kemper Financial Services, said: \\"Despite all the recent publicity about divisions within the Federal Open Market Committee about the role of the chairman in deciding when to lower interest rates, there is a general recognition that the economy is still weak, and policy remains asymmetrically biased toward ease.\\"    Q. Does the Treasury see it that way? Wouldn't the Treasury like to see the Fed ease interest rates further and faster?    A. Yes it would. The Treasury has made no secret of its leaning on the Fed for greater ease, to help break the credit crunch.    Q. Is there a credit crunch?    A. Some economists insist that loans are off because of weak demand. But Deputy Secretary of the Treasury John Robson is certain there is a crunch. \\"I've gone around the country talking to many kinds of businessmen, and not just in the Northeast, and they tell me there's not enough credit available,\\" he said in an interview yesterday. \\"They tell me there's a lack of willingness on the part of the banks to step in and lend or even renew credits already extended -- they're cutting people off in the middle of the movie.\\"    Q. What is the cause of the crunch?    A. Mr. Robson said it has four causes: \\"The economic downturn and the deteriorated collateral of many borrowers","excerpt":"the weakened condition of the banks, now trying to strengthen their capital positions by stopping loans; the regulators, who are being too tough on the banks, and the Fed, still holding interest rates too high.\\" He added: \\"Inflation is not the threat today. Growth is the issue.\\"    Q. Do the regulators admit they are being too tough?    A. No. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision jointly issued a statement declaring: \\"We do not want the availability of credit to sound borrowers to be adversely affected by supervisory misunderstandings about them.\\"    Q. With recovery ahead, can we breathe easily about the condition of the banks? Or could there be a replay of the savings and loan debacle?    A. Bank failures have been rising among smaller institutions, but the Administration and the General Accounting Office both support the \\"too big to fail\\" doctrine. The Administration says there is no comparability between the commercial banks and the savings and loans; it maintains that the banks are far better capitalized and are not riddled with fraud, as were many savings institutions.   The Administration believes that, with less regulation and new powers to expand across state lines and enter the insurance and securities businesses, the banks can safely expand. Its critics, led by the G.A.O., insist that the banks must first put their houses and balance sheets in order before they can be trusted to expand into new lines. But the Treasury's Mr. Robson blasts the regulators for \\"regulating with a chain saw.\\"    Q. Has the stock market concluded that in any contest between the Administration and the regulators the Administration has the big guns and will win?\\"    A. So it seems. The Administration has made liquidating the recession its prime objective. Worsening labor market conditions in March and early April, declines in hours worked, continued weakness in retail spending, slipping housing starts, trims in business inventories, sluggish business plans to invest in new plant and equipment -- all these imply that the economy is still in recession.    The White House wants monetary policy to reinforce fiscal policy to lift the economy out of the slump. The budget deficit is projected to reach nearly $300 billion in the fiscal year 1991 and $290 billion in fiscal year 1992. Even for a non-Keynesian Administration, that ain't hay in the stimulus department.    But a two-year deficit of nearly $600 billion has the traditionalists on the Federal Open Market Committee worrying about inflation. Mr. Greenspan, the peace keeper, is trying to keep the Administration content, without facing an open revolt within the Fed. and without regenerating inflation. This week the stock market was betting it his way.

The appeal of these trusts - somewhat similar to partnerships in their makeup - has been a combination of capital return and certain tax advantages. Unit holders share in the tax benefits, according to analysts, since the income passes directly to them and avoids taxation at the corporate level.

Behind the News -- Republicans held on to the seat, which was left vacant when Randy Cunningham resigned after pleading guilty in a corruption scandal. But the thin victory margin of the winner, Brian P. Bilbray, was a sign that the party may be in for difficult times in more competitive districts. Campaigns were already in full swing in some of those districts, long before the traditional Labor Day start of the election season.    CYBER-RIVALRY    The News -- Google unveiled a new online spreadsheet program, the latest volley in its attacks against its rival Microsoft.    Behind the News -- The free program, Google Spreadsheets, is designed to allow multiple users to work on a spreadsheet simultaneously. But more important, perhaps, is that it can read files created in Microsoft's popular program Excel. So it's another step in Google's efforts to make inroads on Microsoft's core business, desktop programs. Microsoft has countered in recent years by expanding its Web offerings.    BOOMTOWN    The News -- Construction contractors for the Freedom Tower announced they would begin work on the foundation by blasting away bedrock.    Behind the News -- While the thought of more explosions at the World Trade Center site might be chilling to residents and workers in Lower Manhattan, those in charge of the project said that the detonations, to be carried out over two months, would hardly be noticeable. Blasting, they added, would produce far less dust and din than the constant pounding of an alternative method, hydraulic rams attached to backhoes.    M-M-MEMORIES    The News -- Barbra Streisand announced she would perform in 20 cities this fall, her first concert tour in a dozen years.    Behind the News -- Since Ms. Streisand, 64, never really retired, it's not a comeback tour. A more accurate description might be ''marathon fund-raising event.'' The singer, who has long used her concerts to raise money for political causes, said she would donate proceeds this time to educational, environmental and women's health groups.    PLAYTIME    The News -- The 32-team World Cup soccer tournament got under way in Germany with the opening match in Munich.    Behind the News -- Concerns about how the monthlong event might be affected by racist fans, bribable referees, an influx of prostitutes and even the shape of the ball dominated much of the discussion in the weeks leading up to it. Most of the worries melted away as play began, although German and English fans had to be separated by police officers in Frankfut. In the opener, Germany defeated Costa Rica, 4-2.

The word gets around that she was last seen in the company of a strange white man. The stranger is quickly picked up. He turns out to be the transient nephew of the biggest, the toughest and apparently the most bigoted building contractor in town. Right away, the word passes among the town's Negroes that this privileged stranger is going to be permitted to go free, and before you know it a state of tension between the races brings acts of violence which soon flare into open riot.No doubt, an ugly situation such as this could conceivably occur in a community where disharmony and suspicion already existed between the Negroes and the whites. No doubt, wild rumors and heated tempers, such as are graphically shown here, could start the flames. But it is specifically stated by one of the Negroes in this picture that there has never been any \\"race trouble\\" in this town, and the writers have neglected to develop any basis for a distrust of justice or an explosion of hate. Prejudice and antagonism are arbitrarily and recklessly assumed and portrayed in a maner which appears less calculated to understand society than to create an effect.And then, when it is discovered that the mising child is at the bottom of an abandoned well, the authors have swiftly relaxed the racial tension just as arbitrarily as they have turned it on. They have suddenly united the whole town, Negroes and whites, in abond of sympathy for the little girl's agonized parents and a rush of eagerness to save her from doom. They haven't even stopped to note, for instance, that suspicion might still grip angry minds that the quickly exonerated stranger had harmed the child and then stuffed her in the well.Once these pitfalls are jumped, however, and the picture is squared away on its main course of demonstrating all the spectacle and emotion of a rescue attempt, it throbs with legitimate excitement and the pulse of brotherly love. Events move with stirring acceleration, and the whole drama of waiting crowds and drilling machines, driving under floodlights in the night time, has been vividly created by Directors Popkin and Rouse. The compassion may be slightly excessive and the conclusion idealized beyond belief, but electricity flows through the picture while they're getting that child out of the ground.It is in this stage of the picture that the cast also stands up best—Richard Rober as a duty-bound sheriff, Barry Kelly as the local contractor, Henry Morgan as the put-up stranger and Maidie Norman as the mother of the child. Townsfolk and deputy sheriffs are also credibly played by an assortment of unfamiliar performers in this valid section of the film.There are serious holes in this picture—and some inflamatory recklessness, we fear. But its message of brotherhood seems well intended and that rescue operation packs real thrills.

Black Reaganauts brought a welcome diversity to conservative politics. But their main function was to validate moral indictments of the poor. The most obvious case was Clarence Thomas, who trashed the civil rights movement every chance he got and insulted his sister for resorting to welfare during a crisis. Colin Powell figures in this debate as well, both as a black Reaganaut and a self-identified West Indian.   Because some analyses show them outpacing African-Americans in income, West Indians are routinely held up as proof that discrimination plays no real role in poverty. In \\"Wealth and Poverty,\\" the bible of the first Reagan White House, George Gilder argued that West Indians born in the United States exceeded even WASP's in education and median income, and that therefore discrimination was no obstacle to black upward mobility. The economist Thomas Sowell took up the case in several books, insisting that the advantage lay not just with West Indians born here but with West Indian immigrants generally. New analyses have cast doubt on both claims. But even taken at face value, the Gilder-Sowell arguments were loaded and tendentious.

The tumult of the last six days has ended Mr. Gorbachev's primacy and with it, apparently, a thousand-year tradition of concentrating absolute power in one man or woman. For policy makers in Washington and other Western capitals, the problem now is how to deal with yet another radically different Soviet Union, one whose very shape, whose policies and principles are unclear, but whose complexity is assured by the success of the Russian people for the first time in substituting the popular will for the tyranny of czar and dictator.

American officials cautioned that they had not yet received any confirmation that the test had occurred.  A1    The North Korea nuclear test amounted to a major failure for China, which mounted one of its most extensive diplomatic efforts in years to find a negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis. The Chinese expressed their anger in unusually strong terms, saying the test was ''flagrant and brazen.''  A6    Tsunami Project Stalled  Construction of a road in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, meant as a good-will gesture from the American people to the survivors of the 2004 tsunami, has met with difficulty. Because of long negotiations to acquire right of way through residential and farm land, and through several hundred graves of religious significance, the project has not even started.  A8    Hints at Need for Iraq Change  James A. Baker III, the Republican co-chairman of a panel reassessing Iraq strategy for President Bush, said he expected that the panel would depart from Mr. Bush's repeated calls to ''stay the course,'' and he strongly suggested that the White House enter direct talks with countries it has so far kept at arms length, including Iran and Syria.  A1    American and Iraqi troops fought a fierce battle with militants in the city of Diwaniya, a stronghold of militia members loyal to radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, the American military said. The skirmish was the third serious clash between American or Iraqi soldiers against members of the Mahdi Army in Diwaniya in less than two months.  A8    Japan and China Mend Fences  China and Japan said they had made progress addressing their historical animosities and territorial differences as Shinzo Abe, the new Japanese prime minister, made his first trip to mend ties with Asian neighbors. President Hu Jintao of China, left, called Mr. Abe's visit a turning point for two Asian powers whose relations had sharply declined.  A3    Iran Opposition Cleric Seized  Ayatollah Mohammad Kazemeni Boroujerdi, a senior cleric who opposes clerical rule of Iran, was arrested after clashes with Iranian police officers, news agencies reported. The reports quoted officials as saying that some of the cleric's supporters were armed with knives and daggers and that the police used tear gas to disperse them.  A3    Transponder Not Recalled  The electronic device for broadcasting a plane's identity and altitude carried by the business jet that apparently collided with a Boeing 737 over the Amazon was not one of the potentially faulty ones ordered repaired by American safety officials, the manufacturer said.  A9    NATIONAL A10-15    Religious Employers Enjoy Legal Shield From Lawsuits  Legislators, judges and regulators have carved out or preserved safe havens that shield religious employers of all faiths from most employee lawsuits, from laws protecting pensions and providing unemployment benefits, and from laws that give employees the right to form unions to negotiate with their employers.  A1    Virginia Republicans Resolute  In dozens of interviews in southeastern Virginia, a swing state in tight races for the House and Senate, many conservative Christians said that rather than discourage them from going to the polls, the scandal surrounding Representative Mark Foley only reinforced their reasons to vote for their Republican incumbents.  A1    For all the contradictions and inconsistencies in the tale of Mark Foley, the investigation into how Republicans handled concerns about his conduct may hinge on what transpired in a private meeting that was convened in his office last year.  A12    Races Hinge on Local Economy  Michigan's political races for governor and the Senate are hinging nearly entirely on the struggling economy and the question of who is to blame for it. And in other Rust Belt states, including Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, economic worries are playing a similar role, if a far more subtle one.  A10    Lawyer's Book Causes Trouble  Joyce Dudley, a deputy district attorney in Santa Barbara, published a crime novel. The novel concerns a rape case with echoes of a real one. An appeals court in Ventura, Calif., ruled that Ms. Dudley's novel had crossed an ethical line, and removed her from the case.  A10    Fight Over National Park Hunt  Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, is fighting to preserve an agreement by the National Park Service to close 45,000 acres of parkland on Santa Rosa Island, Calif., to the public for hunting, August through December.  A15    Lettuce Recalled for E. Coli  Less than a week after the Food and Drug Administration lifted its warning on fresh spinach grown in the Salinas Valley, a popular brand of lettuce grown there was recalled over concerns about E. coli contamination. The lettuce does not appear to have caused any illnesses, the president of the grower said.  A10    Senator's Finances Questioned  For the past five years, Senator George Allen, Republican of Virginia, has failed to tell Congress about stock options he received for his work as a director of a high-tech company. Congressional rules require senators to disclose all deferred compensation, like stock options.  A13    NEW YORK/REGION B1-8    Despite Criticism at Home, Giuliani Retains Support  Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, is scheduled to make his first public appearance in two years in New Hampshire. Yet as Mr. Giuliani traverses the country, polls show he has emerged as a leading candidate for the Republican presidential primaries -- largely because of how he guided a wounded city in the weeks after 9/11.  B1    Cluster of Sex Offenders  A house where four sex offenders lived together as roommates has caused an uproar in Suffolk County, where one Suffolk County lawmaker has called for legislation to prevent groups of registered sex offenders from living together.  B1    A Mall of Knockoffs  In the last two years, the city has seized close to $50 million in counterfeit goods from the city's top haven for knockoff and phony goods, and shut down 15 buildings that it claimed were once occupied almost entirely by counterfeiters, but thousands of people still pack the area on weekends.  B1    SPORTSMONDAY D1-10    Steinbrenner Silent on Torre  George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, is fuming over the team's first-round elimination by the Detroit Tigers. He issued a blistering statement through his publicist but took no action on Joe Torre, his manager for the last 11 seasons.  D1    Ugly Finish at Talladega  Brian Vickers won the UAW-Ford 500 at Talladega Superspeedway, after pushing his teammate Jimmie Johnson's car into Dale Earnhardt Jr., on the backstretch of the last lap.  D9    ARTS E1-10    Unlikely Success at Book Fair  A book by the American author Jonathan Littell, ''Les Bienveillantes,'' has taken the Frankfurt fair, the world's largest booksellers' convention, by storm. Written in French, the novel features an unrepentant Nazi SS officer as the hero and could command $1 million, publishers say.  E1    OBITUARIES B9    David G.

Three bills will be considered: one sponsored by members of the Black Caucus, one backed by the Democratic leadership and some Republicans, and President Bush's bill. DISPARATE IMPACT Suits involving hiring or promotion practices, like tests, that are apparently fair on their face but have a \\"disparate impact\\" -- resulting in the hiring, for example, of proportionately more whites than blacks or more men than women -- are sometimes called \\"unintentional discrimination\\" cases. There are major differences on how each stage of such cases should be handled.  Issue: How specific do complainants have to be in court?  In the 1989 Wards Cove v. Atonio case, the Supreme Court said it would be unfair to employers to allow complainants to attack a group of practices and assert that their cumulative effect was discriminatory.  Black Caucus: Complainants can demonstrate that a \\"group of employment practices\\" caused a discriminatory result.   Democrats: Complainants must cite a specific practice, or practices, unless a court finds that despite a \\"diligent effort,\\" that is an impossible burden, as when, for example, an employer had not kept records.  Bush: A specific practice, or practices, would have to be cited.  Issue: Who has the burden of proof, the employer or the employee?  In the Wards Cove case, the Supreme Court held that once complainants had shown, usually through statistics, that a \\"disparate impact\\" had resulted from an employment practice, the complainants still had the burden of proof of showing that the employer had no business necessity for the practice.  Black Caucus: Once a \\"disparate impact\\" is shown, the burden of proof shifts to the employer, on the ground that the employer, not the complainant, is in the best position to know why a practice is necessary.  Democrats: The same.  Bush: The same.  Issue: What kind of \\"business necessity\\" can legitimize a practice that screens out women and minorities?   In Wards Cove, the Supreme Court ruled that an employment practice with apparent discriminatory effect can be justified if it \\"serves, in a significant way, the legitimate employment goals of the employer.\\" It need not be either \\"essential\\" or \\"indispensable.\\"   The Wards Cove definition is easier for employers to meet than the definition set in the 1971 Griggs v. Duke Power Co. Under Griggs, employers had to show that the practice had a \\"manifest relationship to the employment in question,\\" focusing more narrowly on the job at issue rather than the employers' overall business concerns.   Democrats say a loose definition would encourage discrimination","excerpt":"the White House contends that a definition that makes business necessity difficult to prove would lead employers to use quotas rather than risk losing lawsuits.  Black Caucus: Employers would have to prove that a challenged practice \\"bears a substantial and demonstrable relationship to effective job performance.\\"  Democrats: Employers must prove that the practice has a \\"significant and manifest relationship to the requirements for effective job performance.\\" Those requirements include not only \\"effective performance of the actual work activities\\" but also \\"factors which bear on such performance, such as attendance, punctuality and not engaging in misconduct or insubordination.\\"  Bush: Employers would have their choice of proving either \\"legitimate employment goals,\\" as in Wards Cove case or the \\"manifest relationship\\" rule from Griggs. \\"QUOTAS\\" Issue: The use of numerical quotas in hiring or promotion is generally prohibited. Affirmative actions plans that involve less specific goals and timetables and require employers to make greater efforts to hire and promote women and minorities are generally acceptable. Precise quotas are sometimes acceptable if they are imposed by court order against an employer found to have consistently discriminated in the past. The White House says that the way the Democrats would outlaw quotas would really encourage their use because the Democrats define quotas in a narrow way.  Black Caucus: No provision.  Democrats: Bill states that it does not \\"require or encourage or permit\\" quotas. It also makes their use an \\"illegal employment practice\\" under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Someone denied hiring or promotion because of a quota could sue to get the job and seek damages too.   Quotas are defined as the setting of \\"a fixed number or percentage of persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex or national origin which must be attained, or which cannot be exceeded, regardless of whether such persons meet necessary qualifications to perform the job.\\"  Bush: No direct reference to quotas. DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT Issue: In the 1989 Patterson v. McLean Credit Union case, the Supreme Court held that the right to sue for damages for racial job discrimination under an 1866 law did not apply to on-the-job harassment or other forms of discrimination after someone was hired. Since then, lower courts have disagreed as to whether the law applies to dismissals, promotions and other practices.   Black Caucus: The Patterson decision would be rejected absolutely, and the Reconstruction-era law would be clearly defined as applying to hirings, promotions, dismissals and all other terms of employment.  Democrats: The same. In addition, this proposal makes clear that the provision applies to nongovernmental discrimination as well as discrimination based on state law.  Bush: Identical with Democratic version.  Issue: Victims of intentional discrimination or harassment based on sex, religion, national origin or disability are protected under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, not the 1866 law. All a judge can order is back pay and employment or reinstatement on a job if it was lost. Compensatory and punitive damages are not permitted, and women argue that their claims under this act therefore have less weight  Black Caucus: Amend the 1866 law so that it also covers sex discrimination. Amend the 1964 law to allow compensatory and punitive damages. Either side could request trial by jury.   Democrats: Amend the 1964 law to permit suits for compensatory and punitive damages and back pay. Punitive damages would be limited to $150,000, or the total of back pay and compensatory damages, whichever is higher. Because that would still be less than victims of racial discrimination can seek under the 1866 law, the provision has been attacked as unfair, to women in particular. If either side asked, the case would be tried before a jury.  Bush: Damages would be allowed only in harassment cases, including sexual harassment, and no more than $150,000 in damages would be allowed. But a victim could not sue if he or she had failed to use in-house grievance procedures. The case would be tried before a judge without a jury. Victims of other sorts of intentional discrimination would still be entitled only to back pay and employment or reinstatement. REOPENING OLD DISCRIMINATION CASES Issue: In the 1989 Martin v. Wilks case, the Supreme Court ruled that since some white firefighters in Birmingham, Ala., had not been parties to two earlier suits challenging discrimination in the city's fire department, they had a right to go into court later to attack hiring and promotion policies established by consent decrees that settled the suits.  Black Caucus: People could not sue to reopen employment cases if they had \\"actual notice\\" of the decree at the time it was entered and a \\"reasonable opportunity\\" to object. Nor could they sue if their interests \\"were adequately represented\\" in the original case. Challenges would also not be allowed \\"if reasonable efforts were made to provide notice to interested persons.\\" Democrats: The same.  Bush: Endorses the Martin v. Wilks decision; would write it into a statute. ADJUSTMENTS OF EMPLOYMENT TESTS Issue: In a practice called \\"race norming,\\" the Labor Department has urged state employment services to score the results of a widely used aptitude test separately for white, blacks and people of Hispanic descent. Under this practice, in effect since the beginning of the Reagan Administration, some blacks with low raw scores of correct answers are rated higher than some whites with more correct answers.  Black Caucus: No provision.  Democrats: Prohibit both \\"race norming\\" and the use of biased employment tests that fail to predict job performance equally well, regardless of race, religion, sex or national origin.  Bush: Would prohibit \\"race norming.\\" Major Differences Over Civil Rights"},{"year":"1974","title":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 10.&#8212","excerpt":"The White House counsel, Philip W.

Their three heads collided gaily, musk of sweat and tang of strong sweet soap clapped a mask to her nose and mouth. They all gasped with delicious shock. They were saying things to each other. She put up an arm round each neck, the rough pile of an army haircut on one side, the soft negro hair on the other, and kissed them both on the cheek.   -- From \\"A Soldier's Embrace\\" (1980)  They sickened at the appalling thought that they might find they had lived out their whole lives as they were, born white pariah dogs in a black continent.

They had stayed; and told each other and everyone else that this and nowhere else was home, while knowing, as time left went by, the reason had become they couldn't get their money out -- Bam's growing savings and investments, Maureen's little legacy of De Beers shares her maternal grandmother had left her, the house there was less and less opportunity of selling as city riots became a part of life.   -- From \\"July's People\\" (1981)  I knew that our army had become -- maybe always was -- yes, what you say, a murderous horde that burned hospitals, cut off the ears of villagers, raped, blew up trains full of workers.

If you don't know where to start, try the Baroque Museum in the Mirabell Gardens. It's so new that loins local people may not have heard about it, but they'll know where the gardens are. The museum is an audio&#8208;visual thing, nicely done even if you don't understand German. After the Baroque Museum, no matter how many three&#8208;star and four&#8208;star at tractions you hit, don't fail to see the Collegiate Church (Kollegienkirche), which was designed at the end of the 17th century by Fischer von Erlach, whose name you will hear a hundred times on tours of Vienna and Salzburg. The church was built as the university church and is entered from Universit&#228;tsplatz. Some guidebooks don't even mention it, possibly because their authors were so captivated by the flower stands&#8221; in the square in front of the church entrance that they neglected to notice the church itself. That's a mistake. After looking at the flowers, gaze heavenward at the figures of the Evangelists on the church tower, then walk inside. If you think baroque is all clusters of knickknacks, be proved happily wrong. The church displays great line and simplicity; proportions and symmetry are perfect&#8212;with baroque decorations. The great delight is in discovering that baroque can permit such a clean and simple creation as this. What's Doing in SALZBURG"},{"year":"1920","title":"To celebrate the first anniversary of the Capitol Theatre this week, S. L. Rothapfel is presenting a program of varied interest. It is not, however, notable for its pictures. Though some of these are interesting, they are over-shadowed by musical and dancing numbers, enriched by the stage settings of John Wenger. But as this is a motion picture review, most of its space must be devoted to the screen, so—After a spirited playing of Tchaikovsky's \\"1812\\" overture by the orchestra, and the persuasive singing of three songs by the Russian Cathedral Choir, there comes the always entertaining Capitol News, and then, following \\"Israel\\" sung by Elsie Lyon, the first of the featured pictures, \\"The Art of Diving,\\" with Annette Kellermann illustrating the art. Each movement and position of the diver's performance is brought out by the slow-motion camera, and it is fascinating to observe what the eye ordinarily would miss.A \\"Ballet of Flowers,\\" arranged by Alexander Cumansky and led by Mlle. Gambarelli, is an attractive number, enhanced by colored pictures thrown on a transparent screen in front of the dancers. \\"The Cost of Carelessness,\\" a realistic Prizma picture of a forest fire, follows, and then the photoplay, \\"Madame Peacock,\\" with Nazimova is the two leading rôles.This work, which was adapted by Mme. Nazimova herself, and directed by Ray C. Smallwood, claims derivation from a story by Rita Weiman, but whatever Miss Weiman wrote has been used by Mme. Nazimova to display her own virtuosity. The picture is all Nazimova, in various moods and manners, from the extremely simple to the exaggeratedly affected and exotic. She takes the part of an inordinately self-regarding actress who imagines that the world and all its people revolve around her, and also that of her own simple and unaffected daughter, whom she does not recognize and receive until the hour of her humiliation comes. The picture has been richly staged, and several members of its cast do good work, especially George Probert as the regal star's excluded husband, John Steppling as her discerning manager, and Rex Cherryman as the mere author of one of her plays. But \\"Madame Peacock\\" will not, therefore, give any one an impression of reality. Spectators may enjoy it, because the extravagant Nazimova is frequently enjoyable, but those who know that she can also impersonate a real character must wish that she would do so soon.\\"Such is Life Behind the Scenes of a Circus,\\" a Hy Mayer Travelaugh, accompanied by many and appropriate noises, is amusing, and the program is concluded by Rachmaninoff's \\"Prelude C Sharp Minor\\" played on the organ by Melchiorre Mauro-Cottone.\\"The Great Redeemer,\\" derived from a story by H. H. Van Loan, and directed by Clarence Brown under the supervision of Maurice Tourneur, is the photoplay at the Rivoli. In some respects it is an exceptional picture. It might have been a great deal better, but, also, it might have been much worse, for its subject lends itself either to inspired treatment or cheap exploitation. \\"The Great Redeemer,\\" at any rate, is not cheap, and in a few scenes it comes near to being inspired. For the things in it that are good, chief credit must go to Mr. Tourneur. His skill is in making moving picture scenes tell his story, or vital parts of it, and it is safe to say, for example, that a man's entering a prison to serve a long term and his release by pardon have never been more effectively shown than in \\"The Great Redeemer.\\" Also there must be recognition of the work of House Peters as the story's hero, Marjorie Daw as its heroine, and Joseph Singleton as a condemned murderer. Jack Macdonald, as the villain, has some good scenes, but the excesses of his performance detract from the force of the story.The crisis of \\"The Great Redeemer\\" comes in the prison. A former highwayman, with a talent for sketching, paints a crucifix on the wall of his cell, the figure of which comes to life. The murderer and the highwayman are overwhelmed by the miracle","excerpt":"the whole order of their lives is changed. In this critical scene the work of director, players and camera man is almost faultless, as it must be to save the scene from banality. Whatever one thinks of miracles, and however the strength of the incident in \\"The Great Redeemer\\" is weakened by surrounding melodrama, the spectator cannot but be held at the moment of the story's exaltation.Also on the Rivoli program is a Post Nature Scenic, \\"As Fancy Paints,\\" which entices one's dulled fancy to paint restful scenes and keep them for a while. Nature and the camera have united to make it charming.\\"One Week,\\" a Buster Keaton work, has more fun in it than most slapstick, trick-property comedies.\\"The Devil's Garden,\\" with Lionel Barrymore, is the photoplay at the Strand this week, and \\"The Restless Sex\\" has moved from the Rivoli to the Rialto.

Known in its film form as \\"Four Hours to Kill,\\" the picture is a gripping, although extremely theatrical, melodrama with a neatly dovetailed plot, a uniformly excellent cast and well-paced direction.The film does not attempt to extend itself much beyond the spatial limits of the stage play. The action, for the main, is confined to the lounge of the West Forty-third Street Theatre.

It is in that, and in the subsequent scenes, that the medodrama is at its best.Richard Barthelmess as the convict, Tony Mako, contributes what is probably one of his finest performances. It is fitting, too, that special mention be made of Charles Wilson in the rôle of the human, family-loving detective. Mr. Wilson has long been a mainstay in support of stars and rarely has he received proper credit for his work. Gertrude Michael as the errant wife, Ray Milland as the lover, Joe Morrison as the check-room attendant, Roscoe Karns as the nervous father-to-be and Paul Harvey as the storming detective captain—all contribute largely to the picture's interest.

At least, we have no personal knowledge of any consanguinity with the clan of Yorkshire woollen mill folk who are saliently displayed in this film. That is an affirmation that you will appreciate, we feel sure, as you learn more about this solemn saga that came to the Embassy Forty-second Street on Saturday.For he simple fact is that the Crowthers to whom we are here introduced are a pretty tight lot of enterprisers, with more than one viperous character in the clan. The mean ones are grasping and deceitful, full of pomposity and guile, and even the nice ones are given to a cheerless probity. More than that, they are rigidly addicted to long hours of hard work at low pay, which is probably the most revolting disposition that they reveal.But once these gloomy characteristics are reflected upon impersonally, then this \\"Master of Bankdam\\" emerges as a somberly fascinating tale of a family's internal frictions through three generations and fifty years. And once these crusty Crowthers are accepted as likely Yorkshire types, their struggles for wealth and position become dourly interesting.Not that they or their doings are very different, in basic respects, from the characters or the happenings in any number of other tales of the rise and fall of families in an expanding industrial age. The father, the first of the mill-owning family, is a conventionally autocratic type, endowed with the usual peasant virtues and a solid commercial point of view. He runs his small mill in Yorkshire with the same shrewd economy that he and his wife, a workman's daughter, run their modest home.And his two sons are equally conventional. One is a bright and diligent lad, given to open-handed dealing, and the other is a cold and treacherous drudge. Likewise, the wives of these brothers run pretty true to form","excerpt":"the wife of the first is a darling, the wife of the second is a shrew. There are obvious complications—rivalries, double-crosses, deaths—and a natural continuation of the contention to the sons of the sons. In the end, the family's hard-earned fortunes are saved from disaster and ruin by the son of the good son taking over from the fat-headed son of the bad.As we say, it is all quite familiar, in a flowing Galsworthian vein, and at times it is also quite tedious as the episodes tend to repeat. But happily the producers have set it in a solid atmosphere of a nineteenth century mill town and Victorian society. And a cast of competent actors, under the direction of Walter Forde, play the Yorkshire people with style and authority.Tom Walls is exceptionally forceful as the father of the clan, agitating and aging with drive and integrity. Dennis Price is fluent as the good son, Stephen Murray is bitter as the bad and Nancy Price gives a sure performance as the hard-grained mother of the lads. Anne Crawford and Linden Travers are distinctive as the wives, and Jimmy Hanley and David Tomlinson colorfully portray their sons.We don't want to recommend these Crowthers as the most illustrious bearers of the name, but we've got to admit—these Bankdam mill people make a round and eventful tale.

Here L. & M. loses to Mid West, which in itself is an idea that heightens the interest in the picture.Through a clever juggling of actual crowd scenes at a football game and glimpses of the players struggling on the field, \\"Touchdown!\\" has an atmosphere of reality. The romance between Mary Gehring and Dan Curtis, a young coach, is permitted to shine forth here and there, and insead of interrupting the narrative, it helps.Jack Oakie shoulders most of the comedy in a part that fits his cheery personality. A word from Mr. Oakie and the audience yesterday afternoon laughed heartily. As Babe Barton he is particularly amusing when he is enlisting outside talent for L. & M.'s football team. Several players who have made names for themselves in their respective communities are approached by the indefatigable Babe Barton, who carries a bankroll to tempt the men to join L. & M.'s football squad, with the hope, of course, of making them crack players. This is an idea of L. & M.'s new young coach, Dan Curtis, who declares that such measures must be adopted if the college is to have a winning team.Curtis, nicely played by Richard Arlen, has, according to Pop Stewart, his old coach at Mid West, a bit too much of the will to win. Stewart is considerate of his men and when one has been hurt and still is eager to continue playing Pop gives the player some good advice and insists on keeping him out of the game. Curtis has his measure of success, but his great ambition is to have L. & M. triumph over Mid West. He sends one man, who has injured his knee, into an early game and the player suffers a more serious injury. Tom Hussey calls Curtis a butcher, but the adamant young coach thinks faster than Tom, with the result that the latter topples over with a blow on the chin.A similar temptation occurs in the game between L. & M. and Mid West Paul Gehring, who has suffered what is said to be a slight concussion of the brain in the first half of the contest, is eager to go in again. Curtis thinks it over, in spite of the fact that he has been told that if Paul suffers any further injury it may prove fatal. The coach, however, has learned his lesson, and this time he takes his defeat rather than risk Gehring's life. Instead of winning further fame as the coach of the team that defeated Mid West Dan Curtis wins the heart of Paul's sister Mary, on which fact Babe Barton makes his comment as the picture fades from the screen.J. Farrell MacDonald, who gave a sterling performance in \\"The Spirit of Notre Dame,\\" repeats his good work as Pop Stewart. Charles Starrett fills the rôle of Paul Gehring acceptably. Regis Toomey contributes to the zeal of the playing in the rôle of Tom Hussey. Peggy Shannon is attractive and capable as the girl in the case.Bing Crosby is kept busy crooning during the stage production. \\"Stardust.\\" Another performer in this section of the bill is Armida, who sings in Spanish and English.

Chevalier has not much to say","excerpt":"the William J. Locke novel on which his billet is based took care of that. But the tone of the note is friendly and the photograph on the back of it shows that the French actor has not lost his pout, his wink or his gayety.There is something buoyant about Chevalier on the screen, a debonair, saucy and sunny quality as infectious as it is charming, and perfectly suited to such agreeable trivia as his current film. I would not say that it is impossible not to like him, but I am positive it is an attitude which would require deep concentration to maintain. Even his singing—he sounds more than ever like a frog whose voice is changing—is enjoyably off-key, although in this case the melodies are so undistinguished that we probably should not have been able to catch the tune anyway.Mr. Locke's story, in its present condensation, is the quietly humorous one of a young French architect who goes vagabonding through France to forget an unhappy love affair. During his travels he takes under his wing a Cockney lad with a talent for caricature and a demure country lass who had been trying, with understandable lack of success, to earn her living by singing and dancing in the streets. The trio's adventures in minstrelsy are pleasantly uneventful until the Frenchman's former sweetheart, now widowed, returns for the kill. It is giving away no secret to whisper that the architect realizes in time it is the minstrel girl and a vagabond life that he loves.Assisting Mr. Chevalier in his pastoral romantic comedy are Desmond Tester (the boy king of \\"Nine Days a Queen\\") as the caricaturist, the attractive Marguerite Lockwood as the shy young innocent, Betty Stockfield as the prim ex-fiancée and a few lesser English players. They constitute an appropriate background for Chevalier's livelier talents.

A.Skaters do not really skate on ice. They skate on water. The application of high pressure to ice will cause it to melt. The narrow blades of ice skates serve to concentrate all the weight of the skater on a very small area of ice, which consequently melts directly under the blade of the skate, creating a film of water between the skate and the ice. The skate actually moves on this film. When the skate has passed, releasing the pressure, the film of water promptly returns to the solid state. If the ice is cold enough, however, the pressure may be insufficient to melt it. The consequence should be that the heavier you are, the colder the day on which you can skate, with children running into problems first. The same phenomenon can be demonstrated by putting a heavily weighted wire on a block of ice","excerpt":"the wire will slowly melt its way right through the ice, which will rejoin as a solid right behind the wire.
