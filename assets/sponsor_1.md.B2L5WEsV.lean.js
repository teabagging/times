President Clinton was quick to point out that more than four million new jobs -- the number he pledged to produce by the end of this year -- have been created since he took office. That's all well and good, but he can't take all the credit. Last spring, the economy proved it sometimes has a life of its own","excerpt":"before the Administration was able to present its ill-fated stimulus package to Congress, payrolls jumped in May. Labor Secretary Robert Reich warned then not to \\"put too much weight on a single month's numbers.\\" Last week, he said figures for July are \\"further proof that job growth is continuing its solid, steady course.\\" In July, the economy created 259,000 new jobs, about 60,000 more than consensus forecasts. Average hourly earnings rose by 4 cents, to $11.12. Japan Trade Is a Sticky Situation  Talk about bad timing. The Clinton Administration has decided it's time to get tough with Japan on trade. Last week, it formally accused Japan of discriminating against American companies in awarding some contracts. But the Administration is putting on the gloves amid such dizzying political turmoil in Japan that the Asian target's outline is fuzzy: Japan has had four Prime Ministers in a little more than a year. A former United States trade official said prodding a decision out of the \\"collection of ministries\\" was like \\"punching a marshmallow.\\" In the process, experts say, the dollar could spill the most blood -- if the United States gets so frustrated it drives down the dollar's value to sell more goods in Japan.  Paul Allen's Gizmo Search  Some Lollapalooza goers are getting more than they bargained for this year. Besides jamming to their favorite alternative-rock bands and hanging loose in the summer heat, some will likely help determine what will be the next gadget or two appearing on store shelves everywhere. Last week, Paul Allen -- a software billionaire who cofounded Microsoft and owns Ticketmaster and part of Egghead Software -- flew to Providence, R.I., to check out his $3 million technology exhibition roaming the country with the music fest. His goal is to discover the next big hit in consumer electronics. Among the computerized offerings the concertgoers experienced was the \\"Baby Maker\\" software program, which lets a couple -- regardless of sex -- combine their images digitally to see what their offspring would look like.  Clinton Wants R-E-S-P-E-C-T  Dissatisfied with the little bit of commendation he's getting for the economy's performance, President Clinton last week held a news conference to sing his own praises. The White House also brought out backup vocals: eight top economic officials who touted their agencies' successes in the last 18 months. Commerce Secretary Brown harmonized: \\"I don't think that the President has gotten the credit that he has deserved.\\" Dog Days of Retail  The Gap made a little money in July. The Limited lost a little. But Sears and Woolworth lapped up gains. \\"The trend in July is no trend,\\" one retail analyst remarked. \\"Sales are really all over the board.\\" Those erratic sales leave few clues about where sales are headed. The only thread of the retail story is that diversified retailers -- discounters and department stores -- are doing better than stores that simply sell clothing. Sometimes, much better. The merchandise group at Sears, Roebuck announced it sold more appliances the last week of July than in any other week in its history. COMPANIES Upjohn Pays its Probers  Did too! Did not! Did too! Did not! Whatever happened, Upjohn last week agreed to pay $650,000 to several state investigative agencies.

Upjohn said last week it did nothing wrong in its marketing plan but it would pay eight states -- Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin -- about $84,000 each for their investigative costs.  Time Out at Nasdaq  For 34 minutes one day last week, Nasdaq trading was interrupted after a squirrel chewed through a power line and the stock trading system's backup power system failed to kick in. The hapless squirrel can be forgiven. But can the nation's second-largest stock market? It has, after all, donned the garb of a technological leader and seduced leading high-tech companies -- Intel and Microsoft -- that look mighty alluring on its arm. And the outage was only one of three technological breakdowns at Nasdaq since July 14.  Cyanamid Gets the Looks  Not long ago, American Cyanamid's dance card was empty. (Earlier this decade, when the company's focus was on manufacturing chemicals, it was an outcast that watched its stock price slide for two dreadfully long years.) In came a new C.E.O., who in the last 18 months has transformed the concern into a health care and agricultural products company by cutting costs and shedding sorry divisions. The makeover worked. Last week, American Home Products presented American Cyanamid with a surprise, $8.5 billion cash takeover offer, causing the company's stock to soar more than 40 percent. Several more suitors may be lining up. Securities experts say European drug and chemical concerns like Bayer, Ciba-Geigy, Hoechst and Zenaca could offer even better propositions. MGM Puts Faith in Vegas  How obsessed are Americans with gambling? Very, MGM and Primadonna Resorts suggested last week when they bet $300 million on yet another Vegas gambling center. (MGM itself just opened the nation's biggest casino resort there six months ago, at a cost of $1 billion.) The latest casino -- New York-New York -- is also one in a string of projects taking shape while Las Vegas luxuriates in a record summer. \\"This is a sign of confidence in the Las Vegas market,\\" said a University of Las Vegas professor, \\"but this rush-ahead, rush-ahead philosophy is a gamble, and the fact that MGM cut someone else in indicates that they think it is something of a crap shoot, too.\\" What Now for Barry Diller?  It's a done deal -- unless a more generous offer surfaces in the next month. Barry Diller's QVC, the home shopping channel, is set to be taken over by the cable television giants Tele-Communications Inc. and Comcast. If a better bid does come along, QVC would pay TCI and Comcast a $55 million breakup fee. Otherwise, as agreed last week, the cable duo will snare QVC for $2.5 billion. Ever since Diller joined QVC as chairman about a year and a half ago, he has been seeking a partner. He also courted Home Shopping Network, Paramount Communications and CBS. The restless Diller is not expected to stay. INTERNATIONAL Out of (South) Africa, Still  Jailed, he inspired song and sit-ins. The personification of how blacks were persecuted under apartheid in South Africa, he was the torch investor activists and students carried to light fires under American companies to divest themselves of operations there. But now that Nelson Mandela is free and leading his country, he can't get investors' attention. Last week -- 10 months after he formally invited foreign business to return -- a snapshot of investment activity since April showed more foreign money flowing out than in, despite the fact that advance scouts of Western dough last year promised investment if peace prevailed and Mandela embraced the free market. Now, potential investors complain about things like a costly labor force and trade barriers.  China Market's Painful Start   When the Chinese Communist Government held its reborn stock market by the feet and slapped its bottom to get it breathing in 1990, China was unprepared for the challenge -- and pains -- the market would bring once it started walking. While the market created quick fortunes for a handful of investors and hit record highs early last year, it wasn't long before it took a fall. Recent months brought a near collapse, and when many first-time Chinese investors panicked and sold off shares, they lost their life savings. Last week, however, the index for the Chinese-only A shares more than doubled. Some frustrated investors vowed to abandon the market and its vagaries. And others talked about \\"winning\\" back their losses.

Indeed, the economy's grim prospects could prove the Achilles' heel of the new regime.    The emergency committee's vow to clean the streets of \\"squanderers of the national wealth\\" -- an ironic echo of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's early war on corruption -- might scare some farmers and factory managers into delivering the goods and temporarily curb their diversion to black markets. And the more pragmatic bureaucrats who serve the new regime might imagine a Chinese- or Chilean-style economic liberalization that secures the position of the ruling elite.  'Economic Primitives'     But Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard researcher with close ties to Polish reformers, scoffs at the prospect. He dismisses the coup's leaders as \\"economic primitives\\" lacking the power to cope with the immediate problem of exploding prices or the knowledge to remake the failed system of production and distribution. And he points out that leaders who earlier this year attacked foreign investors as plunderers will not be able to look westward for help.    The economy Mr. Gorbachev inherited in 1985 offered its citizens a living standard roughly comparable to that of Mexico or Poland, one so wasteful that it was unable to grow in spite of rates of saving and investment that would put the thrifty Japanese to shame. The economy Mr. Gorbachev bequeaths produces even less, and seems on the verge of unraveling in a gale of inflation.    One reason Mr. Gorbachev accomplished so little in economic terms, argues Lawrence Summers, the chief economist of the World Bank, is that he tried so little. In the early years he played the role of Stalin with a human face, asserting that socialism could be saved if only the proletariat would pull up its socks. Later he promulgated sweeping plans to pension off Moscow's bureaucrats, decentralize production decisions and allow wholesale prices to be set by markets. But these bold initiatives were largely ignored by the planners. And rather than fight, Mr. Gorbachev generally switched to the new and improved version served up by new and improved advisers.    The other reason, Mr. Summers suggests, is that perestroika's great political success, the attenuation of the Communist Party's authority, damaged the old-boy network that kept cheap bread and sausage on the store shelves. And the resulting loss of power without a parallel strengthening of markets to discipline economic decision-making put the Soviet Union on the path to hyperinflation.    Enterprises were allowed to pay workers more, while bureaucrats were unable to say no when enterprise managers demanded that the resulting losses be financed with freshly printed rubles. Meanwhile, output fell because Moscow was unable to micromanage deliveries of critical materials or to prevent hoarding within factories -- or republics. But spendable income skyrocketed, lengthening the lines for staples sold at low fixed prices and dramatically increasing incentives to divert goods into the black market.    To cope with the crisis of too many rubles chasing too few goods, Mr. Gorbachev decreed sharp increases in prices in April. According to PlanEcon, a Washington consulting firm, the price reform raised the cost of living by 74 percent over the January 1991 level, enough to take the steam out of inflation if wage increases were held to prescribed levels, production was maintained and taxes collected by republics were channeled back to the national budget.    But those were all big \\"ifs.\\" According to official Soviet statistics, output in the first half of 1991 was 12 percent smaller than in the first half of 1990. Russia and the Ukraine, the largest republics, have thus far withheld 1991 tax payments to Moscow. And before the coup the Soviet Ministry of Finance projected a budget deficit equal to 15 percent of national output.    Hard-liners backed by the military and the K.G.B. might be expected to have more leverage to break Soviet inflation and restore economic order, the way Gen. Augusto Pinochet stabilized prices and made Chile safe for capitalism. But Mr. Summers argues that \\"it is absurd to think they will produce a Chilean-style miracle.\\"  Food and Housing Cited     The budget deficit can be cut, Mr. Summers explains, only by a government that is prepared to reduce living standards or deny some entrenched interest its expected slice of the pie. He doubts that the junta, which yesterday declared its \\"prime concern is the solution of food and housing problems,\\" is prepared to test its legitimacy by paring consumption. And he finds it unlikely that a government brought to power by the Red Army could slash the No. 1 item in the budget, military procurement.    Mr. Gorbachev used imports, financed by exports and loans, to absorb excess purchasing power. But Keith Crane, an economist at PlanEcon, points out that this source of sustenance was already closing for Mr. Gorbachev and is likely to slam shut on the new government.    Imports fell 45 percent in 1990, largely because oil exports fell sharply and the Government could not borrow extra cash from wary foreign banks. This year Mr. Crane estimates that $20 billion in principal and interest on private foreign loans will come due","excerpt":"before the coup Moscow was none too subtly hinting that it would need to stretch out repayments.  End of Hope for Foreign Goods     Sometime this year, Mr. Crane predicts, \\"the Soviets are going to stiff their creditors,\\" and in the process end the hope of infusions of foreign goods to tame the inflation beast.    But Mr. Sachs argues that \\"even if they got the budget right, they'd solved nothing.\\" Whoever is in charge must get the economy growing again. And while Mr. Sachs concedes the new leaders \\"may find a way to make the trains run on time,\\" they haven't a clue about creating free markets or making them work. None of the members of the emergency committee are trained in Western economics and none have been associated with reform-minded members of the Gorbachev Government.    President Gorbachev hoped to enlist foreign business in the transition. Hundreds of joint ventures, most of them European, are already operating, and this summer the prohibition against majority enterprise control by foreigners was lifted. Sufficient Pragmatism Seen     Michael Claudon, the president of Geonomics, a Vermont foundation specializing in Soviet economics, says that Acting President Gennadi I. Yanayev is sufficiently pragmatic to press the initiative. And he says that \\"a strong central government could be good for Western business.\\"    But Mr. Claudon concedes that it would take a lot of convincing to entice foreigners to invest in the junta: \\"All the momentum that was building over the past few months is lost,\\" he said.    Faced with the certain loss of power and perquisites, the old guard was obviously prepared to run the gantlet of foreign and domestic hostility. But \\"this was a coup without an ideology,\\" argues Mr. Crane, one that cannot be sustained on dreams of a \\"socialist nirvana.\\" Eventually, he predicts, they will be forced to go with what works. And in the 1990's, that means democratic capitalism.

Although he has reined in the rhetorical excesses of his early years, he has never ceased to experiment with form and content. His subjects have included love and sex in their many guises and the central role of language in the human comedy.

Until the inevitable intrusion of soccer, basketball and other Western sports, it was the country's only sport. But for three days each summer, newfangled games are forgotten and all attention focuses on the town of Edirne, where rollicking spectators watch greasy wrestlers lathered with olive oil (the better for reaches to exceed grasps) compete at the Kirkpinar festival. Edirne's glory dates from the Ottoman Empire's first thrust into Europe. As legend has it, a commander, Suleyman Pasha, decamped in a field near the town, and his squad of 40 men began wrestling to pass the time. Whether the warriors used oil is unrecorded, but as they competed, two wrestlers collapsed and died. The two were buried where they fell, and when a spring of clear water spouted from the site, it became known as Kirkpinar, \\"40 springs,\\" in honor of the young Turks.

Were these the natives I have decided to seek this strange season? I had planned to talk to them, ask them how they felt about baseball now, about the Yankees, if their fandom had been damaged by the strike, but the game has rhythms to lull any resolve and I ended up merely there.

His re-emergence is part of a restoration of the 65-year-old Steinway Building, between Seventh Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, designed by Warren & Wetmore. Within an arch above the central showroom window -- in which Steinway & Sons still displays its pianos -- there is a sculptural grouping by Leo Lentelli, with Apollo, a Muse and allegorical figures symbolizing the emotional range of music. After the Manhattan Life Insurance Company bought the 16-story structure from Steinway in 1958, it installed a panel in the arch with its logotype in the center.   The building's current owners, a partnership including several senior managing directors at Bear Stearns, had already begun a renovation of the building when they lured the Economist magazine as a tenant, with the understanding that the publication would get its name on the facade. During a probe behind the panel, it was determined that the sculpture still existed. The Economist decided that it ought to be revealed. Some hands, feet and noses had been damaged but Ron J. Lessman, the owners' representative, said thankfully that \\"most of it is intact and can be restored.\\"   Above the arch is a panel that once proclaimed \\"STEINWAY.\\" This was recarved by Manhattan Life to say \\"FOUNDED 1850.\\" It will be recarved again to say \\"THE ECONOMIST.\\" Postings: Steinway Building Restoration","excerpt":"Behind a Panel -- Apollo"},{"year":"1985","title":"NICARAGUA: Revolution in the Family.\\n\\nBy Shirley Christian. 337 pages. Random House. $19.95. The debate over Nicaragua continues, but its focus has changed. No longer do we argue whether the Sandinistas are Marxists. Instead, we now discuss whether United States policy left them no alternative. ''Nicaragua: Revolution in the Family,'' by the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Shirley Christian, now a reporter assigned to the Washington bureau of The New York Times, should lay this debate to rest as well. Miss Christian's highly readable account provides convincing evidence that the Sandinista leaders ''intended to establish a Leninist system from the day they marched into Managua.''\\n\\nThe idea that the Sandinistas were pushed toward radicalism ignores the early sequence of events. As Miss Christian shows, the foundations of the current system were laid while Jimmy Carter was still President, before Ronald Reagan was even nominated and well before President Reagan authorized Central Intelligence Agency backing for the so-called contras. The Sandinistas almost immediately took control of and expanded military and security functions with the help of Cuban advisers. The Cubans also helped them create a network of mass organizations characteristic of Marxist dictatorships and to reshape Nicaragua's education system. Internationally, the Sandinistas aligned themselves with Cuba and the Soviet Union.

So when I contemplated making another trip to Tuscany this year, Lucca struck me as a quieter, potentially less expensive alternative. \\n\\n     Around the time I arrived on a train from Pisa, one of the hourly trains from Florence was also pulling into the station, letting off a somewhat thin stream of day-trippers. Later I discovered that tour buses had found the city, too, and I met longtime Lucca aficionados who complained that their Tuscan secret was out. But in September, at least, I never encountered overpowering crowds. A film company had settled in to shoot Henry James's \\"The Portrait of a Lady\\" with Nicole Kidman, and crew members had claimed almost every room at the Universo, the town's main hotel, but it was easy to avoid the hubbub they created. Besides, by about 4 in the afternoon, the movie people had packed up and the day-trippers had gone home, leaving Lucca to me and the Lucchesi. Shouldering my backpack (which contained just enough gear for a three-day stay) and exiting the train station, I was immediately greeted by yet another reason why any Tuscan traveler might want to stop in Lucca -- its walls, built from about 1550 to 1650 to protect the little town that had prospered in the silk trade from belligerent neighbors like Florence and Pisa. Made of dusky brown brick 13 feet high, they form a two-and-a-half-mile belt around central Lucca and are wide enough to accommodate an avenue lined by mature plane trees on top -- now a delightful city park where matrons play cards, the evening stroll (a seldom neglected custom known as the \\"passeggiata\\") is undertaken, and sightseers trace the hazy  outlines of the Apuan Alps to the north.

The voter registration and voting history of the state clearly favored Representative James J. Florio, Democrat of Runnemede, as did polls a month before the election, which showed him with a 12-point advantage over his Republican opponent, Thomas H. Kean, Republican of Livinston.   But by election day, Mr. Kean, a former Assembly Speaker, had drawn nearly even, or perhaps ahead.  Here, based on interviews with campaign aides, information from last month's New York Times poll of New Jersey and impressions collected on the campaign trail, are some of the reasons for the hair-thin margins:   Basic strategy: The basic fact of political life in New Jersey is that enrolled Democrats outnumber enrolled Republicans 2 to 1, a situation that has helped elect Democrats - usually by substantial margins - to the state house in six of the last seven gubernatorial elections.   Mr. Florio and his advisers coupled that with another piece of knowledge: that the less voters know about the individual candidates and their positions, the more likely they are to vote on the basis of their traditional party affiliations, or on the perceptions they have of how the parties stand on the issues that most concern them.

For most of its running time, actually, the director David C. Thomas manages to keep the film charging ahead of the wastrel clichés that dot VH1's video tribute to rock 'n' roll wreckage because we're not just using one eye to catch a cobbled-together archive about Milli Vanilli or some band that beat the odds to one-hit wonderland. Rather, the proto-punk warriors known as the MC5 left a dent that outlasts their mostly negligible records sales, and the director's curiosity is piqued by the group's sociological impact. The band's members &#151; Wayne Kramer, Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith, Rob Tyner, Michael Davis and Dennis Thompson &#151;  were caught up in the desires that ensnare most musicians: drugs and love of the audience. But for most of them, delivering body blows to the dozing status quo was as much a part of the motivation as any other. Such an ideal seems particularly quaint and, despite the fury from Smith and Tyner, attractively ingenuous. As depicted in &quot;Testimonial,&quot; the robust clash of ideology and ego &#151;  or the heart and the loins &#151;  is a great story, a shower of sparks. More important, given the crass commercial thrust of music these days, a band pursuing anything other than Soundscan numbers is such an unusual tale, it's surprising a dramatic version of the MC5 lifespan, which flamed out in 1972, has yet to be announced. With the aptly titled &quot;MC5: A True Testimonial,&quot; Mr. Thomas captures the taste for revolt in Detroit that inspired the MC5, a desperation that fueled more important pop figures (besides just Motown artists) than maybe in any other city &#151;  an outlaw eruption that ranged from Parliament/Funkadelic to Iggy Pop.

At the same time, it has been treated as a sinister superstition that has helped stifle the development of Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, and contributed mightily to its long history of misery and misrule.          In truth, Vodou (or voodoo, as it is more generally known) has little to do with the images of freakish debauchery often rendered in history books and by Hollywood. Vodou offers a system of beliefs that provides both meaning and solace, qualities that are in short supply in a country with no public schools,  few working sewers, no public transportation, little industry and no good roads. It is also highly eclectic: in an effort to recreate their religious culture in  Haiti, African slaves expropriated a huge repertory of influences, including bits and pieces from the indigenous Taino Indians, from Roman Catholicism, Freemasonry and European mysticism.

Lunchtime talk was mostly of discounts and freight rates and currency fluctuations, but three middle-aged Chinese at a corner table paused between servings of steamed prawns and beef Szechuan-style to take up a matter that has become almost all-consuming among the colony's middle class: how to obtain foreign passports or other papers that would allow them to emigrate more easily.

But there's a lot more to this documentary, not least an interview with George C. Wolfe, the show's writer and director, who describes in detail what he set out to do. Opinions may vary about the extent of his success, but there can be no doubting the intelligence behind the effort.    Born in New Orleans around 1890, Ferdinand Le Menthe (Jelly Roll) Morton was the son of a middle-class, racially mixed Creole family, very much part of a rigid class system that looked down its nose at ordinary, dark-skinned blacks. Raised on French opera and classical piano lessons, Morton drifted early on to the city's French Quarter with its African street rhythms and brothel blues. Banished from his family, he absorbed the sounds that later would emerge in his own music. He would always claim that he \\"invented\\" jazz.

The fabric is swagged, twisted and ruched, or pleated.   Wrapping vases first occurred to Mr. Robba in 1979. \\"I was supposed to design some arrangements of silk flowers in a salon and, when the vases came, they were the wrong color,\\" he said. \\"It was too late to do anything about it, so I wrapped them in fabric.\\"   Mr. Robba, who has 15 boutiques in France, is particularly well known in Japan, where he has 100 shops. His asymmetrical sprays of silk flowers, berries and weeds appeal to the Japanese, whose interest in ikebana, the art of flower design, dates to the 13th century.   \\"In Japan, ikebana is deeply rooted, but the new generation wants to break away from tradition,\\" Mr. Robba said. \\"I brought them movement and freedom.\\" In his arrangements, he said, flowers tumble precariously as if they had been tossed about by a storm and are just regaining their balance.    At his new shop, which bears his name, an arrangement of silk flowers tucked into a wrapped vase starts at $90. The burgundy-and-gold velvet-wrapped vase, above, is $1,000.

Mr. Ney has become the most visible elected target of the broad Justice Department inquiry into corruption and influence-peddling in Washington    A1    Spy Data Led to Dead Ends  In the anxious months after the Sept. 11 attacks, the National Security Agency began sending a steady stream of telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and names to the F.B.I. in search of terrorists.

A1    Protests at March for King  Protesters wore yellow and black armbands in disapproval of the inclusion of Air Force jets at the end of San Antonio's 20th annual march honoring the Rev.

E1    Oprah Announces Next Book  Oprah Winfrey announced that her next book club selection was ''Night,'' the autobiographical account of life in the Nazi death camps by Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who has tirelessly campaigned to keep alive the memory of the Holocaust.

One well-mannered project, an apartment on the top two floors and roof of a neo-classical town house on the Upper East Side, recently completed by the Boston architects Rodolfo Machado and Jorge Silvetti, is very much in keeping with the style of the 1902 limestone building. Both inside and in the outside roof area, the basic principles of neo-classical architecture - a strict sense of symmetry and proportion - and the use of such ornamentation as classical columns and trellis work are reinterpreted, 1980's style.   This apartment is just one good example of a current philosophy being widely practiced by architects in different ways. Some, like Allan Greenberg of Connecticut, design with the delicacy of a surgeon - making the renovation of a century-old house seem as though no modern architect had ever touched it. Then there are far bolder spirits, such as the New York architect Robert A. M. Stern, whose imagination is fueled by historic ornamentation.
