Having lasted for eight and a half hours, you're also going to be pretty pleased with your own stamina. Yet, in the end, your greatest admiration may be for this production's unseen host, Charles Dickens. ''Nicholas Nickleby'' honors this writer by bringing much of his third novel to the stage - and it may honor him even more when it fails. It takes an artist of genius to escape a great theatrical troupe's most Herculean attempts to pin him down.   The Royal Shakespeare Company is remarkable, and the evidence can be found in every nook and cranny of the Plymouth Theater these days and nights. ''Nicholas Nickleby'' contains maybe a dozen performances that will fix Dickens's characters for a lifetime. Two gifted directors, Trevor Nunn and John Caird, and their equally imaginative designers have miraculously staged the show to match Dickens's narrative technique - a technique that in many ways anticipated the story-telling fluidity of movies. They also choreograph space, bodies and light to immerse the audience totally in the atmosphere of Dickens's 19th-century world.

So what will senior officials say on Tuesday morning when North Korea opens its long-delayed negotiations with the West? ''I can just see it now,'' said one of those officials, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the talks. ''They come in, throw a newspaper from the other day on the table, and bellow: 'How can America demand that we give up all our nukes, while you just let the Indians keep all of theirs?'''     It's not an unreasonable question. The long-term implications of Mr. Bush's decision may not be clear for years, and some short-term risks seem evident to critics now. The timing is particularly awkward, in a summer of extraordinary tension with North Korea and Iran. ''Asia is the continent with just about the most complicated nuclear problems we have: India and Pakistan, North Korea and Iran,'' said Joseph Cirincione, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''And by accepting India as a de facto nuclear weapons state, you are telling other countries that if they just hang tough, and put up with sanctions for a while, sooner or later they will be rewarded with status and military power. Is that the message the Bush administration wants to send?'' India is no North Korea. It is a democracy. And unlike Pakistan, which gave rise to the biggest nuclear proliferation ring in history, it has kept strict control of its nuclear stockpile and its bomb-making technology. But the fact remains that for decades India flouted the world's nuclear safeguards. It ran a huge, secret nuclear weapons program, made easier by its refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It built its weapons by diverting material from civilian nuclear plants -- just what the United States says Iran is doing. Iran denies it, but so did India -- until it conducted nuclear tests. Still, as a matter of realpolitik, the administration argued, it has become silly not to acknowledge, at least implicitly, that India is a nuclear-armed state. ''Our national interests have been intersecting,'' said R.Nicholas Burns, under secretary of state for political affairs, who spent months working out elements of the deal, including India's commitment to allow inspectors to visit its civilian nuclear facilities (but not its military stockpiles) and to adhere to provisions of the non-proliferation treaty that are designed to prevent further leakage of nuclear technology.

Can union leaders be expected to sit by without trying to get a share in the bonanza for their members? Are members likely to allow the leadership to be moderate in its demands even if it were so inclined? \\n\\n The resurgence of profits, to be sure, started from abysmally low levels to which they had dropped in late 1982, far below their historic relation to the gross national product. The nation's wage bill, meanwhile, had continued to advance, although more slowly. Indeed, the average worker's pay, adjusted for inflation, was up perceptibly in 1982 for the first time since 1977. Nevertheless, the average wage earner is likely to feel that he is being left behind by rising profits. \\n\\nIf the profit surge brings a new wage surge, the ground will have been prepared for a new wave of inflation. Many companies will be able to give good increases and many will be prepared to pay so as to avoid strikes.

The reason, according to analysts at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, is relatively simple: Most consumers can no longer afford to buy such items as new homes and automobiles.   At the trough of the 1973-75 recession, average mortgage rates were just over 9 percent and the median price of a new home was $38,000.  Assuming a 25 percent downpayment, principal and interest payments on the typical mortgage totaled $250 a month, or roughly 25 percent of median household income, which was $13,700 then. Even at that level, Marc M. Goloven, an economist at Manufacturers Hanover, says that financial constraints kept roughly 40 percent of all potential buyers out of the new-home market.

When Kia began establishing American dealers in the mid-1990's, it mainly attracted buyers -- usually young, on a tight budget, or both -- in need of few-frills starter cars. For about the price of a used late-model vehicle, these shallow-pocket customers could drive away with a factory warranty and that new-car smell.    That's all changing. Sure, Kia still claims the lowest-priced sedan sold in America, the $9,995 Rio, but with the introduction in 2001 of the midsize Optima, followed a year later by the Sedona minivan, Kia is gamely bootstrapping itself out of the basement -- even a full-size family sedan, the Amanti, is on the way. But Kia's best shot at breaking into the big leagues may be the 2003 Sorento, a midsize sport utility that extends Kia's reputation for creating vehicles that deliver a lot of equipment for relatively little money.

Leisure has its martial moments in Japan and the Mount Fuji climb -- everyone should do it once, the saying goes, and only fools do it again -- may be Japanese group recreation at its most regimented. And it is a mentality that the Government hopes is part of a passing era. Even before France's Prime Minister, Edith Cresson, declared the Japanese relentless \\"economic animals\\" seeking to \\"dominate the world\\" with their workaholic habits, a halfhearted campaign began here to convince the country to relax.

Stanley's successful search for the unlost missionary, Dr. David Livingstone, is one which, on the whole, celebrates worthily the story of perhaps the toughest news assignment in journalistic history. Intelligent and restrained and dignified, even to the point of playing down the moment which brought forth that favorite quotation: \\"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?\\", \\"Stanley and Livingstone\\" (at the Roxy) is the best break the Fourth Estate has had on the screen since the beginning of the Stereotype Era.Incidentally, Spencer Tracy is an equally nice thing to happen to the profession, which ought to acquire a better tone simply from the fact that a good actor used to be a newspaperman. The temptation to let the pendulum passively swing from the customary flippant-souse to the other, even less bearable, Richard Harding Davis extreme, must have been a great one, but Zanuck et Cie, have sternly put it aside in favor of simplicity, honesty and good taste. All in all, \\"Stanley and Livingstone\\" represents rather a fine renunciation of cheap dramatics by a studio which occasionally in the past has shown an inclination toward overindulgence. Let us hope that it marks the beginning of a reformation.The life of Henry Stanley, like the lives of many great men, seems to have been marred for cinematic uses by a paucity of romantic detail. Mr. Zanuck, however, has remedied that, with his usual generosity. We do not know what authority he may have, if any, for Nancy Kelly, whom Stanley, it seems, loves in vain, because of the dimples of Richard Greene. But neither do we see how any one could be so officious as to demand that the presence of an actress so charming, so capable and so mature, for all her youth, must also be supported by documents. Equally, the character of Charles Coburn, as the jealous but finally quite sporting British rival of James Gordon Bennett Jr., amusingly justifies itself.We can cheerfully accept the portentous meeting of the royal geographers, and the cablegram establishing Livingstone's existence by announcing his death, which arrives just in time to turn repudiation and ridicule into cheers","excerpt":"why quibble about dates? But the spectacle of Henry Stanley, whom the natives knew as \\"Bula Matari,\\" the unswervable—saddened, prematurely aged, disappointed in love—going back to Africa to carry on Dr. Livingstone's unfinished missionary business—that is really too much. Stanley did go back, but he went to carve out a continent and prepare a route for empire; his achievements finally were those of a great geographer, not of an amateur salvationist. Mr. Zanuck's \\"Onward Christian Soldiers\\" conclusion therefore was merely for the sake of a touching finale, and is not warranted by the facts. It seems rather important in such matters that even the cinema should endeavor to keep the record straight.At the Teatro HispanoIn \\"La Ultima Melodia\\" (The Last Melody), now at the Teatro Hispano, one has a genuine Ibero-American production. Made in Cuba for the Cubanas, S.

Alberto Garrido and Federico Piñero supply much of the fun as a pair of impecunious artists who take care of Lolita after her father's demise.

That certainly seemed the case in both Brussels and Budapest in recent days, when the Russians were accused of violating a cardinal rule of diplomacy: Never surprise your friends.    Much as Nikita S. Khrushchev once railed against his enemies to get their attention, President Boris N. Yeltsin, in Budapest, denounced NATO expansion as anti-Russian and warned of the dangers of a one-superpower world. A few days before, in Brussels, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev had stunned NATO by refusing to sign on to a plan for ushering Russia into military cooperation with it.    To explain such unruly conduct, consider the possibility that the end of Communism hasn't transformed the West and the Russians into friends. And that, for all their good intentions, they have different ways of seeing the world, different fears to calm, different domestic needs to meet. In that case, the reasonable thing to do might be to get their differences on the table in plain language for the sake of -- remember the phrase? -- peaceful coexistence.    Consider, too, that if surprises are alien to diplomacy, they are indispensable in politics. Although Mr. Yeltsin might have found a nicer way and a better time to say it, he certainly captured his audience's attention by declaring that \\"Europe, which has not yet thrown off the legacy of the cold war, is in danger of plunging into a cold peace.\\" That is one way of saying that even though Russia has sworn allegiance to democracy, it is still driven by its own interests.     Humiliated by the loss of its empire, embittered by the sad shape of its economy, Russia's leaders have rediscovered the political power of nationalism and are determined to recover at least some of their influence in their own back yard.     Sobered by the new assertiveness in Russia's foreign policy, mindful of Moscow's history of expansionism, the Western powers have begun to realize that Moscow cannot be counted on as a reliable strategic partner.    Mr. Yeltsin's speech laid bare all the suspicions: If there are no blocs, splits, enemies or suspicions, why do you in the West still need NATO? Why shouldn't Russia be the eastern pillar of European security? In his view, moving the Western alliance eastward is just an American-led plot to isolate Russia in case it turns undemocratic again. That may overstate Western assumptions about NATO, but it is precisely why a number of Central European countries are clamoring to get in.    \\"We often say we don't want to create new lines in Europe,\\" said Poland's Foreign Minister, Andrzej Olechowski. \\"But the lines exist.\\" Between the lines are what Mr. Olechowski calls the \\"gray zone\\" -- countries like Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia -- and his priority is to move this zone behind NATO's protective line.    From the American standpoint, NATO is still the center of Europe's security universe. Why? Because Russia, it seems, cannot be trusted completely. Mr. Clinton essentially said that in Budapest, where he called on Europeans to \\"guard against the assertion of hegemony or spheres of influence.\\"    Despite public claims to the contrary, American officials do not expect Russia to lobby -- or qualify -- for admission to a NATO that has such goals. Why, one senior Administration official in Budapest was asked. \\"History,\\" he said.    No one knows that better than the Russians themselves. In an article last week in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Galina Sidorova, Mr. Kozyrev's top political adviser, wrote that the West has not followed through on its promises of \\"partnership\\" because of Russia's \\"peculiarity.\\"    \\"The problem, in my opinion, is that even quite sincere well-wishers in the West on the surface attribute Russia's 'peculiarity' to its geography, geopolitical situation, the scale of its military and economic potential, and the cataclysms it is living through, while implying something else, which remains unspoken: a certain threat of instability and hostility coming from an allegedly eternal incompatibility with the surrounding world.\\"    Russia's recent posturing has left American policy makers angry, puzzled and split among themselves. But the Clinton Administration's measure of success for its Russia policy has always been a modest one: keep Russia on a steady course toward greater democracy and free markets, in small steps, while understanding that there will be backpedaling and bumps along the way.    Forgiveness    The Administration has also tended to forgive Mr. Yelstin and Mr. Kozyrev their verbal excesses, if only because those two are seen as Russia's best hope. So officials in Washington took heart last week when Mr. Yeltsin wrote Mr. Clinton in the midst of the dust-up that \\"The Russia-NATO partnership will be concluded.\\"    Still, that begged the question of how best to air, and in the process defuse, the suspicions both sides have. Russia's tug-of-war style of doing business is deeply frustrating to some American policy makers who, however much they want to see Mr. Yeltsin succeed, are getting tired of the damage control the relationship requires.    They wonder if the Russians can be trusted when they reject a proposal at the Budapest summit to condemn the Bosnian Serbs, press for lifting of economic sanctions against Iraq, and assert a historic right to intervene in their former empire.     One person who understands the new reality is Warren Christopher. The night before the all-European summit in Budapest, the normally calm and deliberate Secretary of State discovered that the Russians were threatening to block Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and immediately went operational. Alarmed that the move would rob the European summit meeting of its only clear-cut success and embarrass President Clinton, he jumped into his limousine to confront Mr. Kozyrev with a blunt message: No stunts. The Russians backed down.    But Russia's message had been delivered: Don't take our cooperation for granted when you cozy up to our neighbors. We just don't trust you enough. In that chilly atmosphere, Mr. Clinton would be hard-pressed to repeat the assessment he made when he stood with Mr. Yeltsin outside the White House less than three months ago: that the relationship with Russia was \\"at last, remarkably, a normal one.\\" The World","excerpt":"Why Russia Still Bangs Its Shoe"},{"year":"1998","title":"Sarah Hymowitz letter on dire economic circumstances and domestic violence that pushes Russian women intoprostitution abroad (S) Tough Sanctions Can Halt Trafficking in Humans","excerpt":"Why Russians Leave"},{"year":"1988","title":"LEAD: MADISON AVENUE was alive with drama last week, as top executives at Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein defected from the shop's British parent, WPP Group P.L.C., and set up their own firm.

It is certain that Marge Schott embarrasses her fellow owners by her insensitive, boorish and bigoted remarks. Bud Selig, a fellow owner with the conflict-of-interest title of acting commissioner, said earlier this week, \\"Yes, she has hurt baseball, no question about it.\\" If ever someone has advertised her ignorance it is the baseball team owner Marge Schott. She is on record of making slurs toward blacks, Jews, working women, Italians, Asians -- and these are only the ethnic and racial groups that she was asked about. As far back as 1992, she remarked to me that \\"Hitler was good in the beginning,  but he went too far.\\" That was one of the particulars in the indictment that got her suspended from baseball for a year in 1993. When on opening day this season in Cincinnati, the umpire John McSherry collapsed and died on the field in the first inning, and the game was canceled,  she complained, \\"First it was snow, and now this!\\" It was as if she believed God was conspiring against her having a decent opening day. And when she sent the umpires flowers in an attempt to make up, the flowers were discovered to have been recycled. A television station had sent them to her the  day before. Many people who know her describe her as a lonely widow, without children, and with a drinking problem. All this may be true. But in my time spent with Marge Schott, I have found her to be a person of firm convictions and with a pittance of information. She knew as little about Hitler, for example, as she did the infield fly rule. As for her drinking: When she made that Hitler remark to me, it was 10 in the morning, she was driving a car and driving it straight, under the influence of nothing but her simple, unworldly, minimally educated self. She does, however, appear to have a quirky if not crafty business sense. Her fellow owners will tell you that she knows nothing about how to run an organization. But if people are so set against her, then they would not, or should not, show up to her team's games. But they do. Last season, in the smallest metropolitan market of the 14 National League teams, the Reds had a home attendance of 1.8 million fans and outdrew eight of Schott's competitors, including the New York Mets, by 500,000. Her fellow owners will tell you that she knows nothing about baseball. But in the 11 full seasons she has owned the Reds, they have been winners. And in the 1990's, only the Atlanta Braves have a better on-the-field record than the Reds. And while the Reds are in last place this season and playing only .400 ball, they won their division last year -- the same twist experienced by the Boston Red Sox. Schott has the lowest ticket prices in all of baseball and has insisted on fans  being able to buy a hot dog at Riverfront Stadium for a dollar. An organization  in Chicago called the Fan Cost Index figured out that for a family of four to attend a ball game -- from tickets to parking to popcorn -- the Reds have the lowest total average cost: $81.31. The average is $102.58, with the Yankees coming in at $117.32 and the Mets at $104.80. As for hurting baseball, what hurt baseball more than the owners calling off the World Series in 1994? What hurt them more financially than the $280 million they had to pay the players for illegally colluding to hold down salaries? And not one owner had to relinquish control of his club, or was suspended for it, either. And just who are these fellow owners sitting in judgment of her? The admitted felon in the Bronx? Ted Turner of Atlanta, who urinated in public after his America's Cup yacht racing victory? The owners would distinguish themselves not by taking club control away from Schott, or by suspending her, but by saying that while her speech and actions are despicable, it is also true that in America everyone has a right to make a fool of oneself. It is the right of the customers, however, not to patronize such a fool. So far, the fans in Cincinnati and in the National League cities have not seen fit to send that message. But they should be the ultimate judges, not her pious fellow  owners.

During a visit to Los Angeles last week, the boss lady known as Madame Berlioux talked about a potential boycott by the Soviet Union and other Eastern European bloc nations over the NATO plan. She learned of this possibility, she said, from Juan Antonio Samaranch, once the Spanish Ambassador to Moscow and now the I.O.C. president.

First of all, perhaps the reason why no one has seen fit to cosponsor Senator Simpson's bill is because it is not a delicately balanced piece of legislation.   What is wrong with it? A great deal. I don't think it will answer the question of how we can effectively control our borders. In addition, it would still be discriminatory without offering the promise of a complete amnesty.

Can I switch to a policy that also covers home care?         A. For many people in good health, it is not only possible but strongly recommended. The reasons are several: People are living longer and relying more on home care while the Government is threatening to cut back on such aid. So if you are over age 50 with a net worth of at least $250,000, it is time to start shopping around for a policy that includes home care.

Yet there are not many who have been able to combine major scientific work with a clarity of thinking and writing that commands instant attention and provides comprehension outside the ranks of the specialists. The great geneticist J.B.S. Haldane, one of the founders of the ''modern synthesis'' - that heady mix of evolutionary theory and genetics -certainly could. During the 1930's and 40's he wrote a weekly science column in The Daily Worker of London that combined scientific erudition with sharp political comment.

He impersonates Lieutenant Haggerty, supposed to be one of Uncle Sam's flying aces. A crash means little to this Haggerty, for no sooner has he been forced to nosedive to the earth than he asks for another machine. He then soars up and turns the tables on his adversary, who has only a few moments to gloat over his temporary victory.Haggerty is one of those bird-men who need relaxation after a round or so in the skies. He darts over to Paris, where he is a devil with the women and wine. Haggerty's romance is spurred on by the activities of the Military Police. To avoid these zealous men Haggerty takes refuge in an unoccupied room, but soon after he has closed the door in comes a charming brunette, named Germaine, who fortunately for Haggerty has a fluent knowledge of English. At the moment of her entry Haggerty is hiding under the bed, but later he is discovered by Germaine. She sympathizes with him, and while he slumbers in a chair she takes the trouble to mend his tunic. On awakening, Haggerty, who had not quite caught Germaine's name, says:\\"Geranium, you're a daisy.\\"After that Haggerty enjoys himself by chasing Germaine over sunlit, meadows, obviously glad to be away from machine guns in the clouds.Judging by the coincidences that come to pass in this feature the army was like one little family. Haggerty runs into his Major the day after he had set foot in Paris, and he again encounters several others, including the little brunette with the bright eyes and white teeth. Molly O'Day, who shared honors with Richard Barthelmess in \\"The Patent Leather Kid,\\" in this picture portrays Germaine. Miss O'Day does very well. Mr. Sills makes a decidedly energetic attempt to live up to Haggerty's sobriquet, sometimes with a pugnacious grimace with a suggestion of a sneer and on other occasions with an ominous frown.Those who assisted in giving this subject to the screen world are Charles Brabin, the director","excerpt":"Wid Gunning, the producer, Carey Wilson who adapted it from \\"Belated Evidence,\\" a story by Elliott White Springs, and it is distributed by First National.

But at least as important, experts say, is the new order on Wall Street, where the combination of exotic financial markets and instruments, and advanced computer capabilities, has introduced a degree of uncertainty -and volatility - heretofore unknown.   Yesterday, the widely watched Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.17 points on record volume, on the heels of an 86.61-point drop Thursday, bringing the total decline for the week to 141.03 points, or 7.4 percent.
