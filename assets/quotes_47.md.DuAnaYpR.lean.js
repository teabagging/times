Ms. Nichols's footwork was fast and sharp but always delicate, topped by a soft upper torso that was like oil over turbulent water. After a slightly rocky start, Mr. Hubbe relaxed into his distinctive blending of earth and air, traveling across the stage and turning in a way that dug into the floor and sailed above it simultaneously.

An arrangement in the 1970's for exchange rates to fluctuate within a band within another band was called the snake in the tunnel, and the total of the unemployment and inflation percentages was called the misery index. In the 80's an aborted economic recovery was called a dead cat bounce. Even its euphemisms for recession give the users a sensation of seasickness, as in rolling readjustment.   How pleasant it was, in this sad trope-a-dope, to hear an economist introduce a happy figure of speech to the droopy discourse. It happened at a White House briefing this month by Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labor, and Laura Tyson, the Council of Economic Advisers chair. (Ms. Tyson is the chairwoman of the group, and not a piece of furniture, but the official Clinton terminology labels her chair. Although the White House press office, in its releases, uses an o to spell advisors, her council styles itself advisers, the spelling preferred by Merriam-Webster's Collegiate, 10th Edition, and by American Heritage. Advisors -- perhaps influenced by supervisor -- is listed first by Webster's New World Dictionary, Third Edition, giving cover to the White House press office and to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, Anthony Lake, who uses the controversial -or ending in spelling his informal title of National Security Advisor. However, most newspaper stylebooks, including that of The New York Times, use adviser, but who listens to the elitist media and its culture of personal destruction anymore? Amid this babble, a voice of cool authority is needed.  My advice: in this devolutionary political era, don't knuckle under to any White House spelling diktat","excerpt":"spell it adviser.

Filmmakers who shoot at their parents’ homes and produce on credit-card-financed shoestrings create, for the most part, erratic movies, and independent perfumers generally produce erratic collections. There are the political perfumes (“all natural! all organic!”), which tend to smell like bottled ideologies, and theme collections (“Japan!”), and the slightly trite “I hunt the planet for the most fabulous materials.” And if the scents are almost always inferior to the Diors and the Tom Fords, it is due to the fact that perfume is not do-it-yourself. It is an excruciatingly difficult art form that requires trained professionals with access to the materials and technicians. And even then they can bomb. Most niche scent makers do forgettable work. One exception is Dawn Spencer Hurwitz. An independent perfumer in Boulder, Colo., with a house called Parfums des Beaux Arts (why do American perfumers Scotch-tape on French names?), she has produced a collection with a very specific aesthetic. By design or not, she makes scents in the 21st-century manner that was largely pioneered by the perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena’s “big minimalism”: the crafting of intelligent fragrances that melt subtly into skin rather than sitting egotistically on top of it in the grand French manner, that glow quietly instead of shouting about the Champs-Élysées. The first Spencer Hurwitz perfume I smelled several years ago was Pamplemousse (perhaps we could call this Grapefruit and be done with it), and it was excellent. Crisp, luscious, edible, tangy grapefruit, becoming slightly darker as it evolves into a bergamot/bitter-orange aspect, like a shard of glass under halogen with someone very gradually dimming the lights. We simply move from sparkling to hypnotic. Citrus molecules are as light and bouncy as Ping-Pong balls in an earthquake, and they tend to zip away or decompose, but this is a bitter quinine tonic water delight whose diffusion remains surprisingly excellent. Pamplemousse is not a work of complex art like 2 by Comme des Garçons. But it doesn’t need to be. The molecules ping off skin like an astringent breeze, and the effect is transfixing. Spencer Hurwitz has two approaches: straightforward literalist and straightforward abstract. Those in the first category are generally good. Sienna is a literalist cinnamon, very nicely done. She’s taken out just enough food reference to make the cinnamon a wearable perfume, and the sharp spice mellows in 20 minutes to the scent of cool, shadowy hallway. Less successful is Prince, a rather inexplicable drugstore spice marine suited to a masculine deodorant stick. Quinacridone Violet is apricot jam plus Japanese plum wine, and while it suffers a bit from the jammy aspect, it remains interesting","excerpt":"Spencer Hurwitz is experimenting in what she calls “color-into-scent” synesthetic art.

He was preceded in death by his wife, Lea, and is survived by two sons: his son Richard, an architect in York, Pennsylvania; and his son, Robert of Staten Island, New York, and by a granddaughter, Lea.

This is the city the photographer Michael Woods has recorded in recent years in PARIS AND THE SURREALISTS (Thames and Hudson, $35), a Paris more poetic and compelling than dreams, the city that the Surrealists cherished and that remains a Surrealist's paradise. The text by George Melly, the author of \\"Revolt Into Style,\\" skillfully blends his own observations with selective accounts of what Andre Breton, Louis Aragon and others made of Paris; he illuminates the power the city held, and still holds, over the imagination. Paris was the Surrealists' mistress, Mr. Melly writes, and \\"its femininity acted as the ideal Surrealist muse; a role the movement assigned, much to the recent indignation of some women liberationists, to 'Woman' in general. No other city has this quality. Most cities are masculine.\\" And indeed, from stone statues in parks and squares to busts in a wax museum or a flea market, an antique medical corset or even legs dangling in a shop window advertising nylons, Paris still speaks of woman in an infinity of ways, many of which Mr. Woods has captured. But the silence and light of glass-roofed \\n\\npassages\\n\\n, the collective stare of glass eyes in a shop window and the morbid emptiness of the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont hint of other things. Readers whose desire, imagination and curiosity are aroused by such a fine visual and literary introduction to the undying Surrealist city might just want to roam its streets and find \\n\\nl'amour fou.

In an interview last week, G. Gordon Liddy said that thought had occurred to him and other members of the Nixon White House \\"plumbers unit\\" back when Watergate-era revelations in Jack Anderson's column were irritating President Nixon. Mr. Liddy, who was interviewed by Mr. Anderson on the CNBC show \\"The Real Story,\\" said that in a discussion of how to silence the columnist, political operatives working for the Committee to Re-elect the President considered slipping him a dose of LSD, but dropped that idea as too unpredictable. \\"Finally,\\" Mr. Liddy told Mr. Anderson, \\"they came up with striking your car on a turn and making it crash and burn. It was written up in a memo and sent to the White House.\\" But, he added, the White House said that would be wrong. \\"Thus you and I are sitting here chit-chatting, the war being over,\\" Mr. Liddy said. The show's producer said that Mr. Anderson kept his personal feelings about the matter to himself. Headliners","excerpt":"Spin Surgeon"},{"year":"2006","title":"Mail call","excerpt":"spin the bottle.

The doubts are understandable, considering that his images of rocky seascapes, freckled urchins and Adirondack woodsmen have been so thoroughly absorbed into our collective memory, and so degraded by generations of outdoor magazine illustrators, that it is possible to take Homer for granted, if not unconsciously to confuse him with his imitators. To a degree, Homer has become synonymous with a certain quaint, populist, long-gone Americana, and this has caused people to misgauge his achievement.         Quaint he never was, in art or in life. In his later years, he was a loner, the archetypal Yankee salt in his cottage on the Maine coast, though the truth is that Homer was always too diverse and complicated to be slotted into any of the usual categories. This show proves that. Grandly installed, a brilliant distillation of about 180 paintings, drawings and watercolors from the roughly 2,000 works by him that survive, the exhibition is a joy.
