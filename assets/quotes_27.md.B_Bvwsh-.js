These provocative designs could be called the Pop Art of the furniture world.   To see such innovations at High Point, the largest marketplace of wholesale furniture in the country, is startling. Although North Carolina has long been the center of the American furniture industry, its reputation has been based on purely traditional designs.  So the fact that several major American manufacturers are cutting loose is news indeed - news that will be felt when this furniture trickles into stores in the coming months.  The inspiration for these pieces, however, is not American. The look originated in Italy about two years ago with a group of international designers who call themselves Memphis and whose collection has received much attention at the Salone del Mobile Italiano, held each September in Milan. While a few Memphis- style pieces were spotted at High Point last year, the sheer ingenuity of the Italian prototypes has not been felt in the mass market until now.  ''High Point is being quietly revolutionized,'' says Richard Grossman, the chief executive at International Printworks in Needham, Mass.  ''Manufacturers are trying to define good styling, which is what these Italian pieces are all about.''

McKim considered the Harvard Union, the sumptuous Georgian building of 1902 that was his first building on the Harvard campus, to  be an assertion of the democratic spirit in an increasingly elitist university. He saw it as a clublike place for those Harvard men who could not afford to join the private clubs that were increasingly coming to dominate the university's social life. McKim, the celebrated senior partner of McKim, Mead &  White and the architect of such monuments as Pennsylvania Station and the University Club in New York, would doubtless have been puzzled to hear his building described at the end of the century as the ultimate symbol of Harvard's elitism.         But that is just how it has been portrayed in a preservation battle that has  pitted faculty against faculty, alumni against alumni and both groups against the administration, reaching an astonishing level of public rancor for an architectural issue on a college campus, or anywhere else for that matter. The university decided some time ago to turn the Union, which since 1926 had been Harvard's freshman dining hall, into a new academic center to be shared by Harvard's various humanities departments.

Whatever the political expediency and legality of fudging scholarship support for minority students in this manner, to suggest that the finesse of an accountant can shield all Government policy choices ignores, at the least, the constraints of the First Amendment in other contexts.   Now pending in the United States Supreme Court, for example, is a case challenging the Bush Administration's attempt to employ the very shield you support in defense of a gag rule on professional speech. In Rust v. Sullivan (in which I am counsel of record for the petitioners), the Bush Administration seeks to draw a sharp division between Federal and private funds for domestic family planning. It is defending the censorship of abortion information, counseling and referral in Title X-funded family-planning clinics.    But as Anna Quindlen stated in \\"Banning the A-Word\\" (column, Nov. 1), this defense merely spits in the face of the law. Indeed, what she described as the Government's \\"demand that doctors like Irving Rust trade free speech and professional responsibility for scarce Federal funds\\" is not immunized from public condemnation or constitutional scrutiny because Dr. Rust remains theoretically free to give information about abortion to his low-income patients with non-Federal funds, outside the Federal Title X program.   Universities too, like not-for-profit health clinics, have to scramble to pool resources from both governmental and private donors in order to provide critical services and opportunities to economically disadvantaged communities. The razor blade approach to Federal policy reflected by the Administration's \\"compromise\\" on race-based college scholarships and endorsed by your editorial evidences a callous disregard for this reality, as well as for the power of the Government purse. In the free speech context, however, this approach fails completely to save Government censorship from crossing the constitutional line.

The Staten Island college sophomore is the first black American Olympic luger and last month became the first American slider to win a gold medal in any level of international competition when he took first place in the world junior championships in Japan. Though he placed second among 65 competitors in time trials last week, no talk of luge medals in France comes from Mr. Pipkins, whose event ends tomorrow. \\"No,\\" he told a reporter. \\"I'm not going to win a medal here.\\" Instead, he said, he is looking forward to the next Olympics.

On Thursday night, the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players gave this mixture a weightless, sure-footed treatment that was thoroughly fresh, turning melodrama into froth without veering into camp. Their performance was also thoroughly traditional in character, down to the mugging and dancing. The success was due largely to Albert Bergeret's accomplished direction and conducting -- this production is surely one of his company's crispest -- and to the accomplished singing of the cast, most of whom are familiar members of Nygasp (which is the acronym the company prefers).

Members of the staff have been known to take regular fresh-air breaks out in front and to complain of skin rashes, dizziness  and nausea.

Just read, amid the more damning diary entries, the blow-by-blow description of a senatorial hairdo. But where that mastery will leave the real void, now that he's resigning, is on the Senate Finance Committee, which he heads. He somehow understands the intricacies of taxes and Medicare -- and, it is said, can explain it in English (quite a trick!). So while one colleague said, \\"I don't think any senator is indispensable,\\" others said his departure \\"complicates things\\" and leaves a \\"substantial void\\" in areas where the Republicans crave big changes. What now? Bob Dole is expected to run the committee, from offstage, till yearend. STALKING CHRYSLER  This Time, Kerkorian's Serious  When Kirk Kerkorian made noises in the spring about buying Chrysler, people stopped listening after a while, and Mr. Kerkorian seemed to fade into the upholstery. He didn't. He was, apparently, scouting around for an ally who'd be taken seriously, and last week he found one, luring Jerome York, former Chrysler finance chief, away from I.B.M. The markets are taking it very seriously, with Chrysler's stock rising as relentlessly as I.B.M.'s falls. And Chrysler took it seriously -- doubling, to $2 billion, its stock buyback. Mr. York, it is agreed, wants to run Chrysler -- so he probably won't be satisfied with what Chrysler may offer: a board seat.  CUBA  Island of Capitalism  The official line, still: Cuba is an evil Communist empire, a lurking threat to the very barbecues and bowling leagues of democracy. But each day that image meanders further from reality, as Fidel Castro's once-defiant island looks more and more like a bastion of capitalism -- lacking only American capitalists. Last week Cuba passed a law allowing foreign investment in anything but defense, health care and education. To be sure, the door could have been opened wider -- the Government must give its nod case by case, and \\"anything that doesn't benefit\\" Cuba's development \\"will be excluded.\\" Still, some American businesses -- which would love to get a foot in this fast-revolving door -- saw a golden opportunity to rethink our trade ban.  AUTOS  Trucks in Cars' Clothing  They're priced like luxury cars. They're filled with luxury-car goodies, like CD players, phone outlets and serious leather. But Jeeps, Explorers and Suburbans drink gas like trucks. How do they get away with it? Because they're \\"light\\" trucks, ruled by much looser mileage standards. This is no small matter, for of every 10 new passenger vehicles sold, 4 are light trucks, and this surging popularity has slammed into reverse the nation's solid gains in fuel efficiency. \\"Outrageous,\\" said a Sierra Club official. \\"Ridiculous,\\" said Automotive News. Indeed, the Administration might raise mileage standards for trucks -- fiercely opposed by auto makers, of course, and the regulation-busting House.  JAPAN  Few Jobless, but Few Jobs  In the United States, by the strange math of economists, 6 percent unemployment is often considered \\"full employment.\\" So Japan, with an official jobless rate of 3.2 percent, would seem a job-seeker's paradise. Far from it. On Monday, as most Americans basked in a Labor Day untainted by labor, more than 12,000 Japanese college students flocked from across the nation to a Tokyo stadium for what was essentially a huge job fair. With Japan stuck in recession, top companies were not exactly clamoring for their talents. Top seniors competed for jobs as clerks and construction workers, others competed for any job at all -- and women were left with the scraps. It was the dark side of lifetime employment -- don't hire in the first place.  CHARITIES  Rewarded Before Heaven  The men and women who head the nation's nonprofit organizations naturally do so out of dedication to good works, but starvation wages are not usually part of the deal. Even after the president of United Way was sent packing after he lived it up on the charity's money -- a scandal that snapped the public to attention -- salaries are rising steadily. And a survey out last week found that the top salaries, by far, went to the heads of big city hospitals: Mount Sinai, $900,000","excerpt":"Sloan-Kettering, nearly $800,000. The Salvation Army's president, though, made just $58,000, while the president of Philip Morris made nearly $2 million. And Newt Gingrich? $133,600 (without royalties). EDUCATION  Mr. Moon Goes to School  Is a university just another business? After all, if it can't pay its bills, it'll be as bankrupt as a failed dry cleaner. So can anyone with ready cash simply \\"buy\\" this \\"business\\" and do with it what he will? That was the extra-credit question last week as the University of Bridgeport bestowed an honorary degree on the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, who saved the school from bankruptcy by giving it $98 million since 1992. Enrollment has risen from 1,100 to 1,800, but the \\"Moonies\\" have not \\"taken over,\\" said the president -- a 20-year friend of Mr. Moon's. \\"This is a normal American university with a unique funding source.\\" Critics, though, say Mr. Moon's followers have lured foreign students with big scholarships -- with church training part of the deal.  PUBLISHING  A Magazine, by George!  Government-bashers will love this one: a model as President. Even those irreverent souls who said Ronald Reagan was merely acting the part wouldn't have had such a wildly cynical fantasy. But there she is: Cindy Crawford as a seductive George Washington on the cover -- unveiled last week -- of an odd new magazine called, yes, George. This isn't just any magazine, though. It's \\"post-partisan,\\" whatever that means. It's the MTV of politics. It's full of Georges, of all stripes: Wallace, Stephanopoulos, Bush (well, Barbara anyway). Oh, and by the way, a fellow named Kennedy edits it (no, not George: that's the actor; this is confusing enough!). This one, if memory serves, is related to some former President.

With Mr. Reagan's dominance of the political scene approaching an end and the conservative agenda seemingly stalled, both parties appear to be groping their way toward the political center on the assumption that this will be the crucial ground on which the campaign battles of 1986 and beyond will be waged.   The Democratic left and the Republican right, of course, are not particularly happy with this movement, and both can be expected to try to reverse it in the 1988 Presidential election. The Republican right is especially frustrated these days, which may explain why some of its leaders recently lashed out at one of their own, Representative Jack F.

He asked that the measure, which would have given him authority to negotiate trade agreements that Congress could accept or reject but not alter, be shelved. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said the legislation's chances of being passed next year, when members of Congress are seeking re-election, were even more remote. Clinton's defeat was a victory for organized labor, which saw American jobs threatened, but many business executives warned that it would prove costly to the nation's economy.    THE ECONOMY  Sales Off","excerpt":"Slowdown Ahead?  Autumn struck the economy in October, chilling it so much that some economists worried that an economic slowdown was taking hold just before the holiday shopping season. Shoppers spent a seasonally adjusted $213.7 billion last month, down 0.2 percent, the second consecutive monthly drop in retail sales, the Commerce Department reported. The Labor Department said prices paid to producers like food processing plants and factories inched 0.1 percent higher in October, meaning that the Producer Price Index has declined at a 1.2 percent annual rate during the first 10 months of the year. The productivity of American workers grew at an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the third quarter, the fastest pace in five years, easing fears that labor shortages could lead to renewed inflation.    MARKETS  Who's Exuberant Now?  Alan Greenspan, the Fed chief often quoted as warning against irrational exuberance in the financial markets, sounded quite a different note last week. With the markets gyrating wildly, he became soothing, saying that problems in Asia and elsewhere should not threaten prosperity in the United States or the soundness of the nation's financial system. The Fed voted on Wednesday not to raise interest rates, concerned that tightening monetary policy would further destabilize global markets and betting that the American economy might slow sufficiently to avert any inflationary threat. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 7,572.48, down 8.84 points, while the Nasdaq composite was down 18.59, to 1,581.51    BRITAIN, THE BRAND  Embracing All Things Modern  To compete in the modern world, Britain is being ''rebranded,'' Tony Blair's spin doctors recommend in a study, as ''one of the world's pioneers rather than one of its museums.'' Out are scenes of village cricket, tea and scones. In are images of pulsing telecommunications, global business transactions, bold architecture, cheeky advertising and daring fashion. Even Britain's venerable red telephone boxes are being replaced by transparent glass booths. While the Labor Party goes mod, Tories say they still prefer ''Rule, Britannia'' to ''Cool Britannia.''    PEOPLE  Cash for Katzenberg  The Walt Disney Company settled with Jeffrey Katzenberg, its former studio chief, who had sued for at least $250 million. He contended that Disney owed him a share of the profits from hit films like ''Beauty and the Beast'' and ''The Lion King.'' What he will receive is still to be decided. . . . Warren Flick, Kmart's president and chief operating officer, who is given much credit for reviving the retailer's sagging fortunes, will retire after only two years at the company, for health reasons. . . . Mildred Robbins Leet and Glenn Leet, a Manhattan couple, have fought an 18-year battle against poverty. Since founding the Trickle Up Program, a nonprofit organization that gives modest amounts of seed money for new businesses, they have helped 65,000 entrepreneurs, mostly women like Maria Miranda, a millener in Jackson Heights, Queens, below, to start small businesses.    INTERNATIONAL  A Delay in Russian Bonds  Gazprom, the Russian monopoly involved in a natural-gas project in Iran, postponed a $3 billion bond offering for which Goldman, Sachs is the lead underwriter. . . . ING Groep, the expansionist-minded Dutch financial services company, is seeking to buy Banque Bruxelles Lambert of Belgium for $4.68 billion in cash and securities.    LAYOFFS  Kodak to Cut 10,000 Jobs  Eastman Kodak, struggling to compete with Fuji of Japan in film sales, said it would cut 10,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force. It hopes to save $1 billion in the next two years. It was the biggest layoff announcement by any American company this year and comes on top of some 40,000 Kodak job cuts since 1983. . . . Fruit of the Loom will cut 2,900 jobs, or 17 percent of its American work force. The cuts will effectively complete the company's drive to move its sewing operations to Mexico, the Caribbean and other offshore sites with cheaper labor. . . . Waste Management, responding to pressure from dissident shareholders, announced a broad reorganization that will eliminate 20 percent of its corporate and support staff and save $100 million annually.    AUTOMOBILES  G.M. Taking a Hit  General Motors said it would take a charge against earnings of $2 billion to $3 billion to pay for job cuts, write-downs in the value of some factories and other changes intended to streamline the company in the long term. It did not disclose details, but the bulk of the job cuts are expected to come in Europe. And G.M. lost a bid to manufacture passenger cars at a plant in southern China. The winner, Honda, will produce a model resembling its Accord at the plant, which was vacated by the French auto maker PSA Peugeot Citroen. . . .In a rare admission of a serious engineering error, Daimler-Benz halted shipments of its Mercedes A-Class subcompact, which is to be sold in Europe, while it refits the chassis to prevent the car from flipping during high-speed turns.     DEALS  Dial MCI for Money  Money talks. In what would be America's biggest merger ever, MCI Communications, the nation's No. 2 long-distance telephone company, agreed to be acquired by Worldcom, an industry upstart, for $36.5 billion in cash and stock. Worldcom triumphed over GTE, which offered $28 billion, and British Telecommunications, which bid $19 billion. . . . Shareholders of ITT, the once-sprawling conglomerate that has shrunk under the leadership of Rand V. Araskog, left, into what is now primarily a hotel and casino company, endorsed a $10.2 billion cash-and-stock sale to Starwood Lodging Trust, rejecting a $9.3 billion hostile takeover offer from Hilton Hotels.

Slowly, he raises his surgically scarred left knee","excerpt":"slowly he lets it down. Up, down. Up, down. His left thigh is wrapped in a muscle stimulator. His left ankle is wrapped with five pounds of lead weights. And his baseball future is wrapped in uncertainty.   \\"But I'm here,\\" he was saying recently. \\"I'm lucky the knee is all that happened. I could've been paralyzed.\\"   He could've been killed. While driving his snowmobile on New Year's Eve outside his home in Baker, Ore., he didn't realize he was near a barbed-wire fence hidden under a snowbank.   \\"I got my property line mixed up,\\" he said. \\"In the crash, I tore two ligaments in my knee.\\"   Carney Lansford's knee damage is not as career-threatening as Bo Jackson's hip ailment. Doctors have predicted that Lansford might return to third base as early as September.   But he acknowledged that his injury has been described as exactly the same as that of Bernard King, the Washington Bullets' forward who had knee-reconstruction surgery in 1985.   \\"And Bernard's doing all right,\\" Lansford said.   King, however, missed virtually two seasons with the Knicks, then was traded to the Bullets two months before his 31st birthday.   Lansford is 34 now, coming off a disappointing .268 season with only 3 homers and 50 runs batted in, well below his .336 in 1989 that matched his 1981 batting-title average for the Boston Red Sox.   Until the snowmobile accident, Lansford was one of the pillars of Oakland's pennant-winning teams, as quietly dependable as Jose Canseco and Rickey Henderson were noisily impetuous.   Maybe that's why the Athletics' front office hasn't questioned the payment of Lansford's $1.15 million salary in this final season of his four-year, $5.25 million contract.   According to Lansford, \\"It's written that it's O.K. for me to snowmobile,\\" but Sandy Alderson, the A's vice president, disagreed.   \\"Carney's contract doesn't say he can snowmobile and it doesn't say he can't,\\" Alderson said. \\"It's a fuzzy situation. We decided not to pursue it.\\"   Instead, the A's welcomed Lansford's plan to do his knee rehabilitation at their spring training site in Phoenix, to be in the clubhouse and on the bench when the season starts, including the road trips.   \\"I'll do what I can,\\" Lansford said, \\"to keep the guys loose and keep 'em going.\\"   Soon after Lansford's accident, the A's signed Vance Law, a longtime National League third baseman who batted .313 with 29 homers for the Chunichi Dragons in Japan last year. Ernest Riles, a utility infielder acquired earlier from the San Francisco Giants, might also play third base when a left-handed batter is needed.   \\"If they need help on where to play the hitters, I'll be there,\\" Lansford said, \\"but Vance is a veteran player.\\"   Vance Law has not been Carney Lansford, whose absence could undermine the A's ambition to emerge as the first team since the 1960-64 Yankees to qualify for four consecutive World Series, then to atone for their 4-0 embarrassment by the Cincinnati Reds last year.   In addition to his clutch hits, Lansford has led American League third basemen in fielding in four of the last five seasons and batting second half the time last season, he was willing to take pitches whenever Henderson decided to steal second.   In his rehabilitation, Lansford isn't expected to be allowed to run or even swing a bat until mid-May.   \\"That'll be four months after the operation,\\" he said. \\"Until then, I do these leg lifts. I exercise with a bunch of different machines and I ride a bike for 20 minutes.\\"   That's a stationary bike, not a motorcycle.   \\"I don't like motorcycles,\\" he said, \\"but you can go just as fast on a snowmobile: 80, 90 miles an hour, no switching gears. I've been riding snowmobiles ever since I moved my wife and kids up to the northeast corner of Oregon, not far from the Idaho border. I had a few minor spills in a snowmobile when I hit a rock, but I've never driven a snowmobile in competition. You can kill yourself doing that.\\"   Luckily, he tore up only his knee.   But whenever athletes bust themselves up, it's often in a bizzare accident. Bob Ojeda, then with the Mets, sliced off the tip of a finger on his pitching hand with an electric hedge-clipper.   Curt Simmons, then a Phillies left-hander, once cut off a toe with an electric lawnmower. And Jim Lonborg, then a Red Sox right-hander, tore up a knee in a skiing accident.   \\"We're professional athletes; we're active guys,\\" Carney Lansford said. \\"You can't expect us to become a couch potato.\\" Lansford's Snowmobile Scare"},{"year":"1931","title":"J Klein says thought of stabilization is dangerous PAY CUTS LENGTHEN SLUMP, KLEIN WARNS","excerpt":"Slowly Increasing Confidence of Buyers Must Not Be Impaired, He Says Here.

Think, alas, of forecasts of rain and soggy sighs of disappointment.   Indeed, Monday night's concert came dangerously close to being washed out.

You    go first.\\" The two conductors continued arguing over their loudspeakers. Eventually the second one won. \\"You leave right now!\\" he commanded triumphantly.   We rushed back into the first train, returning to our reading, dozing, staring. Once it began moving, I noticed that we had all come back to the same spots we had had: the heavyset fellow standing near the door, the woman sitting beside me.

His William Keane looks all-American, too, with his short, side-parted hair and casual preppy clothes. But he's a young, divorced father living on disability who, driven by guilt and grief, prowls the Port Authority bus terminal where his 6-year-old daughter disappeared months earlier while his mind was elsewhere.

As a result, many small and medium-sized companies that would never have given much thought to such perils have begun buying kidnapping and ransom insurance just within the last year.   \\"One reason is that terror tactics have gotten a lot of publicity in recent years,\\" said Kenneth Stephens, the crime, kidnapping and ransom product manager of Chubb & Son Inc., part of the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies. \\"In addition, many smaller companies are branching out overseas, setting up offices and plants or thinking about doing so, therefore in some of those countries their employees are now at risk.\\" Business Travel","excerpt":"Small and medium-size companies are beginning to buy kidnapping and ransom insurance."},{"year":"1995","title":"Just as a new battle for the heart of the desktop computer has begun, Louis V. Gerstner, the chief executive of I.B.M., appeared to concede defeat yesterday.   In his annual session with analysts, Mr. Gerstner admitted what many industry watchers have been saying for years: that I.B.M. has failed in its multibillion-dollar attempt to establish an alternative to the Microsoft Corporation's stranglehold on the software that runs personal computers.   Obsessing about operating systems is \\"fighting the last war,\\" he told the group, later adding that it is \\"too late to go after the desktop.\\"   \\"We have to go on to the next thing,\\" he said.   Mr. Gerstner's comments came only three weeks before Microsoft is to introduce Windows 95, the successor to the Windows and MS-DOS programs that now control about 80 percent of all personal computers. Most analysts believe that the new program will gain wide acceptance, cementing Microsoft's primacy in a market that it has dominated since 1980, when I.B.M. licensed MS-DOS for its first personal computer.    I.B.M. has since tried to challenge Microsoft with a program called OS/2. Although many analysts say OS/2 is technologically superior to both the current version of Windows and the soon-to-be-released Windows 95, it has never caught on with more than a small minority of consumers.    Some I.B.M. executives have argued that the introduction of Windows 95 will help OS/2 because consumers will be forced to make a change and will see the benefits of I.B.M.'s offering. But others within the company have countered that it would be futile and a waste of money to go head to head against Microsoft where it is strongest.    Yesterday, for the first time, Mr. Gerstner appeared to side with those pragmatists. He said I.B.M. would aggressively sell OS/2 to large companies and institutions that use it on application servers, which allow networks of desktop computers to share a variety of computer programs.    \\"Our focus is in the large enterprise,\\" he said.   OS/2 has dominated the market for such servers in recent years, but many analysts said the company was quickly losing ground to another Microsoft program, Windows NT.    \\"NT is displacing OS/2 servers extremely rapidly,\\" said Rob Enderle, a senior research analyst at Dataquest, an industry consultant based in San Jose, Calif. He estimated that I.B.M. had more than a 2-to-1 advantage at the beginning of the year in the number of servers running OS/2 compared with NT, but that Microsoft had probably pulled even and was likely to overtake I.B.M. by the end of the year.    I.B.M. still has a chance, Mr. Enderle said, \\"but it is narrowing fast.\\"   \\"A lot of premier I.B.M. accounts have indicated that they will be pulling off OS/2 in the next 12 to 18 months,\\" he added.    During his 90-minute session with analysts, Mr. Gerstner expanded on a theme that he has been warming to since he arrived at I.B.M. two years ago: that I.B.M. is now focused on providing value to its customers rather than simply foisting the latest technology on them.    He said that the company had identified five groups of customers that it would now try to serve: large enterprises and institutions","excerpt":"small and medium-sized businesses; consumers; other hardware manufacturers, and resellers and other distributors.    Asked if I.B.M.'s recent $3.5 billion acquisition of the Lotus Development Corporation was an admission that the company had failed to plan properly for its future, Mr. Gerstner admitted that it was. \\"It is an indictment of things we did wrong in the past and I am glad that we had the opportunity to fix it,\\" he said.   But he added that he and his management team now spend a lot of time thinking ahead. \\"There is a very strong preoccupation in the company today to understand where the industry is going and get there first,\\" he said.

BARBARA CROSSETTE is deputy foreign editor of The New York Times.  There are ways, usually expensive, to avoid regimented resort life, like chartering a yacht to island hop or flying off on one's own to the bigger islands, looking for destinations or hotels not on the package circuit. Over the years we've tried freelancing our way around a number of larger islands, with mixed success. Cuba was off limits, and Trinidad (even with Tobago thrown in) was mostly a scruffy disappointment. Puerto Rico would have been fine, if muggers hadn't been stalking some of the loveliest secluded spots. Haiti was fascinating, if sad. And Jamaica - well, Jamaica had British cooking and a mood, people said, that was inhospitable. We never really gave it a chance.  Early in December, a writing assignment provided an excuse to travel the length and breadth of Jamaica, and the island turned out to be a happy surprise. Jamaica, the Caribbean's third-largest island (144 miles long and more than 50 miles wide), has a variety of terrain: savannas and marshlands","excerpt":"small coves and long, empty beaches; rivers and waterfalls, and some of the highest (7,400 feet) and coolest mountains of any island.
