NBC is going with soapy melodrama in \\"Grass Roots,\\" a four-hour movie being shown at 9 P.M. today and tomorrow. This evening at 9 ABC goes for the disaster market in \\"Crash Landing: The Rescue of Flight 232.\\" If CBS's \\"Murphy Brown\\" thinks a bit of worrying might be in order, forget it.    Spinning off a 1983 mini-series titled \\"Chiefs\\" and also adapted from a Stuart Woods novel, \\"Grass Roots\\" continues the story of the Lee family of Georgia through the earnest but rather dim character of Will Lee, played by Corbin Bernsen (\\"L.A. Law\\"), who seems to be becoming a specialist in dimness. When Will's boss, one of Washington's most powerful senators, has a stroke, the ambitious lawyer decides to run for the seat, even though he is embroiled in a sticky court case defending a white man (James Wilder) accused of raping and killing a black woman. Complicating matters further, Will is having a secret affair with Kate Rule (Mel Harris), who works for the Central Intelligence Agency.

The objections to the aid, however, carry the same force, whether or not the operations are kept secret. \\n\\nLast year, the details of a few incidents in the covert war became widely known. They confirmed the suspicion that we had allied ourselves with terrorists, and the result was a suspension of Central Intelligence Agency funds for the contras. One suggestion of a new policy has come from Senator David F. Durenberger, the new chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, who proposes open funding to an ''umbrella group'' composed of all the major contra factions.  Since covert aid was front-page news all along, the shift to overt aid would be merely a nominal change. ''The only difference,'' Senator Durenberger has acknowledged, ''is that when we do it covertly, we lie a lot.'' Thus, a shift to open support would not affect the general arguments against our contra policy.  First, the contras aim to destroy the very possibility of civil society in Nicaragua. As the C.I.A.'s contra instruction manual showed, we have been ready to associate ourselves with this aim. The pamphlet spoke of kidnapping, assassination and the hiring of known criminals. But these things were being done before the manual was written, and they continue to be done. A successful day in the life of a contra may include blowing up a warehouse containing oil, grain and other necessities of village life","excerpt":"ambushing a militia unit of teen- aged volunteers; poisoning a farm or two, especially if it produces coffee, on which the country depends for its trade; and perhaps capturing a local ''unsympathetic'' (that is, patriotic) official, to be murdered later as an example to others.
