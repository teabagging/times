The robes are superbly hung on a Tinker-Toy-like framework designed by Cleo Nichols. All that is missing is seeing how the symbolism of each coat came alive when it was worn. For it was the Manchu belief that the human body became the axis of the world, and the wearer s head the apex of the uni verse. The bottom edge of the garment is invariably stitched with a rainbow of stripes or swirls depicting the ocean. Surprisingly, these splendid borders were all anyone saw of the richly orna mented robe worn at court. Surcoats -- dark, unbelted garments bearing the pictorial insignia of rank-became re quired attire in 1759, and these coats covered most of the ravishing robes fa vored by royalty and their followers.  The show at Asia House includes ap proximately 25 garments, dating from the 18th century through about 1905. Glorious court robes dominate, in dy namic and subdued colors, emblazoned with dragons, flowers, ocean waves, mountains and rippling clouds. Most of these are 19th century, and more than a few are imperial. At least six reveal the taste of the Dowager Empress Tzuhsi, who favored bold turquoise and violet. These ravishing robes, which include an emperor s yellow coat dating to the turn of the 19th century, were selected by John Vollmer, associate curator in charge of the textile department at the Royal Ontario Museum, in order to ex plain the origins of both the construc tion of these garments and the tradi tional colors and motifs dramatizing their surfaces.

It is not among the ten best of the year, to be sure, but it likely doesn't aim quite so high as that. The acting on the whole is good and the situations are carried out amiably. Occasionally the theme lapses into slapstick and at others the big rainstorm and drama expert has been called in with almost dire results.Babe Stewart, our leading man, finds himself in the early thirties as a gambler. He has a girl named Kay, and an apartment to which the young lady lures elderly males out for a good time. Kay and the esteemed Babe quarrel, however, and the former—in the language of the force—turns in her partner. He heads for the great open spaces and in a small town meets Mary Randall, a high school student.Presently they are married, and the indictment against Babe having been tossed aside, the couple go to New York. The gambler gives up his trade and goes to work, his wife stays home and answers the door bell. But Kay does not forgive, and, in fact, goes to the District Attorney with the information that Babe is back in town. The law dusts off the indictment and sends the reformed gentleman up the river. He does not tell his wife, leading her to think that he is merely on a business trip to Buenos Aires.Some time later Mary discovers that her husband is in jail and sets out to see him, meeting the wretched Kay at the prison gates. She then returns home through a rainstorm, weeping, to conceal the disaster from her parents. Babe presently gets a pardon and comes back from \\"Buenos Aires,\\" confesses and then is forgiven, because Mary all this time has been knitting minute and spectral clothes.Except for one or two spots the play is well done, having a happy-go-lucky manner at times quite charming. Incidents of apartment life—the ice man and the \\"college guy\\" selling magazine subscriptions—are worked in with ability. Mr. Lowe, as Babe, carries of his part well with the manner of Mr. Menjou and Miss Moore, as Mary, gives a good interpretation of the high school student in a small town turned wife in New York.

Only those too old or infirm to take part are excused, Mr. Getman said. \\n\\nThis fall about 275 veterans are enrolled in a wide variety of programs, including classes leading to certification for food service workers, security guards and nursing assistants","excerpt":"college courses in math, business law, counseling and psychology; computer workshops; apprenticeships in vocational trades, and more than half a dozen courses on topics ranging from U.F.O.'s to legal issues to chair caning.\\n\\nInstructors are provided by Greater Hartford Community College and the town of Rocky Hill. The college's director of business and industry services, Linda Guzzo, designed several of the certification programs to address veterans' needs and interests.\\n\\nThe veterans education center, which has grown to include a small library and five classrooms carved out of unused dormitory space, costs the state $100,000 a year, a fraction of the $27.8 million budgeted this year to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. The department operates several offices around the state in addition to the Rocky Hill home and hospital. The home and hospital, which moved to its present location in Rocky Hill in 1940, was founded in 1864 in Darien as a home for widows and orphans of Civil War soldiers.\\n\\nThe state Commissioner of Veterans Affairs, Hamilton D. Harper Jr., said educating veterans would save money in the long run.\\n\\n\\"If you take that little bit of money and turn a life around and get that veteran out of here, that veteran is going back into society and he's going to contribute and pay taxes,\\" Mr. Harper said.\\n\\nWhile Mr. Getman and Mr. Harper emphasize that the education program is still in its infancy, the initial results have been encouraging. Since February, 15 veterans have moved out of the barracks-style dormitories to private bedrooms in another campus building after landing full-time jobs or enrolling in colleges outside the red-brick complex.\\n\\nFour men have since left the home to get on with their lives, while a few suffered relapses and were returned to the dormitories, where rules prevail, Mr. Getman said. Typically, about 10 percent of those enrolled in courses do not finish them, he said.\\n\\nIn December 1989, fewer than 10 percent of the residents had served during the Vietnam War. Veterans of both world wars and the Korean War filled the home, going there late in life and being buried on the grounds. \\n\\nBut that winter, Mr. Getman said, he began reading news accounts about thousands of homeless Vietnam veterans. He organized teams of hospital employees and traveled with them to homeless shelters looking for veterans who might be interested in going to Rocky Hill. Today, Vietnam veterans account for more than 40 percent of the home's residents. \\nA Case History\\n\\n One of those who became employable as a result of the new program is Kevin McCormick, was two years ago was a patient in the Federal Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Haven, suffering from emotional and mental problems.\\n\\n\\"I was having a very hard time,\\" the 41-year-old veteran recalled recently.\\n\\nHe transferred to Rocky Hill, a move he calls \\"the best thing I ever did,\\" and enrolled in the first nursing assistant program. Mr. McCormick graduated last December and was hired in April at the medical center where he was once a patient.\\n\\nDespite the swing shifts and the commute from Rocky Hill to West Haven, he likes the job. \\"I feel for people,\\" Mr. McCormick said. \\"I get along better with the patients than I do with the employees.\\"\\n\\nMr. McCormick still lives at the veterans home, in a private room, while he searches for a small apartment in the Rocky Hill area. He thinks about leaving the home, a step that is both exciting and frightening.\\n\\n\\"I get scared,\\" he said, but \\"I do want to get out.\\" He worries about paying bills and coping with unexpected expenses on his low salary. At the home, he does not pay rent or the costs of food or utilities. Recently his car broke down, and repairs cost $1,100. When he is on his own, such a surprise could wreak havoc with his tight budget.\\n\\n\\"Motivating people to leave is our biggest challenge right now,\\" Mr. Getman admitted. Within the next six months he hopes to convert a former staff residence into alternative living quarters where people like Mr. McCormick would pay rent, cook their meals and mow the lawn, in preparation for living on their own.\\nJob Fairs for Residents\\n\\n In June, Ed Mills Jr. completed a 10-week course that taught him to be an entry-level security guard. Mr. Mills, who is 46, has applied for four jobs since graduation, but has not been hired. So he is taking the course over again at night.\\n\\n\\"I don't want to get stale,\\" Mr. Mills said.\\n\\nWhile he continues his job search, he works 35 hours a week in the cemetary at the home. He is paid the minimum wage.\\n\\nMr. Getman said he sponsors two job fairs at the veterans home each year, but in a depressed economy that is not enough to help everyone land a job. He and James McKinnon, another member of the veterans home staff, have tried to act as part-time caseworkers while juggling their administrative duties. Now that more residents are seeking jobs, Mr. Getman said he wanted to hire two full-time vocational rehabilitation counselors to work more closely with them.\\n\\nMr. Harper is considering asking veterans organizations for help.\\n\\n\\"If you've got a bunch of people on the outside looking to help you find a job, your chances are enhanced,\\" he said.\\n\\nInstructors at the home report that the veterans are able and engaging students.\\n\\nRobert DeZinno teaches food service sanitation as part of a yearlong certificate course. \\"It's not just that they're being fed material,\\" he said, \\"but they're listening, they're insisting on complete answers, they're contributing. They're a very interesting bunch of guys.\\"\\n\\nEducation has given some veterans the chance to dream of a fresh start. Asked to describe his ideal job, Mr. Mills, the unemployed security guard, hesitated only a few seconds.  He would like to work at a state park and live on the grounds.\\n\\n\\"That would be great,\\" he said.

The sport has been popular at the gate and on television, thereby generating constantly increasing revenues, which in large part have supported the majority of all other intercollegiate sports. For the vast majority of National Collegiate Athletic Association members, this success has been made possible by football television controls that the members have imposed upon themselves during the last 30 years. That success and the continuation of football as a college activity engaged in by students is threatened by the recent decision of the United States District Court in University of Oklahoma and University of Georgia v. N.C.A.A..\\n\\nThe court held that the N.C.A.A.'s football television controls or regulations constituted violations of the antitrust laws, and the court immediately and totally invalidated all such controls and entered an injunction that would render it impossible for the N.C.A.A. even to attempt any alternative plans for football television that might conform with antitrust laws. The court's decision and judgement replaced an organized and carefully administered system of controls with an unfettered license for the colleges to televise games anywhere anytime. Uncontrolled license amounts to anarchy, and this is what will result in the televising of college football unless some authority to avoid it is found or restored.

One thing is certain though: virtually none of the instant ''analysts'' in the press and certainly on television have bothered to read in any detail Judge Burciaga's 98-page opinion.

This offering is a pot-pourri of suspense, maudlin sentiment and quasi-comedy. The principal character, Tom Brown, is not a particularly ingratiating character, inasmuch as he is far too impudent and self-assertive to make up for his athletic prowess and his mild interest in a room-mate he calls a \\"half-pint.\\"Shortly after the preliminary glimpses there are some interesting scenes of Harvard University, to which Brown has been sent by his loving parents. When it comes to admiration for young women, Brown believes in being impulsive, and when he has been in Cambridge for only an hour he is depicted leaning on an automobile chatting to a professor's daughter. Although she offers him no encouragement, he insists on carrying out his usual program by kissing her the second time he sees her. She resents this and Brown, instead of being sorry, looks at the girl with mild astonishment. He eventually discovers that this Mary Abbott is interested in Bob McAndrews, a student to whom Brown took an instant dislike.It is a toss-up for a time whether McAndrews or Brown shall stroke the freshman crew, and when McAndrews hurts his hand Brown has his cherished opportunity. On the night before the race, however, when he thought McAndrews was going to stroke the crew, he drowned his disappointment with alcoholic stimulants, with the result that when he is put into the boat he loses the race through being out of condition.During another period Brown believes that he is not to play on the football team and he goes away. Jim Doolittle, the \\"half-pint,\\" hears that the coach wants Brown to play, and he gets out of a bed when he has a fever and, in the inevitable deluge of rain, after riding on the outside of the train for mile after mile, he eventually tells Brown to report to the coach. Jim goes to the hospital while the game is on. After hurting his ankle, Brown captures the honors of the game, but learns later that his little pal has died.The football scenes and those of the boat race are actual ones of such athletic contests. They fit in nicely in this narrative. William Gaines is fairly proficient as an actor, but he is too much given to smirking in the rôle of Brown, and is almost funny in his emotional moments. Jack Pickford is hardly convincing as the \\"half-pint,\\" especially when he knocks out Brown, when the latter is inebriated. Mary Brian is attractive as Mary Abbot, the girl who eventually falls in love with Brown.

The sculptor runs a brilliant lap and then makes way for the greatest of all champions -- Leonardo, Raphael and, finally, Michelangelo, who breaks the tape at the Sistine Chapel, for the greater glory of central Italy.
