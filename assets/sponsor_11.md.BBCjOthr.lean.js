While the food was always wholesome, dishes were treated to heavy applications of butter and cream. Entrees proved generous to a fault: food, deep in pools of thick sauce, overburdened the plates.

The result is a dreary, fizzled waste of the talents of Marcello Mastroianni and, for all one knows (she does not have many lines), Catherine Spaak.Mastroianni plays a Milanese candy manufacturer who brings home some balloons to Miss Spaak (as his girl) and a grand, somewhat crossbred St. Bernard (as his dog). In the course of the film, the couple and a few other members of the cast are called upon to blow up a truly despair-inducing number of balloons, representing I think, serially, youth, suspense, pregnancy, hope, potency, ambition, breasts, dreams, the Bomb, etc. (The camera, by incessant repetition, lets us know that it has symbols on its mind.)The nominal plot is that Mastroianni becomes obsessed with finding out precisely how much air balloons can hold, that he neglects his girl, goes mad, commits suicide. The parodistic side is that there are sequences nominally mocking other films—a steambath scene, after \\"8½\\"","excerpt":"color-keyed anxiety scenes, after \\"Red Desert\\"; a poet-philosopher guru, after \\"Dolce Vita\\"; puppy play with girls, after \\"Blow-up.\\" They were meant to be self-evidently funny, just because they were there.The outright satiric side shows all kinds of props from modern life—boots for girls, synthetic fabrics, cars, chewing gum, neon, take-out food, discothèques, the balloons themselves—meant to be read self evidently as angry kidding, too, because they are there. Then, there is a lot of nervous, fetishistic play between Mastroianni, Miss Spaak, the food, the boots, and the balloons—included because it amuses the filmmakers.The rhythm of the film, the way it is cut and put together, is altogether skittish and out of phose—so that it is very hard even to pay attention to what is going on. The voices and lip movements—as in so many films these days—are out of synchronization, but in this case so drastically that one is, relieved to look at the subtitles (the film is in Italian) rather than at the speaker's face.There is one very elegant satisfying scene in which Mastroianni slaughters a roomful of balloons. The film, which is partly in color and partly in black and white, opened yesterday at the Beekman.On the same program, there is an interminable, dreary short called ''Railroaded\\" Screen: The Balloon Man:Mastroianni Is Starred With Miss Spaak"},{"year":"1935","title":"Death A.

A challenge to the law is still expected to go to trial in district court in Denver in October. But even if Amendment 2 survives that court test, last week's ruling signaled that the State Supreme Court would likely strike the law down. The court said that lawyers for the state must demonstrate that Colorado has a \\"compelling interest\\" that outweighs Amendment 2's constitutional problems.

For more than 55 years, he gave selflessly to the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and its people, building a body of gemological knowledge personally and deliberately, gemstone by gemstone. Considered the father of modern gemological research in spectrometry, he was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1919 and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from San Diego State University in 1942. He served as a navigator in the Navy during World War II from 1942-45, and during his tour of duty in the Pacific broadened his knowledge of gems and their sources in foreign markets. Upon his discharge, he attended GIA in Los Angeles where he earned a Graduate Gemologist diploma and in 1948 the Fellowship with Distinction Award from the Gemmological Association of Great Britain. In 1949, employed by GIA, he came to Manhattan to establish a laboratory dedicated to the grading and identification of diamonds and gemstones. He served as the GIA Laboratory director from 1952 to 1977, then as its vice president from 1977 to the present. During his 55 year career, he examined tens of thousands of gemstones and was responsible for many significant contributions to the study of gems which today allow gemologists to detect treated and synthetic gem materials. These include advances in the understanding and identification of treated and synthetic diamonds","excerpt":"colored stones such as tanzanite, tsavorite, and amethyst, and untreated and treated natural and cultured pearls. In the early 1950s he contributed to the development of the GIA Diamond Grading System, a standard now used worldwide to assess the quality of polished diamonds. He also demonstrated the value of using gemological equipment developed for other disciplines, such as the prism spectroscope, in gem testing. He shared his practical experience in lectures, presentations, and in numerous articles published by the scholarly journal, Gems & Gemology. He was the recipient of a number of important awards including, the American Gem Society Robert M. Shipley Award (1983); Gems & Gemology Most Valuable Article Award (1986); Accredited Gemologists Association Award (1991), Modern Jeweler Lifetime Achievement Award (1995), and the American Gem Society Lifetime Achievement Award (2003). In recognition of his immeasurable contribution to the science of gemology, GIA in 1997 formally named its Carlsbad, California research facility the G. Robert Crowningshield Gemological Research Laboratory. He is survived by several nieces and nephews; a body of work which serves as the foundation of modern gemological science; and by a global family of gemologists, jewelers, students, and colleagues who will deeply miss his honesty, courtesy, kindness, and friendship.
