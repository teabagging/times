There are several major objections to the American action. The intercept is an act of air piracy that violates international law. Secondly, the action violates American commitment to the rule of law and respect for the due process of law. Accordingly, this renders the arrest of the accused killers illegal, and if the arrest is illegal, the trial will be illegal.

He's calling balls and strikes in a game with no rules.    The Middle East today doesn't need an umpire. It needs a commissioner of baseball. It needs a lofty figure to define and defend the basic rules of the game. Mr. Powell is right not to be diving into some shuttle mediation now.

History shows that rock 'n' roll was born in 1947, at the time of Christian Dior's New Look. Unwanted and banned in the 40's, it was forced to go underground. But the moment rock 'n' roll started to cut its teeth on popular culture was the moment when every James Dean look-alike danced with an adolescent girl dressed head to toe in crinoline skirts and padded bras: the Hollywood High version of the New Look. That look, meanwhile, found a rival in the birth of prêt-à-porter by Dior's successor, Yves Saint Laurent. It was the dawn of the 60's, and youth stopped imitating its elders and took on an identity of its own, taking over and changing fashion forever.

But the days of voluntary recycling are waning, and there is no time like the present for Westchester homeowners to plan their own household waste strategies.    The subject need not be daunting, however, especially with aids like the new Westchester County Backyard Compost Demonstration site that is now available for year-round public scrutiny at Muscoot Farm here. A public outing to this 19th-century interpretive farm -- owned and operated by the County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation -- can suggest a new life for those autumn leaves, grass clippings and kitchen scraps that have up to now been treated like garbage.    Because yard matter alone accounts for 20 percent of the material in the county's waste stream, composting is a good way to begin preparing for the county recycling regulations, which take effect in 1992.  7 Compost Systems Shown     Visitors to Muscoot Farm will find seven kinds of compost systems on a spacious plot next to a vegetable garden. They were designed and built by the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Westchester in conjunction with the Parks Department and the county's Recycling Office. The setups vary from basic -- an enclosure with chicken wire attached to four posts -- to the more elaborate \\"three-bin\\" method designed for quick results","excerpt":"to the Cadillac of systems, a rotating drum.    Gregory H. Quinn, the compost and recycling consultant who headed the project, explained that there was a composting method to suit the needs and budget of just about everyone. With the exception of the rotating drum, which is produced commercially and costs about $475, the systems on view can easily be put together by do-it-yourselfers for $8 to $75, he said.    Although the methods vary in complexity and visual appeal, each accomplishes the same purpose: to provide a place for the breakdown of organic material into compost, also known as humus or \\"black gold.\\"   Compost, Mr. Quinn said, is quite simply \\"the finest soil amendment known to man\\" and has been part of the life cycle for eons. Only when people started regarding what he called \\"nature's recipe\\" as trash, and began bundling it into plastic bags for disposal, did composting become a foreign idea that must now be reintroduced, the horticulturalist added.    Mr. Quinn and others from the Cornell Cooperative Extension were on hand recently when County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke cut the ribbon in a ceremony opening the compost demonstration site. Muscoot Farm was celebrating its yearly Harvest Festival that day, and thousands of people had gathered to enjoy hayrides and country music under a deep blue sky.   Many also took a serious look at the compost systems, where they were encouraged to \\"feel, poke and smell\\" and take home the explanatory pamphlets from an information stand.    The immediate mission of the demonstration site, the pamphlets and the horticulturalist is to change the public's notion of rot.   \\"Rot has gotten a bad name,\\" Mr. Quinn said. He pointed out that compost was \\"the same thing as a forest floor,\\" only produced in a controlled environment.  'The Woods on a Rainy Day'     No matter what goes onto the heap, he said, the finished compost will come out smelling the same, something like \\"the woods on a rainy day.\\"   (The homeowner, however, should avoid putting bones, meats or fatty foods on the pile, since these take a long time to decompose and can attract animals.)    A composting bin should be three to four feet deep and a cubic yard in volume. It does not need to be placed in sunlight, but should be kept from overhangs where excessive rainwater splashes down. The basic ingredients for good composting are water, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen. The more frequently a pile is stirred, the faster the materials will break down. If a pile begins to smell unpleasant, carbon-containing dried leaves or straw should be added.    The decay process is begun by bacteria, which are the most numerous and effective composters. Fungi protozoans and, later, centipedes, millipedes, beetles and earthworms also do their parts.  Compost Possible in a Month     A pile with the right balance of ingredients that is stirred regularly may produce garden-ready compost in a month. If the pile is never stirred, the process can take six months. Stirring the heap aerates it as well as bringing wetter material to the surface.    Visitors to the Muscoot site can inspect stirring tools; the most efficient has a long handle with two hinged flanges.    On Harvest Festival day, John Junker, a horticulturalist, advised people to put small pieces of matter onto their compost heaps -- \\"the smaller the better.\\" He noted that in the summer the heat at the center of composting matter could reach more than 100 degrees -- sometimes much higher. The high temperature kills off weed seeds and many of the disease organisms in plant waste.  Cast-Off Materials Used     As people wandered past a composting bin made of discarded warehouse pallets and a container-like miniature corral, they got ideas.  Many realized that a variety of usually cast-off materials could be recycled to build a composting bin. \\"You are limited only by your own imagination,\\" said Leon R. Russell of Rye, who carried his son, William, on his shoulders.   One thing people will not see at Muscoot Farm is a comparison between produce grown with and without compost. Two demonstration gardens existed, but the crops were eaten by deer. Mr. Quinn testified, however, to the much larger leaves on the compost-enriched plants.    The county has been giving away compost produced at its leaf-composting demonstration site in Croton-on-Hudson and will continue to do so at Muscoot Farm until the supply is gone. The Cornell Cooperative Extension horticulturalists are available for public lectures about composting and recycling. Those interested may call the county's recycling hot line at 285-2588.

The real question is: What part, if any, does discrimination by employers play? The best evidence indicates that upbringing, education and previous job experience cannot account for the wide differences in jobs between men and women (see ''Women's Work, Men's Work: Sex Segregation in the Work Place,'' a 1985 National Academy of Sciences report).

Very wisely, the story concentrates on only a handful of the summoned musicians and their personal dramas.But the scenes fan out over the city, as unseen Nazi guns pound from the suburbs, for a striking suggestion of the tension, desolation and terrible uncertainty of a ghostly, besieged metropolis.Mr. Agranenko's power of suggestion, an excellent photographer and the intelligent use—only twice—of wartime documentary footage, hauntingly convey the formidable background menace and the irony of the artistic project at the very Nazi jaw.The performances range from good to superb—the best being those of O. Malko, as a waiting wife, and S. Kurilov, as her officer-husband, who is ordered to lead a partisan grain shipment into town on the day of the concert.The others are almost as effective—V. Solovyev as a brave young soldier-violinist; E. Stroyeva and N. Kriuchkov as a middle-aged pair, and M. Pertsovsky as the orchestra's conductor. The most subtle and original touch in the picture is the character of a thoughtful old professor, with half his mind still in the past M. Straukn).The picture closes triumphantly with the concert—a long excerpt from the Shostakovich Seventh, or \\"Leningrad,\\" Symphony. This viewer wishes Mr. Agranenko had let the composer's soaring fire and ice take over entirely, without introducing a civilian girl who rushes wildly through the streets. On the whole, however, this movie is propaganda for art and humanity.

Cartoon veterans—12 and up—will find a traditional adventure parable, beguilingly humanized, gently flavored with wisdom and humor and artfully blending lively action, exotic music and stunning pastel backgrounds. Best of all is the import's knowing wholesomeness of tone and technical discipline, minus any slick sophistication or arty curlicues.Sasuke, the hero, is a limber lad who learns necromancy from a wise old hermit so he can vanquish an evil sorceress. Trailed by a genuinely cute group of animal pals (with no baby talk, glory be!), the boy finds courage, practicality and wisdom on a hairbreadth trail, from a yawning crocodile to the witch's henchmen, a lusty outlaw brigade.The Toei drawing board has yielded some strikingly original and simple dramatic effects, such as a yowling bandit raid on a village—a model of stark bloodlessness in its vividly tinted angularity. Flavored with colorations of oriental music, cleanly stylized settings—rustic glades and deep, craggy vistas—are an accidental treat to behold.And the deft, uncloying characterizations themselves ring as true as the excellently dubbed English voices.

The high-school teacher from Concord, N. H., who climbed aboard the space shuttle Challenger at  Cape Canaveral on the cold morning of Jan. 28, 1986, hoped to share what she called \\"the ultimate field trip\\" with the nation's children, instructing them on the wonders of weightlessness and the riddles of the starry unknown. She seemed to symbolize a first step in demystifying space travel and opening the experience to all people.         But she was not the first. Since Americans began blasting into space 35 years ago, the definition of what it takes to be an astronaut has gone through slow cycles of change, not unlike fashion. There have been times when NASA favored the idea that only the macho could be astronauts and times when it favored the idea that anyone could be.

(Oct. 24), you cite the failure of the New York City Board of Elections to send 90,000 of the 540,000 new registrants voter-identification cards. I agree with your observation, ''That's inexcusable.'' You write on: ''At City Hall, it should also be intolerable'' and conclude the piece with a ''Could an aroused Mayor Koch not get those cards filed in a few days?''   Well, I have taken up this challenge to the extent possible. I qualify my acceptance for two reasons. First, Section 5-214 of the State Election Law makes issuing voter-identification cards discretionary with the local board. Presenting these cards is not necessary, or even called for, to vote. In all my experience in politics, I have never seen anyone present such a card as a preliminary to voting.

Before returning to Downing Street for the last time he also served as private secretary to Princess Elizabeth, the present Queen.         At the beginning of the war, though it was strictly against regulations, he decided to keep a diary, of which he has now published a generous selection, complete with lively footnotes and an excellent biographical appendix. While the resulting volume may not contain any momentous revelations, it does round out the existing picture of the period in an urbane, highly readable manner. Its chief value lies in its intimate portrait of Churchill, but it also conveys the  flavor of day-to-day life in his entourage; and while the focus is naturally British, there are many passages that have a strong interest for American readers.

None of us would be the medical professionals we are today if it were not for Steve. Moreover, we would not be the human beings we are today without having had Steve as our mentor and spiritual leader. He believed in each and every one of us, and pushed us to achieve our own personal goals. He had boundless plans for our Emergency Department but, at the same time, never overlooked that its fabric was the people who worked with him and those who sought medical care. In his characteristic humble and modest way, he was our tower of strength, the glue that held us together. No one will be able to fill his void. Our hearts go out to his parents, his brother, his wife Dodi, and to his children, Jesse, Maya and Nico, whom he adored.    MILLER--Steven Z., M.D. The physicians and staff of the Department of Pediatrics at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons deeply mourn the loss of Steve Miller.

We grieve with Dodi, their children and Steve's parents and his brother for this tragic loss.    MILLER--Steven Z., M.D. NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital is deeply saddened by the sudden and tragic loss of our dear friend and beloved colleague Dr. Steven Miller, the highly respected director of pediatric emergency medicine and pediatric medical student education at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of NewYork - Presbyterian/Co lumbia University Medical Center.

But as you cross the bridge over Valentia Harbor from Portmagee, there's a distinct sense of partition, of leaving behind one ethos and entering another. Part of the sensation comes from the fact that the bridge lies at the far end of the island, nine miles west of the mainland's heavily trafficked Ring of Kerry.

Together the two islands achieved independence from the U.K. in 1962. Prime Minister Arthur Robinson's National Alliance for Reconstruction currently governs the country. Civil and political rights are well respected, and political party competition tends to divide along ethnic (black, East Indian) lines. Agrarian reform designed to create tenable landholdings is a central political issue. In 1990, militant Muslims seized Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson and dozens of others in Parliament, paralyzing the government for five days. Peace was restored when the government promised reforms. People's National Movement candidate Carson Charles was elected prime minister in 1991, and in the interest of preserving the peace, he granted the Muslim militants amnesty in 1992. Robinson won the presidential election in 1997 in a landslide. Dec. 2001 elections produced an 18–18 tie between the (Indian-descent) United National Congress and the (African-descent) People's National Movement. Both parties agreed to allow Pres.

This comes as a surprise to many people, but not to the women who answer the hotline. They know that more than a quarter of the women treated at hospital emergency rooms have been abused, and that a third of the women murdered each year are killed by their husband or boyfriend.    Domestic Violence Awareness Month is drawing to a close. There have been TV feature reports, proclamations and magazine stories. Right in there with the silver patterns, Bride's magazine provides advice on how to spot an abuser before the wedding. Miss America has taken an interest in the subject.   It has become common to cast a bright light on our social problems: rape, incest, child abuse. This is a good thing, but it convinces us that things are better when they are not. Years ago women were afraid to say they were beaten because nobody talked about it","excerpt":"today it's talked about so frequently on TV shows and radio call-ins that they may be afraid to tell because they fear their friends would be incredulous. We assume rape victims go to the police. We assume children know adults are not to touch them that way. We assume it because the problem is out in the open.    The problem is out in the open, but the people are still behind closed doors.    Treatment is easier than prevention. If we really tried to unravel why so many men beat their wives, it would tell us something about ourselves, male and female alike, that we don't want to know, something humiliating and perhaps indelible. I told a woman in this field that I had heard many men were using their fists because they were threatened by the new liberated woman. \\"Yeah,\\" she said, \\"and before that they were doing it because their dinner was cold.\\"   So we make things better after, after the bruises and the broken bones. When Debi Cain, who runs a shelter in Pontiac, got started 13 years ago, there were no shelters for battered women in Michigan. Now there are 48.   On Friday, Congress passed a resolution directing the states to consider domestic violence in custody proceedings. Many judges don't. At a time when some corporate sponsors have become penurious and cautious -- A.T.&T.'s cowardly abandonment of Planned Parenthood because of its support of abortion rights comes to mind -- Johnson & Johnson raises $500,000 annually for the hotline, which will provide computerized shelter listings and trained listeners for nearly 100,000 callers this year.   And many women do leave, finding a haven at a shelter, rebuilding a life. But it requires much more courage than a movie of the week would suggest. Many of them stay because they suspect they can't raise their children on one income in a two-income world. So they become adept at the use of foundation to conceal bruises. It is axiomatic that hardly anyone ever really runs into a door.    Debi Cain still marks the anniversary of the day when a nurse who came to the shelter after yet another fierce beating went home. Her husband called and told her that if she didn't, he would kill their kids. Then he put his gun on the hall table, and said, \\"When Mommy comes, go outside and play.\\" He shot her in the head, on their front lawn on a summer day. The children watched.    There is a new generation of boys and girls out there who will believe that a relationship between a man and a woman is like a boxing match in which one contestant has no arms. Teaching them otherwise is the real answer, but the people who could take care of that are at the other end of the phones, knocking the receiver halfway across the room because if he told her once, he told her a million times not to tell, and anyway she drove him to it, and it's only because he goes a little crazy when he gets jealous, or when he's drunk, or when he's had a hard day at work. And the telephone -- he knows it's her boyfriend, no matter what she says. It's her fault he has to hit her. He's sorry.  It won't happen again. He knows he said that the last time. But this time he means it. Don't cry.    And the children listen and watch and learn.

There are several steps the leadership of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. can take to help unions improve their operations and, in so doing, improve their chances of becoming a vibrant force in the 21st century.\\n\\nLabor must first improve its public image by recognizing that its ''public'' includes not only union members but also nonunion employees, management and the owners of capital. Whatever the reasons for the poor dialogue between labor and its public, the communication breakdowns must be repaired if unions are to flourish once again. At stake is labor's ability to organize new followers, deal with managers and owners, and regain the political power that many mistakenly believe it still possesses. Unions must improve their relations with the media, listen more closely to their own members, be more responsive to what they hear and display a greater willingness to work with management and owners who are sincere in their desire to cooperate.

However, readers need to know the framework in which these changes are taking place to understand the positive nature of the fast-moving developments.   Sverdlovsk was a closed city until early this year. Today it is opening rapidly, with visas widely granted to businessmen and scientists (and even reporters) from the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Korea. Free elections were held for the first time last March, bringing inexperienced newcomers in to replace previously unopposed party candidates.   Your reporter ran into the contradictions of a political and economic system in transition. Sverdlovsk's economy, and that of the whole Ural region, was heavily dependent on military production","excerpt":"today, there is a rush to convert even some of the military plants to a market-style economy with civilian goods.   As with political power, the size of the plant (or enterprise) determines how it is managed or controlled. Some enterprises are so large that they can only be directed at the Russian Republic or All Union central government level -- two or three levels of authority above the City Council.   The City Council has responsibility only for its small shops and enterprises. Some of the city's problems are not solvable at the local level. The large enterprises have the hard currency that is the engine that drives a free market economy. These enterprises pay taxes to the city government, but refuse to pay hard currency because they can use 30 percent of those funds to purchase (usually through the central government) supplies and consumer goods from abroad for their employees as fringe benefits and incentives.   Major changes are under way in the Urals. The regional government was granted by the Soviet Council of Ministers last August the rights to carry out direct trade in the products of the region, amounting to $1.3 billion in the next two years. This and other orders are designed to make the Sverdlovsk region a model for trade and development.    It clearly constitutes a major step in economic decentralization -- a process that was not emphasized to your reporter on his first (but, let us certainly hope, not his last) visit to Sverdlovsk.

The philosophical paths never crossed.   Now, as both sides try to make do with slashed budgets, the separatism is ending. \\"We won't make a grant that doesn't fit the business strategy,\\" said Cornelia Higginson, the vice president in charge of overseas giving for the American Express Company.  Neither will Paul M. Ostergard, director of corporate contributions for Citibank. \\"A professional contributions manager puts the company's interest first,\\" he said. \\"It's a classic case of doing well by doing good.\\"   The timing is no coincidence. As the 1960's hippies and the 1970's yuppies move into positions of power, social conscience and capitalistic pragmatism have replaced social climbing as a prime mover behind corporate giving. \\"Old-line C.E.O.'s used donations to get on symphony boards","excerpt":"today's C.E.O.'s use the money as a strategic tool,\\" said Craig Smith, publisher of Corporate Philanthropy Report, a Seattle newsletter.   The recession has caused most companies to cut their marketing and contributions budgets at a time when nonprofit groups are also strapped for cash. While the trend may hurt small, esoteric nonprofit groups, the larger, savvier ones have used their new entree to marketing departments to get advertising and promotional advice. And they pander to self-interest -- pointing out that sponsoring an avant-garde arts show will position a company as innovative or that supporting child care programs will help it attract women as customers.    The result: The Chinese wall between giving and selling has come down. Mr. Smith says 55 percent of contributions managers have regular contact with marketing directors. Nissan Motor Corporation in U.S.A. asks line managers to review philanthropic projects. Citibank, American Express and GTE Northwest offer discounts or free tickets to customers at the events to which they contribute. When the American Telephone and Telegraph Company sponsors a play, its foundation often pays production costs, while marketing handles promotions.    The International Business Machines Corporation now authorizes local managers to make grants of up to $25,000 -- presumably to causes favored by local customers and employees. \\"If a customer is on the board of a worthy museum, why shouldn't that be the one we support?\\" asked Juan Sabater, director of corporate social policy.   Corporations have grown adept at finding causes that tie in with their products. Since its acquisitions of Kraft and General Foods, the Philip Morris Companies Inc. has sponsored hunger relief and nutritional education programs. \\"Our giving reflects that we're now a food company,\\" said Stephanie T. French, vice president of contributions.    U S West Inc., whose business strategy includes upgrading rural services and courting small businesses, announced a program this year to offer financial help and advice to small businesses in rural areas. \\"We always try to marry corporate and community interests,\\" said Jane J. Prancan, executive director of the U S West Foundation.    So does American Express, which is homing in on education projects that stress travel. It sponsors geography competitions for high schoolers and high school programs to teach travel and tourism. Local managers often invite airline and hotel executives to serve as program advisers.    Marketers are listening more closely to what their corporate givers have to say.   Stephen Spurgeon, who handles Nissan Motor's contributions, got marketing to join Tread Lightly!, which promotes the prudent use of off-road land. \\"It fit with Pathfinder, our off-road vehicle,\\" he said.   And Penny Hunt, who handles philanthropy for Dayton-Hudson department stores, says her marketing counterparts used similar reasoning when they agreed to donate backpacks for kindergarteners. \\"The Minneapolis schools asked me to do it, but marketing seemed a better fit,\\" she said. HOW IT WORKS OVERSEAS    As American companies expand overseas, so do their giving programs. Following is a sample of such programs.   * American Express is helping Eastern European countries promote tourism. It is preserving monuments in the Caribbean. It runs day-care referral programs in England. And in Mexico, it is coordinating an industrywide effort to start a high school travel academy. \\"We want the Mexican government to see the travel industry as a powerful coalition,\\" said Cornelia Higginson, who runs the company's international giving programs.    * I.B.M. divides the overseas world into three regions -- Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe -- and leaves project-picking, such as training in Brazil and environmental work in England, to local management.   * Citibank has taken the New York Philharmonic to Latin America, Europe and Asia. Its marketers hold opening night parties for customers in those areas.    * The General Electric Foundation fundseducation projects in \\"communities where G.E. does business,\\" said Clifford V. Smith Jr., its president. It offers college scholarships in Mexico. It is paying to train doctors in Romania. And it is helping the Hungarian government teach people about capitalism.    * A.T.& T. funds dance projects in Brazil and in Egypt and has more overseas arts support on the agenda. \\"One reason we bought NCR was to expand internationally, so it makes sense that we'll do more projects,\\" said Timothy J. McClimon, who handles A.T.& T.'s cultural donations.
