Old rake of an English clergyman that he was, in ''Tristram Shandy'' Laurence Sterne found child-birth, like all of life, subject for satire.

That means it didn't set another record low, even though there were plenty of reasons for it to do so. The dollar started the week on a note of strength, having pierced the 1.50 level against the German mark. But then Saddam Hussein said he would release all of his hostages, defusing fears of a Gulf war and lessening the dollar's attraction as a safe harbor. The Government reported November employment data, which showed an economy falling even faster than expected with a loss of 267,000 non-farm jobs. And the Federal Reserve eased the Fed funds rate another quarter of a point, to 7.25 percent. The dollar fell under all this weight, but only to 1.4725 against the mark, a smidgen above its latest record low of 1.4705.

Developed by Broadcom Inc. of Mahwah, the system cannot transmit television or telephone conversations. But the company said it could relay about 500 words of text every two seconds, using transmitters and receivers, each of which costs less than $1,500. As with a satellite, company officials say, the new system would allow communication with the most remote places on earth. But it would be far cheaper because satellites, which often cost several hundred million dollars to build and launch, are unneeded in these cases.   The underlying principles of the technology, known as \\"meteorburst,\\" were well established by military researchers in the 1950's. But the technology never entered widespread use because of severe limitations. Inventors of the new system contend that they have overcome the obstacles and already have an experimental system in operation.   The technology uses the trails of charged particles, which continually appear and disappear as grain-sized meteorite specks bombard the earth's atmosphere and disintegrate. During their short lifetimes, they will reflect radio signals like a mirror. To bounce signals to a particular location, a sender has to find a trail that is positioned at the proper angle.   The systems essentially search for such trails, then fire off a brief message when they find one. The problem, however, is that the trails fade so quickly that the systems have thus far been unable to send more than a few words in a single burst.   The new system is designed to pack 100 times more data over each trail. For starters, it links as many as 10 low-powered transmitters, which each send identical messages in a combined signal. In addition, the system tightly focuses its radio beam on a particular trail, rather than broadcasting a wide beam that blankets the sky. According to the company, both moves create a more intense signal that can use each trail for a longer time and pack more data into each burst.   The company hopes to sell its equipment to corporations that want long-distance mobile communications systems for trucks, trains and people working in remote areas.   Charles J. Schmidt and Joseph Kadin, officials at Broadcom, and S. Eugene Poteat, a consultant, received patent 4,985,707.

When her voice takes on a churchy rasp, it holds both pain and determination.    Ms. Staton, 66, has the classic Southern-soul background. She started out singing in church and performed with gospel groups in the 1950's before moving into soul in the late 1960's. She had million-selling hits, sometimes turning country songs, like ''Stand By Your Man,'' into soul workouts. Even in the disco era Ms. Staton's songs held on to the storytelling fervor of soul. But as the 1980's began, she decided to return to the church, and she spent the next decade running her own ministry in Atlanta. Since the 1990's she has moved between devotional songs and positive-thinking secular messages.    In 2004 a collection of her 1960's and 70's songs brought her new attention, and this year she returned wholeheartedly to Southern soul with ''HIS HANDS'' (Honest Jons/EMI). Backed by a gospel-soul band with a pedal steel guitar sometimes slipping in from the sidelines. Ms. Staton sounds more mature but no less gutsy. The title tune is about an abusive husband, and song after song confesses to tribulation and smoldering anger. While Ms. Staton has been busy through the years, she has bypassed New York City. Her concert this week will be her first here since the 1980's. Wednesday at 8 p.m.","excerpt":"Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $25.
