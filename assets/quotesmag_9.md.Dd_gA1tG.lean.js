Liberals had generally opposed the death penalty and conservatives opposed the gun curbs. The vote in the House was 313 to 1, with Representative George W. Gekas, Republican of Pennsylvania, opposing the measure. Other provisions address victim rights, juvenile justice and prisoner drug testing.  National Endowment for the Arts    The House and Senate extended financing for the National Endowment for the Arts for three years after negotiators from both chambers reached agreement Friday night. Unlike current law, the bill includes no explicit prohibition against financing obscene art, leaving such judgments to the courts. The negotiators also dropped a proposed ban on support of artistic works that denigrate religion.  Foreign Aid   Both houses passed a $15.5 billion foreign aid bill. It includes a provision sought by President Bush to forgive $6.7 billion of Egypt's military debt. The bill would also cut military aid to El Salvador by half, to $42 million, and provide Israel with $3 billion in cash, military and economic aid and $700 million worth of military aid from American stockpiles. The bill does not specify an amount of aid for Pakistan, normally the third-largest recipient of American military assistance. The United States has expressed concerns about nuclear weapons in Pakistan.
