Those shops were finalists along with Grey Advertising in New York and West Wayne in Tampa,  Fla. The Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide unit of Cordiant P.L.C. in New  York had handled the account for 25 years until being eliminated in the review.

George E. Pataki. The law, based on a proposal sent to the State Legislature by the New York City Council last month, earmarks about $198.5 million in tax abatements to owners of co-op and condominium apartments over the next three years.         \\"We feel that this is the first step toward overall equalization of real estate taxes in New York,\\" said Martin Karp, chairman of the Action Committee for Reasonable Real Estate Taxes. The organization, which spearheaded the drive  for the legislation, has long asserted that current tax laws unfairly tax co-ops and condominiums at higher rates than other single-family homes. The law provides for gradually increasing property tax abatements for individuals who own fewer than three co-op or condominium units. In 1997, $8.5 million is earmarked for such abatements. That figure rises to $70 million in 1998 and then to $120 million in 1999.
