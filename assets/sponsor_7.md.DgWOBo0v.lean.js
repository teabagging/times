PKF Consulting says that room rates paid in May averaged $386.15 in the top-luxury category in Manhattan, a 15.1 percent increase over May 2004. Occupancy in that category was 88.6 percent -- up 4 percent. It can be difficult to find a hotel room in New York at any price. For Manhattan hotels in all price categories, the average occupancy rate was 89.6 percent in May (up 4.5 percent from May 2004). The average rate paid for a room was $240.23, up 12.6 percent from $213.30 in May 2004.    JETS BY THE HOUR -- Now there is a 10-hour card for buying private jet service. Through Sept. 30, Delta AirElite, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, is selling 10 hours of flight time on various private jets, rather than the usual 20-hour or 25-hour commitment. The new program, called Perfect 10, costs $41,400 for 10 hours in a light jet, $59,900 for midsize jets and $102,900 for large jets, a Delta spokeswoman said. Delta said the program was a way to allow its new private-jet customers to experience hourly membership at a low level of commitment.

US Airways does not break out domestic load factors, but its overall load factor in June, including international flights, was 81.2 percent. Southwest Airlines reported a slight drop in its load factor in June, to 76.2 percent, which was attributed to a sharp increase -- 13.5 percent -- in the number of seats available compared with June 2004.    MILEAGE CUT FOR REWARDS -- American Airlines said yesterday it was cutting the number of frequent-flier miles needed to book free travel for short hops on its Web site, AA.com.

Having trouble finding flight schedules to a remote island in the Caribbean? Interested in discounts for frequent travel? At least a dozen reservation systems want you.\\n\\nWith these systems, travelers can now handle most every aspect of a vacation or a business trip by themselves with a personal computer. The task is not simple, but a growing group of people consider the advantages worth the effort.\\n\\nDennis Gort, a doctor in Albany, books several vacation trips each year for his family of four using Eaasy Sabre, a reservation system from American Airlines that gives him information on nearly all carriers' flights. \\"I don't feel secure I'm getting the best fare until I look it up,\\" he said. When you call a travel agent or an airline, he added, \\"you're not certain they'll ferret out the most economical way to fly. And that's important, especially with a large group of people flying.\\"\\n\\nDoug Roberts, a sales engineer for Yamaha Music in Nashville who spends two weeks a month on the road, also swears by Eaasy Sabre, the granddaddy of airline electronic reservation systems with 1.7 million individual members. . \\"But it's definitely not for everybody,\\" he said. \\"It's for people like me who like to choose for themselves, not take what the travel agent gives them.\\"\\n\\nArmchair travel agents will become as common as armchair travelers if travel companies and on-line computer services like America Online, Compuserve, Prodigy and the up-and-coming network from Microsoft have their way. Travel companies want people to make their own reservations because it cuts out the middlemen -- the travel agents -- and thereby reduces their costs. And consumers are warming to the idea of booking their own trips as on-line computer services and the Internet get more widespread use.\\n\\nAll the on-line computer services offer interactive reservation systems like Eaasy Sabre, which reported more than 1 million bookings last year and 34 percent growth. Other prominent ones are Travelshopper, operated jointly by TWA, Delta and Northwest","excerpt":"United Airlines' United Connection, and Official Airline Guides Electronic Edition.\\n\\nDr. Gort, who uses a computer to pay bills and prepare his taxes and for such professional duties as medical research and scheduling, dials into Prodigy to get into Eaasy Sabre. He looks at airline schedules, fare choices and seat availability. In particular, he searches for flights from nearby Stewart Airport, in Newburgh, N.Y., because they are often cheaper than flights from Albany.\\n\\nAirline reservation agents, he says, aren't patient and don't do serious fare or flight searches. He has even managed to ferret out reduced fares before they were publicized in newspaper ads, he says. \\n\\nAfter booking the trip, Dr. Gort gets a six-letter confirmation code. Then he calls Travelers Advantage, of Stamford, Conn., a travel agency that actually issues the ticket and that gives 5 percent rebates on purchases in return for a $49 annual service fee. The savings can really add up if he uses the service for the many business and pleasure trips he takes each year.\\n\\nAirline tickets, though, are just the tip of the iceberg. Reservation systems cover hotel and car rental bookings, among other things. And the on-line services themselves provide a host of information about destinations and things to do for someone planning a trip. At the user's fingertips are maps, travel advisories, Zagat restaurant reviews, Lonely Planet guidebooks, numerous message boards and discussion groups.\\n\\nAndrew McKee, president of Adventure Media, a Cambridge, Mass., adventure travel firm, says interactive computer systems give a better preview of a vacation than a magazine article or brochure can. \\"An article can devote only so much space to a destination, a brochure only so many pages,\\" he says. \\"But on-line, there's virtually no limit to the information you can supply.\\"\\n\\nFor an abundance of information and more reservation choices, users can go straight to the Internet, which links millions of computers around the world and which is the hottest marketing tool in the travel industry.\\n\\nHyatt Hotels, Amtrak and the Russian airline Aeroflot are among the many companies to have established World Wide Web sites on the Internet to publicize their products and travel programs. Travel agencies, car rental, lodging, airline and tour companies are following in droves.\\n\\nA few pioneering organizations, namely Alamo Rent A Car and Holiday Inn hotels, even permit reservations on the Internet. Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, Choice Hotels and Thisco, which handles reservations for more than 20 major hotel chains, will do so shortly.\\n\\nWhy the push by travel companies to reach out to consumers directly? The rising cost of travel agents is probably the main reason. Commissions paid to travel agents are the airlines' third-biggest expense, after labor and jet fuel. According to the Air Transport Association, commissions accounted for $1.55 billion, or close to 10 percent of domestic carriers' total revenues in the first quarter of this year.\\n\\nTO help to reduce their dependence on travel agents, airlines are moving toward ticketless travel. Under this system, passengers receive a confirmation number when they book a trip, then give the number at the airport before boarding. The system saves carriers the expense of issuing tickets. Equally important, it encourages passengers to deal with airlines directly. Sometime soon, a passenger should be able to arrange a ticketless round trip from New York to Los Angeles on United Airlines using its electronic service, called United Connection.\\n\\nThe reservation systems, particularly Eaasy Sabre, win no points for ease of use, though. An updated version of Eaasy Sabre, which first came out in 1985, is scheduled for later this year.\\n\\nAs with any business done electronically, security is a major concern for both individuals and travel companies, who worry about computer hackers getting into their inventory of airplane seats, hotel rooms and rental cars.\\n\\nCompanies also are concerned about liability if a hacker gets travelers' credit card numbers or, worse, their itineraries, which could be used to plan burglaries. To protect against such problems, suppliers are building firewalls to protect their information.\\n\\nAt least for now, travel suppliers are expected to encourage consumers to make reservations electronically by offering incentives, like a 5 percent discount or a frequent flier bonus. Compuserve subscribers already can earn as many as 5,000 extra miles from United if they reserve 10 flights on the airline through the United Connection and complete their travel by April 30.\\n\\nTravel auctions by computer are also expected. Say British Airways has 20 unsold seats in economy class on its Aug. 27 flight at 7 p.m. between JFK International Airport and Heathrow Airport in London. It can put them up for bid on the Internet Aug. 26, and sell them at whatever price the market bears. (In essence, this is what consolidators, who deeply discount airlines' unsold seats, do today).\\n\\nNo one, though, expects the computer to replace travel agents completely. Edward Weir of Newtown, Pa., is a computer programmer who could navigate the reservation systems with relative ease. \\"Instead of finding fares myself,\\" he said, \\"I'd rather spend five minutes on the phone with a travel agent, and then play with my kid.\\" SPENDING IT;\\nHitting the Road Without Stopping at the Travel Agency"},{"year":"1929","title":"United Airports of California, Inc., with an authorized capitalization of 2,500,000 shares, has been formed by the United Aircraft and Transport Company to carry on an airport business throughout the country.
