But actually, nothing takes place suddenly, because he creates an intimate power play to contradict the jagged sharpness of the material. &quot","excerpt":"Suddenly&quot; was filmed in a stark, rough black-and-white style that grabs your sympathy immediately. We're introduced to Mao and Lenin, the tough girls who roll around the streets with the garish, crass charisma of screen stars. It's as if they'd emerged right out of a graduate student thesis film on Jean-Luc Godard. We catch them through the eyes of Marcia (Tatiana Saphir), a chubby, sweet-faced woman roughly their age who works in a lingerie shop; she regards them wistfully, with a hint of envy, as if she were thumbing through the page of a magazine. When Mao and Lenin invade the store, sizing her up as they drop ridicule, &quot;Suddenly&quot; takes a quick jump. The movie isn't judgmental about size or appearance; it's more interested in slapping down the bourgeoisie. It's a relief, because their prey, with her rounded, pleasant features and slightly awkward gait, doesn't deserve to be humiliated. The Argentine director is at his best in displaying his talents when there is little or no dialogue, especially as the sexual axis shifts between the three girls.

A couple who were to have been wedded at the dance hall that evening decide to disappoint the management. Cleaver and Molly agree to take their place and so escape their nagging parents. They acquire the apartment and furniture being awarded at the dance contest to the newlyweds. They are married and proceed to their new home after bidding farewell to their parents. But there is no peace for Cleaver and he leaves his wife, who is unable to do the more intricate of the terpsichorean steps, and wins more cups with a former partner. Cleaver and Molly are divorced. Later they are reunited and both return to their first abode.The film touches only slightly the pathos that might have permeated its reels, and the injection of low comedy passages makes for a discordant hodgepodge that fringes on the old theme song dramas and skirts the ridiculous too often.Grant Withers, as Cleaver, is the only true character in the production.

Many  schools more than made up ground they lost last year.    Nassau ranked first in the state in the proportion of students who met the eighth grade standard","excerpt":"Suffolk ranked third. Both counties also showed bigger gains than the rest of the state in the eighth grade.    In the Island Park district, where the proportion who met standards at the Lincoln Orens Middle School shot up by 32 points this year, the superintendent, Edward Price, cited a curriculum geared to the state tests and standards. ''We give examinations twice a year that mirror the states in content and structure,'' he said.    On the fourth grade test, gains in Nassau and Suffolk lagged behind the  statewide gain of eight percentage points, but both counties remained among the highest in the state. Nassau was second after Hamilton County; Suffolk placed seventh.    While the fourth grade scores varied widely from district to district on the Island, in general the best performing schools from last year showed little or no improvement, while the worst schools showed substantial, even remarkable, gains.    For instance, the 70 schools in Nassau and Suffolk where at least 90 percent  of students met standards in 2004 actually showed a slight drop, on average, in 2005. Fairfield Elementary in Massapequa was typical: 114 out of 122 this year, down slightly from 116 out of 121 in 2004.    By contrast, schools where fewer than 75 percent of students met or exceeded  standards last year posted an average increase of 10 percentage points this year. At Francis J. O'Neill School in Central Islip, for instance, only 41 of 92 students met standards last year, a drop of six percentage points from 2003. This year, 61 out of 93 students met the standard.    In the tables below, ''Perf. Level'' shows the four categories in which student scores are classified: 1 is lowest and 4 is highest. Level 3 and 4 scores count as meeting the standard. Figures are for the percentage of students in each category.    ''Pct. Pt.

For the first part of the concert, the five-man group appeared in traditional black robes and conical hats and performed a complete ceremony, with a call to prayer, short instrumental improvisations and songs of praise and a final incantation from the Koran. There were, however, no whirling dancers.   If, as it seemed, the audience was expecting the kind of kinetic, joyful improvisations of Sufi performers from previous concerts in the World Music Institute's series of Islamic music events, Saturday's concert was a letdown. The ceremonial music, composed in traditional style by Mr. Tanrikorur, turned out to be a sequence of stately, quiet, nearly monochromatic devotional songs, played and sung in unison by the ensemble: Hafiz Ahmet Calisir on vocals and small drums, Murat Tokac on ney (reed flute), Fahrettin Cimenli on bowed tanbur (a long-necked lute), Reha Sagbas on kanun (zither) and Mr. Tanrikorur on oud and vocals.

But onstage were eight seated musicians and singers led by a middle-aged man, without a guitar or an electrified instrument in sight, playing traditional music that dates back centuries. It was just one more jubilant show by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Party, the world's best-known group performing the Sufi devotional music known as qawwali. The group played a free concert, presented by the Association of Pakistani Professionals, in honor of Pakistan Day.   Qawwali is music with a purpose: bringing ecstasy to listeners so they can experience the divine. Like ecstatic music from gospel to Moroccan joujouka to techno, it has short, clear melody lines and a steady, driving beat, and it gathers intensity through repetition and improvisational flights. In his qawwali ensemble, Mr. Khan's voice is accompanied by tabla drums, harmonium and singers, sometimes as a chorus, sometimes as soaring soloists.

After weeks of daily clashes along the narrow street, which is divided between the Israeli-controlled security zone and the Palestinian-controlled area, Israel appeared increasingly determined to toughen its stance.   A3     Serb Police Chief Is Buried  In Bosnia, a funeral was held for a Serb police chief who had been shot and killed by British NATO soldiers who were trying to arrest him as a suspected war criminal on Thursday. Two NATO operations to arrest war crimes suspects have caused  panic among some of the top Bosnian Serb leaders, who fear they may be next, senior NATO officers and foreign diplomats said.   A4    Cuba Blames U.S. for Blasts  The Cuban Government blamed unidentified forces in the United States for bomb blasts that exploded in two hotels in Havana on Saturday. Neither the State Department nor the American Interests Section in Havana gave a detailed response to the Cuban accusation.   A8    Pugwash Leader Steps Down  Joseph Rotblat, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who helped build the atom bomb and then dedicated his life to abolishing it, said he was stepping down as president of the Pugwash Movement, an anti-war group he helped found. Mr. Rotblat, 88, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 with two other members of the Pugwash Movement, which was founded in 1957, calling for the abolition of war and nuclear weapons.   (AP)     NATIONAL   A10-13, B8    Guides for Mars Mission Youthful and Dedicated  Not only is the $266 million Pathfinder mission the first in a new era of ambitious Mars exploration, but it has also brought to the fore a whole new generation of planetary explorers, young men and women meeting the challenge with refreshing esprit.    A10    Sojourner, the roving robot of the Pathfinder space mission, began its second week of exploration on Mars. Sojourner was originally scheduled to explore the planet for a week, but scientists, who have reprogrammed Pathfinder's computer to avoid a glitch that cut off communication, now say they may prolong its mission for several months.   (AFP)    Confusion on Integration  The chairwoman of the N.A.A.C.P., Myrlie Evers-Williams, failed to deliver an expected defense of the concept of integrated schools. In her speech in Pittsburgh, two weeks after saying the group would review its position on public school integration, she had prepared remarks saying  that the civil rights organization would not back off from trying to seek ''equity'' in education. But the speech she gave made only glancing references to integration and did not mention school desegregation.   A10     Baron von Trapp Honored  Maria von Trapp, one of the six surviving children in the von Trapp family singers, gathered with nearly 50 people representing three generations of the von Trapp family for a Mass and ceremony that officially mended a relationship put asunder 60 years ago by the Nazi invasion of Austria. The occasion was a visit to the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vt., by 89 cadets of the graduating class of the Theresianum Military Academy in Austria, who chose Baron Georg von Trapp, a military hero who fled Austria in 1938 to escape the Nazis, as their class patron.   A13     Senate Hearings Defended  Senator Fred Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who heads the committee holding hearings into campaign finance, stood by his explosive opening statement that the Chinese Government had tried to influence last year's elections. There has been criticism that the first week of hearings was fat on innuendo and skimpy on details. In a network news interview program, he also voiced his displeasure over the partisan squabbling that erupted in the committee room each day.   B8    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-7    Setting New Standards For Procrastination  Surpassing its old record, the New York State government slipped past the 104th day of its fiscal year without a new budget. This is also the 13th consecutive year, and the 19th time in 23 years, that the Legislature has failed to approve a spending plan on time, by April 1 -- itself a national record for budgetary torpor. And the legislators? They were on break.   B2     Youth Dies Running From Dog  The owner of a pit bull has been charged with second-degree murder after a Bronx teen-ager trying to escape from the animal fell six floors to his death. It was the fourth fatal incident involving dogs in five weeks, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani referred to it in pledging greater police attention to what he called the problem of ''unlicensed'' dogs in the city. It was not clear whether the pit bull, which had been unleashed, was licensed.   B3     Complaint Board Criticized  No matter how large the budget or staff of the civilian board that investigates complaints of police misconduct, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said, it would be ill suited to penetrating the complex, insular culture of the Police Department. Responding to criticism that he has crippled the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the Mayor said that such outside investigations would never be as effective as the Police Department's own efforts to root out corruption.   B3    Campaign Law Scofflaws  A campaign contribution law enacted in 1974 to limit the influence of big business on government is full of loopholes and is routinely violated, a review of records indicates. A study to be released today, for example, shows that 31 corporations exceeded the $5,000-a-year limit in gifts just to New York City politicians last year.   B1     A Church Is Mourned  Dressed in their Sunday best, a half-dozen members of the Great Joy Baptist Church in Bushwick, Brooklyn, sat in lawn chairs and gazed across at the memory of their church. Its roof had collapsed the day before, dooming the building to a quick demolition. ''We're going to start all over again -- from the ground,'' said Rebecca Middleton, 62.   B1     SPORTSMONDAY   C1-8     ARTS   C9-16     OBITUARIES   B9     Frank R. Parker  The civil-rights lawyer and authority on voting-rights law was 57. For a dozen years until 1981 he was successively a staff attorney, assistant chief counsel and chief counsel in the Mississippi office of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights.   B9    BUSINESS DAY   D1-12     Managed Care Under Scrutiny  An avalanche of proposals for tighter government regulation of managed health care is advancing in the Legislature of California, a state that is leading a national surge of second thoughts about managed care. As complaints by patients increase, California is taking on a review of its system, with efforts that include the appointment of a commission to recommend improvements.   A1     Du Pont to Buy Chemical Units  E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company said it had agreed to buy some of the industrial chemicals units of Imperial Chemical Industries P.L.C. for about $3 billion. The move will be the next step in a plan to change the company into a specialty chemicals and consumer products company from a bulk chemical company. Du Pont said it was buying Imperial Chemical's white pigment business outside North America, its worldwide polyester films, resins and intermediates businesses and all related technologies.   D2     Web Sites Bring Mars Closer  As people across the country turn on the television to keep track of the Pathfinder mission to Mars, millions of others are getting their information from one of the World Wide Web sites devoted to the mission. The Mars landing may signal the start of a new interactive era in the mass consumption of news.

He seems not to have entertained the possibility that the music, like Eisenstein's elementally beautiful photography, transcends the clunky scenario that both of them serve. The first two times I saw the film, it was subtitled in a language I did not understand. No matter. The theme of a people's struggle to avoid subjugation at foreign hands was always as clear as it is timeless and archetypal, which is to say, beyond the realm of politics.   On the evidence of his article, Mr. Taruskin would reply that what is important in judging \\"Alexander Nevsky\\" is not esthetics, not even the fact that the film was made as propaganda, but the fact that it was propaganda for the archfiend Joseph Stalin. Well, it    was    1938. Perhaps it was not such a bad idea to rouse the Russian people against the German menace. It does nothing to palliate the crimes of Stalin to note that, when war with Germany came, the cost in Russian lives was more than seven million.   By insisting that we deal with \\"Alexander Nevsky\\" as a mere function of its political background, Mr.  Taruskin guides us to what is, I gather, the heart of the matter for him: Everything is politics. \\"Pretending art -- or 'classical music' at the very least -- is by definition apolitical,\\" he writes, \\"has done more than anything else to marginalize it and trivialize it in our musically disappointing century.\\"   I think not. During much of this century, many of its serious composers have wandered about in the thicket of serialism, but the mass audience has prudently declined to follow. This is why our century is \\"musically disappointing.\\" Now along comes Mr. Taruskin, suggesting we bid farewell to \\"Alexander Nevsky\\"","excerpt":"suggesting we stop listening to one of the most skillful, inspiring and accessible works of the period because of its alleged political incorrectness; suggesting, more broadly, that we measure the sky-aspiring world of art by the mundane ruler of politics.
