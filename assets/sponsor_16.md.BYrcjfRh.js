Nothing was known of the soldier's motive. Yasir Arafat, who had refused telephone calls from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, expressed his condolences and proposed a meeting.   A1     The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution to censure Israel's plan to build a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.   A12     Albanian Officials Arm Civilians   The Albanian authorities opened weapons warehouses in the capital to arm civilians who they hoped would help defend the government. Residents barricaded themselves inside their homes, gunfire rattled across the capital, and people bid up the prices of the last food supplies, awaiting chaos. President Sali Berisha and opposition parties appealed to the European Union and NATO to send peacekeeping troops.   A1     French Find Child Smut Ring   The French police detained more than 250 people and confiscated some 5,000 videocassettes in their largest operation to date to fight child pornography. Those charged with possession or trafficking in pornography involving minors were all men and included two school directors, two teachers and several others who work with children.   A4     Berlin Seeks to Expel Refugees   The city authorities of Berlin, uneasy with its population of Bosnian war refugees, ordered two refugees deported to Sarajevo, a symbolic gesture signaling a much greater forced exodus. The expulsion was the first since some 700,000 Bosnian war refugees fled to Germany as fighting engulfed their homeland in 1992.   A7     House Votes to Punish Mexico   The House voted to impose sanctions on Mexico for its failures in the war on drugs, while senators and the Clinton Administration worked to reach agreement on a statement that would call for progress by Mexico but carry no penalties. Senate members offered a nonbinding resolution as an alternative to reversing President Clinton's finding that Mexico had fully cooperated with United States drug prevention efforts.   A10     Gunmen Kill 13 in Egypt   Four gunmen opened fire on a road in Egypt, killing 13 people. Islamic militants were suspected. The assault occurred in a mostly Christian village 300 miles south of Cairo and was one of the highest death tolls in a single shooting since Muslim militants began a violent campaign to oust Egypt's secular government.   (AP)     Chernobyl in Financial Trouble   The Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine cut its power output by half because it lacked the money to buy fuel. It may have to shut operations in a month.   (AP)     NATIONAL   A14-27     White House and G.O.P. Revert to Budget Deadlock   The White House and Congressional Republicans deadlocked again over the Federal budget. The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott, declared President Clinton lacked the courage and leadership to deal with one of the main issues, saving billions of dollars by reducing inflationary cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other benefit programs. Mr. Clinton has decided not to look into recalculating how inflation is measured.   A1     Turnabout on Sexual Identity   A case once cited as proof that sexual identity comes from one's surroundings now is thought to indicate the opposite: that the sense of being male or female is innate. The case involved a boy who was reared as a girl after his penis was accidentally cut off. The child was thought to have accepted a female identity. But researchers revisited him, now in his 30's, and found he had renounced his female identity at 14 and had chosen to live as a man.   A1     Man Charged in Cosby Death   A Los Angeles teen-ager was charged in the Jan. 16 roadside slaying of Ennis Cosby, Bill Cosby's son. Investigators said the killing apparently resulted when the man, Mikail Markhasez, 18, attempted to rob Mr. Cosby after happening upon him as he labored to fix a flat tire. Police Chief Willie L. Williams credited a tip received a month ago by The National Enquirer.   A1     Hatch Backs Kennedy Bill   Senator Orrin G. Hatch endorsed a Democratic initiative written mainly by a colleague considered his ideological opposite, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, to provide health insurance for half the 10 million children who lack it. His announcement gave the bill, which would increase the Federal tax on tobacco to finance the coverage, a major boost.   A24     F.B.I. Follows Bomb Leads   The F.B.I. released images of nine people who were in Atlanta's Olympic Park before the pipe bomb explosion in July that killed one and wounded 111. Agents stressed that the people shown were probably witnesses and said they mainly wanted to learn if those shown knew anything relevant.   A14     Praise for Endowment for Arts   The National Endowment for the Arts won praise in House hearings for changes in its management. House Republicans had vowed to end its Government financing this year, and it is still unclear whether it will survive. But members of the subcommittee holding the hearing seemed satisfied with it.   A22     Hearing Turns Into Bickering   The hearings of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Anthony Lake's nomination to be Director of Central Intelligence dissolved into bickering after one Democrat, Bob Graham of Florida, said the committee was spending too much time asking about things like Iran's arms shipments to Bosnia and whether Alger Hiss was guilty.   A24     NEW YORK/REGION   B1-5     Deal Struck in Albany To Dismember Con Ed   New York State regulators and Consolidated Edison agreed on a sweeping reorganization that would break the utility into several pieces and give deep rate cuts to large industrial customers. Homeowners would get smaller cuts.   B1     Caution Urged on Cloning   Fertility specialists, medical ethicists, a former Nobel Prize winner and John Cardinal O'Connor, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, lined up to urge New York State legislators not to act hastily in curtailing or regulating research into cloning.   B2     Missile Theory Rebutted Again   The head of the National Transportation Safety Board went on television to rebut claims that a radar tape showed a missile hitting T.W.A. Flight 800. The board's chief air investigator said so much of the jetliner's center fuel tank had been pieced together that it was not possible a missile passed through it. But the investigator said it was theoretically possible that the tank had been hit by a missile fragment.

It was almost unheard of, until a few years ago, for buyers to be asked to share the burden.\\n\\nBuyer's fees originated in Europe, where auctioneers first charged them in art sales. In time, their use spread to stamp and coin sales in England and on the continent.

The gardens are open daily from late March to late May, 8 A.M. to 7:30 P.M., and admission is about $3, and $1.50 for children. (Telephone: 02521-19034.)
