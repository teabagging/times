And Miss Russell, the noted eyeful whose vision is equally perfect, replies, \\"so are you.\\" It would be a pleasure to say the same for the problems that follow in the wake of their marriage, which are the basic ingredients of this limp yarn. But, aside from some Apache ceremonials and the rugged Western scenery, photographed in vivid shades of Technicolor, \\"Foxfire\\" is not so hot.A viewer can detect the simple, obvious strains of soap opera almost from the outset, as our hero, after one of the speediest courtships on record, joins the smitten Miss Russell in matrimony. Will our socialite be able to make a home in this sleazy, little mining town in Arizona? Will her stalwart man, who knows the possible effects of intermarriage, be able to stick it out? Will she? Will his dream of finding that hidden gold mine sealed off by his forebears years ago come true? And will town gossips and his people's superstitions add hurdles to their union? A moderately perceptive observer, it is safe to say, will not be kept on tenterhooks.Jeff Chandler, who wrote the lyrics of the title tune, and who, we are told, sings it, does well by the role of the brooding, brawny and handsome engineer. Although his problems appear to be bigger than they actually are, he makes a fine, romantic figure of a man. Miss Russell, if the appraisal isn't redundant by now, is a fine figure of a woman in a variety of revealing gowns and negligees. Her cheerfully sincere efforts to make her marriage work are worthy of sympathy, but, all things considered, Mr. Chandler's acting rings truer. Dan Duryea does a competent stint as the bottle-hoisting town medico and Mara Corday is decorative as the sultry nurse who eyes him as much as his clients.Incidentally, \\"Foxfire\\" is described by Mr. Chandler at one point as meaning \\"the phosphorescent glow that comes from rotting timbers.\\" Unfortunately, this \\"Foxfire\\" rarely glows.

The same locale, same cast of characters, same actors and many of the same gags are repeated in this frank extenuation of the adventures of a middle-aged police marshal and a buxom village girl.But, as so often happens with sequels which have no place else to go but around in an uneven circle, this reprise lacks the freshness and charm—not to mention the occasional big surprises — that came with \\"Bread, Love and Dreams.\\" Again Vittorio De Sica, as the marshal, is having trouble with Gina Lollobrigida, as the girl, when the young policeman to whom she was engaged at the end of the last picture is transferred to another town.While his own true love, the village midwife—Marissa Merlini again—is making up her mind whether she should marry him, he is getting himself into jams that make it appear that he is turning once more towards the mischievous girl. The midwife and the young policeman, Robert Risso, flame with jealousy, and the circle of confusion is repeated. An earthquake brings affairs to a crisis.The ensemble of Italian village characters, so delightful in the previous film, is dulled by repetition and a minimum of amusing things to do. Likewise, the fluent personality that Signor De Sica conveyed is considerably less charged with vigor than it was the first time around. Though he talks quite as volubly and eloquently with his eyebrows, his shoulders and his hands, he is not quite as eager or audacious. He carries an obvious burden of care.As for the lovely signorina, she still wears the same drab dress which encases the same voluptuous torso. But gall seems to have got into her veins. She has become just a bit of a snarling vixen. And, alas, the revelations lack surprise.However, it is plain that the Italians mean to carry on the saga started here, for they have broken off the marshal with the midwife at the end of this picture and brought another midwife to town. She is beautiful, bold and bosomy—and she announces herself unattached.

By scheduling maintenance tasks according to the season, homeowners can perform repairs when weather conditions are most suitable and when results will be of greatest benefit. Here is a month-by-month guide for routine tasks.   January and all other midwinter months are best for indoor tasks like patching plaster and wallboard and for big indoor cleaning chores like washing walls, ceilings and floors, shampooing carpets and cleaning and routine servicing of kitchen appliances.   This is also the best time to fix floors and stairs that squeak, drawers that stick and wooden doors that rub against their frames. Because humidity is usually at its lowest, gaps and cracks in furniture and other woodwork are at their most extreme.    February is a good month for taking care of odds and ends. Rearrange or modify closets to make efficient use of space","excerpt":"straighten rooms that accumulate clutter, like the workshop, utility room or home office; sharpen tools and kitchenware; lubricate hinges, locks, cabinet hardware and appliance parts. Repair furniture, but put off refinishing projects requiring chemicals that release harmful fumes until summer unless there is plenty of ventilation.    Also inspect home security systems and fire-safety equipment, including smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and escape ladders. If you use a wood stove or fireplace regularly, perform midseason maintenance (inspection and perhaps cleaning) on the stovepipe or chimney to reduce chances of a fire from accumulated soot.   To combat midwinter blues, this is a good time to brighten both home and mood by applying new wallpaper or floor coverings.   March, with its rains and thaws, keeps many homeowners busy with basement leaks. With outdoor activities weeks away, this is a good time for indoor plumbing and electrical repairs.   March is ideal for beginning big indoor remodeling tasks. Knowing that spring will arrive soon, you might not feel so trapped in a house full of rubble. And with the worst of winter over, windows can be opened occasionally for ventilation.   April is the month for inspecting exteriors. Make spot repairs to the roof and siding if necessary. After the season's last fireplace fire, clean the chimney or stovepipe (or call a chimney sweep). Soot deposits will harden in fall, making removal more difficult and increasing the risk of a chimney fire.   If you have time, prepare window and door screens so they will be ready to install should spring arrive early. Take advantage of a warm, sunny day to wash Venetian blinds and shades outdoors.   May unofficially begins the outdoor-maintenance season. As early as possible, clean and repair roof gutters and downspouts, and begin planning major projects like painting, installing new roofing or siding, repairing masonry, and new construction. If convenient, prepare outdoor furniture for use.   June is the time to start the projects you planned in May. If several must be coordinated, begin with the ones that could cause trouble if not finished by fall. Because days are longer now, much outdoor work can be done.   July, with infrequent rain and the ground hard and dry, is ideal for tasks requiring excavation, like constructing patios and walkways, repairing fence posts and sealing the exterior of the foundation if spring rains brought basement leaks.   July is also a good time for window repairs and for indoor projects needing thorough ventilation, like painting and refinishing.   August is vacation time for many people. Finish large-scale summer projects and resurface the driveway (this is best done during prolonged hot weather); then take a well-deserved break. But before the end of the month, arrange to have the heating system checked to beat the rush and prepare for any early cold snaps.   September is the month for winterizing. Daytime temperatures are moderate enough to make installing attic insulation bearable, yet warm enough for doors and windows to be opened while weatherstripping is being attached. Caulking compound, used for sealing gaps, is also easy to apply; in colder weather it bonds poorly.   October days are short and evenings disappear when daylight saving time ends. Store summer items, including air-conditioners. Clean and sharpen garden tools before putting them away, and apply rustproofing paint to metal items that will remain outdoors.   Clean the garage, lubricating and adjusting the door. Before lighting the first fire in a fireplace or wood stove, check the chimney or stovepipe for debris left by storms or pests. And clean the chimney or stovepipe if this was not done in spring.   November ushers in the holidays and winter. Clean the gutters after the leaves have fallen. To prevent outdoor water pipes from freezing, shut off the indoor valves that supply them.    If your home has steam or hot-water radiators, you might need to bleed them of trapped air when the heat goes on for the first time.   December is usually filled with social activities, leaving little time for home repairs. Be thankful for small favors. If you have an urge to tinker, wax floors, polish furniture and marble, or clean chandeliers, ceiling fans and light fixtures.

Service's \\"The Roughneck,\\" now on view at the Central Theatre, is a boy's idea of adventure with plenty of scenes of George O'Brien's biceps and ankles. After observing all that Mr. O'Brien experiences as Jerry Delaney, one concludes that he needs his deep chest and brawny arms. Mr. O'Brien goes to no particular pains to conceal that he has the strength of an ox and the ankles of a Mercury. He has an artistic waist line, a physiognomy suited to adventurous rôles in melodramatic pictures and dark hair with the suggestion of a curl.Delaney is a judicious modern knight. In one sequence the pretty heroine. Felicity Arden (Billie Dove), is forced by a storm to take refuge in Mad Marrat's dwelling on the South Sea Isle. Jerry's mother is well aware of Marrat's designing brutality, and she therefore urges her son to hasten over to the other section of the island and save the girl, with whom he is in love. He is about to start, when he thinks it over, saying to his mother: \\"I can't go. I have got one man's death to answer for.\\"Jerry began to have adventures as a small boy, and he has them thrust upon him until the closing scene of this picture. No sooner has he escaped from drowning that he is asked to engage in a fist fight, which is delayed for monetary reasons until that evening.The fight appears to be going against the hero—as these conflicts usually do on the screen—when suddenly Jerry's opponent blurts out an insult about Jerry's mother, and he flares up and punches with such vim and rapidity that when they look at the other man he is thought to be dead.One of Jerry's passing adventures takes place when he is aboard a vessel bound from San Francisco for Tahiti. Felicity is on the steamship, and, as Jerry has been a stowaway, the girl urges him to swim ashore. It is a full five miles, which would not have been such a terrible task for this young gentleman, but Felicity had not calculated upon sharks. As soon as they are mentioned in a subtitle, one of these man-eaters appears, its dorsal fin being seen hurrying in Jerry's direction, acting more like a motor launch than one's conception of a shark. Here one has to be very young and quite credulous, for a native girl springs from her craft and goes to Jerry's rescue, engaging the fish in battle under water. One sees Jerry having his tussle under the surface, and then the lithe form of the girl putting a knife through the shark's belly.This picture is made up of this type of thrills, which are hardly convincing to an adult. The most capable actor in the cast is Harry T. Morey, who has the rôle of Marrat, the villain. He is well worth seeing. Miss Dove is attractice as Felicity and Cleo Madison is competent in the maternal rôle. Mr. O'Brien apepars to have a weakness for displaying his figure, but otherwise his performance is good.This is an extravagant story which is only likely to apepal to the youthful mind.

Global war and the attendant photographer have swiped the realms of the old-time travelogues. Yet there's nary a doughboy apparent in the streets of an Algerian town nor a \\"shuttle field\\" in the Congo nor a Jap on the road to Mandalay in the travel film called \\"Dangerous Journey,\\" which came to the Gotham Saturday.This lovely and fascinating picture, put together with footage acquired by Armand Denis and Leila Roosevelt on their journeys before the war, is as innocent of the current conflict as an old Martin Johnson film. Except for the narrator's comment that the peoples and places shown are such as American soldiers are now seeing every day, it has no significant relation to the 1944 world. Rather it is a compilation of beautiful random scenes and action sequences showing strange activities in Africa, India and Burma. And that's all.Most fascinating of the sequences is that showing the performance of the rite of appeasing the Snake God, a king cobra, by a high priestess in a Burmese cave. Thrice the fearless woman, unprotected by armor of any sort, kisses the head of a huge cobra which venoms and strikes at her. The performance, caught in close-up by the camera, is thrilling and suspenseful to watch. And, although the boys in Burma may not see it, this record is one for the book.Also exciting in this picture is the photographic account of the capture of an African elephant by native hunters, who ensnare the beast with ropes. This sequence is repeated from \\"Dark Rapture,\\" the Denis-Roosevelt film released six years ago. And there are some grotesque and morbid glimpses of religious fanatics in Benares, India.The rest is just pretty pictures of wild animals, primitive peoples and gorgeous spots.

I, for example, have never talked quite straight ever since.\\"Children of Paradise\\" was the quintessential Foreign Film. Europe wasn't that close then, anyway; no cheap air fares—an occasional freighter was the nearest equivalent—and young people didn't travel so much. They worked for master's degrees.And there, already into its career of perpetual revival, came \\"Children.\\" It was a \\"Gone With the Wind\\" of cobwebs. Its epic romance, instead of sweeping over miles of landscape was squeezed, Europelike, into the framework of a stage, the landscape all inward.These days some people are discovering, others rediscovering Marcel Carné's masterpiece. It is going through still another revival, this time at the Paris Theater. It looks to be as perennial as the Perseids.Expected and UnexpectedIt is in fact, both as expected as seeing a star fall and as unexpected. There is the scene where Jean-Louis Barrault, as the mime Baptiste in his white Pierrot costume, tries to hang himself, and surrenders his rope successively to a child wanting it for a skip rope and a woman wanting it for a wash line.Now that is a famous scene, quoted and recounted endlessly. Like some of the \\"Magic Flute's\\" arias it has a life of its own; and still it is impossible to watch without the small hairs' trying to walk off the back of the neck.After a quarter-century or so, a revisit to \\"Children\\" is cheerful and encouraging. Some things have grown fusty and cramped in it, but in general the damage of time is like the gilt flaking off a picture frame. It dates the picture within, but doesn't harm it.Some scenes—the opening street carnival, the drinkers and dancers in a smoky cafe—are cluttered and overcharged. There is a certain slow and mechanical contrivance in setting out some of the characters.Not Garance, though, the fatal woman played by Arletty. We meet her protruding from a barrel filled with dark liquid. She is indeed bathing naked, as the sideshow barker has promised, but all the customers get to see is her head and shoulders, comical and stately.It is part of the film's lovely alternation of humanity and fantasy. Arletty is comic and of a practical sensuality; she is also a haunting beauty; at the end, as her carriage melts into the crowd, she has acquired some of Baptiste's elusive transparency.Baptiste goes the other way. At the start, as the drooping Pierrot on the balustrade, he is pure air. His rival, Lacenaire, says that to kill him \\"would be like killing a ray of moonlight.\\" Gradually, passion subjects him to the laws of gravity. At the end he runs futilely after Garance's carriage like any stumbling lover with a churning gut.Even the cheerful, earthbound Frederic—another rival—has his moment of rebellious genius. And Lacenaire, the murderer, thinks of himself as a literary figure.The main characters are both clear and shimmering. They have their particular attributes, as in any normal movie, but they also contain the possibility of being their own opposites. Reality in this film is never a matter of \\"nothing but.\\"It is this that makes any memory of \\"Children\\" so complex. Complexity of this kind could fall into pretentiousness and incoherence, but it doesn't—and for a very simple reason.Mimes at the Top\\"Children\\" is a perfectly classical and conventional story. Garance leaves her criminal protector to take up with Baptiste and work at his mime theater. His love at this point is tangled in fantasy and he loses her to Frederic, the talking actor. (A fascinating motif in the film is its theatrical hierarchy that places mimes at the top and speaking actors lower down—and yet it is the mimes who are applauded by the workers in the cheap seats high up; the \\"paradise\\" of the title.)Garance, pressed by the police for her past associations, marries an aristocratic suitor for protection. Years pass, they all prosper, there is a brief reunion of Garance and Baptiste—consummated this time—and Garance leaves.There are side embellishments, of course, small mysteries and bits of fog. But they are scrollwork on a perfectly recognizable object. It is a big stagecoach of a movie — more than three hours along — that rumbles serviceably and creakily on a perfectly recognizable road.It is the passengers who are magic.

And, justifiably, they have accorded the Russians full credit for their stand on the Volga. Historians and the laity should find an answer to some questions about that now historic Nazi Cannae in \\"The Turning Point,\\" which came to the Stanley on Saturday. For in this latest importation, Soviet film makers reveal the strategy of the Russian High Command and the fact that some of them were erring human beings. Overlong and occasionally static, this offering, which has won the Stalin Prize and, recently, an award at the International Film Festival in Cannes, makes an absorbing addition to the military annals of the past conflict.Based, reportedly, on official records, the picture is a frank paean of praise for General Muravyev, who took command of the bastion when the German juggernaut was poised for its final assault. Assailed by nearly all of his staff for desperately-needed reserves, the general, responsible only to Stalin, was a lonely and misunderstood leader. His best friend, a young, brash and insubordinate general, had to be relieved of his command. Another, too conservative, had to be squelched. The secret, which the general had to keep against all odds, was that time and reserves were of the essence. So, stubborn resistance in the razed and gutted houses of Stalingrad upset the Nazi timetable and lured the German legions into the city.Frederick Ermler, one of the Soviet's top directors, has handled his assignment with deftness and pictorial honesty. His close-up and panoramic battle scenes are exciting and moving, especially one in which a dying soldier repairs a broken telephone line by clenching the ends in his jaws.

As two sides of the king's conscience, they are metaphorically joined even unto death. The image is compelling, and it is followed by a ''Lear'' of remarkable expansiveness. There is far more to this version than Lear himself, with Mr. Noble accentuating the parallel story of Gloucester and his sons and placing extra emphasis on the role of the Fool. Mr. Gambon's Lear and Antony Sher's Fool equally share, in Lear's words, ''this great stage of fools,'' a line that is a hallmark of Mr. Noble's approach.  Along with other characters such as Kent, Edgar and Edmund, the two are role-players who are carried away by their own performances. As the King, Lear can play the Fool, and the Fool is both coxcomb and wise man of the kingdom. Mr. Gambon is as willful as he is commanding, flexing his ego as he solicits testimony from his daughters, toying with Cordelia's suitors as he refers with almost incestuous envy to their ''amorous sojourns.'' Abandoning responsibility while seeking to retain power, he calls for his Fool, who curtly puts him in his place.

After several seasons, a Shakespeare play may be repeated but in a new and often inventive way, and continually the company is expanding its non-Shakespearean repertory to include other classics and, occasionally, modern plays. The troupe operates year-round in two theaters, one for large-scale productions, the other a small open space for intimate drama. This season ''King Lear'' and ''Peer Gynt,'' two Promethean masterpieces, are given bold dramatic treatment.

There is a constant flow of plays from the two Stratford theaters (the main festival stage and the smaller Other Place) to the Barbican's two similar stages. The best of Stratford (and sometimes less than the best) moves to London, creating a double platoon system of actors and directors, with each group representing a first-string team of artists. This summer the Stratford stars include Daniel Massey, Gemma Jones, Zoe Wanamaker and Emrys James in plays by Shakespeare (''Twelfth Night,'' ''Julius Caesar'' and ''Henry VIII'') and William Saroyan (''The Time of Your Life''), shared billing that would have delighted the late American writer.

And when a production staffed with such able actors as Christopher Walken, Anne Baxter, Roy Dotrice and Fred Gwynne seem far more interested in the novel side-effects they can cook up than in establishing the play's basic plot points, it would surely seem that there was something wrong - not rotten, just wrong - in the state of Connecticut.   Let me offer an earlyish instance. Mr. Dotrice, a Polonius with a Puritanical drift to him and already something of a moral automaton, has been volunteering his Guide to Good Behavior to son Laertes, just before Laertes sets sail. Ophelia, faithful daughter and loving sister, is also on hand to say her few words of farewell. Mr.  Dotrice, splendid performer that he is, runs through his list of precepts with a fine pinchpenny pragmatism, arriving at last at the notion that if Laertes will simply be true to himself ''it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.'' You've heard it before. What you have probably never seen before is what Mr. Dotrice now does. To put a period to the exhortation, he gives Ophelia a good, smart swat on her pretty blonde pate.

The opera's set never changes. It is simply the courtyard of the palace where Agamemnon once ruled and where now his wife -- his murderer -- reigns. There is also not an elaborate amount of action. Apart from the opening scene, Elektra, the King's daughter, half mad for revenge, never leaves the stage. The drama is so excruciatingly inscribed in the score, so much a matter of Elektra's interior life, that the work can almost be as effective in concert or sung in front of a closed curtain. Richard Strauss wrote an Expressionist symphony with characters.   But this one-act work poses greater challenges than might seem apparent at first. It is no easy task to bring these characters to life, either through sound or through action. And when Otto Schenk's new \\"Elektra\\" made its debut at the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday night, the musical performance itself was quite strong, but the drama was often thwarted. The staging was accomplished, but the acting was not. I found myself attending to voices far more than characters.

Had Stravinsky gone too far in his imitation of Baroque models? Did the libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman sacrifice dramatic force for satiric ingenuity? Despite all the second-guessing, the opera has tenaciously clung to the edges of the repertory, and it has been heard more often of late. Scattered flaws aside, it is one of relatively few completely viable operas in English, even if Stravinsky's musical personality keeps a curiously low profile.         It was given an unpretentious but effective performance here tonight by the Opera Festival of New Jersey, at the Kirby Arts Center on the grounds of the Lawrenceville School. This admirable organization presents one 20th-century opera in English during each three-opera summer season. Balancing audience taste and modern opera is a difficult trick, and \\"The Rake's Progress\\" is among the most plausible compromises in the repertory.

Three years ago, she broke a ram's horn off her forehead and pasted it on her body as a penis. The effect was as provocative as intended. But it was a solidly archetypal image that took Miss Chouinard's version of \\"L'Apres-midi d'un Faune\\" into the realm of the fantastic and the primal.   On Tuesday night at Alice Tully Hall, the Compagnie Marie Choui nard from Montreal tackled still another celebrated ballet initially choreographed by Vaslav Nijinsky: \\"Le Sacre du Printemps.\\" Performing to both taped rhythmic sound and the original Stravinsky score, the dancers echoed the past image of Miss Chouinard's faun as part centaur, part unicorn. When her sun-seeking tribe poured onto its mating ground at one point, men and women all sported two crescents, at the forehead and as a phallus.

Five of the six works seen in these two seasons were first presented by Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and both programs refer back to original productions that were highly experimental in their time.

He hit homers that seemed to threaten the jets in the sky over Shea. But he was no god, or even a demigod. He came to New York, a boy with a boy's troubles -- and a stick. He will earn $20 million over five years for swinging that stick for the Dodgers, and in time he may grow up to be an immortal -- a classic good guy, one for the Rotary Club luncheon, a more consistent fielder and hitter.    If he does, the City of Angels will have made the greatest steal since it absconded with the Brooklyn Dodgers.

The motivation behind the film seems to be that merely posing the question asked by one of the interview subjects &#151; &quot;Can you have Jewish life in Poland without Jews?&quot; &#151; is enough. That question comes up on several occasions, and the pain hangs in the air, inchoate and underdefined by the filmmaker. The movie is centered around the fact that Jewish culture has become a point of fascination for Poles, where Jewish cabaret is performed by gentiles. The film follows a &quot;Schindler's List&quot; tour of Poland, including Treblinka. &quot;Street&quot; mostly tracks a tour group that includes several American klezmer bands making a goodwill sweep through the country. They include the eager and happy Boston teenagers of the Klezmaniacs, bringing their sound to a land that has developed an appreciation for it. The movie obviously wants to demonstrate the oddity of the situation, but having someone reduce the Jewish experience to a vehicle for klezmer cheapens the case &quot;Street&quot; is trying to make; the audience members don't need to be sold on a subject they have already left their homes to see. Such an oversimplification seems ill-considered; it would be like saying the black experience in America could only be scored by the blues &#151; the type of patronizing remark that, once upon a time, people did make as a matter of course. &#151; Elvis Mitchell Jewish Music Gets an Odd Embrace In Poland"},{"year":"1952","title":"STRIKE CRIPPLES TORONTO","excerpt":"Streetcar and Bus Operators Quit for Higher Wages"},{"year":"1957","title":"43 INJURED IN TORONTO","excerpt":"Streetcar Collision Ties Up Rush Hour Traffic"},{"year":"1951","title":"NY Film Critics awards","excerpt":"Streetcar Named Desire top film; dir D Kazan hon 'STREETCAR' WINS FILM CRITICS' NOD; VOTED 'THE BEST OF THE YEAR' BY MOTION PICTURE CRITICS"},{"year":"1952","title":"comment on streetcar named Esterna Destra or Sinistra, depending on direction traveled, as tourist attraction TROLLEYING IN ROME","excerpt":"Streetcar Named Esterna Destra Circles City for Less Than Three Cents"},{"year":"1955","title":"CAPITAL BUS STRIKE SET","excerpt":"Streetcar Tie-Up Also Slated -- Deadline Is Midnight"},{"year":"1973","title":"Article on St Charles streetcar line in New Orleans, last surviving streetcar line in city and 1 of last in US to continue operating with vintage equipment","excerpt":"streetcars, which travel 6 1/2 mi route, described; illus; history of line detailed St. Charles Is the Last Trolley Left"},{"year":"1967","title":"There are no shortages in auctions this week for collectors of specialties, particularly those who are looking for written and printed Americana.
