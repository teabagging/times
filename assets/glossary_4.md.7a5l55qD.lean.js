She flings her clenched fist at her feverish brow, throws back her head in utter despair and rushes up the stairs and out of her fianc'e life, forever, so she thinks.Then, too, a thinner, newly coiffured Miss Bow sings with a lilt in her mannerisms reminiscent of night club performers. She also permits Stanley Smith, who acts the part of the son of a railroad president, to make love to her to the tune of a convenient radio. Mitzi Green, a 9-year-old girl, as Penelope, has continued to win laurels since her appearance in \\"Sweetie\\" and \\"Paramount on Parade.\\" Little Miss Green's imitation of Miss Bow singing \\"Rarin to Go\\" compares favorably with the star's peformance if the reaction of yesterday's audience is any criterion. The child's captivating manner is a welcome relief from the usually precocious screen infant, as are also the performances of Stuart Erwin and Richard Gallagher as the unlucky suitors.The story, a trite affair, concerns the son of the railroad president who is learning the business froth the rails up and who appears at the restaurant at which Pepper (Miss Bow) is a waitress. He falls in love with her and takes her to his home in Palm Beach, where paramount society has gathered. The enraged father, scheming to separate the two, finally agrees with Pepper, after she has seen through his plans, to stage a party at which she will prove herself a waitress. So she subjects herself to a martyrdom for her beloved.The plan works, as it has in so many films before, and the girl prepares to leave for home, but the father, overhearing Pepper's friends telling each other what a great girl Pepper is, relents and allows the union, but not until the son has coyly disguised himself in a chauffeur's clothes and said \\"Boo!\\" Miss Bow is surprised, but nobody else, including yesterday's audience, was.

You describe the case of an unnamed American scholar (he apparently did not know Russian) who had his appendix removed in the Soviet Union last year in a provincial hospital, without antibiotics. It was a positive experience.   In contrast to health services in the United States, where he had a second appendectomy last month, \\"he felt    cared    for.\\"   No one disputes the generous warmth of Russians in their private lives. But to rethink the merits of the Soviet system versus our \\"superbly equipped but impersonal\\" emergency wards on the basis of this story is simply absurd. How a foreigner is treated in that land of crooked mirrors is no index of reality -- and certainly no index of victory in the cold war.   If anecdotes are desired, check out a Soviet citizen (who cannot find aspirin, much less antibiotics, and never rates a smile from his country's gray and pervasive officialdom). It's how a system values the life of its own people that should be the focus of Western concern as we consider aid to the Soviet body politic, so desperately sick and at last on the historic brink of admitting that it is sick by its own hand.

At Baladi, the new, and only, Egyptian restaurant in Montclair, Nancy, the blond belly dancer (from Manhattan not Egypt), can be counted on to dazzle on Friday and Saturday nights. Our son Miles, who is 5, was enchanted with Nancy, but not enchanted enough, apparently, to accept her invitation to dance. His 13-year-old brother, Paul, felt likewise. As no one else was invited to join her, we were free to concentrate on the swords that replace the chandelier and that she used to slash the air and, luckily, nothing and nobody else. All this and hummus too. ''My heart is in Egypt,'' says Neamet el-Sayed, 41, the owner and chef, who was born in Cairo and now lives in Hoboken. Baladi (pronounced balla-DEE) is Arabic for ''countryside,'' which Mr. El-Sayed approximates most glamorously. Under filmy dark blue tents, diners are served traditionally lamb-based Egyptian meals, among them mozza dani, apricot-braised lamb shank. For those who prefer their little lambs scampering safely with Mary, Baladi offers such entrees as samek bofteak (pistachio-crusted catfish with dried limes, baby okra and tahini) and vegetable tajine (sauteed artichokes, zucchini, butternut squash, chickpeas and potatoes with juniper essence and saffron couscous with dried cherries). Hummus (chicpea puree with tahini, lemon juice and garlic), baba gannouj (charred eggplant puree) and kebda (pan-seared calves' liver with pickled vegetables), all served with hot puffy pita triangles, are little meals masquerading as appetizers. Our dessert, konafa - dense Belgian chocolate topped and bottomed with crispy shredded phyllo - was as mesmerizing as Nancy's shimmies and shakes. But by this time Nancy had left the ubilding, and our forks did all the dancing.       ANDREA HIGBIE        Baladi, 515 Bloomfield Avenue, Montclair, N.J. (973)509-6544.

Allaying Wall Street's biggest fear, Microsoft reported that Windows 95 was selling very well indeed and that its earnings were up 58 percent. Intel, Sun Microsystem, Silicon Graphics and I.B.M. were also strong performers","excerpt":"Apple Computer was the major disappointment, down 47.6 percent. Pharmaceutical companies and brokerage houses also had strong quarters, and General Motors beat expectations. But Ford Motor took a stiff loss, its profits down 68 percent as costs rose and overseas sales slipped. The Dow, the S. & P. 500 and the Big Board composite rode the news to record highs.  ALARM BELLS  So Much for Oversight  The Federal Reserve and Daiwa Bank's management won no applause for their review of trading problems at the bank's New York branch. A former Fed official disclosed that nearly two years before Daiwa disclosed its $1.1 billion loss from unauthorized trading, the president of the New York Fed had met with Daiwa to discuss the employee, Toshihide Iguchi, and his trading practices. Clearly the followup left a lot to be desired. As Mr. Noguchi pleaded guilty in Federal court to a variety of charges, both he and prosecutors said two senior executives at Daiwa conspired to conceal the loss. Daiwa said only that it was continuing its own investigation. SAFETY NET  Dialing for Dollars  Concerns about Japanese banking go far beyond Daiwa. The Federal Reserve put in place a system to provide Japanese financial authorities with billions of dollars in cash, almost instantly, in exchange for U.S. Treasury bonds and bills held by the Japanese. The goal is to avert a catastrophic bank collapse that would ripple around the globe. And because the Treasury would receive its own issues in exchange for the cash, the safety net appears to be risk free.  TAXES  Stumbling on the High Wire  First President Clinton told a group of business executives that he had raised taxes \\"too much\\" in his first budget, providing comfort to Republican critics and infuriating Democrats who had stood by him at the time. A day later, he backtracked and said he was \\"very, very proud of what I did.\\"   TRADE  Progress, Setbacks  The good news about trade? The U.S. trade deficit fell sharply to $8.8 billion in August, helped by a surge in exports, especially to Western Europe. The bad news? The U.S. trade deficit with China grew 18 percent to $3.9 billion for the month -- more than three-quarters the size of the much-publicized deficit with Japan, which was essentially unchanged, at $5.1 billion. BANKING  Deal of the Week  Hostile takeovers are rare in the world of banking, in part because of the regulatory approvals needed, but Wells Fargo plunged in with a whopping $10 billion bid for First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles, a company it has long coveted. First Interstate, which holds a strong position in 14 Western states, said it was \\"deeply disappointed with this uninvited action,\\" but Wall Street and investors, who bid up Wells Fargo stock, reacted with enthusiasm. DISSONANCE  A Nod to Shareholders  Some large institutional shareholders of Archer-Daniels-Midland have been sharply critical of how cozy the company's directors are with management, all the more so after it was learned the Government was investigating the giant food processing company for possible price-fixing. At the annual shareholders meeting, the crusty chief executive, Dwayne O. Andreas, the chief executive, cut off his critics, but the board did agree to appoint a committee to recommend changes. SEATS  Big Board, Big Seat  A seat on the New York Stock Exchange sold for $1 million -- the first time in seven digits since just before the 1987 crash and up $50,000 from the last sale in September. The price is four times the recent low, in 1990. By contrast, the Dow Jones industrial average is less than three times its post-crash low. The current price remains below the record high of $1.15 million, a month before the 1987 crash. And what does the buyer get for $1 million? One of 1,366 seats that confer the right to trade stocks on the floor of the Big Board, an activity that involves a lot of running around. Buying a seat does not provide a place to sit.

With apologies for the delay to her friends and colleagues, it is with regret that we advise that Frances Cooke Macgregor, an expert on the psychological effects of facial deformities, died on Christmas Eve (2001) at her retirement home in Carmel, California. She was 95 and died of congestive heart failure. She was a renowned social scientist whose research and writing on the social and psychological significance of facial differences was the first acknowledgement of disfigurement as a disability. Her publications document 40 years of research. Mrs. Macgregor was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up in San Rafael, California and earned a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1927. She moved to Massachusetts several years later and in 1933 married the late Gordon Macgregor, an anthropologist for the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. They later divorced. While they were married, the Macgregors visited Indian reservations around the country. A professional photographer at the time, Mrs. Macgregor took pictures that captured daily life on the reservations. Those photographs, published in 1941 in a book entitled, ''Twentieth Century Indians'', helped prompt Congress to devote more money to Indian reservations. Other pictures Mrs. Macgregor took over the course of a year in the small Massachusetts town of Hingham, were also published in 1941 in a book called, ''This Is America'', with text written by her friend, former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. In the 1940's, Mrs. Macgregor moved to New York City and did graduate work in anthropology at Columbia University under Dr. Margaret Mead. Mrs. Macgregor obtained her master's degree in sociology at the University of Missouri in 1947. Her work on facial disfigurement began during World War II while photographing patients at the Ellis Fischel Cancer State Hospital in Columbia, Missouri. Shortly after the war, she met plastic surgeon Dr. John Marquis Converse, who helped repair the shattered and burned faces of French and English pilots. His specialty coincided with her interest in social and psychological ramifications of facial disfigurement. Dr. Converse accepted her suggestion to conduct an exploratory study of his patients. At that time, the existing literature on physical disabilities was limited almost entirely to functional impairments: the loss of a leg, blindness, deafness and so on, and the problems of physical rehabilitation. As for those whose faces happen to deviate from the norm, there was and is, a special irony with which they must contend. Their problems have their roots in the inextricable relationship of the face to the person and its role in human relations. Moreover, it is a situation made even worse in a society whose frenetic efforts to look young and beautiful makes looking different a social stigma-a stigma that has the potential for social and psychological death. Her work led to the World Health Organization adding facial disfigurement to its list of disabilities. In 1951 The Society for the Rehabilitation of the Facially Disfigured was established. Now known as The National Foundation for Facial Reconstruction, the Foundation helps fund the work of the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at New York University Medical Center. Mrs. Macgregor remained in close touch with Dr. Joseph G. McCarthy, who became Director of the Institute following the death of Dr. Converse in 1981. The innovative streak in Macgregor drew the attention of the Russell Sage Foundation where she did a threeyear study at the New York Hospital, Cornell University School of Nursing in order to introduce social science into the education of nurses. She published a textbook, ''Social Science in Nursing","excerpt":"Applications for the Improvement of Patient Care'' (Russell Sage Foundation, New York, 1960). She became a full professor teaching at Cornell University Medical and Nursing School from 1954 to 1968 then rejoined the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at NYU Medical Center. In 1991, Macgregor moved from New York City to Carmel, California. She continued her consultancies adding legal clients as well as medical colleagues and patients. Magregor's last research efforts focused on iatrogenic illness. Years before it was frontpage news in the New York Times (Sunday, December 19, 1999), she wanted her philanthropic funds to go to studying medical errors caused by physicians and other health professionals. On the same page as the continuation of The New York Times article of December 19, 1999, ''Breaking Down Medicine's Culture of Silence'', the Institute of Medicine estimated that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical errors. Macgregor had already contributed to studies by the Institute of Medicine and also the Harvard Medical School in her name through the aegis of The Commonwealth Fund. She has left her estate to The Commonwealth Fund who will administer the Frances Cooke Macgregor Awards for further study of iatrogenic illness. At a private ceremony on January 4, 2002, Frances Cooke Macgregor was buried at the family burial plot beside her father, mother, brother and nephew at the Mt. Tamalpais Cemetery in San Rafael, California.

Applied Materials has scheduled a news conference for Friday where it is widely expected to introduce its offering in so-called CMP, or chemical mechanical planarization, tools. CMP tools, which are currently being sold by two much smaller companies -- the Integrated Process Equipment Corporation and Ontrak Systems Inc. -- enable chip makers to polish individual layers of a chip to make them flatter, without applying high heat that would melt metal layers.

Analysts inside the Administration and out pointed to several additional calculuses in the rejection of an International Trade Commission finding that copper was hurting enough to be due protection. On the purely economic level, the 8 to 10 cents a pound increase in domestic copper prices that protection would bring might well cost more jobs in the American fabricating sector (which employs 150,000 workers) than it would save in the mining sector (which employs 25,000). On the electoral level, they noted, copper fabricators live in states with many more electoral votes, and ones where President Reagan is less strong politically, than do copper miners, who are clustered in the Rocky Mountain states.

Monday at 8 p.m. on Showtime 2.  It won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It made a ton of money. But in the end, Michael Moore's mischievous, powerfully anti-Bush film will have to be remembered as the documentary that didn't bring down a president. Even with Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, testifying about a pre-Sept. 11 report, ''I believe the title was 'Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States.''' Maybe the ''Bonanza'' parody is a little over the top, but when Mr. Moore (above right, with Representative John Tanner, a Tennessee Democrat) urges members of Congress to send their own children to fight in Iraq, he quietly hits his target. He also gives the other side its say, in a way. ''I think we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes,'' announces a gum-chewing Britney Spears.    THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (1968)  Saturday at 9 p.m. on Channel 13.  Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen), the antihero of Norman Jewison's satisfying crime thriller, is very rich. He dismisses his grand home as ''just a big, empty place -- three floors and an elevator.'' When a bank is robbed of $2.6 million, Crown is the last guy you would suspect. And yet a glamorous insurance investigator (Faye Dunaway, right, with McQueen) does suspect him, and she has some unorthodox investigation techniques: a romantic fireside chess game, shared saunas, dune-buggy outings, a passionate affair. It's not ''Citizen Kane,'' but the stars could get by on style alone.    LEGALLY BLONDE (2001)  Sunday at 8 and 10 p.m. on TBS.  At 25, Reese Witherspoon (left) had received some excellent reviews in films like ''Election'' and ''Pleasantville,'' but when she starred in Robert Luketic's comedy about an adorably determined California sorority girl, she became a Hollywood darling overnight.

When Christopher Monger's quirky and quirkily named comedy opened, some expected it to be a star vehicle for Hugh Grant, who had made it big the year before in ''Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' But Mr. Grant (right, with Tara Fitzgerald) is just part of the ensemble, playing a cartographer who gives some Welsh villagers bad news: the ''mountain'' they're so proud of is only 984 feet tall and therefore just a hill. The villagers decide to change that, and the solution involves dirt.

Elsley, an Englishman and professional horticulturist in this country, was editor of the American edition of ''The Well-Chosen Garden'' written by Christopher Lloyd. In his introduction to this extraordinarily readable book, Mr. Elsley points out that basic differences exist in the American's overall approach to gardening in comparison to his British counterpart. These differences are influenced by ''the American lifestyle and the considerable extremes and variations of regional climates.'' These factors, he points out, greatly impair the practical value of most imported publications.  When it is considered that the United States stretches from coast to coast, embraces nine hardiness zones and includes soil types from the highly acidic Northeast to the highly alkaline Southwest, it is no wonder that ''general'' garden books rarely apply. American readers must be knowledgeable and plant recommendations read with restraint for, in many cases, British authors, who are writing for their own country, do not make that leap across the ocean. Also as Mr. Elsley points out the American lifestyle embraces many pursuits, among them gardening.
