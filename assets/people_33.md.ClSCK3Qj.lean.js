In the United States the figure is only 75 percent, with serious consequences for those left out and for the society: premature babies, many of whom require costly intensive care, and a high infant mortality rate. Tonight's well-wrought documentary, \\"Borderline Medicine,\\" attributes Canada's success in caring for prospective mothers and infants to its national health system, which assures equal attention to all, with the tab being paid through taxes. In the United States, the narrator, Walter Cronkite, observes, prospective patients are subject to \\"a wallet biopsy\\" and those who show up negative are denied the best treatment.   But the program, at 10 P.M. on Channels 13 and 49, also looks at weaker aspects of Canadian medicine, notably its inability to assure prompt, ultramodern diagnosis and surgery. A Canadian in need of a heart bypass, for example, may have to wait several months. In the United States, such an operation could be done within 24 hours, and Canadians who can afford it cross the border for immediate attention. But the program contends that the downside on this side of the border is the penchant of doctors to do needless operations at substantial costs both in money and lives.

In 1988, Little Feat reappeared with a new singer, Craig Fuller, and guitarist, Fred Tackett. The band performed on Tuesday night at the Beacon Theater to mark the release of a new album, \\"Shake Me Up\\" (Morgan Creek).    Sam Clayton, the band's conga player, was ill and did not appear. But even without the extra layer of cross-rhythm, the songs swaggered and crackled. In the 1970's, the band blended New Orleans rhythm-and-blues, country, hard-rock and touches of funk and jazz.

L/G Research Inc., a San Francisco money manager that invests in no-load funds, says it does not usually pay to put your money in bonds. At least not when you compare the results with that of stocks. L/G studied the return on stocks versus bonds in 1-, 3-, 5-, 10- and 15-year periods, and found that stocks almost always beat bonds. Indeed, over 15-year periods, stocks do better 94 percent of the time, L/G said. The average one-year return of 12.4 percent by stocks is more than double that of bonds in the 55-year period that was studied, said Ken Gregory, editor of the L/G No-Load Fund Analyst newsletter. Like most good things, though, the happy returns come at a price. Stocks are riskier, Mr. Gregory said, declining more than bonds in bad years. The worst 12-month performance of bonds was a 5 percent loss, he said, while the worst year for stocks was a 50 percent loss.

A recent study commissioned by the Insurance Information Institute, \\"Rating the Risks, Assessing the Solvency Threat in the Financial Services Industry,\\" concluded that the insurance industry's problems were not nearly so severe as those in banking. Orin S. Kramer, a consultant based in New York, discussed the study, which he wrote.   Q. What are the problems shared by banks and insurance companies?    A. Over the past two decades, each sector has experienced declining profitability, the loss of attractive customers to alternative markets, rising risk levels and increased insolvencies. Each of the sectors also suffers from excess capacity. But the similarities should not obscure the fact that there are sharp differences among individual institutions and between the sectors.     Q. Banks are suffering mightily from problems with real estate loans. How much expo sure do insurers have in real estate?    A. Real estate and mortgages represent only 3 percent of assets for property and casualty insurers and 22 percent for life companies. But at least relative to the banks, there are three factors that mitigate the life insurance real estate exposure.   First, over the 1980's commercial real estate investment by insurers declined, whereas for banks it was the fastest-growing loan category. Consequently, most insurers have a more seasoned loan portfolio. Second, banks are more heavily involved at the riskier front end of the real estate financing process, making loans for construction and providing financing until long-term lenders are found. Nonperforming commercial real estate as a percentage of assets is more than 60 percent higher for banks than for insurers.    Q. What are the other major risks for insurance companies?    A. For the property and casualty sector, the major risks arise out of public policy. For example, there is the risk that the courts will impose significant environmental cleanup liability, the threat of more restrictive rate regulation and the absence of a Federal backup facility to handle a severe earthquake.    Q. What about the life insurance companies?    A. Beyond real estate, their higher-risk category of assets is \\"junk bonds,\\" where there are a couple of companies that have excessive exposures and are now paying the price. But for the sector as a whole, non-investment-grade bonds represent under 4 percent of assets. A substantial share of those bonds are private placements, which have special covenants and tend to be well secured.    Q. How did you compare the risks of industries as different as banking and insurance?    A. Except under the most extreme scenarios, whatever solvency threat that may exist is limited to the weakest players. One test we did was to ask how long it would take for the bottom 20 percent of companies in each sector to exhaust their capital, assuming they continued to earn or lose money at the average 1987-89 rate.    The bottom fifth of the property and casualty industry was profitable every year from 1987 to 1989. But the bottom fifth of the life industry had negative income in two of the three years and would exhaust its net worth in the year 2028 if those results continued. For banks, the losses in 1987-89 of the bottom fifth of the industry were great enough that they would exhaust their capital by the end of 1994.     Q. Is a solvency crisis likely for any of the three industries you studied?    A. It is important to distinguish between theoretical possibilities and realistic probabilities. While I can imagine conditions that might produce insolvency for a major insurance company, I think that is extremely improbable over the next several years, and a generalized insurance solvency crisis is even less likely. For the banking industry, there will clearly be enough trouble to require a replenishment of F.D.I.C. resources.    Q. What should regulators be doing?    A. If I had to cite a single theme, they should aim to preserve the stability of the financial system, not avoiding failures per se. The long-term health of the financial system requires that it be cleansed of excess capacity, and failures are part of the short-term price to be paid for a healthier system over the long term.

The music bustles with energy, brassy bombast, frenetic unison violin figurations and a piano part almost crazy with sweeping passage work, arm-blurring octaves, keyboard-spanning leaps and a haze of colors.

But last week the federalism revolution produced another, unaccustomed sound: cheers from advocates of medical marijuana, whose cause received a substantial boost when the court refused even to consider rescuing the federal policy of pursuing California doctors who advise their patients on using marijuana under the terms of the state's Compassionate Use Act.    The California law, adopted by voters in 1996, is part of a vigorous grass-roots revolt against the ''Reefer Madness'' message emanating from Washington, asserting that marijuana threatens the nation's very civic fabric. Of the nine Western states within the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, seven now authorize marijuana use with a doctor's approval. Having failed to deter the voters, it was the Clinton administration that first decided to go after the doctors.   Page Two: Oct. 12-18","excerpt":"Compassionate Conservatives on the High Court"},{"year":"1959","title":"VITTORIO DE SICA'S vast compassion for the poor people of Italy, manifested with overwhelming candor in such of his classic films as \\"The Bicycle Thief\\" and \\"Umberto D,\\" comes through again in his modest and wistful little drama, \\"The Roof\\" (\\"II Tetto\\"), which had its belated American première yesterday at the Trans-Lux Fifty-second Street.Belated, we say, because this picture, produced in Italy some three years ago, has been awaiting release in this country until such time as it could be arranged to get a sufficient theatre for it, in the light of its somewhat cheerless theme. And that only goes to show how cautious and insensitive some theatre people can be.For \\"The Roof\\" is essentially a happy and valorous little film, for all the evidence it gives of misfortune and material poverty. The young newlyweds, who are its principals, may be dismally and piteously poor and they may have to endure absurd discomforts and inconveniences before they get themselves a meager home. But the point is that they are courageous, they have spirit and they are in love. Out of these basic strengths, De Sica has composed a lovely little seriocomic film.If we seem to stress the word \\"little,\\" that is because the dramatic range, as well as the physical production and the human population, is small. This is simply the unpretentious story of how a young married couple tries to live, first in the crowded apartment of the husband's family, until a shattering quarrel occurs, and then temporarily separated, with the husband sleeping in a toolshed and the wife with a servant-girl friend. Finally, they summon their resources and their sympathetic and obliging pals and throw up a shack that will serve them as a private dwelling, all in the course of one night.The trick is to get the house finished before the police arrive, since the law is that people cannot be evicted from any house on which there is a roof. And this gives De Sica opportunity for a busy race against time, in which serious and poignant complications are deftly blended with comical twists.Lest credit be piled on De Sica, who merely directed and produced, let a share go to Cesare Zavattini, his favorite writer, who prepared the script. Brilliant bits of pictorial invention, such as people pausing in the middle of a dispute to cross themselves as a funeral passes or a quick shot of a homely girl's soaplathered face, aid the swift communication of penetrating ideas. And, combined with De Sica's sense of pathos, they make for a kind of poetry.More of same is in the performances of the two \\"unknowns,\\" Gabriella Pallotti and Giorgio Listuazi, who play the newlyweds. She is a lovely, sensitive youngster with a face as pure and warm as the sun, which reveals, in its clouded moments, the passage of difficult moods. And he is a tall, good-looking fellow with sudden aggressive attitudes that suggest the ambition and frustration of an honorable underprivileged youth.Gastone Renzelli is excellent as a quick-tempered brother-in-law and Maria Sittoro brings understanding to the role of the mother of the lad. Several others give shape to credible characters in De Sica's famous neo-realist style, which makes \\"The Roof\\" a believable, as well as a deeply touching film.There are English subtitles for the Italian dialogue.

Powerful images","excerpt":"compelling rhythms; a distinctive palette; phrases packed tight with meaning - Mr. Heaney has all the primary gifts of a poet, and they are gifts put at the service of a constant meditation on primary themes, on nature and history and moral choice.    The unmistakable landscape of much of his work is that of his native Ulster. As an Ulster Catholic, he feels the constant pressure of history, though it is a more complex history than partisan slogans generally allow. One of the finest poems in ''Station Island'' is a boyhood reminiscence of a Protestant neighbor coming over to deliver a Christmas present he has made, a toy battleship. The feel of his workshop is wonderfully evoked; so is the last glimpse of him riding away on his bicycle into the dusk. And if they were to meet now, the poet says, they would no doubt begin and end ''in a speech all toys and carpentry'' -    A doorstep courtesy to shun Your father's uniform and gun,   but ''Maybe none the worse for that.'' The poem is called ''An Ulster Twilight,'' and the implication is that a good deal of life in Ulster takes place in a twilight zone.

Q. What's it like for Palm watching this long-running legal drama involving R.I.M.?    A. The one thing that we can continue to be focused on is competing in the marketplace, and certainly this may bring some uncertainty to R.I.M.'s customers and they may be more interested in looking at some of our solutions. But I don't think -- my sense is that ultimately it will be resolved between the parties and I think the idea that the BlackBerry service will be discontinued is extremely unlikely.    Q. There is a perception out there that a recent court ruling, which refused to impose a settlement between R.I.M. and the patent holding company, NTP, is good news for you. Your stock went up on the news and a lot of people see this as an opportunity for Palm to grab even more market share of corporate customers.    A.

It has been interesting to watch Radiohead's live concerts evolve from manic twitching affairs to symphonies of stillness. This eight-song album captures the latter, mostly with songs from the band's previous two recordings. Just as a concert can sometimes open up a band's album and make it more accessible, this live album strips away the production and studio effects to reveal the songs lurking behind some of the soundscapes on these albums. It also features a live acoustic version of an unreleased favorite, ''True Love Waits.'' Despite its relatively short length, this album actually works as an addition to the evolving oeuvre of this band, and is just as intense a listening experience as some of its previous albums, especially when paired with the bootleg of the band performing acoustic versions of their songs.
