Remarks by the Kuwaiti, Iraqi and Chinese representatives were transcribed as they were read by United Nations translators. James A. Baker 3d: Secretary of State    I would like to begin today's discussion with a quotation that I think aptly sets the context for our discussions today. The quotation is as follows:   \\"There is no precedent for a people being the victim of such injustice and of being at present threatened by abandonment to an aggressor. Also, there has never before been an example of any government proceeding with the systematic extermination of a nation by barbarous means in violation of the most solemn promises made to all the nations of the earth, that there should be no resort to a war of conquest and that there should not be used against innocent human beings terrible poison and harmful gases.\\"    Those words, I think, could well have come from the Emir of Kuwait, but they do not. They were spoken instead in 1936, not in 1990","excerpt":"they come from Haile Selassie, the leader of Ethiopia, a man who saw his country conquered and occupied much like Kuwait has been brutalized since Aug. 2.    Sadly, colleagues, that appeal to the League of Nations fell ultimately upon deaf ears. The League's efforts to redress aggression failed and international disorder and war ensued. History has now given us another chance. With the cold war behind us, we now have the chance to build a world which was envisioned by the founders of this organization, by the founders of the United Nations.   We have the chance to make this Security Council and this United Nations true instruments for peace and for justice across the globe. We must not let the United Nations go the way of the League of Nations. We must fulfill our common vision of a peaceful and just post-cold-war world.   But if we are to do so, we must meet the threat to international peace created by Saddam Hussein's aggression. And that is why the debate that we are about to begin will, I think, rank as one of the most important in the history of the United Nations. It will surely do much to determine the future of this body.    Our aim today must be to convince Saddam Hussein that the just and humane demands of this Council, and of the international community, cannot be ignored. If Iraq does not reverse its course peacefully, then other necessary measures, including the use of force, should be authorized. We must put the choice to Saddam Hussein, in unmistakable terms. Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber: Foreign Minister of Kuwait    It is true that Kuwait is a tiny state in terms of its size and population. But thanks to this massive and overwhelming international support, which is being rendered by you on the basis that justice is a true shield of peace now, we find that Kuwait is indeed a power that carries significant weight.    After all these efforts and all these resolutions and that time which is measured by my people in minutes as they continue to bleed profusely, no one really can now claim that the international community has not given to Iraq full opportunity to comply with the international will or for that matter that the world community has not offered good feasible grounds for a peaceful settlement and the elimination of the prospects for war and saving the region a real holocaust the consequences of which no one perhaps can predict except God the Almighty.   Nor can anyone really claim that the international community did not pay due attention to any forthcoming signals or really meaningful Iraqi initiatives in response to the Security Council resolutions. Channels of communication with the Iraqi regime are full of good prospects for achieving a just peaceful settlement.   Indeed there are many formulae and avenues that can indeed lead to peace. But the intransigence of the Iraqi regime is the real reason that is pushing the region at this point to a conflagration that we do not want to see. . . .    Mr. President, the Iraqi regime has sought to deflect attention from its crime against world peace by invoking issues that have nothing to do with its aggression against Kuwait, like citing the danger of the foreign presence in the region. Iraq is the first to know that it is the real reason for that presence.   It cited the question of hostages in order to create a humanitarian issue without paying due attention to their dignity. Indeed, it dragged them into its adventurous schemes in a desperate attempt to create a link between its aggression against Kuwait and its occupation and the expulsion of its people and the question of Palestine which is, alas, the first victim of its aggression.   It continues to exploit it for a cheap propaganda ploy. It calls for an Arab solution which it is the first to dissent from and reject later and then utilize that following sowing the seeds of dissention into Arab ranks.    Crude exploitation of these questions exposed the tactics of the Iraqi regime to gain time and to cause divisiveness and playing on emotions and sentiments. But the Arab world, the Islamic world and the international community found out the truth, defined the road, set the goals and demonstrated firm unity and resolve. And this is represented, Mr. President, in the draft resolution now before the Council. Abdul Amir al-Anbari: Iraqi U.N. Representative    Mr. President, Iraq calls for peace. It desires peace not for us alone but for the entire Middle East region. Iraq advocates such a peace, we desire such a peace on the basis of the implementation of all Security Council resolutions in a just manner and in keeping with one standard based on justice and fairness.   Iraq has embodied this approach in the initiative declared by Mr. Saddam Hussein, the President of Iraq, on the 12th of August. He proposed an integrated and comprehensive manner for dealing with all the problems of the Middle East through the Security Council and on the basis of international law so as to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of all parties so that the peoples of the region may enjoy peace, stability, prosperity now and in the future. The American Administration has rejected this initiative before even examining it. It has imposed its refusal upon others. The problems of the Middle East are not isolated one from the other. It has common historic roots. What is tangible is of that one problem is often the cause for the eruption of other problems. It could also be the result of the vestiges of a chronic problem that remains without solution. Therefore the linkage between problems is a natural and logical method. Any separation is artificial. It disregards the organic link, the historic link and the political link between these problems.    The American refusal of this reality is prompted by suspicious motivation that has no link with the interests of the people of the Middle East. It is a premeditated policy to impose domination on the fate of a region for purely imperialist designs. It is indeed an exercise in politial hypocrisy that the American position embodies a contrary or opposite linkage with the problems of the Middle East since they call for separation at the same time they try always at procrastination to avoid the resolution of the Palestinian problem in spite of the fact that Palestinian blood is shed every day as well as the continuation unimpeded of Israeli crimes. Is this because we are Arabs? Is this because the problems of the Middle East cannot be resolved by one standard, the standard of international law and the charter, which the United States alleges to espouse?    The question which must be raised now is the following -- will the Security Council rise to the level of responsibility for imposing a just and lasting peace through an integrated approach to dealing with all the problems of the region? The response to this question constitutes your historic mission. On our part, we are continuing on our road. Peace is our goal. We work for it. We desire it. If war is imposed upon us by the United States, this will be our destiny. I wish to reaffirm to you that our people will not kneel. We will rise to the level of responsibility because we are calling for a right. We are defending this right against injustice and tyranny. Qian Qichen: Foreign Minister of China    Through my visits, I feel deeply that members of the international community share common grounds on the gulf crisis on two points -- namely, they all oppose the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait, and call on Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait immediately. While at the same time, they all wish to see that the gulf crisis be settled through a peaceful means. Today, when the Foreign Ministers of member states of the Security Council are meeting here once again, I believe that such common grounds are also shared by us.    Mr. President, the United Nations, as the international organization for the maintenance of peace and security, is responsible both to international security and to history. It should act with great caution and avoid taking hasty actions on such a major question as authorizing the member states to take military actions against another member state.   The reason why China has voted in favor of the previously adopted 10 relevant resolutions is that though the sanctions measures, as stipulated in those resolutions, are severe, they fall out of the domain of the use of force.    However, in this draft resolution about to be adopted, the wording \\"use all necessary means\\" is used, which in essence permits the use of military actions. This runs counter to the consistent position of the Chinese Government -- namely, to try our utmost to seek a peaceful solution. Therefore, the Chinese delegation has difficulty voting in favor of this draft resolution.    On the other hand, the gulf crisis arises as a result of the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait, and Iraq has thus far not taken any practical steps on the key question of troop withdrawal from Kuwait. In this connection, we have noted that this draft resolution has called on Iraq to fully comply with Security Council Resolution 660, and the subsequent relevant resolutions urging Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait immediately. Since China is in favor of this position, China will not cast its veto on this draft resolution either.    Mr. President, the Chinese Government still hopes the international community should maintain and strengthen its political, diplomatic and economic pressure on Iraq. As long as there is a gleam of hope for peace, efforts should be continued toward this end.   The Chinese Government wishes to once again urge Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait immediately, and Kuwait's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and legitimate Government should be restored. The Chinese Government once again calls on the international community to use all possible opportunities and ways and means and continue to try its best for a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis.

Park Slope Patisserie    Dukens Daniel, a Haitian lawyer, immigrated to Brooklyn 26 years ago and wound up baking instead of practicing law. He baked first at Ebinger's and then, after that company went out of business in the early 1970's, he baked for 19 years at William Greenberg Jr. Desserts in Manhattan.   He opened his own bakery, Patisserie Daniel, at 388 Seventh Avenue (11th Street) in Park Slope, Brooklyn, two years ago. \\"I waited until I could afford to buy a building because I did not want to have to depend on the whims of a landlord,\\" Mr. Daniel said.   The years spent at Greenberg's have left an indelible mark on Mr. Daniel's baking.

Her finely wrought hand-dipped bittersweet chocolates come with lush, creamy ganache fillings flavored not only with the typical vanilla, mocha, hazelnuts and raspberries, but also with mint, an infusion of Earl Grey tea and an exotic mixture of fragrant spices.    The chocolates, which are served in the restaurant, can be ordered by mail. A 10-piece 3.75-ounce sampler of Chocolats le Francais is $9; 21 pieces are $16.75; a 45-piece assortment, about a pound, is $33. Postage is extra. Telephone: (708) 541-7470. Chefs on Skis    There will be nearly 500 skiers in toques schussing the slopes in Windham, N.Y., on Sunday, to start this year's round of five regional competitions for the annual Chefs Ski Race. What began with two dozen chefs in 1975 has now grown into an international competition that now boasts the sponsorship of Grand Marnier and raises money through entry fees to benefit charities, among them City Harvest, City Meals-on-Wheels and several food banks.   It's a serious amateur ski competition enlivened by the skiers' decorated chefs jackets. The series of races begins at 9 A.M. and continues until 3:30 P.M. at Ski Windham, off Exit 21 of the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway. Information: (518) 734-4300. Fewer New Products    Shoppers may not have noticed, but this past year there were 10.6 percent fewer new food products (including old products in new sizes, styles or flavors) introduced onto the market than in 1990, a year that set a record for new product introductions, according to a study released by Marketing Intelligence Service, a market research firm in Naples, N.Y.   There was an overall decline of 3 percent in the number of new retail packaged products (including nonfood items), according to the study. Still, some individual categories like beverages and pet products did show increases.    The service also reported that one-third of these new products claimed some kind of nutritional benefit, relating to the quantities of salt, cholesterol, fat, calories, fiber or sugar. And a record 13 percent of the new products advertised some kind of environmental benefit.   The market research company expects the trend toward fewer new products to continue in 1992. \\"More restrictive labeling regulations are likely to dampen, rather than accelerate, new foods and beverages that have thrived in recent years on a freewheeling climate for nutritional claims,\\" said Richard Lawrence, president of Marketing Intelligence Service.  NEW FOODS WITH A TASTE OF PROVENCE    IT'S a first at Pierre Deux. The chain of French country home-furnishings shops has just introduced a collection of food products.   They bear the label of Baumaniere, the name of the elegant restaurant and inn in Les Baux de Provence. They were introduced in France last year, and in America are only available at the Pierre Deux retail shops.   They are infused with the herbaceous aromas and flavors of the south of France. Honeys, mustards, vinegars, spice mixtures and even nougats are given unusual tastes like lavender or thyme. The products include traditional candies from Aix-en-Provence and some expensive but excellent blended coffees.   Prices range from $5.50 for jars of mustard to $43 for calissons d'Aix, traditional glazed candies layered with glace fruit and almonds. The products are sold at the Pierre Deux shop at 870 Madison Avenue (70th Street) and 12 others around the country. They can also be ordered by calling (800) 874-3773.

It's also unusual in that the original film is not the sort of proven, marketable commodity that generally inspires (if that's the word) the urge to remake: ''Fingers'' was a box-office flop in the United States, and although it attracted some critical enthusiasm in France, it quickly, Mr. Audiard says, ''fell into a kind of purgatory'' -- largely forgotten and rarely revived.

Last year the prototype of Hadid's Aqua Table for Established & Sons fetched a dizzying $296,000 at auction, which may be chump change when Hadid presents her first full line of furniture, which will also be made by Established & Sons, next month. The collection is called Seamless, but it's a word that could just as easily refer to the relationship between Hadid and the Phillips de Pury & Company auction house, which is not only showing and selling the limited-edition work but also commissioned it in the first place -- casting itself in the role of agent as well. The Seamless exhibition, from Nov. 27 to Dec. 15 at Phillips's Chelsea headquarters, represents the most ambitious example yet of its recent foray into this new hybrid form: events that the auction house likens to art-market coming-out parties or mini-retrospectives. Until now it has featured a mix of exclusive albeit existing work by artists like Ron Arad, Ettore Sottsass, Mario Testino and Rolf Sachs. ''This is part of a very thought-out and concerted effort to offer more services to our clients,'' Alexander Payne, Phillips's director of design, says, referring to the insatiable collectors of contemporary art and design whom the house has been cultivating for more than a decade. The Seamless collection promises to take full-scale advantage of Phillips's massive gallery space while indulging in the fast-and-fluid curves that characterize Hadid's buildings. A super-high-gloss chair, shelf system, cabinet, lounger and stool will each be available in editions of 8 to 12 and carry price tags that will no doubt reflect Hadid's starchitect status. ''She's at the forefront of her architecture career,'' Payne says. ''But if one looks at her furniture output, this is really the beginning of her game.'' After the sale, Established & Sons will likely work with Hadid on future projects, but Phillips will shift its focus to expanding into yet another business role: that of an agency. It plans to announce an initial roster of artists and designers early next year.

QUIET DISTURBING TO MEN AT FRONT","excerpt":"They Couldn't Sleep When Guns Stopped -- The Marines and Chinese Exchange Dead"},{"year":"1939","title":"ALTHOUGH twenty out of twenty-six British studios have now been taken over or earmarked by the government for storing things and there are few signs yet of any vigorous renascence in the remaining six, the last weeks have shown a certain easing of tone in the film trade here. More and more firms, evacuated in the first days of war, have returned to town. The old faces and the old rumors are back in Wardour Street—three days a week, anyway. The old advertising inserts—the gold and silver ones, that come off on your fingers—are reappearing in the trade papers. Here and there you meet a film man who is actually optimistic about something. Soon, if this upward tendency goes on, we may even meet one who has reason to be.Except for the absence of neon lighting after dusk, a marked shortage of posters and a final hour clipped from their running time, the 4,000-odd cinemas in the country and Greater London are now open for business as usual. Box-office receipts vary according to pictures shown, as they did in seasons that had no political alibi, but on the whole a 10 per cent drop all round is the worst that can be recorded in takings.\\"Beau Geste\\" and \\"The Spy in Black\\" (\\"U-Boat 29\\") share the top honors of the Fall releases between them. Most doubtful booking is probably \\"The Mikado,\\" which did well enough in polite operatic districts but bounced badly in certain others. Our own kitchen observer, a keen film critic, refers to it as \\"that fool of a Chinese thing,\\" although she gives full marks to the \\"pretty music.\\" The Jones Family in the same program, she adds, were \\"all right.\\"West-end theatres, even with the new \\"staggered\\" closing hours, are apt to be wall down on their peacetime takings, but here again a good film here and there has held its own against the blackout. \\"Only Angels Have Wings,\\" \\"Nurse Edith Cavell\\" and \\"Stanley and Livingstone\\" are notable holdovers. \\"French Without Tears\\" took $10,000 in its first week at the Plaza—almost pre-war boom figures for this theatre. Paramount, who own it, were so moved by the film's reception that they devoted a double spread in a trade paper to the portraits of all the critics who praised it. True, there is no Robert Taylor or Hedy Lamarr among our number, but you'd be surprised at the distinguished and youthful group we make.It is too early yet to do more than guess at a bright career for Alexander Koala's secret film of the British Air Force, \\"The Lion Has Wings,\\" which went into the Leicester Square yesterday evening. This picture, made at Denham during the first twelve days of war, has excited more speculation in the press than any British film since Mr. Korda's spectacularly hush-hush \\"Things to Come.\\" It was placed under the Official Secrets Act during production. No stills were taken and no publicity issued. Journalists were gently edged away from that part of the lot where a wing-tip showed beyond the car park and young men in flying kit were seen to muster. Actors in pilots' uniforms ostentatiously ignored the press. Directors passed by with fingers on their lips. Miss Oberon in nurse's uniform simply wasn't there","excerpt":"they couldn't think what she would be doing in the studio—visiting her husband maybe.The film, it gradually transpired, was made with the full cooperation of the Air Ministry and with an Air Force Squadron Leader as technical adviser, but with Mr. Korda's own money. Many of the twenty-six actors played their parts while waiting to join their various service units. The normal pay was $25 a day. Ralph Richardson and Merle Oberon gave their services, Mr. Richardson coming back to finish the film in forty-eight hours of Navy leave.\\"The Lion Has Wings\\" turns out to be a typical Korda innovation. Not quite documentary, not quite newsreel, not quite adventure tale, it combines all three in an hour of vivid journalistic cinema. There is no fictional story, but studio actors reproduce, somewhat on March of Time lines, the close-ups of the argument. Ralph Richardson, for example, is an Air Force officer, Miss Oberon just A Wife, any one of millions. The opening section brushes in the background of English life before the war, gradually points up, contrast for contrast, the growing shadow of the swastika—Hitler among his people; King George among his people; Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, Memel, Poland—and the war is on us.We live over again the Sunday morning of Sept. 3, the Prime Minister's broadcast, that first air-raid warning that ended the old order. We see the silver balloon barrage over London. We are shown a hint of the staff-work behind the defense machine. Then comes the high spot of the film—a reconstruction of the Kiel Canal raid, from information supplied by the actual flyers, who are seen taking off and returning to the air field. \\"A celluloid fairy tale\\" is how the Nazi radio described this sequence.The film ends with an account of a possible night bombing raid on Britain, repulsed by R. A. F. fighters and reported step by step to the key-men at secret headquarters. Taking it by and large, we feel that Mr. Korda has got something in \\"The Lion Has Wings\\" that this country's propaganda can very well do with. As a nation we find it hard to roar, but this time we have opened our mouths and let out a good one.The producer in a foreword \\"expresses his gratitude for the cooperation which he received from the cast, production personnel, newsreel companies, the G. P. O. and other documentary film units.\\"In the meantime, the Post Office boys have come out with a nice little documentary of their own on the outbreak of war, which they call \\"The First Days,\\" and which happened in this way:Over that crucial week-end of Sept. 3 the G. P. O. units were standing by, on a hint, quite informal, from the government that it might be a wise thing to make a film record from the beginning, \\"should anything happen.\\" On chance, kicking their heels around in Whitehall and Westminster, they shot every likely thing they saw in the streets that Sunday morning. They shot people going into church, motorists packing week-end hampers into rumble seats, girls and boys setting off on cycles for a day's outing, nursemaids pushing babies in the parks. One bright lad even trained his camera on the face of Big Ben as the hands stood at 11:15 A. M.They were on the spot when the first newspaper bill in Whitehall announced a state of war, when the first air-raid warning sounded and Londoners for the first time trooped down into the official shelters.It was while they were sorting the shots for what they call \\"library stuff\\" a few days later that the heads of the unit realized they had all the bones of a picture ready—a picture that could be done at once, a picture that could give a true impression of London's change from peace to war to neutral countries and the provinces. They jotted down ideas. Gradually the film began to take shape. Cavalcanti, the unit chief, turned all his directors onto the job of collecting material. It was a communal effort. Everybody \\"mucked in.\\" Everybody shot and everybody cut. The result is \\"The First Days,\\" not, the unit insists, a propaganda film in any sense, just a faithful and sincere understatement of those first amazing days of war and what London did in them.

In this review (and in Mr. Masson's writings) the theory of psychoanalysis is described as a \\"religion,\\" the organized profession of psychoanalysis as a \\"church\\" and psychoanalysts themselves as demonstrating the arrogance and hostility to free thinking typical of true believers. Accordingly, Ms. Tavris states that there is an \\"unbridgeable chasm\\" between \\"believers\\" and \\"nonbelievers\\" in the psychoanalytic world view, and that Mr. Masson's criticisms of Freud are intolerable to a profession that \\"worships its founding father.\\"   These stereotypes are, painfully, not infrequently deserved. However, as a practitioner and analysand, I am compelled to state that they have nothing to do with psychoanalysis as I know it, from both sides of the couch. Furthermore, neither I nor any of my close colleagues have been disturbed by Mr. Masson's writings. Why? I suppose Mr. Masson, with no sense of the irony involved, would accuse us of denying or repressing the truth.   I find the whole dreary story of Mr. Masson's encounters with the psychoanalytic hierarchy to be uninteresting. It is yet one more rebel-versus-establishment scenario: they need each other, cannot survive without each other, are equally self-absorbed and hostile to inquiry","excerpt":"they deserve each other. As to his reading of the psychoanalytic literature, I find conspicuously absent the \\"intellectually demanding\\" assets Ms. Tavris claims for Mr. Masson. Both reviewer and author seem ignorant of mainstream psychoanalytic practitioners who have studied, to our great benefit, the    interaction    of unconscious processes and environmental trauma or abuse in the development of the individual.   The essence of psychoanalysis is the committed search for truth by both participants in the analytic dyad. Nothing could be more certain to produce profound emotional upheaval and potential for growth, and nothing could be more antithetical to doctrinaire thinking. JAMES STOERI  New York 'Final Analysis'"},{"year":"2005","title":"The evergreen offense of the Colts remains a wonder. Peyton Manning has started all 112 of his pro games and has averaged 263 passing yards a game. Last season, he set an N.F.L. record with 49 touchdown passes. Marvin Harrison is still a gamebreaking receiver, wideout Brandon Stokley is ready after missing the preseason because of a shoulder injury, and the offensive line is top grade. The Ravens will counter with their usual stifling defense, led by Ray Lewis at middle linebacker and Ed Reed at safety. Newcomers like cornerback Samari Rolle and outside linebacker Tommy Polley should help. When the Ravens have the ball, they are far less impressive. They are trying everything to make Kyle Boller a good quarterback","excerpt":"they designated Jim Fassel as the offensive coordinator and brought in Rick Neuheisel, the former University of Washington coach, to all but baby-sit for Boller. If that doesn't work, Jamal Lewis will have to do even more heavy-duty running. The Colts' defense, despite Dwight Freeney's dominance up front, wins no prizes and is hardly healthy. Corey Simon, a late pickup at defensive tackle, may help considerably, but not yet. Ravens Coach Brian Billick said, ''We're a better team than we were last year.'' Maybe so, but the Colts seem on a higher level. Reporter's pick: Colts    Indianapolis Colts (12-4) at Baltimore Ravens (9-7)  8:30 p.m. today, ESPN    Philadelphia Eagles (13-3) at Atlanta Falcons ( 11-5)  9 p.m. tomorrow, ABC    The Eagles have problems. Terrell Owens, the gifted but unpredictable receiver, feuded with quarterback Donovan McNabb. Brian Westbrook, the all-purpose running back, is unhappy with his contract. Corey Simon, a reliable defensive tackle, was discarded when he refused to sign a salary tender. Good wide receivers are scarce. Still, there should be enough there against a Falcons team that is always a contender as long as quarterback Michael Vick is there.   Eagles    Seattle Seahawks (9-7) at Jacksonville Jaguars (9-7)  1 p.m. today    The Jaguars are getting an offensive overhaul. Their new coordinator, Carl Smith, has a strong-armed quarterback in Byron Leftwich and receivers who can go deep in Jimmy Smith and Reggie Williams. Maybe that will put punch into a dull offense. The Seahawks could be vulnerable because they have seven new starters on defense, including an all-new secondary. At least now they have defensive help to complement Matt Hasselbeck's passing.   Jaguars    New Orleans Saints (8-8) at Carolina Panthers (7-9)  1 p.m. today    With their home city and their home stadium battered, the Saints begin a vagabond season against a team with high potential. The Panthers' defense, with Julius Peppers and Brentson Buckner up front and Ken Lucas and Chris Gamble at cornerback, is tough, and Jake Delhomme is an inspirational quarterback. The Saints have a pounding runner in Deuce McAllister, but their defense gave up the most yards in the league last year and does not look much better.   Panthers    Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-11) at Minnesota Vikings (8-8)  1 p.m. today    The Vikings' passing game, in the trusty care of quarterback Daunte Culpepper, will thrive despite the departure of Randy Moss. Meanwhile, the defense, so vulnerable to the run, has been beefed up. The Buccaneers will rely on quarterback Brian Griese, who hardly set the league afire with Denver and Miami, but seems at home in Jon Gruden's West Coast offense. Over all, the Bucs are not the Super Bowl team of three years ago.   Vikings    Jets (10-6) At Kansas City Chiefs (7-9)  1 p.m. today    The Jets are sounder, especially if quarterback Chad Pennington is fully recovered from shoulder surgery, and he seems to be. The Chiefs will pass all day because they need the usual high scoring from their offense.   Jets    Houston Texans (7-9) at Buffalo Bills (9-7)  1 p.m. today    Quarterback J.P. Losman of the Bills, a rookie understudy last year, will make his first start, so his defense must carry the load. It did last season, when the Bills almost made the playoffs, and should repeat this week in limiting David Carr.   Bills    Cincinnati Bengals (8-8) At Cleveland Browns (4-12)  1 p.m. today    The Bengals have come a long way and are still improving. The Browns, with a new coach, Romeo Crennel, must try to dig out with Trent Dilfer at quarterback. Cleveland's almost new secondary may have its hands full against Carson Palmer.   Bengals    Denver Broncos (10-6) at Miami Dolphins (4-12)  1 p.m. today    Nick Saban, the Dolphins' new coach, will discover that his team has a long way to go. Quarterback Gus Frerotte will remind no one of Dan Marino. Jake Plummer of the Broncos is good, last season's 20 interceptions notwithstanding.   Broncos    Tennessee Titans (5-11) at Pittsburgh Steelers (15-1)  1 p.m. today    Of the Steelers' battering runners, Jerome Bettis (calf) is out and Duce Staley (knee) is questionable. Coach Bill Cowher said, ''The biggest concern I have is making sure we understand that we aren't going to pick up where we left off.''   Steelers    Chicago Bears (5-11) at Washington Redskins (6-10)  4 p.m. today    The Bears, with a typical quarterback shortage, will start the rookie Kyle Orton, and he should benefit from an experienced receiver in the newcomer Muhsin Muhammad. The Redskins counter with the undistinguished but mildly experienced Patrick Ramsey.   Redskins    Arizona Cardinals (6-10) at Giants (6-10)  4:15 p.m. today    Last season, the rookie Eli Manning unseated Kurt Warner as the Giants' quarterback. Now Warner returns to face Manning, who has a sore right elbow. The Cardinals have had only one winning season since moving from St. Louis in 1988.   Giants    Green Bay Packers (10-6) at Detroit Lions (6-10)  4:15 p.m. today    This is not a great Packers team, but it does have Brett Favre, sore ankle and all, starting his 15th season at quarterback. With Jeff Garcia (ankle) out for half the season, the Lions are down to two somewhat healthy quarterbacks.   Packers    Dallas Cowboys (6-10) at San Diego Chargers (12-4)  4:15 p.m. today    With Drew Brees passing and LaDainian Tomlinson running, the Chargers are potent. Rams Coach Mike Martz calls them ''probably as good as any team in the league on offense.'' The Cowboys unveil Drew Bledsoe at quarterback and a 3-4 defense.   Chargers    St. Louis Rams (8-8) at San Francisco 49ers (2-14)  4:15 p.m. today    A younger, less-battered Steven Jackson has replaced Marshall Faulk as the Rams' top runner. That should make little difference today; the 49ers are still poor despite an upgraded defense. That defense will have to bail out an erratic West Coast offense.

Despite extensive damage to a number of buildings, officials expect financial markets to open Monday and to operate at nearly normal levels.    The bomb killed one person, wounded 44 others and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage when it went off in a parked truck in the heart of the City, as the financial district is known. Two Taxis Hijacked    Although the Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility, its statement early today made no mention of two smaller bombs in London late Saturday night","excerpt":"they destroyed two taxicabs but caused no injuries.    The police said men with Irish accents tried to force the drivers of two cabs to drive them to their targets -- Prime Minister John Major's official residence at 10 Downing Street and Scotland Yard's headquarters -- but leaped out when the cabs were still far from their destinations. Both drivers fled before the bombs, which had been left in their cabs, went off.   If the bombings provoked one general reaction among the public, it was a sense that the Government and the police must step up their efforts against the I.R.A., which is waging a terrorist campaign to end British rule of Northern Ireland.   \\"We are not getting results,\\" said David Mellor, a former member of Mr. Major's Cabinet. \\"The terrorists have ripped the heart out of the City of London, putting at risk lives, livelihoods and indeed the position of the City,\\" he told the Press Association, a British news agency.  The Hunt for Clues    The explosion in the financial district left a 15-foot-wide crater in the street, shattered windows in dozens of buildings and sent shards raining down over several square blocks. Today the police continued a painstaking search for clues among the debris as officials sought to help banks, brokerage houses and other companies minimize the impact on their business.   \\"The Prime Minister and I agreed that the best way to frustrate the terrorists is to have the City back at work tomorrow, and we are working hard to insure that it is,\\" said Sir Francis McWilliams, the Lord Mayor.   Thousands of workers will be unable to enter offices in the buildings that took the brunt of the blast, including the 52-story National Westminster Bank tower, which lost most of its windows, and the headquarters of the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation, whose lobby was destroyed. Most companies said that they were arranging for other office space and that they did not expect any major disruption. Estimating Losses    Initial estimates of the damage ran as high as $1.5 billion. But the Association of British Insurers said these estimates could prove highly inaccurate. The group noted that the initial assessment from a bomb explosion in the City a year ago, which caused extensive damage to the Baltic Exchange and nearby offices, was also $1.5 billion; the cost of repairs proved to be less than a third of that.   Some of the cost is expected to be borne by insurance companies and by the Lloyds of London insurance market. But much may fall to the Government, which agreed earlier this year to serve as an insurer of last resort for the many building owners who were finding it impossible or too expensive to get coverage against terrorism.   It was the most powerful explosion in London since an I.R.A. bomb went off in the area on April 10, 1992.

This is from \\"A Neutral Corner: Boxing Essays\\" (North Point).    The kind of fighter the uninitiate relish is the fellow who will \\"take one to give one,\\" rushing in to occupy the other fellow's gloves with his face while he slugs away at the face in front of him. This is a type technically known as a \\"club fighter,\\" because such fighters provided the bread and butter of the small neighborhood fight clubs that flourished before television put them out of business. . . . It is the club fighter . . . who frequently suffers a rapid enfeeblement of the intellect. I once climbed into a taxi late at night on the Place Pigalle and soon discovered that the driver was Yves Laffineur, a former welterweight champion of France, who had had a brave manager in the late twenties and early thirties. The manager had put Laffineur in with all the good ones, including middles and light heavies. Laffineur's intelligence, Laffineur affirmed, had survived this festival of percussion -- but    tout juste.    \\"It escaped like the sole survivor of a shipwreck.\\" Why We Need Hard Times    Ann Haymond Zwinger, exploring a cave in the Southwest used for centuries by a prehistoric people, finds an unexpected message of hope in those distant lives. This is from \\"The Mysterious Lands,\\" (Truman Talley/Plume/New American Library, paper).    In wet times, with more fish and game, more grass, food was easier to come by. . . . When populations were small during good times, pre-archaic life was very good. But, during bad times of warmer and drier intervals, there was less fresh water, fewer grasses and more scrub, resources were sparser and more widely distributed, making them more difficult to gather and process.   When times were bad and populations were high, life was poor to desperate. But    these    were the times of innovation, invention, and change. Prehistoric people then increased the variety of plants and animals utilized, as well as made more intense use of what was already available","excerpt":"they developed newer and better means of processing and preparing food. Out of these periods of stress came innovation and advances in technology. . . . I, twentieth-century woman, sit here, nestled, in the silt of centuries, holding the minute thigh bone of a mouse, and find this thought incredibly reassuring. The Old Ways, Vanishing    Kermit Lynch identifies the virtues and laments the eclipse of traditional methods of French winemaking in this passage from \\"Adventures on the Wine Route: A Wine Buyer's Tour of France\\" (Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paper).    The taste of the grape told them when to harvest. The taste of the wine told them when to bottle, what sort of oak to employ, the appropriate barrel size, how to prune the different grape varieties, and on and on and on. The traditions varied from village to village depending on differences of grape variety, soil, and microclimate. The traditions that were in place at the beginning of the twentieth century were the result of centuries of trial and error. If the taste of a wine indicated that a steep, stony piece of land produced better wine, then that was the land they worked, regardless of the labor involved. . . . Do not think for a moment that they were ignorant people who did not know better. They seem to have been instinctively directed toward quality. Only in this century have we seen the hard-earned knowledge of the ancients discarded, almost overnight, in the name of progress. Thurber's Dreams    As young men E. B. White and James Thurber shared an office at The New Yorker. This is from a reminiscence written in 1961 and included in \\"E. B. White: Writings From The New Yorker 1925-1976\\" (HarperCollins).    The copy paper disappeared at a scandalous rate -- not because our production was high (although it was) but because Thurber used copy paper as the natural receptacle for discarded sorrows, immediate joys, stale dreams, golden prophecies, and messages of good cheer to the outside world and to fellow-workers. His mind was never at rest, and his pencil was connected to his mind by the best conductive tissue I have ever seen in action. The whole world knows what a funny man he was, but you had to sit next to him day after day to understand the extravagance of his clowning, the wildness and subtlety of his thinking, and the intensity of his interest in others and his sympathy for their dilemmas -- dilemmas that he instantly enlarged, put in focus, and made immortal, just as he enlarged and made immortal the strange goings on in the Ohio home of his boyhood. His waking dreams and his sleeping dreams commingled shamelessly and uproariously. Shall We Dance?    Behind the slender plots of the film musicals that paired Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Elizabeth Kendall argues, is an adroit allegory of love's power to alter the beloved. This is from \\"The Runaway Bride\\" (Knopf).   Astaire had the mannerisms of a theatrical juvenile of the twenties -- lightweight, ingratiating, a little goofy, a little nasty -- except when he danced. That's when he showed his \\"other\\" nature: the passionate lover. Rogers instinctively selected the Astaire she needed. In the course of a movie, she seemed to absorb and glow from the ardor of the dancing Astaire, while she mourned and resisted the flippancies of the nondancing Astaire. What happened in an Astaire-Rogers movie was a sleight-of-hand transformation: Rogers's longing for Astaire changed him, chastened him in the audience's eyes, and elevated him, even in his juvenile moments, to his noble dancing self.

As a study in reclaiming these orphans of soldiers and others, it holds one's attention, but from a story angle it is often rather tedious. It is something which if seen in Moscow would probably be more impressive than it is over here. Its actual narrative is nothing very different to what is occurring day in and day out in every country, except possibly that the criminals are younger. Fagin's little band in \\"Oliver Twist\\" stirred up as much, it not more, interest than the doings of these waifs.In many instances the scenes, like the story as a whole, strike one as being fairly well-drilled illustrations of what went on, but one has little or no feeling of suspense. It is one of those contradictory examples of film work, which is not strengthened by the use of the microphone, for one is inclined to think during the screening that the cinematic work is weakened by the desire to inject the spoken word. Yet there are some fine bits of photography, even though the sequences revealing the sleeping places of the wild children have an emphatically artificial aspect.There is a sort of Fagan and also a female in that line","excerpt":"they dictate the activities of the besprizorni. These youngsters are taught to work in very much the same way as pickpockets who follow some of the tent shows. They carry razor blades to cut the fur from an unsuspecting woman's coat and a minor theft may be a cover for something more important.Professor John Dewey, who is heard from the screen making an introductory talk, tells of the topic of the film, and, after declaring that there are no wild children in Russia today, he says that the picture is \\"an educational lesson of the power of freedom, sympathy, work and play to redeem the juvenile delinquent, a lesson which we, too, may learn.\\" He further explains that some of the youthful participants in the picture are not professional actors, but reclaimed wild children who once lived in a Collective, as the place where they were housed is called.Nikolai Batalof appears as the hopeful and patient Ogpu member who has faith in being able to make the wild boys interested in work. His presence is compelling, as is also that of a youthful member of the cast. Tsyvan Kyrla, who figures as Mustapha, the dominant personality among the waifs. It is he who is given money to buy food before the boys board the train for the Collective. The train starts, the puffing and snorting of the engine is heard and no Mustapha appears. There is nothing to prevent his running away, but before the last car leaves the station, the smiling Mustapha clambers aboard. He brings forth the food he has been sent to buy and for good measure, he shows Sergeyef, as the Ogpu member is named, a large sausage—which he has stolen.There are no guards in the Collective, but one after another the boys become fascinated by wielding hammers, sawing and cutting.An outstanding episode is that in which the spoons in the Collective are found to be missing. One of the urchins has stolen them and the inmates of the Collective, with their sole guardian. Sergeyef looking on smiling, are forced to lap up their hot soup and stick their mouths into their bowls of rice. Sergeyef has a spoon brought for himself and he proceeds to eat, laughing at the discomfort of the boys. That night the spoons are returned to their drawer!The number of the boys increases. A youngster whose mother dies as a result of an encounter with the wild boys first takes the place of the leader of the band of young thugs and eventually appears at the Collective. All does not run smoothly at the Collective, however, for through floods the inmates find themselves deprived of work and when Sergeyef leaves for Moscow, they become wild again, although they stay within bounds. There is an outburst in which they are bent on destruction, which is discouraging to the tactful Sergeyef, but onhis return he arouses enthusiasm by saying that they are going to build a railway.There follow scenes of the construction work and of a tragic ending for Mustapha, who had wanted to drive the first locomotive over the tracks.It is revealed in a Magistrate Court sequence that these youngsters always think of escaping from a reformatory ruled by guards. One of them is asked what he would like to have and he replies, \\"Vodka and girls.\\" This is said by the same smiling Mongolian. Mustapha, who proves to be the hero of the film.

A pretty face, if not a necessity, is an asset not to be despised. At the same time, no one seems quite sure how this works. What on television registers on our psyches, and what only passes us by? What, in fact, is television?    For one thing, it is not print. Old rules of journalism do not always apply. Newspapers do not exist without reporters; television needs nothing except itself. In the absence of someone to write for it, a newspaper is only blank newsprint or perhaps a shopper's guide. Television can get by with only its own technology and a subject on which to focus. The medium supersedes the correspondents who report the stories. They may be intelligent and informed, blessed with superior knowledge. Television makes them supporting actors in an ongoing drama, and so we know them by their styles.

Most immigrants, Hispanic and otherwise, are highly motivated to learn English, as those of us who teach them know.

But this only irritated Vladimir Yakovlev, the independent paper's editor.    \\"For two reasons,\\" he said recently, at Commersant's office in northwest Moscow. \\"It's a newspaper meant for high-ranking managers, and they are not the early-morning buyers. Also, it's not good for the staff","excerpt":"they don't feel the real market, which would buy more, or less, depending on the quality.\\"   The 31-year-old Mr. Yakovlev -- who managed to slow the sales pace by doubling the paper's issue price -- is not one of those Soviets who are befuddled by Western-style business principles. An entrepreneur with roots in the private-enterprise movement, he is an unabashed free-marketer, and so is his newspaper.   Commersant even takes its name from a pre-Revolutionary Russian business journal \\"to show that the history of a private economy here is much longer than the history of a socialist economy,\\" Mr. Yakovlev said.   Every week, about 350,000 Soviet citizens and foreigners across the country pick up the 16-page tabloid -- published, with a nod toward potential Western investors, in both Russian- and English-language.   Soviet readers pay 1 ruble (33 cents at official exchange rates) for an issue. The English-language edition, produced by the paper's two resident American journalists, costs $2 and is considered a bargain.   \\"It's a valuable resource, and a delight to read,\\" said Peter Lewis, a manager at the Moscow office of Ernst & Young, the accounting firm. Like other Western executives and lawyers posted here, he says he has come to rely on the paper's lively coverage of economics, politics, joint ventures, legal developments and other business-related news.   \\"What's great about Commersant is that it really has its finger on what's going on and is not frightened to print it,\\" Mr. Lewis said.   Indeed, in a country where it was once a crime to publish official statistics without state permission, Commersant capitalizes on glasnost to dig up useful data from all economic sectors, including the black market.   A monthly feature, \\"Commersant Consumer Basket,\\" tracks changes in the price and availability of 239 consumer goods -- everything from beef to blue jeans -- at official shops and black-market operations alike. (Last month, the column was entitled, \\"The Higher Cost of Barely Living.\\") And a recent currency article, \\"What the Ruble Is Really Worth,\\" concentrated on the fluctuations in black-market rates.   Commersant began with Mr. Yakovlev, who grew up in a newspaper family and went on to found Fact, the first private Soviet information service. (His father, Yegor Yakovlev, is the editor of Moscow News, an independent-minded news weekly with a circulation of about one million.)   But Commersant also has some strong American connections, forged a few years ago when Mr. Yakovlev met two American journalists: Craig Copetas, a Paris-based writer who was then Moscow correspondent for Regardie's, the Washington monthly; and Robert Manoff, who visited Moscow as head of the Center for War, Peace and the News Media at New York University.   The three men started discussing the idea of a business paper growing out of Fact. \\"But there's no question that Volodya was the person with the vision,\\" Mr. Copetas said, referring to Mr. Yakovlev by his Russian nickname. \\"Volodya is the energy behind this; he's an amazing guy.\\"   More tangible American support came from another of Mr. Copetas's friends, Thomas H. Dittmer, chairman of Refco Group Ltd., a Chicago-based futures and options trading house. In return for free advertising and a share of future profits, Refco donated word processors and other electronic equipment -- modest gear by American standards, but so valuable in Moscow that Commersant posts an armed guard at its office door. Refco also agreed to distribute the paper in the United States.   With financial backing from Fact, Mr. Yakovlev assembled an unusual Soviet newspaper staff -- young economic and political experts, no journalists -- and trained them by putting out \\"practice\\" issues for three months in late 1989. \\"It was the most awful period,\\" he said, shaking his head and smiling.   The writing is still a bit \\"bureaucratic,\\" though clearer than Pravda or Tass, said Brad Durham, Commersant's 27-year-old English-version editor. His co-worker, Michael Hetzer, who is 30 and a former business reporter at The Cary News in Cary, N.C., agreed. \\"The Russians would never use an anecdotal lead, and their use of quotes is sparse,\\" he said. Mr. Hetzer first visited Commersant to do interviews for a book on Soviet joint ventures -- and was invited to join the staff.    Using researchers and rough translations, the Durham-Hetzer team produces the highly readable English-language Commersant during a grueling 60-hour work marathon at the end of each week. Mr. Durham was hired away by Mr. Manoff of N.Y.U. from The World Paper, a Boston-based monthly.   Working for \\"Yak\\" is an experience, both journalists say. In some ways, their employer resembles a tough boss from America's industrial past. An error in the paper brings a dock in pay. Writers who hand in late copy are fined. \\"Fifteen rubles a minute, and there have been some huge fines paid,\\" Mr. Yakovlev admitted, with a grin.   Mr. Yakovlev also embraces some enlightened Western managerial techniques -- corporate \\"intrapraneurialism,\\" for example. Ask him how many people work at Commersant, and he shrugs. \\"There are only seven persons officially -- department heads,\\" he said. \\"They have budgets, and if they want to hire others, O.K.\\"   It seems to work. Commersant's average monthly sales come to 1.5 million rubles ($500,000 at official exchange rates), Mr. Yakovlev says, with after-tax profits of 500,000 rubles ($167,000) -- an astounding 33 percent profit margin. The paper has recently become what the Soviets call a joint-stock company, with Fact owning 51 percent and Mr. Yakovlev and others owning the rest.   Mr. Yakovlev is waiting for improved demographics before he begins soliticing much advertising. The Russian edition runs a few European ads for hard-currency goods and services. (A quarter page costs $1,440; a full page goes for $4,000). His yearly subscription rate is now 64 rubles, more than three times as expensive as the Moscow News weekly.   Commersant's demographics are already good in the United States, where 300 subscribers pay $265 each a year for the paper. \\"I get at least two phone calls a day about it,\\" said Peggy Yott, Refco's chief of worldwide communications.\\"People see it in the Soviet Union and then when they come back they want it.\\" The Paper That Covers the Soviet Union's Business Beat"},{"year":"1982","title":"Giddings & Lewis Inc., one of the nation's largest machine tools manufacturers, rejected today as ''inadequate'' a $260 million takeover offer by the American subsidiary of AMCA International Ltd. of Montreal and urged its shareholders to vote against the bid.

I LIKE THE IMPRINT OF LEAD DIRECTLY ON THE PAPER,'' Daniel Keleher says. ''You can feel the words on the page","excerpt":"they don't only look different, they    are    different.'' Keleher, who operates the Wild Carrot Letterpress in Hadley, Mass., specializes in printing handset, monotype and Linotype books for private presses. It is a demanding craft, and he often spends two months on the production of a book.  When he printed Dostoyevsky's ''The House of the Dead'' for the Limited Editions Club, he took a chance that had the artist, Fritz Eichenberg, holding his breath. Instead of printing Eichenberg's wood engravings from metal plates made from the blocks, Keleher, with the help of Bruce Chandler of the Heron Press in Boston, put the blocks themselves directly on the press. On his Heidelberg press, a traveling bed moves under the inked rollers. Keleher and Chandler laid the blocks on this bed and placed the sheets of paper on a cylinder that moves with the bed to receive the impression. They set the rollers high enough to just kiss the blocks and printed one sheet at a time. Each block was different, with varying depths, marks left from sanding and other peculiarities. To produce a coherent appearance in the book, the printers had to adjust the inking and impression for each block. It took them more than a week to print 2,000 copies of the eight wood engravings needed for the book.

THIRTY YEARS BEHIND; A Veteran Scenic Artist Calls for More Imagination in the Theatre"},{"year":"1990","title":"This year's budget agreement is good news for employers of low-wage workers: They'll pay even less for labor. The agreement calls for an increase in the earned income tax credit for families with children, an insurance credit and a young child credit -- all of which will increase the incomes of families of the working poor temporarily. But competition for jobs will enable employers to offer less and still obtain the quantity and quality of labor they want. \\n\\nIf workers were willing to work for a given wage before the credits, they will be equally willing to work for a lower wage plus the credit. You can't hide that from employers or the labor market. All this is known to economists as the \\"Speenhamland effect,\\" named after an attempt in southeastern England in the late 18th century to reduce poverty among the working poor by paying \\"supplements in aid of wages\\" out of tax revenues. \\n\\nThe policy wasn't applied widely, but its chief effect where and when it was applied was to pull money wages down. The United States in the late 20th century won't escape that result.\\n\\nThe downward pressure on wages for low-wage workers created by the Speenhamland effect will be reinforced by the recession and immigration. We will soon find that real wages for low-wage workers will be no higher than before the new credits, money wages will be lower and a subsidy to employers of low-wage workers will be paid by taxpayers.\\n\\nEmployers of low-wage labor will have even less incentive to invest in labor-saving technology or restructure their enterprises to increase productivity. Indeed, the incentive to substitute low-wage labor for capital will increase as the trade-off between labor and capital shifts to labor. \\n\\nWe can expect a decline in overall productivity in the low-wage sector of the economy. We can also expect the pauperized sector of the economy to be even more difficult to eradicate. We are tightening the knot that fastens that albatross around our neck.\\n\\nThe key to eliminating poverty is higher wages, not lower. Our national policy should be to increase the $3.80 minimum wage (horrors!) gradually and extend its coverage (more horrors!) until a worker employed at that wage is able to support a family of four at or above a realistic minimum level of health and decency. This will shift the trade-off between low-wage labor and capital in favor of capital and increased productivity -- exactly what the economy needs. \\n\\nSuch a shift may well be traumatic, but the trauma can be alleviated by training programs for workers, tax incentives for employers and programs to ease the transition. Much of this could be paid for by funds shifted from welfare, food stamps and wage supplement programs, as well as by income taxes paid out of the higher earnings the workers affected.\\n\\nAbove all, we have to stop thinking like that economist with the House Ways and Means Committee who was quoted after the budget deal as saying: \\"The working poor were made better off by this agreement than by any other piece of legislation passed in the 1980's.\\" Nonsense.

His honey-cured baritone is at home in honky-tonk songs about drinking away the pain of a breakup or getting through the morning after the binge.

He sounds appropriately mournful and rueful in songs of barroom self-pity, and his unaccompanied version of \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" captured the song's despondent longing.

The fun is good-natured, but just about as probable as the dropping of a leather pouch on a schooner's deck from an airplane a couple of thousand feet in the air, which incidentally happens in this tepid affair.Mr. Sidney strikes a certain vein of mirth and so does Mr. Murray. Vera Gordon figures as Mrs. Finklebaum. After observing the poodle that young Pat brought to Miss Finklebaum one sympathizes with Mrs. Finklebaum in her opposition to the Finklebaum-O'Brien match.

The story, about the first attempt to establish an English colony on this continent, is one of history's great mysteries. An exploratory party was welcomed in the Carolinas in 1584 by the Roanoak and Croatoan Indians, two of whom went to England with the explorers and returned the next year with 600 men organized by Sir Walter Raleigh, mostly soldiers, whose efforts to found a settlement ended in bitter hostility between them and the Indian tribes.   That group was succeeded in 1587 by a new party of 115 men, women and children led by John White, whose granddaughter, Virginia Dare, became the first English child born on this continent. Not only did these civilians inherit the distrust their predecessors had aroused among the Indians, but their crops also failed, forcing White to return to England for supplies. When he was finally able to get back to the colony in 1590, he found it abandoned. Its inhabitants disappeared from history.

And they lack the will because, unlike ordinary citizens, they do not sufficiently feel the threat of nuclear holocaust as a personal danger. Both leaderships embrace a nuclear strategy of assured destruction of the other's citizenry that leaves both leaderships intact to wage ''controlled and protracted nuclear war.'' Their ''plan for continuity of government'' is reflected in separate and profoundly unequal provisions for civil defense in both countries. Civil defense for ordinary American and Soviet citizens is a government charade inspired by conventional bombardments of past wars. But for hundreds, or even thousands, of American and Soviet leaders (''national command authorities,'' as they call themselves), civil defense is a high-priority and potentially real sanctuary (''survival of strategic command, control, and communications system'') that involves hollowed mountains, special aircraft and superhardened bunkers. No wonder leaders can authorize plans for the instant incineration and radiation of millions of people","excerpt":"they expect to be elsewhere.

THE SALT OF LIFE"},{"year":"1991","title":"When J. D. Salinger's unpublished letters from the 40's and 50's were deposited in the Harvard, Princeton and University of Texas libraries, no one could have foreseen that this donation would one day set the publishing world on its ear, drive writers to the barricades and upset the writers of computer codes. Doubtless, Holden Caulfield would have thought they had it coming to them.   Who could imagine that the whole business would become so tangled that a couple of Senators would have to find a cure?    It all started in 1983 when Ian Hamilton, literary critic at The Sunday Times of London, decided to do a book on the famously reclusive Mr. Salinger. He worked on \\"J.D. Salinger: A Writing Life\\" for the next three years. His labors brought him to the libraries and the unpublished letters Mr. Salinger had written to friends and associates between 1939 and 1961. Mr. Hamilton quoted from and paraphrased a number of them.   When Mr. Salinger saw the galley proofs, he told his lawyers to sue for copyright infringement. In 1987, the case was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York. Lawyers for Mr. Hamilton and Random House, his publisher, argued that the unauthorized use of the letters was legal under the longstanding doctrine of fair use. That doctrine enables reporters, teachers, critics and historians to quote excerpts of copyrighted material without obtaining permission.    The court found Mr. Hamilton and Random House guilty of copyright infringement, principally on the ground that the letters used were unpublished. What angered the writing world was the court's reasoning. \\"Unpublished works,\\" it said, \\"normally enjoy complete protection against copying.\\" Worse, the court repeated this Draconian formulation in 1989 in a case involving the unpublished letters and diaries of the Scientology guru L. Ron Hubbard. The Supreme Court allowed the Hubbard decision to stand.   Publishing houses, fearful of lawsuits, refused to accept those parts of manuscripts that quoted unpublished materials. Writers feared they were barred from using the unpublished materials that constitute the soul of probing, illuminating history","excerpt":"They faced the specter of the heir who refuses to grant permission for the use of unpublished materials that might cast the departed in an unfavorable light.   Senator Paul Simon and I stepped in and introduced legislation to amend the fair use section of the Copyright Act. A year ago, the House and Senate Judiciary Committees held joint hearings. Writers like Taylor Branch and J. Anthony Lukas explained how the Salinger and Hubbard cases could have a devastating impact on work like theirs.   We two Senators did not want to open the gates to the wholesale use of unpublished materials. When you or I write a letter, a memorandum or a manuscript, we have a right to our privacy and a right to decide if and when to publish. Besides, I thought the court was right in finding Mr. Salinger's copyright infringed; it erred only in the Draconian words it used to explain why.    The trickiest problem in crafting legislation was posed by writers of that most arcane language, computer software. Under copyright law, software is a literary work entitled to the full measure of copyright protection. The unpublished part of a computer program is its source code: the instructions a computer reads to learn what it is supposed to do; because a competitor can easily use a source code to make copycat programs, software makers rightly favored strict limits on the unauthorized use of such codes -- that is, strict limits on the use of unpublished materials.   After numerous meetings and microscopic analysis of legislative language, we found a formula that would lift the cloud over authors while safeguarding privacy, property rights and computer codes. The Simon-Leahy fair use bill was introduced in the Senate in May and reported out of the Judiciary Committee last month. Representative William J. Hughes, Democrat of New Jersey, has introduced a companion bill in the House. We look forward to swift passage in both houses this summer and a prompt signing by President Bush.   The whole episode suggests that a summertime rereading of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is in order.

No antique baskets dangle from the ceilings; no rag rugs are scattered on the floors. No matter.  The result is a comfortable environment. That harsh combination of antiseptic white walls, white tile floors, stainless-steel counter tops and commercial hardware that was de rigueur not so very long ago seems, at long last, to have become passe.     But while kitchen styles currently vary at the whim of the professionals who design them, a certain trend appears evident. ''Kitchens are beginning to look more residential again,'' says Jay Spectre, an interior designer.    Spectre isn't alone in his observation. Richard Gluckman, a partner in the firm Stelle-Gluckman Architects, believes the reason for the more home-style kitchen is a renewed interest in the natural materials that now can be seen in so much residential architecture. Stained wood, for instance, is often chosen for cabinets and floors instead of vinyl, linoleum or plastic laminate. Marble is a popular choice for counter tops. And hand-painted tiles, once used sparingly around stoves and sinks, are covering entire walls. The results are not meant to look old-fashioned; these kitchens are at once clean-lined and inviting.

Usually commissioned by the owner of a house after the premises had been redecorated, the watercolors were placed in albums to be handed around among friends and, in a few cases, passed down through generations like a family Bible.

E. M. Forster would have said it bothers me because I am a critic. In his ''Aspects of the Novel,'' the English writer observed about ''point of view'': ''Critics are more apt to object than readers. Zealous for the novel's eminence, they are a little too apt to look out for problems that shall be peculiar to it, and differentiate it from the drama","excerpt":"they feel it can be accepted as an independent art; and since the problem of point of view certainly is peculiar to the novel they have rather overstressed it.''   Perhaps so, but the problem still needs a little stressing, doesn't it? The reason I raise this hopelessly old- fashioned issue is that although it might be argued that anything goes when it comes to point of view in the modern novel - in Thomas Pynchon's dazzling ''Gravity's Rainbow,'' if I recall correctly, the omniscient narrator even follows the progress of a mouth harp through the sewers of Boston - there seems to me to be certain limits imposed by common sense.

But all he felt like doing was screaming.\\n\\nRather than shout, he started to draw a guy opening his mouth wide enough for a Mack truck to pass through and letting out a titanic scream. Little did Mr. Therrien know that this therapeutic alter ego with an ever-present scream would become a touchstone for people across the nation who felt like screaming about a whole host of things like traffic jams, political correctness or P.M.S. Nor did he know that he would wind up leaving his job as a mechanical engineer because his Screaming People would spawn a $500,000-a-year T-shirt and greeting-card business.\\n\\nAs he sat tucked in a booth at the Daily Caffe in New Haven where he has lived the last 12 years, Mr. Therrien sipped on an iced coffee and mulled over how his life had changed thanks to his art. \\"I'd painted all my life but I'd given it up for a while, so when I took it up again I just kept drawing this screaming man and other dark themes,\\" he said. \\"I showed a few to my mother and she got a little worried, but actually the painting was really helping me out in a tough time. It's hard to believe what's come of it.\\"\\n\\nPaul Bass, editor of The New Haven Advocate, which publishes a weekly Screaming Man cartoon, said it had appeal because \\"people are so outraged today","excerpt":"they feel the world is out of control and they want to just scream about so many things.\\"\\n\\nMr. Therrien's cartoons add a good deal of controversy to a paper that prides itself on muckraking. \\"We could write about problems in the mayor's office or about a corrupt politician and it still won't generate the letters that come in when Bob draws a nun,\\" Mr. Bass said.\\n\\nReligion, particularly Catholicism, political correctness and relationships gone wrong are all topics Mr. Therrien takes on. \\n\\nThere's the Screaming Vulnerable Man whose girlfriend says \\"We can still be friends\\" as she takes a mallet to his heart. There's Screaming Jesus on the Mount who says \\"The meek haven't got a prayer,\\" the Screaming Man on Caffeine who says \\"Coffee is my drug of choice\\" and Adam and Screaming Eve with Screaming Serpent where Adam says, \\"Sorry, Eve, I'm Gay!\\" \\n\\nHis ideas come fast and furious, from strolling the streets of New Haven and observing people, from news headlines, from his own life. Although the Screaming Man's name is Jake, quite a bit of Bob Therrien resides within. \\"Definitely,\\" said Mr. Therrien who is 37 years old. \\"I'm a cynic and I hope I never lose that.\\"\\nViolence Draws Criticism\\n\\n Although acrylic paints were always his medium, he does the Screaming Man in pen and ink on small drawing boards. He works in his Hamden studio and in his apartment, whenever the mood strikes. Some he finishes in 8 hours, others take 20 hours. \\n\\nHe has been criticized because beyond being irreverent, many of his works are violent, like the Screaming Woman Terminates a Relationship in which she shoots her significant other and screams \\"Codependent No More! Or, the Screaming Man Responds to Regis and Kathie Lee and shoots out his television set. (Regis showed the card once on the show and Mr. Therrien just about fell off the Stairmaster when he saw it, he said.)\\n\\n\\"People do get upset over the violence, but this is a cartoon, it's not real,\\" he said. \\"My biggest fear isn't over the right wing but over the left who will say I can't do my work because it's not always politically correct.\\"\\n\\nMr. Therrien said he has been painting \\"ever since I can remember.\\" His father was a carpenter who painted on the side, and art was encouraged in his home. A teacher took him under his wing and Mr. Therrien enrolled as an art major at a community college in Arizona, where his family lived for several years. \\n\\n\\"I flunked out,\\" he said, scuffing his black sneakers on the cafe floor.  He said he could not get into the school's clique of artists and, by then, he also had a serious drinking and drug problem so he stopped drawing. He started again after having spent time at a rehabilitation center.\\n\\nAt the time, he worked by day as a mechanical engineer at Norden Systems in Norwalk and moonlighted as a guitarist in his punk-rock group, the BadBob Band, which is also the name of his company and part of the signature on his cartoons. He painted his Screaming Man on sprawling canvases and one night hung them up at The Moon, a New Haven nightclub that has an artists' night every Monday when painters hang up their work, poets read their poems and musicians play. \\n\\n\\"People loved the paintings, but I had to charge $200 because at least $150 of materials went into them, and nobody had that kind of money,\\" Mr. Therrien said. \\"I wanted my art to be more accessible so I thought of T-shirts.\\" He and a partner started attending T-shirt manufacturing shows and stationery shows, and soon marketing representatives were selling his T-shirts and cards in gift shops, clothing stores and boutiques all over the nation. \\n\\n\\"I like having my work shown in a gallery but that's just in one corner of the world that a few hundred people are going to pass by,\\" Mr. Therrien said. \\"With the T-shirts, thousands of people wear them across the country so it's like having walking galleries everywhere. I still get such a great feeling when I see someone walking around New Haven in my T-shirt.\\"\\n\\nSandi Celico, the owner of Strings and Things on Block Island, said she could not stock enough of the T-shirts and always displayed them in her window. \\"At night people would gather in front of the window and just chuckle together and talk about his creations,\\" she said. \\"They're so funny and so timely.\\"\\n\\nAdds Marie Schlump, the owner of the Purple Tiger, a New Haven gift shop, \\"The line is unique because it deals with the stresses of everyday life, getting stuck in traffic, having a screaming baby, and people love the shirts and cards because they're like a release. They also like the fact that he's a local guy who's always out having coffee in the cafes.\\" \\nHopes for Syndication\\n\\n Mr. Therrien said the Screaming Man will be around for a long time to come. His strip will soon be in three Advocate newspapers and he is working on having it syndicated in alternative newspapers nationwide. His original pen-and-inks as well as other paintings will be shown later this year in a gallery in Kansas where he was discovered after having drawn a cartoon on the Operation Rescue protests at abortion clinics in Wichita. Locally, his work will be displayed in the Daily Caffe in April.\\n\\nHis big dream, though, is to take the Screaming Man and assorted screaming women, serpents and babies to network televsion and \\"take on the Simpsons.\\" He recently completed a short animated feature of the Screaming Man, which appeared on three local cable shows. He is working up some plots for the Screaming Man and will perform the soundtrack himself, then shop the idea around to agents. \\n\\n\\"In some ways I think I'm glad I hit bottom because I have a clearer understanding of other people and myself and I appreciate everything that's happened to me,\\" said Mr. Therrien, who still participates in a recovery program and has been sober for eight years. \\"I wake up and most days I'm happy. I have something to look forward to.\\" Hey, Big Mouth!

It took 30 years of attack and retreat, skirmish and siege, before Robert Guiscard and his younger brother, the Great Count Roger, managed to wrest all of Sicily from the Saracens by 1091. The Normans had yet to become seagoers","excerpt":"they fought mainly on foot and on horseback, besieging the enemy in its mountaintop fortresses, charging down upon its armies in the river valleys, advancing slowly westward along the mountain ranges, the Nebrodi and the Madonie, that skirt the island's northern coast, edging their way toward Sicily's capital, the rich and cosmopolitan Palermo.    To trace the Normans' footsteps through these mountains today is to discover an unfamiliar side of Sicily, archaic and Arcadian, a land of rich pastures and heavily wooded slopes, with unexpected architectural treasures clinging to its peaks.   Given all the Normans' to-ing and fro-ing and the number of towns they captured, the brief pilgrimage my husband and I set out on recently involved some fairly arbitrary choices. Our plan was to strike south from the coast at Sant' Agata di Militello, cross the Nebrodi and then turn west at Cesaro on to Route 120, the road that runs along the ridge dividing the mountain valleys from the rolling wheatlands of Sicily's interior. We would let whim and the state of feet and stomach determine where we would linger and what we would leave for future visits.   Whim plus history required us to begin our pilgrimage on a pinnacle of pink marble that rises abruptly about 1,700 feet above the coastal plain. It was here, at San Marco d'Alunzio, that in 1061 the Normans built their first Sicilian fortress. With some 1,000 knights and as many foot soldiers (a ridiculously small army -- 30 buses' worth -- such as invades the Roman Forum or Agrigento's Valley of the Temples on any good morning), Robert and Roger had taken Messina by surprise, then marched into the interior and routed the army of the Emir, Ibn al-Hawas, 15,000 strong, under the ramparts of Enna. The onset of winter forced the Normans to withdraw to the mainland, but they left a garrison here, at San Marco, among the ruins of the ancient city of Aluntium, to control both the sea to the north and the mountain passes to the south.   The town of San Marco d'Alunzio is pretty and prosperous. Although most of the two- and three-story houses have been done over in modern and rather tasteless stucco, there is a sprinkling of handsome churches and many narrow alleys and arched stairways that betray its medieval origins.   All that remains of the fortress is a massive wall, disfigured by a concrete water tower; only a rabid Norman fan would feel it worth hiking up the town's steep streets to see where the Great Count's widow, Adelaide, held her first Sicilian court and where his son Roger II, the greatest of the Norman kings of Sicily, spent much of his early childhood. The real jewel of San Marco stands at the lower edge of town: the cella of an ancient temple to Hercules, converted by the Normans into the Church of San Marco. Very small, simple and roofless, it has as its only ornament a severe marble portal added during the Renaissance. Yet like the Norman cathedral at Trani, in Apulia, the church's golden stone has only sea and sky as a backdrop, and its pleasing pastiche of styles foreshadows the eclectic genius of Sicily's greatest Norman monuments.   The road south into the Nebrodi Mountains climbs almost 5,000 feet, soft rising curves that pass olive and almond groves, pine- and cypress-shaded villas. Once past the town of San Fratello, the oaks begin -- scrub and cork oaks, holm and Turkey oaks -- and then the Bosco della Miraglia, one of the few great forests of beech trees remaining in Sicily. Trees that stretch as far as the eye can see are balm indeed to the parched Sicilian soul, and this area, destined to become a regional park in the near future, is a favorite vacation spot for Sicilian nature lovers, who come to stay at one of the island's few country inns, and to walk in woods brilliant with turning foliage in the autumn and carpeted with low-lying mountain flowers in the spring. Huge hogs, hairy, black and alarmingly boarlike in appearance, snuffle through the underbrush in search of acorns, a diet that produces deliciously flavorful meat. Horses of the highly prized San Fratello breed graze in the clearings.    Beyond the pass of Portella Bella Miraglia, the woods thin out and open onto splendid views of Mount Etna and of the upper valley of the Simeto River. The houses and fields seem minuscule and ageless in the distance; we could be looking at the same landscape, the same woods and settlements that the Norman soldiers studied warily as they marched.   Leaving Etna behind us, we head west, past fields yellow with wheat stubble or newly plowed, toward a rocky spur that sticks up high on the horizon. This is Troina, perched 3,675 feet above sea level on its rock top and intimidating even for us who approach by car, and for whom conquest will mean no more than navigating the narrow streets that wind up to the citadel. Sheer stone walls rise menacingly from the rock, yesterday's fortress fashioned into today's cathedral. Of the old fortifications only one tower remains, converted into a campanile and pierced by an arch. A narrow alley leads under the arch and round behind the apse, to where the hewed stone of the cathedral walls meet the live rock of the cliff. From here, as from the terrace in front of the cathedral, all Sicily opens at one's feet: the soft hills of the central plain, the rugged mountains and tree-shaded valleys to the north, Etna blocking the eastern horizon.   One wonders if this view, imposing but windswept and chilly, was any consolation to Roger during the four terrible months he spent here with his bride in 1062, besieged by the Saracens from the surrounding countryside and by the Greek-speaking inhabitants of the town itself. The latter, weary of Muslim domination, first welcomed and then turned against their Norman deliverers who, for all that they were Christians too, seemed more interested in pillaging than in colonizing. Winter came early and fiercely that year, and the Normans were taken by surprise: Roger had a single woolen cloak to share with Judith, who, according to a contemporary chronicle, \\"had only her own tears with which to quench her thirst, only sleep to palliate the hunger that tormented her.\\" The Saracens also felt the cold and took to drinking the strong local wine for warmth. It was thanks to the soporific effect of this wine that in January of 1063 Roger and his soldiers were able to steal over the fortress walls and win back the surrounding town from the sleeping Saracen sentries.    After Troina, the road curves beneath the eroded crags and crumbling castle walls that stand benevolently over the town of Cerami, and then it descends gently into the river valley where in 1063 Roger won the battle that consolidated his control of central Sicily. As many as 20,000 Saracens were defeated by a mere 500 Normans, led to victory, they claimed, by St. George himself.   In token of thanks for heavenly intervention, Roger sent four of the Saracens' camels as a present to Pope Alexander II. It is difficult to imagine camels at pasture in these fields, where sleek cattle and fat sheep are grazing, the source of the excellent meat and cheese for which these mountains are famous.   We are unprepared for the quiet grace and the architectural riches of Nicosia, a town whose population still divides itself between the Nicoleti, the descendants of the original Greek-speaking inhabitants, and the Mariani, descended from the Latin-speaking colonists who came from Lombardy with Roger's third wife, Adelaide (after almost a thousand years, the Lombard influence still makes itself heard in the local dialect, quite incomprehensible to other Sicilians). The Mariani lived on top of the mountain, near the castle, and worshiped at what is now the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, while the Nicoleti lived down in the lower part of town and worshiped at the church of San Nicola. The rivalry between the two factions was so fierce that even on Good Friday each carried its own statue of Christ crucified about the town, and fists flew if one procession invaded the territory of the other. Only recently has the ill-feeling between the two groups diminished: the competing processions have been unified, and San Nicola is Chiesa Madre, the most important church in town.   San Nicola is a 14th-century church, with an elegant carved portal and a portico overlooking the town's main square. Its bell tower, a fusion of different periods, has heavy Norman foundations and delicate Gothic windows in the second story. The church's medieval interior was completely redecorated in later centuries, and frescoed vaulting hides its greatest treasure, a 14th-century wooden ceiling painted with saints, angels, animals and letters of the alphabet. In photographs it looks absolutely enchanting, but it is closed to the public.   One of the offices for which San Maria Maggiore and San Nicola competed was that of depositary of official measurements for Nicosia (before France introduced Europe to the metric system, the size of an acre or a pint would vary from town to town), and the Nicoleti boasted of their victory by carving the measures on the exterior of San Nicola's apse: incised in the stone behind the church are measures for grain and for ricotta, and the outline of the sole of a shoe (to show the length of a foot, I imagine).   The steep, stone-paved streets that climb the hill toward Santa Maria are lined with the houses of the local nobility, awkward but charming country cousins to the great Baroque palaces of Noto and Palermo: terrified mermen writhe over one portal, while elsewhere squashed lions roar with the pain of the weighty stone above them. Some of the old palaces and churches have fallen; wildflowers dance over tumbled stones and free-standing arches, and the air is full of birdsong. The little palm-shaded church of San Giuseppe marks the boundary that separated the two processing crucifixes on Good Friday; here the tall and elegant convent church of San Vincenzo has heavy iron gratings on all its windows, protection or imprisonment for the nuns inside.    Near the top of the hill stands Santa Maria Maggiore, built in the 18th century to replace a Norman church destroyed by a landslide (a local baron donated the facade from his palazzo, hence the pagan goddesses on the capitals). Below the church, weathered tile roofs descend sharply toward the piazza where the campanile of San Nicola looks up defiantly, and then they climb again toward the brick Romanesque bell tower of Il Salvatore del Mondo, which rises above the others' rivalries.   The view from Santa Maria Maggiore explains much about these Sicilian mountain towns: with little room at the top for modernization, the old neighborhoods that crowd around their citadels have remained unchanged, while expansion has headed downward. The younger generations with their new prosperity and their Benetton boutiques live down in the valley in the high-rises. Up here, the Sicily I first knew 30 years ago survives: the dowdy, narrow little stores with odd assortments of soaps and canned tomatoes, or bits of lace and baby clothes, the dingy cafes full of men with nothing to do and the silent streets, empty except for old women and cats.   More archaic still is the neighborhood we discover as we explore a little street to the north of Santa Maria, where the houses are half built on top of the rock and half carved into it. A many-colored rooster struts on the doorstep of 1 Via Nisi, which for all its gleaming whitewash and majolica-tiled street number, is no more than a hole in the rock. Across the street a sidewalk, protected by an iron railing, overlooks a steep cliff studded with prickly pears and riddled with caves that are strung together by paths, clotheslines and fences; this one a chicken coop, that one a storehouse, another stuffed with bales of hay. In front of one of the lower caves a shepherd is milking his flock.   Caves also dominate the southern side of the town of Sperlinga. Those that open onto the main street have been given 19th-century facades, flush with the rock, while above them walkways, complete with iron railings and street lanterns, zigzag their way up the face of the cliff. Each cave has a door and a street number, a few even have flowerpots or laundry strung out, although most of them were finally abandoned in the 1950's after some 27 centuries of use.   Even Sperlinga's castle, one of the most mysterious and most beautiful in Sicily, is a cave, at least in part. Above a long horizontal rift in the cliffside, thought to have first been fortified around 1000 B.C., the crenelated towers and arched walls of later centuries grow out of the living rock like giant lichens, and stairs carved into the pinnacle of the mountain lead up to the topmost tower.   It was just outside Sperlinga during the Allied invasion in 1943 that Robert Capa took his famous photograph of an enormous G.I. squatting down on his heels to ask directions of a tiny Sicilian shepherd. We pass a number of equally picturesque and photogenic shepherds as we drive along almost 50 years later, for changes have come slowly in the mountains, and lack of economic opportunity means that those who stay on here follow the old ways. In Sperlinga I talk to one of the elderly women who sell gaily colored rugs they weave by hand. Signora Nunzia weaves on a handsome wooden loom that takes up the whole front room of her house and has been in her family for several centuries; she is often spelled by her daughter, who is trained as a teacher but can find no work in Sperlinga.   The town of Gangi marks our passage from the Nebrodi to the Madonie. Unfairly prejudiced by the icy wind of a previous visit, we allot too little time to its bustling medieval streets and churches and push on to Petralia Soprana, the upper Petralia, as opposed to Petralia Sottana lower down the mountain.   Both towns are early -- Roger moved his headquarters west to the Petralias in 1066 -- both have some lovely churches and medieval houses, and both command beautiful views out over the surrounding valleys. According to the local tourist office, the lower Petralia is where the action is, but we are won over by the quiet backwaters of Petralia Soprana. In its deserted streets we meet Adelina, a snow-white goat who goes on walks with her master and comes when he whistles, and we stop to chat with the elderly women sweeping the little square in front of Santa Maria di Loreto, a pretty church of pale gray curlicues and twin steeples topped by colorful majolica. They move their brooms with loving precision across the pebbled patterns, readying the square for the coming Corpus Domini procession.   It was Roger's great-grandson, the Emperor Frederick II, who awarded the town of Polizzi Generosa the title \\"generosa\\" (the generous), an honor that is reflected in the scale of its churches and palaces, bigger and more grandiose than those of the Petralias, although the spirit is that of a small town. At a restaurant we find ourselves wedged between the mayor and his sidekicks (Christian Democrats) and two local magistrates (left-wing), whose good-natured political debate flies back and forth over our heads. A chance remark leads to conversation and then to a tour of the town, guided by mayor and magistrates, which includes the Madonia wildlife museum and the Flemish triptych, portraying the Madonna and Child surrounded by angels and saints, attributed by some to Hans Memling, that hangs behind the high altar of the Chiesa Madre.   One of the westernmost towns of the Madonie, Polizzi looks out over the Imera River valley to the mountains surrounding Palermo. From here it is possible to follow in haste on Roger's tracks, heading westward toward Palermo, toward the churches glittering with mosaics and the lush pleasure palaces of the Norman kings to come. But we want a last look at forest and castle and so choose a longer route, up over the mountains through Portella della Colla.   Like the Nebrodi, the Madonie are thickly wooded on their northern slopes, the surviving oak and chestnut forest integrated with reforested pines. This is where Palermo vacations and sometimes even skis in winter, but now rock cliffs rise from the autumn foliage, the turning colors brilliant in the slanting afternoon sun. Where the road forks, we turn toward Castelbuono, for a quick and self-indulgent visit to the \\"good castle,\\" a fortress powerful enough to have withstood the assaults of both enemy and time.   As massive, square and threatening as a gauntleted fist, the castle was built in the late 13th century by the Ventimiglias, the mightiest of the princely families that contended for the remains of the Norman kingdom. An imposing cobbled ramp, wide enough for a baron to ride up with all his armed escort about him, leads to the narrow portal and the porticoed grace of the inner courtyard.   On one of the upper floors the 18th-century owners built a chapel, decorated in the school of Palermo's famous stuccoists, the Serpottas. The rather mannered plasterwork -- macabre motifs of tormented saints and contorted cupids -- has nothing of the frothy gaiety of the Serpottas' Palermo oratories. In comparison to the vigor of the Norman ruins that we have been visiting and to the forcefulness of its own surroundings, the chapel exudes an atmosphere of decadence and empty display. It is a metaphor with which to end our Noman pilgrimage, an ornate reliquary of former might that sums up the centuries of violent power struggles and slow decline that followed upon the golden age of the Norman conquest.  FOLLOWING THE NORMANS     The Sicilian mountains are best visited in fall or spring (the flowers alone are worth the trip). Remember that this is not a tourist area: the hotels are very simple, although reasonable, clean and occasionally quite attractive. Following is a selective list of accommodations around the island. Full-pension prices are for one person for one day. All prices are calculated at a rate of 1,300 lire to $1. Unless noted, credit cards are not accepted.

There are 30 rooms, and a double room, with bath, is about $80; full pension is about $100. Reservations are necessary. RESTAURANTS    Plain but delicious mountain fare, in particular the well-flavored local pork and lamb, is served throughout this area. Following is a sampling of restaurants.   SPERLINGA: RISTORANTE LA MADONNINA, Contrada Cicera (935-64330), serves local lamb and such dishes as pasta mucciata, cooked eggplant stuffed with pasta, tomatoes and cheese. Dinner for two, with local wine, is about $35.   POLIZZI GENEROSA: RISTORANTE ITRIA, 3 Via Itria (921-88543), offers the local lamb and pork and such dishes as pasta with asparagus. Dinner for two, with local wine, is about $30.    CASTELBUONO: RISTORANTE VECCHIO PALMENTO, 2 Via Failla (921-72099), presents historical local food, from old family recipes. Specialties include dishes made with the local lamb and pork, and a dessert called Testa di Turco (Turk's head), a pancake with cream filling. Dinner for two, with local wine, is about $50. SOMETHING SWEET    The local hazelnut and almond crops get put to good use at the area's pastry shops, among them PASTICCERIA LA BLUNDA (Via Fratelli Testa, Nicosia), PASTICCERIA INGUAGGIATO (Corso P. Agliata. Petralia Sottana) and PASTICCERIA LIMA (50 Via Garibaldi, Polizzi Generosa). The last two make sfoglio delle Madonie, a pastry that has sheep cheese in its spicy filling, but bears no resemblance to cheesecake.

(Ms. Paparizou is seen at right in the finale in Kiev, Ukraine, demonstrating skills we haven't seen from Kelly Clarkson or Ruben Studdard.) Both contests involve mass balloting by television viewers and intense debates about voting patterns. But in Eurovision, those patterns are a lot more complicated: this year's contest involved voters from 39 countries, representing multiple languages, cultures and historical animosities. Those relationships drew the attention of Neil F. Johnson, a professor of physics at Oxford University, who, in ''How Does Europe Make Its Mind Up?,'' set out to quantify how geopolitics factors in with lyrics, voice and smile. The paper (online at http://arxiv.org/PS--cache/physics/pdf/0505/0505071.pdf) was written with three other Oxford scholars. ''Like so many other systems,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''Eurovision is an economy where things are exchanging information over time.'' Among his findings, based on voting from 1992 to 2003: (1) While many voting affinities were geographically predictable, some were surprising. For instance: Scandinavian and Estonian voters tended to favor the same songs. Looking deeper, Mr. Johnson found that Estonia's large Finnish population was probably the reason. (2) While Britain is often branded the most Europhobic of European nations, its voters were the most ''in tune'' with the continent","excerpt":"they gave more points to new Central European countries than voters from other older nations, and they began voting for eventual winners earlier and in greater numbers. (3) France, on the other hand, was ''the most out of tune'' in its voting; French viewers consistently failed to vote for the countries that were most likely to vote for France. All of this, of course, has wounded various European sensibilities. ''You wouldn't believe my e-mail box,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''I open it in fear every morning.''

Coach Farms in Pine Plains, N.Y., has just introduced fresh pasteurized goat's milk in a number of stores in New York. The milk tastes similar to rich cow's milk, but has a somewhat cleaner flavor and a nice creamy aftertaste. It has none of the tanginess generally associated with cheeses made of goat's milk.    Because the fat globules in goat's milk are considerably smaller than those in cow's milk, people who have trouble digesting cow's milk sometimes have no problem with goat's milk. Goat's milk is also somewhat higher in calcium and potassium than cow's milk.    Coach Farms goat's milk is sold at the Union Square Greenmarket on Wednesdays and Saturdays for $2.75 a quart and $4.75 a half gallon. It is also available at Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth Street), for $2.98 a quart; at Fairway, 2127 Broadway (74th Street), for $2.89 a quart and $4.79 a half gallon; at Todaro Brothers, 555 Second Avenue (30th Street), for $2.99 a quart, and at Canard and Company, 1292 Madison Avenue (92nd Street), for $3.90 a quart. In Brooklyn, it is sold at Back to the Land, 142 Seventh Avenue (near Carroll Street), Park Slope, for $3.15 a quart and $5.25 a half gallon.    As for cow's milk, Farmland Dairies in Wallington, N.J., now produces a skim milk called Skim Plus, bolstered not only with more protein and calcium than regular skim milk but with the richness and body more commonly associated with low-fat milks. It sells for about 80 cents a quart.   And for people with a lactose intolerance, the company has added two milks labeled Easylac. One is skim, the other 1 percent fat, and both have had 80 percent of the lactose removed, making them lower in lactose than other similar brands currently on the market. These milks are ultrapasteurized, giving them a longer shelf life than regular cow's milk. They have good body and a somewhat sweet flavor. Both milks cost about $1.20 a quart.   The new Farmland Dairies milks are sold at Waldbaum's, Grand Union, Kings, Food Town, Met Food and other supermarkets. Edible Tools    Forget the chocolate golf balls for Father's Day. Dean & DeLuca, 560 Broadway (at Prince Street), is selling a small open wooden box that looks like a tool carrier and comes filled with dark Valrhona chocolate in the shapes of tools like hammers and wrenches.    The delicious chocolate tools are dusted with cocoa, making them look rusty, as though they had been sitting unused in some corner of the cellar for years -- which might make them especially appropriate for some golf-playing dads. They are the whimsical creation of a superb chocolate maker, Ortrude Carstens, and come 10 to the box for $32. They are also sold individually for $2.  Food Meets Design    The Grocery, 532 Columbus Avenue, sells very little in the way of real food. But the toys, household goods, gift items, gadgets and other products carried in this new shop are all inspired by food. Some are clever, some genuinely useful and some, like the rubber chicken and the underwear packed in a beer bottle, are tasteless.    Throw pillows realistically shaped and printed to look like large fish (about a five-pound salmon, for example) and packed in supermarket-style foam trays and plastic wrap, great for decorating a beach house, are $23; a package of official Star Trek freeze-dried rations, enough for a meal, is $8, and inflatable pool floats that look like giant bagels are $11.95. The shop also carries old-fashioned penny candy, like wax lips.  CENTURIES OF SOUP WARE    MORE than 100 rare soup tureens from the Campbell Soup collection are on exhibit at the Newark Museum in Newark, N.J., through Aug. 16. The first such showing of the items outside the Campbell Museum at the company's headquarters in Camden, N.J., features tureens dating to the 16th century, ladles and historic soup plates, including one owned by George Washington. There are tureens shaped like chickens, rabbits and even a boar's head designed so the steam comes out of the mouth.   The museum, at 49 Washington Street, Newark, is open Wednesday through Sunday, noon to 5 P.M. Admission is free. There will be a talk on the exhibit tomorrow at 12:30 P.M.

A pictorial prologue and epilogue, a narrator's voice breaking into the film at a dozen points eliminate the danger of any one's failure to see the relation between this picture of the last World War and the actuality of the present world war","excerpt":"they guarantee, also, that even the dullest of us are made to understand that Remarque thought war was stupid and futile and probably thinks so still. But, as an afterthought, Universal's narrative comment goes Remarque's \\"All Quiet\\" one better: it becomes pretty vengeful when it speaks of Hitler and the Nazis. Thus the revised \\"All Quiet\\" is not simply a grief-bowed record of war, but an indictment of one of the war-makers.That it isn't as good a film this way, that it comes, in fact, closer to stupid vandalism—and what can be more stupid than mutilation of one's own art treasures?—is merely a personal opinion. I've no doubt a number of filmgoers will find that its semi-documentary beginning and close, its narrator's fuller-explanation service lend it topical significance and patriotic fervor. (For, after all, \\"All Quiet\\" showed that the German soldier bled and suffered, laughed, joked, was bewildered, loved and died, too; and that may be a treasonable opinion to hold in some quarters today.) We are glad that the picture has been brought back, for there are things in it that cannot be killed even by opportunist editors; but we should have preferred seeing it as it was before it went through its second battle on Hollywood's western front.Why does Madame Lafont shoot her pretty unmarried sister in the opening sequence of \\"The Affair Lafont\\"? That is the question to which the rest of the picture addresses itself with typical Gallic relish of the domestic secret, of the illegitimate child, of the emotional problems of blondes. It is only fair to warn you that, while the Little Carnegie's new French tenant is reasonably entertaining and suspenseful within the bounds of its conventional plot, some little patience may be required to sit out its devious probings and pryings into the lives of characters who possess after all no interest save that of the chronique scandaleuse.Among the film's more definite assets must be listed the dead-pan charm of Corinne Luchaire and the inverted narrative method, by which one's interest continues to be held even beyond that point at which the characters and the plot fail. But French dialogue, when there is too much of it, has a sweet soothingness to the ear, the effect of which may in time become the very opposite of what the authors intended.At the CameoA grim and gory hodgepodge of old World War films and post-war newsreel shots, slapped together without any intelligent continuity and prefaced only by a few clips from newsreels of the last month, is being shown at the Cameo as a \\"new documentary\\" under the title \\"Why This War?\\" Most of the material is stale from repetition, having been lifted from the long available archives of the governments which fought the last World War, and is so sloppily and pointlessly assembled that it offers no conclusion whatsoever, outside of a purely arbitrary insistence by its narrator that wars are caused by diplomats and \\"merchants of death.\\"This picture was edited by Samuel Cummins, who is known in industry circles as a producer of \\"sensational\\" films, and bears more than a suspicious resemblance to two of his former shockers, \\"Forgotten Men\\" (1933) and \\"War Is a Racket\\" (1934).At the Teatro HispanoStarting off on a rather serious note, \\"Gente Bien,\\" the Argentine picture now at the Teatro Hispano, quickly mixes a lot of comedy with its indictment of the \\"high society\\" of Buenos Aires slangily covered by its name. Consequently the audience soon forgets its wrath at the heartless villain (Marcelo Ruggero) and has a good time watching the setting of the trap (baited with the personable June Marlowe), the springing of which puts an end to his machinations and brings happiness to Hugo del Carril and Delia Garces.Señor Carril sings several tango bits with his usual verve, and Señorita Garces displays considerable charm as the governess victim of her cold-blooded employer's son. She also reveals a modest, pleasing voice. Hollywood make-up men probably could enhance her attractiveness by narrowing her sensitive mouth. Manuelo Romero directed this entertaining E. F. A. production at a fast pace.At the Modern PlayhouseWithout resorting to rough stuff, Bela Balogh, director of \\"Keserü Mézeshetek\\" (\\"Bitter Honeymoon\\"), the new Standard Film production at the Modern Playhouse, has managed to pack this rather commonplace Magyar tale of matrimonial mixups full of amusing incidents.While the audience knows that Antal Pager's separation from his pert and sweet little bride (Zita Szeleczky) on their honeymoon trip to Venice won't last too long, it follows with a good deal of interest the development of the action which reunites them and naturally lands their temporary partners in confusion (Lajos Basthy and Klari Tolnay) into each other's arms.As usual in Hungarian pictures, the acting of the whole company is first-class.At the 86th St. Garden TheatreIda Wuest, one of the busiest and most popular of Germany's middle-aged actresses, works hard in the title role of \\"Die kluge Schwiegermutter\\" (\\"The Wise Mother-in-Law\\"), a moderately amusing comedy romance on view at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre. She is competently assisted by pretty Charlotte Daudert, as her daughter, and Christian Gollong, as the young chemist in a perfume factory who finally becomes her son-in-law, largely because he and his boss (Georg Alexander) have the same name.Others prominent in the cast are Walter Steinbeck, Ernst Waldow and Erich Fiedler. The story is routine enough, but there are plenty of merry incidents to compensate for the lack of suspense. Nevertheless, Hans Deppe, who directed this UFA picture, might have speeded it up and abbreviated some of the dialogue to the advantage of the audience.

She was born on June 26, 1912 in Chicago, the daughter of Conyers Read, a historian, and Edith Coulson Kirk Read. She grew up in Villanova, PA., and graduated from Vassar College in 1933. At Vassar, she saw classmates forced to withdraw because of the Great Depression, and so organized a successful undergraduate effort to raise enough funds to bring them all back. In 1932-33, she was elected head of the Vassar student body and vice president of the National Federation of Students. In 1933-34, she worked as assistant dean in charge of residence halls at Barnard College and as grading supervisor for the Educational Testing Service. She received an M.A. in Sociology from Columbia University (1934) and, with support from a Vassar fellowship, a Ph.D. in history from Yale University (1938). At Yale she was drawn into the study of English parliamentary history under the aegis of Hartley Simpson and Wallace Notestein. In 1938, she married Richard W. Foster, a bookseller","excerpt":"they had four sons. She returned to academic life in 1953 as a part-time instructor of history at Ursinus College, Collegeville, PA (assistant professor 1956, associate 1962) and a visiting associate professor at the University of Delaware (196263). Her first book, ''Proceedings in Parliament 1610'' (2 volumes, 1965), established her as a leading scholar of Stuart England. She was appointed Research Fellow and Acting Director of the Yale Center for Parliamentary History (1965) and Professor of History at Bryn Mawr College (professor emeritus 1981). As first dean of the Bryn Mawr Graduate School (1966-70), she reorganized it as the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (dean 1970-73). She worked to raise the faculty and student standards of the Graduate School and to enhance its position nationally, especially through her service on the Committee on Policies, Plans and Resolutions and on the Executive Committee of the Council of Graduate Schools. She presided over a period of rapid growth in the Graduate School, including two new programs (Biochemistry and the History of Science), and was an effective seeker of federal funds for education. She also found financial support for part-time study and actively encouraged graduate student self-government and faculty research. Her interests in the history of English parliamentary and judicial procedure and recordkeeping were further developed in three books, ''The House of Lords 1603-1649'' (1983) and two studies of Henry Elsyng, clerk of the parliaments 1621-35, ''The Painful Labour of Mr. Elsyng'' (1972) and ''Judicature in Parliament by Henry Elsyng Clerk of the Parliaments'' (1991), and in numerous articles. After retirement, she was special advisor to the president of Bryn Mawr College on various projects, including design and construction of new library facilities and the expansion of the science building, and continued her lifelong association with the editorial board and advisory council of the Yale Center for Parliamentary History. In 1979, the Yale Graduate School awarded her its Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal for outstanding achievement in scholarship, teaching and academic administration. She was a member of the American Historical Association (editorial board of the ''American Historical Review,'' 1979-81), the Conference on British Studies (council, 1968-73), the Royal Historical Society, Society of Antiquaries, the British Museum, Middle Atlantic Conference on British Studies and other professional associations. In civic and private life, she was active for some years in the Pennsylvania League of Women Voters and the Federation for Planned Parenthood, and was always interested in supporting education opportunities for women.

A roundelay of romantic entanglements and low-life skulduggery set in an imaginary Spanish resort community, the series was everything that Anglophilic admirers of Masterpiece Theater think is foreign to British television: bloated, leaden, dull. Worst of all, it committed the sin of sins for a soap: the characters weren't sexy, weren't appealing, weren't in any way suitable for fantastical self-projection by couch potatoes. They weren't even ordinary enough to seem lifelike. Money Couldn't Buy Love    The set alone, built in southern Spain, cost more than $3 million; the budget was five times that, making the show the most expensive independent production ever commissioned by the BBC. The critics, especially in London's tabloid press, were merciless: \\"In its early days, 157 episodes ago, 'Eldorado' was almost treasurably bad,\\" The Guardian wrote just before the final show on July 9. \\"But then it began to improve. It became mediocre instead of dire.\\" The audience watched elsewhere, with rarely more than a third of the projected 15 million people tuning in. The Producer's Assessment    As it happens, \\"Eldorado\\" was meant, at least in part, to be a serious soap, and its producer, Verity Lambert, has been quoted to the effect that it failed not because it was bad but because it was too experimental. Her credits, after all, include shows of just the sort that have given British television a good name in the United States: \\"Dr. Who,\\" \\"Rumpole of the Bailey,\\" \\"The Naked Civil Servant\\" and the like.

Economists said the report showed that the Federal Reserve had room to cut interest rates again to perk up the slowly recovering economy.    The Producer Price Index, which also went up by two-tenths of 1 percent in March and in February, has risen so far this year at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 1 percent, the Labor Department said.    \\"One reason the inflation rate is so low is the sluggish economy,\\" said Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, a banking company in Minneapolis. \\"I think the Fed will recognize this and take appropriate action as soon as possible.\\"  Consumer Data Due Today    Analysts predict the Fed will wait to act until it sees if the low inflation figures are confirmed by the Consumer Price Index, which is scheduled to be released Wednesday.    \\"We will see further progress in reducing inflation in the C.P.I.,\\" said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.    That would ease any fears that another move to cut interest rates, which have been coming down steadily for more than a year, would overheat the economy and stoke inflation.    Mr. Sohn contends the central bank should be aggressive and move for cuts of half a percentage point in both the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for loans, and the discount rate, which the Fed charges banks for loans.    Many economists maintain that such a move by the Fed would persuade banks to cut their prime lending rates by half a point. Many business and consumer loans are pegged to the prime.    Most banks' prime rates are at 6 1/2 percent, although Chemical Bank in New York, the nation's fourth-largest, cut its rate to 6 1/4 percent after the Fed's most recent push, on April 9, to lower the Federal funds rate to 3 3/4 percent from 4 percent.    The Labor Department said the core rate of wholesale inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, also rose by two-tenths of 1 percent in April. Goods at the intermediate level rose one-tenth of 1 percent, and crude prices were up three-tenths.    Wholesale food prices fell three-tenths of 1 percent in April after dropping five-tenths in March. Energy prices advanced by five-tenths last month, mainly because of increases in the price of refined oil products","excerpt":"they had shot up 1.2 percent in March.  Some economists expressed concern about the rise in energy prices.   \\"It's a good number,\\" said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University, referring to the overall index. \\"But there are some special circumstances.\\"  Gasoline and Heating Oil    He noted that gasoline prices rose by 1.4 percent last month, after gaining 1.1 percent in March. Heating oil was up 4.6 percent in April, after advancing two-tenths of 1 percent in March and 16.2 percent in February.     But other economists said the rise in energy prices should not deter Fed policy makers from easing credit.    \\"Energy is clearly not something that can be rectified by monetary policy, and they should not be concerned about it,\\" said Mr. Gramley, a former Fed board member.    Michael Boskin, chief economic adviser to President Bush, said he thought the Fed was prepared to lower interest rates if inflation remained under control and the recovery appeared to falter.  Bond Prices Head Up    \\"They have the opportunity and the will to do something extra if necessary,\\" Mr. Boskin told reporters in Paris, where he was at a meeting.    Inflation-sensitive Treasury bond prices surged on the producer prices report, with the 30-year issue up more than half a point, cutting its yield to 7.86 percent, from 7.88 percent Monday. Stock prices fell, however, as investors awaited the consumer price report on Wednesday.     Recent data show that business activity is gradually picking up speed, which would traditionally argue for the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to hold the line on interest rates. The committee is scheduled to meet next Tuesday.   But economists said the Fed needed to insure that the recovery took hold and did not falter, as it did last year. They added that the tepid 2 percent annual rate of economic growth recorded in the first quarter was not enough to accomplish that.

He was impossible to miss. Standing nearly seven feet tall with a body that sportswriters would later describe as Adonis-like, Dare was 18 and playing for the Nigerian national team when he was spotted in Lagos in 1991 by an assistant coach from George Washington University. He had started playing basketball only two years earlier and his skills were still raw, but there was no denying his physical attributes. And then there was his desire: Dare's first love had been tennis, but determined to escape his meager existence in the northern Nigerian city of Kano, he devoted himself to basketball. Inspired by his countryman and idol Hakeem Olajuwon -- and Manute Bol of Sudan and Dikembe Mutombo of Congo -- Dare hoped to make millions in the N.B.A. Hoop dreams, it turned out, were no longer just a phenomenon of America's inner cities","excerpt":"they had taken root in Africa too.     Soon after being discovered, Dare (pronounced dar-RAY) made the journey west. At the direction of the George Washington coaching staff, he first went to Milford Academy, a prep school in Connecticut, for a year of seasoning. Then in 1992, he received an athletic scholarship to attend George Washington, where he helped turn a middling basketball program into a national power. His coach, Mike Jarvis, estimated that simply by stepping on the court for warm-ups, Dare was worth five or six baskets a game. ''He was that intimidating,'' Jarvis said. And once the game started, the intimidation continued. On defense, Dare would stand in the foul lane and block practically any shot that came within his enormous reach; and while he didn't score much, when he did -- usually on ferocious, rim-rattling dunks -- the psychological impact of his baskets was far greater than two points.

In the advertising world, romance rarely flourishes between the creative and business sides. \\"In creative, they call the account people 'suits,' \\" Ms. Rudberg said. \\"My boss at the time banned account people from coming onto the creative floor. Once, as a practical joke, somebody outlined a dead body in chalk on the floor and wrote, 'Account guy.' \\"    Mr. Thibodeau, 28, is now working on commercials for Brute cologne at Lintas. Like an actor getting into character, he always wears Brute. Ms. Rudberg, 31, now works at the Lotas Minard Patton McIver agency, where she's known for wearing hats made of everything from fake leopard skin to fake green grass and for being the pickiest perfectionist in the office.    Judy Lotas, a partner in the agency, recently saw the movie \\"Blink\\" with the bride. \\"The other people in the theater were screaming because it was sort of scary, but the only time Linda shrieked was when the female lead's lipstick had disappeared and she just had her naked lip liner on,\\" Ms. Lotas said. \\"Linda gets esthetically horrified.\\"    The couple, who compared planning their wedding with working on a commercial together, spent a year organizing the event, which turned out to be stylishly homemade and personal, down to the tiniest detail.   For instance, a shower for the bride at her Upper West Side apartment was actually a poetry reading. She asked about 20 friends, all women, to bring poems, instead of kitchen utensils or lingerie, and read them aloud.    For the wedding invitations, the couple bought handmade paper that looked like granite -- blue with white and gray specks -- from an art supply store in the East Village","excerpt":"they had them printed by hand at SoHo Service. Even the vases for the wedding had the bride's colorful, quirky imprint on them. Ms. Rudberg, a potter, had made dozens of vases -- pink polka-dotted, striped and otherwise Dr. Seuss-inspired, each filled with a one-of-a-kind floral arrangement.   For the wedding, the couple scouted locations on the East Coast and eventually chose the Canfield Casino, an ornate, turn-of-the-century building in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Now city-owned, the casino has a carved oak bar, a gentleman's gambling room and a ballroom with a barrel ceiling decorated with stained-glass medallions the size of manhole covers.    At an interfaith ceremony on Feb. 19 -- she is Jewish, and he is Protestant -- the couple looked their account-creative parts. Mr. Thibodeau wore a dark conservative suit, while the bride appeared in an enormous tulle hat and a white cotton dress as simple as a monk's cassock. Guests compared the hat to everything from a cumulus cloud to a souffle to a geyser of Saratoga Springs sparkling water.    Dinner was served in the ballroom, where the ceiling medallions depict the 12 signs of the zodiac. Even they held a personal meaning for the bride and bridegroom: she is a Capricorn, and he is a Virgo, two very compatible signs.    As the bride recalled: \\"After we met, my mother didn't ask, 'Is he Jewish?' She asked, 'What sign is he?' \\" Linda Rudberg, Steven Thibodeau"},{"year":"1982","title":"On the fourth floor of the American Museum of Natural History, 77th Street and Central Park West, are the Halls of the Early and Late Dinosaurs, the showcase of the museum's collection, the world's largest, of these ancient creatures that once ruled the global roost.

It's the old conflict between splendid churches and Quaker meeting houses, but now transposed to the world of sound. Is beauty, in other words, a seducer, something that leads us to confuse sensuous pleasure with devotion? Or is it a catalyst, religion's persuasive advocate? A lot of blood has been shed over that one in the last 1,000 years.   The practical side of the argument says that great music performed by experts puts Christians in the right frame of mind. A number of churches putting on Handel's \\"Messiah\\" this week seem to have thought along those lines. Orchestras were hired, and in most cases paid choir members found themselves joined by paid extras. Three \\"Messiah\\" presentations were at Episcopal parishes, all evidently with affluent memberships. \\"We have sophisticated parishioners","excerpt":"they have come to expect music well done,\\" said one singer in a choir he described as \\"99 percent professional.\\" With orchestra rehearsals and top-of-the line soloists, productions like this can run about $30,000.

Now, however, the guitar has been supplanted by light, cheap, battery-powered keyboards with built-in rhythm patterns, which don't even require calluses on a player's left hand.

The passenger door was open and a man's feet were sticking over the edge of the seat. My first reaction was that my colleague had a heart attack. When I got closer, I saw a strange man trying to hot-wire the car.   \\"Hey you!\\" I said. \\"That's not your car. Get out of there right now and move on or I'll call a cop.\\"   He leaned up on one elbow, grinned and said, \\"Hey, chill out,\\" and got out.    \\"No harm done,\\" he said. \\"I didn't bust nothing. Just need some quick wheels. Can't fault a guy for trying.\\"   The car wasn't damaged, so I slammed the door shut.

GORBACHEV, it used to be said, plays a weak hand brilliantly, and this talent was never more in evidence than during his just concluded two-week tour of the United States. Mr. Gorbachev is out of office, on a meager pension, and is hounded back home by charges about his role in this or that abuse of power. Yet he got Americans to treat him like a head of state, promise him millions, and confine the conversation to such tame questions as who started the cold war (no one was going to blame    him,    after all), how to reorganize the United Nations, and how to deal with global environmental pollution. The man at the center of the most important political revolution of our time came and went without providing a single new revelation, not one sharp insight or telling detail, about what happened.   For Russians, this result will come as no surprise. Radio Moscow recently expressed doubt that Mr. Gorbachev had anything \\"new, practical, interesting or unexpected\\" to say to foreign listeners. His ability to grow rich while saying nothing will be especially galling to those former Soviet officials, high and low, who -- whether as consultants to Western corporations or as participants in oral history projects -- are trying to sell what little they know about the system for a few measly dollars. Even Pravda, now the voice of reaction, grumbled that when he gets home Mr. Gorbachev ought to tell his own people the truth about such episodes as the crackdown in the Baltic states in January 1991.

Brashares, who is 37 and lives in New York, has published two enormously popular young-adult novels, ''The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants'' and ''The Second Summer of the Sisterhood,'' both of which read like episodes of ''My So-Called Life'' that have been flecked with pixie dust. (Her books are No. 2 in a combined ranking on the children's series list, which appears this week on Page 18.) Brashares's novels are about four close friends who negotiate the final years of high school with the help of some slightly magical jeans. (What's magical about them? They fit each of  the girls, who have different body sizes, perfectly.) The third novel in this series, ''Girls in Pants,'' is just out. It includes a list of the rules the girls have concocted to govern the use of their empowering pants, and it's a list that captures a bit of Brashares's crisp comic tone. Rule No. 2 reads: ''You must never double-cuff the Pants. It's tacky. There will never be a time when this will not be tacky.'' Yet these books don't shy away from weightier issues, among them sex. Here is Rule No. 4: ''You must never let a boy take off the Pants (although you may take them off yourself in his presence).'' Brashares, who worked in publishing before writing her first book, is the product of a pretty good education: she attended the Sidwell Friends School in Washington and was a philosophy major at Barnard. The young women in ''Girls in Pants'' have more than bluejeans and boys on their minds, too. They are off, we learn, to Brown, Williams, N.Y.U. film school and the Rhode Island School of Design.    EDUCATING JUNIE: Junie B. Jones, the feisty heroine of the 24 books in Barbara Park's ''Junie B.'' series, has a long way to go before she can think about applying to Brown. For one thing, she's in the first grade. For another, she mangles language as gleefully as any young sprite since Tom Sawyer. (''This is the fibbingest day of my life,'' Junie says on Halloween, after being forced to say ''thank you'' for a box of raisins.)

Eating hard-shell crabs is a summer ritual for the people who call Washington home at one time or another. That transient city gathers in people from all over the world, and an invitation to a crab feast on a late Saturday or Sunday afternoon is an invitation to an event unlike anything most of them have ever seen before.   To begin with, it is the most informal of parties in the most formal of cities. You cannot wear a sport jacket, not even a tie, and still eat crabs comfortably. And cloth tablecloths are an affectation. Crab feasting is a down-and-dirty operation that requires dozens of paper napkins, large bibs, tablecloths made from brown paper or plastic shower curtains, wooden mallets and guests who are not afraid to get their hands dirty with the red-pepper mix that coats the crabs when they are steamed. ''You get into it up to your elbows,'' she explains. That does not mean the Koteen crab feast looks like a fire sale at a hardware store.

Let us temperately admit that \\"Fantasia\\" is simply terrific—as terrific as anything that has ever happened on a screen. And then let's get on from there.For the vital report this morning is that Mr. Disney and his troop of little men, together with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra and a corps of sound engineers, have fashioned with music and colors and animated figures on a screen a creation so thoroughly delightful and exciting in its novelty that one's senses are captivated by it, one's imagination is deliciously inspired. In the same fresh, light-hearted spirit which has marked all their previous cartoons Mr. Disney and the boys have gone aromping in somewhat more esoteric fields","excerpt":"they have taken eight symphonic numbers which are generally reserved for the concert halls, let Mr. Stokowski's band record them on multiple sound tracks, and have then given them visual accompaniments of vast and spellbinding range. In brief, they have merged high-toned music with Disney's fantastic imagery.What the music experts and the art critics will think of it we don't know. Olin Downes is making the official observation for his department in an adjoining column. Probably there will be much controversy, and maybe some long hair will be pulled. Artistic innovations never breed content. But for this corner's money—and, we reckon, for the money of any one who takes it in the blithe and wondrous spirit in which it is offered—\\"Fantasia\\" is enchanting entertainment. This is one time, we warrant, you won't want to listen to music with your eyes shut.For, as mentioned, you need not expect the customary collaboration of film and music. From the beginning—from before the beginning, in fact, when vague shadows of musicians appear on the screen, when the sound of instruments being tuned is heard and when finally the theatre lights go down and Deems Taylor steps up on the orchestra platform to introduce the show—it is obvious that this is a visual concert, with Mr. Taylor participating as commentator. It is, he explains, a representation of \\"designs and pictures and stories\\" which the selected music has inspired in the minds of a group of artists. Then Mr. Stokowski — or rather his shadow—dramatically ascends the podium, and the concert begins.Some of the High PointsThe first number is Bach's Toccata and Fugue, illustrated abstractly on the screen with brilliant colors flowing and merging, lacy figures cometing through space, a sky-writing cipher tracing patterns and sprays of falling stars. It is intended, obviously, to create the necessary mood of reverie, of immaterial detachment necessary to the complete comprehension and enjoyment of the entire program. At its conclusion, Mr. Taylor returns to explain the second selection — Tchaikovsky's \\"Nutcracker Suite\\"—and so the picture goes.Space limitations prevent a detailed consideration of each number. But the high points cannot be overlooked. There is, for instance, the fragile and shimmering beauty of tiny fairies placing dewdrops on cobwebs in the first passage of the \\"Nutcracker Suite\\" and the lovable humors of the Chinese mushrooms dancing in the same selection; there is the familiar hectic comedy of Mickey Mouse in Dukas's \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\\" the titanic upheavals of the earth and the roaring battles of prehistoric animals in Stravinsky's \\"Rite of Spring,\\" the winsome charm of baby fauns and sleek little centaurettes gamboling on pink fields of asphodel in Beethoven's \\"Pastoral Symphony\\" and the superb satire on ballet, with ostrich, hippopotamus and elephant performers, in Ponchielli's \\"Dance of the Hours.\\" The final selections are Mussorgsky's \\"Night on Bald Mountain,\\" visualized with a weird and terrifying assortment of skeletons, ghouls and imps swirling around the monstrous devil of the mountain, and then a solemn, liturgical illustration of Schubert's \\"Ave Maria.\\"Naturally, there are things about this film which one might readily criticize. The elaborate sound-projection system, of which there has been much talk, seems to possess many remarkable advantages, not least of which is its ability to \\"place\\" sounds. But it also amplifies them too much in certain passages—and that is hard on the ears. Also the length of the picture—more than two hours—tends to weary the senses, to dull one's receptiveness. Sometimes the color is too \\"pretty,\\" especially in the \\"Pastoral,\\" and frequently the dramatic action on the screen becomes so absorbing that the music, the primary music, takes an incidental place.Both those are esthetic details which the majority will casually ignore. Mr. Disney said himself the other night that there are many problems he has yet to lick, that \\"Fantasia\\" is a frank experiment. Perhaps so, but it is also the most original and provocative film in some time. If you don't mind having your imagination stimulated by the stuff of Mr. Disney's fanciful dreams, go to see it. It's a transcendent blessing these days.

A NUMBER of scientists have recently suggested that the observed order in the universe, and especially the order required to support life, cannot easily be explained within traditional science. In 1974, the physicist Brandon Carter embodied this notion in the ''Anthropic Principle,'' which, in some versions, states that if such fundamental physical constants as the forces in atoms were much different in strength, then atoms (and planets and people) could never have formed in the first place. Why should a universe care about making atoms, or life? In 1979, the biologist James Lovelock cast his version of the idea in the ''Gaia'' hypothesis, which claims that the entire earthly biosphere, including atmosphere and oceans and soil, is a self-regulating system, maintaining the delicate conditions for life against staggering odds. Why should our planet offer us such hospitality? These ideas, in broad terms, are centuries old","excerpt":"they have taken on new precision with the advances of science.

It is not always easy to distinguish from social work, and it is certainly a long way in conception from the old model of \\"plop\\" art, with its casual regard for the relationship between sculpture and site. The new public art also goes beyond the percent-for-art programs that emerged during the 1970's and 80's and aspired to bring artists and architects closer together in planning new buildings and urban designs.   The latest brand of public art is something else again: artists collaborating directly with the communities that will come into contact with the work, the process of collaboration becoming, in many cases, as important as the end result.   The approach, strictly speaking, isn't new. Its roots -- and the problems it poses -- go back at least to the 1960's, grounded as they are in movements like Process Art and Performance Art, and in the left-wing political activism that moved artists of that time from their studios to the streets (not only here but abroad, as in London, where Conrad Atkinson and Stephen Willats collaborated with workers from the East End). The political art of recent years has spawned a new generation of artists and curators who have picked up strands of 60's thinking and adapted them to 90's issues.   The latest manifestation of the new public art has been in evidence here, during the last few months, in a program that winds down this week called \\"Culture in Action.\\" It was sponsored by Sculpture Chicago, supported by money from the National Endowment for the Arts and various private groups and organized by Mary Jane Jacob, an independent curator. The program (total cost around $800,000) is actually eight separate projects, mostly in neighborhoods distant -- if not geographically, then economically and sociologically -- from Chicago's gleaming commercial heart.   The outcomes of such projects have been about as far from the towering Picasso and Calder sculptures that adorn Chicago's Loop as can be imagined","excerpt":"they have taken the form of block parties and parades, paint charts, chocolate bars and hydroponically grown leafy vegetables.    One project is based in the hotly contested area near Maxwell Street, for a century a thriving Old World bazaar in the shadow of the Loop. There, city planners and a nearby university have combined to raze blocks as part of a scheme to build athletic fields and other structures and eliminate the busy marketplace that still caters mostly to low-income people.   Another project took place on a West Town street, a couple of miles west of the Loop, occupied mainly by Latinos and fractured by competing gangs. Yet another took place in a factory where a dozen union workers from a large chocolate company banded together to design their own candy bar and wrapper. And a project that involved hundreds of people united members of disparate communities across the city, including a Mexican-American neighborhood around Harrison Park and the black neighborhood around Garfield Park.   The Chicago program is only one example of the new public art. In a kind of collaboration with their South Bronx neighbors, John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres have produced sculptures depicting residents of that community. Other public art blurs the division between advertising and art, volunteerism and Conceptualism. The red ribbon that has come to symbolize concern about AIDS was conceived by artists who belong to a group called Visual Aids -- a whopping success by the standards of the new public art.    Programs like the one here in Chicago highlight many of the knotty questions that the new public art raises. The questions are not only about esthetics. They are also about the often fine line dividing exploitation and collaboration in the relationships between artists and their communities. Such programs raise the now inevitable questions about public financing, too: Would the money be better spent on established social programs, not to mention art that aspires to something more visually ambitious than a leafy vegetable?   How, in fact, do you compare a leafy vegetable with a park designed by Vito Acconci, much less with a Titian? For that matter, how do you compare the social service provided by these art projects with the work done by real social service organizations?   AND HOW DO YOU COMPARE SUCH projects even with the political art that filled the last Whitney Biennial and the Aperto at the Venice Biennale? An essential element distinguishes this new public art from much of what was on view in New York and Italy: it eschews galleries and museums, where such art often takes on a boutiquish odor. The work may stem from the same ideas and idealism that inspire artists to make sculptures and installations for more conventional sites, but it takes those ideas in a different direction. It is not primarily about addressing the traditional art public and its debates over quality.   What may come to mind is the recent brouhaha involving three artists in Southern California who doled out $10 bills to undocumented migrant workers. By all accounts, that publicity stunt masquerading as art had nothing to do with serious collaboration between the artists and the workers; both as social service and as a meditation on the problems at the Mexican-American border it was laughably meager. Its real audience was the art world and its critics, among whom the gesture of giving away public money for the arts had precisely the intended incendiary effect. Had it not provoked a response from that group, the whole gesture would have been, on the face of it, empty.   One can think of that California project as the new public art at its worst. But much of the new public art is different. It almost always derives from good intentions. Of course, the streets of Chicago's West Side are paved with them.   Some of the \\"Culture in Action\\" projects are examples of such well-intended duds. Suzanne Lacy, who for years has been putting together spectacles and performances that involve large groups of people, organized one of the most disappointing and tradition-bound projects with a group of women from around the city. The group drew up a list of 100 local women of distinction, dead and alive, chosen from more than 400 nominations solicited through newspapers and women's organizations; then limestone rocks, each embedded with a brass plate bearing the name of one of the women, were distributed around the Loop.    The impulse to recognize the achievements of these mostly unheralded women was admirable. But the rocks, with their small and difficult-to-read plaques, turn out to be undistinguished testimonials to distinguished women, clunky obstacles on busy streets where they may be likelier to annoy than to enlighten passers-by. As to an even more questionable component of Ms. Lacy's project, a dinner party to which Gloria Steinem, Anita Hill and a small group of other prominent women have been invited, it is difficult to see why such a private event, oddly caricaturing Caryl Churchill's caustic 1983 play, \\"Top Girls,\\" should be underwritten by a public art program (even if it is videotaped for outsiders to see).   Another dubious project involved the artists Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler, who asked a group of residents of Ogden Courts Apartments, a housing project, to help them design a paint chart, each color relating to some event in the history of public housing or some aspect of life in such housing -- Urban Renewal Lime, Cabrini Green, Pruitt-Igoe Dust. (It is being distributed in paint stores.)    Some Ogden Courts residents, Ms. Jacob volunteered, wondered quite understandably what possible benefit they derived from contributing to this artsy exercise, especially one that reduced catastrophes like Pruitt-Igoe to something as decorous as a wall coloring. It was agreed that after completing the chart, Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler would collaborate with the residents on thinking up something more to the point.   Yet another well-meaning but fuzzily conceived project is by a quartet of artists who call themselves Haha. In a storefront in Rogers Park, near Evanston, they have joined a group of residents and others to create a hydroponic garden. The aim is to make the storefront a meeting place for AIDS volunteers and people interested in discussing AIDS, the garden becoming both a source of therapeutic food for people with AIDS and a metaphor for nurturing and caring.   The artists in Haha are sensitive people dealing with an immense problem about which they are trying, as artists, to make some constructive statement. But with all the serious work to be done and already being done by volunteer AIDS organizations, the project seems hopelessly precious, not to say ineffectual. The garden is too small to be much of a contribution, and in any case, its physiological benefits are questionable. And where is the art in all this? As metaphor, the garden is trite. As interior design, the storefront is unexceptional. Surely this can't be described as good Performance or Process Art, either, even by the most generous definitions of those terms.   SO WHAT ARE THE BEST OF THE \\"Culture in Action\\" projects? A local artist named Inigo Manglano-Ovalle organized a block party on Erie Street near Wood Street in West Town, collaborating over many months with children and teen-agers, gangs, and community organizations. For the party, which took place late last month, more than 70 video monitors were set up along the street. They displayed videotapes of neighborhood residents made by the young people with whom Mr. Manglano-Ovalle collaborated. The young people were trained in the use of video; they decided on the subject matter of the tapes, and some of the equipment they used was contributed to the neighborhood after the project was finished so the young people could continue to make videos with it.   Gangs that usually fight over turf banded together for the party and for the supervision of the street. And where was the art here? In the more than 40 visually lively tapes made by the young people. In the theater of the party. And in the peculiarly artistic demonstration of community solidarity.   Another project was put together by Daniel J. Martinez, the artist responsible for the notorious \\"I Can't Imagine Ever Wanting to Be White\\" buttons at the Whitney Biennial. For \\"Culture in Action\\" he did something as sensitive and upbeat as the buttons were crude and off-putting. He spent around two years enlisting 800 volunteers from Mexican-American and black neighborhoods that don't generally mix with each other. The group organized a colorful, costume-filled parade that moved from one neighborhood to the other, stopping in between at Maxwell Street. Like Mr. Manglano-Ovalle's project, this was an artistic, theatrical illustration of community organization and embrace.   At the same time, Mr. Martinez created an installation on a fenced-in lot near Maxwell Street that is owned by the University of Illinois at Chicago, which is trying to drive out the market. The installation (done without the university's involvement) consists of a platform made from giant granite blocks. The blocks come from a plaza that the university designed during the mid-60's for its campus several blocks away.   That plaza partook of the sort of now discredited liberal design mentality of the time that obliterated old neighborhoods and replaced them with housing projects. Its destruction, and the use of its remains on the disputed site of an old neighborhood that the university asserts it will improve by eliminating is thus full of reverberations and double-entendres. The platform Mr. Martinez has created also suggests a giant soapbox, a place for speakers to exhort crowds. His sentiments are clearly with one side. But his spare installation avoids preaching and, like good political art, aims at provoking serious debate without pretending to be able to effect major change.   There are obviously plenty of pitfalls with the new public art. One of the most dangerous, condescending assumptions that can underlie it is ghettoization under the guise of public outreach -- that art for lower-income communities, immigrant communities, must take the form of social activism, that the history of Western culture as presented in museums is irrelevant to such people.   Yet another danger -- perhaps an inevitability -- is that such projects as \\"Culture in Action\\" will be imitated by every arts organization that wants to seem trendy and politically correct, turning what should be painstaking and long-term community involvement into the quick-hit, radical-chic, plop art of the 90's. Fly in the artists, stage an event with the city's downtrodden, alert the media! Ms. Jacob says she has already received calls from organizations around the country that would like her to put together in their cities something similar to what she put together in Chicago. No wonder she is reluctant to speak of paradigms.

Rescuers improvised, sending a steel cage along the cable to bring some passengers to safety, and using a basket slung from an 18-story construction crane to evacuate the rest.    Behind the News -- The tramway was built by a Swiss company, and always seemed like it would be more at home in the Alps than shuttling people between Manhattan and Roosevelt Island. With the opening of a subway stop on the island in the late 80's the tram had become even more of a quaint relic. The breakdown, apparently caused by an electrical surge, was nearly complete: both the main power system and a backup failed. Equipment for a second backup system has been out of service for more than 18 months and won't be repaired until August -- the equipment is so old that replacement parts are not available","excerpt":"they have to be made.

RHODE ISLAND    The News -- The 66-year-old Jamestown Bridge, which crosses Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, was demolished. Its concrete piers will be dumped at sea to form reefs.    Behind the News -- The two-lane bridge had been closed for more than a decade since a modern four-lane bridge had been built alongside. Narrow, steep, high and with steel grates for a road surface, the old bridge provided a harrowing driving experience, particularly in the rain. The demolition was a reminder of how much highway and bridge design has improved. It was a reminder of other changes as well: the demolition and reef building will cost at least $16 million, five times more than it cost to build the bridge in 1940.    UNITED NATIONS    The News -- The director of a plan to renovate the United Nations complex said the United States was causing delays that were jeopardizing the $1.6 billion project.    Behind the News -- The 55-year-old headquarters, including the Secretariat, a glass-sided slab designed by Le Corbusier, among others, has been in need of restoration for years. Heating and electrical systems are obsolete, roofs leak and asbestos insulation and lead paint create health hazards. Under the seven-year restoration plan, United Nations operations would move into a temporary conference hall and into office space in midtown. But the United States, long concerned about United Nations spending, has blocked approval of $100 million for the project, questioning whether the amount is needed right now.    IRAQ    The News -- Iraqi and United Nations officials are working, slowly, to restore Babylon, the ancient Mesopotamian city on the Euphrates.    Behind the News -- The Iraq war is just the latest in a long line of conflicts that have brought suffering to the city, home to the Hanging Gardens and other wonders. But the area is relatively peaceful these days, with American troops expected to leave soon for Baghdad, 60 miles to the north. So officials are seeking international donations to turn Babylon into a cultural center. But nature, as well as war, has taken its toll.

Simmons will have the surgery today to repair torn cartilage he suffered during Monday morning's workout. A test Tuesday revealed the tear. Simmons was the 15th player selected in the draft and had been slotted to start at left outside linebacker.   \\"It'll set him back a little bit, certainly,\\" Holmgren said. \\"But we're talking four to six weeks and he'll be back in there at the beginning of the season.\\"   In Simmons's absence, the Packers will start Jeff Brady, a third-year man. A knee injury limited him to 8 games and 18 tackles last year. (AP) San Francisco 49ers    What is a trip to a foreign land for his teammates is a homecoming of sorts for the San Francisco 49ers' offensive tackle James Parrish.   Parrish, a veteran of the Barcelona Dragons of the World League of American Football and now struggling to win a spot on the 49ers, said he was mobbed by young autograph-seekers during an evening walk on the Ramblas, the city's jammed promenade.   \\"It's great, I'm just glad to be back in the city and see some of my old friends,\\" Parrish said before the 49ers and Pittsburgh Steelers scrimmaged at a practice for their American Bowl game in Barcelona, Spain, on Sunday.   \\"All the guys on the team know I played here and know the city and the people -- and my Spanish is pretty fluent,\\" said Parrish, who played for the Dragons before the W.L.A.F. folded after the 1992 season. Parrish was cut last season by San Diego after he spent the 1991 season on Miami's \\"physically unable to perform list.\\" (AP) Miami Dolphins    At first it looked as if it were just another scuffle during two-a-day drills in Davie, Fla. Hot, tired and suddenly angry, Huey Richardson reached out and grabbed offensive guard Charles Hope's face mask. Then Richardson ripped it off, and the message was clear -- he'll fight to keep his career alive.   Richardson, a former Florida Gators star, is trying to win a job at defensive end with the Miami Dolphins, his fourth team in three years. He was a bust with the Pittsburgh Steelers, who made him the 15th player selected in the 1991 draft. The Washington Redskins and Jets waived him last year. In two seasons, he made seven tackles.   \\"I had the opportunity at those other places","excerpt":"they just didn't pan out,\\" said Richardson, 25. \\"My dad always told me that adversity builds character, so I guess I'm getting a lot of character.\\" (AP) Cincinnati Bengals    David Klingler, Cincinnati's starter in his second pro season, says he isn't worried about Jay Schroeder taking his job. Klingler, last year's first-round draft pick, said he welcomes the experience Schroeder and quarterbacks coach Ken Anderson have to offer.   \\"If anything, having Jay there takes off the pressure,\\" said Klingler, who has played in four N.F.L. games, compared with 100 for Schroeder. \\"With Kenny, now you have two guys back there with a lot to offer.\\"   Schroeder, once the starter for Washington and the Los Angeles Raiders, played for the 1987 Super Bowl champion Redskins. He came to the Bengals as an unrestricted free agent, signing a two-year contract for up to $3 million, but was told he would be Klingler's backup.   \\"In the back of my mind, I'm thinking I could go 16 weeks and not get a shot,\\" Schroeder said. \\"But I've got to be prepared. That's the only way I can treat it. I've seen it happen for nine years. It's tough to go through a whole season with one quarterback.

The team physician, Dr. Gary Losse, repaired two ligaments and a tendon that Byrd, 32, tore when he apparently caught his cleats in the grass and fell during a non-contact, one-on-one drill Tuesday afternoon.

They take so much electronic gear that schools have to rewire the dormitories. They are the audience of the future, and to the presenters of classical music they must look like the audience from hell. The feeling is mutual. If the students I teach are representative, their generation sees classical music as alien territory.    Last year I asked a clsss of 30 bright undergraduates what it would take to get them to a symphony concert or the opera. Answer: neither wild horses, nor cash bribes, not even higher grades would suffice. Yet as they discussed the question, it turned out that these students, who use terms like \\"culturally constructed\\" and \\"de-centered subject\\" with ease and some accuracy, don't dislike classical music","excerpt":"they just don't know it. Thanks to the gutting of secondary-school music programs, few of them have played in bands or orchestras. Many of my students have never even heard Beethoven's Fifth, though they do like it when I play it for them. The main obstacle, they say, to enjoying a live classical concert is the acoustic ambience, totally different from the intense amplification of the rock, jazz or even folk concerts they attend. The Decibel Gap, not the music, keeps them from the symphony or the opera.    For my students loudness is a form in intimacy. They like music that hugs the body. At rock concerts they stand right in front of the speakers, but at the symphony they can't hear the music. Even if they have not suffered hearing loss they can't follow the changing dynamic level typical of orchestral music. The music seems unfocused,lost and far away. And in this dark age of acoustic engineering, it often is.    Last May I took my 12-year-old son to a recital by Yo-Yo Ma and Jeffrey Kahane at the hall normally used by the Oregon Symphony. We sat up in the balcony, half a city block from the performers. I could follow the music only because I knew it. My son drifted off. On the drive home he asked, \\"Why is it more enjoyable to listen to music on the car radio than in the concert hall?\\" He had a point. It is thrilling to hear acoustic music resonate in a great hall like the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, but in most concert halls the acoustic sound is uneven and masked, not spacious but distant. I often wonder why Indian musicians, whose tradition is so much older and more \\"natural\\" than ours, have no qulams abut amplifying their performances.     With opera, the Tech Gap compounds the Decibel Gap. My students find opera impossible to hear and absurd to watch. Opera has long been the art form American kids love to hate, but the problem today isn't ridculous plots and overweight singers in silly costumes. It's the tacky, low-tech production, unworthy of a third-rate rock show. My students are surprised that such a prestigious art form should be so primitive technically. Even the most elaborate Zeffirelli productions broadcast live from the Metropolitan lack visual flair compared to MTV. Studnets say they look \\"chessy.\\"    Allan Bloom may despair of the musical taste of the young, but my students, though they have much to learn, are not brain-damaged victims of rock music and mass culture. They love to listen to music, and the love to play music, classical as well as rock. Last year a group of them gave a stylish staging of Bach's \\"Coffee Cantata,\\" to cheers from their fellow students. But like past generations of Ameircan undergraduates, who idolized the Casa Loma Orchestra or the Dave Brubeck Quartet (no one ever claimed that undergraduates were infallible), they define themselves by their taste in contemporary pop music, which, in their case, is eclectic, ethnic and goofy. They like two Bay Area groups: Zulu Spear and the New Klezmer Trio. They like Sun Ra, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and the World Saxaphone Quartet. They like Tom Waits, the Tone Dogs of Seattle and Naked City of New York.    The common element in their taste is a nostalgia for the avant-garde of the late 60's - before they were born. My students find modernism baffling and Minimalism passe, and they aren't knowledgeable enough to catch the stylistic allusions of postmodernism. But they know the music of Jimi Hendrix and John Coltrane inside out. They know who engineered \\"Electric Lady Land,\\" they can sing \\"A Love Supreme,\\" and they are authorities on Frank Zappa and King Crimson. When they hear comtemporary concert music, they feel right at home with Karkheinz Stockhausen's \\"Donnerstag\\" and Witol Lutoslawski's String Quartet, espeically in the supercharged recording by the Kronos Quartet. They like music that is visceral and visionary - and loud.    These qualities, however, are not unique to recent music. Fifteen years or so from now, when they find themselves aghast at the musical tastes of their children, my students will turn to the music of Beethoven and Wagner and Stravinsky for the same kicks they now get from N.W.A. and John Zorn. Classical music is safe for another generation, as long as it is heard on state-of-the-art sound system and viewed on a life-size monitor.

And he was talking about Expressionism and punk rock.   ''The thing that always attracted me to Expressionism in painting wasn't the technique,'' he said. ''It was the expressive quality on the canvas. That's what I thought of when these punk bands started coming along in the late 70's.

The Scarsdale Historical Society's \\"Portrayal of Farm Animals in Art\\" is, therefore, timely, abounding as it does in these creatures and in wildlife. too. Still, the hundred or more images in the show add up not to a Christmas anthology (there are neither reindeer nor robins), but rather to an impression of a time when man and mammal were on more intimate terms. In the past, people in Westchester and similar communities either owned farms or worked on them","excerpt":"they knew the pigs that their bacon came from.   An eloquent symbol of this closeness is the circa 1860 picture of a prize cow on its way to market in Philadelphia. Standing between two men, it is a black monster with white socks and a dewlap like a misplaced rudder. There is a barn behind, flying the flag, and the inscription reads: \\"Painted correctly before slaughtering by the celebrated artist, Alexander Boudrou.\\" If the apprehensive look on the cow's face is any clue, Boudrou was indeed the executioner as well as the painter.    This is a bestiary rich -- perhaps too rich -- in bovines, many of them depicted in early to mid-19th-century colored lithographs. Devon Reds stand on American soil, but this being an international event brown Alderneys pose on their owner's estate in (old) Jersey and Ayrshires with strangely elongated bodies stand in the Scottish county for which they were named.    As for Paulus Potter's young bullock with sheep and, in the foreground, a frog, they are unmistakably at home in Lowland landscape. A small brown canvas, it is dated 1647, the year that the Dutch artist, then 22 years old, produced his famous life-size \\"Bull.\\" The mostly shapely bovines, however, are the papier-mache cow and calf that once served as a pull toy.   Sheep get a share of the attention -- the lithograph of a Vermont farmer's Spanish merinos wearing their black fleeces as loose as Shar-pei dogs wear their coats and a ram weathervane are noteworthy examples.   Horses go from one on rockers that should have been put out to grass long ago to the scrawny nags in 17th century, possibly Dutch engravings and the three harnessed to a phaeton in a Currier and Ives lithograph. They and their barely visible driver are crashing a toll gate much to the consternation of the toll takers and the cat that is scaling the roof of the toll house. This early form of hot rodding dates back to the Regency era when rich young bucks prided themselves on taking five-bar gates much as the talking car levitates in television's \\"Knight Rider.\\"   Not to be missed is the Andrew Wyeth watercolor of four horses outside a derelict house and one inside, poking its head through an open door.    All of the foregoing are displayed in the society's meetinghouse premises, along with a caseful of pottery animals. The most fetching of these is a Meissen figurine of a peasant girl feeding hens and chickens, although it has a rival in a brown-speckled Bennington Ware cat. Also in this section is an inlaid cabinet with simulated ormolu. A Baroque design that is dated circa 1865 but looks younger, it has on its door a complex inlay of a maiden giving milk to a fawn and on adjoining panels an emblem involving a ladder, a bucket, ears of grain and so forth.   Continuing in the Cudner-Hyatt House next door, the exhibition goes in all directions. At one extreme is a wooden sign advertising in red and white \\"Fat Pigs\\" and \\"Backon,\\" at the other is RCA's \\"Nipper,\\" lifesize in plaster or papier-mache. In between are prints labeled \\"Mixed Critters,\\" including a 19th-century engraving of a boar that is a caricature of obesity, and a 20th-century etching of a woman in a stable milking a goat that stands on a table.   More memorable, though, is the colored engraving (1808) of a \\"common mouse\\" that is uncommon for seeming the size of a hippopotamus in relation to the table behind it. Proportions are a problem for many of the artists in this show but not for John James Audubon, whose common mice scamper over cheese on a plate beside a Chinese blue and white ginger jar, a print that is in the first half of the display.    The Cudner-Hyatt is a worthy setting for a Beatrix Potter tale but its show includes few allusions to the great animalier -- some ceramics and one of her books. Then again, there are compensations like the anonymous papier-mache hen surrounded by wooden eggs and the naive charcoal drawing of a barnyard scene. A riveting detail in this is the horse that stands at a stable door pressing its face against the wall as if suffering from a headache.   The society can always be counted on for fascinating miscellanies and this one is no exception. But it is not as well balanced as previous efforts and, larger than usual, it seems repetitious. For every exceptional item like the needlepoint picture of David and Abigail (circa 1650) there seem to be two or three nonentities -- Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait's uncomfortably photographic painting of sheep in Yonkers (1904) is an example.   A show drawn largely from private galleries, it continues through March 3. The society is at 937 White Plains Post Road (at Boulevard). Its hours are 1:30 to 4:30 P.M.
