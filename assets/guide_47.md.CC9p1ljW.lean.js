The setting is cheery, with bright yellow walls and flowery banquettes, and the staff is congenial. The menu features a mix of salads, sandwiches, pastas and light entrees. Virtually everything is pleasing, from the simple endive, radicchio and arugula salad tossed in a good balsamic vinaigrette to the cold antipasto plate holding wide rounds of Genoa salami, rich provolone, perfectly marinated artichoke hearts, just-ripe tomato, salty olives, prosciutto and arugula. You can't go wrong with sandwiches like turkey and Black Forest ham on crusty white bread, and the pastas -- like the linguine verdura with oil, garlic, broccoli, mushrooms and zucchini -- are simple and fresh. ($25 and Under: 5/ 27/94)  HURRICANE ISLAND ++  (212) 717-6600; 1303 Third Avenue, near 75th Street; $; all major cards    If you are in the mood for lobster, Hurricane Island (named for an island off Camden, Me.) is a good place to try. Lobsters here are meaty, sweet and flavorful, not to mention reasonably priced. The barroom sports nautical accoutrements and historical photographs of the real island; in the informal back dining room, the tables are draped with black-and-white-checked cloths. One might begin with a tasty New England fish chowder with chunks of cod and a taste of anise; full-flavored Manhattan clam chowder; plump pan-fried oysters on a bed of greens, and succulent roasted mussels in a white wine, lemon and tomato broth. For the main event, steamed lobsters usually range from one and a half to four pounds, and come with excellent cole slaw and sweet potato fries. Other preparations include a warm, peppery lobster salad with arugula and black beans; grilled tuna steak with wasabi, and grilled salmon on a bed of lentils. For non-seafood eaters, there is a good steak, tasty and tender.

But the transformation of the borough's restaurant scene has spawned Brooklyn's own Zagat guide and a number of relatively new places that have earned at least one star from The New York Times.    BLUE RIBBON SUSHI  * [Rating: One Star]  (718) 840-0408","excerpt":"278 Fifth Avenue (First Street), Park Slope; $$$; Review: 4/2/03.  Park Slope has its own version of SoHo's Blue Ribbon Sushi. The menu is extensive and varied, with a permanent sushi list of about 35 fish, supplemented by a daily list of market specials.    CONVIVIUM OSTERIA  * [Rating: One Star]  (718) 857-1833; 68 Fifth Avenue (St. Mark's Place), Park Slope; $$$; Review: 10/6/04.  Convivium Osteria, on the fringes of Park Slope, marries Italian and Portuguese dishes and throws in Spanish dishes for good measure. Dishes include salted codfish fillets, pasta dishes, grilled baby octopus, seafood tapas and an enormous, terrific ribeye for two.    THE GROCERY  * [Rating: One Star]  (718) 596-3335; 288 Smith Street (Union Street), Carroll Gardens; $$; Review: 7/19/00.  The Grocery is a focused, high-quality restaurant that can rise to heights that make it much more than a nice neighborhood spot. The menu avoids the standard lineup of steak, chicken and salmon. Instead, the market-inspired selection includes highlights like striped bass braised with salsify; English pea flan; sugar snaps and basil; and a vegetarian tasting plate of market greens and vegetables with grains and legumes.    ICI  * [Rating: One Star]  (718) 789-2778; 246 De Kalb Avenue (Vanderbilt Avenue), Fort Greene; $$; Review: 7/21/04.  A tall maple tree shades the Brooklyn backyard garden of this sweet restaurant full of unpretentious pleasures. Its menu is brief, with about eight appetizers and eight entrees like wilted dandelion salad with an organic poached egg, bacon and anchovy cream; and roasted lamb with a bulgur wheat salad.    STONE PARK CAFE  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (718) 369-0082; 324 Fifth Avenue (Third Street), Park Slope; $$; Review 3/30/05.  The cooking at Stone Park is careful, and the flourishes and grace notes are prudent. Among the appetizers are plenty of unexpected dishes and dishes with clever twists, like bluefish cakes garnished with a fantastic slaw that uses celery root in place of cabbage.    TEMPO  * [Rating: One Star]  (718) 636-2020; 256 Fifth Avenue (Carroll Street), Park Slope; $$; Review: 11/10/04.  That Tempo opened quietly last year speaks loudly about the evolution of Brooklyn's dining scene, because this restaurant, which serves Mediterranean fare, is worth a bit of talk. Pasta dishes, especially bucatini with a pignoli-pistachio pesto, are winners.
