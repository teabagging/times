George Montgomery and Mona Freeman are the hapless stars of this thoroughly standard little melodrama, plunked down in the Philippine guerrilla country as an excuse for some bloody shenanigans straight out of the Old West. Or so it would seem.Producer Collier Young obviously went to a good deal of trouble in herding his little cast southward, where the entire venture was photographed. But whatever the merits of a novel that author Stirling Silliphant has adapted, the plot is a tired and unconvincing one. As for the background, the sinister native uprisings against the white settlers in 1951, only the scenery seems real.Paying customers who go in wondering just what the title means, and what prompted a terrible conflict, will leave the same way. Sharp-eyed patrons may even spot the course of action in the first sequence, after a plane deposits the derelict hero in Manila.When a big, brash, fine-looking fellow like Mr. Montgomery starts leering at the lovely Miss Freeman, a friend's wife, will the blood-thirsty natives conveniently cancel out the husband (John Baer)? And will the selfish hero turn noble and almost single-handedly save an entire community from massacre? Yep.Only in the impassive sincerity of a native soldier, Ben Perez, is the heart of the conflict realistically touched upon. And for a grown man who has knocked around plenty, Mr. Montgomery's hero, with a tiresome flow of stale slang, behaves more like a spoiled adolescent. John Barnwell has carelessly directed a picture that remains carefully uninspired.
