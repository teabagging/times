Mr. Hun Sen, who denied that his actions amounted to a coup, accused Prince Ranariddh of illegal acts and wanted him replaced. It was unclear whether the armed confrontation had ended. Prince Ranariddh was abroad, but his party officials said they had not given up.   A1    Caribbean Weighs Tie to Britain  Across the English-speaking Caribbean, from Barbados to Jamaica, rising dissatisfaction with the handling of death-row cases is leading Governments to weigh proposals to eliminate formal ties to the British legal system.   A1    Body May Be Drug Lord  The Mexican Government said there were indications that the body of a man who died after plastic surgery was that of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the billionaire drug trafficker. Although the Government would not completely confirm the drug lord's death, initial tests on the cadaver showed a matching identity.   A1    Violence in Northern Ireland  The annual march of the Orange Order, a Protestant group, went ahead in a Roman Catholic neighborhood of Northern Ireland after weeks of Government efforts to find a compromise. The police dragged Catholic protesters from the road to clear the way for the parade, and incidents of violence erupted throughout Northern Ireland in response to the decision to allow the march.   A3    Pile-Up Kills 62 in Sudan  Sixty-two people were killed and 30 seriously injured in a highway pile-up south of Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, state-run television reported. It said a pick-up truck had tried to overtake another car near Kamlin, about 60 miles southeast of the capital, but collided with an oncoming passenger bus and a truck, setting them on fire. Local people tried to put out the blaze with dust and water, as there was no fire station in the area. (Agence France-Presse)     Bomb Planted in Moscow  An underground Communist group tried to blow up an enormous statue of Peter the Great in Moscow in a protest over a proposal to remove Lenin's body from its mausoleum in Red Square for burial elsewhere, Russian news agencies said. The group, which calls itself the Revolutionary Military Council, said it had planted a bomb but did not detonate it to prevent injuring passers-by. The police defused the device. (Agence France-Presse)     Crackdown in Pakistan  In a citywide sweep in Karachi, Pakistan, the police arrested 220 people suspected of involvement in a wave of ethnic killings that have left at least 150 people dead in recent months. (AP)    Historic Voting in Mexico  In San Juan Chamula in the state of Chiapas and across Mexico, voting took place in an election managed for the first time by an autonomous Federal elections council brought about by a reform led by President Ernesto Zedillo. In the race for mayor of Mexico City, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, an opposition candidate, claimed victory.   A1    NATIONAL   A8-13, B8    Sojourner Begins a Survey Of Rocks and Soil on Mars   The Sojourner, the first mobile explorer of another planet, began prospecting the soil and rocks of Mars and transmitting a flood of data to overjoyed scientists. The roving vehicle pressed the head of one of its scientific instruments to the powdery surface near the Mars Pathfinder and made history as it recorded the surface chemistry.   A1    NASA's administrator said the decision on whether to send a replacement NASA astronaut to Russia's troubled Mir space station in September would rest on whether the assignment was judged to be safe and productive.   A9      The Hiring of John Huang  Congressional investigators say President Clinton took a personal interest in the hiring of John Huang, a fund-raiser whose activities are a central focus of the inquiry into campaign financing improprieties, by the Democratic National Committee, going so far as to ask the committee's finance chairman whether Mr. Huang would be hired. Former party officials have told investigators that in the two months leading up to that conversation, top officials at the White House had strongly urged the Democratic National Committee to hire Mr. Huang so he could begin soliciting contributions from Asian-Americans.   A1      A senior Republican Senator investigating campaign-finance abuses urged President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to testify before the Senate committee that begins its televised hearings on Tuesday.   B8     Building in Reagan's Honor   The Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center is about to be completed on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. Among Federal buildings, the complex is second in size only to the Pentagon. Some say the Reagan Building will save the Government money because $2.2 billion has been spent in rent in the last 60 years to house the Federal offices that will move there.   A10     Minister and Poor Against City  A flamboyant preacher who favors suspenders and a tie emblazoned with the American flag and the Statue of Liberty goes on trial in Buena Park, Calif., for letting homeless people camp in the parking lot of his First Southern Baptist Church. He faces a maximum of four and a half years in jail for nine misdemeanor charges.   A13      NEW YORK/REGION   B1-7    Taking on Soft Money With New Campaign Rules   New York City officials are applying new rules intended to limit the influence of unregulated political contributions, known as soft money, in the mayoral race. Records show soft money was more widespread in the last mayoral race than was previously known and suggest it may be hard to curb fund-raising and spending that tries to get around the limits set by the city's Campaign Finance Board.   B1      A Local March for Hong Kong   Chinese-Americans marched through downtown Manhattan to celebrate the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule. Recent immigrants displayed their affinity to events in China, but protesters in Times Square complained of lingering human-rights abuses in China, cried out for democratic reforms, and said the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule meant more people would come under the control of a corrupt, tyrannical system.   B3      Cosby Extortion Trial Opens  A trial will open in Manhattan Federal Courthouse for a woman accused of extorting $40 million from Bill Cosby by claiming to be his out-of-wedlock daughter. In pretrial hearings, her lawyers have signaled that they will focus on her belief that he was her father and thus was negotiating her rights as a daughter.   B1      Debate on Cameras in Court  A debate has erupted in Albany over whether New York should alter or keep its law permitting television cameras in courtrooms, which is considered among the most restrictive in the nation. Some would like to ban television entirely from courtrooms. Others, represented largely by news organizations, like Court TV, want to televise most courtroom proceedings if not all of them. The law gives judges the authority to bar cameras from courtrooms or shield certain witnesses from being filmed while on the stand.   B4      SPORTSMONDAY   C1-9     Fourth Wimbledon for Sampras  Pete Sampras won his fourth Wimbledon championship in five years and his 10th career title in a Grand Slam event, leaving him just two trophies shy of the record. His virtuoso performance against 44th-ranked Cedric Pioline of France demonstrated a perfect and continually perfected grass-court technique.

The pageantry around the death of the pope began with a huge public Mass in St. Peter's Square and then the first rites of John Paul's funeral.   A1    The next pope faces challenges so urgent that many church leaders and analysts worry that even a pope with the charisma and capacity of John Paul II will have to resort to a strategy of triage.   A1    Italy remembered Pope John Paul II formally and officially for his role as the leader of the Catholic Church. Rome's teeming Catholic immigrant community bid an intensely personal goodbye to the man who many said had transformed their lives.   A1    The power structure that governed the Roman Catholic hierarchy for the past 26 years has fallen away. At the moment of Pope John Paul II's death, an ultraconservative 78-year-old Spanish cardinal temporarily became the leading decision-maker in Catholicism.   A13    Pope John Paul II, in the final hours of his life, lay serene, visitors said, in the expectation that he soon would be in heaven. Interviews with visitors to the pope's bedside and Vatican reports portray him as tranquil and comfortable in the face of death.   A12    Arab news cameras and reporters joined the throng focused on St. Peter's Square. Satellite channels are working to be more competitive in covering non-Arab issues.   A14    Timetable on Syrian Withdrawal  A United Nations envoy said Syria's leaders had promised to pull out all of their military and intelligence forces from Lebanon by the end of the month, before the nationwide elections scheduled for the end of May. The withdrawal of Syrian forces is one of the central demands of the Lebanese opposition.   A1    Kashmir Transport Threatened  Bus service across divided Kashmir is about to resume, and threats from militant groups operating on the Indian side of the disputed territory have begun to sow fear among would-be passengers. Indian security forces have promised to fortify protection.   A4    Assyrian New Year Sanctioned  Thousands of Assyrians have converged to openly celebrate their new year in Turkey for the first time. The Assyrian New Year, like many other expressions of minority ethnic identity, had been seen by Turkey as a threat. But this year, the government, with an eye toward helping its bid to join the European Union, has officially allowed the celebration.   A6    Iraqi Assembly Appointments  The Iraqi national assembly appointed a speaker and two deputy speakers, taking the first step, though a largely symbolic one, toward installing a new government. The leaders of the top political parties settled on a prominent Sunni Arab and the minister of industry in the interim government as speaker.   A11    NATIONAL   A16-20    A New Brand of Tutoring Grows Largely Unchecked  Propelled by the No Child Left Behind law, the federally financed tutoring industry has doubled in size in each of the last two years, with the potential to become a $2 billion-a-year enterprise, according to market analysts. It is virtually without regulation, causing concern among school districts, elected officials and some industry executives.   A1    Giving Year for Charities  Giving by foundations hit a record last year thanks to gains in asset values and a stream of gifts from philanthropists. An estimated $32.4 billion spilled out of the nation's roughly 66,000 independent, community and corporate foundations in 2004, according to estimates to be released by the Foundation Center.   A16    Lobbying on Medicare Cuts  Doctors are mobilizing a nationwide lobbying campaign to stave off cuts in their Medicare fees as Congress hunts for ways to rein in the soaring cost of the insurance program. Medicare will cut payments to doctors by 4 percent to 5 percent in each of the next six years, Bush administration officials say.   A20    Suit Over Same-Sex Benefits  Michigan has become the focus of attention with the filing of a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union in which 21 same-sex couples ask the state courts to clarify whether a recent court ruling that gay and lesbian state workers should be ineligible for health benefits for their partners in future contracts means the loss of their benefits.   A16    Salinas Races to Save Library  Unless Salinas, California can raise $500,000, the John Steinbeck, Cesar Chavez and Gabilan Libraries will be shuttered, victims of the city's $9 million budget shortfall. Residents, writers and celebrities staged a read-in over the weekend.   A16    An Embattled Delicacy  Restaurants have removed foie gras from their menus because of protests by animal rights advocates, who say the techniques used to produce it should be outlawed. Opponents persuaded the California Legislature last year to pass a bill that will ban foie gras in 2012 unless producers can prove the technique is humane.   A17    SCIENCE/HEALTH    New Guidelines for Cancer Risk  The E.P.A. has issued new guidelines for determining whether a chemical causes cancer in humans. Agency officials say that they will take into account a larger array of scientific data before declaring that a substance has carcinogenic properties, a risk assessment that takes a step back from previous guidelines.   A20    Shuttle Concerns Resurface  As NASA races toward returning the shuttle fleet to space, some current and former employees are questioning how serious the space agency is about fixing the ''broken safety culture'' that investigators have said was a major cause of the loss of the Columbia and its crew two years ago.   A19    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-5    Prison Health Provider Is Blamed in Jail Suicide  David Pennington, an inmate on Rikers Island who committed suicide in July 2004, was yet another casualty of the sometimes deadly mistakes made by Prison Health Services, the Tennessee company hired to provide health care at Rikers, a report by state investigators says.   B1    Flooding in New Jersey  Flooding in northwestern New Jersey forced hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes as the latest rainstorm drenched the region, closing roads and prompting acting Gov. Richard J. Codey to declare a state of emergency. The rain also washed out several roads in upstate New York.   B3    City's Surfers Catch a Break  A two-jetty stretch of Rockaway Beach in Queens has been officially designated as a surfers-only beach, the first in New York.   B1    SPORTSMONDAY   D1-9    Mets Pitcher Remains Injured  Mets starting pitcher Kris Benson headed back to New York rather than to the team's next game in Cincinnati, due to a lingering pain in his right pectoral muscle. The departure marks the second time in five days Benson met with team doctors, and signals yet another flux in the Mets rotation, as well as the starting lineup.   D5    ARTS   E1-9    Italian Conductor Resigns  After weeks of vitriolic public wrangling, the renowned Italian conductor Riccardo Muti, who had been music director of the famous opera house Teatro Alla Scala for 19 years, gave in to the demands of the house's orchestra and workers, and announced his resignation.   E1    OBITUARIES   B7    Guenter Reimann  A Marxist economist early in his career who eventually published one of the most expensive and influential newsletters on international capitalism and monetary exchange, he was 100.   B7    BUSINESS DAY   C1-9    Fall of an Insurance Titan  Maurice R. Greenberg, former chairman and chief executive of American International Group, clung to the model of the imperial chief executive, steadfast in his belief that the market would lose faith in the company without him, his associates say. At a time when the iron-fisted corporate leader was increasingly being viewed as a liability, this attitude helped contribute to his downfall, they say.   C1    Vulnerability of College Data  Recent statistics and incidents are highlighting the vulnerabilities of modern universities to data theft. In California, for example, universities and colleges accounted for about 28 percent of all security breaches in that state since 2003 -- more than any other group.   C1    Schieffer Draws Praise  Leslie Moonves, the chairman of CBS, says he has been impressed with recent changes in the ''CBS Evening News'' that address what he has perceived to be some of the broadcast's most glaring shortcomings.

It's James Bond does the Tigris and Euphrates and it's what Middle East leaders are really talking about.         Scene One: Our story opens in Israel in February 1996, when the Turkish military's Deputy Chief of Staff, Cevik Bir, pays a secret visit to forge a military alliance with Shimon Peres. The deal calls for Israeli planes to practice in the open skies over Turkey and for Turkish planes to train over Israel. This gives Israel's air force its first staging area in Asia, from which it could outflank Syria and intimidate Iran. It gives the Turks a perfect way to squeeze Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, who has been providing a sanctuary for  Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdish Workers Party, the PKK, which has been fighting a bloody guerrilla war against the Turks from bases in Syria. Mr.  Assad keeps Mr. Ocalan around to prevent Turkey, which is building a dam on the  Euphrates, from choking off Syria's water supply.    Foreign Affairs","excerpt":"Turkish Delight"},{"year":"1993","title":"For centuries the water highways of Istanbul were the Bosporus, the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara. The grand boats of the sultan and his court mingled with ferries, fishermen and ships from all over the Ottoman Empire. Palaces were built along the shores. The rich, the powerful, the foreign diplomats lived (as some still do) in what was then the countryside, dotted with villages, along the Bosporus to escape the heat of summer in the city.\\n\\nFor the first time, the remaining architectural and historic treasures -- yalis, or country houses, even though most of them are surrounded by cities -- and the palaces are presented superbly in SPLENDORS OF ISTANBUL: Houses and Palaces Along the Bosporus (Abbeville, $67.50). To a lover of Istanbul, Francesco Venturi's photographs of the hidden city and the journalist Chris Hellier's text, with its mixture of gossip and architectural knowledge, are a revelation and a delight.

By the time the final curtain falls more than two hours later, blood has indeed been spilled, and so have guts, shameful secrets and a heap of dirt that stands for the stain on a family and a nation. That's the kind of play Mr. Tesich has written: one that tells you what it is going to do and then does it, messily perhaps, but with a vengeance and, once it finally gets going, with an inexorable grip.    It is also the kind of defiantly old-fashioned drama, big-boned, unsubtle and aflame with passion, that few writers as high-minded as Mr. Tesich, best known as the author of the film \\"Breaking Away,\\" would be caught dead writing anymore. There could be no more perfect setting for it than the Belasco Theater, a glorious old Broadway house that has known its own darkness more often than not in recent decades. David Belasco, the impresario and dramatist who built the place in 1907, believed in thunderous emotions, and his theater, an almost ecclesiastical cavern glinting with mosaics of colored glass, seems designed to showcase them.

In his often enormous close-ups of heads and in his more complex paintings of groups of people indoors or out, he has specialized in turning the scale, austere composition and all-over unity of Abstract Expressionism back toward reality, suffusing its formal advances with the facts of life and light and the actual experience of looking at the world.    This goal is even clearer in his current show at the Marlborough Gallery, which is dominated by landscapes devoid of people or faces. The best paintings among these 20 new canvases, most of which date from 1991 and '92, are big abbreviated images of trees or beaches, severely cropped or seen in close-up, and shown at different times of day or year.

He can transform a bunch of brown-paper shopping bags, some grease, a few clumps of hair from the floor of a barber shop, bits of broken records and some half-eaten spareribs into something as elegant and ornate as a Japanese kimono. Or into what resembles a folding fan. Or, in the case of \\"Bag Lady in Flight,\\" into what seems a tongue-in-cheek reference to Duchamp's \\"Nude Descending a Staircase.\\" He is a master of metamorphosis and rejuvenation.    The metamorphoses are not simply material, but also spiritual. Mr. Hammons's constructions suggest that even in the humblest objects, as in the most downtrodden people, there is to be found a rich and meaningful history. The traces may be hidden or disguised. They may emerge only when combined with other objects. His talent (not unlike the talent of a very different artist, Ilya Kabakov) involves unearthing these symbols and making these connections.

Peple's play, \\"A Pair of Sixes.\\" This film is fortunate in having in the leading rôles those competent actors, Frank Morgan and Charles Ruggles, who could do a great deal to make almost any comedy well worth a visit.This current Paramount attraction has some engaging melodies, which are rendered by several in the cast, including Messrs. Morgan and Ruggles. But it is the farcical incidents that make this feature a crackerjack warm weather entertainment rather than the musical compositions, for there is precious little reason, except possibly in one instance, for the characters lifting their voices in song.The bickering that goes on between T. Boggs Johns (Mr. Ruggles) and George Nettleton (Mr. Morgan) is a delight. They are partners in the feminine garter business and don't see eye to eye with each other as to how it should be run. Nettleton objects to Johns employing his nephew and Johns frowns upon the idea of Nettleton's niece coming to work as a stenographer. The romantic interest, as one might presume, is furnished by the niece and the nephew. As in the Potash and Perlmutter yarns they are permitted to enjoy the permission to wed only when the story is nearing its close.Cyrus Vanderholt, a legal light, suggests a poker hand of cards to determine which of the partners is to serve as the butler for the other for a year. The drawing of cards by the nervous men is highly amusing and it is a pair of sixes held by Nettleton that wins. So later one perceives Johns garbed as a butler for Nettleton, who insists upon the letter of the contract being adhered to. Johns is fined $100 for any breach of conduct, and it has further been agreed that if Mr. Johns fails to carry out the full term of the servitude he is to pay Nettleton $10,000.Polly Rockwell, played by Ginger Rogers, has a happy idea to end Mr. Johns's uncomfortable existence. She suggests to Johns, who as a butler is called Boggs, that he pretend to be filled with admiration for Mrs. Nettleton and also that he go about his duties with a smile. The notion upsets Mr. Nettleton's plans and he finds the shoe on the other foot when Johns one bright morning asks that he be permitted to serve an extra year as a butler.Fred Newmeyer, who directed several of Harold Lloyd's comedies, has handled the scenes of this production in an effective fashion. Virtually the only shortcoming to this bright nonsense was the fact that the vocal illusion in the early chapters yesterday afternoon was not always as good as it might have been.Miss Rogers does nicely by her rôle and Stanley Smith serves his part satisfactorily. The singing of these two is a good deal better than that in the average musical film. The performances of both Mr. Ruggles and Mr. Morgan, however, are something, to enthuse over.
