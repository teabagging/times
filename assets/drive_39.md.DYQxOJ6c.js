For this deadly serious and grim drama about a shocking and revolting crime committed by American G. I.'s against a local girl in an occupied German town, which opened at the Astor and Fine Arts Theatre yesterday, evokes both the varied meanings of justice and the callousness of man in a troubled society.\\"Town Without Pity,\\" let it be noted at the outset, is not a preachment or tract on the surface. Its underlying fault, it would appear to one observer, is in its ineffectiveness in projecting the anger and turmoil caused by such an explosive, scandalous occurrence. One is only made aware that the citizenry is not in revolt, but merely curious, pruriantly or otherwise. Its impact, therefore, is lessened to the point where, on occasion, it seems that the film, is simply a discussion of the fine points of the law and little else.This, however, is a minor point. The scenarists, producer-director Gottfried Reinhardt and a cast composed of Americans and Germans, acquit themselves in thoroughly admirable, natural fashion. The story evolves as authentically as the actual German locales at which it was filmed. The adult approach is evident in the presentation, which is neither black not white. Like life itself, \\"Town Without Pity\\" emerges as a study in grays. A 16-year-old, clad in the briefest of bikinis, has a spat with her 19-year-old boy friend. Moments later she is attacked and raped by four soldiers who are off-duty, drunk and with nothing but time on their hands.This would appear to be an open-and-shut case punishable, if the girl does not testify, by long prison terms. But circumstances alter the already horrible situation. The father of the youngster and the town's Mayor insist on a death penalty, and the assaulted girl will testify. This brings into play a tough Army defense attorney, who, while he is repelled by his clients' awful crime, is, nevertheless, bound to prove that they cannot be executed by a rope of circumstantial evidence.How this is achieved, as well as the film's tragic climax, is delineated with methodically effective technique. It is a searchingly careful method, executed largely without flamboyance. Our defender is a roughly-hewn citizen who knows his law but also is aware of human frailties. He pleads with the girl's parents to keep her off the stand. He demands that his clients tell their stories straight and without color, and he is willing to parry words and ideas about justice, Americans and Germans, people in general and the law with a cynical and suspicious female reporter for a scandal sheet, even if its upsets his mind and body.\\"Town Without Pity\\" does leave one with the idea that the law and, perhaps, justice, are strangely malleable. And Kirk Douglas, as the consistently harried defense attorney, does a remarkably restrained and strikingly professional job in the role of a man involved in a task that is thankless at best.Christine Kaufmann, as the ill-fated, ruined girl in the case, who is found to be less than the perfect child her parents imagine her to be, contributes a beautifully shaded stint in a role calling for nuances of feeling and delivery. Credit Hans Nielsen with an equally deeply-felt portrayal of the father, who is shocklingly exposed to the fact that his daughter is not a paragon of all the virtues, and that vengeance is not the answer to all crimes.Gerhart Lippert is fine as Fraeulein Kaufmann's confused and loving boy friend, and Robert Blake, too, as the most disturbed of the four G. I.'s. His buddies in crime, Richard Jaeckel, Frank Sutton and Mal Sondock","excerpt":"Barbara Rutting, as the overly curious reporter; Barbara van Bergen, as a helpful tart, and E. B. Marshall, as the sincere prosecuting officer, give glints of reality to the film. And Mr. Reinhardt's meticulous direction stamps \\"Town Without Pity\\" as hard-hitting, realistic and often memorable drama.

James DePreist conducted the orchestra with mixed but generally pleasing results. His account of the Barber, though on the brisk side, was a picture of lucidity. Details that are usually obscured -- fleeting brass effects, inner wind lines -- were spotlighted without being given an unnatural prominence. And the solo woodwind lines that weave through the essay, and also the Berlioz, were shapely and characterful and did double duty in elucidating the essay's charms and reminding listeners of one of the Philharmonic's strengths.

It is in the northern suburb of Carmel. A second is to open within the city in February and land is being purchased for a third.\\n\\nDesigned for extended stays, all Studio Plus rooms have one double bed, a kitchenette with a microwave oven and outlets for television sets and telephones. The charge without extras is $165 a week for the first eight weeks, then $140 a week. The price includes access to common laundry facilities, an outdoor pool, an exercise room, sauna and lobby telephone and television. \\n\\nShould a guest opt for the extras, maid service is $15 a visit and in-room telephones $10 a week, with free local calls. Guests who do not bring a television set can rent one for $10 a week. And for $20 a week, the hotel provides of towels, linens and cooking and eating utensils. \\n\\n\\"If you purchased all the extras, your bill is still around $30 a night,\\" said Richard Conti, senior principal for Laventhol & Horwath, a national accounting firm specializing in the lodging industry. The firm says room-rates here, including extended-stay chains, range for the most part from $60 to $80. \\n\\nStudio Plus is appealing to middle management business travelers, business trainees and transfers, Mr. Conti said. The budget-conscious concept also appeals to transient construction workers and people displaced in emergencies.\\n\\nThe 13-hotel chain reported average occupancy of 88 percent in 1989 compared with an industry average of 63 percent, said Richard Bubenhofer, director of marketing for Studio Plus. Laventhol figures showed a 58.6 percent rate here for the first quarter of 1990, the latest period for which statistics are available. \\n\\nMr. Bubenhofer said Studio Plus hopes the unstable economy will breed thriftiness in travelers and help the chain slice further into the hotel market here and in other Midwestern cities. \\n\\nStudio Plus now operates 13 hotels in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee. All are company-owned, although the chain has just begun selling franchises and is licensed to do so in 40 states. Mr. Bubenhofer said the five-year-old company has a goal of 100 in the next few years. \\n\\nRates vary in the nine cities where Studio Plus operates.
