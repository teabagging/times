Irresistible proof is available tonight on PBS's \\"Great Performances\\" as it presents an Australian production of \\"La Boheme\\" taped at the Sydney Opera House in January last year. The director is Baz Luhrmann, the young Austalian whose film \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" has been warmly welcomed on these shores.   For this opera production, which he first staged in 1990, Mr. Luhrmann has resorted to the potentially irritating, not to mention dangerous, gimmick of updating. His Paris jumps forward to the late 1950's. It is a city bursting with neon lights and espresso bars. Not everything falls into place.

For those who have not had the opportunity to smile at Mr. Michals's brand of whimsy or to wince at his sometimes saccharine sentimentality, this show can serve as a worthy introduction to his work.    For more than 20 years, Mr. Michals has tried to extend the narrative qualities of photography, and this exhibition includes examples of the various formats he has used to that end. There are the narrative sequences of images, resembling movie storyboards or the image-cycles popular in Victorian photography, for which he first achieved renown in the late 1960's. Also to be found here are the individual black-and-white photographs with quirky commentaries attached, which he has increasingly come to rely on. In recent years, Mr. Michals has also begun to paint more or less realistic images of fruits, flowers and the like on top of photographs, and several portraits done in this manner are included here as well.

It faithfully records the experiences of that plane's crew, Capt. R. K. Morgan in command, on its last heavy raid on Wilhelmshaven before it was ordered home. But essentially it tells the story of all the fliers in the Eighth Bomber Command and of all the ground crews who shove them skyward. It is a story that every American should know.The picture begins with glimpses of a peaceful English countryside—of a gray church tower, green hedgerows, rustic buildings and a waving field of grain. And then, as the commentator cautions that \\"this is a battlefront—a battlefront like no other in the long history of mankind's wars,\\" the camera panorama onto an airfield where green-brown bombers sit on broad runways. The contrast is startling and significant. \\"This is an airfront,\\" the commentator says.The film then shows the preparations for a routine \\"hauling job\\"—the loading of bombs into the great planes, the briefing of pilots and the going aboard of crews. In a sweep full of wonderful excitement the bombers thunder powerfully into the sky and head eastward across the English landscape for their perilous rendezvous.The action continuity is broken for a diagram of the tactical organization of this raid on a map, and then the picture continues with Memphis Belle and other bombers high in the sky. Ice forms on the windows, the fliers don their oxygen masks and feathery trails of vapor stream back from the roaring engines in the blue.As the planes approach their target bursts of flak appear in the sky—deadly black puffs which grow more frequent as the Belle levels off for her bombing run. The planes are now on the target, the fat yellow bombs are dropped away, and, from \\"9 o'clock,\\" the first fighters come sweeping in to attack.\\"The first half of the mission is over—the easy half. Now to get home!\\"Perhaps the most absorbing part of the picture is the subsequent sequence, taken within the Belle, showing the battle against enemy fighters, with dubbed dialogue of the crew on their interphones. From voices even but tense you hear—and then see—\\"There's four of 'em, coming in at 9 o'clock. They're breaking at 11. Get that ball turret on 'em!\\"—and then the angry chatter of machine guns.Or, heartbreakingly, you see a giant Fortress fall dizzily off below, with black smoke billowing behind her, as a voice notes, \\"B-17 out of control at 3 o'clock\\"—and then follows a few moments later with an urgent appeal to stricken friends: \\"Come on, you guys—get out of that plane! There go three 'chutes. There go two more.\\"\\"Sweating Out the Mission\\"Back at the base, the ground crews are then shown \\"sweating the mission out,\\" waiting—smoking and waiting—to hear the drone of their planes coming home. Finally the first of them come in. Some drop flares to warn of wounded men aboard. The bombers flop down on the runway. The ambulances go racing out to them. Some of the planes are torn with great holes. Some of them—not a scratch! At last, \\"the ship for which we'd all been pulling, the Memphis Belle,\\" comes home.The film ends by showing decorations pinned on the Belle's crew by the British King and Queen and by Generals Eaker and Devers. Then the Belle takes off for the United States.This film, which is a beautiful synthesis of the visual with voice and musical score, was directed by Lieut. Col. William Wyler, whose last Hollywood film was \\"Mrs. Miniver\\" prior to his joining the Air Force. Colonel Wyler also flew that final mission in the Memphis Belle and photographed much of the picture, in association with Capt. William C. Clothier and Lieut. Harold J. Tannenbaum. Lieutenant Tannenbaum was killed on a bombing mission over France.\\"The Memphis Belle\\" is being distributed on a non-profit basis by Paramount for the War Department and the Office of War Information.
