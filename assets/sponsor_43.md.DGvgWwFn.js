The answer lies in whether the impact of the new technology, based on microelectronic ''brains,'' is substantively different from that of all the earlier types of machinery to which capitalist societies successfully adjusted in the past.   Prof. Wassily W. Leontief of New York University, a Nobel laureate in economics, believes there is a fundamental difference. In the past, he says, ''machinery replaced the physical labor of human beings, but that made the mental efforts of people even more important and they could move to jobs machines could not perform.'' But now, he contends, ''smart machines'' are replacing the mental efforts of a great many people who have no place else to go.

Calif.: Economists will remain puzzled as long as they insist on talking about \\"the recession\\" because there are two different recessions at work, one cyclical -- which seems to be over -- the other structural, going strong and with no end in sight. The structural recession is characterized by a reversal of the usual cause-effect sequence. Layoffs, especially at high wage levels, are its main source rather than its result.   The two recessions interact: a cyclical downswing in 1990, combined with drastic cuts in defense spending and with growing global competition, have acted as catalysts to accelerate the restructurings of the workplace. They were driven in part by the efforts of businesses, mainly in the service sector, to reap long-overdue productivity returns from a huge investment in information technology. Let's Go Back to Before Reagan's 'Tax Reform'","excerpt":"Structural Recession"},{"year":"1990","title":"To the Editor:   Among the varieties of leadership available in India, it is true that V. P. Singh, who has resigned as Prime Minister, was the most deserving to lead the country (\\"A Test of Principles in India,\\" editorial, Nov. 8). However, his failings go beyond the issues you discuss.   V. P. Singh came to office on the specific promise of unearthing certain cases of kickbacks involving the Government of Rajiv Gandhi and a few overseas companies. But all such cases were conveniently relegated to the background in the intense jockeying for power.   Mr. Singh's revival of a dormant, ineffectual proposed \\"reservation-quota system\\" is not restricted to \\"low-caste Hindus,\\" as you state. It was broadened to include the \\"other backward castes,\\" many of whom are politically, socially and economically affluent.   This has become a very sensitive issue, leading dozens of youths to commit immolation in disgust. How would decision makers in this country respond if positions under affirmative action plans were usurped by the sons and daughters of a David Dinkins or a Douglas Wilder? V. P. Singh was not prepared to concede many angularities developed over the years in the reservation-quota system.   However shrewd and scheming, Mr. Singh was a politician with a relatively clean record. People had expected him to strike at the roots of the problems afflicting India.   Apart from economic reforms, India urgently requires structural reforms, mostly electoral-judicial and administrative-legislative. If applied firmly, these reforms could have taken care of the temple-mosque controversy and the conflict-ridden states.   How can a leader of the governing party resolve basic questions, sometimes involving unpopular measures, if he fears forces opposed to him within his party (the dissidents), in collaboration with the opposition, will topple his Government in a couple of months? This ailment is going to be endemic to the world's largest democracy. BINOY S.

And, in \\"Chain Lightning,\\" which, zipped into the Strand on Saturday, they are proving that they are first on the jet-propelled bandwagon with Hollywood's initial excursion into the wild blue yonder aboard the propellerless, supersonic aircraft. Like its title, this vehicle moves with exciting speed when it is airborne, but it slows down to a plodding walk as routine as a mailman's rounds when it hits the ground.However, credit the scenarists, who are not averse to dropping enlightening pointers in technical jargon","excerpt":"Stuart Heisler, the director, and a professional cast for not keeping this experimental craft in the drafting rooms or hangars too long. Their hero, Matt Brennan, a hardened, veteran airman, is kept aloft during most of the story from the time he is piloting B-17 bombers over Germany during the trying early days of the war up through the peacetime climax, when he is testing the newest jet jobs for an opportunist plane manufacturer. And, though a romantic triangle is injected into the proceedings, Cupid doesn't stand a chance in this air race against a clearly faster opponent.The flame-tailed, needle-nosed JA-3 is, after all, the \\"star\\" of this piece and Matt Brennan plays second fiddle to the plane as he takes it to Nome, from its home on the West Coast, for a flight to Washington, via the North Pole. Whether or not viewers will believe that such a flight can be made is beside the point. For it is, in effect, a super bird's-eye view of the future—or is it already the present?—of a rocket-like trip at a 90,000-foot altitude and a speed of 1,400 miles per hour.For thrill lagniappe there's the JA-3 hurtling into the National airport for a glider landing with empty fuel tanks. And, for an indication of speed via dialogue, there's Brennan's radio exchange en route, \\"JA-3 to Fort George. I am 50 miles north, of you . . . oops, I just passed you!\\" But Brennan is not the man to do this just for money and, in the climactic sequence, he makes his final and successful test of a newer plane's detachable \\"pod\\" cockpit which is designed to save pilots of damaged jets.As Matt Brennan, Humphrey Bogart, despite some \\"Buck Rogers\\" costuming, makes a tough, realistic but nonchalant pioneer, who is willing to take more than a few, precious moments from his allotted \\"borrowed time\\" so that another safety element may be added to supersonic flight. Richard Whorf does a competent job as the idealistic and ill-fated plane and \\"pod\\" cockpit designer for whom he risks his life. And, Eleanor Parker, as the romantic partner for whom they compete; and Raymond Massey, as the grasping, publicity-conscious tycoon, who is ready to stick the Army with a jet that promises to be obsolete, do equally well in the other principal assignments. But in an air age in which the headlines already are threatening to date their efforts, \\"Chain Lightning\\" leaves a general impression of being only a neatly-turned action yarn. As such, it is successful.On the stage of the Strand is the Latin Quarter revue with Joey Bishop, Ernestine Mercer, Lucienne and Ashour, Ben Yost's Vikings, Linda Lombard, Ballet Sevillano, Calvin Holt, Gail Bennett and Lynn Storm.

A year later, I left to pursue other adventures. But I retain fond memories of my brief high-paying apprenticeship in big-time corporate law. The firm was a surprisingly friendly place, and working there satisfied a wonky interest in the intricacies of the Federal tax code, and an ambition, stemming from my 60's upbringing, to be part of important social change.         This, recall, was 1976. Thanks largely to the women's movement, hard-won changes in discrimination law and the not unrelated boom in the number of women  attending law school, major private firms were making a concerted effort to open their doors to women. At the point I showed up for work, along with a handful of other women more obviously suited for the enterprise, my firm's crowded letterhead included just one female associate and no female partners. That made  us pioneers of sorts. The thought that we were helping to advance the cause of women's equality imbued even my low-level work on drab tax-shelter deals with a  sense of larger social purpose.

To get to crowded, sprawling, unappealing Heathrow Airport, you must either ride the subway, which stops more than a dozen times en route from central London; catch the airport bus, or take a cab, which costs about $20. British Rail's new Gatwick connection makes the run from Victoria Station through south London and into the Sussex countryside - a trip that can take up to 90 minutes when driving - in half an hour. One- way fare is $6.20 first class, $4.15 second class.   Not all airlines use Gatwick, and some that do use it fly only to a limited number of destinations. But if you're starting a European holiday in London, as many people do, and continuing on to the Continent, you may be able to fly from Gatwick as easily as from Heathrow. Some trans-Atlantic carriers, including Delta and British Caledonian, operate from Gatwick, too.
