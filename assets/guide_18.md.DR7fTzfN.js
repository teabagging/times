The airlines supply the tickets with the proviso that consolidators not advertise which airline will supply the seats.    Consolidators, or bucket shops, as they are called in Britain, deal almost entirely in overseas tickets. Many of them, including George Chen, president of C. L. Thomson Express, probably the largest in this country, began their businesses in ethnic communities in the United States where residents wanted to visit their countries of origin for reasonable fares.    The consolidator industry has had an uncertain reputation. The New York Metropolitan Better Business Bureau has kept an eye on it virtually since it sprang up, after the airline industry was deregulated in 1979. Two things have dropped a mantle of respectability on the business in recent months.   The first is that more travel agents are willing to deal with consolidators. Because major airlines now cap at $50 the 10 percent commissions they pay travel agents for domestic airline tickets, agents are looking for profit opportunities. One is to buy tickets at a cheaper price, which is the consolidator's stock in trade. The agent then marks up the tickets and resells them. The customer pays no more than before, perhaps even less, and the travel agent can still earn more than the airline's 10 percent.   A second change is on the horizon: nine big consolidators are organizing the Air Consolidation Association, a trade group that plans to set standards and police the industry.  One Passenger Saves $834    A friend of mine who wanted to travel to London inexpensively contacted her travel agent, Joyce Palmer at Union Tours in New York. Ms. Palmer sold her a consolidator ticket on British Airways with a daytime departure on a Wednesday earlier this month. The ticket, which Ms. Palmer obtained through Travac, a consolidator, cost $450 plus airport taxes round trip, a saving of $168 over the $618 quoted by British Airways for a 21-day advance purchase economy ticket with a Wednesday morning departure. The price the airline would have charged her for the full economy ticket was $642 one way, plus taxes. She saved $834, taxes not counted.    My friend did not have to buy her ticket 21 days in advance, and this waived requirement for advance purchase, as well as for Saturday night stays, is a big part of the value of a consolidator ticket.   But there are drawbacks. If a flight is canceled, the ticket cannot be used on another airline. This may not be a problem if the line has many flights to the client's destination, but if there are only three flights a week, say, it may be. Frequent flier mileage is not usually given, although Ms. Palmer said that sometimes gate agents will punch the frequent flier number in for a traveler.   Other limits may apply: changes may cost $75 or be strictly curbed. British Airways, for example, will not give an advance seat assignment because seats for lower-priced tickets are limited.   Another problem is that tickets may be delivered quite late, but consolidators who have long-standing agreements with airlines may provide tickets well in advance.  An Unregulated Area    The files in this department contain dismal tales of consolidators who have run off with the money. No one regulates them. One expert said that to set up as a consolidator, \\"all you need is a telephone and a fax.\\" A dishonest operator can fax notice of a fictitious three-day fare sale to travel agents, with tickets to be delivered later. By the time the agents realize that the tickets are not coming, the phone is disconnected.    Airlines, the source of the tickets, try to provide consolidator tickets to companies that will not damage their reputations, but they cannot control a secondary consolidator who may buy from the original one, or several intermediaries.   Jax Fax, a monthly magazine that lists cheap fares and tours, is a principal resource for travel agencies","excerpt":"28,000 of them subscribe to it. The June issue will contain 5,000 listings, a record number, paid for by the 125 consolidators offering them.   Clif Cooke, who has published Jax Fax from Darien, Conn., since 1973, says he drops three or four \\"listers\\" every month, either because they evoke complaints from travel agents or they fail to pay their Jax Fax bills. New advertisers fill out a \\"sort of credit rating form,\\" Mr. Cooke said, and the total of 125 consolidators has been pretty stable. Last month, however, he rejected six new applicants, another record.    \\"The commission caps have kicked off a big desire on the part of quasi-businessmen to get into this area,\\" he said. \\"There are a lot of slippery people out there. They start out as United Wonderful Travel, go out of business and reappear as Global Integrity Tours.\\"    Unlike Jax Fax, which limits its circulation to travel agents, a new loose-leaf directory of consolidators is sold to both agents and consumers. According to Pamela Erwin, associate publisher, \\"Index to Air Travel Consolidators and Wholesalers\\" was first issued by Travel Publishing Inc. in 1993 and has been updated three times. The price of $49.50 plus $3.75 postage provides the basic book and a year of updated pages. In May the book listed 200 consolidators. There is no charge for the listings, which include names of airlines.   The book includes numerical ratings provided by some of the travel agents among the 2,000 to 3,000 subscribers reported by Ms. Erwin. If a dozen or so agents give a good rating, it is put on the sheet that gives details about the consolidator. Lower ratings are provided on separate rating sheets, which may be based on reports from fewer than three subscribers. Agents who give ratings feedback get a discount on subscriptions.    As a sample entry, the sheet on Travac says the company has annual sales of $25 million and uses British Airways, Delta, Air France, United, American, Continental, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines and Swissair. Travac gets a rating of 8.89 on a scale of 10. It accepts payments by Visa, Mastercard or travel agency check. Sindy Calay, a co-owner, said that the company could deliver tickets six weeks in advance, with overnight delivery costing $7 more. Ms. Calay said that Travac sold to the general public, but made 80 percent of its sales through travel agents.    For information about buying the directory: Travel Publishing, Norwest Center Skyway, 56 East Sixth Street, Suite 402, St. Paul, Minn. 55101; (612) 292-0325.   The Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York offers a helpful four-page fact sheet about consolidators, originally prepared in 1992 and sent on mail request. It also has two automated phone lines for learning about or lodging complaints.    If the call is made to (212) 533-6200, a charge of $3.80 will be put on the caller's credit card. A call to (900) 225-5222 costs 95 cents a minute, with an average call costing $3.80. This charge appears on the phone bill. A company's record is free on request from the Better Business Bureau, 257 Park Avenue South, New York, N.Y. 10010.

Here are six choices along the block.    CORNELIA STREET CAFE  (212) 989-9319","excerpt":"29 Cornelia Street; $$; Article: 7/23/02.       From readings of poetry to art exhibitions and jazz, this spot has been praised more for cultural nourishment than culinary exploits. But the succulent steamed mussels and hearty soups prove that there is more to this friendly place than great entertainment.    HOME  (212) 243-9579; 20 Cornelia Street; $$; Article: 11/6/02.       Home serves stylized renditions of American classics. The husband-and-wife owners, David Page and Barbara Shinn, offer dishes that touch a nostalgic chord without being sentimental, like meaty pork chops and, at lunch, a terrific hamburger served with rich homemade ketchup and onion rings.    LE GIGOT  (212) 627-3737; 18 Cornelia Street; $$; Article: 12/22/00.       If memories of Paris stimulate your romantic nerve, Le Gigot should set you atingle. From the beautiful parquet floor to the mirrored walls crisscrossed with polished wood to the little zinc bar and window seats, Le Gigot pulses with the welcoming spirit of a Parisian hangout. The current menu includes bouillabaisse, duck confit and crab cakes.    LITTLE HAVANA  (212) 255-2212; 30 Cornelia Street; $; $25 and Under: 2/18/98, Article: 3/17/00.       This restaurant combines classic Cuban dishes like black bean soup; shredded skirt steak with rice and beans; and arroz con pollo with an appreciation for organic, healthy ingredients. The result is lighter Cuban food that sacrifices little of the flavor.    PEARL OYSTER BAR  (212) 691-8211; 18 Cornelia Street; $; Article: 8/27/03.       Rebecca Charles founded Pearl Oyster Bar in 1997 in homage to the fresh seafood she grew up eating on summer vacations in Maine. Beyond the oysters, lobster rolls are meaty and delicious, chowder is made with smoked bacon and clams, and the blueberry pie is sensational.    PÓ  (212) 645-2189; 31 Cornelia Street; $; $25 and Under: 6/6/01.       This Italian bistro was made famous by its original owner, Mario Batali. In 2000 Mr. Batali officially cut his ties to Pó, leaving it solely in the hands of his partner, Steven Crane. Today the food is as good it was years ago. What's more, the prices have stayed remarkably reasonable.     Current selections include grilled Italian sausages served with white beans, broccoli rabe and black olive pesto; and veal Marsala.

He was surprised to hear a three-club bid on his left, and astonished to hear his partner double. How many clubs were there in this deck?   Not so many after all, as he discovered when he reviewed his hand and discovered that both his black suits were spades. Combining them produced the hand shown in the diagram, and he electrified the table by leaping to seven spades. West doubled pityingly and Gould redoubled. The club ace was led confidently, and South ruffed, crossed to the fortuitous spade eight, and threw his diamond loser on the club king.   The score for North-South was 2,840 -- this was before the days of bonuses for making doubled contracts -- and the opponents screamed for the tournament director. \\"How could he open two no-trump with that hand?\\"   The director was not sympathetic, and, indeed, West was somewhat naive. If your opponent ever bids in a totally extraordinary fashion, watch out. It is highly likely that he mis-sorted his hand in the first place.   But if you are ever on the right side of such a drama you will have cause to remember it, as Gould does, half a century later. \\"For a 20-year-old,\\" he says, \\"that was truly the hand of a lifetime.\\"  Final standings in the North American Pair Championships played in Allendale, N.J., on Sunday were:   Open division, 1st, Alexander Allen, New Brunswick, N.J., and Frank Silver, Short Hills, N.J.","excerpt":"2d, Laura Brill and Rick Goldstein, White Plains, tied Rev.

In this connection, the Independent Cinema of Canada program that opened yesterday at the Film Forum may perhaps represent the bottomless abyss.Not that all 10 of the films are bad","excerpt":"3 are even modestly good. But those that are bad are very very bad, and in ways that I had thought to have seen the last of more than a decade ago.The films run from 2 to 35 minutes, and, selected by the Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Center, they come from Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver. They are not all very recent and at least one, Martin Lavut's \\"At Home\\" (1968), has been seen here before.\\"At Home,\\" a study in domestic clutter, succeeds, through a succession of gently mounting absurdities, in becoming a fairly funny movie. Humor is an aim shared by none of the other Canadian films, though both John Straiton's pleasant montage of old Edward Muybridge photographs, \\"Animals in Motion,\\" and Bob Conway's satiric \\"Skin Deep\\" display civilized virtues.But everything else on the program is either a lifecycle myth and/or a moral meditation about war and industrialization and similar forms of depravity. There is some animation (notably, John Straiton's \\"Eurynome,\\" an elaborate clay animation) and much of that forced mutation of color that typically signifies the mind of the artist over nature.No fewer than four of the films and with a nuclear explosion, and two also manage to quote from the Apocalypse. This may indicate legitimate thoughtful anxiety (several thoughtful anxieties out of date), but I think it also suggests that in the movies, if lack of time, talent, or money keeps you from making it with boy-meets-girl, you can always and easily produce the end of the world.

All of which makes it downright curious that the most distinctive rock bands the city has spawned during the last two or three years have been purveyors of tuneful pop-rock or equally traditional garage-rock. There's still plenty of progressivism afoot, to be sure. But none of the city's younger progressive bands have been able to match either the spirit or the craftsmanship of bands like the dB's, the Individuals, or the Fleshtones, bands that have chosen to build on traditional foundations, and particularly on various aspects of 60's rock.   On Saturday night, the dB's will be at CBGB, Bowery at Bleecker Street, and the Fleshtones will be at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street in Hoboken.

There are no dizzying jet tours of international locations. Jaclyn Smith does not pop up as America's  Ambassador to Romania (that was \\"Windmills of the Gods\\"). This time around, perhaps exhausted, Mr. Sheldon limits himself to San Francisco, specifically the Embarcadero City Hospital and its motley staff of brilliant women and resentful  men.
