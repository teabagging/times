Both areas offer rich reminders of the city's past.

Both subjects will be on the agenda when the Roundtable's 45-member policy committee meets Tuesday in New York.  On indexation, committee members endorse the principle of denying the Treasury the tax windfall it gets when inflation forces taxpayers into higher brackets. Since seeing the President's $200 billion deficit projection in the budget for the fiscal year 1984, however, the committee will consider proposing that the President postpone the Jan. 1, 1985, date when indexation is scheduled to take effect. The committee will also consider proposing a trigger - maybe inflation of 3 or 4 percent - before indexation would be allowed.

Then, at 10 this evening, HBO's \\"When It Was a Game II\\" returns to the seemingly more innocent and less mercenary days of Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio with extraordinary scenes culled from 8- and 16-millimeter home movies.   \\"The Comrades of Summer,\\" a somewhat slack but amiable exercise, stars Joe Mantegna (think of just about anything David Mamet has ever written) as Sparky Smith. Sparky's career with the Seattle Mariners comes to a sudden end when he is injured making a car commercial. His boss (Michael Lerner) is not sorry to see him go. His two former wives couldn't care less. Worse, his endorsement contracts are being canceled.

In its defense, whatever bittersweet sentiment and sophistication the score possesses would probably work better in a smaller theater with a practiced ensemble of comic actors. Given the Met's 4,000-seat opera barn and the constantly shifting parade of famous and semifamous singers that have traipsed through this production over the last four years, Mr. Schenk's approach maybe makes sense.    At least it seemed to do so on Monday night, when the production returned for its first performance of the season. The decision to bifurcate the operetta linguistically, with the dialogue in English and the musical text in German, remains absurd. One argument against opera in English -- that the composer's inspiration is tarnished without the actual vowel sounds heard in the inner ear at the time of creation -- makes less sense with Johann Strauss Jr.'s frothy music, for all its enchanting charms. And if the fear is that international star singers won't bother to learn English words, surely those in this cast who took the trouble to master the English dialogue (now credited to the current stage director, Paul Mills) could stretch to learn new English song texts, too.

Twenty years later, Mr. Pogorelich made headlines when his elimination before the final round caused a ruckus among the jurors. Mr. Pogorelich ended up far better known than that year's winner, the Vietnamese pianist Dang Thai Son.    Mr. Pollini and Mr. Pogorelich are about to have something else in common: both are involved with new piano competitions, and both are hoping, against the odds, that they can identify pianists who will stand out in the already overcrowded field of contest winners.

Mr. Sorvino replaces George Dzundza, who apparently wasn't happy with the weekly exposure he was getting in the \\"Law\\" portion of the program. No problem for the producers of this ensemble show. The Dzundza character was simply mowed down. Goodbye George, welcome Paul, who will now play a New York City detective sergeant, Phil Cerreta, new partner to the younger Mike Logan (Chris Noth).
