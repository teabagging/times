The film itself, which spans the same wild extremes that Warhol's life did, offers strong evidence to the contrary. It bears out the thought that Warhol, described by one of Mr. Workman's many interviewees as \\"this crazy peasant who somehow is the eye of the storm,\\" was indeed a person about whom others -- and he himself, in \\"The Andy Warhol Diaries\\" -- could speak volumes.    Mr. Workman, using many conversations with Warhol's friends and associates, as well as frequent glimpses of his films, paintings and early advertising illustrations, has a distinct visual advantage over the artist's print biographers. He uses it well. \\"Superstar\\" displays much of the lively eccentricity that so captivated Warhol and also stops to note the artifice behind it (which is never hard to spot in any of the artist's pet luminaries).

There were present more than 3,000 persons who jammed the auditorium to the doors and overflowed into the foyer.The decorations in the house are composed of various styles of architecture, Doric columns upholding the sides of the proscenium, baroque scroll work, murals depicting caravans in the Orient and heroic Greek statutes which guard each side of the stage. The program describes the decorative elements as \\"representative of New York, which has drawn to itself all that is most gorgeous from the four corners of the earth.\\"The feature picture of the evening was \\"Tiger Rose,\\" an audible film with Lupe Velez and Monte Blue in the principal rôles. As Rose, Miss Velez portrays a half-caste belle who is sought by all the men in the Canadian district. She is also loved by Devlin, a sergeant in the Northwest Mounted Police. Rose, however, has affection only for a \\"railroader\\" named Bruce, who comes to take her away with him to the big city.There is some shooting in which Bruce kills a doctor who tries to prevent Rose from leaving her native haunts. Then there is the chase after the murderer in which Devlin, the stalwart \\"Mountie,\\" captures the criminal only to release him because of his love for the girl.The episode in which the policeman conceals himself under a tarpaulin of a canoe in which the lovers are escaping down the rapids drew much laughter from the first night audience. Monte Blue as the Irish officer who speaks with a heavy brogue is only fair in his part and Grant Withers as Bruce is believable and makes the most of the part.
