Some of his sharpest swipes of wit were used to slash the cloaks of sanctimony off the cosiest hypocrites. And so it is not surprising to find one of his last-made films, called here \\"The Virtuous Scoundrel\\" but known in France as \\"La Vie d'un honnête homme,\\" to be a sad little object lesson in the consequences of wearing a false front—of bogus respectability, that is. It opened here at the Fifth Avenue Cinema yesterday.The central character in this discourse—and discourse it largely is, since M. Guitry possessed a perilous weakness for conveying his dramas in dialogue—is a wealthy, smug and impressive French industrialist who has the heart of a glass of cold water. He is played by Michel Simon.Although he has a wife and children—a grown-up daughter and son—he is quite as bored in their company as they are in his. He seems to suspect their insincerity. They secretly sense he is a fraud. He is cynical, bilious and unhappy—all conveyed in standard Guitry dialogue.Fancy, then, his transformation when he suddenly has a chance to assume the identity of a wastrel twin brother who returns from a thirty-year obscurity and then dies. (This all happens in a cheap hotel room, with M. Simon deftly playing the two men","excerpt":"under M. Guitry's dry direction, it makes for the picture's tightest scene.)With his raffish twin buried in his clothing and himself moving into his own home in the guise of the sardonic brother, the industrialist has a chance to prove the selfishness of his family and the perfidy of his friends. Particularly does he discover the greed and deceit of his wife. Then, with his own deception about to be discovered, he goes off sadly into the night.M. Simon gives a finished performance, first as the harsh industrialist and then as the uninhibited brother whose attitudes and mannerisms he assumes. Some of his little scenes are trenchant; one is sardonically droll. That is when the stuffed shirt finds himself cast as the current procurer for an appreciative prostitute.Marguerite Pierry, one of M. Guitry's old stand-bys, is acidly effective as the wife, Laura Badie is priggish as the daughter and François Guerin is bloodless as the son. Lana Marconi (Mme. Guitry) is amusingly breezy in the bit of the prostitute, Louis de Funes is funny as a butler and Claudia Gensac is tart as a maid.But there's a strange insufficiency about this picture, a sort of weariness of craft and wit, as though the old Guitry had an idea but not the strength to finish it. The cynicism is present but it is not clearly crystallized, and the ending is abrupt and inconclusive, as though M. Guitry himself got bored and tired. What it comes down to, in essence, is a hopeful but sterile exercise. And the English subtitles for the French dialogue are dismally uninspired.

But the movement that is marking its 25th anniversary, being as fractured and indescribable as any bunch of Americans, has spun off a thousand more specialized interest groups, joined in turn by homosexuals of disparate identities.    Newsstands decked out for the celebration pitch to every erotic niche that's been thought of, and they show that gay people have organized around a lot of nonsexual interests, too -- like Marxism and Catholicism, dentistry and model railroading. Visitors' guides list Manhattan bars, but you can also find in them the phone number of the Gay/Lesbian Scrabble Club. And because there's a publication for everyone, gay America's subcultures and sub-subcultures have written their own versions of what they bring to the table this weekend. A few examples follow. LAURA MANSNERUS    What a thrill to be writing to you on the eve of the Stonewall/Gay Games celebration in New York City. With all of those activists, socialites and girljocks on hand, marching may not be the only workout you'll get. -- Heather Findlay, editor, writing in On Our Backs, a bimonthly for lesbians published in San Francisco.      Are you tired of being represented in the news media by Luke Sissyfag, Act Up and Nambla (the National Man-Boy Love Association)?   Yes, Virginia! It's O.K. to be gay and Republican! It's O.K. to care about high taxes, crime, excessive government, as well as human and gay rights and aggressive funding for the fight against AIDS. It's even O.K. to care about values which will preserve and strengthen our gay relationships, homes and spiritual lives. -- Message accompanying membership form in the newsletter of the Log Cabin Club of New York, an affiliate of the national Log Cabin Federation, for gay Republicans.     When the Apostle Paul declared: \\"In Christ there is neither male nor female, Jew nor Gentile, slave nor free,\\" this was a liberating message that proclaimed equality and justice. However, the proclamation that we are all \\"one\\" can sometimes blur our differences and reinforce the norms of the majority.    Thus, in our church communities, we might reword Paul's declaration by saying, \\"In Christ, there is male and female, old and young, disabled and temporarily able-bodied, lesbian, gay and heterosexual.\\"   We are seeking new theological \\"wineskins\\" that can adequately hold and convey the good news of God's love and justice for our day, as well as recovering the old language and imagery when it is life-giving and can convey to people in our times the heart of the message. -- The Rev. Melanie Morrison, in Open Hands, published by Protestant organizations welcoming gay men and lesbians.     Like responsible heterosexuals, we have the choice of whether (and, yes, when) to parent. But unlike heterosexuals, we and our communities still remember the time when to be gay was to preclude parenting. Because of this, we are less likely to believe that we \\"have to\\" parent, that it \\"makes us truly\\" men or women or adult. These and other myths are central to the socialization of most heterosexual women and men. As a consequence, we are uniquely able to \\"consider parenthood.\\"   Lesbian and gay parents DO have an advantage: we KNOW that there is more to life than we were first led to believe from our families. Since we weren't fooled then, perhaps we won't be now. We need not be fooled by some of the social myths about parenting -- that it's a \\"woman's instinct,\\" or that it just requires that you be \\"a good person.\\" -- Valory Mitchell and Diane Wilson, psychotherapists, writing in The Family Next Door, a newsletter for lesbian and gay parents and their friends.      The world is not an easy place for Muslims. We are viewed with great suspicion, constantly discriminated against, and openly called barbaric warmongers and oppressive tyrants. Those of us who know better find this incredible. Most Muslims are gentle, noble, peaceful people, and our societies are tolerant and charitable.   Gay people are very familiar with this same paradox, and as a gay Muslim man I have found that, by and large, the same people who would discriminate against me because of my sexuality would also do so because of my religion.   It is usually my lesbian sisters and gay brothers who are the first to stand by me when others accuse me of belonging to a religion that advocates the subjugation of women or terrorist bombing attacks. They understand that prejudice and ignorance are universal adversaries, whether the issue is religious freedom or sexual freedom.   Sadly, many leaders within the Muslim community have not made the same connection. -- Shaffiq Essajee, writing in Trikone magazine, for gay and lesbian South Asians.      In a small and esoteric community such as ours, a little prejudice and intolerance can do a lot of damage. I've met people of color who have dropped out of the scene because their fantasies or partners were unacceptable to the groups they were in.   I've known people who have hidden the fact that they enjoyed cross-dressing, acted \\"too feminine\\" or \\"too masculine\\" in public, or liked to sleep and play with people of the \\"wrong\\" sex or gender, in a community that claims to cherish the sexual outlaw.    This seems even more incongruous and ironic in the year celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, which were carried out by the very people who are looked down upon now: drag queens, effeminate gay men and diesel dykes, most of whom were people of color. -- Antoinette, editor, BlackLeather, Leather on the Cutting Edge for People of Color and Their Friends.      Until more aviators with H.I.V. and AIDS are visible, we'll miss opportunities to learn and share and support. And yes, to be supported, too.   Maybe that's the hardest part for a pilot . . . admitting you need (or may need) support -- that you're not in control. Pilots are taught to be independent, strong, brave, always in control. How many times have we boasted (or bemoaned) the fact that the PIC bears ultimate responsibility for the flight, no matter who else may be involved in a supportive role?   Losing control is perceived as the ultimate humiliation for a pilot. But that's exactly what H.I.V. does -- pilots lose control of their careers and their health. Fortunately, my faith and a great set of friends made it easy for me to learn to let go. -- Ron S., writing in NGPA News, the quarterly of the National Gay Pilots Association.      On June 26, New York City is going to witness a massive gathering of gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgendered people. This gathering, Stonewall 25: International March on the United Nations to Affirm the Human Rights of Lesbian and Gay People, marks the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. There is, however, a lot of controversy surrounding this celebration.   Bisexuals and transgendered people are feeling excluded because they aren't part of the title. Stonewall organizers have said that the words \\"transgendered\\" and \\"bisexual\\" cannot be understood or translated on an international level. Transgendered activists feel that is perhaps the lamest excuse the committee could have come up with.   So we urge you to come to New York City to show your pride in who you are, whoever you consider yourself to be. The important thing is to be proud. Remember that! -- BiFocus, a newsletter for Philadelphia's bisexual community Word for Word/ Gay Magazines","excerpt":"Under Many Banners: Varied Voices In Gay Life Not Always in Chorus"},{"year":"1968","title":"Drive to plant trees, NYC, discussed","excerpt":"under matching-tree program NYC supplies 6 trees for every 4 provided by citizen coms;

I want to call your attention to the efforts at Norwalk Hospital to minimize errors and advance the education of all surgeons. At patient discharge, every chart is scanned in the record room and all complications are brought to the attention of a quality review committee. A complication is defined as any unanticipated development. The committee includes members of various specialties, and membership rotates.    The responsible surgeon discusses his patient's complication, in writing or in person. Surgeons are constantly on trial with their peers to maintain competence. Hard work is needed to meet this professional obligation.   The patient stands to gain most by this emphasis on care and caring, by not allowing his surgeon to be an independent entrepreneur.

The guild believes that handing out production credits as deal points devalues the contributions of people who actually did the work. Mr. Yari and Mark Harris, who was also denied a credit, believe the Producer’s Guild has little knowledge of how independent movies actually come together in the modern era of film-making. All of the fuss is an attempt to avoid the kind of traffic jam that occurred when “Shakespeare in Love” won at the 1999 ceremony, with a total of five producers heading up to the stage to make a grab for the Oscar and the limelight.

Real estate, for example, stands to lose some of its investment luster if depreciation and other real-estate tax benefits are scaled back. Tax-exempt municipal bonds would become less valuable, if personal income-tax rates were lowered, while corporate bonds, savings accounts and other fully taxable investments would become relatively more attractive. Any decision to curtail the existing preferential tax treatment of long-term capital gains would reduce the after-tax return on collectibles, precious metals and other investments whose principal return is capital appreciation.   A fundamental overhaul of the corporate income tax would have a profound influence on the investment merits of most companies and industries. Proposals to eliminate many of the tax incentives for business that now pervade the tax code and to impose a lower tax rate on corporations, if enacted, would prompt a reordering of the after-tax returns of corporate America.

As a result, Nynex will put a landscaped observation deck on the roof of the substation. The agreement, negotiated by the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, calls for Nynex to pay about $250,000 in rent over a 10-year period, contribute $75,000 toward a project to stabilize the tower and pay for building the observation deck.   Daniel Kime, a spokesman for Nynex Mobile Communications Company, said that Nynex approached the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation because the island seemed the best place for a substation that would let the company strengthen service for customers in parts of the East Side of Manhattan, where signals have been weakened by the F.D.R. Drive's tunnels and overhangs. The substation will be a 20- by 20-foot reinforced concrete structure about 10 feet high holding an antenna, switching equipment and air-conditioners. It will be built on a slope that rises from the East River just to the west of the tram station. Lee Weintraub and John di Domenico, Manhattan landscape architects, will collaborate with the sculptor Donna Dennis on the design of the deck.

Unfortunately, about half of those with underactive thyroids do not know they have a definable and treatable problem.

She had attended a conference called ''The World After Nuclear War'' last October at which Dr. Carl Sagan and other scientists reported on the effects of nuclear explosions on our ecosphere. Her presentation was informed, low key and devastating.\\n\\n A two-year study conducted by more than 100 biologists, physicists and atmospheric scientists found that the explosion of 5,000 megatons, less than one half the world's nuclear arsenal, would blanket much of the earth with a thick cloud of soot and smoke that would obscure the sun for months, thereby creating a ''nuclear winter'' of sub-zero temperatures even in the summer. Virtually all crops and farm animals would be destroyed. Most of the human survivors would starve. Forests would be burned, topsoil eroded, weeds and insects would multiply, and storms of enormous violence would devastate our coastal areas. \\n\\nA global ''toxic smog'' would spread radioactive dust around the world, ultimately in both hemispheres. When the clouds lifted whatever life remained would be at the mercy of ''untenable'' ultraviolet rays. Even the explosion of 100 megatons, less than 1 percent of existing nuclear inventories, in low-yield airbursts over cities, would light enough fires to generate a ''nuclear winter'' almost as severe as in the 5,000-megaton case.

Miller have reassembled some of last year's crime news into a crisp, cohesive and fast-moving script, which has been capitally served by such Warner crime experts as Edward G. Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, Barton MacLane and Joan Biondell.Crime, as you must have heard, ceased during prohibition to be merely thuggery and skull-duggery, becoming instead a highly organized business whose methods were equally adaptable to strong arm control of the produce and poultry markets, the laundry and dairy industries, slot machines, pin games, the numbers racket and a host of others. There have been a dozen screen investigations of crime syndicates, sponsored at one moment by the G-men, at another by a crusading district attorney, at a third by one of those adventure-some movie reporters. \\"Bullets or Ballots\\" offers a new approach—a legislative inquiry, which gives sweeping powers to an honest police commissioner and a tough detective.Moving swiftly from the start, the picture begins with the murder of a crusading publisher (in New York, not Minneapolis), which brings on the legislative investigation and converts Detective Johnny Blake from a Bronx exile into an undercover man for the department. Believed to have been discharged from the force by the new commissioner, he gains the confidence of the racket boss, and, after tipping the police to the activities of the gangsters, eventually brings about the destruction of the syndicate and the arrest of the political higher-ups who controlled the ring.If this sounds like the old formula—and it is—still there is no disputing the picture's claim upon your attention, its graphic depiction of the scope of modern organized crime, its fidelity to known criminal facts and methods and its suspenseful handling of the familiar melodramatic materials that have gone into it. William Keighley, the director, has had the judgment to keep the romantic side of the story in its correctly subordinate place and concentrate on the far more dramatic game of cops and robbers.Although Mr. Robinson's detective, Johnny Blake, figures in some wild-eyed melodrama as the film races along, the character at least has been taken from life. Johnny Blake is easily recognizable as headquarters Johnny Broderick, sometimes known as the Duke and sometimes as \\"the toughest cop of Broadway.\\" Blake has read Mr. Broderick's book of etiquette and moves through the picture insisting that gangsters tip their hats to him when they meet, mussing them up whenever the occasion offers (or can be made to), and dressing in the best Broadway manner. It is a top-notch performance, his best in fact since \\"Little Caesar.\\"Humphrey Bogart, late of \\"The Petrified Forest,\\" turns in another grim portrayal of a killer as the ambitious lieutenant of the racket boss. Barton MacLane plays the overlord with proper regard for the type's new dignity as an industrial chief, and there are well-managed characterizations right down the cast line by Miss Blondell, Frank McHugh, Joseph King, George E. Stone, Louise Beavers and the others.

The proposal is a radical one in that it gets to the heart of what is most wrong now: The existing tax system is encrusted with an incredible amount of barnacles, tax breaks, tax loopholes, deductions and exemptions, accumulated over the past 70 years. These distort the decision-making process in the quest for tax advantages and are grossly inequitable as among different individuals and industries.   Hence, the first great effect of overhauling the tax system would be to increase economic efficiency. As Joseph A. Pechman of the Brookings Institution says in a forthcoming book, ''A Citizen's Guide to the New Tax Reforms,'' although it is impossible to know in advance precisely how much the increase would be, ''lower tax rates would increase incentives to work, save and invest and reduce the incentive to cheat.''
