The company, which had paid for and edited Mr. Ellis's third novel, \\"American Psycho,\\" and was preparing to ship it to bookstores next month, abruptly decided not to publish it. Richard E. Snyder, the chairman of Simon & Schuster, said the reason he had overruled his top editors was \\"a matter of taste.\\" Two magazines recently offered pre-publication criticism of the book, in which a serial killer's mutilations of women are graphically described. Mr. Ellis accused Simon & Schuster of censorship and said he probably would never publish with the company again. But if his sensibilities were offended, his finances were not. He got to keep the $300,000 Simon & Schuster had paid him and his agent said other companies immediately lined up to bid for the book. By week's end, Vintage Books had acquired it for an undisclosed price.

But afternoon football on Fox, which spilled into prime time, gave Fox the lead among adults 18 to 49, while NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' coverage of the Seattle Seahawks' nail-biting victory over the Denver Broncos finished the night in second place in that category. CBS outdrew ABC in both the 9 and 10 o'clock time slots, according to Nielsen's estimates, as CBS's ''Cold Case'' (14.2 million viewers) and ''Without a Trace'' (14.1 million) surpassed ABC's ''Desperate Housewives'' (12 million) and ''Brothers & Sisters'' (6.9 million). But at 8, CBS's ''Amazing Race 10'' (10.7 million) could not defeat ABC's ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' repeat (12.7 million). On Friday night ABC ranked first over all with a broadcast of the Robert Zemeckis film ''The Polar Express'' from 8 to 10. Also on Friday, a special two-hour episode of NBC's ''Las Vegas'' earned a season high 10.3 million viewers from 9 to 11, leading the 10 o'clock hour and giving NBC a second-place finish for the night.

By day, John worked as Executive Vice President, Director of Research, and Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Division of the Capital Group Companies, an L.A.based group with offices in New York. He divided his time between the two cities and most enjoyed mentoring younger employees to preserve the Company's institutional memory.

He served as Chairman of the Princeton Alumni Schools Committee in Manhattan for the five years prior to his death and graduated from the French Culinary Institute in 1994, where he trained in the art of pastry and chocolate-making under the direction of Jacques Torres. He was a devotee of amateur astronomy, physical training, the Mets and the Jets, and wine collecting and was an enthusiastic member of the WIGWAM Wine Group of Los Angeles. He generously supported many arts organizations and non-profit institutions including Princeton University, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Metropolitan Opera, American Museum of Natural History, Los Angeles Opera, Central Park Conservancy and Wildlife Conservation Society.

An old river town, it is oriented toward the Mississippi, which is still busy with towboats and barges.

A prairie upstart, its flat, neatly gridded streets stretch westward toward the surrounding farmland.\\n\\nThe two cities retain their different flavors still, though relentless urban growth has blurred their borders. The result is a metropolitan area of 2.1 million people, with two downtowns less than 15 minutes apart by highway. On a map, it looks like a double-yolked egg or a binary star.

RUDIN-Lewis. The entire Yeshiva University Family mourns the passing of its devoted friend, a giant among the humanitarians, civic leaders, and philanthropists who immeasurably enriched New York City's quality of life for generations. With his brother Jack he maintained and expanded the Rudin Family tradition of caring, compassionate, and far-sighted philanthropic endeavors begun by his grandparents, Louis and Rachel Rudin, and enhanced by his parents, Samuel and May Rudin. A Benefactor of the University and its Albert Einstein College of Medicine through the May and Samuel Rudin Family Foundation and The Louis and Rachel Rudin Foundation, he provided hundreds of scholarships for students and support for research in cancer and AIDS at Einstein, and supported programs in Talmudic studies at the University's affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. This quintessential New Yorker's life was truly a blessing. We extend heartfelt condolences to his wife, Rachel; Jack and his wife, Susan; daughter, Beth Rudin De Woody; son, William C. Rudin, and wife, Ophelia; and to the grandchildren and all members of the bereaved family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.

Belfer, Chairperson, Board of Overseers Dr. Dominick P. Purpura, The Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean    RUDIN-Lewis. The Board of Directors, staff and residents of The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale mourn with deep sorrow the untimely passing of Lewis Rudin, a man of unbounded generosity and exceptional personal warmth. Lew Rudin, along with his brother Jack and their extraordinary family, became highly successful businessmen and always believed that their good fortune was a gift to be shared with others. And share they did, with people in need in New York, Israel and around the world. Lew and Jack Rudin's gifts to The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale through the May and Samuel Rudin Foundation that honors their parents, will enable us to extend our high quality services to embrace more older persons. Their support of Project HOPE (Healthcare Offers Permanent Employment), conducted by The Hebrew Home since 1992, has provided an enriched setting, alternative education and vocational programs for students at risk, helping the youngsters graduate from high school and enter the health field. We were pleased to honor Lew and Jack Rudin at our annual dinner in 1993. The Hebrew Home extends its condolences to Lew's beloved wife Rachel; daughter Beth DeWoody; son William and daughter-in-law Ophelia; four grandchildren; brother Jack; and all who loved him, and the thousands whose lives were improved by his selflessness and vision. Milton A. Gilbert, President Bernard Goldberg, Chairman Daniel A. Reingold, Exec. VP    RUDIN-Lewis. The Columbia University community is deeply saddened by the loss of Lewis Rudin, whose devotion and commitment to NYC, its institutions of higher education and civic and philanthropic organizations has enriched the lives of all who love our city. He was a tireless champion of the city's cultural, civic, academic and philanthropic organizations and extolled the many virtues of the city as a founder and supporter of the Association for a Better New York. At Columbia, we are grateful for all he did to extend and support the enrichment of so many young lives. He generously established the Rudin scholarships, which will uphold the devotion he had for goodness and decency by inspiring civic commitment among our best students. His legacy will continue for generations to come in the good works of many deserving students. We will miss him. George Rupp President Columbia University David J.

The most mega mega-merger in history reduced the imminent presidential primaries to quaint sideshows, relics of a distant age flickering along the fringes of the evening news. Press and public alike instinctively recognized that the first (though hardly the last) consummated marriage between new media and old is going to shape our lives long after we've forgotten which politician had which health or tax-cut plan.    The excitement and trepidation generated by this deal is in part about money and Wall Street valuations, sure. But its lasting effect lies in the sheer velocity and impact of seismic cultural change. The unofficial precursor of AOL Time Warner synergy, the movie ''You've Got Mail,'' came out just a year ago and has already been outrun by Internet time. In that picture, the big chain bookstores were driving the little independents out of business. But now -- according to a new Andersen Consulting survey buried under Monday's avalanche of merger news -- those big bookstores are themselves being routed by the Net.
