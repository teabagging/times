The windowsills under my      house plants are sticky, and so are the windows and some of the leaves. Is this bad, and what does it mean? -- Melissa B. Colton, Harrisburg, Pa.     A.  It's certainly not good. Sticky droppings that stain windowsills, windowpanes and sometimes the floor around house plants are a sign that insects are afoot. What you're seeing is the honeydew of insects -- aphids, scale insects or both. It's not uncommon to see this residue before you see the creatures that excrete it.   Aphids come in assorted colors, most commonly pale green and black, and tend to gather on new leaves or new stems. Scale insects tend to be more solitary, appearing as whitish or brownish lumps along stems and leaf tops or bottoms, often along the veins. Although these insects can be removed by hand, you might prefer applying a solution of soap and water once a week, which will wash away the residue as well as the bugs.   Soaps have long been an ally in the battle against bugs","excerpt":"whale-oil soap was a favorite of fruit growers in the 19th century. A sudsy mix of any liquid soap may suffice, but insecticidal soaps, made for this purpose, are more reliable. They are available at garden centers. Some plants, however, are sensitive to soaps, so read the label first.  Floppy Crops    Q.     I love beans and other floppy crops, but have no patience with tying them onto poles. Is there something better? -- Armand Schulte, Washington.     A.  Quite a few interesting structures are useful for supporting crops like tomatoes, squash, melons, beans and peas. One of the simplest, if not among the most handsome, is a wire cage that goes around the plant. A two- or three-foot wide cage four- to five-feet high will suffice for many plants. A better looking support that is almost as easy to use as the wire cage is a tepee-style structure of three or four poles, about six- to nine-feet tall, tied together at the top. Twine or wire placed horizontally around the poles often add plant support. This system can be used for a row of plants by adding a thin pole across the top of the tepees. Another support is an A-frame made of wood lattice, heavy twine or wire.    Decorative and practical supports for edible plants are discussed in \\"Trellising,\\" a new book by Rhonda Massingham Hart (Storey Communications, $21.95 hard-cover, $10.95 paper; (800) 827-8673). Dying Daffodils    Q.     I like daffodils but dislike the long period needed for their foliage to ripen. Do any species mature faster, and if not, how long do I have to wait before cutting the leaves off? -- Se     lene Sheriff, Bethesda, Md.      A.  You're wise to be concerned; a hasty removal of daffodil foliage may prevent the formation of the bud for next year's flower. \\"I don't know of any kinds of daffodils whose leaves mature faster than others,\\" said Mary Lou Gripshover, executive director of the American Daffodil Society. She did, however, suggest planting earlier-blooming varieties like Prologue or Court Martial.    \\"Most catalogues state approximately when the bulbs will flower,\\" she said. \\"But as for coping with the leaves, it's not a good idea to tie, braid or put a rubber band around ripening foliage since that decreases the leaf surface that's exposed to sunlight.\\"    She said that you can remove all the leaves six weeks after the flowers have finished. This interval was established after research was done in England by the Royal Horticultural Society. In the study, leaves in several control beds were cut at various intervals, while in other beds the leaves were allowed to die by themselves. \\"The experiment showed that the six-week time frame was sufficient for the leaves to ripen and the following year's flower buds to form,\\" Ms. Gripshover said.    If you enjoy these glorious spring bloomers, you might also enjoy belonging to the Daffodil Society. Annual dues are $20.

(St. Martin's, $22.95.) There is a hint of pretentiousness about books on whole nations that are titled with a \\"the\\" -- as in \\"The Germans\\" or \\"The Russians.\\" But let us see -- does the author deliver? David Marsh, chief German correspondent of the London Financial Times, has updated the 1989 British edition of his book, \\"The Germans,\\" with some cutting and pasting to bring us beyond the fall of the Berlin wall, the collapse of the Communist system in East Germany and the express-train rush toward unification of the two German states. His thesis is that \\"Germany's destiny will shape the future of Europe\\" either to the Continent's benefit or to its risk. So far, so good, although I think one could argue with equal force that Europe's destiny will shape the future of Germany, as it has increasingly in recent decades. But to propose to inform readers about the nation and then largely or completely ignore the women of Germany, the writers of Germany, the film makers of Germany and even some of the major postwar politicians like Herbert Wehner or Theodor Heuss who played central roles in shaping modern Germany is to leave yawning gaps. \\"The Germans\\" is further marred by sloppy and turgid writing, awkward usages like \\"ecumenicalism\\" -- to describe the role of a church in northern Germany -- and an excess of material taken over unrevised from the previous edition that is now obsolete or irrelevant. On the plus side, Mr. Marsh has dealt at some length with the still unresolved problem of German national identity, which is the core of understanding this strange people, and with demography -- the peculiarity of a declining birth rate for the Germans themselves and the burgeoning of foreign-born people in their midst, now exceeding 5 million in what was West Germany. The best material in this book may be the lengthy quotations the author has assembled in the course of numerous interviews with politicians, bankers and some less extraordinary Germans. They at least give a sense of how contemporary Germans think about themselves and their world. Mr. Marsh is far less eloquent than his subjects.

For several of the owners, their appearance in court was part of an ongoing process of repeat performances, some having been involved in cases embracing as many as 100 separate violations.   Throughout the proceedings, Judge Davis's courtroom manner remained sympathetic but relentlessly single-minded.

Most East Coast bass populations have been declining steadily since 1974, and commercial landings reached a 30-year low in 1979.  Spawning success has fallen drastically in many areas and the reasons for this are not clear. In some instances it has been the degradation of spawning habitat. The striper is an anadromous fish, procreating in freshwater with the offspring, after varying periods of time, dropping down to saltwater to attain maturity. The adults usually return to the saltwater shortly after spawning is done.   Increased commercial and sport fishing pressure has also been a factor in the striper's decline, as has the harvesting of the fish on their spawning grounds. And as the fish have grown scarce, the price paid for them has risen, and there have been instances of ungutted bass bringing $3 a pound to the fishermen at dockside.   To complicate matters more, there have always been as yet unexplained natural fluctuations in striper populations even in times when man's intrusion on the natural scheme was much less than it is now.

This current effort is based on a Paul Armstrong play and it enjoys the distinction of being perhaps the first film of its kind in which only one shot is fired. The irritating specimen of humanity whose career is suddenly ended by the small piece of lead is not even permitted any extravagant death scene","excerpt":"what happens to him is largely left to the imagination.The cool attitude of Detective Edwin Burke in this shadow yarn recalls the demeanor of the sleuth in \\"Broadway,\\" but the story is totally different. Detective Burke seems almost on the point of yawning when he is doing his fastest thinking. He is a student of crook psychology whose nonchalance baffles the malefactors. An attempt to bluff him brings a lazy smile to his face. While the denouement of this tale virtually makes him an accessory before the fact, one is impelled to think that Burke's idea of pitting one crook against another is not a bad way of killing two birds with one stone.\\"Romance of the Underworld\\" is blessed with subtlety and good humor. Whether Mr. Cummings is dealing with scenes in the crooks' hangout or a more wholesome side of life, he gives to his work a charming imaginative quality that inveigles the attention. In his direction of Robert Elliott, who so brilliantly portrays the sympathetic Burke, Mr. Cummings refrains from exaggeration, keeping to a human thinking portrait.A nice sense of humor darts here and there even in the romantic episodes, in which Mary Astor and John Boles are the players. Judith Andrews (Miss Astor), who, through a flat purse is forced to take the displeasing work of a so-called hostess in a speakeasy, eventually, on the night of a raid, quits the murky atmosphere and goes to toil in a laundry. Afterward she becomes a waitress and eventually, through studying typewriting and stenography, she finds a position in an office. Fortune smiles upon her and she becomes the wife of the vice president of the business, Stephen Ransome, played by John Boles.On the day that Judith and Stephen are to be married in the chambers of a judge, a friend of Stephen, Derby Dan Manning, is brought up for sentence. Dan is one of the crooks whom Judith encountered in her unfortunate days. Dan is sentenced to two years, and, so soon as he is released from jail he goes to Judith's home and gains entrance by posing as the man who had come to repair the radio. He blackmails Judith and, when she orders him from the apartment, he grasps her by the arm and snatches a bracelet and a ring. The thug then tells Judith that he will return the jewelry if she will bring him $5,000 in cash that night.Judith has her own idea of dealing with Dan. She goes to see Burke, whom she first met on the night of the speakeasy raid, and Burke in his own cool way settles with Dan through Champagne Joe, whom Dan had double-crossed.There may be nothing original about a young woman secretary eventually marrying her wealthy young employer, but there is something decidedly original in the way in which Burke handles Derby Dan and thus saves Judith from the worry of satisfying the demands of a blackmailer.Miss Astor is capital in her part. So is Mr. Boles in his rôle. Ben Bard, ever rubbing his shoes on his trouser leg, gives an excellent performance as Derby Dan. But the outstanding acting of the picture is that contributed by Mr. Elliott as Burke.Mr. Rothafel's stage offerings are especially charming. Harold Van Duzee, Douglas Stanbury and Florence Rogge distinguished themselves in a sketch called, \\"The Clown.\\" Another enjoyable feature is \\"In Holland,\\" with Patricia Bowman and Russell E. Markert's extraordinarily competent dancers.The subjects on the Movietone newsreel include glimpses of world statesmen at Lugano. Dr. Stresemann delivers a brief message to the American people. Then there is the autogyro airplane. Another feature shows Miss Nancy Samuel, daughter of Britain's former Home Secretary, who is heard declaring herself in favor of the American girl, but voicing criticism of the appearance of men of this country. Following flashes of Gibraltar, General Sir Alexander Godley, the Governor of the \\"Rock,\\" says a few words. Another bit of talking film deals with Howard Coffin and President Coolidge, who indulge in a little levity on taxation while in an ox-drawn cart.The inauguration of Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, with addresses from both the new Governor and Alfred E. Smith, is another interesting talking feature. THE SCREEN; A Nonchalant Sleuth. Who Is the Killer? Giddy Comedy.

The rest of the year we tend to rely on professionals, who have come to hold a fairly exalted place in our musical life. Indeed, it is hardly stretching things to assert that the main reason most of today's concert-going public goes to concerts is to hear performers, not to hear music. The public craves performers, the more glamorous, the better.   Without a guest soloist or ''name'' conductor, an orchestral concert risks going half-attended, regardless of the repertory. A recital by one of the music world's recognized ''superstars,'' however - a virtuoso like Vladimir Horowitz, or a vocalist like Luciano Pavarotti - is an ''event,'' and an almost-certain guarantee of a sold-out house. Listeners have always seemed willing to pay the high ticket prices necessitated by the high fees such artists charge.    There is nothing wrong with this adulation of performers. But from time to time one hears grumblings about the imbalance it creates in musical life. ''Why does the public celebrate performers at the expense of the living composer?'' some ask.

In summer the dowry of the world turns Day-Glo","excerpt":"what in autumn will be somber, hemstitched, restrained, in summer is silly, outre, a mess. The shy student who in October will wear a black beret enlivened by one small diamante pin in summer slouches slack-jawed by the water, wearing a hat the color of a tiger lily. To Henry Adams, writing about his boyhood in New England a century and a half ago, summer was drunken and winter was school. When I was a child my parents owned a bungalow in the woods with a view of a cove; when we arrived I would go around the back of the house and look for my reflection, 11 months older, in the kitchen window. The bayberry and scrub pine shone greenly through me so that I became, in the wavy kitchen glass, not a product of the heavy, ponderous year but a mirage, a figment of summer.  For the last 15 or 20 years, through the Indian summer of adolescence, through marriage and motherhood, I have worn exactly the same clothes in August; paradoxically, it is the month in which I have thought most elaborately about clothes. In other months I have dressed like a mountaineer, like Hippolyta, like a French chambermaid, like a schoolboy, like Janis Joplin. Some years it is a wearing business, and sometimes it is less so.   Through it I observe with passion and awe my friends whose dress stays constant: for a time I worked alongside a woman who had made whatever economies were necessary to wear only clothes by Sonia Rykiel. One morning she appeared in a Missoni jacket; it was as if she had joined a vaudeville troupe and changed her name. I am deeply envious of what others might see as obsession but I see as organization of a high order; this envy accompanies my desire for the contemplative life, for convents and the hush of long corridors, for vespers and ecclesiastical dress. In this guise I imagine myself aging in a small but not provincial town -- Vezelay or Bevagna -- wearing a wool skirt by Valentino, a blouse and very good shoes, worn but cared for.   But in August the costume designer in me is visiting her aged mother in Cap d'Antibes. Content in her absence I wear an Indian-print wrap skirt, old enough for a coming-out party, and a gray T-shirt with a picture of a steer and a slogan that reads, \\"TEXAS RANGERS.\\" I have no affiliation with Texas, nor any with the location advertised by my other summer shirt: \\"The Beurre Blanc Yacht Club.\\" I have a pair of gray shorts, a pair of mustard, too-short linen pants from Fiorucci that were given over to me by the first wife of a childhood sweetheart, and a sundress printed with menacing tropical fish. There is also a cotton jacket in an unpleasant shade of blue. None of these garments is remotely becoming. They smell of salt, and I cling to them because they are my summer skin. Years ago my mother had a pink hooded sweatshirt that she wore at the beach. During the winter months of exile from the ocean I would go to the cupboard and bury my face in it.   If we are lucky, as children in summer we are covered in salt and sand and scratched by brambles; we don't think for a minute about what we wear because we live in our skins. Ten years later on the same spit of sand we think without ceasing about what we wear because we have become naked in the garden; we fear not the sun but the harsh, curious gazes of our friends. When we grow up, we live again in our skins; we care, but not as desperately, about our bodies, which have after all been put to use and which in any case are buried in the sand every day by our children. Like workers on a vast plain we wear large hats to shield our faces from the sun; our bathing suits are like armor for beetles.   A moment later it is September. Like children we pull up our socks, buckle our shoes, button our overcoats, but the questions for those of us still deep in the dress-up box are: What socks? Which shoes? Whose overcoat?   I cling to my summer clothes as a charm both for and against change. To wear them is to become again the mirage in the window who, for that moment, could be anyone, but who still needs, come the fall, to get dressed; to wear them is evidence that, indeed, as anyone can see, I have nothing to wear. \\"Beware of all enterprises that require new clothes,\\" wrote Thoreau. Beware, comes a voice, of those that don't. \\"Three prs. black tights,\\" \\"School shoes (green suede??),\\" \\"Brown velvet dress p. 83,\\" read the lists that surface now and then, written decades ago, as I sat with my mother on the beach studying the premature fall fashion magazines, from which sheathed, impossibly elegant versions of ourselves beckoned like silent screen stars. \\"WHITE dress. Buckles?\\" reads a later, cryptic list.  It is an easy thing to do at the edge of the water: to rummage among the bright pages for a scarf, a hat, an evening gown, here at the tail end of summer, where the earliest creatures first crawled out on land and tried on their new shadows.

Since no permanent member had \\"vetoed\\" the resolution, that is, voted against it, the president of the Council declared it adopted. In so doing, he was circumventing the explicit provisions of the United Nations Charter by resorting to a legal fiction that has been used innumerable times since the earliest days of the world organization.   The point is that the United Nations Charter says nothing about a veto","excerpt":"what it does contain is a so-called \\"unanimity rule.\\" Article 27, paragraph 3, of the Charter states quite unambiguously that Security Council decisions on all matters other than purely procedural ones \\"shall be made by an affirmative vote of 9 members including the concurring votes of the permanent members.\\" Thus, a draft resolution is killed just as effectively by an abstention as by a negative vote or \\"veto.\\"   The famous \\"veto,\\" which has been around as long as the United Nations itself, was strictly a creation of the press. A Security Council resolution was said to have been vetoed if a permanent member voted against it, and the notion thereupon took hold that if a permanent member merely abstained, the resolution passed.   Since it was rarely possible to obtain big power unanimity on any matter of real consequence, the United Nations was only too happy to go along with this misconception. Winking at the Charter enabled a permanent member to register its disapproval of a resolution without assuming the onus of scuttling it.   The proper course would be to amend the Charter. However, that might be politically difficult and would involve an embarrassing admission of 45 years of legal hanky-panky. The charade serves a useful purpose and will no doubt continue indefinitely.

By the following year, however, visiting naturalists began to observe the return of life to the island, starting with a couple of spiders and blades of grass. By 1886, 34 plant species were counted, including blue-green algae, mosses and some ferns; by 1897, there were 61. A few years later, the island was once again enveloped in life.   I thought about Krakatau in the spring as I watched life colonize my new pond -- determinedly, improbably, astonishingly. Five months before, there had been only a raw, sterile-looking crater out here in the woods behind my house, a kind of scaled-down, concave Krakatau. It, too, had had its origins in violence, which often seems to attend the birth of ponds made by animals like us. My own began with the howl of chain saws, the screech of a chipper big enough to devour trees thick as thighs, and then the gut-tightening roar of heavy earth-moving machinery. For two days in October, my house shook, as a mammoth front-end loader, working together with a bulldozer in a kind of rough, elephantine dance, plunged its toothed bucket into the earth's surface, tearing first through the thin, living skin of black humus and then deep into progressively lighter layers of subsoil to a depth of 12 feet, where life is all but undetectable.

What I find difficult to believe is that any minimally informed person thinks our national security was threatened by Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.   With no effort at all, I can understand how United States security is threatened by our inadequate response to the schools, to insufficient medical care, to rampant racism and crime, to collapsing banks and to crumbling cities and infrastructure. With a bit of effort, I can understand how United States security might be threatened by the turmoil in Eastern Europe. But no effort has convinced me that United States security was at stake in the Persian Gulf.   Also disturbing is Mr. Gelb's description of the crushing of Iraq as a \\"triumph\\" for President Bush and his aides. Before proceeding with the killing, Mr. Bush insisted the United States had no quarrel with the Iraqi people, only with Saddam Hussein.

You look as if you are trying to get where you are going even if you are sitting by a pool in Cali. I was preparing for a party. I was trying to organize. Then we started talking about our block. There is a Buddhist family down the block whose whole house is decorated like a temple. Another guy is a basketball player who's seven feet tall and lives with his parents. Then there's this couple who dress like Ricky and Lucy. It's a crazy block. It's like driving down a dream.    Tatsuya Ishida (right), 26  That patio is the neutral space, where we talk. The couch had some roaches. The cigarette butts pile up. We try to keep in the place clean, but never really succeed until our maid comes. We had been sitting there all day, just hanging out, trying to being characters. We were putting in the effort to have a good time -- or a mellow time, at least. I remember being very reserved and cautious. I felt my social skills were not adequate. It's the camera that makes me a bit shy. It's a weird gut feeling. I don't want to have my image stolen. If there's going to be evidence later of what transpired, I better be on my best behavior.

After like eight or nine years of being together, they had just gotten married. The day was good. My mother was happy. My stepfather was talking about putting me in charge of the house because they were getting ready to leave for Hawaii. I was just thinking about them leaving and having the house to myself. I was gonna throw a party. It feels strange being at a wedding. It was long, real long. I was thinking, I ain't getting married -- it's too much. You've got to organize everything. I just don't want that. I don't want to stay with one person for the rest of my life. I will probably change my mind, though. I'll probably fall in love.''    Adele Lucas  ''I was thinking about all my older sister and my mother did for the wedding. They made all the knickknacks and the cake -- everything. I wanted it all to be unforgettable. I told my kids it would shine that day. It was beautiful. They had to say I was right. I was glad it was over. I was calm. I was thinking, Now I have a new husband and I finally got it right. And I was getting ready to go on my honeymoon to Hawaii. I stayed in the dress while we waited for the limo man. Nicholas was playing around, saying, 'I am coming with you, Mom.' He's a kidder. Jeffrey was like, 'Nicholas, me and your mom are going all alone.'''    Jeffrey Lucas  'The day was so crazy. I am so ashamed to say that I was late to my own wedding. But it worked out fine because everybody was happy. Then we were getting ready to leave for our honeymoon. We were really pressed for time. Adele couldn't even get out of her gown because she was still packing, and I was driving her crazy -- 'Come on, we've got a plane.' I am one of those people who wants everything to be right before they go on a trip. I was just so hyped. My son, Nicholas, was trying to help us get it all together. I was thinking about how Hawaii would be. And I was thinking, Did I really do this?''

While the production's lost souls waited, they danced.   The choreography that Adriana Barenstein created for this company from Buenos Aires was particularly striking when it ignored a basic command of many stage directors: don't turn your back to the audience. For much of the first section of the work, the dancers -- Mariana Bellotto, Patricia Dorin, Marta Lantermo, Sergio Pletikosic and Alejandro Polledo -- sat in deck chairs or stood in stoic calm while staring out to sea with their backs to the audience.

A new report of the Group of 30, a high-level body of international economic and monetary experts and government officials led by H. Johannes Witteveen, former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, recognizes that it is in the short-term interest of the importing countries that real oil prices continue to decline because this will reduce inflation, improve balances of payments and stimulate economic recovery.   But the report contends that this conflicts with ''the long-term economic interest in effecting a smooth transition from the present energy regime, which still reflects the historic reliance on low-cost energy sources, to a future one likely to be based on higher costs.'' Instability is in the interest of neither importers nor exporters. A steep, disorderly fall in oil prices and a drop in OPEC's capital surplus, it says, may put ''additional strains on an already troubled financial system.''

Unless Beijing knows that we will not tolerate the executions, jailings and other abuses detailed -- and predicted -- in the new Asia Watch report, we are bound to see even greater repressions mainly at the hands of the newly reinvigorated People's Liberation Army.   After years of giving the military the lowest priority on its list of \\"four modernizations,\\" Beijing has increased its military budget by a whopping 15.2 percent. With the cold war ended and the major powers agreeing to reduce their strategic and conventional forces, and with the Soviet and Vietnamese borders quiet, there are hardly any fresh external threats to warrant the increased emphasis on the military. The only plausible explanation is the post-Tiananmen preoccupation of Beijing's leaders with securing and maintaining control of the country, and their decision to make the army their chief instrument of control.   Until now, army loyalty to the political leadership was not a certainty: some commanders refused to use their troops against the pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen, and afterward there were murmurs of dissension in the ranks over the crackdown's brutality. This apparently led Deng Xiaoping, Li Peng and their colleagues to conclude that they must be assured of the army's absolute loyalty to be sure of maintaining power themselves. Accordingly, they recently placed new emphasis on political and ideological indoctrination: troops must now attend daily one-and-a-half-hour political sessions, and officers through the highest ranks must also attend appropriate classes. Through these measures, and the new infusion of funds to keep the commanders happy, Beijing's leaders expect to have at their command a loyal and powerful military whose main mission will be the suppression of dissent among the Chinese people.   We can do little to prevent the strengthening of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but we can do things to curb its use. For example, the greater budgetary allotment to the military means fewer allocations for economic development. We can therefore make trade, investments and other aspects of economic cooperation contingent upon the tolerance of dissent and the reduction, if not elimination of arbitrary arrests and executions. We can also stop behaving as if China did us a favor by siding with us in the Middle East crisis: it did so out of desire to better its overall relations with us, and because it did not want to jeopardize its growing ties with Saudi Arabia, which it recently wooed away diplomatically from Taiwan.   We have the ways to put pressure on the Chinese Government to make it observe basic norms of decent human conduct","excerpt":"what we need is the will.

Slightly more than half the deaths from heart disease in the United States now occur among women, and this share is likely to increase as the population ages.   But what are women doing to stem this rise, particularly those in their 50's and 60's, the decades when their coronary death rate begins its steep climb? Not nearly enough, according to recently published reports. Women with two or more major controllable coronary risk factors -- cigarette smoking, lack of physical activity, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes and overweight -- are more the norm than the exception. Three factors -- smoking, sedentary habits and overweight -- were featured in recent reports.  Addiction to Nicotine    The United States Public Health Service estimated that in 1990, 61,000 American women over 35 died from cardiovascular diseases caused by smoking. The chances of suffering a heart attack can be cut in half within just one year of quitting smoking, but only 2.5 percent of women who smoke successfully quit each year.

But if you are one of the fashion avant-garde, you are already eyeing the 40's. Such is the way the style pendulum swings these days. Each thrust forward brings a swoop backward. For their spring collections, designers have obviously dug deep into the lore of the 60's. They've brought back the structured dress -- shaped like an \\"A,\\" short of skirt and often sleeveless. The color palette is on the bright side -- plenty of white and sunny shades like grass green, orange, peony pink and peach. Sixties-style accessories are back as well, especially the pointed-toe shoe, head kerchiefs, headbands and ladylike wrist-handle bags. All these ideas have caught on like wildfire, and stores will soon have versions of them at every price level. Then there is the hint of 1950's fashion reappearing, mostly in the form of prim and proper suits. One signal is that Karl Lagerfeld, the designer for Chanel, is suggesting them. So can the 1940's be far behind? Of course not. In Isaac Mizrahi's new collection, there are just a few breezy outfits with pronounced waistlines and fuller, longer skirts.

Toasted bread spread with garlic-flavored aioli is offered alongside a bottle of extra-virgin olive oil. Guests can reconstitute the original dish, eat only the fish or pile a plate high with vegetables, while either resisting or taking the condiments.

Back in the 19th century, ladies had idly cut figures out of photographs and made them straggle across album pages. Turn-of-the-century photographers had cobbled together postcard pictures of things like railroad cars straining to carry apples as big as Moby Dick.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 9.    Now Playing  * ''AFFLICTION,'' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn (winner of the Oscar for best-supporting actor), Willem Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Mr. Coburn, terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Mr. Schrader, this pure, unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks's novel starts on a deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury. Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).   * ''ANALYZE THIS,'' starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an offer you can't refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, Mr. De Niro is hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic goodfella style. His mobster finds just the right comic foil in Billy Crystal, as the psychiatrist who utters the immortal: ''When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind.'' There's a lot more where that came from in this breezy comic treat (Maslin).   ''BABY GENIUSES,'' starring Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd and many toddlers. Directed by Bob Clark (PG, 94 minutes). One way to get through this guaranteed 100 percent laugh-free comedy is to wonder whether it really is the worst film you've even seen.  Probably not, but it's pretty darn close. Woefully substandard production values give it a ghastly look, made all the worse by the grotesque computer morphing of young children into adult-style wise guys. The plotting is shrill, bordering on incomprehensible. Ms. Turner lurches through the film with a performance that just says, ''Hey, it's a living'' (Maslin).   * ''CENTRAL STATION,'' starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Mr. Salles's film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Mr. Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's very best (Maslin).   ''THE CORRUPTOR,'' starring Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg. Directed by James  Foley (R, 111 minutes). A conventional but above-average police drama set in Chinatown  in New York City, ''The Corruptor'' finds the rookie cop Danny Wallace (Mr. Wahlberg) learning the ropes from his rule-bending partner, Nick Chen (Mr. Chow), who has gotten dangerously chummy with Chinatown's mob bosses. The atmosphere is gritty, the action sequences sleek and the questions the story raises about loyalty, ethics, friendship and betrayal, although familiar, are still worth  bringing up. ''The Corruptor'' is a more effective showcase for the brooding charisma of Mr. Chow, a Hong Kong action superstar, than ''The Replacement Killers,'' his English-language debut (Stephen Holden).   * ''THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN,'' starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Whoopi Goldberg and Jonathan Jackson. Directed by Ulu Grosbard (PG-13, 108 minutes).  Ms. Pfeiffer gives a fine, affecting performance in this adaptation of Jacquelyn Mitchard's best seller. And Mr. Grosbard carefully delineates its story of a child's disappearance and its aftermath, showing the ways that such a catastrophe affects his family. Restrained and unsentimental, this astute drama deals thoughtfully with the chasm between real and idealized family lives (Maslin).   ''EIGHT MILLIMETER,'' starring Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Myra Carter and Catherine Keener. Directed by Joel Schumacher (R, 120 minutes). This thriller delves into the perverse underworld of the pornography business, shocking audiences with the realization that sex and violence can be so dull. Mr. Cage, seriously miscast, plays a private detective and devoted family man who is suddenly, to his horror, drawn into the realm of porn. Naturally, this is where the film wanted to be even when its opening scenes were stuck in suburban Pennsylvania. But the story's parade of New York and Hollywood sleazeballs fails to deliver either engaging drama or heartfelt kinks. Mr. Phoenix is scene-stealingly good in a sidekick's role (Maslin).   ''ELIZABETH,'' the Oscar winner for best makeup. Starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124 minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Elizabeth I as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the Queen as if her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled, selecting consorts and saying ''Leave us!'' with a wave of the hand. For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, this is historical drama for those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene reminiscent of ''Saturday Night Fever,'' it winds up imagining the Queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman afflicted by a super-intense case of having it all (Maslin).     ''FORCES OF NATURE,'' starring Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck. Directed by Bronwen Hughes (PG-13, 102 minutes). Does Ms. Bullock's loopy girl-next-door charm really make audiences want to follow her anywhere?  If so, they'd better be prepared for an amusement park ride with senior citizens, a long romp through K-mart and the other equally desperate settings for a road movie that otherwise has nowhere to go. A would-be screwball romantic comedy about a man thrown together with a zany drifter en route to his own wedding, it shows off Ms. Bullock to amusing if overly frenetic advantage. Mr. Affleck fares less well with the film's wimpier role. Some of the material's many gaps are filled by special-effects hail and windstorms, which are as close as the title comes to making any sense (Maslin).   * ''LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL'' (winner of the best-foreign-film Oscar), directed by and starring Roberto Benigni (named best actor) (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to find humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly entertaining as its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more somber second act, Mr. Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear (Maslin).   * ''LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,'' starring Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Sting, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran. Directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since ''The Usual Suspects'' has there been such an oversupply of cool macho schemers in a single film. And they're served up with a quick, tart economy that bespeaks the filmmaker's background making videos and commercials -- actually an advantage, for a change. There's not much beneath the surface here","excerpt":"what's most entertaining is Mr. Ritchie's droll, hard-boiled storytelling and the rogue's gallery of a cast that he has assembled. All the film need do is juggle assorted miscreants and four separate gangs who, figuratively speaking, can't shoot straight (Maslin).   ''PAYBACK,'' starring Mel Gibson, James Coburn and Gregg Henry. Directed by Brian Helgeland (R, 110 minutes). In this inept, excessively sadistic film-noir spoof adapted from the same Richard Stark novel (''The Hunter'') that inspired the 1967 genre classic ''Point Blank,'' Mr. Gibson is a thief named Porter who retaliates with a vengeance after an attempt on his life. Determined to recover $70,000 that was stolen from him by a double-crossing partner in crime, he works his way up the pecking order of a crime syndicate, brutally dispatching all who stand in his way. The hard-boiled dialogue is ludicrous, the storytelling clunky, the acting fair to awful, the gore ankle deep. Credit the star with being able to keep a straight face through this loathsome mess (Holden).   * ''SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,'' Oscar winner for best cinematography, best editing, best sound and best sound-effects editing. Starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg. Directed by Steven Spielberg (winner of the best-director Oscar) (R, 168 minutes). Mr. Spielberg's soberly magnificent new film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning back the clock to restore passion and meaning to the genre, he works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at war as if it has not been looked at before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are frank without sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who made you believe there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet has made this an irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Mr. Hanks continues to astonish with admirable modesty, and the rest of the casting is comparably inspired. As he did with ''Schindler's List,'' Mr. Spielberg has made a landmark film of devastating power (Maslin).   * ''SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'' (the Oscar winner for best film, best original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best comedy score.) Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench (best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of ''Romeo and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).   * ''TANGO,'' starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and directed by Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (PG-13, 100 minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and virtuosity. And it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say that the dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most electrifying dance film, Mr. Saura offers transfixingly beautiful glimpses of the dance and the great range of emotions it can conjure. Mr. Storaro's dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the nuances this material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly consumed by tango fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).   ''THE THIN RED LINE,'' starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely derived from James Jones's Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear that Mr. Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style that made ''Badlands'' and ''Days of Heaven'' the most beautiful films of the 1970's is instantly apparent here, even if the narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar. The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter editing. Bottom line: No one who admired Mr. Malick's early work should miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it here (Maslin).   * ''TRUE CRIME,'' starring Clint Eastwood, Isaiah Washington, James Woods and Lisa Gay Hamilton. Directed by Clint Eastwood (R, 127 minutes). In his most quietly poignant film since ''A Perfect World,'' Mr. Eastwood directs a death row thriller with redemption on its mind. Beginning almost casually, and taking on growing urgency as it moves toward an imaginatively suspenseful ending, it tells of a jaded newspaper reporter who, to his own surprise as much as anyone else's, finds himself fighting at the 11th hour to save a possibly innocent man from execution. Mr. Eastwood is older than the man he plays, but not too old to be plausible as the father of an adorable little girl in the cast; she happens to be his real daughter (Maslin).

Question Of the Week","excerpt":"What's Wrong With The Mets?"},{"year":"1992","title":"On my first morning at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, Joe Frustaci, the woodworking director, stepped up to the dining-hall microphone after breakfast to read a poem that had been written on the back of a wooden heart by Shawn Valdez, a 9-year-old camper who has spent about half his life under treatment for leukemia. The poem was for a counselor named Wendy Whitehill -- Shawn's favorite person at the camp, unless you count Tadger, who lives in the woods rather than in the camp itself and may well be a bear. \\n\\nShawn -- a dark, frail-looking little boy with large brown eyes -- wasn't facing the microphone. He was sitting on Wendy's lap, with his arms around her neck. What Shawn had written on the heart was:\\n\\nWendy\\n I love your goldin hair\\n Gold as a sunrise\\n I love the way your blood\\n warms me up like tow eskimoes\\n snuggling.\\n I love your smile from\\n ear to ear\\n I love every\\n thing about you.\\n Shawn\\n\\n\\nI met Wendy a few minutes later. Actually, her hair didn't look quite as gold as a sunrise to me, but that may have been because of the light we were in. I said, \\"Shawn seems to find you an acceptable person.\\" \\n\\nShe smiled and nodded. One of the things that had most struck her about the camp, she said, was the widespread presence of \\"unconditional love.\\" Partly because all of the campers have been treated for diseases frightening enough to make schoolmates hesitant or even hostile, unconditional love is more or less camp policy. Children hug counselors. Counselors hug children. When Huggy Bear -- a bear suit inhabited by an adult, often Robert (Woody) Wilkins, the camp director -- delivers the mail from Tadger every morning at breakfast, he hugs everybody in sight. When a counselor is sitting down, he is likely to have a camper in his lap.\\n\\nThe Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, which was founded and continues to be energized by the actor Paul Newman, is an unconditional sort of place. It looks like the camp that summer-camp kids have always dreamed of when they were not dreaming of being back home in their own beds, just down the hall from their parents -- a shrewdly designed, dazzlingly equipped Wild West hideout in eastern Connecticut. The theater resembles the sort of place where dancing girls are about to appear on the stage to be hooted at by rowdies who have just come off a cattle drive. The lake is so well stocked that fish that really want to get caught may have to take a number. \\n\\nVisitors nearly always remark that the children enjoying these facilities -- who range in age from 7 to 15 -- look sort of, well, normal. The camp is specifically for children with cancer or serious blood disorders","excerpt":"what's wrong with them is on the inside. You might notice a child who is temporarily bald from the effects of chemotherapy or one whose growth has been stunted by the side effects of radiation or one who looks particularly thin; there might be a hemophilic boy (virtually all hemophiliacs are boys) who is in a wheelchair because he had a bleed into his spinal cord that couldn't be stopped. Some of the campers tire easily and some were in the hospital when other children their age were developing the hand-eye coordination it takes to look good on the tennis court.\\n\\nBut a dance I went to at the camp seemed at first glance to vary from a dance at an ordinary camp mainly in that campers and counselors and staff members were dancing without regard to age or size or gender, the way people sometimes do in the later stages of a particularly joyous wedding reception -- including a boy in a wheelchair whose derring-do must by now have inspired some medical center to post a sign saying \\"No Wheelie-Popping in Blood Lab Area.\\" After the dance, a swarm of children, still excited, burst into the infirmary to take care of whatever medical procedure -- an infusion of clotting factor, a fistful of pills, a battery-driven pump designed to rid the body of excess iron -- it takes to get them through the night. \\n\\nBy necessity, the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp is run largely through the infirmary. The closest thing to an admissions director is Sue Johnson, the head nurse, whose pool of applicants is gathered mainly through tertiary-care medical centers. She figures out, for instance, how many hemophiliacs can come to camp in any one session, since the constant need for factor makes them labor-intensive campers. (The diseases themselves impose a certain amount of racial and ethnic balance. Sickle-cell anemia afflicts mainly black people, and sicklers, as they're often called, tend to make up about a tenth of the children at the camp. One of the blood diseases, thalassemia, is so strongly associated with families of Italian and Greek origin that it is sometimes called Mediterranean anemia.) But the infirmary, a rough-wood building in the Western style, is not labeled \\"The Infirmary\\"; a sign outside says \\"The O.K. Corral.\\" Nobody working there wears a white coat. At the camp, medical treatment is supposed to be the engine that doesn't call attention to itself -- like the legendary assembly of pipes and cables and computers under Disney World.\\n\\nPaul Newman thought of the camp as a place where children would be able to escape doctors and hospitals for a while and just be campers. It savors the sort of traditions found in conventional camps. If someone is caught leaving the dining hall through the In door rather than the Out door, for instance, he has to stand in the middle of the dining hall and pantomime the words to the bushy-tail song. When Newman visits the camp -- he has built a cabin across the lake, and he's normally around for at least a day or two each 10-day session -- he always seems to stroll out through the In door, and he is caught by a pack of alert campers every time. Then he has to stand in the middle of the room, doing the appropriate motions, while everyone sings:\\n\\nPaul, Paul. \\n Shake your bushy tail.\\n Shake your bushy tail.\\n Wrinkle up your little nose.\\n Stick your head between your toes\\n Shake your bushy tail.\\n\\n\\nAs far as I could tell, the only reminder of medicine in the regular camp program is a form of action painting that children in arts and crafts like to do with syringes. Dahlia Lithwick, one of two former counselors who have put together a book of writings by Shawn Valdez and other campers called \\"I Will Sing Life: Voices From the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp,\\" told me that the older girls in her cabin always spent the conventional amount of time discussing who might be going to the dance with whom. On the other hand, she thinks that campers tend to see their counselors as grown-ups who, unlike parents, don't have to be protected -- campers are likely to have spent a lot of time seeing parents with what Shawn's mother calls in the book \\"tear eyes\\" -- so the question asked a counselor after the dance could be, \\"I don't want to freak you out, but why do you think God picked me to die?\\" \\n\\nThe counselor asked such a question will more than likely be freaked out. Although a few of the counselors have had childhood cancer themselves, the camp, which had its first summer in 1988, hasn't been in operation long enough to produce a supply of counselors from former campers. Most of the counselors are college students who have led relatively protected lives, and most of them arrive, in the words of a letter quoted in Newman's introduction for \\"I Will Sing Life,\\" with \\"a natural terror of disease, and a couple of books about coping with grief bought in a panic the previous week.\\"\\n\\nFor them, the experience of being at the camp tends to be intense, partly because of the constant juxtaposition of life-threatening illness and problems like who is going to the dance with whom. When Huggy Bear comes through the dining hall, the counselors who jump up to get hugged are partly just joining in, the way they join in the bushy-tail song and the dancing, but some of them may well feel the need of some hugging.\\n\\nTHE HOLE IN THE Wall Gang Camp is not, in fact, a camp for dying children. The overwhelming majority of campers, Sue Johnson says, \\"have a lot to put up with, but they're not terminal.\\" According to Carroll W. Brewster, a former college president who is the executive director of the Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, \\"the theory is that every child here is going to be an adult and needs a good childhood to become one\\" -- meaning that the camp sees its business as returning to the campers some of the childhood they've lost to illness and treatment. \\n\\nOn the theory that the proper work of childhood is learning and having fun, the camp concentrates on the equivalent of putting the children back to work -- teaching horseback riding even if the hemophiliacs have to be given a shot of factor before getting on the horse, for instance, or letting everyone go swimming even if the tendency of sicklers to be thrown into a pain crisis by a chill means that the pool has to be particularly warm and a gazebo next to it is outfitted with heat lamps in the ceiling.\\n\\nThe heated gazebo is known locally as the Pearson French-Fryer Warmer, after Howard A. Pearson, the Yale pediatrician who molded Newman's vision into what became the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. When Newman was casting around for advice on how to establish a camp in Connecticut for children with cancer, Pearson was the chairman of pediatrics at Yale Medical School and the Yale-New Haven Hospital. His advice seemed to extend naturally into participation. Pearson has been the medical director at the camp from the beginning. He also served for a couple of years as executive director of the Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, which annually raises the $2 million it takes to run a camp that has dazzling equipment but no fees. He's a low-key, grandfatherly man -- not the sort of person who finds being a camp doctor beneath the station of an eminent professor who this year is also the president-elect of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\\n\\nIt was Pearson who recommended that children with blood disorders as well as children with cancer be part of the camp mix. Partly because so much of childhood cancer is leukemia, there has always been a strong overlap in pediatrics between oncology and hematology. Pearson's own research interest is genetic blood disorders. Although the camp now has a couple of special sessions for campers with a single ailment -- one for sickle-cell, one for immunological disorders, including HIV infection -- Pearson says that a mix is salutary for the general sessions, partly because there is something about any serious disease or its treatment that can make someone with another serious disease count his blessings. \\n\\nIn fact, the camp is one place where a child who has had cancer may have reason to feel in an enviable position, although I suspect that would be a hard proposition to sell to a 10-year-old who's in the middle of an intense course of chemotherapy. The campers who have had a diagnosis of cancer -- normally about two-thirds of the 120 children in a regular session -- have almost all been through chemotherapy, and some of them have also had surgery and radiation. But the ones who have completed their treatment are likely to lead lives that are not dominated or shortened by disease: the cure rate for the most common type of childhood leukemia is now approaching 80 percent. \\n\\nThat's not true of the sicklers, who are never through with the pain crises and whose bodies tend to give out in their 40's or 50's. Because of considerable progress in recent years in the treatment of hemophilia -- mainly the invention of a process to manufacture clotting factor, making constant blood transfusions unnecessary -- it appeared for a while that many hemophiliacs would have to face futures of only inconvenience and enormous expense rather than inevitable crippling and early death. But until 1985, the factor supply was not screened for HIV, so about half of the hemophiliacs at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp are HIV positive.\\n\\nALTHOUGH TADGER HAS never been seen -- he is said to be extremely shy -- he can be counted on to answer a letter overnight. The campers rarely trouble Tadger with mentions of disease or doctors or hospitals. They tend to tell him that he shouldn't be so shy, or reassure him that they love him, or thank him for the little gifts he sometimes sends. During my stay at the camp, one boy wrote, \\"I have to tell you that your friend the white bear went out the wrong door, and he had to shake his bushy tail.\\" Hole in the Wall Gang campers aren't embarrassed about mentioning their illness, given the company. \\"All the kids there have learned to live through things,\\" one of the authors of \\"I Will Sing Life\\" wrote about the camp. \\"We know we're normal people.\\" Apparently, though, the younger children tend not to dwell on the subject -- not even in what's called Cabin Chat, a quiet time before bed, when the counselors and the campers talk by the light of a single candle.\\n\\nI sat in on Cabin Chat one night in a cabin of older boys. Everyone was asked to write down on a piece of paper something, important or trivial, that he would have changed if he'd had the power to change it -- the loaded assignment was from a robust-looking counselor who had himself had childhood cancer -- and then to toss the paper into a hat. The one piece of paper pulled out said, \\"Cancer was both the best thing and the worst thing that ever happened to me.\\" \\n\\nEveryone seemed to agree that the worst thing about having cancer was a drug called prednisone, a steroid that makes some people terribly angry and some people depressed and everybody enormously hungry. A lot of the campers found something good to say about having had cancer, although a certain amount of that had the sound of bravura or rationalization. There was talk about the interesting people they met; a couple of boys mentioned that cancer enabled them to come to the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. \\n\\nA boy who was still undergoing treatment seemed less certain about the good things, but finally he said, \\"I believe I'm tougher than any other kid in my school, at least mentally.\\"\\n\\nThat led to a discussion about who could make it through cancer treatment and who couldn't. There was considerable feeling that the school bullies, who thought they were so tough, could never make it through.\\n\\n\\"No, they'd make it,\\" the toughest boy in his school said. \\"What choice would they have? Die? We didn't have any choice.\\" Hugging Life"},{"year":"1928","title":"Production methods, illus MASS PRODUCTION BUILT ON METHOD","excerpt":"WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?"},{"year":"1994","title":"BUYING an insurance policy with the lowest face value and the highest premium strikes people as foolish.\\n\\nBut James H.

You can be sure tattoos have become fashionable when art galleries get into the act, which they have, with shows of tattoo designs. The latest and most ambitious, \\"Pierced Hearts and True Love: A Century of Drawings for Tattoos,\\" opens tomorrow at the Drawing Center, which is always stretching the outer reaches of what constitutes a drawing.

Why tattoos now? It's easier to understand why the art world has cottoned to the subject than why young people get them in the first place. Tattoos relate to many trendy art topics. Cartooning, for one. Body art, for another, which means not just art about the body, of which there has been so much (too much) lately, but also art involving the body: the sort of stuff artists like Vito Acconci and Chris Burden did in the 1960's and 70's has become important again to many young artists.

I was pleased at that time to hear a chorus of state legislative candidates ratify both the problem and the solution. Now I have given the Legislature a proposal to reduce spending this year by $1 billion through recurring cuts in local aid, social services and the state's work force. This plan will close the budget gap and without gimmicks.   It does not do it without pain. I have worked hard, however, to see that the pain is shared in proportion to the ability to make sacrifices. Cuts in education aid, for example, reflect a school district's wealth. I have minimized the need for employee layoffs through furloughs, attrition and voluntary retirement. This means, regrettably, that a rejection of my proposal for furloughs would force thousands of people out of work.   The deficit equals only about 2 percent of the state budget. Many states around the country and, of course, the Federal Government face greater imbalances.   Even with the cuts I have proposed, budget growth in such areas as education and mental health during my first two terms as Governor will have exceeded 90 percent, or three times the rate of inflation. It will be difficult to argue, in light of that growth, that any of the proposed cuts is intolerably deep or that they will leave local governments with no choice but to raise their taxes.   Our deficit-reduction plan is designed not to weaken our government, but to insure that we preserve government's capacity to meet its obligations over the long term.    Indeed, this period of revenue shortfalls presents an opportunity for re-examination and reform that can make our government more efficient than ever. I look forward to the analysis and recommendations of the Legislature and timely enactment of a plan that will balance this year's budget and prevent future deficits.   I ask for your help, especially in pointing out that it is not enough to reject the reductions","excerpt":"whatever is rejected must be replaced with an alternative cut.
