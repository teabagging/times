When the world's 17 largest central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, intervened last month to try to prop up the dollar, they dug deep into their pockets and came up with about $5 billion and change, which they threw into the market in an effort to bid up the value of the American currency. No wonder they had little effect on the dollar. The central banks were like a zoo keeper trying to calm a starved gorilla by offering it a raisin for lunch.   It really wasn't the fault of the governments, though. Raisins, it seems, are all they have sometimes, compared with the assets of the huge capital, currency and bond markets they are trying to influence. Whose world is this anyway? The answer is that it is increasingly Adam Smith's world -- a world in which the balance of power between global financial markets and governments is tilting toward markets.

These prognosticators may well be right, but not necessarily because motion picture exhibition is about to be rendered obsolete by the introduction of increasingly inexpensive home video equipment, wall-sized television screens and the availability of first-run films on cassettes or disks. When movie theaters finally disappear, technology will be only one of the reasons, and maybe not even the principal one.   The fact is that going to the movies these days is going to the dogs, a conclusion based on the accumulated experiences of random, unscientific theater-visiting over the last couple of years.   In comparison with the legitimate theater, the price of a movie admission hasn't gone up alarmingly but, in terms of value given, the cost of a movie ticket is seldom any bargain. More to the point, moviegoing is frequently inconvenient, unpleasant, unfriendly and depressing. On occasion it also can be as scary as anything that happens on the screen to the pretty, wide-eyed high school cheerleader who insists on going out alone on the night of Friday the 13th - a couple of Broadway houses have blind staircases that appear to have been designed for the pleasure and convenience of muggers.

The last eight years saw a historic resurgence of New York's economy. Real personal income rebounded from no growth to average annual increases of more than 3 percent. Per capita income in the state zoomed to 20 percent above the national average in 1989, up from 12 percent above in 1983.

Mr. Hawkins is probably known best in the United States for writing the classic song \\"I Put a Spell on You.\\" Although his 1956 Okeh recording was banned by most radio stations at the time, it became an underground hit and was later recorded by artists as diverse as Nina Simone and Them. Meanwhile, Mr. Hawkins was doing outrageous things onstage, too -- rising up out of coffins, wrapped in long capes and wearing bones in his nose, dragging around a walking stick topped with a skull named Henry that smoked cigarettes. Mr. Hawkins was a minor legend, one of rock-and-roll's original and genuine wild men.  A Down Time     Throughout the 60's and 70's, though, he had trouble finding record labels that would release his material, and he moved around between Hawaii, Philadelphia and New York.

It was what editors did in the rough-and-tumble of journalism when The New-York Times was striving to secure a foothold: when they went out of their way to ''make'' news, the papers became participants in what they were reporting.

In 1955, the Bums finally avenged five defeats at the hands of their rivals from the Bronx. Stewart Wolpin's BUMS NO MORE! The Championship Season of the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers (Harkavy/St. Martin's, $25) is an affectionate salute to that season of redemption. Pitch-by-pitch accounts of the seven games and dramatic photographs of key plays are the next best thing to a box seat in Ebbets Field or Yankee Stadium. As Mr. Wolpin, a former sportswriter at The Newark Star-Ledger, recounts, the Yankee dominance was such that even oddsmakers in Brooklyn bet against the Dodgers. When the Yankees won the first two games, it looked as if the bookies were right. But the Dodgers won the next three, and after another Yankees victory, ended a 55-year championship drought behind the fielding of Sandy Amoros and the pitching of Johnny Podres. Some of baseball's brightest legends feature in Mr. Wolpin's account, from Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider to Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra and Whitey Ford.

Dating from the early years of this century, it combines a wispy, Whistlerian estheticism with a modernist bent for machinery, overall pattern and abstraction. Needless to say, Dubreuil's pictures have long remained outside conventional photography histories.   But obscurity is often a virtue in today's revisionist art-historical climate, as well as in the avid collecting marketplace. Dubreuil's photographs, some 50 of which are on view for the first time at a commercial gallery, Barry Friedman Ltd., are especially appealing because they confound our received ideas about the transition in photography from Pictorialist to fully modernist styles.

This photoplay takes one back to the days when heroines were haughty and villians were knights","excerpt":"when plots were hatched in picturesque wayside inns; when usury thrived and the hawk-eyed game keepers were kept on the alert by poachers; when men fought with bare fists and old sea captains bragged of their capacity for port wine and were proud of a hook for a hand.Although this picture is not alive with suspense, it has its captivating moments, due to the frank and simple manner in which it has been produced and Richard Barthelmess's sympathetic portrayal of Barnabas Barty, the handsome son of an ex-pugilist and innkeeper, who, on inheriting a huge fortune, aspires to be a gentleman. After a discussion with his robust father, he is quite content that the best he can expect is to be an amateur gentleman. Sidney Olcott, producer of the film conception of \\"Little Old New York,\\" directed this subject, and it is obvious that this production might have been a better piece of work had some unnecessary details been skipped and more attention paid to the incidents through which Barty gains his polish.It is one of those pictures that has no little mirth in junctures intended to be anything but comical. For instance, Lady Cleone Meredith is thrown from her horse, and while she is still unconscious Barty and the persistent Sir Mortimer Carnaby hold a heated discussion which ends in a fight, in which Barty comes off the victor. The hero then turns his attention to Lady Cleone, who is slowly recovering from her fall. In a little shooting episode three men topple over simultaneously and are therefore seen in different postures of suffering. This scene, instead of giving the audience a shock, caused many persons to giggle and laugh.In the early chapters Barty's main efforts to become a gentleman appear to be confined to learning from a book how to bow. Later he enlists the assistance of a poacher, who had been a valet to various noblemen, and this renegade menial not only teaches Barty how to act but what to wear. It was all in the days of George III, when the essential article of sartorial equipment was an embroidered waistcoat.\\"Why is your eye in mourning?\\" the villain is asked by a friend, and it is later discovered that the redoubtable Barty is responsible for the villain's disfigured countenance. Barty can really ride a horse, and he triumphs in a steeplechase, much to Sir Mortimer's annoyance.The scenery, although the picture was made in Hollywood, is quite effective, and the sets of the old houses and streets do their share to help the entertainment. Mr. Olcott has also introduced a charming sequence in which the background is a garden party. In this episode an indulgent and loquacious duchess furnishes some amusement.Dorothy Dunbar gives a creditable performance as Lady Cleone. Gardner James is effective as Ronald Barrymaine, and Nigel Barrie is capable as Sir Mortimer.

Her parents, doctors and nurses are waiting for nature to take its course, but so far nature has not been kind.  Meanwhile, they look for a place in which she can live in warmth and peace.  When she sickens, as is inevitable, no extraordinary means will be used to save her","excerpt":"when she dies, her friends will know as much relief as grief.  But for the few months that are her life she will have been treated with courtesy, acknowledged as a human being.  Another baby was born two weeks ago in Indiana.  He had a incomplete esophagus, which is operable, and Down's syndrome, the consequences of which are impossible to estimate at birth.  Nature took its course very quickly - he died in six days - but with considerable help.  At his parents' request, the infant wasn't fed.  The decision, the family lawyer said, was \\"a private matter.\\" Why private?  Had that baby been normal, his death by starvation would have been a public concern.  But becausehe had been inadvertently robbed of perfection, he was deliberately robbed of life.  His flaws somehow canceled out his rights.  Two county courts and the Indiana State Supreme Court appear to have agreed: they declined to force his parents to feed \\"Infant Doe.\\" But if children have a chance to live, shouldn't they get it, whether or not their parents are willing?  And if they haven't a chance, like that little girl in a New York hospital, shouldn't they be allowed to leave this world in their own good time?

Members of Local 802, the musicians' union, have been handing out pink fliers entitled, \\"Grand Hotel: The Ripoff.\\" They are angry about the producers' decision last week to lay off the show's entire string section, a total of eight musicians, and replace them with a synthesizer. The move is saving the Tommy Tune show a much-needed $10,000 a week in expenses. But the musicians call the decision a \\"ripoff.\\" John Glasel, the president of Local 802, says: \\"What they're doing is consumer fraud. They have debased a show that won Tony Awards and are charging $60 a ticket for it. The public has a right to know that they're getting an el cheapo product.\\"   Some pretty serious charges, to be sure, and they are not being taken lightly, either by the show's producers or by the League of American Theaters and Producers, the organization of Broadway producers. They say that they've played by the rules and that the musicians are sore losers.   The house minimum for the Beck -- the minimum number of musicians the union will allow -- is 16, and the layoffs reduced the orchestra to 16 from 24, so the contract has not been violated. But the musicians cite their union's bylaws, which state musicians can't be replaced with a synthesizer. They took the producers to a union arbitration and lost because the orchestra has not been cut below the minimum. Undeterred, the musicians started the leaflet campaign. Mr. Glasel says: \\"The producers could find other ways to save money. They could ask for waivers of royalties from the creators.\\" Does he know for a fact that they haven't? Well, no, but he says, \\"I assume it hasn't been done.\\"   Marvin Krauss, the general manager and a co-producer of \\"Grand Hotel,\\" says its creators are all in a royalty pool that automatically rations the profits according to the weekly gross, insuring that no one's profits can hurt the show's health. More to the point, he says, is that \\"the musicians' union is trying to abrogate the contract because they didn't like the outcome of the arbitration.\\"   Mr. Glasel sent a letter about the leaflets to all Broadway musicians last week, in which he says, \\"Patrons are generally sympathetic and some have asked for their money back.\\" Absolutely false, says Mr. Krauss. \\"No one has asked for their money back,\\" he says. \\"Not a single peso.\\"   O.K. Disputes between producers and unions are nothing new. But what about the larger question, of whether live musicians might ever be an endangered species on Broadway? Probably not, say producers who maintain that the only reason this issue has got so much attention is a matter of money","excerpt":"when synthesizers are used in place of live musicians at other shows, union members must still be put on the payroll, because the producer must honor that house miminum.   Maury Yeston, a co-composer of \\"Grand Hotel\\" who is also a Yale musicologist, says: \\"While I'm enormously sympathetic to the musicians who are not working, the fact is that the use of the synthesizer is part of the growing pains in the continuing evolution of music. The quality of sampling, the process of electronically duplicating the live sound, is so good now that it's hard to tell which you're hearing. Of course, in a show like 'Fiddler on the Roof,' it would be a perversion to reproduce the solo violin which is the color of the whole show. But the road company of 'Grand Hotel' has been using the synthesizer instead of the strings and we haven't heard any complaints.\\"  'Mad Forest'     Caryl Churchill fans, take note: New York Theater Workshop will present the American premiere of her play \\"Mad Forest\\" at the Perry Street Theater from Nov. 22 through Dec. 29. Miss Churchill wrote the piece in 1989 after accompanying students from the Central School of Drama in Britain to Bucharest, Romania, where they all stayed with drama students and their families to \\"develop the piece,\\" says the theater's artistic director, James C. Nicola. He says that the play begins before the 1989 revolution and follows one family through it and its aftermath, \\"the kind of poisonous atmosphere of finger-pointing internalized by people and not so easily overthrown as a government.\\" \\"Mad Forest\\" was produced last fall at the Royal Court Theater in London, where it was directed by Mark Wing-Davey, who will also direct it here with an American cast. Information: (212) 302-NYTW. The Bar of the Show    The Broadway opening that's generating the most excitement in the theater this week isn't a play. It's a bar. Look for the Edwin Forrest Bar to open next door to the Eugene O'Neill Theater where the new Cameron Mackintosh revue, \\"Five Guys Named Moe,\\" is to open on April 8. Because the show calls for action in the bar area during intermission, Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns the O'Neill, has arranged to lease the space next door in the Hotel Consulate that was most recently occupied by the restaurant Columbus on Broadway. Paul Libin, the producing director of Jujamcyn, says that both the O'Neill and the Consulate were originally named the Edwin Forrest and joined by two entrances at the theater's rear. He says that they will be reopened, and that after each show, the Forrest, as the bar will be known, will be open to the public. If business is good, Mr. Libin says, they might serve lunch and supper, too. From Walls to the Boards    A rap writer and graffiti painter named Seth Zvi Rosenfeld? It's true, and he grew up to be a playwright. The 29-year-old writer's new play, \\"Servy-N-Bernice 4Ever,\\" starts performances at the Provincetown Playhouse on Oct. 5 under the direction of Terry Kinney, a co-founder of the Steppenwolf Theater Company. D. B. Sweeney co-stars with Lisa Gay Hamilton, Cynthia Nixon and Eric King in what is described as an interracial love story with a twist.   Mr. Rosenfeld has written a screen adaptation of his first play, \\"The Writing on the Wall,\\" which was developed at Ensemble Studio Theater, for New Line Cinema. Joey Vasquez (\\"Hangin' With the Homeboys\\") will direct.   Another new play with a race-related theme is \\"Distant Fires,\\" by Kevin Heelan, which will begin previews on Oct. 11 at the Atlantic Theater Company, directed by Clark Gregg. The play is about two laborers, one black, one white, who are competing for the same union post.

By G. E. Kidder Smith. 168 pp. (Abrams, $35.) It is difficult to imagine a more engaging introduction to the art of building than this collection of black-and-white photographs by the indefatigable G. E. Kidder Smith, who for more than 50 years has been recording architecture around the world for books that are now standard reference works. Trained as an architect, Mr. Smith has a sure grasp of what a building is essentially about, and he conveys the three-dimensional presence of a structure with remarkable power in his two-dimensional medium.   The photographer's selection of his own best pictures, sympathetically set off by Bob McKee's elegant book design, includes 80 landmarks renowned (the Parthenon, Taj Mahal and Eiffel Tower) as well as unfamiliar (the abbey of Pomposa in Italy, the country church of Havero church in central Sweden and the village of Baniane, Algeria). His striking images and pithy accompanying texts are personal, generous and illuminating. This is a man in love with architecture, and he transmits the pleasures of his life-long affair so joyously that few readers are likely to come away untouched by the broad expanse of his vision.   THE WORLD OF CHARTRES. By Jean Favier. 191 pp. (Abrams, $60.) No book can hope to capture the physical immediacy of the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Chartres, but this is a noble reminder of one of the consummate glories of Western architecture. Mostly built between 1194 and its dedication in 1260, to the designs of nine master masons, the present edifice replaced an earlier church destroyed by fire and believed to have been erected on the site of a pagan temple. Few who visit this overwhelming monument doubt that it is a sacred place, even though it possesses an insistently irrational quality at odds with the common perception of Gothic architecture as lucid and uplifting.    Chartres appeals to impulses embedded so deep in human memory that the spell this building casts quite defies explication through an inventory of its component parts. The narrative meanings of the biblical themes depicted in the cathedral's sublime stone sculpture and incomparable stained glass windows are more readily comprehended than the mysterious interactions of light and space within this stupendous, disturbing structure. For the immovable art of architecture, a book performs well if it makes one want to go to a building for a firsthand look, and at that this volume succeeds beautifully.   THE VILLA: Form and Ideology of Country Houses. By James S. Ackerman. 304 pp. (Bollingen Series XXXV, No. 34. Princeton University, $45.) Among the several histories of the country house published in 1990, this is easily the best. James S. Ackerman, the Arthur Kingsley Porter Professor of Fine Arts at Harvard University, is the acknowledged expert on Andrea Palladio, the late Renaissance architect and theorist whose classical villas in the Veneto region of Italy remained the international country house ideal for centuries, especially in the United States. Mr. Ackerman rightly places Palladio as the pivotal figure in his thoughtful, thought-provoking study of the villa from ancient Rome to the early 20th-century houses of Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier.   This is not an exhaustive chronological survey, but a series of focused chapters -- they were the A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts given at the National Gallery of Art in 1985 -- on the villa and its patrons at important junctures, among them the Medici in Tuscany, the Earl of Burlington and his circle in Georgian England, and Thomas Jefferson at Monticello. In each of them the author strikes a judicious balance between formal analysis and social interpretation.   Mr. Ackerman is quick to point out that the villa is not synonymous with the country house, the former term being reserved for buildings conceived for the pure enjoyment of the countryside, not primary residences weighted down with practical requirements. But that definition, correct though it may be, gets somewhat stretched by the time we reach Jefferson's exceedingly functional farmhouse, to say nothing of Wright's suburban Coonley house in Riverside, Ill.   Perhaps the certainty with which the Renaissance scholar can assess an Arcadian past accounts for the gloomy way Mr. Ackerman views the present. Though he stops far short of contemporary villas because \\"no historian can see his own time clearly,\\" he laments that \\"the traditional ideology that imputed spiritual and moral values to country life has finally been lost.\\" That may be so, but for millions of city dwellers around the world, their villas, however modest -- from log cabins on the lakes of Minnesota to wooden dachas in the Lenin Hills of Moscow -- remain the safety valves that make modern urban life tolerable during the working week, between rural escapes.   LIFE IN THE GEORGIAN CITY. By Dan Cruickshank and Neil Burton. 288 pp. (Viking, $35.) Few epochs in the history of design have been more wrongly romanticized than the 18th century. But this account of what daily life was actually like for Londoners during that imagined golden age will make interesting reading for people worried about the declining quality of life in big cities now. These were the good old days, the authors recall for us, when streets were unsafe and dirty and traffic was impossibly congested","excerpt":"when the air was polluted, real-estate developers were greedy, and contractors were apt to cut corners.   Mr. Cruickshank and Mr. Burton are particularly good at detailing the middle- and upper-class social conventions that both shaped and responded to the rapid expansion of the capital city during Britain's ascent as the world's leading economic and colonial power. They also provide information on everything from bricklaying techniques and paint colors to water closets and garbage removal, making intelligent use of period illustrations as a source of documentation often overlooked by historians who favor verbal records. If not up to the sheer brilliance of Sir John Summerson's 1945 classic \\"Georgian London,\\" this book helps explode the myth of 18th-century perfection, while offering convincing reasons why the general level of urban design was so much better then than it is today.   THE UNROMANTIC CASTLE: And Other Essays. By John Summerson. 288 pp. (Thames and Hudson, $35.) At the age of 86, Sir John Summerson is the greatest living architectural historian, and the publication of any new book of his is always a welcome event. This compendium of articles and lectures takes its title from Riber Castle, a mid-Victorian pile in Derbyshire that housed the author's old school and first aroused his awareness of the difference between good and bad architecture. His latest anthology is another virtuoso demonstration of the gifts that make him such a delight to read: a graceful style, an unflagging curiosity, an accomplished but never pedantic command of facts and an ability to put forth ideas with the assured ease of an enthusiast eager to share his thoughts with like-minded friends.   But Sir John's Apollonian temperament has not led him to the admiration of classical architecture alone, though of course he excels at that. In addition to his definitive essay on the 18th-century English country house, this book also contains several pathbreaking studies on Victorian architecture, including the once-despised semidetached suburban villas of London. He is also attracted to some of the more offbeat practitioners of classicism, including the bizarre neoclassical maverick Sir John Soane (of whose eccentric house-museum in London Sir John Summerson was curator for almost 40 years) and the early 20th-century mannerist Sir Edwin Lutyens, whose unexecuted scheme for the Roman Catholic cathedral of Liverpool, the author persuasively argues, would have been among the most awe-inspiring churches in Christendom.   Sir John, who is more than an antiquarian, concludes with an eloquent case for the history of modern architecture: \\"The main thing is to get that history right and to get it clear.\\" Those are tenets this scrupulous, peerless scholar has always personified.   CLAUDE-NICOLAS LEDOUX: Architecture and Social Reform at the End of the Ancien Regime. By Anthony Vidler. 447 pp. (MIT, $50.) The French Enlightenment architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux has become a patron saint of the post-modernists, who see in his pared-down but intensified version of classicism proof that ancient tradition can be recast in contemporary terms. Would that they possessed just a bit of his terrifying talent. Anthony Vidler, a professor of architecture at Princeton University, demonstrates with learned but lively authority that long before the Bastille fell, Ledoux's designs attained their visionary impact not just through daring manipulations of mass and detail, but because of the architect's uncanny knack for encapsulating timely theoretical issues in structural form.   Ledoux's incisively geometric customhouses surrounding Paris were architectural harbingers of the sweeping political changes about to occur, revolutionary sentinels in stone. His biggest chance to build -- the ideal city of Chaux, a royal saltworks erected on a radical plan near Besancon during the first decade of Louis XVI's reign -- was a metaphor for the orderly universe. Ironically, the new social system Ledoux helped presage condemned him as an accomplice of the monarchy, and thereafter most of his quirky variations on classical grandeur were fated to remain mere dreams of glory.   ELIEL SAARINEN: Projects 1896-1923. By Marika Hausen, Kirmo Mikkola, Anna-Lisa Amberg and Tytti Valto. 355 pp. (MIT, $125.) When he immigrated to the United States in 1923 after winning second prize in the Chicago Tribune Building competition, the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen began the distinguished second half of his fertile career. He went on to design the richly ornamented Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and a number of fine but much simpler church buildings. Yet by the end of his life he was eclipsed by the greater fame of his son, Eero, one of the leading lights of American architecture in the 1950's.   The earlier portion of the elder Saarinen's output, on which his reputation ought rightfully to rest, is not as celebrated as it should be. This extensive catalogue of his designs up to the age of 50 covers his best-known works in Finland -- his own country house, Hvittrask, and the Helsinki Railway Station -- as well as scores of proposals for everything from furniture to civic planning. In all of them, the architect struggled to devise an authentic national style for his homeland, then a grand duchy under Russian rule, in resistance against Czar Nicholas II's Russification campaign of 1899. The prodigious vigor of what might be termed Saarinen's Viking Art Nouveau phase -- compact, boldly emblazoned structures fairly bursting with folkloric energy -- makes this book one of the unexpected treasures of the season.   A SYSTEM OF ARCHITECTURAL ORNAMENT. By Louis H. Sullivan. 159 pp. (Rizzoli, $200.) Louis Sullivan was the Walt Whitman of American architecture, a sprawling genius of startling originality and unrestrained vitality whose spirit embraced multitudes. But for all his poetic inclination, Sullivan pursued his art in the hardheaded world of Chicago big business at the end of the 19th century, when he established himself as the master builder of the skyscraper.   After 1900, Sullivan's career soured, and with only a sporadic series of small bank commissions in small Midwestern towns to sustain him through two decades, he barely subsisted on the brink of destitution. In 1922, two years before his death, the Art Institute of Chicago's Burnham Library of Architecture paid Sullivan to set down, in words and drawings, his philosophy of organic design. The architect's response to his task was profound. He brought forth a manuscript of breathtaking beauty and heartfelt emotion, an exaltation of the life force in architecture as much as in himself.    Never has there been a more inventive ornamentalist. Sullivan's lush tangles of botanical forms and abstract patterns, reproduced in facsimile in this imposing folio with their delicate details intact, are wonders of complexity and coherence. First published by the American Institute of Architects in 1924, they offer timeless lessons in the dialogue between the whole of a design and its constituent parts. Above all, these mandala-like motifs are a testament to creative survival. Amid all this dazzling draftsmanship is the simple diagram of a sprout under which Sullivan inscribed his credo of regeneration: \\"Remember the Seed-Germ.\\"   THE LIVING HOUSE: An Anthropology of Architecture in South-East Asia. By Roxana Waterson. 263 pp. (Oxford University, $49.95.) Architectural traditionalists have made much in recent years of the need for a return to evocative signs and symbols in building. That imperative is deemed most urgent for houses, in which elements such as the pitched roof, central front door and prominent chimney are believed to confer the sense of psychic protection fundamental to domestic shelter. Nevertheless, the problem remains that architecture alone cannot make people feel at home in the universe. If social and religious institutions do not give those comforts, there is little that a house can do to compensate for a lack of larger spiritual connection.    That is one pertinent conclusion to be drawn from Roxana Waterson's engrossing study of traditional architecture among some 70 tribal ethnic groups in Southeast Asia. Ms. Waterson, an anthropologist at the National University of Singapore, elucidates the concept of    semangat    (\\"life force\\" in Malay and many Indonesian languages) as an integral part of animist beliefs that imbue buildings with a living presence acknowledged by makers and inhabitants alike and manifest in every step of the construction process.   From the selection of a site (during which the permission of the land must be sought) and the propitiation of the indigenous deities (Thai architecture incorporates a miniature spirit house to accommodate gods displaced by building) to the raising of the center post (the all-powerful navel of a house) and the roofing of a structure (often a communal effort accompanied by complex rituals), the author presents a memorable chronicle of some of the richest architectural cultures on earth. This is an instructive example of how \\"primitive\\" ways of building can help us understand why most of our architecture no longer performs numinous functions for us.

Solving that minor mystery is essential to understanding the defects of Claude Chabrol's \\"The Nada Gang,\\" a muddled yet sometimes rewarding movie, which opened yesterday at the Playboy Theater.In Paris, a group of youthful terrorists kidnap the United States Ambassador to France, and the French Government responds with a scenario of overkill. The movie condemns the state even more fiercely than it does the outlaws","excerpt":"when the authorities consider sacrificing the hostage's life so that the public will lose its sympathy for the Left, the film thoroughly fulfills Mr. Chabrol's own conviction that \\"the state prefers terrorism to revolution.\\"There are many fine scenes throughout the movie—each enhanced by impeccable camerawork—as when the stolid Ambassador is seized at a posh brothel while watching a barely veiled prostitute ape Salome, or when a getaway car overturns in a field of rippling wheat. And there are several good performances—notably, Maurice Garrel as an aging professional revolutionary, a rueful cynic who alternates between being vulnerable or ruthless, wistful or hardheaded.But the trouble with the movie—and here comes that hat again—is that the pivotal character, the anarchist, is a joke figure. Played by Fabio Testi, he's all burning glances, flaring nostrils, and operatic gestures. Whereas the murderous police officer (Michel Aumont) is thoroughly believable, the Nada gang is mainly ludicrous. To portray them, the director grasps at clichés: those on the Left simply have to oversleep, guzzle booze in the morning and keep untidy homes.Although Mr. Chabrol deplores the group's tactics, he has some sympathy for its intentions. Yet he makes its members into political idiots; for example, the ransom demanded for the Ambassador serves no revolutionary purpose, it's just for \\"the cause.\\" Also, because the script is sloppy, the film seems to equate dissidence with terrorism.Meanwhile, Mariangela Melato plays a creature who's almost obligatory in a movie of this kind: a rebellious swinger who has joined the revolution for sex, not politics, and who dramatizes her own self-hate by boasting that she's a whore. The actress, who doesn't equal her performances in Lina Wertmuller's films, does salvage moments of this hackneyed role with the ironic, level-eyed gaze that she used in \\"The Seduction of Mimi.\\"Mr. Chabrol has chosen a milieu that's just too alien for him, as the absurdity of the film's conclusion proves. While most of his terrorists are middle class, they're too far removed from the bourgeoisie that he understands so well. Still, he has achieved an elegant blast at corrupt authority, even though he has muffed the characterization of its enemies or critics.

Without prodding from the Federal Government, 12 Eastern states and the District of Columbia moved last week toward subjecting themselves to the strictest rules on car emissions available, those written by the state of California. In Los Angeles, the week before, the largest gasoline marketer in the country, Arco, said it had independently developed a new fuel that was cleaner than the Federal Government requires and was even cleaner than methanol. Arco, hoping to get an edge on the market, wants California to order its use.     Less than a year after passage of the Clean Air Act of 1990, it might seem odd to find state governments and private companies lining up to be regulated yet more closely. Throughout most of the first two assaults on smog and other pollutants, the Clean Air Acts of 1970 and 1977, the states cowered at the thought of more regulation and reacted mostly when threatened with loss of Federal road funds and other sanctions.

Andrée Lafavette plays a Trilby full of fun, an agile little French girl who has the ability to enjoy anything so long as Little Billee, the Laird and Taffy are present. She manifests her loathing for Svengali and her sympathy for the adoring Gecko.When posing in the \\"altogether\\"—which is discretely pictured so as not to offend censors—she is so sweetly sorry that it shocks the devoted Little Billee.But whimsical and charming as Mille. Lafayette is, it is Arthur Edmund Carewe's revelation of Svengali that dominates this production. His makeup is true as steel. He has the long fingers, the sharp, aquiline nose, the hollow, cadaverous cheeks, the black, matted beard and unkempt hair of the Svengali of the book. His dark eyes are scintillating and gruesome. He is the sleek, sloppy, greasy Svengali. He wears shapeless trousers, a filthy shirt and an Inverness cape. In the latter portion of the film he is garbed in a narrow-shouldered dress suit and straight trousers, in which costume he gasps his last in an uncomfortable position.His beguiling of Trilby is gripping and tense, and his perpetual eavesdropping on the Three Musketeers of the Brush begets hatred. He is never one of the party, but is constantly cropping up, and when Little Billee's parents are aghast at the idea of their son marrying Trilby. Svengali smiles fiendishly and resorts to the power of his hypnotic cunning to lure the girl away, to bring song where it does not exist.There is an excellent scene in the theatre at which Trilby makes her appearance as La Svengali, the posters of which attract Little Billee, the Laird and Taffy on their return to Paris. Trilby fascinates her audience as Svengali wields the baton. Then after the intermission, when she has recovered from the spell of the dark one's influence, she bawls forth \\"Ben Bolt\\" in a flat and disturbing manner.Trilby is seen ill in her room, appealed to by Little Billee. A picture is brought to her when he has left. She unwraps it and before her sees the Saturnine Svengali. The picture comes to life and then fades down to the mere photograph, with Trilby attacked by its spell and dying.Some of the scenes in this production were made in Paris. Creighton Hale's performance as Little Billee is not at all sympathetic, and Philo McCullogh, as Taffy, seems occasionally conscious that his whiskers do not belong to him.In these days, when so much plot and counterplot is demanded by producers, Trilby is not an easy work to screen. The actual costumes are not picturesque any more than the bewhiskered and bearded countenances of the men. Nevertheless this photoplay is wonderfully good and great credit is due Mr. Tully for meticulous attention to detail. He is a man who is eager to give the public sensible and wholesome pictures.

In addition to the Dietrich, Ms. Ayers (above, with Jeff Gumer, left, and John Bolton) taps her inner country gal, Sophia Loren, a Mexican temptress and a diner bimbo, with musical numbers to match. ''My acting teachers would be thrilled,'' she said. ''It's five shows in one.'' The show, written by Gregg Coffin, is the first Off Broadway effort by the Geva Theater Center in Rochester, and it made the transition with unusual speed: its premiere at Geva was just last year. (Mark Cuddy, Geva's artistic director, said the enthusiasm for the show among Rochester backers was immediate: ''It was the easiest million dollars I've ever raised.'') For Ms. Ayers, it's a chance to show off an arsenal of theatrical skills she has been honing since childhood, with lots of family support. She recalls a community theater production of ''Annie'' back in Columbia, Mo., in which she played an orphan; her sister, Becca, had the lead; her father was in the band; her mother did costumes; and the family dog, with a dye job, was Sandy.

In recent years she has become known for her abstract sculptures based on organic forms or archeological artifacts like jugs and horns. These objects are executed in rough materials whose highly textured surfaces echo the sense of the passage of time that her forms evoke.   In her new work Ms. Driscoll uses her awareness of the expressive possibilities of abstract shape and her sensitivity to materials to consider a specific historical event that resonates with political and psychological significance. Her installation at Philip Morris was suggested by the story of Harriet Jacobs, a former slave from North Carolina who published her autobiography in 1861. While attempting to escape, Jacobs was forced to live for seven years in the eaves of her grandmother's shed, near the home of her master. Throughout her confinement she had only a tiny hole in the wall through which to see the outside world. Out of this dramatic story Ms. Driscoll has constructed a smart, moving work that touches on a wide range of topical issues, including the relationship between the physical and the psychological, as well as that of vision and power.

If you want to be 100 percent persuasive, dramatically speaking, don't be more than 85 percent dramatic. A play needs some room to cool off.   What is fundamentally wrong with Joe Pintauro's ''Snow Orchid,'' now at the Circle Rep in Sheridan Square, is that it is approximately 115 percent dramatic, and no group of characters - not even a family of mixed Sicilian-American blood - can hope to survive that.

For one thing, it seems a healthy sign rather than regrettable that prison officials have difficulty finding experienced executioners these days. Few of us could bring ourselves to administer death personally to one of our fellow beings despite all supposed theoretical justifications for the death penalty. This seems true even though many Americans still endorse capital punishment.   That there can be some who favor painful methods of execution is a horrifying fact reflecting how much primitive attitudes, unworthy of any citizens of a supposedly civilized country, still remain.   The basic problem, though, lies not with the methods of execution (all of which are inhumane), but with the death penalty itself. It rests on the two pillars of retribution and deterrence. As for retribution, the death penalty reflects the primitive retaliatory law according to which punishment must mirror the crime. Judge or executioner, and society with them, descend to the criminal's level and become the criminal's equal.    As for deterrence, statistical experience in the United States and other countries (the majority of which do not have any death penalty) shows the death penalty to be ineffective.   I believe that the death penalty is bound to make murder and other capital crimes more likely. When the state kills, killing becomes thinkable for its citizens. The murderer, rather than being deterred, enters a situation of combat with society, which while risky, implies a certain condition of (perhaps even heroic) equality. Generally, the odds favor the murderer and are grossly in his favor after murdering the first time.   To limit lawless killing, it must be held as an extraordinary, totally despicable and incomparable deed by the community. Punishments such as mandatory life sentences, irreversible segregation from the community and ostracism might then acquire weight and serve as effective deterrents.

There is no denying, however, that this screen work has speed and a certain rhythm. It is the sort of diversion which leaps from romantic pickpockets to backstage bickering and then tumbles into a variety of numbers as they are set forth in a tuneful footlights show for the edification of a most enthusiastic screen audience composed of extras. And, as everybody knows by this time, there is no gathering which is quite as appreciative as the one Hollywood pays to applaud.Mr. Dunn plays Duke Stanley, a man who evidently has a heart. He is, moreover, an expert in the questionable art of picking pockets and he is supposed to render true service at the psychological moment to a musical extravaganza. Cliff Edwards appears as Louie Webb, who is not presumed to be overburdened with brains. Duke is a wit when it comes to barking for a carnival show, but he is a numbskull when in the presence of the flaxen-haired Toni Ray, who is portrayed by June Knight.Any idea of attempting to follow this story might easily result in one becoming as addle-brained as are some of the characters. It is best to take the songs such as \\"Eadie Was a Lady\\" or \\"Its Only a Paper Moon\\" without giving any thought to the progress of the narrative. Both these numbers, and also others, are neatly staged and adequately rendered, especially Miss Roth's singing of the late lamented Eadie, who rather reminds one of Service's \\"Lady Known as Lou.\\"Mr. Dunn undoubtedly reveals an aptitude for such musical affairs. He speaks his lines as though they sprang from his mind and he is constantly on the alert to add to the interest of his scenes. What more can one ask of him? Mr. Rogers dawdles through his rôle, except when he has the opportunity to give a rascal a blow which has about the same effect as one from Max Baer. Miss Knight is attractive and moderately effective. As for Mr. Edwards, he is sufficiently wide-eyed to arouse laughter at times, but his part, except for a sequence toward the end, is merely verbose.The picture is handsomely staged and there are several scenes with graceful and lithe dancing girls.On the Paramount Stage.The delicious drolleries of Jimmy Savo, a clown of the first magnitude, dominate the stage show at the Paramount Theatre this week.

A.Stars twinkle, or appear to twinkle, because of turbulence in the atmosphere, which is not perfectly transparent and can be considered, for this purpose, as a kind of flexible lens. The turbulence causes the constant irregular mixing of small regions of more dense and less dense air. As a result, the refractive properties of the air - its power to bend light one way or another - are constantly changing along the line of sight from us to a star. Since stars are so far away that they are point sources of light, rather than disks, these constant refractive changes cause the light we see from the star to change constantly, becoming stronger, weaker or even disappearing briefly. Planets do not ordinarily twinkle because they are disks, not points. The light from different parts of a planet's surface follows different paths to our eyes, and consequently the refractions tend to cancel out and the light is seen as more or less steady. When atmospheric turbulence is very strong, planets are occasionally seen to twinkle","excerpt":"when turbulence is very low, stars sometimes stop twinkling.

When the movie opens, Per Oscarsson, who plays the young writer, is eating paper and throwing delicately up (rather in the manner of Elvira Madigan), and thinking of drowning himself in a river in Oslo.The movie is shot mainly from two perspectives, that of its period, around 1890, and the perspective of the edible. Both are completely convincing, so that when the writer looks down at his shoes one thinks at once whether it would be practical to chew on them","excerpt":"when two plates of soup are brought into a room one imagines briefly, against all given information, that one of them is meant for him. He goes along, courtly, feverish with a sense of his own talent, becoming progressively more dotty, both from hunger and from a need to distract himself with pointless fictions, lies, hysteria. A woman, played by Gunnel Lindblom, teases him and leads him on until he is aroused—almost out of weakness and as a gentleman. Then she becomes frightened and decides that he is drunk or mad. On a park bench after a rain he says, \\"Send me a sign, Oh Lord\\" and looks down to find a particularly repellent looking earthworm.Yet the movie does not indulge itself or him. He is not saintly or really anybody's fault. The director, Hennig Carlsen, just seems to follow Oscarsson quite carefully about and let him act. And Oscarsson himself is extraordinary, ranging from a vertiginous, disgusting, almost verminous decay, with bad, stained teeth, to a completely incandescent, waif-poetic charm. Miss Lindblom too is fine, as the overripe and dallying, fairly obnoxious lady who is drawn to him. The supporting characters, pawn-brokers, beggars, tenants of boarding houses, editors of periodicals, are also excellent. It is a movie to see when you are in the mood for reading a short story that is almost entirely descriptive, hardly narrative, when you are in the mood for reading prose firmly grounded in a time and state of mind, prose by Rilke, say, or for all I know, by Hamsun.The film, which is in Swedish and which was shown two years ago at the New York Film Festival, opened yesterday at the Trans Lux East. In 1966, Per Oscarsson won a best-actor award at Cannes for his performance in the film.

Although a wood stove can be a safe and effective method for conserving fuel and lowering energy costs in areas where wood is readily available for the cutting or where it can be purchased at a reasonable price, many homeowners do not take the time to learn how to install and operate them safely. As a result, many fires have been caused by wood stoves, and authorities fear that the return of cold weather may once again lead to a rash of fires that can be directly attributed to the use of wood stoves that are not properly installed or operated.   One frequent cause of fire is the failure to follow the recommendations of local fire officials and building inspectors about the amount of clearance needed between the stove and the nearest flammable material of any kind. Unless the wall is covered with asbestos board or similar fire-resistant facing, there should be at least 36 inches of space between it and the stove, and the same amount of space between the front and sides of the stove and the nearest furniture or wall.

Critics were on to these from the very beginning, but in the forward-looking 1920's, they joined his readers to make him the writer for their time. His stuff was new. It moved.

Most are restless, heads bobbing like hundreds of tiny craft on a lake. As audiences go, this is shaping up to be a tough one. But to know how a movie is going to play, the studio must test it.

I discovered _Tropic of Cancer_ in the summer of 2005, when two years of bewildering social and intellectual impotence at the University of Pittsburgh had left me frustrated and misplaced. I had run from high school to college in the earnest pursuit of truth, but had not to stay long before worrying that maybe in spite of my hunger for knowledge, I was not the university type after all. Although I initially flew at college with the intensity of a laser beam, a quick “Freshman Studies” brainwashing on the value of a “liberal arts education” was all it took to scatter the force of my curiosity on impact. I had been anxious to jump right in and see what Philosophy was all about, but my advisers at Pitt, operating under a liberal arts theory, prescribed intellectually dilute yet logistically overwhelming schedules for underclassmen – a tight regimen of dabbling – that I think prevented me from ever really taking root in the Philosophy Department. I can’t say it was all bad; I did put some solid work into English, for example, which was a critical step in establishing my academic direction. But two years is a long time to feel like an outsider in one’s major department, and when those beaming study-abroad veterans regaled my foreign language class with tales of life-changing journeys of self-discovery overseas, I considered study abroad not only as a temporary escape from my frustrations, but as an opportunity to see how Philosophy worked at another university. So, passing over the glossy pamphlets advertising Pitt-affiliated abroad programs, I opted instead for a direct enrollment with University College London.

Ceilings seem to be the latest surface to come into play, here covered with maps or inscribed with thoughtful mottoes.   Old masters of decorating like David Hicks make rare cameo appearances. There are quirky sources of inspiration like Montacute House, an Elizabethan mansion in Somerset that is not exactly at the top of every young designer's list of stately homes to visit.   Despite the geographic diversity of the designers, the 30 rooms are not incompatible. Most of the designers from both sides of the Atlantic had a good time. And it shows.   \\"I didn't even realize that there had to be anything English about all this,\\" said Kitty Hawks, a Manhattan designer who transformed a fifth-floor attic room into her version of a private retreat.   \\"I love animals and natural things,\\" said Ms. Hawks, who covered the walls with a barklike material and chose accessories like a bird-patterned rug, a screen painted with roosters and chickens, and a William Wegman portrait of her dog, Earl.   By contrast, David Laws, a London decorator, anchored the British contingent with his elaborate dining room, which has striking wallpaper in a lily of the valley pattern. Six English reproduction Chippendale chairs and two 18th-century-style wing chairs surround the huge round table, set within an inch of its life.   Mr. Laws recalled going to lunch six years ago with Nancy Lancaster, the renowned British decorator. They sat across from each other in armchairs not unlike the ones he used.   \\"It was divine,\\" Mr. Laws recalled, \\"and not just another brown wood dining room. Here I wanted to re-create the kind of traditional ambiance where you get all involved in the talk and forget about the decoration.\\"   That simply would not happen in David Anthony Easton's expertly detailed gentleman's library. Overscale architectural sketches unfurl next to the cluttered desk, where a portrait of King Henry VIII and framed photographs of Queen Victoria, a Highlands shooting party and Mr. Easton and his dog, Lilly, supply suitably British connections. Carved wooden spires - 18th-century models for a Gothic church - sit atop a George III breakfront. Tapestry draperies, inspired by those in a 19th-century Scottish castle, give the room a cozy glow.   \\"David dreamed it all up, then we went shopping,\\" said John Christensen, an associate at Mr. Easton's New York firm.   A tweed-jacketed Charlotte Moss, who turned a paneled third-floor room into a English-style library and sitting room, said, \\"I don't have English roots, only Virginia roots, but then Virginia was settled by the English. Maybe it's just another sixth sense and a little bit of theater, what I call 'instant crust.' The idea was to create a usable room. Few people go into a library just to read. No one has the time anymore.\\" A playful note is the white matelasse sofa, with its colored buttons. \\"Like M&M's,\\" Ms. Moss said.   Beyond the baronial rooms, there are several small tours de force: the painted violins on the draperies in Jarrett Hedborg's music room; the subtle Robert Adam-inspired trompel'oeil painting in the entrance foyer by Raphael Serrano; Dennis Rolland's ambitious pink and white silk-bedecked reception room on the second-floor landing, and Michael Tyson Murphy's delicate 18th-century-style lady's dressing room.   But not one surpasses the fourth-floor bathroom by the Painted Decoration Studio as far as charm and probably livability are concerned.   \\"I wanted it to be eccentric,\\" said Frank Figueroa, the New York company's designer, who turned the old-fashioned bathroom into a travel writer's haven, complete with a vintage manual typewriter set on a custom-made over-the-tub table. It is almost certainly the only white-tiled study ever to grace a show house.   \\"He's writing about all these far-away places while he's sitting in the tub and looking at a map on the ceiling,\\" Mr. Figueroa said. No realistic touch was neglected: the dictionary had already fallen into the water.   Those who believe that Elizabethan England is a far cry from contemporary design will be surprised at Helen Cooper and Francesca Di Blasi's fresh-looking fourth-floor bedroom. \\"Our inspiration was Montacute House,\\" said Ms. Cooper, who interpreted elements of the grand Somerset house with photographs by Margitta Ysenburg, stylish wrought-iron sconces by Lucy Fielden, a copper and silk organza bed by Babette Holland, and a white-on-white medieval-style banner.   David Hicks sprinted back and forth between New York and London and his country estate in Oxfordshire to organize his third-floor sitting room, which is covered floor to ceiling with fabric from Quadrille.   \\"I can't bear all those fussy, overdecorated rooms,\\" he said. \\"I wanted it to be a luxurious bed-sitting room, but no froufrou and no pattern-on-pattern, as though I were living in New York for two days a month. That's about all I could manage. I never stay anywhere more than two days. I work very fast.\\"   These days Mr. Hicks, whose long decorating career is saluted with a retrospective of drawings on the walls of the adjoining room, is concentrating on garden design and landscaping, which he finds more rewarding. \\"People get divorced, or they die, or sell their homes, and the fabric comes off the walls,\\" he said. \\"If you've planted an avenue of trees, you don't cut them down.\\"   The London town house where the photographer and set designer Cecil Beaton lived in the 60's was the inspiration for Stephen Sills and his partner, James Huniford, who created an extravagantly stylish dining room. \\"The house was all Georgian with painted white paneling and black insets and Spanish lace edging,\\" Mr. Sills recalled. \\"We didn't have the Spanish lace so we had it stenciled\\" on wool.   The designers also included loads of real pomegranates, Jean-Michel Frank lamps, an oval mirror by Emilio Terry, a generously fringed midnight blue tablecloth and green upholstered Russian chairs. But the piece de resistance is the 17th-century gilt chandelier in the shape of bare-breasted angels. \\"Outrageous, isn't it?\\" Mr. Sills said. Absolutely.

In these reveries, described in language that distills a clinical view of the human body into an icy, detached poetry, Dennis imagines himself a serial killer who murders the men he has sex with.

No senseless romance mars this effort, in fact nary a woman crosses the screen. Its story deals with the bloody push on the Somme in 1916. It was directed by M. A. Wetherell, and Boyd Cable, the author, acted as literary adviser. It is actually a subject where it would be well high possible to exaggerate, but even so, the producers have adroitly steered clear of giving too much of one thing and there is no attempt to overdo the blood and bandages. Some of the scenes are actual pictures of the fighting.It gives a fine conception of the zero hour, with the officers looking at their wrist watches, all waiting for the second before anybody leaps over the top. It is not bitter in its narrative, but a few pages of history. It gives one the true impression of the frightfulness of war with only a few touches of comedy. There is the courage on both sides and while the Tommies are victors, there is no gloating. There is a wood, mowed by fire until the trees look like splintered telegraph poles. The handful of Britishers left in that stark spot were finally saved by welcome re-enforcements.Corporal T. W. H. Veale, who won the Victoria Cross in the Somme fighting, in this film shows what he did to win that award. He happens to see an arm lifted in No Man's Land. He leaps over the parapet and squirms and crawls to the rescue. He discovers that the wounded man is an officer, and with bullets whizzing past him, he succeeds in pulling the officer to a shell hole. He returns then and two other soldiers volunteer to help him bring in the wounded officer. Veale takes a Lewis gun with him and covers his mates while they are trying to lug the wounded man to the British line.There also are flashes purporting to show Piper James Richardson of the Canadian Scottish, who fused his comrades with further zeal by marching back and forth on the parapet playing his bagpipes.\\"Teh Somme\\" gives one the impression of having been pictured during the battles. There is a suggestion of Bairnsfather's famous \\"Better 'Ole\\" when two Tommies are in one of those shell holes. They are there waiting for a chance to join their pals. One of them pops up his head and then wants to know what ails him. His comrade laughs at him. They both look up, and in the distance they see something that through the mist looks like a prehistoric monster. Then, to their dismay, the thing becomes more distinct. It is their first sight of a tank! After that the crawling fortress pushes its way along, crushing dugouts, parapets and anything in its path.No picture of this 1916 series of battles would be complete without a good look at the mud. There are men in the trenches knee deep in water and mud. And scenes are shown of the Germans, alluded to by the Tommy as Jerry, with saturated coats and boots and trousers covered with the slime.Thiepval, Bapaume, Contalmaison, Combles and other spots all come in for a few scenes in this Big Show of '16, which is like leaning back and visualizing the fighting in those dark days.Certain of the sequences are actual war scenes exhibited with permission of the trustees of the Imperial War Museum.

If you did not get into Cornell or Brandeis or Brown University, you could always commute to N.Y.U. But the administration, doing some long-range planning, decided that being the safety school was not good enough. So in 1984, it began a brash campaign aimed at moving the school into the nation's top tier of universities. And according to academics around the country who have looked on with envy, the strategy worked. A1.

Nor are her fears exaggerated: there is abundant evidence that young women see themselves as the intellectual and professional equals of men until they get to college, where cultural influences and unsubtle sexism persuade some of them to accept less than equality.   In the last 25 years, all but two of the country's male single-sex colleges and universities have officially become coeducational. But not one of these scores of colleges has yet chosen a woman as its president. Ms. Quindlen and her daughter could stroll through the administrative building at my university, or hundreds more like it, and encounter only a handful of women in positions higher than secretary.   But take a stroll through the administrative building of a nearby women's college, like Bryn Mawr. Here women occupy virtually all positions of authority, starting with the presidency. At women's colleges, there is none of the overt or subtle sexism that taints higher education elsewhere. Let me assure Ms. Quindlen that a graduate of a women's college would know what to say, if her superior in the workplace put his hand on her knee, to make it impossible for him ever to try doing it again, for women who attend such schools do not consider themselves noodles in a sexist chicken soup.   It stands to reason that the country's most successful professional women are graduates of women's colleges. Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood, one-third of the women in Congress, half the women who belong to corporate boards attended women's colleges. Women are underrepresented in the sciences, in medicine, in the law -- but the graduates of women's colleges in these professions are not. When women leaders like Anna Quindlen discover the wide avenue to women's success at colleges like Bryn Mawr, Barnard, Wellesley and Mills, they can envisage a future for their daughters untainted by fear of discrimination.

It's the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor on the East End of Long Island -- a place where stage artists can escape the scrutiny of big, bad New York.         Other summer playhouses in idyllic settings also attract top acting talent (the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts, for example). But the nonprofit Bay Street, now entering its fifth season, operates throughout the year as a community arts organization, educational facility and all around refuge for the growing number of dramatists who call that part of Long Island home.

With minimal government subsidies for the arts, which now represent less than 10 percent of the festival's budget, and a discouraging 7 percent increase in ticket prices dictated by Canada's grumble-provoking Goods and Services Tax, the Stratford Festival, which runs a narrowing but continuing deficit, has got to get a very big audience. And the ecdysiast is right: to get that audience -- particularly after repeated productions of the Shakespearean standards that made the festival's name -- you gotta have that gimmick, or, indeed, many gimmicks.   It represents no small achievement that the festival can report that it will probably take in its largest box-office grosses ever this year.

He immediately wrote off all the outstanding tabs at John's  Restaurant and Bar, which he and his brother Rafael had owned together since the late 1930's, and thus became a legend along the docks of Red Hook, Brooklyn. In what was then a rough waterfront neighborhood, respect was the measure of a man, and John Balzano never took it for granted. \\"The fact that this place still exists after all these years, after all that has happened to Red Hook, is a testimony to the respect that my uncle John got from  the people,\\" said Antonio R. Balzano, 62, Rafael's son. \\"People remember this place because of him.\\" John's Restaurant and Bar, at the foot of Conover Street, has outlived by 15 years the last of the 30-odd other saloons that were once in the area. It is a virtual time capsule from the 1940's, a remnant of what was a bustling wartime port half a century ago. But it is also a symbol and the centerpiece of a revitalized Red Hook. John's nearly faded into history like the surrounding neighborhood when John Balzano died in 1994. He didn't leave a will -- and that, Antonio Balzano said,  left a \\"wall of obstacles\\" to keeping the place going. \\"I was ready to let it all go,\\" he said, dragging on his umpteenth Marlboro of the day. The liquor license held by John Balzano expired on Jan. 31, and with legal delays keeping the bar closed, Mr. Balzano decided to reopen it as a nonprofit organization, with the support of John Balzano's 15 other heirs. \\"I had a mailing list of people -- artists, everybody -- and when I wrote them this idea,\\" he said, \\"I got a tremendous response. More than 200 people replied.\\" For now, John's operates as the nonprofit Red Hook Canoe and Yacht Club -- but to add to the confusion, patrons call it Sonny's, after Antonio Balzano's nickname. Its status as a club, however, is hardly exclusive -- upon entering, nonmembers need only hook up with one of the regulars, most of them local artists who pay a $25 annual membership fee, and sign a guest book. There is a suggested donation of $3 per drink, and tabs are scribbled on paper casters. As Red Hook undergoes a slow renaissance sparked by artists seeking to escape the high rents of Manhattan, John's has become a focal point of this rebirth, and conversation now dwells on the Edward Hopper-like quality of sunlight in the neighborhood rather than shipping schedules. On Fridays evenings -- the only time the club currently operates -- people drift down to the end of Conover Street to admire the sunset over the harbor and pour  back into John's afterward. Around the original hand-carved oak bar, which stretches the length of the first of its three rooms, the club's yellowing walls are lined with prints of Holland-America line ships, models and paintings of boats and military memorabilia. In the 1940's, Red Hook was home to Navy drydocks and to hundreds of ships moored between Piers 41 and 49. Among other period pieces like a Blatz Beer boiled-egg dispenser, hand-painted plaster statues of the Marx brothers, Mark Twain, Humphrey Bogart and Louis Armstrong peer through the half-light toward three massive coffee urns that Antonio Balzano said served up to 3,500 cups of a coffee a day during the 1940's. \\"Nothing in here has been changed,\\" he said. \\"If you take three or four things out of the place, it won't be the same anymore.\\" The restaurant, with a view over the Buttermilk Channel toward the Statue of Liberty, was founded by Marc Antonio and Angelina Balzano, immigrants who arrived from Naples in 1890. Their daughter, Grace, born March 17, 1906, is the  oldest surviving member of the family. During the 1920's, the restaurant operated under a complicated partnership, and  a yellowed certificate issued by New York City's Licensing Department and dated  July 1924 certifies that John Balzano's brother-in-law, John Happe, was permitted to operate a pool table on the premises at $5 per annum. The several apartments above the restaurant are the exclusive domain of the Balzanos -- no one outside the family has ever lived there. Twenty-six thousand people lived in Red Hook by the mid-1950's, but the advent of container ships that were too large for the channel meant a loss of jobs for  longshoremen and other dock workers and brought the neighborhood to the brink of extinction. Today, Red Hook is home to no more than 3,500 people, said John McGettrick, a local historian and co-chairman of the Red Hook Civic Society. Antonio Balzano was among the thousands who left. He was an aspiring artist and  actor, but after four years in the Air Force in California, he ended up going to work for a jeweler in Manhattan's diamond district. Unsatisfied, he soon quit to paint full time in the early 1960's. His first break came when he was commissioned to paint murals at Le Boeuf a la Mode, a restaurant on East 81st Street, which led to an offer to work as an assistant to Larry Rivers and Willem de Kooning. \\"But I was brash,\\" he said. \\"I wanted to be a real artist.\\" He turned down an offer to teach at Southampton University and spent the rest of the 1960's on the party circuit. In 1970, emotionally spent, he decided to seek spirituality in India, where he spent most of the next decade. In 1980, after his father became ill with cancer, Mr. Balzano returned to Red Hook to help out in the bar, eventually taking over when Rafael died in 1987. But when John Balzano died without a will, ownership of the bar was not immediately clear. In the club's basement, Mr. Balzano's girlfriend, Tona Johansen, pointed out a huge pile of yellowing documents. \\"John kept everything, every piece of paper, but never kept it in any order,\\" she said. \\"It has made things difficult, complicated.\\" But with the help of Ms. Johansen and other friends, accounts have been sorted out, junk cleared and refrigerators rewired. Mr. Balzano has applied for a liquor license and, if it is approved, plans to rename the place Balzano's. The influx of artists and young people into the area has brought with it new energy, and on Friday nights aspiring musicians play to an appreciative crowd. The mix is eclectic: country rock alternates with Lou Reed-style rock poetry, and the later the hour, the darker the lyrics. Kim Faiella, a painter from Brooklyn Heights, is positively possessive about Sonny's, as she calls it. \\"This place is so special, it has not changed at all,\\" she said. \\"It has attracted its own artist community from all over Brooklyn. There is great energy here, and we are very excited about what is happening in Red Hook now.\\" Mr. Balzano said: \\"This place does not belong to me. It belongs to all the good  people here.\\" NEW YORKERS & CO.","excerpt":"Where to Hoist in Red Hook"},{"year":"1997","title":"Selection of on-line sites and books on issues of global warming and climate change (M).

Here, the river flows through bosky canyons where peregrine falcons may hunt for wood pigeons overhead, while below delicious Wye salmon flaunt their silvery flanks at patient fishermen. In the 18th century, adventurous parties would set out from Ross-on-Wye upstream, and sail down past the ruined castles and monasteries, through the woods of beech and pine, making the birds rise in startled flocks at the unaccustomed sound of gentle folk taking their rustic ease. Even now there are pleasure boats from Symond's Yat nearby. Whether walking by its banks or gliding on its surface, one may still comprehend the almost metaphysical inspiration it was to Wordsworth when he wrote: \\n\\nOh sylvan Wye! Thou wanderer through the woods.\\nHow often has my spirit turned to thee.\\n\\n\\nFor the visitor to Britain, a week's trip journeying up the Wye Valley can be one of the most varied and rewarding of \\n\\nleisurely \\n\\nholidays. Of metropolitan pleasures there are frankly none, although there are a number of excellent small hotels, some of which are really restaurants with rooms of the kind to be found these days in Bucks County, Pa.\\n\\nIt is a journey that should be taken in the comfort of a rented car, but at a pace more commensurate with a carriage or mule train. Start at Chepstow, close to the southernmost point of the Welsh border, where you will have just crossed the Severn River Bridge by the M4 Motorway. England is behind you. From the bridge, you have seen the Wye flowing into the larger Severn River's tidal estuary and the sea. It is now yours to explore all the way to its source.\\n\\nChepstow's ancient castle has a dramatic setting, where the Wye finally uncoils itself to meet the ocean. Massive and rambling, the castle broods over river and town alike, the southernmost of that stone curtain of fortresses that separated the Anglo-Saxon English from their ancient adversaries, the Celtic Welsh. From Cheptow, the A466 road follows the river to the Roman town of Monmouth. It winds along a part of the Wye Valley made famous, at least to the British, by the painters J. M. W. Turner and Richard Wilson, by the poets Gray and Wordsworth, and by the Rev. William Gilpin, a writer who can be said to have invented the concept of the \\n\\npicturesque \\n\\nto define the beauty of this part of the Wye.\\n\\nOn this same River Road the valley soon widens as you approach Tintern Abbey. In \\"Wales,\\" by Peter Sager, published last year by Pallas in London and certainly the best book on the country, the great watercolorist Samuel Palmer is quoted as seeing Tintern very much as you will discover it, looking across the meadows to the river: \\". . . Such an Abbey. The lightest Gothic, trellised with ivy and arising from a wilderness of orchards -- and set like a gem amidst the folding of woody hills.\\" The orchards have gone. But the sheer magnificence of the mighty Cistercian abbey remains, its bleached stones reaching heavenward as if in a confident devotion that still defies King Henry VIII's act of sacrilege, and reminds us of the pure faith that made medieval men seek such solitude and beauty in which to save their souls.\\n\\nWhether or not your soul has been refreshed by contemplation of the abbey, it is time to think of creature comforts. It is a short drive (north on the A466 to the B423) to Newland, where the Ostrich pub will provide an excellent lunch, or if you have walked and sightseen enough you can try either The Crown at Whitebrook or The Village Green at Trellech. At both the cooking is inspired by France, using delicious local ingredients. The food and wine are a mite better at The Village Green, but the bedrooms are more numerous and better appointed at The Crown. If you prepare your own food, the Flanesford Priory, just across the border back in England, is a wonderfully atmospheric conversion of an old monastery into small comfortable apartments, snuggling close to the Wye, beneath the monumental ruins of splendid Goodrich Castle.\\n\\nWhere the Wye greets its tributary, the Monnow, it makes of the two rivers a natural moat, defensive, since Roman times, for the key border town of Monmouth. Right in the middle of its High Street the local archeological society is digging in an abandoned shop, peeling back layer upon layer of the former Monmouths. They are farther back and deeper down than the sidewalk that Geoffrey of Monmouth (1100-1154) trod when he wrote his \\"History of Britain\\" and told the world, for the first time, the fabulous story of King Arthur, a Romanized Celtic king, and his magician guardian, the great Merlin. Of the castle that once marked Monmouth as a doughty stronghold there is little left. But over the Monnow, the Norman bridge and its 13th-century gatehouse still stand. It is unique in Britain, and it is still possible to imagine it being used to repel surging attacks of pikemen and battering rams with caldrons of boiling oil.\\n\\nTHE marketplace at Monmouth is called Agincourt Square after a battle won by another famous son, King Henry V, whose great speech on the eve of the conflict inspired that most famous of Welsh captains, Fluellen. The king's effigy stands on the front of the fine Georgian shire hall. In front and below him is a statue of Charles Stewart Rolls, son of a local aristocrat, whose partnership with an engineer called Royce created arguably the world's most famous car. He is seen holding a miniature copy of the plane in which he crashed to his death after making the first return flight over the English Channel.\\n\\nMonmouth really has only one good place to eat, but that happens to be the best pub in several counties. The Punch Bowl has a landlord, who closely resembles a robust version of Mr. Punch. His salmon, his oysters and his meats are first class. Whether you order the hearty sandwiches or dine in the restaurant you will be eating the very best of well-cooked unadorned British food, the kind Samuel Johnson and Boswell might have enjoyed on one of their tours.\\n\\nThe Wye now leads you into England for a while. Proceed north, via the A40, to the well-signed turn to Goodrich Castle. A short walk from the parking lot and you can climb the ramparts for your first view of that greenest of still rustic English counties, Herefordshire","excerpt":"where, along with Hertfordshire and Hampshire, Eliza Doolittle was advised in \\"My Fair Lady\\" that hurricanes hardly happen. In fact, in the last three years, there have been two.) Quite different now is the setting for the river's journey: a great green and gold and brown patchwork quilt of farmland, with fenny streams lined by larch and willow, and little towns and villages nestling around impossibly pointed spires of ancient churches. In each church the tribal memory of its people is memorialized in tombs and stained glass and, sometimes, the tattered battle flags of long-forgotten regiments, listing their victories, never their defeats.\\n\\nRoss-on-Wye is a bustling market town, set upon a cliffside overlooking the river. The firm of Bylaw boasts a reproduction antique furniture maker so good that you should wonder seriously about the provenance of much that is sold as English antiques back home. Between Ross and the ancient city of Hereford is a great spread of shallow fertile valleys -- the Wye itself, the Golden Valley and the valley of the Lugg. English towns and villages grew up near or around their churches, their castles and their manor houses, many of which are open to the public. For those who find traipsing around country houses a bore, there is, however, one must in this area. It is a house called Hellen's at Much Marcle, the most perfect setting for a gothic murder mystery imaginable. So old are parts of Hellens, that you can still see where, in the early 1300's, the wicked Roger Mortimer brought his mistress, the Queen Isabella, and the baby Prince of Wales, after he had imprisoned, and condemned to a vile death, her husband and his king, Edward II. (Marlowe gives all the gory details!) \\n\\nIn this seldom visited house is a room especially furnished for Bloody Mary (Queen Mary I), and, touchingly, most of the house was last decorated, partly with gilded leather wallpaper, for a marriage in 1640, just before the English Civil War. The bridegroom rode off to war through a gate that was closed behind him, and, since he never returned, it remains closed to this day. In one bedroom a scandalous daughter, who had eloped with a laborer, was imprisoned for the rest of her life. Repentant little verses can be seen scratched on the window pane. The house contains some pictures, which almost anywhere else would justify the founding of a small but important gallery. Here they hang, imperfectly lighted, but probably perfectly content to live with their contemporaries, the quite palpable ghosts of Hellen's. \\n\\nIf pretty churches of great antiquity please you, these valleys boast an embarrassment of riches. I recommend those at Foy and Sellack, both on the Wye itself, both with pleasant walks upon the public footpaths nearby (look out for these, they are ubiquitous all over this part of Britain. It is worth buying local Ordinance Survey Maps from a news dealer. The maps mark footpaths and roads and are very large in scale.) Perhaps the most remarkable \\n\\nexterior \\n\\nof any church is at Kilpeck (circa 1140), with carved figures that guard the door and little gargoyle-like creatures that ring the church at the corbel level. There are several pubs at which to eat in the valley; the Lough Pool, near Hoarwithy, and the Green Dragon at Hereford, the latter a modest inn, close to the cathedral.\\n\\nHEREFORD'S cruciform cathedral dates from the 11th century, and lacks either the perpendicular grace of Canterbury Cathedral or the Renaissance felicities of Ely. However, is august assurance outside and its sturdy magnificence inside, together with some exquisite little side chapels, make it well worth visiting. It also houses two extraordinary possessions. The Mappa Mundi, one of the most elaborate medieval world maps in Europe, painted by Richard of Haldingham around 1300, places Jerusalem at the very center. Hereford's other treasure is its chained library of 1,500 books both handwritten and printed, the largest of its kind in the world. Seventy of the books were printed before 1500, two by William Caxton. Because they are chained to the shelves they can be read but not removed.\\n\\nStill following the River Wye upstream, we turn at Hereford once more toward Wales, whose border it meets again at Hay-on-Wye. Before entering this most unusual little town, it is time to consider where to stay. There are plenty of quite adequate bed and breakfasts, and a number of places that suggest Fawlty Towers more or less. Happily, some good alternatives exist at all prices: very superior furnished apartments can be rented at The Judge's House, an excellent conversion of the assize judges' manor; the Griffin Inn at Llyswen provides reasonably priced good food and accommodation, and Llangoed Hall, also at Llyswen, has first-class food, beautiful surroundings and considerable comfort. Trout or salmon fishing on the Wye can be arranged at the Griffin Inn or Llangoed Hall.\\n\\nHay-on-Wye is an attractive little town where every second store seems to be a bookshop. Some specialize in film, ballet, curiosa and the like. Others have vast general collections of books, mostly old. The shops huddle around a ruined castle, sacked in the civil war. Hay is the host, every May, to the Festival of Literature, one of the most important festivals of its kind in the English-speaking world, and indeed in Europe. The emphasis is on readings by well-known authors. Some of the stars this year were Joseph Heller, Sir William Golding, Simon Schama, Doris Lessing and Margaret Atwood.\\n\\nSouth and west of Hay are the Black Mountains, Wales's first line of defense in years gone by. Looking up at them from the lush meadows of English Herefordshire, they seem barren and forbidding, with often a swirling tide of cloud scudding astride their long smooth ridges. Behind them, the Welsh interior is a steady series of folds and valleys, peaks and canyons stretching to the ocean. There is a subtle grandeur in the beauty of this mountainous land.\\n\\nOn the final leg of the journey to the Wye's source, you travel almost due west via the A470. If it is July, and the Royal Welsh Show is in progress, it is worth pausing at Builth Wells to see the show's fine farm horses and cattle, fly casting and sheep shearing and to be tempted to wine tasting and all the fun of the fair. Otherwise, press on to Rhayader, a small mountain town where you will hear the Welsh language all round you, but where everyone is able to talk in English, too.\\n\\nRhayader is close enough to Hay (a two-hour drive away) that you could stay in a hotel near there, but in Rhayader happens to be one of the best of the many bed and breakfast houses you will have passed on your journey. It is owned by Pam Powell, whose homemade cakes should provide just the fortification you need for your hike up to the summit of Plynlimmon, the source of the Wye.\\n\\nThere, in 1401, Owain Glyndwr, one of the greatest of all Welshmen, raised his standard at the start of a campaign against the English that would briefly unite his countrymen in independent nationhood. On a rare clear day, you may even glimpse the Irish Sea. \\nPLACES TO STAY, PLACES TO EAT\\n\\n The following are among the places to stay and eat in the Wye valley:\\n\\nCrown at Whitebrook, Near Monmouth, Gwent NP5 4TX, Wales; telephone (600) 860254.

A1    'Outtakes' From Zarqawi Video  The American military, in an effort to mock Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and turn his own propaganda against him, released what it described as outtakes from the video he released last week, showing him seeming to struggle to fire a machine gun and wearing running shoes.   A1    Pope Condemns Chinese Church  Pope Benedict XVI condemned the official Chinese Catholic Church for consecrating two bishops against the Vatican's wishes, and raised the possibility of excommunicating the bishops.   A14    British Take Lead in Afghanistan  Britain took command of the NATO peacekeeping force in Afghanistan, in advance of expanding its role into the turbulent southern areas of the country in what a NATO representative called the alliance's most challenging operation to date.   A12    Rebels Rejecting Sudan Deal  As the latest deadline for a peace agreement between the Sudanese government and Darfur rebels passed, American, European and African leaders picked up the pressure on the rebels to sign it, but two insurgent groups were refusing.   A14    NATIONAL   A16-21    Moussaoui's Trial Ends In a Volley of Heated Words  A judge sentenced Zacarias Moussaoui to prison for the rest of his life, saying he will be denied his wish to die in a blaze of glory and instead ''will die with a whimper.'' And Mr. Moussaoui delivered a speech about his hatred for America.   A21    Focus on Bishop Election  Three of the seven candidates in the coming election of a new Episcopal bishop in California are openly gay and lesbian ministers in long-term relationships, and the selection of one of them could create a rift in the church, leaders say.   A16    Senate Approves Spending Bill  Setting the stage for a clash, the Senate approved a $109 billion measure to pay for the war in Iraq, Gulf Coast hurricane recovery and a potential flu pandemic, ignoring a veto threat by President Bush and a toughening line against added spending by House Republicans.   A18    Birth Control Use Drops  Contraception use, particularly among poor women, has plummeted over the last decade, making them more likely to get pregnant unintentionally and to have abortions, according to a new report.   A21    Guilty Plea in Spy Case  Leandro Aragoncillo, a naturalized American citizen and former Marine who worked in the White House for the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, pleaded guilty in federal court in Newark to passing top-secret information and documents to political opponents of the current Philippine government.   A18    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-8    Projected Cost Soars For Ground Zero Memorial  The projected cost to build the World Trade Center Memorial complex at ground zero has soared to $1 billion, according to the most authoritative estimate to date. Rebuilding officials concede that the new price tag is breathtaking and is sure to set off another bruising battle over development at the site.   A1    Mistrial in 9/11 Case  The trial of a man accused of lying to a panel investigating the Sept. 11 attacks ended in a mistrial after six days of angry deliberations audible through courtroom walls.   B1    Exam Scores Delayed  The company that handles educational testing in Connecticut encountered problems in scanning answers to tests taken recently by more than 45,000 high school sophomores across the state, delaying their scoring.   B3    SCIENCE/HEALTH    Report: NASA Projects in Peril  A new National Research Council report says that NASA has too many tasks and too little money to maintain a vigorous science program, a situation that threatens to erode the nation's leadership in space research and the goal of eventually sending humans to Mars.   A18    A New Study on Dread  The first study to look at where sensations of dread arise in the brain shows that it derives from the attention that people devote beforehand to what they think will be extremely unpleasant. The key to avoiding it, scientists say, is self-distraction.   A20    BUSINESS DAY   C1-11    G.O.P. and Gas Prices  Under pressure to deal with high gasoline prices, President Bush and Republican leaders in Congress are struggling to marry a newfound zeal for energy conservation with their traditional loyalty to big cars and Big Oil.

LONG ISLAND OPINION","excerpt":"WHERE'S THE SECRET INGREDIENT?"},{"year":"1995","title":"One of the most striking sequences in Universal's \\"Apollo 13\\" is the rocket launch, which is shot from a perspective that would be hard to mimic in reality. The digital effects group at Digital Domain in California rendered most of the elements electronically and then combined them for the movie scene. What made the launch especially difficult to create were the smoke, fire and ice that artists had to simulate. the lifelike rendering elements bodes well for the entire business of simulated photo realism: advertising flight simulators and virtual-reality surgery are among the area that will benfit from practical alternatives to real-world experiences, but only when compters can routinely process complex polygons to match the look of reality.\\nTY AHMAD-TAYLOR\\n-- How it was done\\n\\n The artists began with a helicopter photograph of a launch pad. They embellished the original, adding grass, shadow and a digital replica of the Saturn 5 launch pad by using a computerized painting program to alter the photograph\\n\\n For two large smoke effects. Kevin S. Mack, the digital effects art director. drew several plumes of smoke and layered copies of the plumes on top of one another. Each layer was then morphed, or distorted, to make the entire smoke image look real.\\n\\n The creation of the rocket's launch flame and smoke, as well as the coolant ice that slides off the rocket, was more complicated that the large plumes. The flame, for example, was drawn underneath the rocket as a three-dimensional image. Artists used what is called a computer particle system to cause the flames to shimmy and vibrate in space like real flame.\\n\\n The sequence was created at 24 frames a second, and each frame was altered separately. Some of the more complicated frames took a computer two hours each to complete. During a five-month period at the peak of production, Digital Domain used more than 100 artists.\\n\\n The final scene, shown, below, was put together using a process called composting, where the smoke plumes, exhaust, rocket model, scenery and launch pad were integrated electronically.\\nOther applcations\\n\\nIt is extremely hard, if not impossible, to show realistic computer-generated ice, fog, flame or even clouds in real time. Flight simulators, for example, like the NASA aviation training program shows below, render multi-faceted elements like clouds as crude, chunky shapes.\\n\\n W. Jeff Morgan of Graphic Simulations in Dallas uses a technique in his simulation programs that alters the density of a cloud depending on the pilot's proximity to that cloud, but concedes that personal computer processor speed is too slow to make realistic clouds possible.\\n\\n Artists can use the painstaking particle system process shows above in \\"Apollo 13\\" to generate snow, rain and bubbles under water in films and commercials. The effect is more convincing than conventional animation or large models, said Scott A. Ross, chief executive of Digital Domain.\\n\\n This commercial, put together by Lintas, Campbell & Ewald and Digital Domain, features a sport-utility vehicle moving seamlessly from a rainy environment to a snowy one and then to dry pavement. The camera never cuts from the vehicle, and the ability to animate the various rain and snow elements by computer help to portray a seamless journey through impossible conditions.

Citrano's storefront law office at 77 Baxter Street is just across the street from the rear of the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building, at 100 Centre Street, which gives him an edge in practicing a courtroom specialty that many criminal defense lawyers tend to look down on.   Mr. Citrano represents defendants at their moment of entry into the chaotic world of the courts, their first appearance before a judge for arraignment.   It is a specialty that places him on what many regard as the lowest rung of the criminal justice ladder. But don't pine for him. Mr. Citrano says he likes it. So thank you very much.   \\"I'm like the telephone company,\\" said Mr. Citrano, whose office is in earshot of the holding cells where the defendants are kept before their court appearances. \\"I can almost reach out and touch them.\\" A sign on the door of his storefront office says he will do it 24 hours a day.    Years ago, many of the lawyers who handled first arraignments often waited outside the courts jockeying among themselves in a kind of legal bazaar in the hope that a lawyerless defendant would hire them. But the advent of the Legal Aid Society and a panel of state-appointed lawyers who handle most arraignments on a per diem basis ended that method of finding clients.    For the 62-year-old Mr. Citrano, who also handles hearings, plea bargains and an occasional trial, representing defendants he has never seen before and might never see again is no problem. As far as he is concerned, the Spences, Kunstlers, Slotnicks and Dershowitzes can have all those high profile, splashy trials, the ones where legal brillance and personality can determine a client's fate.   \\"Sure, the arraignment courts are the pits,\\" Mr. Citrano said recently while gazing across Baxter Street at the Manhattan House of Detention.    \\"But I'm proud of handling arraignments because if it wasn't for lawyers like me practicing meat and potatoes law those people inside over there would never have a lawyer who really knows how to get them out.    \\"You can put the F. Lee Baileys of this world in a Manhattan arraignment court and they wouldn't know what to do,\\" he said.    William M. Kunstler, a prominent defense lawyer and civil rights advocate, agreed. \\"I'd probably be lost at an arraignment because I never do them,\\" he said. Ira London, the defense lawyer who represented Joel B. Steinberg, concurred, saying that the Frank J. Citranos of the criminal-justice system \\"perform a valuable service to the courts and their defendants because they know arraignments better than anyone else.\\"   \\"I never take an arraignment without consulting with one of them first because they know better than I what alternative non-jail programs are available,\\" Mr. London said.    \\"It's not the most sought-after legal practice because the issues are not that complicated,\\" said Judge Charles H. Solomon, who presides over Manhattan Criminal Court and has handled his share of arraignments. \\"They are a very necessary function in which procedural skills are a key to success.\\"    Prosecutors and defense lawyers also say it does not hurt to know the various clerks and court officers who keep the cases moving. Mr. Citrano seems to know most of them by their first names. As a consequence, they might be willing to make sure his case gets on the docket a little faster.    Most of the cases that Mr. Citrano, a New York Law School graduate, handles are drug related. His clients are sometimes street dealers.   Criminal justice experts say that there is only one legal issue to argue at arraignments in felony cases","excerpt":"whether defendants are denied bail.    That's when a Mr. Citrano can come in handy.    \\"In a matter of seconds,\\" Mr. Citrano said, \\"I can read the complaint and the defendant's record and get an immediate sense if I can argue for release without bail or ask for one low enough that my client can make it immediately.    \\"I also make sure that if the defendant has a family that they're there in court for the judge to see,\\" he said. \\"What gives me an edge is I like the circus atmosphere.\\" Centre Street Journal; Bar's Battlers for Bail: Advocacy, Day or Night"},{"year":"2004","title":"Securities and Exchange Commission delays final approval of Google's registration statement","excerpt":"whether delay is merely procedural or whether it involves matters of substance to SEC cannot be determined; Google's next big challenge if it does finally succeed in its initial public offering will be proving that its success is not accident, that company can survive from one technological generation to next; graph (M) So Google Is Almost Public.

The act of writing is private","excerpt":"whether done with a quill pen or a personal computer, it is singularly uninvolving to the looker-on.   The New Zealand director Jane Campion is well aware that writers writing, or even thinking about writing, look pretty silly. For the most part, she succeeds in avoiding the problem in \\"An Angel at My Table,\\" a fine, rigorous adaptation of three autobiographical novels by Janet Frame, the New Zealand novelist and short-story writer.   In the final third of the film, when Janet (Kerry Fox) has been published and her talent recognized, it would seem that the most important moments of her life are being lived off screen. Not yet, though. In one of the film's most agonizing (and most bleakly funny) sections, the 30-ish Janet falls into an affair, her first, with a stupendously boorish American professor of history who also thinks of himself as a poet. They meet in Spain. On their first night together, Janet is thinking about sex. The poetaster is thinking about words, but with no feeling for them whatsoever.   He repeatedly interrupts their lovemaking to ask her opinion about a verse he's working on. She answers as gently as possible in the hope that he will get on with things.   It's a difficult moment. Janet's intellectual sensibility is pitted against her naked longings. It's no contest: sex triumphs over literature. Yet at the end of his holiday, when the idiot comes to say goodbye, she refuses to open the door to him.   The new film can't be casually compared with \\"Sweetie,\\" Miss Campion's dense, splendidly original first feature. \\"An Angel at My Table\\" is not, strictly speaking, a movie at all. It's a television mini-series whose three parts are being shown here together, which is not the way they were designed to be seen. It's a long movie, and somewhat loose.   It also has its origins in the life, emotions and imagination of someone else, a writer of an age (Miss Frame was born in 1924) and a complexity that would seem to be utterly foreign to the young film maker.   Where \\"Sweetie\\" is a work of the film maker's imagination left to its own devices, \\"An Angel at My Table\\" is the record of what helped to shape the imagination of the writer. The movie must pay attention to facts.   The wonder of \\"An Angel at My Table\\" is that so much of it plays as if it had sprung from the imagination of the same young woman who made \\"Sweetie.\\" About the film's Janet Frame there is always something that seems a little bit possessed. For her the world is brighter, shinier, more limpid and more dangerous than for anyone else. The film covers a great swatch of time, beginning with Janet as a little girl (played by an enchanting young actress named Alexia Keogh), and proceeding through her teen-age years (when she is played by Karen Fergusson) until she emerges in the person of Kerry Fox, who is remarkably vivid and strong as the haunted adult Janet.   Also remarkable is the casting. The three actresses blend so well into one another that the transitions are virtually unnoticeable.   Janet is one of the middle children of the six born to a railway engineer and a woman of some literary bent. It is not an especially unhappy household, though it is a strict one. Janet's older brother is epileptic. There are later misfortunes that affect Janet far more than anyone else in the family. While she is studying to be a teacher, she suffers a series of breakdowns that eventually lead to a mental hospital.   Except for the publication of a collection of her short stories and the favorable reviews it receives, she would have been lobotomized.   The movie must elide so much material that it comes as some surprise to the audience that the hospitalized Janet ever had time to write those stories. There are other narrative omissions that might not be evident to an audience watching the film in installments. For all of the casual brutality of the hospital scenes, \\"An Angel at My Table\\" seems a very gentle film about a woman of such a passionate nature. It's not easy, though, to dramatize the passion of someone who feels deeply about language, and who knows at the age of 12 or so that she wants to be a poet.   The movie records the world as Janet sees it, sometimes incredibily beautiful and as often frightening. It remains steadfastly objective and a little puzzled, as if recognizing the impossibility of ever knowing the mind itself, except through books.

By Phil Lesh. (Little, Brown, $25.95.) It's hard to say which of these miracles is more profound: the fact that after three decades with the Grateful Dead, Lesh has any memories of the experience whatsoever, or that he's been able to consolidate them into a single volume of less than 20,000 pages. In his marvelously economical and engrossing memoir, Lesh, the band's bassist, recounts the Dead's creation against the backdrop of the Bay Area's beatnik culture and its historic performance at Woodstock (and nonperformance at Altamont), but he also takes a frank look at the drug abuse that marred the group's later years, as well as his own struggles with alcohol and with liver disease. Through it all, Lesh proves to be as capable and enthusiastic a writer as he is a musician","excerpt":"whether he's describing the ''immense, turbulent, Druidic'' snoring of Jerry Garcia, the ''saber-toothed crotch cricket'' hum of the Woodstock sound system or a road-trip travel game called ''Radio I-Ching,'' he consistently exhibits a peculiar and poetic fondness for language, transforming what could have been a routine exercise in nostalgia into a work as graceful and sublime as a box of rain.   Dave Itzkoff    LIKE A ROLLING STONE: Bob Dylan at the Crossroads. By Greil Marcus. (Public-Affairs, $25.) The books written about Bob Dylan could fill up a bookcase -- and any suspicions that the publication of Dylan's extraordinary memoir, ''Chronicles,'' would slow the tide seem premature. ''I've written a lot of books and after reading Dylan's book, I realized I would never write a book that good,'' Marcus said recently. Yet that hasn't stopped him from trying. Marcus's latest -- published eight years after ''Invisible Republic,'' his exploration of Dylan's ''Basement Tapes'' album with the Band -- is a ''biography'' of the singer's signature hit, a single that Rolling Stone magazine recently selected as the greatest song of all time. (Some readers might begin to wonder if Marcus's next book will be an exegesis of the chorus to ''Jokerman.'') Marcus, the author of such landmarks as ''Mystery Train,'' perhaps the finest book ever written about pop music, can still deliver blazing insight. His description of the pure sonics of ''Like a Rolling Stone'' -- a sound so complete and perfectly realized that it ''never plays the same way twice'' -- forces you to approach a 40-year-old song with new ears. The song ''promises a new country,'' Marcus writes; ''now all you have to do is find it.'' But too many tropes in Marcus's cultural criticism are starting to feel overfamiliar, and too much of his own Dylanology is starting to fold in on itself. This book's subtitle is ''Bob Dylan at the Crossroads''; the opening line of ''Invisible Republic'' was ''Once a singer stood at a world crossroads.''

We feel sure Twentieth Century-Fox would appreciate it if Frankie would tell Shirley Temple his secret.At the Modern PlayhouseTwo of Hungary's most appealing actresses, in a quiet sort of way, Ida Turay and Klari Tolnay, do excellent work as a prankish, but kind pupil, and a demure teacher in a commercial school for girls, in \\"Magdat Kicsapjak\\" (Magda Is Expelled), now at the Modern Playhouse. Antal Pager is fairly natural as a British-Hungarian business man, and George Nagy fills the bill as the cousin who accompanies him on a trip to Budapest in search of romance.You see, the letters written by the stenography students are addressed to a supposedly imaginary Liverpool business man. As a way of breaking the monotony of her routine life, the pretty teacher writes love letters to the same chap. Through Magda's fault one of these missives gets mailed. The rest is easy. Magda is expelled from school, but she and her teacher are properly compensated for their troubles. Laszlo Vajda directed the film for the Ferenc Pless concern.At the Teatro LatinoIf \\"Los Dos Cadetes,\\" the current picture at the Teatro Latino, was started with the intention of \\"glorifying\\" the Mexican Military Academy, the idea evidently got lost early in the proces of manufacture, with the result that the army school is merely the background for a routine comedy romance. There is no gainsaying the fact that there is lots of fun in this apparently aged production, mostly because of the excellent work of Sara Garcia, as a devout maiden lady whose plan to make her likely nephew (Julian Soler) a priest is wrecked, with happy results. Blonde Maria Fernanda Ibañez, as the principal girl in the case, has little to do, but she looks nice all the time. José Alcalde Gamis is satisfactory as the other cadet.

Sports of The Times","excerpt":"Which Is It?"},{"year":"1921","title":"\\"When Gabriele d'Annunzio's \\"Cabiria\\" rose like a cinematographic sun on the motion picture world in 1914 great was the brightness thereof. It was luminous and spread its light over wide areas of the public then lying far beyond the screen's horizon. People who had never deigned to go to the movies before went to see it, and came away saying it was the greatest picture they had ever seen. And others who had seen several other productions said the same thing. For seven years \\"Cabiria\\" has lived in the memory of many as, to them at least, the greatest motion picture ever made. And now it is revived this week at the Strand and must stand the test of comparison with the screen's achievements since 1914.It will come through the test with its colors unlowered. To say that it really is the greatest picture ever made would be going too far. In a number of ways the screen has advanced since it was produced, while it, apparently, has slipped back, upsetting, in a way, the common assumption that a motion picture once made is forever and always the same. Visual memory is not perfect, but it seems safe to say that the pictures in the \\"Cabiria\\" of 1914 were clearer, in better relief as to details, than those to be seen now at the Strand. On the assumption that the print used is new, the conclusion must be that the negative, for some reason, has faded a little. Whatever the cause, many who see the picture are likely to complain of its dimness, not because they are really unable to distinguish its important details or to get the effect of its magnificent scenes, but because it is so much less clear than the finely distinct pictures of today.But the less finished photography of seven years ago, or the fading of the negative, whichever it is, cannot obscure the enduring greatness of \\"Cabiria.\\" It remains a great motion picture, one which any one can well afford to see twice and which no one who wants to follow the screen can afford to miss. In some of its particulars it has never been equalled and in others it has never been surpassed.Only the recent German productions, for example, approach it in the richness and authenticity of its historical retting. As is generally known, its period is that of the Punio Wars, and those qualified to know have testified that it brilliantly reproduced much of the atmosphere and appearance of the world of Rome and Carthage. There are no scenes of Rome, but Carthage has been reconstructed, while the Roman fleet and methods of fighting, as well as the Romans themselves, are restored. The picture, in fact, brings rather a vague part of history vividly to life. It is absorbingly interesting.In this setting is a melodrama. A shrewd person who had never heard of \\"Cabiria\\" might approximate the date of its production by the loose, episodic nature of its continuity and the amount of running about, jumping, pursuing and fleeing indulged in by its characters. Clearly it belongs to the perpetual-motion age of motion pictures. But, whereas in an ordinary work of this age, the motion would seem confusing and crazy-wild, in \\"Cabiria\\" it is employed so efficiently, it is so well directed toward its end without overflow of aimless activity, that it serves to animate for all what otherwise would be a purely historical work of restricted appeal.The figure that stands out most, of course, is that of Maciste, whose real name, it is said, is Ernesto Pagani. This towering but well-formed and graceful giant fascinates the eye. He is an extraordinary physical specimen, and yet not a mere exhibit. He acts, he is a part of the story, he is convincing. Next to his, the most graphic characterization is that of the wineshop keeper by Antonio Branioni. This miserable little man is placed opposite Maciste in a number of scenes and the effect is striking.But, though \\"Cabiria\\" is full of details, many of them of really dramatic or melodramatic quality, it is as a spectacle, as a pageant, that it holds its own with the best pictures of today, and so the chief credit for its production must go to Gabriele d'Annunzio, the poet, who conceived it, and to Giovanni Pastrone, who directed it. Through their labors, Italy reached a peak of motion picture accomplishment. Now that the war is over, she should go still higher.It is commonly believed that no motion picture program can exist without a five or six-reel photoplay as its central feature, but several years ago when S. L. Rothafel was manager of the Rialto and Rivoli Theatres, he twice dispensed with the photoplay and interested numerous spectators with what, in the trade, are called short subjects. Now Mr. Rothafel is at the Capitol and again he is offering a program in which the longest picture, a comedy, fills only three reels. And, although it includes no film of extraordinary character, the program at the Capitol this week will undoubtedly prove much more interesting to many persons than the usual bill with its featured photoplay","excerpt":"which is more positive proof that the motion picture theatre is not altogether dependent upon the photoplay than if the Capitol's entertainment included some distinctly unusual number.After the overture, \\"Pomp and Circumstance,\\" comes the interesting Capitol News, and then, in pictorial order, \\"The Ghost of John Barleycorn,\\" mainly composed of pre-Volstead drinks shown in colors—not a new picture, but more historic, and for many, more fascinating or infuriating, than when it was first shown a year or more ago. If the anti-prohibition parade today lacks spirit, let the leaders take the marchers to see this picture—and then watch out, Mr. Volstead.After a ballet in which Mlle. Gambarelli Alexander Oumansky and others take part, there comes what many persons will probably consider the most interesting number on the program a set of Charles Urban's Kineto subjects, \\"Ancient Customs of Egypt,\\" \\"Science of the Soap Bubble,\\" \\"From Egg to Chick,\\" \\"Rare Animals\\" and \\"The Tortoise and the Hare,\\" all as entertaining as informative, which is what the so-called educational pictures should be. Then there is a two-reel photo-story, \\"The Northern Trail,\\" based on a story by James Oliver Curwood, a fairly interesting but mediocre melodrama of the North, redeemed somewhat by excellent and refreshing snow scenes and the sincere acting of Lewis Stone; and finally there is Harold Lloyd's latest farce, \\"Among Those Present,\\" a not distinctly original, but nevertheless a frequently funny stretch of nonsense.\\"The Conquering Power,\\" directed by Rex Ingram, who made \\"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,\\" with most of the cast of that picture, is the principal attraction at the Rivoli, and \\"Behind Masks,\\" with Dorothy Dalton, is at the Rialto.

His tuneful Viennese melodies are played and sung sufficiently well to draw one's attention, at times, from the rather silly performance that accompanies them.The central characters in this blend of Viennese operetta and French farce are Fritz Eisenstein, an incurable philanderer, and his faithful but resentful wife, Rosalinde. One of Eisenstein's escapades has provoked a jail sentence for eight days, but he obtains a brief reprieve because the prison is full. After planning to spend his last night of freedom with his wife, he decides, instead, to go to a ball, where, between flirtations, he may cajole the judge into pardoning him.Rosalinde, meanwhile, is visited by two suitors, one of whom, Herr Falke, eventually is carried off to prison as the culprit \\"Eisenstein.\\" Rosalinde then disguises herself, goes to the ball and, as has happened in so many farces, is wooed by her own husband. The by-this-time much wrinkled plot finally is ironed out in the jail. Incidentally, the adaptation has been a most liberal one and bears little resemblance to \\"Die Fledermaus.\\" The film, in brief, is much closer to \\"Waltz Time\\" than to \\"The Bat.\\"Evelyn Laye, the British actress, whose charm no one can deny, has not much opportunity to display her talents in this production. She is an undeniably attractive, but exceedingly unnatural Rosalinde. Fritz Schulz, a German singer, does well enough in the rôle of the husband and Gina Malo, as a maid, and Jay Laurier, as the tippling jailer, contribute a few moments of comedy. The picture is at its best, however, when Frank Titterton, Parry Jones, George Baker or an entire chorus are raising their voices in song","excerpt":"which means, simply, that Johann Strauss has done more for \\"Waltz Time\\" than has Gaumont-British.

How do astronomers decide how far away a star is?   A. There are several ways of measuring the distance of stars or other faraway objects","excerpt":"which one is best depends on how distant the object is. For example, if a star is comparatively nearby, the method of annual parallax can used: the angular direction of the star from the earth varies slightly as the earth moves around its orbit, and a trigonometric equation can be constructed using the earth's orbital plane as the baseline. This works only for stars up to about 100 light years away. At somewhat greater distances, so-called spectroscopic parallax comes into play; certain types of stars have characteristic light spectrums that reveal what their actual brightness probably is, and their distance can then be estimated from how bright they appear from earth. The distance of some faraway stars, the so-called Cepheid variables, which become brighter and dimmer at known rates, can be estimated because the period of their brightness cycle is known to be proportional to their true brightness; when true brightness has been thus determined, apparent brightness can again be used to measure the distance of the stars, or the distance of clusters containing such stars. Distances of more than a million light years have been measured in this way. At extremely great distances, measured in the billions of light years, the expansion of the universe implies that everything is moving away from us and the faster it is moving the farther off it is.

To this day, Mr. Spielberg says he continues to be fascinated by ''what I think is there but cannot see,'' and that capacity for wonder, combined with a prodigal imagination, has informed nearly all his films from ''Jaws'' to ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' to ''Raiders of the Lost Ark.''

More and more dealers are sharing spaces, forging “Survivor”-like alliances to avoid being voted off next year, when the fought-after spots are reassessed by the new regime. Mary Boone and Rafael Jablonka from Cologne have the smartest set-up: a room each to do with as they will and a third make-nice space for Eric Fischl, the one artist the two galleries share… Massive steroid-charged artwork is not limited to the main fair. It also gets a workout at Pulse, where there is a courtyard stocked with jacked-up sculptures by Jurgen Mayer, Chris Larson and the tattooist-cum-fine artist Duke Reilly. Reilly’s work is a replica of a revolutionary war submarine called the “Turtle,” which in truth looks more like an old whisky barrel. The larkish Reilly submerged his work in the Hudson River early this year and “attacked” the QM2, an offence which got him arrested (the $120,000 tag for the piece includes a video of his capture)… It’s not just the wholesale appropriation trend that is trying the patience of gallerists.

Potter.  \\n\\nFor six and thirty hours snow had fallen in the valley of the Engadine.  It was not the soft snow of England, which flutters down in heavy flakes like the petals of roses overblown, but a blinding storm, tenuous as a Scotch mist, driven by the wind from the Alpine heights. I had taken a place in the post chaise that went from St. Moritz into Italy, and when I reached the office I found waiting already a closed sleigh, gaudily painted in yellow, drawn by four horses. Three persons had taken their seats, and it held but four. The driver mounted his box, and the postman climbed up beside him. We carried the mails to Chiavenna and to the villages by the wayside. Leaving St. Moritz, with its fashionable gaieties and its vast hotels, we descended the hill silently. Below was the lake, frost-bound and covered with snow","excerpt":"while all around, like a vast amphitheater, were the white mountains.

Dear Diary:    With the arrival of each summer, I find myself completely at odds over how to spend my weekends. I've never fancied the weekend commute to the country, and it's always been a bit out of my financial reach. But I always make a terrific guest. I bring great gifts, clean up after myself and always am filled with sparkling conversation.    So how is it possible that my dog, Maggie, has received more invitations to the country than I have?   It began in May, when I was taking a vacation in the Caribbean. My friend Barbara had offered to take care of Maggie while I was away. One weekend, Barbara took Maggie to her friend's country house in Bucks County, Pa. Maggie was so popular during her visit that she was recently invited back.    There I was on Friday afternoon, packing her weekend doggy bag and waiting on the sidewalk for Barbara to pull up in her newly rented car. Maggie was so excited to see her, as soon as the rear car door was opened, she jumped in and never looked back. I couldn't shake the image of Maggie lounging across a manicured lawn, sipping Bellinis.   On Sunday night, when I went to pick up Maggie, there she was, wagging that tail, but only mildly happy to see me. Barbara told me all about what fun they had, how well-behaved she was and that she was certainly invited to come back whenever she wanted. Barbara also added with a crooked smile, \\"You just have to realize that your dog has her own set of friends.\\" -- SETH ADLEMAN                    . . .         Letter from a philosophically inclined friend:   Curious how in this cynical city, we are surrounded by strangers with no connections and manage to avoid exchanging conversations with them until one day . . .    On a beautiful morning, I was heading downtown on a Lexington Avenue bus. I stood in the rear daydreaming, grasping a pole with one hand and twirling my hair around the forefinger of my other hand, a habit I've had as far back as I can remember.   Suddenly, a voice from out of the blue -- or rather, from out of the man seated in front of me: \\"My daughter used to do that -- twirling her hair.\\"   Startled out of my daydreams, I dropped my hand and ceased what I had been doing.   \\"It's a bad habit of mine,\\" I said with some embarrassment, \\"but it seems I've been doing it forever.\\" My mother used to tell me I'd wind up with a big bald spot if I didn't stop. My father claimed his sister had the same habit and that hunks of her hair did indeed disappear forever. I asked my new traveling acquaintance what happened to his daughter. \\"She died at a young age during childbirth,\\" he said.   \\"I'm so sorry,\\" I offered.   During the rest of the trip, neither of us spoke. At the next stop, we both coincidentally got off. We waved goodbye and headed in opposite directions.    I'll probably never see him again. But I do think of him and his daughter whenever I catch myself twirling my hair.                    . . .         Standing on the corner of Avenue of the Americas and Minetta Lane after a theater performance recently, Jimmy Nicholas, a New York printing executive, flagged a taxi to take his wife and a friend to dinner.   As the taxi approached, so did a giant waterbug, that scourge of New York summers. As the women watched in horror, the bug veered from a puddle and scurried toward the door of the taxi.    Mr. Nicholas squashed it.   \\"I had to,\\" he told the crowd at the corner, which burst into applause. \\"It was trying to steal our cab.\\" Metropolitan Diary"},{"year":"1936","title":"GERMANY WATCHES -- AND AWAITS EVENTS","excerpt":"While Apples of Discord Ripen in Europe She Remains Calm and Explores the Frontier of Her Opportunities GERMANY IS WATCHING -- AND WAITING While Apples of Discord Ripen in Europe, She Remains Calm, Exploring Her Opportunities"},{"year":"1998","title":"Federal Surface Transportation Board will hold hearings on plans by Norfolk Southern and CSX to take over Conrail, only major freight carrier serving Northeast","excerpt":"while approval is expected, the board, striving to make amends for Union Pacific debacle two years ago when Union Pacific acquired Southern Pacific, has already attached tougher conditions and oversight to Conrail's acquisition (M) Transportation Board Ponders Planned Conrail Takeover"},{"year":"1932","title":"Returns to U S from conf of interoceanic fliers, Rome BUDGET GROUP'S AID ENDORSED BY MAYOR","excerpt":"While Approving Its Purpose, He Asks Leaders to Tell Him Their Plans in More Detail.

Any casual reading of the entire Roe v. Wade decision clearly demonstrates both how inaccurate and misleading Brill's statement truly is. For example, although Brill was correct in maintaining that Roe v. Wade permits legal abortions during the first trimester, the High Court decision goes well beyond that in scope.     Specifically, during the second trimester, or prior to viability, the court gave states the right to regulate abortions \\"in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\\" In no way is any legal consideration extended to the unborn child during this middle trimester by the court.   Moreover, it is interesting to note that within the third and final trimester of a pregnancy, the Court extends to the individual states the right to regulate abortion, except \\"for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\\" However, health is so loosely defined by the Court as to make it meaningless. For example, health is defined to mean \\"physical, emotional, psychological . . . woman's age, distressful life and the future, the unwanted child, the unwed mother.\\"    Finally, in view of the above, one of the horrors of Roe v. Wade is the magnitude of it, which, in effect, maintains that during the first two trimesters of a pregnancy, the unborn is of no value, unless the mother decides otherwise","excerpt":"while during the third and final trimester, the unborn is of questionable value, since states are not required to extend it legal protection.

The movie, which was a vast success in Chile, is playing at the First Avenue Screening Room today.The picture's strength springs from the extreme simplicity of the narrative, which was clearly designed for an audience of all classes. The acting style is plain, some of it close to pantomime; the plot, rather than the actors, is the star. A burly peasant kills a farm woman and her five children for no apparent reason. The one clue is the grinding poverty that both had always known—which serves as a reminder that the poor can turn on one another.In jail, the illiterate murderer is educated, converted to Catholicism, taught to value life as he never did before—and then executed. It's the agonizing buildup to his death that gives this film its emotional and political depth. The director condemns institutions (the church and the state) rather than individuals, and the system that perpetuates poverty and ignorance is cited as the true killer. Throughout, a benevolent prison system appears just as cruel as its most brutal counterparts.

A dozen years ago, precious little of this music was known: While guitarists cut their teeth on etudes by Sor and short works by Giuliani, the lion's share of the sonatas and extended variation sets those virtuosos composed for their own use languished unplayed on library shelves. Other guitar composers of the period were known only as references in guitar histories, or through exercises in method books - if their names were known at all.   In the last few years, much has been done to rectify our faulty view of the 19th-century guitar, and among the most recent guitar disks come several important additions to the picture. The most immediately captivating of these is Pepe Romero's latest collection, a collection of guitar and piano duets by Ferdinando Carulli and Anton Diabelli (Philips 410 396-1). In the interest of facilitating the instrumental balance and blend, rather than for strictly historical reasons, Mr. Romero plays an 1856 Torres guitar - an instrument early by today's standards, yet a bit late for this music","excerpt":"while his collaborator, Wilhelm Hellweg, plays a copy of a Mozart era fortepiano.
