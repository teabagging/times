To some extent, the explanations are correct, for the index markets have become prime tools for arbitragers and integral, if often little understood, facets of the equities markets - and most arbitragers would prefer to have it that way.   Just how do stock arbitragers operate? ''By the textbook, we try to find a stock that is trading at slightly different prices in two markets,'' said I.B. Krim, senior vice president at Rothschild Inc., the New York branch of the famous international banking house, which only handles institutional business.    But this is not the way the ''arbs'' operate today, Mr. Krim quickly added, ''because modern communications has made such price differentials extremely short lived. In truth, we arbs today are simply bankers. The price differentials we work with are interest rates, regardless of what stocks or index market we trade in.''

He was 88 years old.   No cause of death was given.   The son of an industrialist, he was born in Tblisi, Georgia. In 1922 he accompanied an exhibition of Soviet art to Berlin and went on to study architecture and engineering in Europe. He came to London in 1931 and set up Tecton, a co-operative of young architects committed to radical ideas, the next year.   In 1933 he was commissioned to design a luxury apartment block at Highgate in north London. Highpoint One, as the block was called, was the most conspicuous statement of the new \\"white architecture\\" in Britain. Many of its details, like S-curved balconies, became cliches in the 1950's.   After World War II, he concentrated on designing homes for blue-collar workers. Tecton broke up in 1948, and Mr. Lubetkin abandoned architecture to take up farming in Gloucestershire in western England.   In 1982, the Royal Institute of British Architects awarded him its Royal Gold Medal for Architecture.   Mr. Lubetkin married the architect Margaret Church in 1936. She died in 1978.

Like many of this photographer's views of the pyramids, this one includes human and animal figures in order to suggest, by contrast, the enormous size of the principal subject. The nearest figures, on a rise in the foreground, are already small. Then, in a valley far beyond them, say halfway to the pyramids, are figures so small that a standing man would be hidden by the turbaned head of a foreground figure.

By Jerrilynn D. Dodds. 247 pp. (Pennsylvania State University, $45.) There is a particular pleasure in learning about times so remote that fact reads like fabulous fiction. Vivified by the impassioned prose of Jerrilynn D. Dodds, an associate professor of architectural history at City College, this scholarly study moves out of the realm of academic archeology and into an intriguing overview of a pivotal period in Spanish history.\\n\\nMs. Dodds shows that the hybridization of Spain's Christian architecture was under way long before Muslim domination began in A.D. 711. Fifth-century Visigoth invaders, like many conquerors in history, used architecture to ratify their legitimacy, and the indigenous Spanish peoples reacted in kind. To guard its prestige and protect its mystery, the local church hierarchy built inward-turning sanctuaries far less accessible than the old, open Roman basilica form and introduced the distinctive horseshoe arch, a motif found nowhere else on the Continent.

A show at the CENTER FOR ARCHITECTURE offers a more nuanced view of these urban projects, which many consider one of architecture's most miserable failures. Today, their unbridled optimism may even spark a brief moment of nostalgia. Center for Architecture, 536 LaGuardia Place, Greenwich Village, (212)683-0023, through Sept. 10.    For an example of how much that landscape has changed, wander up to the MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK, where a number of architectural works by the Mexican firm TEN ARQUITECTOS are on view. The show focuses on a range of visions for New York projects, from a soaring residential-and-commercial tower in Spanish Harlem composed of glass and concrete slabs to a residential glass tower in TriBeCa whose facade looks as intricate as lace. Richly articulated, the works offer a more refined but cautious take on the contemporary city. Museum of the City of New York, Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672, through Oct. 30.    Finally, a grass-roots design approach can be gleaned at the MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, where a 20-foot model of the HIGH LINE project is suspended from the ceiling on cables. A segment of elevated tracks in the Manhattan meatpacking district that is being converted into a public park, the High Line has already sparked a stream of development projects by emerging firms like NEIL DENARI ARCHITECTS and WORK ARCHITECTURE COMPANY. But its allure stems from the delicacy with which it promises to weave together a variety of creative visions -- all in the service of the public interest.

A somewhat stodgy periodical, Architecture will continue as the house organ of the American Institute of Architects until the end of 1996.

Seeking temporary exemption from the laws of physics and the constraints of budget and program, architects have traditionally turned to visionary designs to project utopian futures, revisit lost pasts or explore the limits of imagination. BRODSKY & UTKIN (Princeton Architectural Press, Paper, $21.95) is a collection of 28 stunning etchings in the finest tradition of visionary architecture. An introductory essay by Lois E. Nesbitt, a New York City critic and artist, reviews the background of the two young Moscow architects, Aleksandr Brodsky and Ilya Utkin, and explains the special circumstances surrounding their work. Unlike Russian visionary designers of the 1920's, Mr. Brodsky and Mr. Utkin are dissidents, not revolutionaries. In place of the optimistic visions of the future proposed by an earlier generation, they offer a chilling critique of the recent past. Their etchings depict private worlds of fantasy hidden behind the false facades and dreary squares of an oppressive public realm. One of the most impressive aspects of these haunting images is the degree to which the designs transcend the specifics of the Soviet experience and touch on universal themes like loneliness and alienation. The two architects' etchings are visual parables for our times and affirm the continuing power of visionary design to provoke our consciences.

Some composer-players dwell on the problematic detail, not because it is crucial to the listener but because it gave them so much trouble in the first place.

State Dept seeks to complete pipeline security treaty with Canada to allay fears that Canadian route would be unreliable; neither Pres Ford nor Sen Henry Jackson have favored a project, because pipeline has aroused strong lobbying from Midwest states, which would benefit from Canadian route, and West Coast states and shippers, who favor El Paso; Arctic Gas's chief banker Morgan Stanley says project will require Fed 'back-stopping' in case of large cost overruns; costs are put at $9-billion in '75 dollars for Arctic Gas, and at $8-billion for El Paso, but Arctic Gas says El Paso figure neglects to include costs that would be incurred by elaborate displacement system El Paso proposes for feeding Alaskan gas from West Coast through interstate pipelines, reversing usual flow and pushing Tex-Okla gas northward and eastward; Arctic Gas proposal is also opposed by Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, Wilderness Soc and Audubon Soc, while El Paso, running in same corridor as oil line, would cause minimal environmental disruption;
