The Fund has also published a 1991 calendar illustrated with black-and-white photographs from the book.    The 91-page book was written by Andrew S. Dolkart, a New York architectural historian and adjunct professor at Columbia University, and describes more than 100 of Brooklyn's landmarks. They range from the most familiar, including Coney Island's Parachute Jump and the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, to the 295 year old Flatbush Reformed Dutch Church, the 150-year-old Weeksville Houses in Bedford-Stuyvesant and other lesser known but equally distinct reminders of the borough's past. The photographs were taken this year by Brooklyn photographer Tony Velez.   Single copies of the book and calendar are available free at Brooklyn Borough Hall, 209 Joralemon Street, but have to picked up in person.

David Lenefsky, chairman of the quasi-public corporation set up in 1981, is confident that the 37-member board, appointed by Mayor Koch and Brooklyn community organizations, has begun a reversal of fortune for the two-century-old former naval installation that once seemed destined to become a monument to unrealistic expectations and bad management.   The city's purchase of the Federal facility in 1968 prompted outsized predictions that the 265-acre installation containing 4.3 million square feet of indoor commercial space would soon bring 30,000 jobs to Brooklyn and new life to to the nearby Brooklyn neighborhoods of Fort Greene, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg.
