After seeing it yesterday at the Strand, with Bette Davis playing it the way she has, we still think \\"Elizabeth the Queen\\" is the way to describe it. It's Queen Bette's picture just as surely as Mr. Flynn is a good-looking young man who should be asked to do no more in pictures than flash an even-toothed smile and present a firm jaw-line. His Essex lacked a head long before the headsman got around to him.What set up the Anderson play when the Theatre Guild presented it in 1930 was the poetic quality of the dialogue he had written, the happy circumstance that a Lynn Fontanne and an Alfred Lunt were charging it with their rich vitality. (Mr. Lunt, of course, had no objection to the marquee's \\"Elizabeth the Queen.\\") Dialogue and performance remain the primary virtues of the film, although their aura has been less equally distributed. The glow comes always from that corner of the screen where Elizabeth sits or stands or stamps about. Sometimes it spreads to those around her, to a lady-in-waiting talking of her lover, to Francis Bacon in his political games, even (at times) breaking through the shallow surface of Mr. Flynn's Essex and making him seem almost genuine.If a picture ever rested upon an actress's slender shoulders, this one does upon Miss Davis's. It is an unfair burden, but she has carried it successfully, almost by force of will. How unfair the burden is may be judged when we remind you that Mr. Anderson's casually historic drama was no one-man show (or one-woman show, to put it more correctly), but a tale of conflict which depended upon the even matching of its two combatants. Essex and Elizabeth were lovers, true lovers, he said","excerpt":"but Essex was ambitious, Elizabeth jealous for her throne. They had quarrels and reconciliations, but there could be no reconciliation of his greed for power, her grasp of it. Essex went to the headsman's block; Elizabeth to her bitter reign. Neither had the victory.Fact may be on the physical side of Mr. Flynn's portrait of Essex: he was a young man (in his twenties to Elizabeth's sixties), fatuous and insincere. But Anderson's Essex was compounded not of fact but of a dramatist's good graces. He wanted him virile, saucy, hot-tempered, yet true. He wanted him to eye Elizabeth nut with a calf-look but the bold assurance of a favorite. He wanted him able to say of his bewigged, painted, yet fascinating mistress: \\"I love her, I hate her, I adore her,\\" with at least more conviction than this Essex has been able to muster. (Mr. Flynn recites the line with the sincerity of a small boy apologizing to his teacher for throwing spitballs.)Miss Davis has had to throw her entire weight into the film to offset this insufficiency, to add fire to scenes she knew were beginning to smoulder. Inevitably she has carried a few of them too far, has been guilty of exaggeration and mannered tricks. Significantly, these defects never are apparent in the Essex-less sequences; rarely less than apparent in those she shares with him.The film, of course, is stage struck and almost too heavily freighted on the literary side. But Mr. Anderson's writing is good to hear, and his adapters, Norman Reilly Raine and Aeneas MacKenzie, have employed and deployed it well. Michael Curtiz's direction has provided the illusion, if not the actuality, of movement and, with stunning Technicolor camera work, has created several memorable and beautiful sequences. It is a good film, one well worth seeing; how much better it might have been with an Essex worthy of Miss Davis's Elizabeth we can only surmise.At the 48th Street TheatreSo many good things have come out of Scandinavia during the last few years that they are being regarded as a matter of course in the film world. Nevertheless, the arrival yesterday of the captivating shadow of Signe Hasso, the new Swedish \\"find,\\" at the little Forty-eighth Street Theatre made even hardened reviewers sit up and take notice.Here is a lovely young actress who fully justifies the enthusiastic advance reports from her native land. From the moment she appears as the gay and youthful wife of a rising young architect (Sture Lager-wall) in \\"Vi Tvaa\\" (We Two), a Terrafilm production directed by S. Bauman, until the final touchingly sentimental scene in the maternity hospital Fröken Hasso is the cynosure of the spectators' sympathetic attention. Even while laughing at the reconciliation of the two husbands over enormous drinks of whisky the audience has her in mind.Stig Jarrell and Ilse-Nore Tromm are competent, as the other couple in this little lesson, in morality, and the veterans Gösta Cederlung and Carl Barcklind are excellent in supporting roles. The picture gives a good idea of life in middle-class circles in modern Sweden. There are plenty of English titles.

George Bernard Shaw has paid her high tribute—possibly the highest he has ever vouchsafed to any tragedienne. She was his Saint Joan, of course. When it was reported that Miss Thorndike was to appear in an all-British film, hopes ran high that so talented an actress would achieve the apparently almost impossible feat of satisfying the requirements of that section of the public which has convinced itself that nothing really good can come from Hollywood. One might question the existence of such a section, seeing the patronage accorded to American films","excerpt":"but even if it be an almost infinitesimal minority, it talks nineteen to the dozen, while the majority just pays its money and says nothing. When it was next reported that Miss Thorndike would appear in a play entitled \\"To What Red Hell\\" the highbrows rubbed their hands in glee. At last the world would see what British producers could do with such material as Percy Robinson's tragedy provided, acted by a company of consummate artists who would speak in a language that could be recognized as the King's English. The general public, it must be admitted, remained cold. The masses had never heard either of the play or its author. Only a very small moiety of the theatre-going public had had the good fortune to see Miss Sarah Allgood in the part of the Irishwoman whose son was condemned to death for a murder he had not committed. That moiety was not altogether agreeably surprised to hear that Miss Thorndike was to appear in Miss Sarah Allgood's creation.However, \\"To What Red Hell\\" was a good title, even an alluring title. Surely it would make an appeal to the unsophisticated masses, particularly when coupled with the name of Miss Thorndike!\\"To What Red Hell.\\"So Edwin Greenwood, who was engaged by Tiffany Productions to direct the picture, set to work, and \\"To What Red Hell\\" was practically completed as a silent film when the talking films came and upset the applecart. Nothing daunted, Mr. Greenwood transmogrified his production into an audible film. Had not Miss Thorndike a beautiful voice, one of those voices compounded of gold and silver which people write home about? Eventually \\"To What Red Hell\\" was ready for showing, and the \\"trade\\" was invited the other day to witness a private exhibition of its merits.I have not heard any very prodigious reports about its bookings. \\"The trade\\" does not seem to pin much faith in the capacity of high brow producers to judge what the general public is willing to pay its money to see. Possibly \\"To What Red Hell\\" may do very well; one hopes that it will, for it certainly is a meritorious effort and Miss Sybil Thorndike does possess a beautiful voice and is also a very talented actress.But unless the general public has an unsuspected and infinite capacity for reveling in horrors, \\"To What Red Hell\\" would not appear to hold fourth much promise of being a money-maker; and after all producing companies can hardly expect to please their shareholders unless they do make money.The Stage Not Endangered.As an effort to produce, by the medium of an audible film, the effects attained by the stage version in which people of real flesh and blood appear, \\"To What Red Hell\\" hardly justifies the belief that the cinema will sound the death knell of the \\"legitimate drama.\\" It has been suggested that this was not the fault of the actress, but that the film, originally designed to be a silent picture, was allowed to retain much of the business which was necessary when there was no dialogue.What the piece chiefly fails in is its lack of brisk action. It is slow to an almost intolerable degree. Criticism has also been made of the theme in which a drunken epileptic plays one of the chief parts. One recalls a melodrama once staged at the Vaudeville Theatre in the Strand. It had for its title \\"The Worst Woman in London.\\" It was the real melodramatic stuff at which the gallery might have been expected to howl and weep by turns. By some accident of fate it was over-acted, and the result, the fortunate result, was that \\"The Worst Woman in London\\" came to be talked of as \\"a scream\\" which everybody in town had to go and see. Suburbia did not trouble about it. However, Suburbia may flock in its millions to see \\"To What Red Hell.\\"Heather Thatcher.Another British talking film anent which there has been a good deal of anticipatory booming is a piece called \\"The Plaything,\\" in which another actress of renown, Miss Heather Thatcher, is the bright particular star. Miss Thatcher's talents are as different from Miss Thorndike's as the poles are asunder. Heretofore she has chiefly figured in musical comedy. Press notices which have an air of having been sent out by one and the same agency hail her as one of the great discoveries of the British film world. \\"The Plaything\\" is the first professional effort as a producer of Mr. Castleton Knight, who was formerly manager of the Capitol Cinema in the Hay-market. The work was done at the Elstree Studios. Beginning as a silent film, \\"The Plaything\\" develops into an audible picture and the recording is of quite fine quality. The story told is not particularly exciting. It is concerned with the adventures of a Highland laird who falls in love with a pleasure-loving London heiress. He follows her to night clubs and drinks innumerable cocktails in her company till he goes \\"broke.\\"Sir Harry Lauder.Sir Harry Lauder is seen and heard to good effect in \\"Auld Lang Syne,\\" in the course of which he sings several of his most successful songs and plays the part of an old Scotch farmer whose son and daughter are living in London, the one supposedly studying chemistry and the other also supposedly training to be a hospital nurse. In reality the son is a professional boxer and the daughter a cabaret dancer. (How difficult it is to invent excuses for dragging the inevitable prizering and cabaret scenes into the up-to-date film!) Sir Harry is grievously disappointed at first, but eventually forgives his peccant children.

Wonder what the harvest was twenty years ago?And, in a section shot in China, in and around Peiping, the red flag-waving, while probably quite authentic, is chauvinistic to the point of being crude. Thousands of what are obviously coolie laborers hand build a giant earthen dam, while the glories of a \\"people's project\\" are happily and musically extolled.There are bits of this big conglomeration that are wonderful, withal—close shots of clanging troikas (those racy three-horse sleds) dashing in wild confusion along a sparkling, snow-packed road; scenes of Galina Ulanova and a troupe from the Bolshoi Ballet doing several passages from Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake\\"; the Ukrainian singer, Galina Oleinichenko, giving out beautifully with song, backed up by an orchestra of maybe a hundred violins, violas and harps.While the technical quality of this picture is no better than that of the last (the three panels on the giant screen lack color synchronization and the match lines still do not match), the over-all effects of the huge pictures are overpowering, as Cinerama and CineMiracle are.And we found the last line quite amusing: \\"The real fairy tale is still to come.\\" Screen: Soviet Fantasy; Second Kinopanorama Film at the Mayfair"},{"year":"1955","title":"HONG KONG, May 21--Recent developments have created the impression here that there is less danger now of an immediate Chinese Communist attack against the Nationalist-held offshore islands than was the case a few months ago.

For nearly three-quarters of a century, the Pierpont Morgan Library's rare books, manuscripts, drawings and other precious objects have been among New York City's least accessible treasures, going on view only as the library's limited exhibition spaces allowed.    Under the leadership of its former director, Charles Ryskamp, the institution began an ambitious and rewarding program of loan exhibitions that has continued to this day. But when those exhibitions went up, what was on view of the permanent collection often had to come down. There was not space for both at the same time. To a number of people, in and out of the library, it was just as well that the place remained a sanctuary for scholarship and research","excerpt":"but for many others, visitors to the city and residents alike, a journey to the Morgan spelled disappointment.    So in 1988, when the library undertook a $30 million expansion under Mr. Ryskamp's successor, Charles Pierce Jr., it seemed possible that the institution might finally be able to keep a more generous portion of its holdings on display. (For conservation reasons, it can never keep drawings and manuscripts on view for long periods.)    That expansion is now complete, and the renovated library does turn out to be a more outgoing and commodious place. But not dramatically so. The new Morgan is more of a museum without being less of a library.    A cul-de-sac where the bookstore used to be has been restored to its first function as a gallery, and the bookstore has been moved across a new skylighted courtyard to one of the buildings that the library has bought in its expansion. A modest gallery has been constructed just beside the courtyard. Display cases devoted to the library's collections of manuscripts and rare books have been set up in what was J. P. Morgan's own library, one of the grand rooms in the city. The banker's former study, with its collection of Renaissance paintings and decorative objects, has been opened to visitors, who previously were permitted only to peer through the doorway.    No big, fancy galleries have been added, no major changes made to the original buildings. Yet the redesign provides adequate space for displays of the permanent collection while preserving the main exhibition hall at the entrance to the library for temporary shows, like the one of Mozart manuscripts and letters that was on view before the Morgan closed in August.    To celebrate its expansion, and to demonstrate the nature of the objects that can now go on regular display, the library has installed \\"Masterpieces,\\" through Jan. 5, a selection of more than 275 manuscripts, printed books, drawings and other works from the collection. This is one of the few times that a show of greatest hits makes sense.    At Pierpont Morgan's death in 1913, the Burlington Magazine observed, \\"What he recognized in an object was primarily its importance, the part it had played in the evolution of civilization.\\" When he decided to buy autograph manuscripts and letters, for instance, he set his sights on the writings of Lincoln, Washington, Milton, Thoreau, Ruskin, Keats, Pope and Goethe. One story has it that he went so far as to post an agent in Greece for years with the sole task of buying every Byron manuscript that came onto the market.    Pierpont Morgan was such a voracious collector that by the end of his life his holdings accounted for nearly half his fortune. The collection, wrote Ron Chernow in \\"The House of Morgan,\\" \\"was founded in an impulse that paralleled his banking ambition -- to put America on a par with the European civilization he so admired. As in banking, he honored Old World traditions even as he ransacked them.\\"    His son, J. P. Morgan Jr., was no less aggressive and successful an acquisitor, and by his death, in 1943, the library had assumed the scale of a major institution with assortments of manuscripts, printed books, drawings and book bindings to rival the great collections of Europe. When Dannie and Hettie Heineman decided in 1962 to donate their collections of books, autograph scores and letters, the Morgan Library was a natural place for them to turn. When in 1973 the cellist Janos Scholz announced he would give away the 1,500 Italian Old Master drawings he had acquired, or more recently when Eugene and Clare Thaw agreed to bequeath to the Morgan their outstanding collection of 19th-century French drawings, they were playing to a strong suit. And in almost single-handedly transforming the library through her donations into the country's premier repository of autograph musical manuscipts, Mary Flagler Cary knew she was enhancing a small but significant collection that already included a score in Beethoven's hand and Mozart's earliest letters.    On view in this exhibition are not only the Beethoven score of a violin sonata, which Pierpont Morgan bought in 1912, but also the Polonaise in A flat, Op. 53, in Chopin's meticulous hand, which came from the Heineman collection, and the libretto for Aida with annotations by Verdi, from the Cary collection.    To look at an autograph manuscript is to feel, rightly or wrongly, that a door to the musician's or writer's psyche has been unlocked. The library has accumulated an important assortment of artists' letters. There are in the show letters with drawings by Piranesi and Ruskin and a receipt from Picasso to the art dealer Paul Rosenberg, with a sketch by the artist of a painting that Rosenberg had just bought. A spicy note from Seurat, displayed just beside the Picasso letter, admonishes the critic Felix Feneon for neglecting to mention Seurat by name in a monograph on the origins of Neo-Impressionist color theory. What the great Seurat exhibition now at the Metropolitan does not make explicit about the painter's prickly personality, the Morgan's letter does.    A manuscript of \\"Don Juan,\\" in which the text is written both down and across the same page, suggests the speed at which Byron's ideas tumbled forth in virtually complete and final form; with Balzac, the creative process was as much a matter of endless second-guessing, as is apparent from the galley proofs of \\"Eugenie Grandet,\\" which have been emended to within an inch of their life and beyond the point of legibility.    It is in the areas of Old Master drawings, printed books and illuminated manuscripts that the Morgan has earned its reputation with the widest public. The collection is full of firsts. On display are the earliest datable example of printing in Europe, the first surviving book printed in Italy, the first in France, the first in Bruges, the first surviving book printed in English, the first dated book printed in Spain, the only surviving complete copy of \\"Le Morte d'Arthur.\\"    What are unquestionably the most beautiful printed copies of works by St. Augustine, Plutarch and Aristotle also belong to the Morgan: from late-15th-century Venice, they are illustrated with trompe-l'oeil paintings by the Lombard illuminator Girolamo da Cremona.    With the drawings, the show brings out many of the collection's standardbearers and some of its finest acquisitions of the last few decades, from Bernini, Filippino Lippi and Rubens to Poussin, Ingres and Watteau. And no manuscript more succinctly sums up Pierpont Morgan's regal taste than the illumination from around 1230 in which Blanche of Castile is shown instructing her son, King Louis IX of France, a work presumably commissioned by the Queen herself.    There are manuscripts from 10th-century Spain that mix influences of North Africa, France and the Orient, and point the way toward Miro and Matisse. There are illuminations that recall the bold, colorful stained-glass designs and murals of Ste.-Chapelle and may in fact have been painted by the artisans who did those. Simon Bening's illustrations for the Da Costa Hours are as sweet and refined, and Don Guilio Clovio's illustrations for the Farnese Hours as spectacular and over the edge as any paintings of the 16th century, big or small.    The Morgan's collection has always been as eccentric as its founder, and it has remained so decades after his death, now encompassing children's books and Gilbert and Sullivan memorabilia and manuscripts to add to the ancient seals and other curios that Morgan acquired. They are all in \\"Masterpieces,\\" in representative numbers and of the highest quality.

We then flew Ryanair on to Milan. The fare was only about $70, but we had to pay $240 for excess baggage! Is there a clever way to get our baggage back to Brussels for our return flight? -- Jane and Stuart Bowyer, San Francisco       Your plight is shared by several readers, writing in response to the question on overweight baggage on Feb. 5, who have suggested that shipping luggage can be a cost-effective way to avoid punitive excess baggage charges, not just within Europe but between Europe and the United States , and indeed throughout the world.

On the surface, this may seem obvious - it shouldn't be surprising that Russian music sounds peculiarly Russian. But think about it in more global terms: In Germany and France, for instance, musical language has changed so radically that mid-20th-century German and French works have precious little in common with their late 19th-century predecessors. With Russian music, by contrast, once you look beyond certain superficial harmonic developments, you can't help but notice that the qualities that make Shostakovich's music sound Russian are the same as those that make Tchaikovsky's sound Russian.   Allan Kozinn writes frequently about music and musicians.  Those characteristics include melodies etched in minor keys, often with a modal touch, and usually brimming with an irresistibly fluid lyricism; rhythms that are sometimes plodding caricatures, and sometimes insistently propulsive; a penchant for using the full palette of orchestral colors; and in many cases, a cutting, parodistic edge. Quite often, these elements are marshalled in the service of a seemingly pervasive desire to achieve a pictorial kind of expression.

In it Dorothy Mackaill appears as Gita Cartaret, a girl who backs up her hatred, of men with a pistol. The reason for her aversion to the opposite sex is due to her father's cruel treatment of her mother when Gita was a child.The character gives Miss Mackaill an opportunity to appear in a variety of mannish costumes. Gita has long skirts with twin pockets, coats and white waistcoats. Instead of adorning herself with feminine finery for a dance, Gita appears in a black coat and skirt, a white waistcoat, a wing collar and a bow tie, not to mention a white carnation and a long cigarette holder. When she is introduced to a man she extends her hand and stands up. She even adopts a masculine method of speech and if perchance she is not puffing on a cigarette, she keeps her hands in the pockets of her skirt.Unfortunately for Gita, a Mrs. Pleyden, who is responsible for Gita's well-being, declares that Gita must either consent to have a chaperon o??? get married. This is brought about through Gita having formed a platonic friendship for Eustace Bylant, a novelist, who, aside from finding excellent material in Gita, suddenly discovers he has been unwittingly ensuared by Gita's charm.Gita is described as a creature who pretends before a crowd, but who before her mirror is herself. One of her feminine friends suggests that as Gita wants to look so thoroughly masculine she had better cut her eyelashes short","excerpt":"but Gita likes her long-lashed eyes and she has no idea whatever of clipping them.Gita is eventually introduced as Bylant's wife. She goes through the formality of a marriage ceremony to avoid being watched by a chaperon. Bylant is given to understand by Gita, before the wedding, that they are to occupy separate apartments in his house.The other man in the case is Geoffrey Pleyden, a young physician, who having once seen Gita in dainty diaphanous attire falls in love with her. Needless to say Gita is not seen in mannish clothes in the last chapter of this film.Miss Mackaill is quite charming as Gita, but the more serious phases of the picture seem a little beyond her. Jack Mulhall is satisfactory as Geoffrey Pleyden and Rockliffe Fellowes is capital as Bylant.

Of course, given their chosen style of aggressive free improvisation, things might have turned out much the same even without a theme. Mr. Ullmann, a prominent figure on the Berlin avant-garde scene, has a tirelessly interrogatory approach to improvisation, as he has proven on recent albums. (His latest is a bare-bones trio recording, ''Cutitout,'' on Leo Records.) Mr. Swell is more of a blusterer, after the exuberant tradition of Roswell Rudd","excerpt":"but he also puts clear thought into his compositions and ensemble organization. (His band Slammin' the Infinite has a new release, ''Remember Now,'' on the Not Two label.) The band now known as the Ullmann/Swell 4 will be touring Europe for the first time this fall, but first it has a few dates in New York. No two performances will be alike, though it's safe to assume that certain qualities, including a sort of scorched-earth intensity, should carry over from one to the next.

Frequent close-ups of two persons discussing love or arguing about other matters do not help this picture, as one gets tired of seeing blinking eyes, worried looks, shaking heads and the heroine's smiles, when such expressions are not accompanied by action.While the three principals are at their ease in acting before the camera, George Archainbaud's direction often makes these players look awkward and theatric. Mary Astor impersonates Leonore Bewlay, and to show that this charming person is filled with the joie de vivre, Mr. Archainbaud pictures her in a constant state of hilarity.Mr. Archainbaud introduces an old innkeeper in the Swiss Alps. This character has a long pipe which the director does not let him put down. Occasionally the innkeeper uses the stem to tickle his head—to denote wonder and curiosity. This seems to be quite natural, but when the plump person brings up a tray with a meal to the mountain clinmbers, one does feel that his pipe, still clenched between his teeth, should have been left in the kitchen.Mr. Archainbaud has some good ideas, but like many other directors, he pictures them in haste and loses much effect that might be gained by pondering over these scenes and dwelling upon each little detail.Leo—as the heroine is familiarly known—who had been in service during the war, has learned to scorn conventionalities. She goes to Switzerland with Richard Valryan, an American opera singer, who is married","excerpt":"but he and his wife have agreed to disagree. Yet we are asked to think of the friendship of Valryan and Leo as platonic. Leo, it is true, is also accompanied by an older woman, but when the heroine goes for a long mountain climb, she and Valryan are alone. This, of course, leads to suspicion, which is reported in England, after Leo is married to Henry Wallis (Clive Brook) and causes bickering and squabbling.In the course of this story Leo goes to a small town in Lancashire, where the mid-Victorians look askance at her bathing suit, especially when she rides a horse through the surf. The English women turn down their mouths as they whisper among themselves that she is a \\"Yankee.\\" As a matter of fact Leo is so pretty that she never could be the cause of such a discussion, as one would feel quite honored by her presence. There is a little English boy in Eton clothes, who is unkind to Leo's Pekinese, with the result that the boy gets his ears boxed. This is straining the point. The attempt to picture an English Bishop shows only a vague idea of his attire.Mr. Brook is pleasing most of the time, and Ian Keith, making allowances for the direction, is decidedly sympathetic, although he rather overdoes the artist's collor. Miss Astor is beautiful, but her acting is not nearly as good as it was in \\"Oh, Doctor.\\" THE SCREEN; Love Discussions."},{"year":"1923","title":"I Zangwill lectures before N Y section YOUNG VAIL SENTENCED TO PRISON IN CAPRI","excerpt":"But He and His Wife, Formerly Miss Guggenheim, Are Allowed to Leave After Appeal."},{"year":"1929","title":"Hard court championships TILDEN TRIUMPHS IN FRENCH DOUBLES","excerpt":"But He and Hunter Have Hard Time Beating Coen and Borotra's Young Brother.MATCH GOES FOUR SETSCoen Plays Brilliant Game and Then Wins With Miss Cross--Miss Wills Easy Victor.

The students are neatly introduced and the segments bridged by photo sessions, apparently for the class yearbook.   The pace is fast, the glimpses brief, yet the feelings seem honest, and personalities come through. The first sight of Tim, who is about to become a father, finds him soaping up his car.

The viewer can deduce that fatherhood, with all its implications, may simply seem more than he can handle.   Each of the first few episodes has its highs and lows, in crowd scenes or in quiet conversations. One future program catches reactions to the start of the war in the Persian Gulf, through a gung-ho boy who plans to join the Marine Corps and a girl who is worried about her boyfriend in the Army.      Youthful spirits and vulnerabilities make themselves felt in lunchroom confidences and locker-room pump-ups and letdowns, a pep rally and a talent show, the noisy halls and the ever-present music. The contest for homecoming queen, so open to mockery, is presented straight; the pretty young candidates' craving to win yet be good sports about losing is touching. There is not much about schoolwork -- perhaps, let's hope, only because studying does not make for exciting television. Teachers and parents make sympathetic appearances.   These are thin slices of life, but the promise of the series is that the vignettes, in which new faces appear and others reappear, will develop into a montage that is more than its parts. After tonight's opener, which the network hopes will pick up some of the big \\"Simpsons\\" audience, \\"Yearbook\\" takes its regular place in the Channel 5 schedule at 8:30 P.M. Saturdays, when you can meet a quarterback who hopes to make it to the Ivy League, a potential dropout, a female hockey goalie, a scholarship winner.    So far, everybody is likable, and most of these high-schoolers seem to be suprisingly aware of their own particular kinds of immaturity. There is always the danger that the producers will go in for soap opera elements, but in the early sample, they seem to be resisting exploitation or condescension. As adults often tell youngsters, the future looks hopeful.    Yearbook  Produced by Hank O'Karma for New Screen Concepts; Louis H. Gorfain and Charles A. Bangert, executive producers.

This unobtrusive American is one of the most important figures in the international film world, not any the less powerful because he keeps himself consistently in the background. He came to Germany several years ago and organized the big German talker trust, which combined the patents of Tobis-Klangfilm and Küchenmeister and then fought their battles with the American sound patent holders. The agreement between Western Electric and the Germans, which made it possible for American films to be shown in Germany and vice versa, is largely his work. Now he is one of the directors of the German sound trust and applying American business methods to its organization.He has just returned from a lengthy stay in New York and announces that he has already organized a chain of approximately thirty theatres, which will play films with German dialogue. The number of these houses is shortly to be extended to between 100 and 200. This will give German producers a very satisfactory turnover from America alone.Films for America.Mr. Diamond warns very strongly against the showing of every German pioture in America. Just as in the United States, the average film here is solely of local interest, produced cheaply to fulfill a special need. If these pictures are shown in America they will be judged by much too high a standard and the whole German production condemned on their account. Only the exceptional film should find its way to us and there are enough of these being produced in Germany to keep this small group of houses comfortably supplied.In his talk with THE TIMES correspondent Mr. Diamond went on to defend the German sound trust. This organization has often been accused of taking too high royalties on their patents and thereby making production difficult in Germany. Mr. Diamond believes that American producers should make their German versions in Berlin, not in Hollywood, for they will then not only be cheaper but considerably more accurate in detail and better suited to German taste. Also, competition is just what the German film industry needs and will lead to a raising of all standards. This open market should not be hemmed in in any way and Mr. Diamond is therefore of the opinion that the system of governmental import permits should be considerably revised so that American directors and stars can be used over here without bringing the films under the classification of foreign product.Herr Siodmak.ROBERT SIODMAK belongs to what they call here, in their best German, the \\"avant-garde\\" school of picture directors. A little over a year ago he took some young people and a film camera and made a picture of Berlin outdoor life","excerpt":"but he could find no one to show it. At last it was used as a stop-gap, and the press, which always supports such enterprises, giving it a hearty boost, it ran along merrily for several weeks on Kurfürstendamm, the amusement street of the metropolis.So the Ufa engaged Siodmak at the beginning of the year and he turned out a satisfactory little film which treated a typical Berlin boarding house. Now under Erich Pommer's supervision his last work, \\"Der Mann der seinen Mörder sucht\\" (\\"Looking for His Murderer\\") keeps the note of originality which distinguished his former films, but is at the same time considerably more workmanlike. It makes a satisfactory compromise between what the few and what almost everybody likes. Siodmak calls it a \\"Groteske,\\" which means that it has the fantastic idiocy of a Harold Lloyd comedy but yet maintains a certain satirical contact with reality.Its leading figure is a youth who has decided to commit suicide because he finds life vacant. But he simply cannot get enough spunk to pull a trigger. A burglar enters his apartment and threatens to shoot him, but refrains when he realizes that this is just what the young man really wants. But he signs a contrast with him agreeing to kill him within twenty-four hours in return for an order on his life insurance. Then begins a series of mad adventures—the crook following him but never quite succeeding in finishing him—off. Of course, a girl makes her appearance and for her sake the youth decides that life is sweet again end tries to buy back his contract from the crook. But this weak-kneed individual has already sold it to a famous gunman, and chance brings the youth in very close contact with the individual—indeed, they share a cell and make a getaway from jail together.An American's Influence.I do not know just how Germany is going to take the film, as I imagine it is a trifle too \\"grotesque\\" for them. But the influence of the American, Carl Winston, who helped with the direction, made it just right for the intelligent American taste—all the more so as Heinz Rühmann, who is playing the leading rôle, is a comedian with international possibilities, or, I should rather say, international certainties. His delectable light staccato way of speaking which suggests a stutter without actually being one should translate itself well into Anglo-Saxon.Another picture with an artistic conscience was \\"Drel Tage Liebe' (Three Days of Love), which had its première at the Gloria Palast. This is a very commendable example of the film which treats of the life of the great employed—treats it sincerely, not merely as something for the hero or heroine to leave behind them in their upward career. A servant maid and a furniture mover are the figures which Joe Lederer has treated in his scenario. The girl spends three days of happiness with the youth and they are planning to be married. But his former sweet heart puts into her head the idea that she is not sufficiently well dressed to hold him and so she steals a ring to get money to make herself attractive. When he finds out what she has done, in his first reaction of rage he sends her away. He soon repents, however, but cannot find her. The girl goes wandering through the streets and finally finds two men who give her the money to make good her theft. But she is in a hysterical state and, believing herself followed by the police, throws herself down a shaft. Not exactly typical of everyday life, but so faithful in atmosphere and characterization as to deserve judgment on a very high level.Ability Counts.The direction of Heinz Hilpert again prove that a first-class stage director is competent to turn out a fine talker even though he has had no experience with films. Hilpert, who is one of the best producers of the Reinhardt theatres, not only directed this picture as a novice in screen technique, but even wrote the working script himself, a technical job usually turned over to experts. And how beautifully he handles his actors. The action of the film does not exactly race, but he knows how to fill it in with characteristic gesture and facial expression. There is hardly a dead moment. Of course he had, in Hans Albers, who played the male lead, an actor of very extraordinary qualities. His comedy sits deep and is beautifully timed and his serious scenes are almost equally effective. The picture's negative quantity is Käthe Dorsch, who is costarred with him. On the stage she deserves to be up in lights, her gayety rings completely true and her emotion catches at us. But on the screen she seems uneasy and artificial, the microphone catches only a small part of her vocal individuality and before the camera her face seems flat and expressionless. Käthe Dorsch is one of the stage actresses who cannot express herself in the talker.

Theodore Roberts gives us a pretty faithful idea of \\"Grumpy\\"","excerpt":"but he falls short of the wonderful stage characterization of Cyril Maude. The picture, in fact, gives some impression of having been made in a hurry. That one of the characters is wearing a wig is rather obvious; another suggestion of haste is the casting of young Casson Ferguson as Chamberlin Jarvis, the man who would take a life for a big enough diamond. Mr. Ferguson, with every threat and in answering accusations, insists on making grimaces that cause one to wonder why everybody is not on to the fact that it was he who knocked out Ernest Herron (Conrad Nagel) and purloined the big diamond. Mr. Ferguson practically radios his guilt to everybody but they will not look at his face for fear that they would have to end the story before Mr. de Mille wishes. This young \\"villain\\" has all the tricks of the tragedian of yesteryear, and none of the subtlety of the modern, successful crook, usually so much in demand for the screen.Of course the whole picture, like the play, is woven around \\"Grumpy,\\" and Mr. Roberts keeps up interest in the role, searching for the right gardenia around which a woman's hair is wound, and which Ferguson has plucked from Nagel in mistake for the gardenia he himself had been wearing. \\"Grumpy,\\" always careful to wear his shawl—a nuisance to Mr. Roberts—hurries to London, where, after sleuthing around, he is attacked by Ferguson's butler for taking a letter from that menial's pocket. Mr. Roberts as \\"Grumpy\\" puts up a remarkable fight, which the game old sport takes as if it were all in the day's work. When Ferguson is tempted to return to \\"Grumpy's\\" home, he gets the reception wanted for him by everybody in the theatre—Scotland Yard sleuths and \\"Grumpy.\\" It is the wrinkled and bent old man, however, who suggests looking for the diamond in Ferguson's shoe. It is \\"Grumpy\\" also who quickly admonishes the detective to take the one Ferguson has not offered. Here we have \\"Ferguson discovered,\\" with one eyebrow up and the other down. He gives up the shoe. A search with the huge magnifying glass \\"Grumpy\\" always carries with him reveals—glue! A touch with the finger nail, then with a pen knife, and the top of the shoe heel cover slides round, disclosing the lost diamond. The jig is up for Chamberlin Jarvis (Ferguson), so proud, so well barbered, so smugly satisfied only a few hours before.In spite of the diluted villainy, it is a picture well worth seeing. It is amusing, even when the crook is on the stage. May McAvoy, as the gullible young lady who has a penchant for Jarvis, is quite good and very pretty.

This film adventure is based on Anne Nichols's play, \\"Just Married,\\" and it is saved chiefly by the diligent manner in which at least two of the characters disregard the Eighteenth Amendment. What with the hiccups and staggering of the night before and the headaches and mishaps of the morning after, the audience yesterday afternoon was frequently stirred to loud laughter.The two bibulous characters, who have evidently resolved that leaving Paris sober isn't done, are played by James Hall and Harrison Ford. The losing of a pair of trousers is an important event in this yarn. It gives Mr. Hall a chance to run around for most of the picture at an evident disadvantage. Miss Taylor figures as Roberta Adams and Mr. Hall is seen as Robert Adams. The similarity of the names aboard an Atlantic steamshhip creates many a contretemps. Roberta awakens the morning after the vessel leaves Cherbourg, believing that the other bed in her stateroom is occupied by an aged and unprepossessing aunt, whereas Mr. Robert Adams finally shows his heavy head above the quilt. The sight of Mr. Adams's evidently masculine physiognomy startles the fair Miss Adams, and as the ship plows its way through the billows the awkward predicaments constantly increase. Jack Stanley (Mr. Ford) chances to be on his honeymoon, but when he leaves his bride for a few moments in his anxiety to look for his companion in crime. Mr. Adams, he invariably plunges into the wrong state-room and has a difficult time, both explaining to his wife and the persons he disturbs.Mr. Adams, during his inebriated hours, is loath to be separated from Mr. Stanley, and he is therefore seen actually falling into the Stanley stateroom after having knocked on the door. Mr. Stanley, whose movements are anything but steady, succeeds in showing Mr. Adams the way out, but soon after a knock is heard. Again Mr. Stanley opens the door and sees the grinning countenance of his intoxicated pal, who once more falls flat on his face across the threshold.Mr. Adams's flighty experiences result, of course, in Miss Adams falling in love with him. Percy Jones, whom she was going to marry, is jilted","excerpt":"but he has a skeleton in his closet, or a dark-haired Parisian, who refers to him as \\"my man\\" and \\"zat apache,\\" so one is not really tearfully sorry for him.Mr. Hall gives quite a vivid and absurdly humorous impression of a young man trying to drink a French town dry. Mr. Ford is equally mirthful through his stoicism when under the influence of whatever these two found to drink. Miss Taylor is pretty and she has evidently been most careful in her selection of pajamas and gowns. William Austin is amusing, but he never seems to be saying what one reads in the subtitles.

The producer, F. Ozep, reveals a remarkable aptitude for using the camera to tell a story.This drab chronicle of wholesome love and evil passion is chiefly interesting from the viewpoint of some of the characterizations and the skilled and imaginative direction. The two unfortunate peasants, man and wife, however, go through a frightfully agonizing ordeal apparently only to satisfy the whim of a Baron's daughter and her husband.Mr. Ozep has enriched this production with a number of truly beautiful, and at times poetic, scenic effects. When he wishes to pass over months he depicts the change from one season to another by the aspect of the terrain and the foliage of the trees. To denote the tempest in the lives of two of his characters he turns to the skies and shows threatening clouds gradually covering the patches of blue. Then sometimes his workers are silhouetted against the dying day. There is the joy of life, the blighted hopes, the separation and latterly the horrible suspicion of Jacob, the peasant husband.During most of this pictorial narrative one expects that the outcome will be bullets and bloodshed. But such is not the case, for it has a relatively happy ending, for the tyrannized Jacob and his wife, Marie, are reunited but worse off than they were at the beginning of the drama.This film bears but little resemblance to the play, \\"The Yellow Ticket,\\" which was presented here at the Eltinge Theatre in January, 1914, with a cast that included John Barrymore, Emmett Corrigan, Elaine Inescort, David Torrence and Julian Rolfe. The yellow ticket is virtually the only feature that is reminiscent of the play. This bit of pasteboard is the legal permit of a wanton.At the outset of this film, Jacob, a low-browed son of the soil, comes back from the war. His joy is great at seeing Marie, and soon Jacob goes to the landowner, the Baron, to ask him to rent an acre or so of land. The Baron, because it is his daughter's wedding day, complies with the request of the two peasants","excerpt":"but he is a hog and therefore tells them they can have part of the land in the valley. There, as Jacob and Marie know, it is covered with boulders and stones. They accept the land and toil during the daylight hours trying to clean up the land and make it fruitful. These stretches are filled with pathos, for the futility of the task is ably portrayed by the producer. Mr. Ozep, after introducing the Baron, turns his camera on the landscape, depicting the vast area owned by the mighty, callous personage.Eventually Marie is impelled to leave her husband, not because she wants to, but because the Baron threatened to turn them out of their tiny shack if Marie does not go to serve his daughter as a nurse.Jacob is able to write, but Marie can't even read. So she entrusts the reading of her husband's missives to the malignant Baron's daughter, who informs Marie that Jacob writes that everything is well, whereas he has written of his disappointments.The husband of the Baron's daughter forces his attentions on Marie and she is eventually seen in the man's room by the doorman of the building. This man, who has a tongue of scandal, when Jacob comes to the city with his one remaining child, poisons the peasant's mind concerning Marie.The yellow ticket is brought into the drama when Marie, after escaping from her employes, is arrested by the police and eventually given the woeful passport. It pleases her at the time, for she does not know what it means.After further misfortunes, Marie and Jacob are brought together, glad to fold their arms around each other in spite of everything.Anna Sten is remarkably true to life in her portrayal of the peasant wife. I. I. Koval Samborski is a rugged type, and very sound in his impersonation of Jacob. M. Markoff is impressive as the tyrannical Baron. V. P. Fogel gives a fine character stuoy of the sensuous villain. Annel Sudakevich in many scenes overdoes the selfish and lying Baron's daughter.

Although the sentimental strain is employed somewhat too freely toward the end, the producers are to be congratulated for permitting this feature to come to a logical conclusion.In this compelling film Mr. Jannings's individual work excels any of his other screen contributions, for while there is an obvious desire to wring tears from the audiences in the latter episodes this remarkable German actor never falters in his delineation of the character August Schiller. At the time the story opens (some twenty years ago) Mr. Schiller is seen as the cashier of a Milwaukee bank who is the happy father of six children. This thickly bearded Mr. Schiller lives a wholesome existence. He arises at 7 and even on those occasions when he exhibits his skill on a bowling alley he is careful not to drink more than his habitual couple of glasses of beer and to return home in good time.The nature of this bank cashier is pictured most vividly. He is a soft hearted father, even more kindly than his wife in the treatment of the children. He is just a wee bit of a sycophant when faced by his superiors and he is a little too zealous in watching the clerks under him.In the initial sequence Mr. Schiller is perceived being awakened by his alarm clock. You realize that he sleeps soundly, but once he has looked at himself in the mirror and stretched himself, his face is crossed with a smile, which broadens when he goes into the room occupied by his children, to whom he is thoroughly devoted. He wears a nightgown, and so do the three boys and the three little girls. Once he has aroused them, they go through their daily dozen, and nothing could be more delightful than the sight of these youngsters, hardly awake, doing their best to imitate their father in the exercises.No detail, either in furnishings or clothes, has been overlooked. It reflects the characteristics of the man who after twenty years' service in the bank felt that as cashier he had attained a position of importance. He is therefore thoroughly satisfied with his lot in life. He is depicted at the breakfast table at exactly 7:30 o'clock, and one realizes that this daily routine never varies. You see the youngest girl spill the milk, and when the mother is exasperated, it is the father who smoothes matters over and brings the child a drinking bottle. One of the boys then breaks a sugar basin, and Schiller, to pacify his wife, takes his son into another room and proceeds to put the lad across his knees and then to swing the strap on a table so that it sounds as if the youngster were having a sound thrashing. Then Schiller kisses the boy.Imagine, then, this jovial soul suddenly told one night late by the bank officials that he must leave for Chicago to dispose of some unlisted securities. He consents reluctantly to go. To him it is evidently a bother, for his daily schedule will be interrupted for some time. On the train it just happens that the section he thought he had to himself is occupied by a young woman who has obviously tried to outdo nature in making herself attractive.At first this fast young person is rather peeved at Mr. Schiller's intrusion and he is not exactly overwhelmed with joy to find that she has the seat facing him. He buries himself in his newspaper and when he crosses his legs the peroxide blond smiles disdainfully at his thick, white woolen socks. However, when the conductor comes by, Mr. Schiller forgets where he has put his ticket and, in his search, the blond becomes quite interested in the flash she gets of the $1,000 securities.You may argue that Mr. Schiller is unnaturally susceptible to the blond's smile and that he is very weak when he consents to buy a bottle of champagne on the train for the scheming female","excerpt":"but he is out of his element, a man going away to a place where he is unknown. He is unaccustomed to wine and the realization that what he does will not be discovered causes him to be still more careless and to indulge freely in the insidious beverage until at last, Mayme, young woman, prevails upon him to get his beard shaved off.Then follow scenes of reckless gayety which culminate in a visit to a saloon run by a crook. The next morning the reputable August Schiller awakens to discover himself in a wretched bedroom. He searches in his pockets and first discovers that he has been robbed of the securities and then that he has had his beard shorn. After ascertaining where he can perhaps find Mayme, he goes to the place, and there tries pleading with her and then endeavors to intimidate her. Eventually the proprietor of the saloon hits Schiller on the head with a chair and he is carried out unconscious and put on the railroad tracks. The crook then decides to strip Schiller of everything that might lead to his identification, but while doing so Schiller recovers consciousness and in the course of a struggle the crook is thrown in front of an oncoming train. Hence because the body is badly mangled it is believed that Schiller has been robbed and killed, and Schiller, after deciding to end his life, discovers through a newspaper that he's supposed to be dead.So Schiller is perceived struggling along through life, latterly employed as a man who picks up paper in a park. He is wrinkled and aged; his hair is thick and matted and his steps are halting.Toward the close there is an ironical situation, wherein Schiller walks behind his wife and children. They go to a cemetery and put wreaths on two graves—one of the graves is supposed to be that of Schiller and the other is that of his eldest son, who fell in the World War.Whether it is fear of what might happen to him, the disgrace attached to his wild night or the desire to be remembered as he was, need not be explained. Following other scenes during a Christmas snowstorm, the bent and bowed Schiller walks off from a glimpse of his own home, knowing that his son, whom he had assisted in teaching the violin, had scored a success with that musical instrument. And in Schiller's pocket is a dollar given to him by that son, who, of course, does not recognize in the supposed tramp the figure of his once vigorous father.Belle Bennett as Mrs. Schiller gives a capital portrayal. Phyllis Haver figures as Mayme, whom she makes much too flashy and too obviously a woman of the underworld. This picture was directed by Victor Fleming, who, with Perley Poore Sheehan, the author of the story; Lajos Biros and Jules Furthman, the adapters, deserve to share in the credit with Mr. Jannings.

The most interesting parts are the views of the salmon and the method of handling them, and these looked suspiciously as though they had been clipped from a convenient news reel.

Through that year I wound up the final editing of a new novel -- my 11th book, 10th volume of fiction, 8th novel -- with the terminal-sounding title, \\"The Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor.\\" It is a comedy whose dark muse is, in fact, that figure called by Scheherazade \\"the Destroyer of Delights\\": lethal Time. Near midyear I turned 60 and, per personal program, retired on that birthday from my full-time professorship at Johns Hopkins University -- \\"early-early phased retirement\\" by the university's standards and in the language of its benefits administration office","excerpt":"but I had been teaching for nearly 40 years, the last 17 of them at my alma mater. I swapped my endowed chair for emeritus rank and reduced my academic responsibilities to one graduate-level fiction-writing seminar, fall semester only -- this out of my attachment to university life and the pleasures of coaching a small group of selected advanced apprentices. Romancing the Muse: Just Wait, and She'll Come Sidling Up"},{"year":"1996","title":"I had stood, all eagerness and impatience, while my sister's old evening dress was pinned on me before that fateful dance at the yacht club. I didn't even know enough to look critically at the mirror and see that the strapless gown didn't suit me, especially after the dark brown velvet straps had been added to keep the dress up on my flat chest. I placed no value on looks. Having  not had this rite of passage explained to me, I hadn't a clue that beauty was the prerequisite to adolescent stardom. Certainly, this new longing for boys had made me awkward in their presence","excerpt":"but I had noticed that they were awkward, too. Accustomed to being chosen first for any team of girls, I didn't question success that night, couldn't remember failure, so carefully had I buried nursery angers under trophies of recent accomplishments. I'm sure I was prepared to solve any hesitancy the boys might have in approaching us girls by taking the initiative myself. Assuming responsibility was who I was. In recent years my life had been a great adventure, in which there had been no comparisons made to  my mother and sister. In my mind, they were boring in their tedious arguing over my sister's looks and her evenings with boys. \\n\\n     That night at the yacht club marked the end of childhood, the finish of that  adventure story with me as heroine. In one momentous night I took it all in and  made my concession speech to myself. I watched my friends, whose leader I had been for years, watched them happy in the arms of desirable boys, and I recognized what they had that I lacked; saw it so clearly that I can recreate the film today, frame by frame: they had a look I lacked that went beyond beauty. It wasn't curls, breasts, prettiness, but a quality of acquiescence: the agreeable offer to be led instead of to lead. My own face was too eager, too open, too sure of itself. I needed a mask. I needed a new face that belied the intelligent leader inside and portrayed the little girl, no, the tiny, helpless  baby who hadn't been held enough in the first years of life and had been waiting all these years for boys now to care for her. LIVES;The Age of Beauty"},{"year":"1985","title":"Some years ago, one rainy day in Copenhagen, I went to see a Woody Allen movie, in English with Danish subtitles. Though it was midafternoon the theater was fairly full","excerpt":"but I had the unnerving experience of being the only one in the large house who laughed (and I laughed a lot). Either the creator of the titles had missed the humor or the Danes were just being melancholy. Some years before, I had had the same experience in reverse, seeing a comic play in Shiraz. The Iranian audience rocked with laughter while I, knowing no Farsi, sat there unsmiling. But not discontent. For the true theater lover, some enjoyment can be found in any performance: in the bravura of the acting (which you can follow without any distraction by the text), in the alien body language, even in the sometimes unpredictable reactions of the audience.   More than a theater lover, I am an addict. If I pass a box office, whatever is being offered - wrestling, beauty contest, free-admission TV quiz - I feel a tug. Sometimes I can resist; but more often, and especially when I am alone in a foreign country, I succumb. Thus I have seen ''Phedre'' in Serbo-Croatian, ''Pelleas et Melisande'' in Swedish, ''Kiss Me Kate'' in Czech.

W. Jenson","excerpt":"but I had trouble when he got to the fine print and to the more overriding questions of history vs. aesthetics. As for his quibbles, things began to go awry when Mr. Brenson quoted me as writing that Blake and Carstens believed oil paint to be ''a corrupt virtuoso technique fit to describe only what the eye could see and the eye could hold.'' That made no sense to me and, checking my text, I found I had written ''. . . what the eye could see and the hand could hold.'' Readers, including myself, may still be baffled by Mr. Benson's calling me to task for describing the killings of wild birds and farm animals in Millet's paintings as ''routine murder,'' which he mysteriously construes as evidence of my ''implied political and social judgments.'' (Am I stealthily preaching vegetarianism?) And I trust that other readers will be dumbfounded that he finds my text discloses how I dislike Cezanne ''to the point of loathing.'' Is that the emotion evoked by my description of a still life as ''the equivalent of a private solar system in which the seven apples, like planets, forever exist in an active state of magnetic attraction and repulsion'' or of the late 'Bathers'' as ''an overwhelming amplitude of visual order?''

After all, Ruth Ellis was real and hitherto I had only dealt, professionally at least, with figments of my imagination.\\n\\nStudying the Ruth Ellis fact sheets and photographs was an endurance test.

Mr. Stone not only misrepresents my positions but attacks and demolishes positions I do not take. Worst of all, he completely ignores the real subject of ''Beyond Power.''   He writes that I point to ''the rare matriarchal societies that have been described in myth,'' suggesting I treat these as real. In fact, I state that there is no evidence that any matriarchal society ever existed. My re-creation of a prepatriarchal period, in which mothers were central but not dominant, is based on the scholarly researches of people in many disciplines on artifacts, detectable alterations in myth and history, and the present practices of certain gathering-hunting peoples. I do not, as he claims, evade the existence of male supremacy and misery among other ''primitive'' peoples - they are discussed at some length (see pages 70-87). In refutation, Mr. Stone asserts that ''worship of a female does not do much to affect the lot of women''","excerpt":"but I make this point myself, modifying it by the suggestion that such worship indicated that a culture values qualities - like nutritiveness and compassion - that are associated with women. Mr. Stone writes that I ignore the existence of rich or powerful women who tolerated or fostered patriarchal institutions: I do not (see especially pages 156-59 and 186-88). Nor do I anywhere suggest that women are immune to power hunger or aggression or even imply that with our current morality the world would be different if women ruled it.

Your arguments appear specious: you say control of oil provides no reason for initiating military action, so long as Saddam Hussein is not allowed to manipulate the oil market.

You say collective security as a model for the future is more important than the outcome of this crisis.    Do you not completely overlook the most significant casus belli of all here: not allowing the naked aggression of one powerful country against a weaker neighbor to go unpunished?

Too awed to order by myself, I accepted suggestions of foods of which I had never heard. The first to arrive was a two-handled cup of cold, ivory-colored liquid velvet, topped with specks of jade green. It was vichyssoise, and I fell in love. Ever since, I've thought the ideal opener for a summer meal was a cold soup.   Sadly, many of the best French cold soups, like vichyssoise or madrilene, require a fair amount of hot cooking, a process that dilutes their pleasure. Spurred by laziness, a dislike of heat and my own love of the genre, I set out to devise a group of cold soups that can be made virtually without heat, in a kind of international journey of reading and remembering.   As I searched existing recipes, I omitted all but one that uses stock. I find canned broths too salty, and homemade broth -- though one of my favorite things -- takes too long to prepare and must then be chilled for cold soup, adding time-intensive labor. This led me to soups based on milk products and on fruits and vegetables.    My first stop was Malaga, south of gazpacho land on the southern Mediterranean coast of Spain. There I discovered a grape gazpacho -- no tomatoes here but a soup strong with garlic and vinegar and topped with floating, peeled and seeded grapes. Even though it met my specifications for an almost total lack of cooking, peeling grapes hardly seemed a lazy person's solution. Ever expedient, I put the grapes through a food mill, which gave me a lovely pale green, fruity liquid as the base.   If you feel like peeling some grapes for a garnish, go right ahead. I'd borrow from another version of this soup and use pieces of ripe, cut-up melon -- much less work.   All the other recipes below followed a similar route of adaptation. The peanut soup is based on African models but served cold instead of hot, which is the traditional version. This is the one soup I kept that used broth, but I ended up mixing it with milk to make it a little richer.    The spinach soup is lightly based on the many Russian cold soups made with greens. The traditional base is kvass, a lightly alcoholic brew made by fermenting beets or dark bread in water. Since it's rare in this country, I substituted beer diluted with water. The Russians have a decided taste for the acidic, which can be provided in soups by vinegar, sorrel and even chopped pickles -- surprisingly good. If good dill pickles aren't available, substitute cucumbers for crunch and increase the amounts of vinegar and salt. Since sorrel is often hard to come by, I've suggested a version made only with spinach. To compensate for the missing acidity of the sorrel, I use yogurt instead of sour cream.   Hungary offered me an illustrious tradition of cold fruit soups, though most of the recipes require cooking the fruit first. Since ripe peaches puree easily and require no cooking, a ginger-peach milk-based soup seemed the best solution. It has a surprisingly intense peach flavor and a beautiful pale-peach color. If you can find unsprayed roses of an appropriate color (pale pink would be nice), a few petals make a sensational garnish. It's a perfect introduction to a simple grilled fish.   The Moroccan seasonings in a Moroccan tomato soup make this one a recipe to cherish. If you don't have a food mill, it's almost as easy to peel and seed the tomatoes by hand. When ripe, they don't need to be blanched before peeling. Simply run the back edge of a table knife firmly over the skin of the entire tomato. This loosens the skin and makes it possible to pull it away from the flesh. Halve the tomato and squeeze gently to remove the seeds or remove them with a demitasse spoon or the handle of a coffee spoon.   Southwestern pea soup is an odd one, weirder even than the grape gazpacho but decidedly delicious. I use frozen peas to avoid cooking","excerpt":"but if you have the time to shell fresh peas -- which are so good at this time of year -- it really takes only a few minutes to steam them in a little water before pureeing.   One caveat: Most of the soups need to be made ahead so they can get very cold in the refrigerator and so the flavors have a chance to develop and combine. It's a small price, really. GRAPE GAZPACHO  4 1/2 ounces whole blanched almonds  3 tablespoons water  1 pound stemmed, seedless green grapes  2 ounces French or Italian bread, crusts removed, torn in small pieces  2 to 3 large cloves garlic, smashed and peeled  1/3 cup olive oil  2 2/3 cups ice water  3 tablespoons white wine vinegar  4 teaspoons kosher salt or to taste  Freshly ground black pepper to taste   The garnish:   4 to 5 peeled, seedless green grapes or use 1 1/2 ounces peeled and seeded honeydew melon, cut in 1/2-by- 1/4-inch pieces (a heaping 1/4 cup).    1. If using a microwave oven, place almonds and water in a 1-cup glass measure. Cover tightly with microwave plastic wrap. Cook at 100 percent power in a high-power oven for 2 minutes. Prick plastic to release steam. If using a conventional oven, place the almonds and the water in a small saucepan and cook over low heat until the almonds plump up slightly and just soften. Remove from heat; drain and set aside.   2. Pass the grapes through a food mill fitted with a medium disk placed over a bowl to catch the juice. Reserve juice and pulp.   3. Place the bread in a small bowl. Add enough of the grape juice to just cover the bread, reserving 1 cup. Lightly press down on the bread so that it absorbs the juice.   4. Place cooked almonds, soaked bread and garlic in a blender. With machine running, slowly pour in the reserved cup of grape juice. Continue blending, scraping down the sides from time to time, until the mixture is smooth.   5. With the machine still running, slowly pour in any remaining juice and the olive oil. Scrape the mixture into a large metal bowl. Stir in remaining ingredients. Refrigerate until cold. Served garnished with grapes or melon.   Yield: Four servings. PEANUT SOUP 1 cup unsalted peanuts  1 1/2 jalapeno peppers, seeded  2 tablespoons curry powder  2 cups chicken broth  1 1/3 cups lowfat milk  1 cup water  1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt  10 to 15 slivers red bell pepper, if desired, for garnish.    1. Place peanuts, jalapenos curry and 1 cup of the broth in a blender and process until smooth. Scrape down the sides. With the machine running, slowly pour in remaining broth.   2. Scrape mixture into a metal bowl. Stir in remaining ingredients, except the garnish. Refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Serve garnished with the peppers if desired.   Yield: Four servings. SPINACH SOUP  2 pounds spinach, stemmed  1/4 cup loosely packed fresh dill  1 scallion, white and light green parts trimmed and thinly sliced  1/2 pound good-quality dill pickles, cut in 1/4-inch dice (or substitute peeled and seeded cucumbers)  12 ounces beer  1/4 teaspoon peeled, freshly grated horseradish  1 1/2 cups water  Kosher salt to taste  6 bunches sorrel (about 1 1/2 pounds), stemmed and cut horizontally into 1/8-inch-wide strips (optional)  Scant 1 tablespoon unsalted butter (if adding sorrel)  1/2 cup sour cream (1 1/2 cups if adding sorrel)  1/2 cup plain yogurt (1 1/2 cups heavy cream if adding sorrel)  1 tablespoon apple-cider vinegar.    1. Wash spinach and place in a large skillet with the adhering water. Cover. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring once or twice, just until wilted. Drain. Place the spinach and the dill in a food processor and process until finely chopped.   2. Scrape mixture into a metal bowl. Stir in scallion, pickles, beer, horseradish, water and salt.    3. If using sorrel, heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat until just melted. Add the sorrel and cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until color turns. Remove from heat. Stir sorrel, 1 1/2 cups sour cream and 1 1/2 cups heavy cream into spinach mixture. If not using sorrel, stir in 1/2 cup yogurt instead of heavy cream and 1/2 cup sour cream. Refrigerate until cold. Just before serving, stir in vinegar. Add more salt if needed.   Yield: Eight servings without sorrel; twelve servings with. GINGER-PEACH SOUP  1 1/2 pounds peaches  2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice  1 1/2 cups buttermilk  2/3 cup apple juice 1/2 teaspoon peeled, freshly grated ginger  1 teaspoon honey  Scant 1 teaspoon kosher salt   The garnish for each serving:   1 aromatic geranium leaf or 1 unsprayed rose petal or 3 to 4 slices peeled, pitted peach.   1. Peel and pit the peaches, rubbing them with 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice to prevent discoloration as you work. Place peaches in a food processor and process until smooth.   2. Scrape peach puree into a medium bowl. Stir in remaining ingredients. Refrigerate until cold. Serve garnished as desired.   Yield: Four servings. MOROCCAN TOMATO SOUP  5 medium cloves garlic, smashed, peeled and minced  2 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika  1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin  Large pinch cayenne pepper  4 teaspoons olive oil  2 1/4 pounds tomatoes, cored and cut in 1-inch pieces  1/4 cup packed cilantro leaves, chopped, plus additional leaves for garnish  1 tablespoon white wine vinegar  2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  2 tablespoons water  5 teaspoons kosher salt  4 stalks celery, diced.    1.
