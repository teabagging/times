ECONOMIC MEASUREMENTS -- Few if any fireworks are expected from the coming crop of economic reports, but expectations can always be wrong. Leading off the week will be the Federal Reserve's consumer credit report for June (Monday), followed by second-quarter productivity figures (Tuesday), wholesale trade data for June (Wednesday), trade deficit figures for June (Thursday) and, on Friday, import prices for July, retail sales for July and business inventories for June.

''It's the yin to modern's yang,'' says William Diamond, of Diamond Baratta Design, a Manhattan design firm that's famous for making Victorian mod. ''Victorian is all about excess.'' Not only is Victorian an excellent mixer, it's also a willing candidate for extreme makeovers, as exemplified by this chair that Diamond and his partner, Anthony Baratta, recreated.

But they all have to go through the same mill at Warners': Muni did it in \\"Scarface\\"","excerpt":"Cagney and Robinson are still doing it, and prospering at it too. So now they've made John Garfield a criminal, and since Mr. Garfield is young, resilient and no end talented, he is making the best of what, after all, is not such a bad situation.For a generous cast and on the whole an ample production have been flatteringly assembled about Mr. Garfield's ingratiating personality, and the result, it seems to us, is a better-than-average workout for a rising star. In spite of veteran scene-stealers like May Robson and the Dead End kids (give the boys another year to polish their routines of eye-poking, puss-slapping and precision spitting, and they can bill themselves as the Six Stooges) it is always Mr. Garfield, with his sublime self-confidence, the unhandsome attractiveness of his greasy, round, gamin face, who carries the show along.It seems that Mr. Garfield is a deadly but cynical prize-fighter, who privately carouses while publicly pretending to live a clean life and to love a non-existent mother. But one morning he wakes in a strange place, and a newspaper informs him that he was burned up in a car wreck the previous night, after murdering a reporter. A shady lawyer advises him to \\"stay dead,\\" and that is how it happens that Johnnie comes to Grandma Robson's date ranch in Arizona, where Tommy, Angel, Spit, Dippy, T. B. and Milt are rusticating on parole from reform school. Here it is, too, that he finally sees the light of respectability, his vision clarified by Gloria Dickson, among other things.Claude Rains, as the only New York detective who senses that Johnny wasn't in the death car that night, is the gentleman who precipitates the melodramatic crisis in which Johnnie self-sacrificially saves the ranch by taking on a barn-storming pugilist, though he knows the detective is watching him from a ringside seat. It's an elderly plot, all right, but Mr. Garfield is young; he will live it down.At the 86th St. Garden TheatreOnce again German film producers have invaded a foreign field and turned out a fine semi-historical picture while Holywood and Great Britain have just been talking about it.In making \\"Die Gruene Hoelle\\" (which ought to be called the \\"Romance of Rubber\\" instead of \\"The Green Hell\\"), Eduard von Borsody, a new UFA director, has embroidered with many hairbreadth escapes the feat of Sir Henry Wickham, the British explorer, who in 1876 brought 70,000 seeds of the \\"Hevea braziliensis\\" to English hot-houses after having, in the laconic language of the Encyclopedia Brittanica, \\"evaded the vigilance of the Brazilian Government.\\"This \\"vigilance\\" consisted, according to the scenarist of the piece now at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre and perhaps in truth, in the death penalty for any one caught smuggling rubber tree seeds out of the country. But the stalwart René Deltgen, as the daring Briton inspired by the India Office and the love of the pretty daughter (Vera Langen) of the British Consul at Para (Herbert Huebner), overcomes jungle beasts and human enemies and breaks Brazil's rubber monopoly.Gustav Diesel is excellent as a rich plantation owner, also in love with the British girl. In general the acting is good. The realism of some of the scenes is due to their having been shot by members of Dr. Franz Eichhorn's expedition to the Amazon country. There are English titles.At the Teatro HispanoIn advertisements of \\"El Beso Mortal\\" (The Fatal Kiss), the new picture at the Teatro Hispano, printed in Mexico City newspapers it was stated that it was \\"a moral film, not appropriate for señoritas.\\" On the other hand, some of the Mexican reviewers averred that this celluloid warning against ignorance regarding venereal diseases should be seen by every person of high school age and upward in the whole republic.This well-made lesson in health preservation is presented effectively, without too much drama or would-be horrendous scenes, and with considerable humor. All the actors are competent. Miguel Angel Ferriz, as the young specialist in love with the fiancée (Matilde Palou) of a rich youth (Julian Soler) in no condition for matrimony, is particularly convincing. Señor Soler adds to his deserved fame as one of Mexico's outstanding players. Magda Haller is highly sympathetic in the role of a nurse hopelessly enamored of the young physician.Ferando Rivero ably directed this Roberto Fierro production. There is nothing in the dialogue to shock Spanish-understanding señoritas or anybody else.At the 86th Street CasinoWhat might be labeled another glorification of life in rural Germany is at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre in the shape of a smoothly running, if somewhat lengthy, film called \\"Dahinten in der Heide\\" (Back in the Country). This time the supposedly dead heir who returns from the United States, where he has had pretty tough luck, just in time to block the mis-mating of the heroine (Hilde Weissner) and to keep the estate in the family, is the popular Hans Stuewe.Helmuth Rudolph does well as the rich baron foiled in his attempt to \\"frame\\" his rival in a shooting episode. Much of the fun in the action goes to the credit of Hermann Speelmans, as the heir's pal from America. There are numerous lovely views of the countryside and many amusing incidents featuring realistic peasant folks before a smart police inspector unravels the simple plot. Carl Boese directed the picture for the Gustav Althof concern.
