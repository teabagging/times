Tass statement and Gromyko lr causes confusion among US diplomats, who are uncertain whether publication constitutes face-saving device or actual declaration that USSR will not make concessions on emigration; US diplomat says that Soviet language of denial does not entirely rule out some sort of informal understanding and that response might be intended generally for domestic consumption; such a interpretation is not shared by several more pessimistic observers; announcement appears to be key to pending Cong vote on bill granting trade concessions for easing of USSR's emigration policy; denial may also have resulted from session of party's Central Com, at which emigration is believed to have been discussed; Soviet leadership may have resolved to take tougher stand rather than allow Cong assumptions about compromise to pass unchallenged; move may have been spurred cither by conservative pressure from within Kremlin or by official anger at publicity purported agreement has received in US; it is also possible that USSR was moved to act by Arab criticism of emigration of Soviet Jews and particularly Egypt's proposal that Israel restrict further immigration; announcement does not state why Soviet Govt waited 2 mos to dispute belief that there was agreement, particularly since it would have to be aware of awkward situation that denial would create for Kissinger; Tass statement says extension of trade benefits to USSR was expected under summit agreement made in '72; adds that opponents of normalizing US-USSR trade and of improving US-USSR relations from very outset began actively hampering process by making extension of trade concessions 'dependent on all kinds of qualifications and demands that are nothing but gross interference in USSR's internal affairs' (L) LETTER PUBLISHED In it, Gromyko Tells Kissinger a Linkage Is Ruled Out"},{"year":"2004","title":"Rep Ernest Istook, chairman of appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over Internal Revenue Service budget, says that measure allowing some lawmakers and their staffs to examine Americans' income tax returns had been inserted in huge spending bill by staff assistant without his knowledge","excerpt":"asserts that 'nobody's privacy was ever jeopardized' (S) Panel Chief Denies Knowing About Item on Inspecting Tax Returns"},{"year":"1973","title":"ed charges that after 2 attempts to gerrymander NYC's minority groups out of any real opportunity to increase their representation in City Council, Council's incumbent members have finally adopted new district lines that seem to conform to legal criteria of compactness, convenience and contiguity","excerpt":"asserts that 'responsible effort' had to be coerced Third‐Try Success"},{"year":"1971","title":"Latvian party orgn head A E Voss assails Latvians who are so nationalistic that they want to prevent migration of Russian and other non-Latvian peoples to Latvia, article in Pravda","excerpt":"asserts that 'some people of localist tendencies' in Latvia oppose construction of big indus and power projects out of fear that projects would lead to influx of non-Latvians and increase in mixed marriages;
