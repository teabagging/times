The film tells the story of Josh Waitzkin, a gifted young chess player growing up in the shadow of the legendary boy wonder, the one whose name is still mentioned in awestruck tones. Yet Mr. Fischer, who is seen here in old news clips as a boy playing against rows of different grown-up opponents and otherwise dazzling the chess establishment, is as well remembered for arrogance and eccentricity as he is for brilliance. Hovering over this absorbing story, the image of Mr. Fischer embodies genius as a double-edged sword.   The price of being a prodigy is very much at the heart of \\"Searching for Bobby Fischer,\\" which is adapted from the book by Fred Waitzkin about his son's experience. As written and directed thoughtfully by Steven Zaillian (whose other, much broader screenplays include \\"Awakenings\\" and \\"Jack the Bear\\"), the film seems to worry about the very talents it also celebrates. This separates it valuably from the standard-issue success story it occasionally approaches.

Haig Jr. wants to play with history to justify Administration policy in \\"Gulf Analogy: Munich or Vietnam?\\" (Op-Ed, Dec. 10), he should get his analogies straight.   If there is an analogy to Munich in the Persian Gulf, for example, it applies only to the long record of United States appeasement of Saddam Hussein, beginning with our convenient silence in 1980 when he attacked Iran. And extending to our failure to condemn his use of poison gas against Iranians and his own Kurdish population. And to our neglect for months -- which he understandably took for tacit approval -- of his clear signals that he intended, one way or another, to settle his Kuwait problem to his advantage. We have always treated Saddam Hussein as a useful tool in the gulf. Not even his attack on the Navy frigate Stark in May 1987 (killing 37 American sailors) could move us to do more than slap his wrist.   As for Mr. Haig's Vietnam analogy, it is ridiculous to assert that a declaration of war would have made no difference. Declared wars give governments enormous power to censor news, suppress dissidence, manipulate public opinion, mobilize national resources and transform debatable causes into patriotic crusades.   Mr. Haig refers to United States policy in Vietnam as self-defeating, and there may be something of an analogy with the gulf. If so, it relates less to clear goals and winning or losing than to having an inadequate appreciation of the probable human and historical consequences of our actions.   JOHN G.

That's the case for Li Yang's  &quot","excerpt":"Blind Shaft&quot; and the China-set story allows him to create a hybrid and convey his documentary experience, steadily adding more and more character detail until a dazzling shocker moment at its climax; it's as if someone had unearthed a nonfiction film made by Cornell Woolrich.  &quot;Shaft&quot; starts in a dilapidated mining complex, and the picture has the bleak, grinding atmosphere of a real-life look at underpaid, trapped miners doing their jobs; a spooky shot of an elevator descending into the mine rings true because it creates mood and, later, serves as metaphor. Initially, the picture is harsh and claustrophobic enough to make us expect we're going to have to endure a collapse that will strand the workers in the dark, hard-to-see environment. Eventually, there is a collapse —  but it occurs after one of the workers kills a man and flees the site. His partner makes a bogus claim against the mine owner, extorting a payoff over the death of his &quot;brother,&quot; who died in the avalanche. This is the life they lead, moving from one shabby mining operation to another, conjuring faked ID's and collecting on the death of a &quot;relative.&quot; They then burn through the money on whores and alcohol. The mine owners they bilk are just as heartless —  they'd rather throw money at the problem instead of have it investigated.  Because &quot;Shaft&quot; is directed with airtight ruthlessness, its relentless and tough-minded storytelling has a grueling precision. The film wrings humor out of the pettiness of its determined killers. Its brooding meticulousness, and lack of flourish, evokes an old-school B-picture before the genre was over-inflated — and sentimentalized — into big-budget doggerel here in the United States; &quot;Shaft&quot; could be set in one of those faded boomtowns outside of Las Vegas and guided by Sam Fuller. The wan, gray skies and omnipresent squalor give the movie the feel of a black and white film, though splashes of color filter through occasionally. When someone does get around to remaking &quot;Shaft&quot; — and the film deserves such revisiting — let's hope the new version doesn't implode from gooey or overstated emotion.  &quot;Shaft&quot; deftly swings to a spartan, engrossing climax, and the final twists spell out what the murderers are made of and the setting responsible for them in the first place: a true piece of film magic. — Elvis Mitchell Descending Into the Pit Of Humanity"},{"year":"1952","title":"The appearance of Bill Bangert, a three-time National Amateur Athletic Union shot-put champion, was the highlight of the track writers' luncheon at Leone's yesterday.

Maurice Summers, a former Royal Air Force Wing Commander and Test Pilot, director of E.F.

His first flight was on January 15, 1930 at the age of 18. He served on active duty in the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm until 1934 when he became a test pilot. Prior to World War II, Mr. Summers delivered aircraft around the world including two tours with the Chinese Air Force in 1937 and 1939. In 1940, Mr. Summers was placed in charge of Bomber Development Flying for Vickers Armstrong. In March 1941, he piloted the first B-24 ''Liberator'' Bomber to England setting the then Trans-Atlantic speed record of 7-1/2 hours. Twice during his flying career Mr. Summers' life was saved by parachute. In 1950 Mr. Summers became a member of the New York Stock Exchange, and was made a partner of E.F. Hutton in 1953. He later became a Director until his retirement in 1973. He served as a Governor of the New York Stock Exchange from 1970 to 1973. With his retirement from Wall Street he returned to flying and participated in the National Aerobatics Championships at age 62. Mr. Summers started his third career as a real estate developer in Florida in the 1970's building single family houses and rental apartments. Mr. Summers was a member of the Everglades Club in Palm Beach, FL, the Piping Rock Club in Locust Valley, NY, and the Royal Air Force Club in London.

It is an exceptionally well-told story, based on one written by Dana Burnet, and Richard Wallace, the director, does marvels with his camera, both in avoiding subtitles where he can and also in giving a comprehensive conception of the passage of time. Yet, with all these alluring qualities, the producers have seen fit to tag on to the end a talking chapter, which, while it does not actually hurt the picture, at least unlocks the tongues of people who have been silent for most of the time. Moreover, this audible stretch would have been far better if words had been left to the imagination.Few examples of motion picture work have possessed the brilliancy of this new Paramount offering. Mr. Wallace not only guides his scenes with restraint but he has steered clear of the conventional final fadeout.During the screening of this tale of a man's blissful ignorance and the sophisticated amour of a girl, one is impelled to hark back to Perceval Gibbons's unforgettable story, \\"The Icon.\\" The spirit of this fable is much the same as Mr. Gibbons's short classic, but here we have a romance, a clodhopper's adoration that conquered the heart of a gold-digger.This picture opens with a flash of President Wilson. The war is on. and William Tyler, played by Gary Cooper. is one of Uncle Sam's millions. He encounters Daisy Heath, a chorus girl with gleaming slave bracelets. To the doughboy, Daisy is just a bit higher than a lady, or as near an angel as mortal can get. To him she is also a lily. A hint to the reverse means a hornet-like jab from the lean Texan's fist.Yes, Tyler thinks she's a lady. A fraction of a second later the camera discloses Daisy in one of her periods of abandon. Tyler is happy in the fact that he has obtained a photograph of the Lady. He puts the picture at the foot of his cot and frames it with his big feet, which, it is known to him, occasionally have irritated the Lady when dancing.It was a whim of the lady to notice the lean Westerner. It was a heaven-sent blessing to Tyler that such a creature could deign to speak to him. In his great State he had never seen anybody like her. She glistened, she smiled, she could dance, she attracted every eye when she entered a room.Soon comes the time for Tyler to embark for France. This war is interfering with the most important thing in his life! No matter what be the consequences, Tyler is resolved to see Daisy once again before leaving for the fighting zone. No officer could understand this adoration! Hence Private Tyler risks the penalty and is A. W. O. L. He and Daisy go to Coney Island, Daisy, it is explained, is also A. W. O. L. from the effete gentleman who showers her with worldly goods.Mr. Wallace revels in his Coney Island sequence. It is cleverly accomplished. Somehow or other it affects the gold-digging Daisy. Such love as Tyler's, the Lady had never dreamed of.There is an impressive ending, for which one feels thankful, for it takes but little to spoil any story, no matter how finely it may be filmed.Gary Cooper gives a wonderfully sensitive performance as the love-smitten doughboy. Nancy Carroll's acting shows a nice appreciation for Daisy's moods. Miss Carroll's contribution is indeed admirable. Paul Lukas is excellent as the buyer of beauty.

My overriding objections to the block-grant concept are economic.  But there is also a political consideration - perhaps ''ethical'' would be a better word - having to do with the Reagan Administration's responsibility to the people who elected him.  Presumably, they have a right to expect the Administration to articulate policies, to allocate Federal funds for the implementation of those policies and to take the responsibility for their success or failure. What we get under the block grant is just the opposite -50 separate policies and the consequent blurring and fragmentation of responsibility, the ostensible easing of a financial burden at the Federal level at the risk of creating 50 much heavier burdens at the state level.

The small mercy to be thankful for after viewing this production, heralded as \\"The Scarlet Lady,\\" is that its sponsors were at least sufficiently considerate to forego the temptation to make it a talking film. One shudders to think what the result might have been if Lya De Putti, Warner Oland and Don Alvarado had been called upon to speak aloud the lines allotted to them by the writer of the lurid titles.Miss De Putti, who won her screen laurels by her portrayal of the siren in \\"Variety,\\" in this current photodrama figures as one of those fickle revolutionists who doesn't know her own mind after she meets the Prince. She is more or less torn between loyalty to her cause and admiration she feels for the handsome Romanoff. It is Prince Karloff who saves her from the Czarist troops, but being a lady of sorts, who relishes having her nest well feathered, she bears with the forbidding Zaneriff, leader of the mob, because she is able to indulge her fancy for sparkling ornaments. As a token of gratitude, after the debacle of the Czarists, she uses her horsewhip on the Prince's well-chiseled countenance, but Alan Crosland, the director, sees to it that the Prince's featurs are not disfigured.Yet, one presumes that she is still in love with the young man, especially after what happens in the supposedly thrilling closing scenes.Zaneriff (Mr. Oland), having beheld this \\"lady\\" in the Prince's arms, decides after the young aristocrat's capture to teach Lya a lesson. It is the sort of lesson any young \\"lady\\" would be apt to remember for many a day. Zaneriff first has a banquet. He's always in a gleeful mood when he knows that he has to put a score of Czarists to death. He likes to do it after breakfast, as a rule, but as the Prince is in one particular group he saves shooting them until after his demi tasse in the evening and while he is still sober enough to sip more wine and aim accurately with his pistol.Zaneriff escorts Lya to a cellar below the banquet chamber, where Lya sees a huge grave being dug by unseen men. Zaneriff gives the command to cease digging and the prisoners are made to stand on the edge of the grave. The revolutionary leader takes a drink of wine. Then he closes one eye and aims, ending the life of a Czarist. He keeps this up until only the Prince is left standing. Then the murderous Zaneriff with courtly grace offers Lya the pistol to kill the Prince. Tears come to the \\"lady's\\" eyes and she puts on her fur cloak, having taken off her sparkling tiara apparently because she was at first uncomfortably warm. There is method in her madness, for soon she says that she is too far away to shoot the young Prince. One has a decided premonition of what's going to happen, and it does.The Prince and Lya escape, and various types of wheels are seen as well as the information that the Prince and Lya are beyond the frontier. The iron wheels dissolve into wooden wheels and then one perceives the Prince and Lya riding happily through a peaceful, sunlit land.Pistol shots were snapped out by somebody in the orchestra pit and the sounds made when characters politely knocked on doors were just about as loud.It is all very awful, but so was the Russian Revolution.Miss DePutti looks best in a man's uniform. Don Alvarado, who impersonates the Prince, gives a suggestion of John Gilbert's grin at inopportune moments. Mr. Oland's acting is really capital, but it might have been in a better cause.

These are among the stale-but-true bromides that are acknowledged by the title character in Donald Margulies's sincere but doggedly unsurprising new play about the midlife crisis of a suddenly successful novelist (Adam Arkin). While this comic drama is steeped in an admirably humble and often touching spirit of acceptance, it seldom does what Mr. Margulies has achieved repeatedly before: make the familiar seem fresh. Polly Draper and Ari Graynor stand out in an excellent cast, smoothly directed by Daniel Sullivan (2:20). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $26 to $79.  BEN BRANTLEY    +'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Heard not so long ago issuing from the plus-size form of Edna Turnblad in the musical ''Hairspray,'' Mr. Fierstein's voice is one of the most distinctive in theater, variously evoking a kazoo, a congested saxophone, wind in a bottle and echoes from a crypt. It is, in a way, its own multicolored show. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to Mr. Leveaux's abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $100.  BRANTLEY    +'GOOD VIBRATIONS' Even those who believe that everything on this planet has a purpose may at first have trouble justifying the existence of ''Good Vibrations,'' the singing headache that manages to purge all catchiness from the surpassingly catchy hits of the Beach Boys. But audience members strong enough to sit through this rickety jukebox of a show will discover that the production, directed and choreographed by John Carrafa, does have a reason to be. ''Good Vibrations'' sacrifices itself to make all other musicals on Broadway look good. As the show's washboard-stomached performers smile, wriggle and squeak with the desperation of wet young things hung out to dry, you feel their pain. It is unlikely, however, to be more acute than yours (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $76 to $101; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets are available at the box office on the day of the show.  BRANTLEY    +'LITTLE WOMEN' Sutton Foster never merely walks when she can scamper in this perky, sketchy adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of a Civil War-era New England girlhood. Portraying Jo the tomboy, Ms. Foster creates a dizzyingly hyperkinetic creature who, were she living in the 21st century, would probably be on Ritalin. Ms. Foster (a Tony winner for ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'') shows a gift for fresh, comic line readings. But her energy is often less infectious than exhausting. The same can be said of the show, directed by Susan H. Schulman and featuring a book by Allan Knee, with songs by Jason Howland and Mindi Dickstein. Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members, who include the mellow-voiced Maureen McGovern, mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of the American Girl series of dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $100.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    +'BELFAST BLUES' The ''Belfast Blues'' of Geraldine Hughes's solo show aren't the kind you'd expect. Yes, the ''troubles'' between Roman Catholics and Protestants that have roiled Northern Ireland for decades do cast an emotional shadow over this heartfelt and funny if unexceptional stage memoir, descriptively subtitled ''one wee girl's story about family, war, Jesus and Hollywood.'' But Ms. Hughes's title more directly refers to her big, inquisitive and exceptionally expressive eyes, which helped secure that wee girl a ticket to a happier life. ''Belfast Blues,'' which recounts her experience growing up amid poverty and violence in Belfast in the 1970's and 80's, does not bring any groundbreaking insights to familiar territory. But Ms. Hughes is a bright, inviting presence, and the surprising agent of her deliverance from the troubled atmosphere of her youth gives the show a modestly refreshing twist (1:25). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $45; a limited number of $20 student rush tickets are available at the box office one hour before the performance.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' In this stunningly powerful production, an intriguing balance arises between Lopakhin, the bourgeois former serf, and the aristocratic family that owns the cherry orchard and whose fortunes are all but dried up. The landowner Lyubov Ranevskaya (Petronia Paley), returning penniless from her life abroad, is as elegant as she is self-delusional. Against her beauty and her dignity, Lopakhin (Wendell Pierce), the archetype of the small-minded arriviste, is a hard man to like. But this production brings out their shared past in subtle but forceful gestures that complicate the audience's sympathies (2:00). Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25.  CAMPBELL ROBERTSON    'COUNSELLOR-AT-LAW' Entertainment in abundance radiates from the Peccadillo Theater Company's new production of this old Elmer Rice drama. Starring the Tony Award-winning John Rubinstein, ''Counsellor-at-Law'' is a drama that throbs with New York life and brims with touchstones of another time, like ''George White's Scandals'' and the Court of General Sessions. But it also retains relevance to ambition and success in the 21st century. It has a hero worth rooting for, a healthy dose of sacred and profane love, some sharp jabs at class difference, villains who merit a hearty hiss and plenty of New York attitude and humor (2:45). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $55; $20 student rush tickets available at the box office 15 minutes before the show.  LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    *'THE GODS ARE POUNDING MY HEAD! (AKA LUMBERJACK MESSIAH)' Even lumberjacks get the cosmic blues in the world of Richard Foreman, the Florenz Ziegfeld of avant-garde drama. In many ways, this show is a typical Foreman extravaganza: tightly orchestrated hallucinogenic visual effects, bruising slapstick and cryptic, fragmented dialogue. But there is also a newly wistful, elegiac note here. ''Gods,'' which features Jay Smith and T. Ryder Smith as a pair of weary woodsmen, is as majestically mad and funny as any Foreman spectacle. But it also has a sadness appropriate to what appears to be a farewell note of sorts, since Mr. Foreman has said he is giving up the kind of plays he has been creating since 1968 to focus on film (1:10). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, (212)533-4650. Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m. Tickets: weekdays $20, $15 for students; $25 for Saturday performances.  BRANTLEY    'A LIFE A BROAD (MI VIDA EN JIRA)' Melanie Rey has a big bright voice, and her one-woman show is a musical. She style-surfs through multiple styles in English and Spanish: ballads, Anglo rock, R&B and Tex-Mex. She is an accomplished actor too, but the word ''accomplished'' often means that an actor with all the right moves shows them all too predictably. A one-person 90-minute show needs more. Ms Rey's real talent comes through unstrained when she plays her passionate, husband-hunting mother. When she plays herself, she is working too hard to win our love (1:30). Greenwich Street Theater, 547 Greenwich Street, (212) 252-2439. Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m.; Mondays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $30.  MARGO JEFFERSON    +'SABINA' Once a forgotten ghost in the annals of psychoanalysis, Sabina Spielrein is proving to have surprising staying power. A patient of Carl Jung and an acquaintance of Sigmund Freud who ultimately became a psychoanalyst herself, Spielrein has a history that has provided material for two movies and two plays. The first of these was Willy Holtzman's ''Sabina,'' first produced by Primary Stages in 1996 and now in revival as part of the company's 20th-anniversary season. The new production, directed by Ethan McSweeny, is hampered by an unsatisfactory performance from Marin Ireland in the title role. But the history of Spielrein's relationships with the founder of psychoanalysis and his protégé turned apostate is nonetheless engrossing. It provides a provocative window into the much-studied relationship between Freud and Jung. Peter Strauss gives an admirably understated performance as a paternalistic Freud, and Victor Slezak, as Jung, gives persuasive dramatic life to a now-mythic figure. (2:15). Primary Stages, at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays though Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    'SHYLOCK' Deconstructing Shakespeare is a dangerous sport; it's impossible to be more imaginative or clever than the playwright himself, even if you are Harold Bloom. Gareth Armstrong gives it a game try, but ''Shylock,'' his 80-minute dissertation on the evolution of one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters, although deftly performed, is no exception. While his pocket synopses of anti-Semitism, Elizabethan England, Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' and even a Baedeker of famous actors' renditions of Shylock are edifying, they are not sufficiently enlightening or entertaining. The most riveting lines of Mr. Armstrong's monologue belong to Shakespeare himself (1:35). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55; a limited number of $20 student/senior rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance.  PHOEBE HOBAN    ++'SLEEPING BEAUTY' Trust a British ''Sleeping Beauty'' to pivot on a fairy's flatulence. Yes, that surefire laugh trigger in old Blighty plays an unexpectedly large role in Rufus Norris's murky new version of the familiar fairy tale for the Young Vic Theater Company. Mr. Norris, a talented young British director whose Broadway-bound production of ''Festen'' snapped up many London theater awards, isn't interested in pretty pictures. His vigorously staged, grotesquely comic ''Sleeping Beauty,'' which unfolds in smoky darkness beneath a queasy yellow moon, is entirely in tune with the current vogue for teasing out thickets of disturbing subtext in children's literature. The production's eccentric designs accentuate the predominantly eerie air (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 7; tomorrow and Sunday at 1 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $10, $20 and $30.  ISHERWOOD    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as standup existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. This monologue, which runs just over an hour and requires minimal stagecraft, is as unassuming in its means as it is astonishing in its impact. It's one of those treasured nights in the theater -- treasured nights anywhere, for that matter -- that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Mr. Eno and his performer, the actor James Urbaniak, hereby reinvent that seemingly moribund theatrical genre, the solo show. They are immeasurably aided by the work of the director Hal Brooks. Mr. Eno's voice, or the voice of the narrator/protagonist/master of ceremonies played by Mr. Urbaniak, is alternately lyrical and affectless, ecstatic and flat, sardonic and sincere. Standup-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative: Mr. Eno might be called a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation. Let's try that again, minus the conditional: Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets; $45.  ISHERWOOD    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' This lovably inconsequential, entirely adorable new musical brings to the stage the culture's current mania for celebrating that most revered of American virtues, the will to victory. A mock spelling bee, it pokes serious fun at its twitchy tween contestants -- in the loopy spirit of the movies ''Waiting for Guffman'' and ''Best in Show'' -- but also pays affectionate tribute to these quirky young spelling titans. William Finn's nimble, upbeat score provides the emotional underpinning for Rachel Sheinkin's more satirical -- indeed often riotously funny -- book. The director James Lapine, Mr. Finn's collaborator on ''Falsettos,'' is also in impeccable form, managing to transform into virtues two of the theater's most reliable pitfalls, namely audience participation and the usually ghastly conceit of adult actors' playing kids (1:45). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $75.  ISHERWOOD    'WE'RE STILL HOT' A sign onstage in this melodramatic musical reads ''Welcome back, class of 1970,'' but this is misleading. The show is not about the experience of a class reunion. It is about a musical revue being written for that reunion, starring three old high school friends, now in their 50's, and a Hungarian cleaning woman who happens to be passing by. One alumna is a successful businesswoman (Deirdre Kingsbury), one is a rich man's uptight wife (Marnee Hollis), one is a complete failure (Deborah Jean Templin), and the pushy cleaning woman (Jane Seaman) was a stage star back home. J.J. McColl, the playwright and lyricist, makes Act I painful, with numbers like ''Nothing Special'' (it certainly isn't), ''Hormones'' and ''Whirligig Glands.'' Things improve a bit in Act II, as the humor turns to the ravages of aging (2:00). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, (212)352-3101. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ANITA GATES    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater. It is always paying homage to itself. Parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs is smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get In the case of ''The Musical of Musicals!'' Two of the performers are also the creators: Joanne Bogart (lyrics) and Eric Rockwell. (music). Aided by Lovette George and Craig Fols, they offer spoofs in the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Kander and Ebb. The best parodists don't sneer, they tease, and share the form's joie de vivre.'' Aficianados will get every joke and neophytes will laugh too. ''The Musical of Musicals!'' creates its own lightly absurd world (90 minutes). Dodger Stages, 340 West 5oth Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 4 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $59.50.  JEFFERSON    Off Off Broadway    'DAY OF RECKONING' This play about the anarchist and labor reformer Lucy Parsons is unevenly paced and clumsily staged, but it has this saving grace: unlike some other theatrical efforts associated with Black History Month, it is not shallow hero worship. Parsons was a decidedly flawed hero, and Melody Cooper, the playwright, leaves those flaws in plain sight. As a young woman, Parsons, played by Ms. Cooper, called herself Lucy Gonzalez and tried to pass as Mexican and American Indian, chafing at any suggestion that she was black. And in her militant-labor phase, with her white husband, Albert, she exhorted followers, ''Learn to use explosives.'' When the Parsonses' domestic bliss is shattered by the Haymarket Riot of 1886, Lucy loses her bearings, and her son pays an appalling price. Ms. Cooper's recounting of this fascinating life could benefit from a large infusion of understatement, but still, Parsons's story is one that deserves to be told, especially at a time when those with radical ideas are again under intense scrutiny (1:50). All Stars Project's Performing Arts and Education Center, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)941-1234. Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $15.  NEIL GENZLINGER    'THE FLID SHOW' With the drug Vioxx making headlines because of its recent recall over adverse side effects, Richard Willett's play gains an unsettling topicality. The play traces the history of Thalidomide, the sleeping pill widely distributed in Europe in the late 1950's and early 60's that caused birth defects when taken by pregnant women. Mat Fraser, a seasoned and charismatic British actor who was himself a ''Thalidomide baby,'' stars as Duncan, a lounge singer coming to grips with the anger and resentment fueled by his lifelong struggles. In Mr. Willett's fanciful dramatic scheme -- borrowed from a certain Dickens holiday favorite, as he acknowledges -- Duncan's psychological scars are healed by a series of ghostly visitors who sweep him through time and space. The documentary aspects of the play are absorbing and often poignant, but Duncan's personal story, centering on his rocky romance with a doctor and a reconciliation, in spirit at least, with his dead mother, is crudely drawn and clichéd (2:15). Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101. Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $15; $30 for a special benefit performance on Feb. 24.  ISHERWOOD    'THE SECRET NARRATIVE OF THE PHONE BOOK' Spouting cascades of words, like fireboats expelling water in a harbor parade, the four actors in Gordon Cox's satiric new play manage to keep the pressure high for the first half of the evening's 90 minutes. It's a feat, because the self-described ''romantic comedy hijacked by a conspiracy thriller'' ultimately falls victim to overearnest lecturing and a convoluted plot about media control by a Big Brother phone company. Still, the fact that Mr. Cox, a theater critic for Newsday, obviously loves language, makes the early scenes a kick to hear (1:30). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, (212)868-4444. Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; added performance Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $15; $8 for students.  ANDREA STEVENS    Last Chance    'THE CONFESSIONS OF PUNCH AND JUDY' The anarchist Punch and his wife, Judy, have been beating each other senseless for centuries, but while the famously warring married couple is usually performed by puppets, two real-life actors do the quarreling in this rigorously performed modern update with a surplus of energy and a deficit of direction. Ker Wells and Tannis Kowalchuk, who wrote the drama with the director Raymond Bobgan, play the pair in this pedestrian production, which mixes mime, ballroom dance, first-person monologues, puppetry and naturalistic acting (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212)868-4444. Tonight, tomorrow and, final performance, Sunday at 7 p.m. Tickets: $15.  JASON ZINOMAN    'BYE MOM! OR, HOW NOT TO BURY YOUR MOTHER' This tongue-in-cheek comedy is the debut play of Susan Austin Roth, whose gardening books have sold more than 1.5 million copies. Its eye-catching title hints at Ms. Roth's experience writing guide books and it's easy to see a commercial, if still green, sensibility in the play's broad comic caricatures When Ethel falls into a coma, her children fly down to her home in Florida and take this opportunity to really let the old woman have it. But two hours of complaints aren't just for petty revenge. It also allows the family to dredge up old fights, reveal secrets and embrace in the end -- you know, the way families do in contrived two act-plays. Ms Roth has written what feels like a rough draft with potential (2:00). 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, (212)279-4200. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $15.  ZINOMAN    'FINDING CLAIRE' In Kim Merrill's lovely, sensitive, engrossing one-act play, Geneva Carr does a remarkable thing. She begins to cry, so suddenly and so intensely, that the audience laughs. Then her pain asserts itself and the audience sympathizes. Finally, she turns little-girlish (''She was really nice,'' she says of her dead mother. ''Not like here with you''), and the audience laughs again. It's a neat trick that takes theatergoers along for the character's roller-coaster ride of emotion. Ms. Carr plays an affluent 30-ish New York dancer who seeks out her birth mother, Claire Defaux (Deirdre Madigan), and finds a new family with old problems. Helen Gallagher plays Claire's domineering mother; Shana Dowdeswell is Claire's 15-year-old pregnant daughter. The cast is outstanding, if not fully convincing as lower middle class. Ms. Merrill's graceful script and Susan Einhorn's assured direction smooth over the twinges of mild disbelief (1:15). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at East 10th Street, (212)254-1109. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $10.  ANITA GATES    'PYRETOWN' There is plenty in John Belluso's play that resonates about the lack of universal health care in this country and the harsh consequences for many Americans -- as seen through two characters: Louise, a welfare mother (the waiflike Deirdre O'Connell) , and Harry, a disabled Web designer (the adroit Christopher Thornton), who falls in love with Louise. But Mr. Belluso would do better to leave his message in the hands of his characters and let them deliver it in their own way (80 min). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212)868-4444. Tonight and tomorrow at 8; final performance, Sunday at 2 p.m.. Tickets: $19.  STEVENS    'WASTED (THE MYSTERY/HISTORY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND HOW IT GOT THAT WAY)' In ''Wasted,'' the Irondale Ensemble Project tries to answer a very difficult question: How do you make a play about the history of the public school system in American without being terribly boring? While they came up with a number of solutions, none were satisfactory. History is reduced to good guys and bad guys, who both talk in slogans: should school teach kids to think for themselves or prepare them for the workforce? The decline of the school system is told simply as a story of dark conspiracies motivated by corporate greed. In the end, you get the sense that this show is made by people who have spent little time reflecting on the ideas of the other side (2:00). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tickets: $25; $15 for 65+, students and New York City Public School teachers.  ZINOMAN    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'ALIENS OF THE DEEP' Directed by James Cameron and Steven Quale. (G, 48 minutes). When Mr. Cameron proclaimed himself ''king of the world'' on winning the Oscar for ''Titanic,'' who knew that he also had designs on the rest of the solar system? His newest film is a grandiose hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy that begins on our planet's ocean floor and ends many miles under the ice crust that covers Europa, the second moon of Jupiter. The movie's sneaky transition from undersea documentary to speculative fantasy of a journey yet to be undertaken is so seamless that you could easily mistake the last portion of the film for the record of an actual space voyage. Mr. Cameron's theory, supported by astrobiologists, is that the life forms found at the deepest levels of the ocean where no light from the sun penetrates may hold clues to the nature of possible life in outer space. Filmed in Imax 3-D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone -- two times when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie, where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, that preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'BOOGEYMAN' Starring Barry Watson. Directed by Stephen Kay (PG-13, 86 minutes). There are a lot of close-ups of doorknobs and water faucets in Mr. Kay's would-be horror film. There is a supernaturally speedy killing accomplished with heavy-duty plastic wrap. There is frequent whooshing and rapid camera movement. Despite all of that, it isn't scary. Mr. Watson, of ''Seventh Heaven,'' plays Tim, a grown man who has been afraid of the boogeyman ever since he was 8, when something creepy sucked his father into a closet and out of this life. After his mother's death, Tim vows to spend a night in his childhood home to allay his fears, but, sure enough, the boogeyman is back and after him and everyone he cares about (well, an uncle and two girlfriends). The house is very creaky; so is the movie.  ANITA GATES    'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' Starring Martin Henderson and Aishwarya Rai. Directed by Gurinder Chadha (PG-13, 111 minutes). Because Ms. Chadha knows how to sell multiplex multiculturalism -- her last feature was ''Bend It Like Beckham'' -- the pitch for her new film probably ran something along the lines of: ''Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' recontextualized as a Bollywood musical (only shorter) and set against the backdrop of the new global economy.'' Whatever the case, the new film -- which transposes Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India, with layovers in swinging London and sunny Los Angeles -- is as high concept and rife with cliché as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. Think ''My Big Fat Sari Wedding'' tricked out with clumsy song-and-dance numbers and delivered with much finger-wagging about cultural tolerance. The kicker here being that the wagging finger belongs to the story's heroine, here called Lalita (Ms. Rai, radiantly beautiful but inert), and the object of her high-mindedness is none other than a wealthy American, Will Darcy (Mr. Henderson, just inert).  DARGIS    'COACH CARTER' Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown and Rick Gonzalez. Directed by Thomas Carter (PG-13, 137 minutes). In this solid, unsurprising inspirational-coach drama, Mr. Jackson plays Ken Carter, who returns to his old high school in the tough Northern California city of Richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners, both on and off the court. Based on a true story, the movie combines sports-picture suspense with heroic-educator uplift when Carter, dismayed that his players are slipping academically, padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season. Mr. Carter (the director, not related to the coach) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism, which are bolstered by the hip-hop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members, especially Mr. Brown as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities, Ashanti as his girlfriend, and Mr. Gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime.  A.O.SCOTT    *'HEAD-ON' Starring Birol Unel, Sibel Kekilli and Guven Kirac. Directed by Fatih Akin (Not rated, 118 minutes; in German and Turkish, with English subtitles). Love doesn't just hurt in this jagged German romance; it cuts and bleeds and even kills. A story about a lonely man and a still-lonelier woman fighting against their worlds and what often seems like their own best interests, the film has caused a stir in Germany for the murky, troubling light it sheds on the lives of the country's Turkish immigrants. Its popularity made it a fleeting social phenomenon and a minor cultural footnote. But it doesn't explain why this film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of this very young year. One of the truisms about romances, even those shaded pitch black and set to banging rock music, is that you have to fall in love with the characters when they're falling for each other. It takes a long time for Cahit (Mr. Unel) and Sibel (Ms. Kekilli) to get inside each other's heads, much less anywhere else, but it doesn't take us long to care about these two perfectly imperfect beings.  DARGIS    'HIDE AND SEEK' Starring Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, and Amy Irving. . Directed by John Polson. (R, 105 minutes). In this downbeat, sufficiently unsettling film, Mr. De Niro plays a New York City shrink, David, who's married to a somnolent type (Ms. Irving), whose love for their daughter, Emily (Ms. Fanning), can't disguise her unhappiness. Soon after the story starts, violence descends on the family, and David and Emily move to the country for some healing. Once there, things go from lousy to worse, as Emily starts staring blankly into the surrounding woods and palling around with a sinister invisible friend called Charlie. Blood drips into the story; then it pours. One of the most gifted child actors around, Ms. Fanning has both chops and a preternaturally intense screen presence; even when you don't believe the setup, you buy what she is selling. That's a good thing when it comes to this horror-thriller hybrid, which was written by Ari Schlossberg and needs all the help it can get from its actors.  DARGIS    'HITCH' Starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James and Amber Valetta. Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13, 115 minutes). As soft and sweet as a marshmallow, and about as interesting, this genial romantic comedy features the ever-charming Mr. Smith as a dating coach who helps hapless Manhattan men snag women much better looking than they are. His own head is turned by Ms. Mendes, playing surely the most kindly gossip columnist ever to grace the pages of a New York tabloid. Complications, as always, ensue, but nothing too challenging or painful, either for the central couple or for the audience. Mr. James, best known as the portly King of Queens on television, is around for comic relief as an especially needy client, who is smitten with the willowy Ms. Valletta.  SCOTT    'LOST EMBRACE' Starring Daniel Hendler, Adriana Aizenberg and Atilio Pozzobón. Directed by Daniel Burman (not rated, 100 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). Set in a shabby Buenos Aires shopping mall, this antic, melancholy comedy gives a Latin American twist to a story of young, male Jewish identity crisis that will be familiar to fans of Philip Roth, Neil Simon and Woody Allen. Ariel (the fast-moving, nervous-looking Mr. Hendler) is a young man in a hurry, without much of a sense of direction. He carries on an anxious affair with an older woman, pines for his former girlfriend, and fantasizes about emigrating to Poland, from which his family fled two generations before. Mostly, though, he is haunted by the absence of his father, Elias, who abandoned him as a baby to go to Israel to fight in the 1973 war. The film, while busy and diffuse, is also touching and funny, and its modesty and haphazardness are among its charms.  SCOTT    *'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent interpretation from Mr. Radford and a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that in evoking Velázquez, Rembrandt, Titian and Vermeer immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.  SCOTT    *'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio in 2004.  SCOTT    *'NOBODY KNOWS' Starring Yuya Yagira. . Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda (PG-13, 141 minutes; in Japanese, with English subtitles). Based on the true story of four children abandoned by their mother in a small Tokyo apartment, Mr. Kore-eda's fourth film is at once harrowing and tender, an urban horror story with overtones of fairy tale. Restricting himself to the children's point of view, the director creates an almost unbearable sense of dread in the audience; you can't help suspecting that, at every moment, something terrible is about to happen. But at the same time, because the children themselves do not perceive the full terribleness of their situation, the terror is mitigated by a sense of wonder and adventure. The keys to this meticulous and deeply humane film are Mr. Kore-eda's deft camera sense and the remarkable performance of the 12-year-old Mr. Yagira as Akira, the oldest of the four siblings, who must somehow preserve his own innocence while protecting his more vulnerable brother and sisters.  SCOTT    'ONG BAK: THE THAI WARRIOR' Starring Tony Jaa. Directed by Prachya Pinkaew (R, 101 minutes; in Thai, with English subtitles). Martial arts for purists who disdain wirework, computer-generated imagery and digital tweaking. Ting (Mr. Jaa) a country bumpkin trained in the deadly art of Thai Muay, travels to Bangkok to retrieve the stolen head of his village Buddha. Once there, his peaceful disposition is challenged by all manner of thugs and lowlifes. The story is beside the point: like the low-budget Hong Kong action pictures of the 1970's, this movie offers scrappy, ingenious fight choreography. The director is so enamored of some sequences that he treats himself -- and the audience -- to instant replays.  SCOTT    'POOH'S HEFFALUMP MOVIE' With the voices of Jim Cummings, John Fiedler and Kyle Stanger. Directed by Frank Nissen. (G, 63 minutes). In A.A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories, Piglet once thought he had seen a heffalump, but it was really just Pooh with a honey jar stuck on his head. In this adorable animated film, he and the other animals finally encounter the real thing. And it (Lumpy the baby heffalump) is too cute for words, largely thanks to the endearing voice and infectious laugh of 8-year-old Kyle Stanger. The plot involves Roo capturing Lumpy (who thinks a visit to the Roo's part of Hundred Acre Wood sounds like a fine game) and Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore and company learning that Heffalumps aren't scary at all. There is a dash of child-pleasing animated slapstick, a few nice Carly Simon songs and a crucial lesson about the dangers of misjudging people just because they are different from you.  GATES    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, and directed by the cult favorite Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amélie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet possesses a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.  DARGIS    'THE WEDDING DATE' Starring Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney. Directed by Clare Kilner (PG-13, 90 minutes). Ms. Messing stars as Kat Ellis, a New Yorker en route to London for her younger half-sister's wedding. Since there is no man in Kat's life, she turns to the classified ads for male escorts. In a fantasy worthy of ''Pretty Woman,'' the male prostitute she hires turns out to be a hunk (Mr. Mulroney) with beautiful manners and a degree in comparative literature from Brown. Both stars are highly appealing, despite a shaky script. After rowdy parties in London, everyone heads for the glorious English countryside for family-bonding activities. ''The Wedding Date'' proves that there is nothing inherently magical about a group of adults frolicking on a lawn with an old pop-music hit in the background. What charms it does have would be far more enjoyable if the movie weren't so in love with its own supposed cuteness.  GATES    'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.  SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.

Barbez, a New York band, pushes sultry cabaret vocals and the violin and accordion of tango toward skewed extremes; its repertory includes songs by Weill and the Residents. Tomorrow night at 9; cover is free, with a $10 minimum.  PARELES    *DAVID BROMBERG, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Times Square, (212)840-2824 and Count Basie Theater, 99 Monmouth Street, Red Bank, N.J., (732)842-9000. David Bromberg can play just about anything with strings -- guitar, dobro, mandolin, fiddle -- and his knowledge of American music spans blues, bluegrass, country and rock. He also has a gift for elaborate verbal riffs that turn his long-suffering blues into comedy. In recent years, Mr. Bromberg has cut back on touring to become a builder and dealer of American-made violins, making this appearance a rare one. At Town Hall tonight at 8; tickets are $30 to $55. At Count Basie Theater tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25 to $50.  PARELES    THE CONCERT FOR DARFUR, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. A benefit for Action Against Hunger, providing relief in the Darfur region of the Sudan, brings together pop-folk (Terre Roche of the Roches), blues-rock (Halley DeVestern, who sang with the revived Big Brother and the Holding Company), world music (Steve Gorn playing the Indian flute, the bansuri), gospel (the Broadway Inspirational Voices) and more. Sunday night at 6; tickets are $12 in advance, $15 Sunday.  PARELES    *DJ CAMEO, Supreme Trading, 213 North Eighth Street, near Roebling Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)560-0951. This British D.J. is the host of what should be one of the best President's Day Weekend parties: a night devoted to the ferocious, London-based beats-and-rhymes genre known (among other things) as grime. DJ Cameo is the host of \\"Pirate Sessions,\\" the Sunday afternoon grime show on the digital radio station BBC 1Xtra. Expect to hear some of the tracks showcased on the excellent new grime compilation \\"Run the Road\\" (Vice), due out in America on March 8; the CD includes Dizzee Rascal and the Streets alongside emerging grime M.C.'s like Kano and Shystie. Sunday night at 11, with MC Deadly Crisis, DJ Dinesh and Greg Poole; free.  KELEFA SANNEH    *DJ HELL, Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)268-9477. This German D.J. and producer loves to push techno in two directions at once: he sees no reason that a severe, minimalist beat experiment needn't sit alongside an exuberant, maximalist new-wave rant. His new album (credited simply to Hell) is \\"NY Muscle\\" (International Deejay Gigolo), an unabashedly ridiculous but nevertheless engrossing CD full of hypnotic rhythm tracks and over-the-top vocals -- robots trying to sound like divas and vice versa. Sunday night after 11 (and long into Monday morning -- DJ Hell isn't scheduled to play until 3:15), with Savas Pascalidis, Mount Sims DJ Unknown, Terry Francis, Eddie Richards and more; tickets are $20 in advance, $25 at the door.  SANNEH    *FELIX DA HOUSECAT, Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)804-8708. His new-wavey 2004 album, \\"Devin Dazzle & the Neon Fever\\" (Emperor Norton), was something of a disappointment: his continuing obsession with the sights and sounds of 1980's nightlife is starting to seem like a joke in search of a punchline. Still, he remains one of the country's most reliably entertaining D.J.'s, and at this party you can expect the usual: a casual set full of robotic dance tracks and vocal-driven originals. Tomorrow night after 10; admission is $25 before midnight, $30 thereafter.  SANNEH    THE FUNK BROTHERS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. One of Motown Records' secrets was the studio band that backed the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, the Four Tops and virtually everyone else on the label in its 1960's heyday. After getting belated recognition with the documentary \\"Standing in the Shadows of Motown,\\" the surviving members have stayed together to tour with guest singers, still knocking out those indelible beats and hooks. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $45.  PARELES    *JIMMIE DALE GILMORE, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. Jimmie Dale Gilmore was a member of the primordial West Texas songwriters' alliance, the Flatlanders, before embarking on a solo career of songs filled with tenderness and down-home mysticism. Sunday night at 9:30; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 at the door  PARELES    SANDRA LUNA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155. The Argentine singer Sandra Luna is devoted to the imperious tragedy of the tango in all its generations: from old romantic songs in classic style, to Astor Piazzolla's modernist tango nuevo, to new songs infused with jazz. Her album \\"Tango Varón\\" (Times Square) was nominated for a Grammy Award. Sunday night at 7; tickets are $20 in advance, $23 Sunday.  PARELES    ILYAS MALAYEV ENSEMBLE/ROSHEL AMIN, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-5400 or (212)545-7536. The Bukharan Jews of Central Asia soaked up music from Persia, Turkey and the Arabic world in the improvisatory pieces called shashmaqam, mastering poetic and musical traditions with Islamic roots. Ilyas Malayev, who performed for stadium-size audiences in Uzbekistan before immigrating to the United States in 1994, plays the tar, the Central Asian lute, and is renowned for his deep knowledge of traditions dating back to the 15th century. Roshel Amin is part of musical dynasty, playing the tanbur, another kind of lute, in the style of his father, the renowned Bukharan musician Neryo Aminov. Tonight at 8; tickets are $26, or $22 for World Music Institute and Symphony Space members, $15 for students.  PARELES    *BUDDY MILLER, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. Last year Buddy Miller, the guitarist and singer who has long been a mainstay of Emmylou Harris's band, released \\"Universal United House of Prayer\\" (New West), a highly personal album of country gospel songs. Singing about devastation and divine mercy, he could sound ornery and awestruck at the same time. Tonight at 8, with Ollabelle opening; tickets are $20.  PARELES    RHETT MILLER, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212)533-2680. As the singer and songwriter with the Old 97's, Rhett Miller turns his travails into twangy, reckless songs. When he plays the songs alone, as he does here, their pain moves closer to the surface, though the resilience remains. Tonight at 7 and 9:30; admission is $18.  PARELES    YOKO ONO AND SEAN LENNON, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. Tonic, the independent-minded haven for improvisation and avant-rock, is trying to stave off closing with a series of benefit concerts. Yoko Ono, who celebrates her 72nd birthday with this concert, has written benevolent pop-rock songs and hooked up with dance producers for remixes, and when John Lennon was alive she let loose vocals on songs like \\"Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\\" that startled or inspired singers on the fringe. She's joined by her son, Sean Lennon, who has worked with downtown, genre-splicing New York bands like Cibo Matto and made his own album as well as backing his mother. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $50.  PARELES    MARIANNE PILLSBURY, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. On her debut album, \\"The Wrong Marianne\\" (www.mariannepillsbury.com), Marianne Pillsbury is as frank as Liz Phair and as tuneful and upbeat as the Go-Go's, dissecting romantic disasters and then bouncing back with light-hearted choruses. Sunday night at 8, with Paranoid Social Club at 10, Johnny 5 at 9 and Cuaxbei at 7; admission is $8.  PARELES    *LUCIA PULIDO, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. Lucia Pulido, a singer from Colombia, has recorded versions of traditional songs that surround her gutsy voice with arrangements for a modern jazz rhythm section and horns and had new ones written for her by Sebastian Cruz, who will be performing with her at this concert. As Susana Baca has done with Afro-Peruvian songs, Ms. Pulido holds on to the rawness of the original melodies while giving them a sophisticated new context. Tonight at 9:30; admission is $15.  PARELES    THE RADIATORS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703. The second-line backbeat of New Orleans funk is the heartbeat of the Radiators, a rock band that has been together since the 1970's. As band members sing about woman trouble and other frustrations, the groove keeps people shimmying. Tomorrow night at 9 and Sunday night at 7; admission is $25.  PARELES    ROBBERS ON HIGH STREET, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. There's a lot of the Beatles, especially their piano-pumping side, in the songs of Robbers on High Street, updated with Elvis Costello's gruffness and a matter-of-fact desperation. Tonight at 9:30, with the Upwelling at 11:30, Bishop Allen at 10:30, the Head Set at 8:30 and God or Julie at 7:30. Admission is $10.  PARELES    *SOUND TRIBE SECTOR NINE, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800. Jam-band fans come to dance; dance-music fans strive for communal utopia. It was inevitable that they would meet, and in the instrumental jam band Sound Tribe Sector Nine they do, as the live musicians embrace the rhythms of drum-and-bass, house and other current dance music. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, with Genetic opening; tickets are $22  PARELES    *RICHIE SPICE, Elite Ark, 900 Sheffield Avenue, at Wortman Avenue, Canarsie, Brooklyn, (718)649-6535. This fiery roots-reggae singer released one of 2004's best reggae albums, \\"Spice in Your Life\\" (www.fifthelementrecords.com). He loves midtempo reggae grooves, but he's a restless singer, by turns sweet and swaggering and sometimes both at once. The album includes his biggest hit, ''Earth a Run Red,'' an exhilarating protest song where Spice decries the hard-knock life ( '''Watch out fi de vampire who will sneak up in the dark/Watch out fi de big-time thief who claim say that dem smart/Stop bringing the crack and the gun, come mash up the youth dem heart'') before arriving at a refrain that makes the apocalypse sound like the world's best party. Sunday night after 10, with Chuck Fenda, Anthony Cruz and Jamesy P; the price of admission is $30 in advance, more at the door .  SANNEH    TAMMY FAYE STARLITE AND THE ANGELS, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue at 27th Street, (212)683-6500. God and country (music) get some raunchy, funny twists in the songs of Tammy Faye Starlite, who keeps mining the comic possibilities of country-singing evangelism. Lately, she has been singing some Loretta Lynn songs, too. Tonight's first set begins at 10; free.  PARELES    THE STRAWBS ACOUSTIC TRIO, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155. The Strawbs, led by David Cousins, were part of the British trad-rock movement of the late 1960's and 1970's, reaching back to modal Celtic melodies and the lore of ancient ballads. This version of the band is unplugged, with Mr. Cousins, Dave Lambert and Brian Willoughby. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 tomorrow.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    RUTH BROWN, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212)308-9455. This rhythm-and-blues legend has weathered one personal disaster after another, but misfortunes that might have silenced a less determined performer have only added dimension to Ms. Brown's already larger-than-life musical personality. Exhibiting a flamboyant showmanship that recalls her peer James Brown, she proudly presents herself as an indomitable member of royalty and stylistic descendant of the Queen of the Blues herself, Dinah Washington. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30, and Sunday night at 8. Cover: $50 tonight and tomorrow; $35 on Sunday; no minimum.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    *BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.  HOLDEN    *BRIAN STOKES MITCHELL, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212)339-4095. With his heroic baritone and dashing stage presence, Brian Stokes Mitchell has been called Broadway's last leading man in the tradition of Alfred Drake and John Raitt. His performances in the revivals of ''Kiss Me Kate'' and ''Man of La Mancha,'' and in City Center's Encores series (''Do Re Mi''), as well as assorted Gershwin tributes, have lent the swashbuckling archetype a modern slant. Glinting through all the heavy lifting are an innate ebullience, a sense of humor and a strain of tenderness. In ''Love/Life,'' his cabaret debut at Feinstein's, traditional Broadway chest-beating is kept to a minimum, except in a commanding version of ''The Impossible Dream'' at the end of the show that rolls through the club like a clap of thunder echoing in the mountains. (Tonight and tomorrow, final performances, at 8:30 and 11, Cover: $60; $40 minimum at the early shows, $30 at the late shows.)  HOLDEN    UTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)570-7189. This imperious, Dietrichesque cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through next weekend, lends the entire nightclub enterprise a German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature, like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    J.D. ALLEN TRIO PLAYS THE MUSIC OF BUTCH MORRIS, Louis 649, 649 East Ninth Street, East Village, (212)673-1190. J.D. Allen, a young tenor saxophonist who has played with Betty Carter, Cindy Blackman, Orrin Evans and others, is doing his part in Butch Morris's monthlong ''Black February'' series of nightly performances. He's playing in most of the large improvising ensembles conducted by Mr. Morris through the month, and he's also playing this weekly gig with his own trio, including Ameen Saleem on bass and Jeremy Clemons on drums. On the music stand will be Mr. Morris's own compositions going back to the 1970's, which graced a number of old David Murray albums. They're powerfully appealing melodies; it's been too long since they've been heard. Tomorrow night at 8 pm; free.  BEN RATLIFF    IGOR BUTMAN ORCHESTRA, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, midtown, (212) 581-3080. The saxophonist Igor Butman occupies a position in Russia roughly comparable to that of Wynton Marsalis here: besides the fact that the two musicians were both born in 1961, he's an adaptable, highly skilled practitioner and jazz's most appealing popularizer there. His brawny post-bop improvisations are crowd-pleasers, and he'll play with his big band, seldom heard over here. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30; minimum, $10.  RATLIFF    *BILL CHARLAP TRIO, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500. For about eight years running, Mr. Charlap has had a steady trio with the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Kenny Washington; his performances have become extraordinary displays of discipline and improvisation -- the wonders of an organized, creative mind. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $10 to $150.  RATLIFF    JOHN HICKS TRIO, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue South, Manhattan, (212) 885-7125. Notes bunch up in John Hicks's piano chords. They're always filling his fists, and he keeps a few fingers agitatedly moving around within the chords, keeping a bebop pulsation constant through the wall of sound. He wears time loosely, letting himself fall behind the beat; his ideas scramble around to become realized, and he makes thick, heavyweight brocades of post-Coltrane jazz. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:45; cover charge is $15.  RATLIFF    JAVON JACKSON QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. A member of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in their later days, the saxophonist Javon Jackson has made a number of records in the last decade that experiment with repertory, going outside all the usual jazz songbooks. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $25.  RATLIFF    *JORGE BEN JOR, SOB's, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212)243-4940. When the great Brazilian singer-songwriter Jorge Ben Jor slipped into disco rhythms in the late 70's and 80's, it fit him perfectly, and he's still there. He breaks up his chugging electric-guitar rhythms into sharp, syncopated patterns close to those of Nile Rodgers of Chic, and his percussionists play samba-school rhythms around the central driving pulse. Live, he keeps the party going, fusing tunes or scratching out a new rhythm-guitar line as soon as the last song has stopped. He'll likely play new music from a new album, \\"Reactivus Amor Est\\" (Universal Brasil), his best work in ages. Tomorrow at 9 and midnight; cover charge is $30 in advance, more at the door.  RATLIFF    JANE MONHEIT, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592. Ms. Monheit is one of the most popular new jazz singers, and though her choice of material sometimes dips into schmaltz, she wields great control over her petite voice and a way of injecting contemporary speech rhythms into her sung lines that are true, honest and contemporary. Sets through Sunday night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $35; minimum, $5.  RATLIFF    *BUTCH MORRIS, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, between Metropolitan Avenue and North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934; www.zebuloncafeconcert.com; Belt Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)563-0487; Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, East Village, (212)614-0505. Butch Morris has set up performances every night during February; he's calling it ''Black February,'' and this month officially celebrates 20 years of Mr. Morris's ''conductions,'' performances in which he conducts groups of improvisers, jazz or otherwise, with his own language of signals and baton movements. It's fun to watch, and he has a strong sense of humor and beauty. He's playing with different ensembles each night, and here's the weekend schedule: with Butchlandband at Zebulon, tonight at 10 and midnight; free; with the Butch Morris Emyoueseyesee Ensemble tomorrow at 4 p.m. at the Belt Theater; admission is $10; with the New York Skyscraper Ensemble Sunday at 5 and 6 p.m., at Bowery Poetry Club; admission is $12. Check his Web site, www.conduction.us, for further information on these and other performances.  RATLIFF    *DAFNIS PRIETO QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Dafnis Prieto, the young Cuban jazz drummer, arrived in the United States about five years ago and was quickly hired by all kinds of bands. The essence of his style is his collation of various Afro-Cuban percussion sounds -- from old religious music to modern -- within one set of trap drums. His playing is infernally complicated, and infernally precise; the blizzard of accents he throws into any pattern have their place as surely as pixels in a computer image. He is also a gifted composer. In his own work, rearranged danzons jostle against experiments in meter and harmony; his music switches between smoothly cushioned rhythms and spiky ones. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.  RATLIFF    ROSWELL RUDD AND MALICOOL, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway at 95th Street, Upper West Side, (212)864-5400. The trombonist Roswell Rudd has a gregarious, rabble-rousing sound; but he did his homework a long time ago, looking for ways to unite all kinds of music, especially New Orleans and bop and free. Recently he collaborated with musicians from Mali, including the notable kora player Toumani Diabate, on the album ''Malicool'' (Sunnyside); here he presents a New York version of the music with New York's resident kora master, Mamadou Diabate. Tonight at 8 p.m.; tickets are $26; members, $22; students, $15.  RATLIFF    CAROL SLOANE AND THE NORMAN SIMMONS QUINTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595. Carol Sloane is a veteran jazz singer and a shrewd one, with restraint and serenity among her virtues; the pianist Norman Simmons is a master accompanist to people like her. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge, $30; minimums, $10 at the tables, $5 at the bar.  RATLIFF    *CECIL TAYLOR BIG BAND, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, midtown, (212)582-2121. Cecil Taylor, at 75 seemingly as vigorous as ever, has built the art of his pianism on technique and stamina in equal measure; his music avoids the narrative of song in favor of a vatic musical free verse full of clustered chords and flashing figures. (It is notated, though: you'll see a lot of sheet music.) Above all he is a great pianist, and you hear that intermittently in the dense swirl of his 16-piece big band. These affairs over the last decade or so have been wild, boisterous nights. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $32.50; minimum, $10.  RATLIFF    CHARLES TOLLIVER BIG BAND, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. The trumpeter Charles Tolliver left behind a worthwhile trail of music in the 1970's, writing and playing post-bop with a new complexity, recording on the independent label Strata-East. Over the last few years he has become a presence in the New York clubs again. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, $20 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    *VILLAGE VANGUARD 70th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. The best jazz club in New York is throwing itself a party this week, to celebrate 70 years in business, by booking some of the best and most-loved groups in jazz, all of whom claim the club as their regular New York venue. Check out the top-shelf weekend lineup: Tonight, the guitarist Jim Hall's duo; tomorrow, the Heath Brothers, with brothers Jimmy, Percy and Tootie Heath; Sunday night, the pianist Bill Charlap's trio. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11 p.m., with an 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25; minimum, $10.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'ARIANNA IN CRETA' A seldom-performed opera from Handel's prime becomes sung drama at the Gotham Chamber Opera, thanks to the director Christopher Alden, but the lasting impression is of talented young singers flinging themselves headlong into their music, throwing caution (and concern about sounding pretty) to the winds. Katherine Rohrer spews out notes like water from a fire hydrant as Teseo (Theseus), the teenage Greek general; Caroline Worra, as Arianna (Ariadne), gets to use her free, slightly metallic voice in a diva turn; Hanan Alattar and Jennifer Hines bend genders as a soprano boy and a contralto girl; and Neal Goren conducts an energetic, throaty reading in the pit. Tonight at 7:30, Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212)279-4200. Tickets: $30 to $60.  ANNE MIDGETTE    BEIJING OPERA COMPANY OF HUBEI PROVINCE It seemed a few years ago, largely on the strength of the epochal presentation of ''The Peony Pavilion'' by the Lincoln Center Festival, that Chinese Opera was gathering momentum in New York. But the boomlet has receded, so this appearance by a native company in classic fare, ''Monkey King Attacks White Bone Demon,'' is especially welcome. May the Year of the Rooster bring more. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Sold out.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    'LA BOHÈME' It's been some time since the Metropolitan Opera's crowd-pleasing production of Puccini's ''Bohème'' has held much interest for adventurous opera buffs. But this season's revival offers an impressive and intriguing cast. The golden-voiced coloratura soprano Ruth Ann Swenson continues her exploration of the rich lyric soprano repertory as she sings the role of Mimi, with the hardy tenor Roberto Aronica as Rodolfo. The vibrant soprano Patricia Racette sings Musetta, with the robust baritone Dwayne Croft as her off-again, on-again boyfriend Marcello. Daniel Oren conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Sold out, but returns may be be available at the box office.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    *'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' Jonathan Miller's 1998 production, now directed by Robin Guarino, has the virtue of letting Mozart's music and Da Ponte's libretto work their magic unhindered. But that can't happen if the casting and chemistry aren't right. The Met has assembled a youthful cast that has everything -- good looks, vocal and dramatic agility and the energy and alertness necessary to bring to life this score's vivid ensembles. The principals are John Releya as Figaro; Andrea Rost as Susanna; Jossie Pérez as Cherubino; Mariusz Kwiecien as the Count and Janice Watson as the Countess. James Levine conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Sold out, but returns may be available at the box office.  ALLAN KOZINN    'NABUCCO' The Metropolitan Opera's revival of Verdi's ''Nabucco'' this year promises a few bigger guns than last year's production. James Levine will conduct. Maria Guleghina sings Abigaille, and Nikolai Putilin takes the title role. Patriotism is in the air, and for many, patriotism is what ''Nabucco'' is all about. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $145 and $215.  BERNARD HOLLAND    Classical    BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. Tonight brings works by Falla, Debussy and Dvorak performed by Jan Vogler (cello), Mira Wang (violin) and Simone Dinnerstein (piano). Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon, Isidore Cohen, the former violinist of the Beaux-Arts Trio, will be joined by Aaron Boyd (violin), Maurycy Banaszek (viola) and Priscilla E. Lee (cello) for Haydn's string quartet arrangement of his own magnificent ''Seven Last Words of Christ.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $25.  JEREMY EICHLER    RICHARD GOODE This distinguished American pianist seems to have emerged whole from a period of injury and frustration and continues his progress with a recital at Carnegie Hall. The program reflects Mr. Goode's serious and reflective music mind: the Bach E-minor Partita, Schoenberg's Six Little Piano Pieces, the Beethoven Sonata, Op. 109, and, most interesting from a musician known for his concentration on German music, the first book of Debussy's Preludes. Sunday night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $23 to $87.  HOLLAND    MANHATTAN SCHOOL OF MUSIC PHILHARMONIA It has been a big week for student orchestras in New York. With ensembles from the Juilliard School and Mannes College already having displayed their wares, the Manhattan School completes the hat trick. Jeffrey Milarsky, a conductor who has made a name for himself in new-music circles, reverts here to the first half of the 20th century, leading Copland's ''Appalachian Spring'' Suite, Nielsen's Clarinet Concerto (with Mariko Sudo as soloist) and ''La Mer,'' by Debussy. Tonight at 8, Manhattan School of Music, Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (917)493-4428. Free.  OESTREICH    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM ARTISTS IN CONCERT Tonight the Metropolitan Museum of Art's resident chamber ensemble of excellent musicians, either young in fact or young in spirit, presents the second of three concerts this season at the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, a wonderfully intimate hale for chamber music. Picking up with a series focus on recent music from Eastern Europe and Russia, the ensemble offers Arvo Pärt's Adagio for Piano Trio and Alfred Schnittke's Piano Quintet. There are also works by Schubert and Mendelssohn. The cellist Edward Arron, the artistic director of the series, is joined by Jennifer Frautschi and Laura Frautschi (violins), Colin Jacobsen (violin and viola), Nicholas Cords (viola) and Andrew Armstrong (piano). Tonight at 7, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $20.  TOMMASINI    NANCARROW FESTIVAL The music of Conlon Nancarrow has been getting a varied if not thorough exploration this season at the Miller Theater, where a four-part festival began in October. The final installment, performed by the energetic new-music ensemble, Alarm Will Sound, includes the American premiere of the composer's ''Three Movements,'' as well as the Piece for Small Orchestra No. 1 and a handful of the Player Piano Studies. Also on the program is Gyorgy Ligeti's Piano Concerto and two Studies for piano (one in both a standard piano and a player piano version), as well as works by Charles Ives and Jelly Roll Morton. Tomorrow night at 8, at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $20, $12 for students.  KOZINN    PEOPLES' SYMPHONY CONCERTS This venerable organization presents top-tier artists and ensembles at remarkably affordable prices. This weekend is a case in point with two prominent chamber ensembles on the schedule, each performing for about the price of a movie ticket. Tomorrow Musicians from Marlboro, a group culled from ranks of the prestigious summer festival, juxtaposes two Mozart string quintets (K. 174 and K. 516) with Hindemith's ''Melancholie.'' And on Sunday the Tokyo String Quartet offers a program of repertory staples it should pull off well: Beethoven's Quartet Op. 18, No. 6, Mendelssohn's early Quartet Op. 12 and Ravel's Quartet. Tomorrow night at 8, Washington Irving High School, 40 Irving Place, at 16th Street; Sunday at 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)586-4680. Tickets: $9 tomorrow; $9 to $18 on Sunday, with limited availability.  EICHLER    ANDRÉ WATTS This pianist is playing a three-concert series at the Metropolitan Museum this season. In the first, in November, he performed in a chamber ensemble; for the third, in April, he plans to give an illustrated talk on a Beethoven Sonata. But the most promising of the three is the solo program he is performing tomorrow -- a concert similar to one he gave at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in November. On the program are Haydn's Sonata No. 58 in C , Mozart's Rondo in D (K. 485), Schubert's ''Klavierstücke'' (D. 946), Debussy's ''Estampes,'' a group of Liszt works, and selections from ''Musica Ricercata,'' a 1951 suite by the great contemporary Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $35.

Her work will be shown in a free exhibition through Feb. 28. Gallery hours 2 to 8 p.m. daily. Furman Gallery, Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5600.  JENNIFER DUNNING    AKIM FUNK BUDDHA The ever-exuberant Mr. Buddha specializes in dance-theater that combines unblinking stillness, storytelling, tap and Mongolian throat-singing. He adds martial arts, breakdancing, beat-boxing and Japanese, Zulu and urban English talk to the mix in his new ''Amazulu: Dance as a Weapon: The Hip-Hop Circus -- Part I.'' Tonight and tomorrow at 10 p.m.; Sunday at 5:30 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)475-7710 or www.lamamaorg. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    *BRENDA BUFFALINO BASH The red-hot mama of American tap-dancing, also known as a scholar and advocate in a half-century career in tap, will present a program of retrospective and new work, performed with guests. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Fashion Institute of Technology, Katie Murphy Amphitheater, Seventh Avenue and 27th Street (entrance between Seventh and Eighth Avenues), Chelsea, (646)230-9564. Tickets: $20.  DUNNING    'BUTTER MELTS AWAY MY LETTERS' Choreographed by Stephanie Rafferty and conceived and directed by Gian Marco Lo Forte, this theater-dance piece visits a group of young runaways to New York City who cannot quite shrug off the past. Tonight and tomorrow (and Thursday through next Saturday) at 8 p.m.; Sunday (and next Sunday) at 2:30 and 8 p.m. La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710.

DUNNING    'IF THE SHOE FITS' This theater-dance piece also uses visual art, video, clown techniques, baking and vacuuming to explore the internalization of fairy tales, created in a collaboration that includes a credit for hair design. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m., Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (718) 381-4074.

The multimedia production journeys to a heaven-like world where the truly innocent eternally reside. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village,(212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.  JACK ANDERSON    *NEW YORK CITY BALLET Susan Stroman's hit ''Double Feature'' returns to the City Ballet repertory this weekend at all performances. You could quibble that the first act, a would-be ballet called ''The Blue Necklace,'' reveals the perils of crossover choreography. The second act, ''Makin' Whoopee!'' is pure silly pleasure, a silent-movie style comedy that at one point sends what appear to be thousands of brides and a scene-stealing dog speeding across the stage. Don't ask. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570 or www.nycballet.com. Tickets: $30 to $83. The company will also present a ''Family Insights'' talk, designed for children 8 and older, tomorrow from 12:45 to 1:30 p.m. Rose Building, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-4074. Tickets: $8.  DUNNING    *ROYAL BALLET SCHOOL See the Sibleys and Dowells of the future in this program danced by young performers from the renowned English academy, in a program featuring Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Monotones II,'' excerpts from Ashton's ''Fille Mal Gardée'' and Petipa's ''Raymonda,'' and choreography by Kirk Peterson, Robert Hill and Paul Boyd. The program is part of an exchange with the ABT Studio Company, which will dance in London in early April. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212)992-8484. Tickets: $32; $12 for students.  DUNNING    SECOND ANNUAL FOLK FEET Brooklyn-based traditional dance groups will perform in a free program of tap, hoofing, ballet and folk dance from Panama, Brazil, Greece, Bangladesh, Puerto Rico, Yemen, Senegal and Mali. Sunday from 2 to 7 p.m. (free workshops will be offered from 5:30 to 7 p.m.), Whitman Theater, Brooklyn College, Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, (718) 625-0080.  DUNNING    BILL SHANNON Mr. Shannon will perform, on crutches, with Step Fénze Crew in ''Sketchy,'' described as a living documentary of street-inspired movement that includes breaking, popping, house and freestyling. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)255-5793. Tickets: $15; $12 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    *TAKE DANCE COMPANY Founded by Takehiro Ueyama, a sleepily charismatic former Paul Taylor dancer, this new modern-dance company will present dances by Mr. Ueyama and Kazuko Hirabayashi. Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street between Houston and Prince Streets, Manhattan (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $20; $15 for students.  DUNNING    TORONTO DANCE THEATER The company is one of Canada's liveliest modern-dance troupes and Christopher House, its artistic director, is a choreographer who can be both brainy and playful. His latest creation is ''Sly Verb,'' an evening-long piece to music by Phil Strong that explores the sense of touch and the politics of the gaze. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800. Tickets: $38.  ANDERSON    *VISION COLLABORATION NIGHTS This mixed-media series features dancers, improvisational performers and choreographers who work with experimental jazz.

Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 5 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue at Ninth Street, Manhattan, (212)477-5288. Tickets: $20.  DUNNING    *MOENO WAKAMATSU AND MANA HASHIMOTO Ms. Hashimoto, who is known as a founding performer with Treaders in the Snow, and Ms. Wakamatsu, an architect turned dancer, will present ''Jutaikokuchi2 (Annunciation),'' a piece based on the biblical scene of the annunciation. Tonight at 8. Cave Gallery, 58 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)388-6780. Tickets: $10.  DUNNING    *CATHY WEIS PROJECTS Ms. Weis's nutty imagination and humor combine, in her dance and video pieces, to create art that has been described as rough-edged magic. High technology is not her bag. Instead, her work has a wonderfully home-made look. She will perform her new ''Electric Haiku: Calm as Custard'' with a cast of downtown dance and performance art stars, among them Scott Heron, Diane Madden and Jennifer Miller. Tonight and tomorrow (and Wednesday through next Saturday) at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, Manhattan, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org. Tickets: $25.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    'CONTEMPORARY VOICES: WORKS FROM THE UBS ART COLLECTION.' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, through April 25. What's wrong with this picture? The Museum of Modern Art, the most visionary museum of the 20th century, is inaugurating the temporary-exhibition galleries in its 21st-century home with an exhibition of gifts from a corporate collection. It is an ambitious, carefully selected corporate collection, but that doesn't keep the ensemble from feeling corporate, monotonous and by the book. The 40 (of 64) works given or promised to the Modern are nearly all by white male artists, and they are all already represented in the collection. There's nothing wrong with the individual works by artists like Philip Guston, Jasper Johns and Vija Celmins that won't be cured by integrating them into the Modern's collection, but the ensemble effect is dispiriting. With an emphasis on a narrow swath of the 1980's mainstream, the show feels like an excessively edited letter in a bottle from an art world that no longer exists. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students; children under 16 and accompanied by an adult, free. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m.  ROBERTA SMITH    'RUTH DUCKWORTH, MODERNIST SCULPTOR,' Museum of Arts and Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535, through April 3. A sculptor whose basic medium is clay, Ms. Duckworth makes everything from tiny, delicate vessels to monumental outdoor sculptures. Though her work fits in -- but not too neatly -- with the modernist tradition, her eye has roamed everywhere, resulting in a bewildering variety of styles and influences, from Brancusi to a beef bone found in her soup. Sometimes the influences combine awkwardly, making her work seem a little strained and quirky, but often enough her venturesomeness pays off, producing images of eloquence and power. Hours: Daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursdays: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $6 for 65+ and students. Thursdays from 6 to 8 p.m. is pay what you wish.  GRACE GLUECK    *'FROM FILIPPO LIPPI TO PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA: FRA CARNEVALE AND THE MAKING OF A RENAISSANCE MASTER,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 1. The Italian Renaissance artist-priest known as Fra Carnevale was an art-world somebody in his day but a shadowy figure to modern historians, known primarily for two extraordinary paintings of tiny figures in fantastic architectural settings. Both paintings are in this intricate think-piece of a show that tries to reconstruct his career by bringing his known paintings together. At the same time, it uses his work, along with that of major figures like Filippo Lippi and Piero della Francesca, to explore larger ideas about self-created professional identity in a cultural epoch far more diverse than it is sometimes thought to have been. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65+, $10; students, $7.  HOLLAND COTTER    'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718)638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was one of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  KEN JOHNSON    'IMAGES OF DON QUIXOTE: THE ART OF ILLUSTRATION AND PRINTMAKING,' the Hispanic Society of America, 613 West 155th Street, Washington Heights, (212)926-2234, through March 5. A few years back, a poll of international writers voted ''Don Quixote'' the greatest book of all time. This year Cervantes's novel is four centuries old, and the Hispanic Society of America is celebrating the occasion with this exhibition of illustrations of the story printed from the 17th through 20th centuries. Despite its small size, the show demonstrates how attitudes toward the book changed in different eras, from raucous comedy to Romantic tragedy. And in designs by artists like John Vanderbank, Fragonard and Gustave Doré, there are fascinating images and ideas to consider. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 4 p.m. Free.  COTTER    Galleries: 57th Street    ROBERT GOODNOUGH, Katharina Rich Perlow, 41 East 57th Street, (212)644-7171, through March 3. Mr. Goodnough hobnobbed with De Kooning, Pollock and other New York avant-gardists in the 1940's and 50's, but his signature compositions of clustered triangles and trapezoids are more a rejuvenation of late Cubism than a variant of Abstract Expressionism. This show of medium-size pictures dating from 1972 to 2004 demonstrates the range of moods -- from meditative to agitated -- that he has coaxed out of his restricted vocabulary.  JOHNSON    'LEON POLK SMITH: FORMS AND FUNCTIONS,' Joan T. Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212)397-6780, through March 5. Spaces and their boundaries fascinated this hard-edge abstractionist (1906-1996) and in this show of his biomorphic paintings from the 1950's his elegantly calculated contrivance of one space impinging on another pleasingly asks the eye to tease out figure-ground relationships. In ''Over Easy,'' a large, partly heart-shaped figure of mauve thrusts on to a black ground at an angle; or is it the curvy black space that cuts into the aggressor? Smith's clean, flat surfaces, each restricted to two colors, are shown with examples of sleek, minimal contoured furniture by front-line designers of the period, Charles and Ray Eames and Isamu Noguchi among them. The biomorphic shapes of the furniture and their colors play nicely off Smith's smart, snappy formats.  GLUECK    'VIEW EIGHT: A FEW DOMESTIC OBJECTS INTERROGATE A FEW WORKS OF ART,' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212)752-2929, through Feb. 26. This canny show of artworks and objects of design includes Josiah McElheny's curvy mirrored coffee table bearing mirrored blobby objects; beautiful blobby ceramic sculptures by Ken Price; delicate, biomorphic hanging lights by Lionel Theodore Dean; a twisted, retro-futuristic orange bench by Sachio Hihara; and, like the nightmare that domestic utopianism tries to insulate us from, one of Lee Bontecou's early, scarily militaristic reliefs.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    RALPH GOINGS, Louis K. Meisel, 141 Prince Street, (212)677-1340, through Feb. 26. A must for fans of Photorealism, vintage trucks and classic diners, this show presents three signature works by one of the best of the original Photorealist painters: old pickup trucks in parking lots copied from photographs with Vermeerish tenderness in 1970 and 71. Four lovingly rendered views of diner interiors and industrial coffee-making machines from the early 90's round out the exhibition.  JOHNSON    'WHO IS THE PROTAGONIST?' Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, (212)625-9224, through Feb. 26. This engaging exhibition about approaches to storytelling includes a life-size space station interior handmade by Lisi Raskin; a Modernist theater environment with a mysterious sci-fi video called ''Moon Colony'' by Ohad Meromi, the show's organizer; a short, strange sci-fi story written by Halsey Rodman; a storyboard for a film about a father and his young son by Guy Ben-Ner; and a Pop-Cubist head of cut and painted paper by Ryan Johnson.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    GUY BEN-NER: 'WILD BOY,' Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212)727-3323, through Feb. 26. Two short films by Israel's representative to the 2005 Venice Biennale charmingly spoof quasi-scientific documentary film-making. Made entirely at home, \\"Wild Boy\\" is about a feral child (played by the artist's young son) who is captured, cleaned-up and trained by a researcher played by Mr. Ben-Ner. Another film that follows the fortunes of a family of ostriches played by the artist and his family in ridiculous costumes has a perfect anthropomorphising voice-over.  JOHNSON    T.J. WILCOX: 'GARLANDS,' Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-7100, through Feb. 26. The 21 short and very short films in this beautiful show, looped in \\"garlands\\" on six continuously running projectors are triggered by personal memories, family photographs, a news photo, the name of a Japanese doll. Each is as deft as a quick sketch or bit of haiku, a compressed, elegiac meditation on the fragile, ephemeral nature of life as reflected in the gossamer nature of the moving image itself.  SMITH    CECILY BROWN, Gagosian, 555 West 24th Street, (212)741-1111, through Feb. 26. Because it was a blend of Abstract Expressionist style and pornographic imagery that first drew the limelight to Ms. Brown, sensational things are expected of her. She disappoints by being merely good, as she is in her new work. With their all-over fields of splintery and squiggly gestures in nicely coordinated colors, her paintings based on landscape motifs are visually engaging, but they want some more adventurous approaches to form and imagery.  JOHNSON    SARAH ANNE JOHNSON: 'TREE PLANTING,' Julie Saul Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through March 12. This unusually impressive solo debut recounts the coming-of-age ritual of Canada's tree-planting summer camps through an unusually affecting mixture of real-life photographs and set-up photographs. Some images show actual young vigorous people on the brink of adulthood working and playing hard. In others, stocky little dolls, made by the artist, revel in equally fake woodland settings, revealing the childlike innocence their real counterparts are trying to outgrow.  SMITH    KNUT ASDAM: 'FILTER CITY,' Gasser & Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212)807-9494, through Feb. 19. This Norwegian artist who has exhibited extensively in Europe presents a slow, enigmatic, 21-minute film about two young women -- one small and white, the other tall and black -- who, between long pauses, emit oracular, world-weary utterances about social issues and obscure personal concerns. It is well produced and nice to watch, though it borders inadvertently on a parody of pretentious avant-garde filmmaking.  JOHNSON    SANTE D'ORAZIO: 'PAM: AMERICAN ICON,' Stellan Holm, 524 West 24th Street, (212) 627-7444, through March 5. Pamela Anderson -- yes, that Pamela Anderson -- in all her pneumatic, mostly unclothed glory is the subject of large and surrealistically vivid photographs that were originally commissioned but not published by Playboy magazine. Students: discuss criteria for judging the value -- aesthetic and otherwise -- of these artworks.  JOHNSON    JOHN LURIE, Roebling Hall, 606 West 26th Street, (212)929-8180, through Feb. 26. The stream-of-consciousness notational ink drawings and radiant gouaches of the musician John Lurie have precedents in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat and William Wegman's early Conceptual drawings and maybe the cartoons of Roz Chast, but they have their own sense of wiry line and texture, wordplay, sexual bluntness and radiant color.  SMITH    'WORK ON PAPER,' Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3335, through Feb. 26. Highlights of this lively exhibition of things made on or of paper by more than 20 artists include a huge woodblock print by Mel Kendrick; Magic Realist ball point drawings of odd wooden structures by Billy Malone; John Pilson's video sequence of different hands drawing pigs; and Juliana Ellman's funny small painting of inflatable furniture going over a waterfall.  JOHNSON    'RUGS FROM AFGHANISTAN,' Esso Gallery and Books, 531 West 26th Street, (212)560-9728, through March 5. So-called traditional art is a constantly updated mirror of current events, and this is certainly true of weaving in Afghanistan. Working on commission in the 1970's, Afghan women embroidered designs by the Italian conceptual artist Alghiero Boetti (1940-1994) of world maps reflecting shifts in the balance of power among nation-states. While this project was in progress, Afghanistan itself was traumatized by a Soviet invasion that inspired the invention of a genre of \\"war carpets,\\" incorporating images of guns, tanks and war-planes. The fascinating show at Esso includes both types, as well as imaginative hybrids of the two, in a cross-cultural merging of media, styles and ideas that is a model for the way history works.  COTTER    Other Galleries    MATTHEW ANTEZZO, Maccarone, 45 Canal Street, (212)431-4977, through March 13. Among works by the artist known for deadpan copies of art magazine ads are nondescript penciled copies of photographs of feminist heroines like Bella Abzug and Gloria Steinem; copies in pencil of news photographs of American Indian protest events that took place in 1975; and a painting of an ancient statue of Diogenes of Sinope titled ''Cynic.'' What it all means could keep an undergraduate seminar busy for some time.  JOHNSON    Last Chance    'ALMOST,' Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea(212) 366-4774, closing tomorrow. Including works by James Casebere, Neo Rauch, Cindy Sherman, Sherrie Levine and 18 others, this suggestive theme show studies artworks in which something seems to be \\"almost\\" something else, as in Loretta Lux's digitally massaged photograph of a beautiful child, Sylvie Fleury's chromed bronze cast of a Goodyear tire and Cardiff and Miller's video of a burning house. Don't miss Corinna Schnitt's video portrait of a wealthy couple talking about their unbelievably perfect life.  JOHNSON    GÜNTER BRUS: 'DIRTY EMBELLISHMENTS,' Mike Weiss, 520 West 24th Street, (212) 691-6899, closing tomorrow. If you have only a vague idea of the sorts of things this Viennese Actionist did in the 1960s to get himself thrown in jail, you should see the fascinating compilation of films and recorded performances on view here along with recent quaintly transgressive expressionist drawings. The earliest films mix documentation and abstraction to surprisingly evocative effect; later, strictly documentary films of the artist's extremist performances are both repulsive and riveting.  JOHNSON    NATARAJ SHARMA, Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)989-7074, closing tomorrow. The first New York solo exhibition of this Indian painter who has exhibited internationally is too diverse to give a clear picture of what he is about, but the best works have an intriguing allegorical resonance. They are made in a neat and orderly style combining Pop, photo-based realism and hints of Indian traditionalism. Most impressive is the large picture in which a naked man peeps into a temple filled with an semiabstract orgy of interpenetrating pink bodies.

The past always catches up with you","excerpt":"blood is thicker than water; be careful what you wish for. These are among the stale-but-true bromides that are acknowledged by the title character in Donald Margulies's sincere but doggedly unsurprising new play about the midlife crisis of a suddenly successful novelist (Adam Arkin). While this comic drama is steeped in an admirably humble and often touching spirit of acceptance, it seldom does what Mr. Margulies has achieved repeatedly before: make the familiar seem fresh. Polly Draper and Ari Graynor stand out in an excellent cast, smoothly directed by Daniel Sullivan (2:20). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.

Heard not so long ago issuing from the plus-size form of Edna Turnblad in the musical ''Hairspray,'' Mr. Fierstein's voice is one of the most distinctive in theater, variously evoking a kazoo, a congested saxophone, wind in a bottle and echoes from a crypt. It is, in a way, its own multicolored show. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to Mr. Leveaux's abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $100.  BRANTLEY    +'GOOD VIBRATIONS' Even those who believe that everything on this planet has a purpose may at first have trouble justifying the existence of ''Good Vibrations,'' the singing headache that manages to purge all catchiness from the surpassingly catchy hits of the Beach Boys. But audience members strong enough to sit through this rickety jukebox of a show will discover that the production, directed and choreographed by John Carrafa, does have a reason to be. ''Good Vibrations'' sacrifices itself to make all other musicals on Broadway look good. As the show's washboard-stomached performers smile, wriggle and squeak with the desperation of wet young things hung out to dry, you feel their pain. It is unlikely, however, to be more acute than yours (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $76 to $101; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets are available at the box office on the day of the show.  BRANTLEY    +'LITTLE WOMEN' Sutton Foster never merely walks when she can scamper in this perky, sketchy adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of a Civil War-era New England girlhood. Portraying Jo the tomboy, Ms. Foster creates a dizzyingly hyperkinetic creature who, were she living in the 21st century, would probably be on Ritalin. Ms. Foster (a Tony winner for ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'') shows a gift for fresh, comic line readings. But her energy is often less infectious than exhausting. The same can be said of the show, directed by Susan H. Schulman and featuring a book by Allan Knee, with songs by Jason Howland and Mindi Dickstein. Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members, who include the mellow-voiced Maureen McGovern, mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of the American Girl series of dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $100.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    +'BELFAST BLUES' The ''Belfast Blues'' of Geraldine Hughes's solo show aren't the kind you'd expect. Yes, the ''troubles'' between Roman Catholics and Protestants that have roiled Northern Ireland for decades do cast an emotional shadow over this heartfelt and funny if unexceptional stage memoir, descriptively subtitled ''one wee girl's story about family, war, Jesus and Hollywood.'' But Ms. Hughes's title more directly refers to her big, inquisitive and exceptionally expressive eyes, which helped secure that wee girl a ticket to a happier life. ''Belfast Blues,'' which recounts her experience growing up amid poverty and violence in Belfast in the 1970's and 80's, does not bring any groundbreaking insights to familiar territory. But Ms. Hughes is a bright, inviting presence, and the surprising agent of her deliverance from the troubled atmosphere of her youth gives the show a modestly refreshing twist (1:25). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $45; a limited number of $20 student rush tickets are available at the box office one hour before the performance.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' In this stunningly powerful production, an intriguing balance arises between Lopakhin, the bourgeois former serf, and the aristocratic family that owns the cherry orchard and whose fortunes are all but dried up. The landowner Lyubov Ranevskaya (Petronia Paley), returning penniless from her life abroad, is as elegant as she is self-delusional. Against her beauty and her dignity, Lopakhin (Wendell Pierce), the archetype of the small-minded arriviste, is a hard man to like. But this production brings out their shared past in subtle but forceful gestures that complicate the audience's sympathies (2:00). Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25.  CAMPBELL ROBERTSON    'COUNSELLOR-AT-LAW' Entertainment in abundance radiates from the Peccadillo Theater Company's new production of the old Elmer Rice drama ''Counsellor-at-Law.'' Starring the Tony Award-winning John Rubinstein, ''Counsellor-at-Law'' is a drama that throbs with New York life and brims with touchstones of another time, like ''George White's Scandals'' and the Court of General Sessions. But it also retains relevance to ambition and success in the 21st century. It has a hero worth rooting for, a healthy dose of sacred and profane love, some sharp jabs at class difference, villains who merit a hearty hiss and plenty of New York attitude and humor (2:45). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $55; $20 student rush tickets available at the box office 15 minutes before the performance.  LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    +'SABINA' Once a forgotten ghost in the annals of psychoanalysis, Sabina Spielrein is proving to have surprising staying power. A patient of Carl Jung and an acquaintance of Sigmund Freud who ultimately became a psychoanalyst herself, Spielrein has a history that has provided material for two movies and two plays. The first of these was Willy Holtzman's ''Sabina,'' first produced by Primary Stages in 1996 and now in revival as part of the company's 20th-anniversary season. The new production, directed by Ethan McSweeny, is hampered by an unsatisfactory performance from Marin Ireland in the title role. But the history of Spielrein's relationships with the founder of psychoanalysis and his protégé turned apostate is nonetheless engrossing. It provides a provocative window into the much-studied relationship between Freud and Jung. Peter Strauss gives an admirably understated performance as a paternalistic Freud, and Victor Slezak, as Jung, gives persuasive dramatic life to a now-mythic figure. (2:15). Primary Stages, at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays though Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    'SHYLOCK' Deconstructing Shakespeare is a dangerous sport; it's impossible to be more imaginative or clever than the playwright himself, even if you are Harold Bloom. Gareth Armstrong gives it a game try, but ''Shylock,'' his 80-minute dissertation on the evolution of one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters, although deftly performed, is no exception. While his pocket synopses of anti-Semitism, Elizabethan England, Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' and even a Baedeker of famous actors' renditions of Shylock are edifying, they are not sufficiently enlightening or entertaining. The most riveting lines of Mr. Armstrong's monologue belong to Shakespeare himself (1:35). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55; a limited number of $20 student/senior rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance.  PHOEBE HOBAN    +'SLEEPING BEAUTY' Trust a British ''Sleeping Beauty'' to pivot on a fairy's flatulence. Yes, that surefire laugh trigger in old Blighty plays an unexpectedly large role in Rufus Norris's murky new version of the familiar fairy tale for the Young Vic Theater Company. Mr. Norris, a talented young British director whose Broadway-bound production of ''Festen'' snapped up many London theater awards, isn't interested in pretty pictures. His vigorously staged, grotesquely comic ''Sleeping Beauty,'' which unfolds in smoky darkness beneath a queasy yellow moon, is entirely in tune with the current vogue for teasing out thickets of disturbing subtext in children's literature. The production's eccentric designs accentuate the predominantly eerie air (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 7; tomorrow and Sunday at 1 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $10, $20 and $30.  ISHERWOOD    +'TEXAS HOMOS' Often in theater, the provocativeness of a play's title correlates with quality, and not in a good way. But ''Texas Homos'' is a pleasant exception. The title's tone does serve a purpose: it signals that the language in this show is far filthier than some theatergoers might care for, but the play is artfully constructed and convincingly acted, especially by Reed Birney and Richard Bekins in the central roles. Cecil (Mr. Birney) and Jim Bob (Mr. Bekins) have been caught engaging in gay sex in a police sting at a public restroom in Tyler, Tex. Since one is the town doctor and the other a preacher, and since both have wives and children, this creates more than a few problems. ''Texas Homos'' is not really about gay men at all. It is about everyone who has a secret life, and the nightmare that envelops such people once they are discovered. Mr. Birney's portrait of desperation and defiance feels dead on, and so does Mr. Bekins's of resignation and surrender (2:00). June Havoc Theater, Abingdon Theater Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-4444. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 3. Tickets: $25.  NEIL GENZLINGER    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as standup existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. This monologue, which runs just over an hour and requires minimal stagecraft, is as unassuming in its means as it is astonishing in its impact. It's one of those treasured nights in the theater -- treasured nights anywhere, for that matter -- that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Mr. Eno and his performer, the actor James Urbaniak, hereby reinvent that seemingly moribund theatrical genre, the solo show. They are immeasurably aided by the work of the director Hal Brooks. Mr. Eno's voice, or the voice of the narrator/protagonist/master of ceremonies played by Mr. Urbaniak, is alternately lyrical and affectless, ecstatic and flat, sardonic and sincere. Standup-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative: Mr. Eno might be called a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation. Let's try that again, minus the conditional: Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets; $45.  ISHERWOOD    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' This lovably inconsequential, entirely adorable new musical brings to the stage the culture's current mania for celebrating that most revered of American virtues, the will to victory. A mock spelling bee, it pokes serious fun at its twitchy tween contestants -- in the loopy spirit of the movies ''Waiting for Guffman'' and ''Best in Show'' -- but also pays affectionate tribute to these quirky young spelling titans. William Finn's nimble, upbeat score provides the emotional underpinning for Rachel Sheinkin's more satirical -- indeed often riotously funny -- book. The director James Lapine, Mr. Finn's collaborator on ''Falsettos,'' is also in impeccable form, managing to transform into virtues two of the theater's most reliable pitfalls, namely audience participation and the usually ghastly conceit of adult actors' playing kids (1:45). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $75.  ISHERWOOD    'WASTED (THE MYSTERY/HISTORY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND HOW IT GOT THAT WAY)' In ''Wasted,'' the Irondale Ensemble Project tries to answer a very difficult question: How do you make a play about the history of the public school system in American without being terribly boring? While they came up with a number of solutions, none were satisfactory. History is reduced to good guys and bad guys, who both talk in slogans: should school teach kids to think for themselves or prepare them for the workforce? The decline of the school system is told simply as a story of dark conspiracies motivated by corporate greed. In the end, you get the sense that this show is made by people who have spent little time reflecting on the ideas of the other side (2:00). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $25; $15 for seniors, students and New York City Public School teachers; on Thursdays pay what you can afford.  JASON ZINOMAN    Off Off Broadway    'THE CONFESSIONS OF PUNCH AND JUDY' The anarchist Punch and his wife, Judy, have been beating each other senseless for centuries, but while the famously warring married couple is usually performed by puppets, two real-life actors do the quarreling in ''The Confessions of Punch and Judy,'' a rigorously performed modern update with a surplus of energy and a deficit of direction. Ker Wells and Tannis Kowalchuk, who wrote the drama with the director Raymond Bobgan, play the pair in this pedestrian production, which mixes mime, ballroom dance, first-person monologues, puppetry and naturalistic acting. The play has few original thematic or design ideas and never reinvents the stock characters in an interesting way. In the end, it has no insight that you won't learn later this year in the revival of Edward Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Sundays at 7 p.m. Tickets: $15.  ZINOMAN    'DAY OF RECKONING' This play about the anarchist and labor reformer Lucy Parsons is unevenly paced and clumsily staged, but it has this saving grace: unlike some other theatrical efforts associated with Black History Month, it is not shallow hero worship. Parsons was a decidedly flawed hero, and Melody Cooper, the playwright, leaves those flaws in plain sight. As a young woman, Parsons, played by Ms. Cooper, called herself Lucy Gonzalez and tried to pass as Mexican and American Indian, chafing at any suggestion that she was black. And in her militant-labor phase, with her white husband, Albert, she exhorted followers, ''Learn to use explosives.'' When the Parsonses' domestic bliss is shattered by the Haymarket Riot of 1886, Lucy loses her bearings, and her son pays an appalling price. Ms. Cooper's recounting of this fascinating life could benefit from a large infusion of understatement, but still, Parsons's story is one that deserves to be told, especially at a time when those with radical ideas are again under intense scrutiny (1:50). All Stars Project's Performing Arts and Education Center, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)941-1234. Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $15.  GENZLINGER    'THE FLID SHOW' With the drug Vioxx making headlines because of its recent recall over adverse side effects, Richard Willett's play ''The Flid Show'' gains an unsettling topicality. The play traces the history of Thalidomide, the sleeping pill widely distributed in Europe in the late 1950's and early 60's that caused birth defects when taken by pregnant women. Mat Fraser, a seasoned and charismatic British actor who was himself a ''Thalidomide baby,'' stars as Duncan, a lounge singer coming to grips with the anger and resentment fueled by his lifelong struggles. In Mr. Willett's fanciful dramatic scheme -- borrowed from a certain Dickens holiday favorite, as he acknowledges -- Duncan's psychological scars are healed by a series of ghostly visitors who sweep him through time and space. The documentary aspects of the play are absorbing and often poignant (particularly Amy Staats' monologue as a bereaved Belgian mother), but Duncan's personal story, centering on his rocky romance with a doctor and a reconciliation, in spirit at least, with his dead mother, is crudely drawn and clichéd. The director Eliza Beckwith's production is also on the clunky side, with most of the acting not up to the standard set by Mr. Fraser in the central role (2:15). Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101. Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $15; $30 for a special benefit performance on Feb. 24.  ISHERWOOD    Last Chance    +'THE HOUSE OF BERNARDA ALBA' The role of Bernarda Alba has not changed in this production: she is still the tyrannical widowed mother of five daughters who are burning to free themselves from her stifling house. But here it's Poncia (Joanne Camp), the maid, who sets the tone. Poncia's world-weariness instills the play with an earthy, prosaic feel rather than a poetic one. Gone is the passion, and gone, too, is the terror when the tragic consequences of Bernarda's tyranny are revealed. Gone, in other words, is the heat that permeates the play. In its place is a comfy warmth, a fireside instead of an inferno (1:45). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50 for tomorrow evening and Sunday; matinee tomorrow, $40.  ROBERTSON    *'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege, in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Arliss Howard and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination (1:05). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.  BRANTLEY    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'ALIENS OF THE DEEP' Directed by James Cameron and Steven Quale. (G, 48 minutes). When the director James Cameron proclaimed himself ''king of the world'' on winning the Oscar for ''Titanic,'' who knew that he also had designs on the rest of the solar system? His newest film, ''Aliens of the Deep,'' is a grandiose hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy that begins on our planet's ocean floor and ends many miles under the ice crust that covers Europa, the second moon of Jupiter. The movie's sneaky transition from undersea documentary to speculative fantasy of a journey yet to be undertaken is so seamless that you could easily mistake the last portion of the film for the record of an actual space voyage. Mr. Cameron's theory, supported by astrobiologists, is that the life forms found at the deepest levels of the ocean where no light from the sun penetrates may hold clues to the nature of possible life in outer space. Filmed in Imax 3-D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'ASSISTED LIVING' Starring Michael Bonsignore and Maggie Riley. Directed by Elliot Greenebaum. (No rating, 77 minutes). As nursing homes go, Meadow View, the site of this hard-headed comedy that feels like a documentary, is a far cry from the hellholes we sometimes read about, where the elderly are dumped and treated like prisoners. The rooms are clean and the staff efficient. Life there is viewed through the institution's scruffy 27-year-old janitor (Mr. Bonsignore) who regularly sneaks off to smoke pot, is careless about punctuality, and plays affectionate pranks on the residents to relieve his boredom. The wisp of a plot follows Todd's relationship with a patient (Ms. Riley) suffering from early Alzheimer's disease. ''Assisted Living'' may be a comedy, but its images of physical frailty are inescapably unsettling.  HOLDEN    'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone -- two times when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie, where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, that preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'BOOGEYMAN' Starring Barry Watson. Directed by Stephen Kay (PG-13, 86 minutes). There are a lot of close-ups of doorknobs and water faucets in Mr. Kay's would-be horror film. There is a supernaturally speedy killing accomplished with heavy-duty plastic wrap. There is frequent whooshing and rapid camera movement. Despite all of that, it isn't scary. Mr. Watson, of ''Seventh Heaven,'' plays Tim, a grown man who has been afraid of the boogeyman ever since he was 8, when something creepy sucked his father into a closet and out of this life. After his mother's death, Tim vows to spend a night in his childhood home to allay his fears, but, sure enough, the boogeyman is back and after him and everyone he cares about (well, an uncle and two girlfriends). The house is very creaky; so is the movie.  ANITA GATES    'COACH CARTER' Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown, Robert Ri'chard, Rick Gonzalez, Nana Gbewonyo and Antwon Tanner. Directed by Thomas Carter (PG-13, 137 minutes). In this solid, unsurprising inspirational-coach drama, Mr. Jackson plays Ken Carter, who returns to his old high school in the tough Northern California city of Richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners, both on and off the court. Based on a true story, the movie combines sports-picture suspense with heroic-educator uplift when Carter, dismayed that his players are slipping academically, padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season. Mr. Carter (the director, not related to the coach) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism, which are bolstered by the hip-hop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members, especially Mr. Brown as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities, Ashanti as his girlfriend, and Mr. Gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime.  A.O. SCOTT    *'HEAD-ON' Starring Birol Unel, Sibel Kekilli, Catrin Striebeck and Guven Kirac. Directed by Fatih Akin (Not rated, 118 minutes). In German and Turkish, with English subtitles. Love doesn't just hurt in the jagged German romance ''Head-On''; it cuts and bleeds and even kills. A story about a lonely man and a still-lonelier woman fighting against their worlds and what often seems like their own best interests, the film has caused a stir in Germany for the murky, troubling light it sheds on the lives of the country's Turkish immigrants. Its popularity made it a fleeting social phenomenon and a minor cultural footnote. But it doesn't explain why this film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of this very young year. One of the truisms about romances, even those shaded pitch black and set to banging rock music, is that you have to fall in love with the characters when they're falling for each other. It takes a long time for Cahit (Mr. Unel) and Sibel (Ms. Kekilli) to get inside each other's heads, much less anywhere else, but it doesn't take us long to care about these two perfectly imperfect beings.  DARGIS    'HIDE AND SEEK' Starring Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, Famke Janssen, Elisabeth Shue, Amy Irving, Dylan Baker and Melissa Leo. Directed by John Polson. (R, 105 minutes). In the downbeat, sufficiently unsettling ''Hide and Seek,'' Mr. De Niro plays a New York City shrink, David, who's married to a somnolent type (Ms. Irving), whose love for their daughter, Emily (Ms. Fanning), can't disguise her unhappiness. Soon after the story starts, violence descends on the family, and David and Emily move to the country for some healing. Once there, things go from lousy to worse, as Emily starts staring blankly into the surrounding woods and palling around with a sinister invisible friend called Charlie. Blood drips into the story; then it pours. One of the most gifted child actors around, Ms. Fanning has both chops and a preternaturally intense screen presence; even when you don't believe the setup, you buy what she is selling. That's a good thing when it comes to this horror-thriller hybrid, which was written by Ari Schlossberg and needs all the help it can get from its actors.  DARGIS    *'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller, based on fact, performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage that it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered into the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed in ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a hundred-day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.  HOLDEN    'IN GOOD COMPANY' Starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (PG-13, 106 minutes). This gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture, a site of our leading blood sport. Mostly, though, the movie is about men. The two men at the story's engaging center are Carter Duryea (Mr. Grace), a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of Sports America. The man whom Carter is meant to make redundant is the 51-year-old Dan Foreman, a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone. Dan has a picture-perfect family and is the kind of unabashedly old-fashioned masculine type that Mr. Quaid has been slow-cooking to perfection over the years and which, on American screens at least, has lately gone missing.  DARGIS    'LOST EMBRACE' Starring Daniel Hendler. Directed by Daniel Burman (not rated, 100 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). Set in a shabby Buenos Aires shopping mall, this antic, melancholy comedy gives a Latin American twist to a story of young, male Jewish identity crisis that will be familiar to fans of Philip Roth, Neil Simon and Woody Allen. Ariel (the fast-moving, nervous-looking Mr. Hendler) is a young man in a hurry, without much of a sense of direction. He carries on an anxious affair with an older woman, pines for his former girlfriend, and fantasizes about emigrating to Poland, from which his family fled two generations before. Mostly, though, he is haunted by the absence of his father, Elias, who abandoned him as a baby to go to Israel to fight in the 1973 war. The film, while busy and diffuse, is also touching and funny, and its modesty and haphazardness are among its charms.  SCOTT    'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr. Wilson).  DARGIS    *'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent interpretation from Mr. Radford and a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that in evoking Velázquez, Rembrandt, Titian and Vermeer immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.  SCOTT    *'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio in 2004.  SCOTT    *'NOBODY KNOWS' Starring Yuya Yagira. . Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda (PG-13, 141 minutes; in Japanese, with English subtitles). Based on the true story of four children abandoned by their mother in a small Tokyo apartment, Mr. Kore-eda's fourth film is at once harrowing and tender, an urban horror story with overtones of fairy tale. Restricting himself to the children's point of view, the director creates an almost unbearable sense of dread in the audience; you can't help suspecting that, at every moment, something terrible is about to happen. But at the same time, because the children themselves do not perceive the full terribleness of their situation, the terror is mitigated by a sense of wonder and adventure. The keys to this meticulous and deeply humane film are Mr. Kore-eda's deft camera sense and the remarkable performance of the 12-year-old Mr. Yagira as Akira, the oldest of the four siblings, who must somehow preserve his own innocence while protecting his more vulnerable brother and sisters.  SCOTT    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou, Gaspard Ulliel, Jean-Pierre Becker, Dominique Bettenfeld, Clovis Cornillac and Marion Cotillard. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, and directed by the cult favorite Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amélie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet possesses a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.  DARGIS    'THE WEDDING DATE' Starring Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney. Directed by Clare Kilner. (PG-13, 90 minutes). Either Ms. Kilner or Dana Fox, her screenwriter, must have adored ''Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' because their new romantic comedy struggles from beginning to end to capture that earlier film's charm and ebullience. Their efforts are largely unsuccessful. Ms. Messing stars as Kat Ellis, a New Yorker en route to London for her younger half-sister's wedding. Since there is no man in Kat's life, she turns to the classified ads for male escorts. In a fantasy worthy of ''Pretty Woman,'' the male prostitute she hires turns out to be a hunk (Mr. Mulroney) with beautiful manners and a degree in comparative literature from Brown. Both stars are highly appealing, despite a shaky script with aphorisms that don't quite deliver. After rowdy parties in London, everyone heads for the glorious English countryside for family-bonding activities. ''The Wedding Date'' proves that there is nothing inherently magical about a group of adults frolicking on a lawn with an old pop-music hit in the background. What charms it does have would be far more enjoyable if the movie weren't so in love with its own supposed cuteness.  GATES.    'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.  SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    APOLLO SUNSHINE, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. The tunefulness of folk-rock and the Beatles goes joyously off the rails in the songs of this Boston band, which tends to get more raucously enthusiastic somewhere around the second verse. Tonight at 9, with Falcon and Brian Bonz opening; admission is $10.  JON PARELES    *NEKO CASE, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. In one of her songs, Neko Case declares, ''I'm a dying breed who still believes, haunted by American dreams.'' Her songs look back to the era when country music addressed death, sin and heartbreak. She sings honky-tonk and torch songs in a voice that's intimate with tragedy and desire. Sunday and Monday nights at 8, with the Sadies sharing the bill; tickets are $20, $18 in advance.  PARELES    C.J. CHENIER, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 576-1155. C.J. Chenier, the son of Clifton Chenier, who was the undisputed king of zydeco, picked up his late father's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band in the 1980's, carrying on the family tradition of bayou dance music laced with blues. Sunday afternoon as part of the Let's Zydeco series, with dance lessons at 1:30 and music at 2; admission is $22.  PARELES    SANDRA COLLINS, Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)807-7780. Ms. Collins tends toward clean, energetic progressive-house tracks, letting misty atmospherics and grand synthesizers glide over precise rhythm tracks. Tomorrow night after 10, with Pete Tong, Eyal Hen and Eddie Lee; admission is $30.  KELEFA SANNEH    *BO DIDDLEY/GENYA RAVAN, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42d Street, (212) 997-4144. When Bo Diddley plays his namesake beat and growls the metaphysical boasts of ''Who Do You Love,'' it's easy to hear the fire and syncopation that made him a rock pioneer. Behind them is a profound education in the blues. Genya Ravan, who sang with the band Ten Wheel Drive and was a pioneering female rock producer, opens the show. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $30 in advance, $35 tomorrow.  PARELES    *THOMAS FEHLMAN, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. Mr. Fehlman, a German producer, has been tinkering with electronic beats since the 1980's. Last year he released ''Lowflow'' (Plug Research), a warm CD full of minimalist pulses and languid breakbeats. Tonight at midnight; admission is $5.  SANNEH    *HEART & SOUL VALENTINE'S CONCERT, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)247-0200. This is the kind of concert where the audience seems likely to outperform the performers. Not that there's anything wrong with the veteran R&B acts scheduled to appear. The lineup includes Harold Melvin's Blue Notes, Ted Mills (formerly of Blue Magic), Meli'sa Morgan and, perhaps best of all, Staten Island's Force M.D.'s, who were combining smooth R&B with bumpy hip-hop long before it was as popular (or, as the members probably know all too well, as lucrative) as it is today. Still the real thrill will probably be the crowd full of quiet men and notably unquiet women, clutching roses and drinks and -- if the singers are doing their job right -- one another. Tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $45, and you might as well obey the fliers and ''dress to impress.''  SANNEH    *NORMAN JAY, APT, 419 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 414-4245. One of Britain's most popular D.J.'s comes to this cozy (that's a euphemism) nightclub in support of ''Good Times 4'' (Resist), a laid-back double-disc compilation put together by Norman Jay and his brother, Joey Jay. Expect a night of elegant funk, in the broadest sense -- the compilation includes appearances by everyone from the reggae act Zap Pow to the big band overseen by the British electronica producer Matthew Herbert. Tomorrow night after 10, with Citizen Kane; tickets are $8.  SANNEH    KOOL KEITH, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. Kool Keith is hip-hop's definition of multiple personality syndrome, from his days with the Ultramagnetic M.C.'s to more recent metamorphoses into Dr. Octagon and Reverand Tom. Depending on his chosen role, he could be rapping comedy, science or smut. Tonight at 11; tickets are $20.  PARELES    KITKA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155. The drones, dissonances and eerie beauty of Eastern European women's vocal music are the province of Kitka, which has been singing them since 1979. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $20.  PARELES    *JENS LEKMAN/THE IMPOSSIBLE SHAPES/PARKER & LILY/THE SILENT LEAGUE, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. Pop gets twisted in highly personal ways on this quadruple bill. Jens Lekman, a Swedish songwriter whose lyrics are in English, writes wistful ditties that can be wry or depressive. The Impossible Shapes look back to the psychedelically warped pop of the late 1960's, while Parker & Lily sing slowly and quietly about the wreckage of romance in reverberant arrangements. Brian Wilson's legacy shimmers through the songs of the Silent League, which uses a handful of musicians to create grandly expansive orchestral pop. Tomorrow night at 8:30; tickets are $10.  PARELES    LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO QUEEN: NO TIME FOR LOSERS, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212)533-2680. Joe McGinty and his coterie of songwriting connoisseurs first applied themselves to the mixture of hard-rock grandiosity and campy arrogance that was Queen five years ago. They're back at it, with ingenious ways to reinterpret the multitracked splendors of songs like ''Bohemian Rhapsody.'' Tonight at 8; admission is $25. Tomorrow night at 7, admission is $25; tomorrow night at 10:30, admission is $20.  PARELES    *ENRIQUE MORENTE/TOMATITO, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, (212)247-7800. This concert brings together two musicians who combine flamenco's austere tradition of volatile, smoldering passion with the urge to reinvent it. Enrique Morente is a singer who has reached back to old styles and also looked outside the tradition for forms and texts, from a flamenco Mass to rock fusions. This time, he will be in a more traditional format, collaborating with the remarkable guitarist Tomatito, whose improvising vocabulary includes both the deepest flamenco and the harmonies of jazz. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $22 to $69.  PARELES    ERICK MORILLO, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. This veteran house producer may still be best known for producing the huge 1993 hit ''I Like to Move It,'' but since then he's established himself as one of New York's most popular D.J.'s, known for raucous, clattering sets that sometimes gesture toward his love of Latin music. This party celebrates his new release, a four-disc set called ''The 2 Sides of My World'' (Subliminal), which includes both original productions (one track, ''Dance I Said,'' features P. Diddy) and D.J. mixes. Tonight after 10; tickets are $30 in advance, more at the door.  SANNEH    JOHNNY PACHECO/LA SONORA PONCEÑA/TITO ROJAS, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, (212) 239-2672. The flutist and bandleader Johnny Pacheco was born in the Dominican Republic but fell in love early with Afro-Cuban music. He has been a prime mover in New York Latin music since the 1960's, when he helped start Fania Records; he went on to lead the Fania All-Stars, the band that defined New York salsa. La Sonora Ponceña has been one of the cornerstones of Puerto Rican salsa since it was founded in 1954. Its arrangements are at once transparent and propulsive, with pinpoint horns, percussion and keyboard behind ardent vocals; they have urged more than one generation of dancers into motion. Tito Rojas has been one of the leading Puerto Rican salsa singers since the 1980's, making hits with both ballads and dance tunes. Tomorrow night from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.; admission is $25.  PARELES    *SMOKEY AND MIHO/CHOCOLATE GENIUS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. Miho Hatori sang and wrote songs for the funk-rap-lounge band Cibo Matto; Smokey Hormel has played guitar with Tom Waits and Beck. Leading a band, they delve into -- what else? -- Brazilian music. They're joined for this show, a benefit for Tonic, by the percussionist Cyro Baptista and the drummer Billy Martin from Medeski, Martin and Wood. Marc Anthony Thompson, aka Chocolate Genius, writes desolate, telling, unsparing songs about goodbyes, from doomed romances to senile parents. With his husky voice and the backup of Marc Ribot on guitar, he'll have twilit ballads and, probably, some droll comments in between. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $20.  PARELES    MARCO ANTONIO SOLÍS/ANA GABRIEL, Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)465-6741. Latin pop lives for love songs, and this pre-Valentine's Day ''Concierto del Amor'' presents two Mexican ballad singers who wholeheartedly revel in romance. Marco Antonio Solís is suave and earnest in his yearning songs, while Ana Gabriel pours drama into songs with a streak of tragedy. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $59.50 to $99.50.  PARELES    SOULIVE, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236. Soulive is an organ-guitar-drums trio that harks back to the 1950's and 1960's, playing meaty, blues-centered jazz for dancers who like straightforward funk. Lately, it has been hooking up with a little hip-hop. Tonight at 9; tickets are $25.  PARELES    SUPER DIAMOND, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800. A tribute to the songs of Neil Diamond, particularly his triumphal 1970's material. Smirking is optional. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $26.  PARELES    *KEITH SWEAT, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070. For the not-getting-any-younger slow-jam specialist Keith Sweat, every other weekend of the year must be merely preparation for this one -- no matter what else happens (or doesn't happen) in his career, he'll probably always be a big draw around Valentine's Day. Expect an audience full of longtime fans to scream and whoop for a set full of plaintive (but never, ever wimpy) love songs, sung by a man who knows how to find a balance between tenderness and rakishness. Sunday night at 7:30, with Atlantic Starr and Meli'sa Morgan; tickets are $53.50 to $73.50.  SANNEH    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    RUTH BROWN, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212)308-9455. This rhythm-and-blues legend has weathered one personal disaster after another, but misfortunes that might have silenced a less determined performer have only added dimension to Ms. Brown's already larger-than-life musical personality. Exhibiting a flamboyant showmanship that recalls her peer James Brown, she proudly presents herself as an indomitable member of royalty and stylistic descendant of the Queen of the Blues herself, Dinah Washington. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30, and Sunday night at 8. Cover: $50; no minimum.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant red-headed musician and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $42 at 8, with a $15 minimum. (An $80 dinner-and-show package is available.)  HOLDEN    *BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.  HOLDEN    UTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)570-7189. This imperious, Dietrichesque cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through Feb. 26, lends the entire nightclub enterprise a German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature, like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ERIC ALEXANDER QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. A young tenor saxophonist with a beautiful sound, centering in the Coltrane-ish lower-middle register; if he is a little unabashedly entranced by a particular area of jazz's past, around 1955 to 1965, he does well by it. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $25.  BEN RATLIFF    RASHIED ALI QUARTET, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Best known as John Coltrane's drummer in his last few years and his foil on the duet album ''Interstellar Space,'' Mr. Ali has never stopped collaborating with up-and-coming musicians. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    J.D. ALLEN TRIO PLAYS THE MUSIC OF BUTCH MORRIS, Louis, 649 East Ninth Street, at Avenue C, East Village, (212)673-1190. J.D. Allen, an able young tenor saxophonist who has played with Betty Carter, Cindy Blackman, Eric Revis and others, is doing his part in Butch Morris's month-long ''Black February'' series of nightly performances. He's playing in most of the large improvising ensembles conducted by Mr. Morris through the month, and he's also playing this weekly gig with his own trio. On the music stand will be Mr. Morris's own compositions going back to the 1970's, which graced a number of old David Murray albums. They're powerfully appealing melodies; it's been too long since they've been heard. Tomorrow night at 8:30 pm; free admission.  RATLIFF    COOPER-MOORE/WILLIAM PARKER, Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center /LES Gallery, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4080. The multi-instrumentalist Cooper-Moore needs no special context to be understood: he plays as if he is trying to grab the attention of pedestrians on a busy street. He'll play boogie-woogie piano, pushing form into abstraction; stamp out a rhythm with hand percussion; play beautiful ballads with home-made harps, or bark out a blues on the harmonica. This performance celebrates a Cooper-Moore boxed set, on the 50 Miles of Elbow Room label, which includes five seven-inch records and a booklet inside a small cedar box. It includes solo performances by Cooper-Moore and and William Parker on bass, and a duet between the two musicians. Sunday from 3 to 6 p.m; admission is $6.  RATLIFF    GOLD SPARKLE BAND, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue between Metropolitan and North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934. The Gold Sparkle Band has been in New York since the late 80's; it channels the East-Coast jazz avant-garde of the mid-1960's. Sunday night at 10; free admission.  RATLIFF    LEE KONITZ TRIO, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, midtown, (212)581-3080. Lee Konitz, the alto saxophonist, was one of Lennie Tristano's closest associates in the late 1940's and early 50's; that experience left a permanent impression on his subsequent career, in terms of repertory, instrumentation and many other things. Even so, he is as original a player as there is in jazz, with a sound that has remained limpid and innocent and an emphasis on melody that makes him always easy to follow. He plays this weekend with the brothers Ed and George Schuller, on bass and drums. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    JASON LINDNER GROUP, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1073. Jason Lindner, a smart, rhythmic pianist who brings together bop, Cuban and all sorts of progressive influences, has become a regular feature at this club; this particular group includes the bassist Reggie Washington, the drummer Tony Escapa, and as guests, the saxophonist Jimmy Vass and the singer Baba Israel. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.  RATLIFF    SERGIO MENDES, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592. Three decades before Bebel Gilberto could be heard in restaurants all across the country, Sergio Mendes was the populist face of Brazilian music, making albums that souped up bossa nova for international audiences. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $40 at the tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.  RATLIFF    *BUTCH MORRIS, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue between Metropolitan Avenue and North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934; Belt Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 563-0487; Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, East Village, (212)614-0505. Butch Morris has set up performances every night during February; he's calling it ''Black February,'' and this month officially celebrates 20 years of Mr. Morris's ''conductions,'' performances in which he conducts groups of improvisers, jazz or otherwise, with his own language of signals and baton movements. He's playing with different ensembles each night, and here's the weekend schedule: with Butchlandband at Zebulon, tonight at 10 and midnight; free admission; with the 18 piece Free Zone/Sound Infusion Orchestra tomorrow at 4 pm at the Belt Theater; admission is $10; with the New York Skyscraper Ensemble Sunday at 5 and 6 p.m., at Bowery Poetry Club; admission is $12. Check his Web site, www.conduction.us, for further information on these and other performances.  RATLIFF    HOUSTON PERSON QUARTET, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue near 125th Street, Harlem, (212)427-0253. A veteran tenor saxophonist who keeps things pleasurable. His background is in the 1950's, when a good deal of jazz was completely submerged in rhythm and blues, and he is one of the few mainstream jazz performers today who can routinely find access to the deep language of pleasure from that time. Mr. Person has an elastic, sequential solo-building style that links him to Sonny Rollins and occasionally a fat, breathy tone that links him to Ben Webster. Enjoy him. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8:30, 10 and 11:30; cover charge is $20 per set, and there is a one-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    *BEN RILEY'S MONK LEGACY SEPTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, 5th Floor, (212)258-9595. Led by the drummer Ben Riley, who played regularly with Thelonious Monk through the 1960's, this seven-piece band will do something unusual: play new arrangements of Monk material with no pianist. Since Monk's songs bear up beautifully through any number of reinterpretations, and since Mr. Riley is a lovingly sensitive drummer, it should be a worthwhile week. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.  RATLIFF    *JIMMY SCOTT, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, midtown, (212) 582-2121. This singer of sepulchral jazz songs keeps rolling along, with the cracks and crevices in his voice seeming either more authentic or more disturbing, depending on your point of view. But he is also one of the old-school jazz performers who know how to hold audiences tightly from beginning to end. Sets through Sunday night are at 8:30 and 10:30; cover, $35, and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    JOE WILDER WITH MICHAEL WEISS TRIO, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212)885-7125. Mr. Wilder, a marvelous trumpeter who played with big bands in the 1940's and 50's and finally went full time into studio and television work, plays a kind of tabula-rasa swing language: there's very little slang in there to clog the music. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:45; cover charge is $15, and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    BUSTER WILLIAMS QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. Mr. Williams, an agile bassist with a liquid tone, has been setting up bands stocked with the best players in New York. This one includes the saxophonist Steve Wilson, the pianist George Colligan and the drummer Lenny White. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    MATT WILSON'S ARTS AND CRAFTS, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Regardless of who's in his band -- and membership has changed several times over the last few years -- the jazz drummer Matt Wilson is a plenty good enough draw all by himself. Influenced by the late Billy Higgins, among others, Mr. Wilson's style swings with a fairly light touch; but he is fiendishly attentive to what his sidemen are doing, and he uses every bit they give him, playing off their gestures, stoking their furnaces in turn. He has a sense of play that's hard to miss. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, and $20 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'ARIANNA IN CRETA' With first-rate production values as well as musical ones devoted to professional revivals of virtually unknown works, the Gotham Chamber Opera can claim to be the pre-eminent small opera company in New York. This season is practically mainstream by the company's standards as it jumps onto the bandwagon of the current Handel fad with a work from the composer's prime (1734), the first in a planned series of Ariadne-themed operas. The cast includes some notable young singers, Caroline Worra and Hanan Alattar among them; the conductor is the company's founder, Neal Goren; Christopher Alden will direct. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212)279-4200. Tickets: $30 to $60.  ANNE MIDGETTE    'LA BOHÈME' It's been some time since the Metropolitan Opera's crowd-pleasing production of Puccini's ''Bohème'' has held much interest for adventurous opera buffs. But this season's revival offers an impressive and intriguing cast. The golden-voiced coloratura soprano Ruth Ann Swenson continues her exploration of the rich lyric soprano repertory as she sings the role of Mimi, with the hardy tenor Roberto Aronica as Rodolfo. The vibrant soprano Patricia Racette sings Musetta, with the robust baritone Dwayne Croft as her off-again, on-again boyfriend Marcello. Daniel Oren conducts. Tomorrow at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Sold out; returned tickets may be available at the box office.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    Classical Music    AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Leon Botstein and his American Symphony Orchestra keep coming at us with irresistible repertory. Sunday afternoon brings the orchestra's latest adventure into French opera: ''Le Roi Malgré Lui'' by Chabrier. This comedy for the opera stage will be performed at Avery Fisher Hall, and anyone interested in the byways of this strain of opera should try to go -- either for love or just curiosity. Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $53.  BERNARD HOLLAND    BARGEMUSIC There are few better places to hear chamber music in New York than this floating concert hall on the Brooklyn side of the East River. Once a coffee barge, it offers the intimacy that chamber music demands, as well as a wonderful view of lower Manhattan through the bay windows that make up the back wall of the stage. This weekend, Mark Peskanov, the violinst and Bargemusic's executive and artistic director, presides over performances of two Mozart Divertimentos -- those in B flat (K. 287) and D (K. 334). The performers, along with Mr. Peskanov, include Aaron Boyd, violinist; Miranda Sielaff, violist; Eric Jacobsen, cellist; Timothy Cobb, bassist, and Wei-Ping Chou and Brad Gemeinhardt, hornists. Tonight and tomorrow nights at 7:30, and Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083. Tickets: $40; $25 for students.  ALLAN KOZINN    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER Ravel was a big admirer of jazz and couldn't understand why more American classical composers did not integrate it into their music. The composer himself suggested how it might be done in his catchy jazz-tinged Violin Sonata, to be performed at this concert by the fine French violinist Philippe Graffin and the pianist André-Michel Schub. Paul Neubauer (viola) and Gary Hoffman (cello) join for the remainder of the French-themed program, including music by Fauré and Saint-Saens. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875.5788. Tickets: $27.50 to $48.  JEREMY EICHLER    COLUMBIA SINFONIETTA This ambitious group was founded in 2000 to address a perceived dearth of larger scale New York ensembles devoted exclusively to contemporary music. The group closed up shop after one season but it has recently re-formed under its previous director, the conductor and percussionist Jeffrey Milarsky, to pick up where it left off presenting both ''classic'' works of recent decades that are rarely heard in New York, and new compositions. In the former category this weekend will be Messiaen's ''Oiseaux Exotiques,'' an important piece from the mid-1950's that is derived, like so much of the composer's music, from bird songs. Also on the program will be a 1979 percussion work by Michael Finnissy as well as more recent music by Carlos Sánchez-Gutiérrez, David Rakowski and Eric Chasalow. Sunday at 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330. Tickets: $10.  EICHLER    *SHARON ISBIN Guitarists typically build their performances around either solo works, concertos or chamber music. Sharon Isbin, one of the finest guitarists performing now, both technically and interpretively, will draw on all three repertories in her concert on Sunday. She opens with Vivaldi's Concerto in D (RV 93), and closes with a chamber score, the Boccherini Quintet in D (G. 448). Between them, she offers an arrangement by John Duarte of the Albinoni Adagio, Mr. Duarte's own ''Joan Baez Suite'' in its New York premiere, Falla's ''Siete Canciones Populares Españolas'' and Rodrigo's ''Aranjuez ma pensée.'' Ms. Isbin's collaborators include Catherine Cho and Soovin Kim, violinists; Cynthia Phelps, violist; Carter Brey, cellist, and Daniel Druckman, percussionist. Sunday at 3, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212)415-5500. Tickets: $40.  KOZINN    MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE A few seasons ago, Dawn Upshaw joined James Levine and the Met Chamber Ensemble -- players from the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra -- in remarkably sensual, eloquent rendering of Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire.'' Ms. Upshaw returns to sing the work again with Mr. Levine and company in an all-contemporary program that also includes Luigi Dallapiccola's ''Piccola Musica Notturna,'' Elliott Carter's ''Luimen'' and Schoenberg's own chamber arrangement of his Five Pieces (Op. 16). Sunday at 5, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $48 to $64.  KOZINN    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC In his last years with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, an ensemble with a great Mahler tradition, Riccardo Chailly was becoming a formidable Mahlerian. Now, in the first of his two weeks with the New York Philharmonic, an orchestra with its own personal connection to the composer, Mr. Chailly conducts Mahler's Seventh Symphony. And a fuller exposure to Mr. Chailly as a Mahlerian can be had in a recording of the Ninth Symphony with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, released late last year by Decca. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: today, $22 to $74; tomorrow and Tuesday, $25 to $90.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    JOSÉ VAN DAM Both in opera and in the song repertory, the Belgian bass-baritone José Van Dam has been among the most vocally splendid and artistically refined singers of our time. A few seasons back, as Mr. Van Dam turned 60, his voice, understandably, showed signs of decline. But in the last two years he has gained new-found vocal vitality, most recently as Golaud in the Metropolitan Opera's production of Debussy's ''Pelléas et Mélisande.'' At 64 he is singing with uncanny freshness and incomparable artistry. His recital, the first of two programs for Lincoln Center's ''Art of the Song'' series, should be marvelous. With the pianist Maciej Pikulski, he will sing French works by Fauré, Debussy, Massenet, Berlioz and Bizet. (The second program is on Wednesday) Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $48.  TOMMASINI    'GAY VALENTINE MUSIC CELEBRATION' Tomorrow night Canticorum Virtuosi, the nonprofit organization that oversees the activities of two respected area choruses, the New York Virtuoso Singers and the Canticum Novum Singers, presents an elaborate and eclectic concert to honor ''same-sex love and affection,'' to quote the presenters. The distinguished and varied roster of performers includes the composer and pianist David Del Tredici, the Paul Taylor Dance Company, the tenor John Wesley Wright, the Gay Gotham Chorus, the Ambassador Singers of the New York City Gay Men's Chorus, a roster of cabaret performers and Harold Rosenbaum directing the Canticum Novum Singers and the New York Virtuoso Singers. The program is a benefit for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. Tomorrow night at 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-7171. Tickets: $20 to $100.  TOMMASINI    NIKOLAI MEDTNER This Russian pianist and composer, who died in 1951, is no longer a household name, but his passionate supporters during his lifetime included Rachmaninoff, who in 1912 labeled him ''the most talented of all the modern composers.'' Medtner's late-Romantic solo and chamber works are the focus of a program tonight that, with David Dubal as host, features a selection of piano miniatures or ''Skazki'' (''fairytales'') as well as his Piano Quintet in C, among other works. Tonight at 8, Renee Weiler Concert Hall, Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212)242-4770. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and 65+.  EICHLER    ORLANDO CONSORT Among the challenges of performing very old music are, first, figuring out how it went and, second, making it come alive. Both challenges are grist for the mill of this male vocal quartet, founded in 1988 (but recently joined by a new tenor), celebrated for its performances of music written before 1500, and supported by musicologists in preparing varied programs like this weekend's, which includes music from their latest album, devoted to the 15th-century composer Antoine Busnois. Other star composers -- stars, at least, to specialists in this particular area -- are Hayne van Ghizeghem, Walter Lambe and Henry VIII. Tomorrow night at 8, Low Library Rotunda at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $35; $21 for students.  MIDGETTE    TOKYO STRING QUARTET The Tokyo String Quartet is currently in residence at the 92d Street Y, and the theme of the series of concerts it has been performing is immigrant composers. Tomorrow's program consists of the ''Rider'' Quartet from Haydn's Op. 74, Zemlinski's Fourth Quartet and Hanns Eisler's Septet No. 2 with added flute, piccolo, clarinet and bassoon. Viewing Haydn as an immigrant stretches the point. The Op. 74 may have coincided with his famous visits to London, but that is all. Still Haydn is always welcome regardless of passport status. Zemlinski and Eisler, who ended up back in East Germany, are legitimate topics. Tomorrow night at 8, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212)415-5500. Tickets: $35.  HOLLAND    Dance    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance.    BEIJING MODERN DANCE COMPANY A troupe founded in 1995 and one of the principal forces in contemporary Chinese dance makes its New York debut in ''Rear Light,'' an evening-long work to music by Pink Floyd that reflects the struggle of a young Chinese generation to reconcile traditional culture with influences from abroad and a thirst for intellectual freedom. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800. Tickets: $34.  JACK ANDERSON    AKIM FUNK BUDDHA The ever-exuberant Mr. Buddha (or is it Funk Buddha?) specializes in dance-theater that combines unblinking stillness, storytelling, tap and Mongolian throat-singing. He adds martial arts, breakdancing, beat-boxing, and Japanese, Zulu and urban English talk to the mix in his new ''Amazulu: Dance as a Weapon: the Hip-Hop Circus -- Part I.'' Tonight and tomorrow (and next Thursday through Saturday) at 10 p.m.; Sunday (and next Sunday) at 5:30 p.m. La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, west of Second Avenue, Manhattan, (212)475-7710 or www.lamama.org. Tickets: $15.  JENNIFER DUNNING    'BUTTER MELTS AWAY MY LETTERS' Choreographed by Stephanie Rafferty and conceived and directed by Gian Marco Lo Forte, this theater-dance piece visits a group of young runaways to New York City who cannot quite shrug off the past. Tonight and tomorrow (and Thursdays through Saturdays through Feb. 26) at 8 p.m.; Sunday (and Sundays through Feb. 27) at 2:30 and 8 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street west of Second Avenue, Manhattan (212) 475-7710. Tickets: $15; TDF vouchers accepted.  DUNNING    *FLAMENCO FESTIVAL The festival closes with ''Flamenco at the Crossroads,'' in which the dancer Rafaela Carrasco will join traditional and new-style flamenco singers in an exploration of this age-old Gypsy art. Sunday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $22 to $69. And for those who wish to continue the exploration, there is a free series saluting the great Spanish filmmaker Carlos Saura and his flamenco films, many made with Antonio Gades, ending on Feb. 23 with Mr. Saura's classic, all-encompassing ''Flamenco.'' Wednesdays beginning at 6 p.m. Instituto Cervantes, 211-215 East 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)308-7720 or www.cervantes.org.  DUNNING    'I LOVE TANGO' This ''tango musical'' boasts four dancers and live string, bandoneon, piano and vocal music. Tonight (and Thursdays and Fridays through March 25) at 8 p.m.; tomorrow (and Saturdays through March 26) at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays (through March 27) at 4 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718)729-3880 or www.thaliatheatre.org. Tickets: $30; $27 for students and 65+; $25 (on Thursdays).  DUNNING    MARK JARECKE A choreographer who has studied philosophy as well as dance and whose creations often have an architectural quality offers ''Dendron,'' an in-the-round piece during which the audience is free to move around the performance area. Theatergoers are also encouraged to bring portable radios with earphones to savor the shifts in the sound environment by Chris Peck and Jon Moniaci. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at Tenth Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.  ANDERSON    CLEO MACK DANCE PROJECT Ms. Mack and her New Jersey-based company specialize in modern dance that she describes as ''highly choreographed life.'' The program includes new and recent dances that explore emotional states and one in which a 30-foot long skirt is a character. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, Manhattan, (908)561-5454. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    MOISEYEV DANCE COMPANY Russia's most famous folk-dance troupe makes its only New York appearance this season. Founded in 1936 by Igor Moiseyev, who at 98 continues to choreograph, the company is known for its spirited acrobatic dancing, theatrical flair and a repertory of works from Russia and many European and Asian nations. The dancing world travelers also perform American jazz and rock pieces. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, Brooklyn College, near Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, Brooklyn, (718)951-4500. Tickets: $45, $40.  ANDERSON    PARSONS DANCE COMPANY The program includes four modern-dance pieces by David Parsons, a former Paul Taylor star, and music by the Ahn Trio, a group of three Korean-born sisters. Tonight at 8, Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, C.W. Post Campus, Long Island University, Route 25A, Brookville, (516)299-3100 or www.tillescenter.org. Tickets: $38, $50 and $60; $35; $47 and $57 (65+).  DUNNING    ROCHA DANCE THEATER This program of modern-dance choreography by Jenny Rocha and the guest artist Kelli Wicke Davis, explores hidden human behavior, in part to music by Marty Beller. It includes -- we like this -- a piece with interactive newspaper costumes. Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, Manhattan, (212)334-7479. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    THUNDERBIRD AMERICAN INDIAN DANCERS Dances of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Inuit, Hop and Pueblo peoples will be included in this 30th annual Pow-Wow, along with a new modern-dance piece by Tom Pearson, a Creek Cherokee. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 5 p.m., Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue at Tenth Street, Manhattan (212) 254-1109. Tickets: $10; $1 for children under 12 accompanying ticket-bearing adults on Sunday.  DUNNING    'WAVE OF HUMANITY' This four-part, eight-hour dance event, a benefit for tsunami relief efforts, features nearly 40 individuals and companies chosen by nine dance institutions. Participants include Earl Mosley, Amanda Loulaki and Short Mean Lady, Ivy Baldwin Dance, Noemi LaFrance, Clare Byrne, Erica Essner Performance Co-Op, 3rd Rail Dance and House Dance Project. Tonight from 6 to 8 p.m.; 8 to 10 p.m.; 10 to 11:30 p.m., and 11:30 p.m. to 2 a.m., New Dance Space Center, 280 Broadway at Chambers Street, Manhattan, (212)625-8369 ext. 55 or www.dancespacecenter.org. Tickets: $20 (first through third parts); $15 (fourth part); $60 for all four; $100 VIP tickets for all four.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    'CONTEMPORARY VOICES: WORKS FROM THE UBS ART COLLECTION.' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, through April 25. What's wrong with this picture? The Museum of Modern Art, the most visionary museum of the 20th century, is inaugurating the temporary-exhibition galleries in its 21st-century home with an exhibition of gifts from a corporate collection. It is an ambitious, carefully selected corporate collection, but that doesn't keep the ensemble from feeling corporate, monotonous and by-the-book. The 40 (of 64) works given or promised to the Modern are nearly all by white, male artists and they are all already represented in the collection. There's nothing wrong with the individual works by artists like Philip Guston, Jasper Johns and Vija Celmins that won't be cured by integrating them into the Modern's collection, but the ensemble effect is dispiriting. With an emphasis on a narrow swath of the 1980's mainstream, the show feels like an excessively edited letter in a bottle from an art world that no longer exists. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m.  ROBERTA SMITH    'RUTH DUCKWORTH, MODERNIST SCULPTOR,' Museum of Arts and Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535, through April 3. A sculptor whose basic medium is clay, Ms. Duckworth makes everything from tiny, delicate vessels to monumental outdoor sculptures. Though her work fits in -- but not too neatly -- with the modernist tradition, her eye has roamed everywhere, resulting in a bewildering variety of styles and influences, from Brancusi to a beef bone found in her soup. Sometimes the influences combine awkwardly, making her work seem a little strained and quirky, but often enough her venturesomeness pays off, producing images of eloquence and power. Hours: Daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursdays: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $6 for 65+ and students. Thursdays from 6 to 8 p.m. is pay what you wish.  GRACE GLUECK    *'FROM FILIPPO LIPPI TO PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA: FRA CARNEVALE AND THE MAKING OF A RENAISSANCE MASTER,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 1. The Italian Renaissance artist-priest known as Fra Carnevale was an art-world somebody in his day, but a shadowy figure to modern historians, known primarily for two extraordinary paintings of tiny figures in fantastic architectural settings. Both paintings are in this intricate think-piece of a show that tries to reconstruct his career by bringing his known paintings together. At the same time, it uses his work, along with that of major figures like Filippo Lippi and Piero della Francesca, to explore larger ideas about self-created professional identity in a cultural epoch far more diverse than it is sometimes thought to have been. A few of the paintings mustered as evidence are pretty strange; many are glorious. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65+, $10; students, $7.  HOLLAND COTTER    'IMAGES OF DON QUIXOTE: THE ART OF ILLUSTRATION AND PRINTMAKING,' the Hispanic Society of America, 613 West 155th Street, (212)926-2234, through Feb. 20. A few years back, a poll of international writers voted ''Don Quixote'' the greatest book of all time. This year Cervantes's novel is four centuries old, and the Hispanic Society of America is celebrating the occasion with this exhibition of illustrations of the story printed from the 17th through 20th centuries. Despite its small size, the show demonstrates how attitudes toward the book changed in different eras, from raucous comedy to Romantic tragedy. And in designs by artists like John Vanderbank, Fragonard and Gustave Doré, there are fascinating images and ideas to consider. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 4 p.m. Free.  COTTER    'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718)638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was one of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  KEN JOHNSON    Galleries: Uptown    MIQUEL BARCELÓ, C&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212)861-0020, through March 5. Paint as a natural force is the consuming interest of Mr. Barceló, a Spanish artist steeped in a grand realist tradition. His feeling for the past includes an admiration for the lush Spanish still lifes known as bodegónes. But his abstract-figurative use of paint, in thick impasto crusts and slathers, is also indebted to the dense pigment-plus canvases of post-World War II idols like Jackson Pollock, Antoni Tapiès, and Jean Dubuffet. His surfaces are often bulked up with vegetative matter, sand and other materials to suggest natural surfaces like the sea and its inner life.  GLUECK    Galleries: 57th Street    'LEON POLK SMITH: FORMS AND FUNCTIONS,' Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212)397-6780, through March 5. Spaces and their boundaries fascinated this hard-edge abstractionist (1906-1996) and in this show of his biomorphic paintings from the 1950's his elegantly calculated contrivance of one space impinging on another pleasingly asks the eye to tease out figure-ground relationships. In ''Over Easy,'' a large, partly heart-shaped figure of mauve thrusts on to a black ground at an angle; or is it the curvy black space that cuts into the aggressor? Smith's clean, flat surfaces, each restricted to two colors, are shown with examples of sleek, minimal contoured furniture by front-line designers of the period, Charles and Ray Eames and Isamu Noguchi among them. The biomorphic shapes of the furniture and their colors play nicely off Smith's snart, snappy formats.  GLUECK    'VIEW EIGHT: A FEW DOMESTIC OBJECTS INTERROGATE A FEW WORKS OF ART,' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212)752-2929, through Feb. 26. This canny show of artworks and objects of design includes Josiah McElheny's curvy mirrored coffee table bearing mirrored blobby objects; beautiful blobby ceramic sculptures by Ken Price; delicate, biomorphic hanging lights by Lionel Theodore Dean; a twisted, retro-futuristic orange bench by Sachio Hihara; and, like the nightmare that domestic utopianism tries to insulate us from, one of Lee Bontecou's early, scarily militaristic reliefs.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    *'LOG CABIN,' Artists Space,38 Greene Street, (212)226-3970, through Feb. 26. Given the cultural climate, wedding bells won't be playing ''Over the Rainbow'' any time soon, and men and women won't be coming out of the closet and going into the Army. So what can Log Cabin Republicans, gay supporters of the ruling party, be thinking? This is one of the questions posed, however indirectly, by the 33 participants in a snappy, discursive group show that serves as field report on what art with queer identity as a theme is looking like these days. As surveyed by the curator, Jeffrey Uslip, it's looking good and heterogeneous: ambisexual, interracial and multigenerational, though short on lesbian artists, who are making some of the best work anywhere.  COTTER    'WHO IS THE PROTAGONIST?' Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, (212)625-9224, through Feb. 26. This engaging exhibition about approaches to storytelling includes a life-size space station interior handmade by Lisi Raskin; a Modernist theater environment with a mysterious sci-fi video called ''Moon Colony'' by Ohad Meromi, the show's organizer; a short, strange sci-fi story written by Halsey Rodman; a storyboard for a film about a father and his young son by Guy Ben-Ner; and a Pop-Cubist head of cut and painted paper by Ryan Johnson.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    KNUT ASDAM: 'FILTER CITY,' Gasser & Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212)807-9494, through Feb. 19. This Norwegian artist who has exhibited extensively in Europe presents a slow, enigmatic, 21-minute film about two young women -- one small and white, the other tall and black -- who, between long pauses, emit oracular, world-weary utterances about social issues and obscure personal concerns. It is well-produced and nice to watch, though it borders inadvertently on a parody of pretentious avant-garde filmmaking.  JOHNSON    SANTE D'ORAZIO: 'PAM: AMERICAN ICON,' Stellan Holm, 524 West 24th Street, (212) 627-7444, through March 5. Pamela Anderson -- yes, that Pamela Anderson -- in all her pneumatic, mostly unclothed glory is the subject of large and surrealistically vivid photographs that were originally commissioned but not published by Playboy magazine. Students: discuss criteria for judging the value -- aesthetic and otherwise -- of these artworks.  JOHNSON    JOHN LURIE, Roebling Hall, 606 West 26th Street, (212)929-8180, through Feb. 26. The stream-of-consciousness notational ink drawings and radiant gouaches of the musician John Lurie have precedents in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat and William Wegman's early Conceptual drawings and maybe the cartoons of Roz Chast, but they have their own sense of wiry line and texture, wordplay, sexual bluntness and radiant color.  SMITH    NATARAJ SHARMA, Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, (212)989-7074, through Feb. 19. The first New York solo exhibition of this Indian painter who has exhibited internationally is too diverse to give a clear picture of what he is about, but the best works have an intriguing allegorical resonance. They are made in a neat and orderly style combining Pop, photo-based realism and hints of Indian traditionalism. Most impressive is the large picture in which a naked man peeps into a temple filled with an semiabstract orgy of interpenetrating pink bodies.  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    MATTHEW ANTEZZO, Maccarone, 45 Canal Street, (212)431-4977, through March 13. Among works by the artist known for deadpan copies of art magazine ads are nondescript penciled copies of photographs of feminist heroines like Bella Abzug and Gloria Steinem; copies in pencil of news photographs of American Indian protest events that took place in 1975; and a painting of an ancient statue of Diogenes of Sinope titled ''Cynic.'' What it all means could keep an undergraduate seminar busy for some time.  JOHNSON    NEW YORK'S FINEST, Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, through March 5. This exhibition of paintings by 19 mostly young and emerging artists has an eclectic, anarchic spirit. The common ground includes an interest in material, be it the store-bought fabric with which Joe Bradley conjures up a Minimalist seaman, or the Expressionist effusions of Anke Weyer and Wallace Whitney. Variations on a knowing but unjaded Pop-Expressionism prevail, mixed in varying ratios by Katherine Bernhardt, Brendan Cass, Bill Saylor, Carrie Moyer and Josh Smith, who has lately abandoned paper for canvas to good effect. ''Laissez-faire, but mean it!'' might be the collective rallying cry.  SMITH    Last Chance    'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500, closing on Sunday. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphosing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  COTTER    'COMIC GROTESQUE: WIT AND MOCKERY IN GERMAN ART, 1870-1940,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200, closing on Monday. The horrors of World War I are usually credited with inspiring the dark, often scathing humor that was used to comment on and combat some very unfunny developments in Germany in the first four decades of the century. But the Neue Galerie's splendidly multimedia revisionist show takes a broader view. It identifies paintings by Arnold Bocklin from the 1870's as a point of origin and then sweeps forward in a selective yet encompassing manner, touching on painting, poetry, graphic design and popular entertainment. It places artists like Lionel Feininger and Alfred Kubin in context. It culminates in the films of the great Karl Valentin, a star of stage, screen and cabaret who was Germany's Charlie Chaplin. Hours: Saturdays through Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7.  SMITH    CORY ARCANGEL, Team Gallery, 527 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-9219, closing tomorrow. In one of the season's best debuts, the collaboratively inclined Cory Arcangel and his cohorts create quasi-interactive sound and video pieces of startling and subversive beauty by commandeering various electronic or digital staples including music videos, karaoke tunes, video games, the Internet and even a long phone message. The sense that anything man-made is grist for personal expression is exhilarating.  SMITH    'ONE-ARMED BANDIT,' D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)352-9460, closing tomorrow. This three-artist show is notable mainly for its playful installation. Presented in groups of three with each artwork framed by red tape applied to the wall, Polly Apfelbaum's gridded drawings of cartoon blossoms on white velvet, Tony Feher's flattened, glitter-covered found boxes and Joanne Greenbaum's buoyant abstract pictures are displayed in various permutations like slot machine icons.

Mario M. Cuomo's New York State budget involves reductions of more than $300 million in aid to nursing homes. If approved by the state Legislature, this would critically damage geriatric care. I know of no nursing home that would be able to maintain its level of care.   Only 5 percent of the elderly are institutionalized. Like you and me, they would much prefer to spend their last years at home. But illness, often multiple illnesses, gives them no alternative but to seek the round-the-clock comprehensive care available in a nursing home.   For those who work to improve the quality of later life, it is disheartening and shocking to see New York take a step backward in human services and destroy advances in geriatric care.   Legislators must be fiscally responsible, but they should also understand as they prepare to vote on the budget that New York's physically compromised elderly will have no recourse if they are deprived of adequate nursing home care.

The darkness, of course, exists only for the people onstage, since everything that happens after the electricity has gone, in the world of the play, is performed in a blaze of stage lights amid John Lee Beatty's vibrant Pop/Op setting.   Since its New York debut in 1967, with a cast that included Michael Crawford, Lynn Redgrave and Geraldine Page, \\"Black Comedy\\" has had a healthy life in American community and university theaters, and one can see why. It is, for its first half-hour, almost foolproof comically. It not only offers a novel occasion for the eternal gymnastics of elemental farce: people falling down stairs, bumping into doors and furniture and mistakenly groping each other. It also, in showing twittish characters trying to maintain their customary social rituals in a world deprived of visual cues, coaxes the latent absurdity out of those rituals, and even the process of mixing a cocktail courts burlesque disaster. As the evening progresses, though, it requires considerable finesse to disguise the fact that there is something sour at its center.
