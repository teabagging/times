Moroni, Njazidja Is., 11°40′S, 43°16′E. Boundaries: between Madagascar and southeast Africa. Total land area: 838 sq. mi. (2,170 sq km). Coastline: 211 mi. (340 km). Comparative area: slightly more than 12 times size of Washington, D.C. Land use: 35% arable land; 18% permanent crops; 47% other. Major cities: (1980 census) Moroni (capital) 17,267; Mutsamudu 13,000; Fomboni 5,400. PEOPLE Population: 632,948 (July 2003 est.). Nationality: noun—Comoran(s); adjective—Comoran. Ethnic groups: Antalote, Cafre, Makoa, Oimatsaha, Sakalava. Languages: Arabic and French (both official), Shikomoro (a blend of Swahili and Arabic). Religions: 98% Sunni Muslim, 2% Roman Catholic. GOVERNMENT Type: independent republic. Independence: July 6, 1975 (from France). Constitution: Dec. 23, 2001. National holiday: Independence Day, July 6. Heads of Government: Colonel Azali Assoumani, head of state (since Apr. 1999). Structure: executive; bicameral legislature; judiciary. ECONOMY Monetary unit: Comoran franc. Budget: (2001) income: $27.6 mil.; expend.: N.A. GDP: $441 mil., $720 per capita (2002 est.). Chief crops: vanilla, cloves, perfume essences. Natural resources: negligible. Major industries: tourism, perfume distillation. Labor force: 144,500 (1996); 80% agriculture; 20% unemployment (1996). Exports: $16.3 mil. (f.o.b., 2001 est.); vanilla, ylang-ylang, cloves, perfume oils. Imports: $39.8 mil. (f.o.b., 2001 est.); rice and other foodstuffs, consumer goods, petroleum products, cement. Major trading partners: exports: 31% France, 19% U.S., 19% Singapore; imports: 25% France, 17% South Africa, 7% Kenya. Comoros is part of an archipelago composed of four prominent islands (the fourth, Mayotte, is a French dependency) and several smaller islands. Numerous groups from Africa, Europe, and Asia invaded the islands over the centuries. Shirazi Arabs introduced Islam to Comoros around the turn of the 16th century, and the French established colonial rule over the archipelago between 1841 and 1912 and developed a plantation-based economy. The islands remained a French territory until 1961 when political autonomy was granted. Comoros gained independence in 1975. Overthrown by foreign mercenaries in 1975, Pres. Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane returned to power in 1978 and helped establish the country's first constitution. In Nov. 1989 he was assassinated by a small group of rebels who quickly dispersed under pressure from the French government. A new constitution was approved in 1992, and the country's first democratic elections were held in Nov. 1992. An attempt, begun in 1997, by the islands of Anjouan and Moheli to gain independence or at least autonomy led to an army coup in April 1999 and Anjouan's claim of independence in Jan. 2000, a claim he soon renounced. Much of the nation's soil is laden with lava, making it unsuitable for farming, especially on the island of Njazidja (Grand Comore), which is dominated by Mount Kartala, an active volcano. Poor transportation links between the islands and a harsh cyclone season add further to the country's problems. In an effort to end the series of coup attempts (over 20 since 1975), Comoros adopted a new constitution in Dec. 2001, which provides for a rotating presidency among the four islands in four-year terms, as well as a separate president and more autonomy for each of the four islands.

Beauchamp's documentary ''The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,'' the film cuts from Emmett's mother, Mamie Till Mobley, calmly describing her 14-year-old son's mutilation for whistling at a white woman -- his head had been split side to side, and one eye left hanging from its socket -- to a grisly photograph of his corpse. When the movie was shown at the Hamptons International Film Festival last October (it opens at Film Forum in Manhattan on Aug. 17), the sudden appearance of the photograph drew a collective gasp from the audience, followed by audible sobs.    Much has been written recently about how Mr. Beauchamp's ''Untold Story,'' along with the efforts of Till's cousin Simeon Wright and Alvin Sykes of the Emmett Till Justice Campaign, helped to reopen the unsolved 50-year-old case of Till's murder in Money, Miss., leading to the recent exhumation of his body. Less has been said about the role played by the picture that the Jet magazine photographer David Jackson took at Till's funeral, after Ms. Mobley insisted on an open casket. It was published in September 1955, a week before an all-white jury acquitted Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam of the murder","excerpt":"three months later, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus, and later she linked that decision to her shock at seeing the images of Till's brutalized body.    In 1981, Mr. Beauchamp, then 10, stumbled across the photograph in his Baton Rouge, La., home. ''My parents, like many parents, used it as a warning: 'Don't let what happened to Emmett Till happen to you,''' he said. Sixteen years later, he decided to research Till's murder, and carried the photograph with him everywhere. ''I couldn't get the picture out of my head,'' he said. ''That's why I made the film.'' So the story came full circle: decades after the photograph was widely credited with galvanizing the civil rights movement, it inspired a film that could eventually help bring about justice in Till's case. ''You can listen to the story all you like,'' Mr. Beauchamp said. ''But it's the photograph that cuts like a knife.''

In both instances, government officials in New Jersey and elsewhere seized on the most straightforward recommendations. In particular, they paid close attention to suggestions for expanding transportation networks and preserving open space. But all three states were slower to take the association's advice on more complex, sensitive issues like social policy, taxation and urban revitalization. Addressing problems in these areas would require a well-coordinated joint effort on the part of government, business, civic groups  and the housing, education and health care sectors.

Fluxus was never, strictly speaking, a movement at all. It began as the collective spirit of an international group of young artists, writers and musicians in the early 1960's. Those in New York were influenced by John Cage and Marcel Duchamp, and sought anarchic alternatives to Abstract Expressionism and the powerful gallery system that prevailed at the time. Fluxus art ranges from toylike objects made of found materials, to written proposals for projects, to staged \\"events\\" in which little or nothing appears to happen. Basic to Fluxus is a belief in the use of chance in art, in the connection between art and everyday life, and in the creative role of the viewer in making art.
