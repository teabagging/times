Business travelers who rent cars frequently have learned to expect and understand the gaps between prominently advertised rates and what they are ultimately asked to pay. But the delight with which a vacation traveler picks up a subcompact advertised, say, at $69 a week with unlimited mileage can turn to angry shock when the cost at the end of the week proves to be almost twice that.   No auto rental bill is without what many customers call hidden charges, although they will be mentioned on the rental contract, albeit often in fine print. Almost always, for example, you will have to pay for at least as much gasoline as you use, if not for more. In most states, your rental will be subject to sales tax, and you will frequently have to pay a ''drop-off'' charge if you do not return the car to the same station, or at least the same area, where you picked it up.   You will have the option of paying extra for personal accident insurance and for full coverage for collision damage to the car. But if you do not choose the collison-damage option, you may have to put up a substantial deposit before the rental company will entrust the vehicle to your care.

Set in a Venetian hotel, the multi-layered movie is an amalgam of plots, filmmaking styles and effects. Though finally overwhelmed by a preening lassitude, the movie is never less than fascinating, breaking into multi-screen scenarios like Mr. Figgis's 2000 experiment, &quot","excerpt":"Timecode.&quot; Revolving primarily around a film crew making a version of &quot;The Duchess of Malfi,&quot; the film stretches out for long, competitive turns among the actors. In one of the subplots, Mr. Ifans is the charismatic director, and Mr. Schwimmer his scheming producer and right-hand man. The connective thread of the movie is loneliness and secrets — which serve as a function of selfishness. Intriguingly, and perhaps even maddeningly, &quot;Hotel&quot; always seems to be in flux, which is a real achievement. Some may say it's like watching wine age in a bottle, but the movie also offers the sense of the vintage changing from minute to minute.

What was miraculous about him, among other things, was that he painted  nothing, or mostly nothing: a woman reading a letter, or asleep at a table. But he made it seem as if time had nearly stopped in these pictures, and the effect is like slow-motion film: the ordinary suddenly looks extraordinary. Put  another way, Vermeer eternalized moments that we all live, the ones when nothing much is happening, and gave them an almost mystical gravity.         Is this what makes him so popular? Partly, perhaps. The Vermeer show, here at the National Gallery of Art, has been mobbed. People have even lined up out on the street hours before the gallery opened, as if the exhibition were a holiday  sale.

But because of patronage politics, skepticism of ''merit selection'' plans and the difficulties of amending the State Constitution, the outcry following the renomination controversy in the Bronx is unlikely to bring about any dramatic changes quickly.   When Stanley M. Friedman, the Bronx Democratic chairman, blocked the renomination of two Supreme Court justices who between them had served 20 years on the bench, judges throughout New York regarded the move as an ominous precedent. In the absence of scandalous behavior or outright incompetence, renomination had always been a mere formality.

These machine-age artifacts, forgotten for decades, have a small but devoted following. But recent exposure has made them hip, threatening their cult status.\\nDANKESCHON: Last summer in Germany, both Der Spiegel and Manner Vogue published lavishly illustrated articles on McArthur, who died in 1961. Stylists and magazine editors in the United States featured the Art Deco furnishings as props in fashion layouts and in such fall and winter catalogues as Neiman Marcus's. Stuart Parr, the top McArthur furniture dealer in this country, is quick to assert that the furniture is classic and should not be considered trendy. \\"This furniture is timeless, and that's what makes it an icon,\\" said Mr. Parr, whose gallery is in TriBeCa. \\"Just because it shows up in some fashion magazines doesn't mean it's cool all of a sudden. It's been cool for the last 60 years.\\"\\nNUTS AND BOLTS: Unlike other metal furniture, McArthur's has no spot welds. Instead, a complex infrastructure of threaded tension rods lies inside the segmented tubular frame. The tension rods are connected at right angles within the furniture's ring joints. This patented construction allowed easy assembly, gave the frame increased rigidity and made repairs routine.\\nBAUHAUS BUSTER: McArthur's design philosophy was strictly opposed to that of the Bauhaus, the prevailing design esthetic filtering over from Europe. Unlike contemporaries like Le Corbusier and Marcel Breuer -- who advocated sleek, chrome-plated lines -- McArthur chose to work with a lusterless material and emphasized, rather than concealed, his furniture's connecting elements. \\nMILITARY INTELLIGENCE Because aluminum was needed for the construction of airplanes in World War II, it was declared a strategically important material by the United States Government. As a result, most of McArthur's prewar furniture was melted down for the war effort (which explains the furniture's rarity today). Using his expertise in tubular aluminum, McArthur retooled his assembly line in 1941 and manufactured 80 percent of all the seats in American bombers.\\nMAD ABOUT McARTHUR: Valentino, Annie Leibovitz, Bruce Weber, Mick Jagger, Nicole Miller, Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe and Marlene Dietrich.\\nDOES THAT INCLUDE DELIVERY? In June 1993, Sotheby's auctioned a McArthur armchair (made around 1935, in the designer's \\"golden period\\") for $8,050. Six months later, a vanity and chair sold at Christie's for $9,000. \\nFAB FAKES: Classicon, a furniture company in Munich, Germany, that specializes in authorized reproductions, has issued a nine-piece line of McArthur furniture. Prices range from $500 for a side chair to $5,000 for a three-section couch.\\nRENE CHUN THING","excerpt":"Timeless, Trendy or Both?"},{"year":"1944","title":"Themes, principles and timeliness discussed More Than Ever The Book for Today","excerpt":"Timeless, yet forever timely, the Bible holds the promise that a better world is possible."},{"year":"1969","title":"ONCE upon a time there was a kind of music called \\"timeless,\\" but writing it is getting to be old-fashioned today.

For some, an introduction will generate more applause at Shea than any of their accomplishments ever did. For others, particularly Stengel, it will be a return to the glory that once was, even in the national comedy of last place. Ed Kranepool remembers them all, some more than others.

By Bob Dylan. 524 pages. Illustrated by the author. Alfred A. Knopf. $21.95. ''You don't necessarily have to write to be a poet,'' Bob Dylan declared once. ''Some people work in gas stations and they're poets. I don't call myself a poet because I don't like the word. I'm a trapeze artist.'' Like so many of the gnomic, contradictory pronouncements he would make over the years, that statement attests to a decidedly equivocal attitude on Mr. Dylan's part - in this case, toward literature and the whole literary establishment.   Clearly the author of ''Tarantula'' - a melange of surreal nonsequiturs and stream-of-consciousness ramblings vaguely packaged as a novella - had always cherished certain literary ambitions, and over the years he had appropriated literary techniques with the same undiscriminating urgency as he had absorbed various musical styles. While too much was doubtless made of this during the 1960's, when college students routinely wrote theses dissecting his debt to Rimbaud, Celine and Whitman, the fact remains that his early work did help, in those formative years, make people aware of the possibilities of rock-and-roll as a potential forum for serious discussion, as a potential meeting ground for high and popular art.

In the final harried days of campaigning, rivalries within the dominant Shiite conservative religious coalition could cause it to fracture, perhaps helping secular Shiite candidates. They might then have a better chance of leading a coalition and forming the first full-term government to take office under the country's new Constitution. Here are seven leading political figures who could emerge among the leaders, and issues over which they can be expected to bargain as the new government seeks to hold the country together.    Religious Shiites    MOKTADA AL-SADR -- Cleric in early 30's whose militia rebelled against Americans. Major player in main Shiite coalition, but his family and Mr. Hakim's are fierce rivals.    GOALS -- Strong central government","excerpt":"timetable for quick American troop withdrawal.    ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAKIM -- Head of Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, leading party in the main Shiite coalition.    GOALS -- Autonomy for oil-rich south; legal role for Islam; legal use of militias (his party has one, integrated in security forces, that Sunnis accuse of abducting and killing Sunnis); close relations with Iran; purging government of ex-Baathists.    Kurds    JALAL TALABANI (left, in a photo held by a supporter) and MASSOUD BARZANI Leaders of the two main Kurdish parties.    GOALS -- Above all, protecting autonomous status of northern Iraq, which Americans established with air protection in 1991; keeping militia intact; regional control over oil resources; inclusion of Kirkuk, an oil center, in their autonomous region. The Kurds generally oppose any strong legal role for Islam.    Secular Shiites    AHMAD CHALABI -- Deputy prime minister, a former Pentagon favorite. Recently left main Shiite coalition to run on his own.    GOALS -- Purging ex-Baathists from government; autonomy for south. Though aligned in past with Mr. Sadr, is secular and has not sought strong legal role for Islam.    AYAD ALLAWI -- Ex-Baath Party official; was U.S. choice as prime minister after Saddam Hussein's ouster. Attracts moderate voters.    GOALS -- Reversing the purging of Baathists; is expected to try to rid security forces of Shiite militiamen; in past, his allies criticized Iranian interference and were accused of corruption.    Sunni Arabs    TARIK AL-HASHEMI -- Leads Iraqi Islamic Party, centerpiece of the Sunni Arab religious coalition. Strongly opposes autonomous regions, saying they could break up Iraq.    GOALS -- Undoing purging of former Baathists; removing Shiite militiamen from security forces; ending mass arrests in Sunni areas by Americans and Shiite-led government; changing detainee system.    On the Issues, Who's Allied With Whom    KEEP MILITIAS POWERFUL -- Shiite and Kurdish militias are major forces, seen by their groups as a guarantee of their autonomy or power. Some work with Iraq's official security forces -- a source of great tension with Sunnis and others who want strong central rule.    SUPPORT REGIONAL AUTONOMY -- Autonomy is a key issue for Kurds and Shiite religious parties, which recall suppression under Saddam Hussein. Advocates of strong national government resist it.
