Again Frau Niese displays her mature powers as a real woman of the people in a part similar to her rôles in \\"Die Grosse Liebe\\" and \\"Die Blumenfrau von Lindenau.\\" Transformed in an emergency from the independent owner of a laundry business into the pseudo ruler of an imaginary principality, she applies her common sense to cleaning up mismanagement and grafting so effectively that her reforms almost prevent the comic opera revolution which puts her back into her laundry and unites her winsome daughter (Else Elster) with the ex-prince (Herr Doederlein).The substitution of the laundress for the princess is made possible by the striking resemblance between the two women (who \\"really\\" are half-sisters in the story). In her dual part Frau Niese is excellent, and the director, Max Neufeld, makes the best of her abilities. Fräulein Elster acts well, as does Herr Doederlein. The support is capable and the occasional melodies are pleasing. Photography and sound reproduction are clear. Some of the outdoor scenes are charming, and the interior views of the laundry and the castle are interesting. One of the best scenes is located in jail, where a group of revolutionists welcome the laundress with song.Persons not familiar with German are advised to read the program summary in advance.

But their eerie realism was so startling to audiences  a century ago that their viewing often incited panic. In FROM PEEP SHOW TO PALACE: The Birth of American Film (Columbia University, $29.50), David Robinson, a film historian, provides a diligent overview from the moment cinema  was just a flicker in a magic lantern to the golden years between 1893 and 1913, when scientists and technicians laboriously fitted together the \\"pieces in a puzzle\\" and created feature films. Mr. Robinson's chronology is painstakingly  thorough, if at times tedious, and he dissects the various stages of motion picture development with scholarly zeal. His portrayals of the great cinematic innovators Thomas Edison, the Lumiere brothers and Georges Melies provide some vivid accounts of publicity mongering, patent wrangling and ego interference as  the race for notoriety accelerated. But, finally, the book seems to need a slightly more humorous approach to a subject brimming with pratfalls, and leaves the casual reader craving more anecdotes about the personalities that catapulted the entertainment into the pre-eminent American art form.

The story is far closer in spirit to \\"The Member of the Wedding\\" than it is to Ms. Shange's own outspoken \\"For Colored Girls.\\"   At present there is a wandering focus, which is not the case with Ms. Shange's novel. In the book, we see Betsey and her family through the girl's eyes, which are opening to her own possibilities as well as to societal changes as a result of the Supreme Court decision on school desegregation (so movingly dramatized in television's \\"Separate but Equal\\").

This Pathé production, known as \\"With Commander Byrd in America's Polar Triumph,\\" now is on exhibition at Warners' Theatre. It is a subject of unusual interest and the flashes leading up to the starting of the airplane for the North Pole give one a graphic idea of the indomitable courage and the energy of the members of the expedition.Lugging the great airplane across the ice floes is in itself a remarkable undertaking. There are also \\"shots\\" in this feature of the risks taken by the cameramen in filming the efforts of Commander Byrd's men from giant slabs of ice. One is impressed by the dreariness of the place where the group of Americans had to work. Those scenes taken from the airplane during the flight show the difference in the light. These are preceded by views of Commander Byrd's flying machine taken from another airplane.The other presentation at the same theatre is entitled \\"The Devil Horse,\\" and was produced by Hal Roach and directed by Fred Jackman. In it figures that remarkable horse named Rex, which will be remembered as the animal who gained no little fame, for what might be termed a performance, in the film called \\"Rex, the King of Wild Horses.\\" The two other animals, the Killer and the heroine, Lady, are also to be seen in this production.Rex is just as wonderful in \\"The Devil Horse\\" as he was in the other picture. Since he was a colt he has learned to hate Indians, and one can justly say that \\"he gets his men,\\" for the way he gallops after redskins in this picture really looks as if he meant business. He permits nothing to halt him, and when the Indians leap into the river, Rex jumps in after them.There are clever comedy touches in this production. In one instance the young chap who as a boy had looked after Rex thinks he has mastered the horse's wild spirit, but just when this Dave Garson is asking the horse who is master, the animal flings the young man neatly off his back. Later, however, Rex consents to be saddled, and he is even willing to permit Dave to ride him through an Indian camp with two flaming torches on a bar, a feat that is performed to instil fear into the Redskins. The Indians, after several of their number have been slain by Rex, begin to look upon the animal as a supernatural creature, and their wonder is great when Rex manifests affection for Dave.There are some striking outdoor scenes in this film, many of them with different herds of horses. The Killer, the equine villain, is a pinto who rages against animals of one color.The direction of this picture, even though one may look upon the performances of the animals as a reaction to something not included in the story, is admirable. Rex really appears to rage as he stamps with his hoofs, and the snorting Killer strikes one as a menace only second to the Indians.

I would like to visit Kiska and Attu in the Aleutian Islands this spring and would like information on how to get there and on accommodations. -- John A. Dillon, Waitsfield, Vt.      A.  Attu, the westernmost of the Aleutians, is the site of a Loran station, manned by the Coast Guard as a navigation aid to ships. Travel to Attu and to Kiska is generally restricted to those on military business. Attu and Kiska were occupied by the Japanese for 15 months during World War II, and some Japanese tour groups visit the islands by ship. However, the biggest draw for Americans is bird watching. Birds migrating in late spring from Asia to Eastern Siberia can be sighted, among them the Siberian rubythroat, the Mongolian plover and the long-toed stint. Also of note is the nonmigrating white-tailed eagle.   Visiting on your own is an elaborate undertaking. First, to visit either island you must request and receive permission from three offices: Commander (DAN), 17th Coast Guard District, Post Office Box 3-5000, Juneau, Alaska 99802","excerpt":"Commanding Officer, United States Coast Guard Loran Station Attu, care of Box 90, United States Coast Guard Support Center, Kodiak, Alaska 99619, and Refuge Manager, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Post Office Box 5251 NAS, F.P.O. Seattle, Wash. 98791.   Second, you must take along camping equipment and food, as there are no hotels or restaurants on the islands. (Some travelers stay at the Loran station on Attu, but they are usually on official business.)   And third, you must arrange transportation. There is an airstrip on Attu but no scheduled air service. One company that charters flights to Attuout of Anchorage is Peninsula Airways (4851 Aircraft Drive, Anchorage, Alaska 99502; 907-243-2485), which will fly seven or eight passengers for $10,000 round trip. Each 1,400-mile leg takes about six hours or more. If a group stays overnight, the plane will return to Anchorage and come back to Attu, charging for two round trips. Kiska Island, 200 miles east southeast of Attu, can be reached only by sea. The nearest place a boat can be chartered is Dutch Harbor, more than 700 miles to the east. The cost is said to be prohibitive.   There is, however, an annual bird-watchers' tour to Attu that takes care of lodging, food, transportation and paper work, organized by Attour Inc. (2027 Partridge Lane, Highland Park, Ill. 60035; 708-831-0207). The next trip takes place May 11 to June 2, 1991, and will cost $4,300 a person out of Anchorage. Participants stay in two abandoned Coast Guard buildings that are furnished, supplied with electricity, heat and a kitchen. The trip is limited to 48 participants. During May, high temperatures on Attu average in the mid-40's and the lows in the mid-30's.  Tours to Cambodia    Q.     I am interested in finding a tour out of Bangkok to Angkor Wat and possibly Phnom Penh and Saigon. -- Harriet Tamen, New York, N.Y.       A.  A tour company in Bangkok that is experienced in running such tours is Diethelm Travel, 140/1 Kian Gwan Building, Wireless Road, Bangkok 10500, Thailand; telephone 255-9150 through -9170. The country code is 66 and the city code is 2. The company can be faxed at 256-0248. Diethelm runs a five-day tour of Laos and Cambodia for $1,350 a person.  There can also combinations with Vietnam, and also a variety of Vietnam tours from three to nine days.    H.M.C. Travel (4066 Drummond Road, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada L2E 6B9; 416-356-3381) runs eight-day programs out of Bangkok December through April that go to Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), Phnom Penh, Angkor Wat, and the seaside city of Bungtau. The cost is $3,895 a person in double occupancy, including ground and air transportation, hotels and all meals.    Travel Corporation of America (Post Office Box 2630, Newport Beach, Calif., 92658-2630; 800-992-2003 and 800-992-2004 in California) is planning to run 17-day tours from Bangkok to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia (including Phom Penh and Angkor Wat) for $3,595 a person, which will cover land costs but not flights. Pending State Department permission to run the tours, the company is taking names of interested participants.  Caribbean Thalassotherapy    Q.     Can you help me find a spa in the Caribbean that offers thalasso therapy? -- Sally Steinberg, New York, N.Y.     A.  The term thalassotherapy derives from the Greek word thalassa, or sea. Thalassotherapy treatments may involve seawater, seaweed, algae or mud, all said to be rich in vitamins and minerals and to be beneficial to skin and hair.    There is a spa resort on the island of St. Lucia that has a thalassotherapy center. It is Le Sport (Post Office Box 437, Cariblue Beach, St. Lucia, West Indies; 800-544-2883 or 809-452-8551), which offers a \\"Body Holiday\\" program. For one price, it provides guests with room, all meals, spa treatments and land and water sports. Thalassotherapy treaments include an \\"algae bubble bath\\"; a small salt-water swimming pool with sea-water jets; seaweed wraps; massages using seaweed extracts, and high-pressure showers of sea water. The current lowest cost is $195 a person a day in double occupancy. From Dec. 16 to Jan. 4 and Jan. 19 to April 5, the lowest daily rate is $260, and Jan. 5 to Jan. 18 it is $220. Vienna Opera House    Q.     My husband and I will be in Vienna April 16 and 17. What is being performed at the Opera House and how can we get tickets ahead of time?  -- Ruth Manishin, Morristown, N.J.     A.  On April 16 there will be a performance by Ballet of the Vienna State Opera. The program includes \\"Verklarte Nacht\\" by Schonberg, choreographed by Jirschi Kilian, and Beethoven's Adagio for Hammerklavier, choreographed by Hans Manen. Tickets are $10 to $96. Set for April 17 is the opera \\"Ariadne auf Naxos\\" by Richard Strauss featuring the soprano Gwyneth Jones and conducted by Horst Stein. Tickets are $14 to $115.   Tickets can be obtained from the Austrian Association of Federal Theaters (Bundestheater-Verband, Goethegasse 1, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; telephone 514440). When dialing from the United States, precede the number with 431. Requests for tickets must be in writing, either by mail or fax (514442969). Include a credit card number for billing.   Some ticket requests come in a year or more before an event, and the opera house advises ordering tickets as soon as possible, certainly no less than six weeks before an event. However, any tickets remaining can be bought by credit card within six days of an event by phoning 5131513.
