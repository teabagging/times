In 1783 both became British possessions, and the two islands were united in 1882. Britain granted them independence in 1983. The country's economy is almost entirely based on sugar exports, so when Hurricane Hugo devastated sugar yields in 1990, the welfare of the entire population was affected. The reign of Kennedy Alphonse Simmonds, the only prime minister St. Kitts and Nevis had ever known, ended in July 1995, when Denzil Douglas's opposition Labour party defeated Kennedy's People's Action Movement. March 2000 elections confirmed the change: Labour took eight of the 11 seats, PAN took none. The continued fall of world sugar prices hurt the economy and in 1997 some leaders in Nevis started a movement to separate from St. Kitts because of high taxes.

Russia is the largest and most powerful of the states to emerge from the former Soviet Union. As the seat of the Soviet empire that existed for over 70 years, the Russians wielded tremendous power both within the U.S.S.R. and in the international sphere. Almost from their emergence as a separate people, the Russians have extended the boundaries of their country to include a wide variety of non-Russian people. Both the Russian Czars and the Bolsheviks who came to power in 1917 have a long history of expansionist policies, which explains why, even today, an important part of the Russian national identity is that of leader of a large empire. In the ninth century A.D., Viking traders organized a state, which they called Rus, in the river valleys between the Baltic and the Black Seas, centered on the cities of Kiev and Novgorod. In time the Vikings were absorbed into the native Slavic population; in 998 a Ruthenian prince of Kiev accepted Christianity from Constantinople. In the 13th century, Mongols under Genghis Khan and his descendants conquered most of Russia, and the Mongol Golden Horde maintained its power through the 14th century, exercising loose control over Novgorod and Moscow. From the mid-19th century, Moscow grew to become the center of a new state that gathered in other cities and territories as Mongol power waned. Ivan III (Ivan the Great, 1440–1505) consolidated the power of Moscow; his marriage to a Byzantine princess led him to regard his empire as a third Rome, heir to the religious tradition of Constantinople. His grandson, Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible, 1530–84), adopted the title czar (from the Latin caesar). He broke the power of the aristocratic boyar class and greatly extended the power of Moscow through military conquest. Over the next two centuries, Russia carried out a steady program of expansion eastward into Siberia and across the Bering Strait to Alaska, until the empire covered one-sixth of the land surface of the globe. Peter the Great (1672–1725) made Russia a Baltic and Black Sea naval power, brought Russia into the European state system, and instituted a sweeping, if superficial, Westernization of his realm. His new capital at St. Petersburg became one of the most splendid cities in Europe. At the end of the 18th century, Catherine the Great (1729–96) participated with Prussia and Austria in the partitions of Poland, and Russia thereby became a major power in central Europe. Catherine's grandson Alexander I (1777–1825), member of the grand coalition that defeated Napoleon, was not only czar of Russia but also king of Poland and grand duke of Finland. His troops occupied Paris in 1815. The Russian aristocracy became ardent Francophiles in the 19th century, ignoring growing problems at home. After losing the Crimean War in 1856, Russia began to develop Siberia and the southern territories near the border of Persia. Alaska was sold to the United States in 1867. In a major reform of the agricultural system, serfdom was abolished under Alexander II in 1861, though the newly independent peasantry, organized into agricultural cooperatives, only slowly derived benefits from its freedom. The late 19th century also marked the beginning of modern industrialization in Russia and of extensive development in Siberia, aided by state investment in railroads and mining. Under the last czar, Nicholas II (1868–1918), Russia was defeated by Japan in a war over Manchuria in 1905. The defeat sparked a naval mutiny and an abortive revolution, which led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy and other limited political reforms. Further military losses in World War I set the stage for the monarchy's downfall in the revolution of 1917. The initial revolution of March 1917 brought a relatively moderate socialist (Menshevik) group to power. Its principal leader, Aleksandr Kerensky, organized a republican government and tried to maintain the Russian war effort but failed to gain control of the many contending revolutionary factions of the time. The Germans allowed the radical Bolshevik leader, Vladimir I. Lenin, to return to Russia, where he and his followers organized workers' soviets (councils) hostile to the Menshevik republic. Bolshevik forces occupied Petrograd (St. Petersburg was renamed in 1914) on Nov. 7, 1917 (October in the old Byzantine calendar, hence the name October Revolution), arrested the cabiinet, and put in place a Council of People's Commissars, under Lenin's chairmanship. There followed four years of civil war between Bolshevik, Menshevik, and czarist forces, in the course of which Nicholas II and his family were executed by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Decreeing land to the peasants, worker management in industry, and repudiation of czarist debts, the Bolsheviks won the survival of their regime by withdrawing from World War I. The 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which gained peace with Germany, granted freedom to Finland, the Baltic republics, Poland, Ukraine, and Bessarabia. At the conclusion of the civil war in 1921, the Soviet state was established, with Ukraine reabsorbed into the Soviet Union. The Bolshevik victory also resulted in the creation in 1921 of the Mongolian People's Republic as a close Soviet ally. The early 1920's are now remembered as a “golden age” of Soviet history. Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP) allowed some role for market forces and private ownership and led to a brief burst of economic growth. Art, literature, and science flourished in an atmosphere of revolutionary enthusiasm and little censorship. Lenin died on Jan. 21, 1924, and after a power struggle, was succeeded by Josef Stalin. Stalin supported Communist revolutions in China and elsewhere through the Communist International (Comintern) but generally withdrew from foreign engagements in order to concentrate on domestic affairs. Under Lenin, and even more under Stalin, the Communist party established a police state, condemning millions of people to internal exile in the 1920's and consolidating all power in the hands of the state. In 1929 agriculture was forcibly collectivized, leading to the starvation or execution of millions of peasants, while forced industrialization was carried out under a series of five-year plans. Under the guise of socialist revolution, the Russians continued in much the same manner as their czarist heirs. The Bolsheviks forcibly incorporated most of the territories of the old empire, and once in charge, insisted that Russian be the state language and that Russian Communist party officials run the republics. On the national level, Stalin's chief rival, Leon Trotsky, was expelled from the U.S.S.R. in 1929 (and assassinated by Stalinist agents in Mexico in 1940). Stalin's obsession with eliminating all possible rivals for power led to a series of purges which saw the summary execution of an estimated seven million of presumed “enemies of the state” and the imprisonment in concentration camps of an estimated 12 million more. Russia's reemergence as a world power was signaled by the signing in Aug. 1939 of the Hitler-Stalin Pact, a nonaggression treaty through which Stalin aimed to recover territories lost in 1918. Poland was partitioned, Bessarabia annexed (as the Moldavian republic), Finland conquered and partitioned, and the Baltic republics absorbed. When in June 1941 Hitler turned against his ally and invaded Russia, unprepared Russian armies retreated. But Stalin emerged as a national leader in the “Great Patriotic War,” restructuring the army and enlisting the support of the Orthodox church and relying on calls to Russian patriotism in rallying the population. In the early winter of 1942, the war changed course as Russia broke the German siege of Stalingrad, and Russian armies began their westward push that would carry them to the Elbe River by April 1945. By the end of World War II, Stalin had reestablished the old czarist boundaries of Russia, and he had a ring of occupied states along his western boundary and a divided Germany beyond. Over the years 1945–48, he engineered a thorough communization of those occupied states, turning them into Russian satellites. Stalin died in March 1953. He was succeeded by a collegial form of party and government leadership, from which Nikita Khrushchev, the party chairman, emerged as the paramount figure. In a secret speech to the party leadership in 1956, Khrushchev denounced Stalin for crimes against the party. He announced a set of new policies designed to bring about rapid modernization and consolidated his power when he became premier in 1958. The Khrushchev years brought a small but steady rise in living standards and a “thaw” in police state methods, the KGB (state security police) being brought under party control. In foreign policy there was a thaw as well. In 1953 the Soviets agreed to an armistice in Korea and tolerated the formation of a more liberal government in Hungary. In 1955 Russia returned the Porkkala peninsula to Finland and agreed to the Austrian State Treaty, which created an independent and neutral Austria. But the limits of disengagement became clear in 1956 with the ruthless Soviet suppression of the Hungarian uprising. A summit conference between Khrushchev and Eisenhower in 1960 led to a propaganda victory for Russia when an American U-2 spy plane was shot down over Russian territory on May 1. And in 1962 Khrushchev tried to install Soviet missiles in Cuba, a reckless adventure from which he had to back down during the Cuban missile crisis. While on vacation in 1964, Khrushchev was removed from office and replaced as party secretary by Leonid Brezhnev and as premier by Aleksei Kosygin. His failure to deliver on promises for domestic economic growth and his recklessness in foreign affairs seem to have been responsible for his downfall. The new leaders embarked on an ambitious program of military (especially naval) expansion and pressed ahead vigorously with a space program that had begun with the triumphant launching of Sputnik I in 1957. Under Brezhnev and Kosygin the U.S.S.R. became more aggressive in foreign policy. The severe suppression of Czechoslovakia's “Prague Spring” in 1968 occasioned development of the Brezhnev Doctrine, whereby Russia claimed the right to intervene militarily in any socialist state. Soviet involvement in the Third World grew, with Russia supporting Vietnam against China; Syria and the PLO against Israel; leftist regimes in Angola, Ethiopia, and elsewhere in Africa; and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Cuba emerged as the principal Soviet proxy in supplying troops for leftist causes in the Third World. In 1979 Soviet troops moved into Afghanistan, allegedly at the invitation of its Marxist government, and remained bogged down there for a decade. Under American pressure, Brezhnev permitted the emigration of about 130,000 Jews and 40,000 ethnic Germans. Domestically, the regime grew more oppressive; censorship was tightened and dissidents sentenced to terms in penal mental institutions. Elitism and nepotism created a self-perpetuating and interlocking network of power at the top, while the nation as a whole stagnated. Brezhnev's death in 1982 brought about a rapid series of leadership transfers. Yuri Andropov, head of the KGB, succeeded Brezhnev as party secretary but died after only 15 months. He was succeeded by Konstantin Chernenko, who died 13 months later. In March 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev became party secretary, ushering in a new era. Gorbachev first instituted a cautious shake-up of state and party bureaucrats, promoting younger men who were technocrats rather than party professionals. Under the slogan glasnost (openness, candor), censorship was relaxed, and policy was openly debated in the press. Jamming of broadcasts from the West was ended. By the end of 1990, freedom of the press and of religion had been approved, and private citizens were given limited rights to own small businesses. Gorbachev's other slogan, perestroika (restructuring), addressed his aim to boost morale and increase economic efficiency by devolving responsibility for economic decisions away from the party and government and toward industrial and agricultural managers. Perestroika raised expectations but not output; the system remained sluggish, inefficient, and burdened with the vested interests of state planners. The nuclear power plant disaster of Chernobyl in April 1986 and a gas pipeline fire that killed hundreds of passengers in passing railroad trains in June 1989 exemplified the industrial mismanagement against which Gorbachev's policies were aimed. During 1989–91 there were strikes by coal miners, and shortages of food and consumer goods worsened. In foreign policy Gorbachev pursued arms reduction agreements with the United States and withdrew Soviet forces from Afghanistan. His international stature exceeded that of any previous Soviet leader; but his problems at home made him increasingly unpopular. Foremost among his problems at home concerned the U.S.S.R.'s various ethnic nationalities. The southern Muslim regions of the U.S.S.R. were the scene of turmoil since the anti-Russian riots in Kazakhstan in 1986; in 1988 riots broke out in the Christian republic of Armenia over the status of ethnic Armenians in the neighboring Muslim republic of Azerbaijan. Fighting in Armenia and Azerbaijan worsened in 1989–90, leading to a breakdown of government control in some areas. Ethnic warfare between Uzbeks and Turks in Uzbekistan led to numerous deaths, and sporadic violence in other central Asian republics broke out in 1990. The Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania raised their old national flags, enacted laws giving their native languages priority over Russian, and proclaimed the superiority of local republican law over the laws of the Soviet Union. Lithuania proclaimed its independence from the U.S.S.R. in Dec. 1989, provoking a confrontation with international ramifications; Lithuania finally agreed to postpone its independence in 1990 pending negotiations with the Soviet government. Within the U.S.S.R. itself, the Russian republic elected maverick Boris Yeltsin as president and pressed for greater autonomy; Yeltsin resigned from the Communist party in July 1990. The total collapse of communist governments in Eastern Europe in 1989—ed to Gorbachev's problems and led to the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact; the Berlin Wall fell in Nov. 1989; and the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) was dissolved in July 1990. Gorbachev responded by assuming the presidency of the U.S.S.R. and increasing the powers of that office, and he held off challenges to his leadership in 1990–91. Yet defections from the party by both right- and left-wing groups threw the party's future role in the U.S.S.R. itself in doubt. Demonstrations against Gorbachev and the Communist party took place in Moscow and elsewhere as the economy worsened and food supplies dwindled. In June of 1991, Boris Yeltsin was elected president of the Russian republic in the first direct elections for the post. His stature soared when he rallied opposition to an unsuccessful coup to topple Gorbachev in August. In December 1991 Gorbachev and Yeltsin agreed that the U.S.S.R. would cease to exist as of Jan. 1, 1992. In early December 1991, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Russian Federation signed the Minsk Agreement that created the Commonwealth of Independent States, and on Dec. 21, Ukraine and 11 other former union republics officially committed themselves to the union by signing the Alma-Ata Declaration. In Feb. 1992 Russian president Yeltsin agreed to begin dismantling the vast arsenal of Russian nuclear weapons, 80 percent of which were on Russia's territory, the rest being scattered across Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazkhstan. While Belarus agreed to allow Russia to control the weapons, Kazakhstan and Ukraine used their weapons as bargaining chips. Throughout 1992, Pres. Yeltsin took center stage, first signing the historic second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) with the U.S. in January, then in April rallying the people to support a referendum on government elections and to approve his policies, and finally in June calling together a Constitutional Assembly to write a new constitution. As the Russian economy continued to founder, however, Yeltsin became the target of attacks by former Communists. In Dec. 1992, Yeltsin barely survived a series of votes in Parliament that would have severely limited his control. This struggle came to a violent head on Sept. 21, 1993, when Yeltsin declared Parliament dissolved and called for new elections to be held in December; Parliament then voted to impeach Yeltsin and appointed Vice Pres. Aleksandr V. Rutskoi to replace him. Anti-Yeltsin forces called for a national strike and barricaded themselves inside the Parliament building for two weeks. Anti-Yeltsin rallies escalated into serious violence when 10,000 protesters overwhelmed riot police and broke through government barricades, causing Yeltsin to summon military police. The leaders of the revolt surrendered after tanks fired directly on the Parliament building, and were immediately sent to prison. At least 100 people were killed in the exchange. In the aftermath, Yeltsin moved quickly to parlay his victory into even greater political power, by banning several opposition parties, firing powerful opponents, and calling for new parliamentary elections. He announced he would stay in office until his term expired in 1996, and in Nov. 1993 he unveiled the country's first post-Soviet constitution, which centralized power in the executive presidency and limited the powers of the constituent regions. One of these regions, Chechnya, had long threatened secession from Russia and in 1994 its leaders took that action. In Dec. Yeltsin ordered the army to restore government control, but it took months of fighting before Grozny, the rebel capital, fell to Russian troops. In 1996, unrest by Russia's nationalist faction eroded much of Yeltsin's support, forcing him into a runoff election against the Communist candidate Gennadi Zyuganov in May 1996. But in the runoff, Yeltsin decisively beat back the Communist challenger. In August, Yeltsin formed a cabinet of pro-business technocrats; in the Fall he chucked National Security advisor (and future rival) Lebed, and he agreed to the final withdrawl of Russia's Chechnya brigades. Yeltsin met Pres. Clinton in Helsinki in March 1997 subsequently agreeing to NATO's eastward expansion in return for NATO's agreement neither to deploy nor to store nuclear weapons there. Economic difficulties reached serious proportions in 1998 and the I.M.F. and the U.S. pledged huge amounts to keep the economy from crumbling. In the spring, Yeltsin replaced many of his ministers with reform-minded bureaucrats. But in the summer, the economy turned down again, and Yeltsin was forced to devalue the ruble. As the economy worsened day-by-day and international lenders refused aid, Russia stood on the brink of collapse. Even with Mr. Yeltsin's illnesses, personal volatility, and political capriciousness, the I.M.F. and various western investment “Clubs” managed to keep rescheduling Russian debt, so Russia was able to stumble on despite essentially defaulting on loan repayments. The August 1999 appointment of Vladimir Putin as prime minister made him the fifth in 18 months, the third in a row drawn from the secret police. One day after Putin's appointment, insurgents in the Federal Republic of Dagestan, operating out of Chechnya, proclaimed an independent Islamic state; hence, Putin's determination to have it out with Chechnya. Vigorously pursued and (unlike the 1994–96 debacle) very popular, the war went well for Russia and Putin's popularity soared as Grozny fell. Putin triumphed in the March presidential election occasioned by Yeltsin's December resignation. Putin consolidated his power and took a leading role in opposing U.S. plans to build a missile shield but cooperating with U.S. determination to end terrorism. As 2001 drew to a close, three-pronged Russian American talks continued: American would support closer Russian ties with NATO; both would reduce by two-thirds their nuclear arms; and the U.S. would withdraw from the 1972 ABM pact. Meanwhile (in mid-July 2002) Russia and China signed a 20-year Friendship Treaty, the first since the end of the Cold War. In Nov. 2002 Russian troops began arriving in Kyrgystan, ostensibly to counter terrorism, but likely also to establish a military presence in the face of U.S. bases in Afghanistan. The war in Chechnya took a particularly nasty turn, from the Oct. 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis to the eight suicide bombings of May-August 2003 which killed over 150.

The Michelin two-star chef (and a worthy candidate for a coveted third star) recently transferred his restaurant from an airy, loftlike space in the center of town to a classic Art Deco mansion, built by a local pharmacist in 1932 as a house designed for gastronomic celebration.   Like Mr. Gagnaire's cuisine -- grounded in the classics but offering bold touches of creativity, enthusiasm and humor -- the house fuses past, present and future artistic traditions. Dining in this white and ivory space with bold touches of color is like feasting in a bright, modern living museum.

The menu streamlined, dining room staff efficient, dining rooms refurbished, thoroughly professional kitchen orchestrated by its longtime chef de cuisine, Francois Kerohas, together with Mrs. Eudes's gracious warmth and Mr. Eudes's felicitous attentiveness as he suggests special dishes and appropriate wines from his cellar - that old magic is there again.  Right now Auberge Argenteuil is one of our favorite dining places this side of the Atlantic.   Among the many fine dishes the kitchen sends forth, soups proved exceptional.

One particularly sneaky strategy, explored in the first half of a Mostly Mozart concert at Avery Fisher Hall on Monday evening, is to offer two entirely expendable pieces of early 19th-century fluff as preludes to one of Mozart's mature string quartets.   The innocuous openers were a Flute and Harp Sonata by Louis Spohr and Rossini's Andante and Variations for the same instruments. Marielle Nordmann, the harpist, clearly had more at stake in these pieces than Jean-Pierre Rampal, the flutist. Ms. Nordmann played her harp lines as a nuanced web of sound with an appealing dynamic shape that highlighted each work's few interesting harmonic turns. Mr. Rampal played as if he were on automatic pilot, producing an attractive enough tone but doing little to make the pieces seem more substantial than they were.

The show, \\"Arman 1955-1991: A Retrospective,\\" brings together 60 sculptures that trace the course of a nearly 40-year career spent in New York and the artist's native France.

From 1973 comes \\"Achilles Syndrome,\\" a pile of shoe trees arranged in the shape of a foot.
