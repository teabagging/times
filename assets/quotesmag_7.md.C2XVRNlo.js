The antihero, Marcello Clerici (JEAN-LOUIS TRINTIGNANT), is a bureaucratic cold fish deformed by a dysfunctional haute-bourgeois family and a childhood sexual trauma. In 1938, betrothed to a giggly middle-class woman (STEFANIA SANDRELLI), he accepts an assignment from Mussolini's secret police that involves the assassination of his former mentor, a philosopher living in exile in Paris. In Mr. Trintignant's characterization, you can see the lineaments of Moravia's portrait of a man willing to sacrifice his own decency -- his own soul -- in the interests of building ''a normal life.''    But Mr. Bertolucci subverts this desire -- and subverts Moravia's realism in the bargain -- by placing his Marcello in a world where nothing at all is normal. Intriguing as ''The Conformist'' is as the reconstruction of one vexed historical moment -- the late 30's -- it is even more evocative of another, the late 1960's and early 70's, when cinema seemed to be entering a period of decadence that was also a second youth.

The idea that world culture can be encapsulated in a few books, even by fine writers, reflects an era in world society long since gone. It presumes knowledge as a closed room, a box that one enters to live a charmed life of meaning.   People now read for enjoyment and enlightenment. Mr. Adler is quite wrong to suggest that in some next round, we will have a \\"Great Books\\" series that is less Eurocentric. I submit that there will be no next round. For now, the idea of Western culture has no more difficult chore than to outlive its erstwhile most deadly defenders.

It matters not if the orchestra has just delivered a tremendous performance of Sibelius's Fifth Symphony under Colin Davis, as it did last April. Offer that same Sibelius performance with the Chicago Symphony at Orchestra Hall, or the Cleveland Orchestra at Severance, and an ovation will seal the experience. There have also been occasions when Mr. Masur stopped conducting, and even left the podium, because the Philharmonic's listeners were quite audibly not listening.

But the Administration and Congress are expected to act shortly to ease their concerns.    One of the major concerns about the new law, which goes into effect on Oct. 1, is the cap of 25,000 that it will place on the number of foreign performers who may receive visas to enter the United States each year. It cannot be calculated if that number is greater or smaller than the number of visas allowed under present law.    The reason, said Richard L. Kenney, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, is that performers have been part of a larger category - with a maximum of 78,000 visas - that included \\"doctors, lawyers, skilled craftsmen, journalists","excerpt":"anybody recognized in a field or as a professional.\\" No records have been kept to show how many were in the arts.    A key Senate aide involved with the new bill agreed with Mr. Kenney's assessment. Jerry M. Tinker, principal subcommittee staff officer to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, said th bill would be changed.    \\"The artificial cap of 25,000 came out of the blue,\\" Mr. Tinker said. Since the 25,000 figure is in the statute, he added, changing it would require a Congressional bill known as a technical correction.    Another section of the new law that would be changed by administrative process or in the technical correction, he said, is a prohibition against applying for a visa more tha 90 days before the scheduled trip. Presenters of operas and ballets have complained that such performances have to scheduled years in advance and that the performers need to apply early so they can be sure they will be admitted. Lobbying for Change     Representatives of arts organizations remain concerned. One group, the League of American Theaters and Producers, is lobbying to change some of the provisions, particularly the 90-day limit on applying for visas. George Wachtel, the league's research director, said, \\"They went about this without consulting the industry affected.\\"    That charge was disputed by Bruce A. Morrison, a former Representative from Connecticut who, as chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and International Law, led the House's work in drafting the new law.    \\"This provision was drafted after extensive consultation with workers as well as owners,\\" he said. \\"The legitimate interest of U.S. workers were protected without denying entry to a full range of foreign artists.\\"    Mr. Morrison said the number of performers who could be admitted under the new law was almost certainly larger than before. Recognized or Unique     Mr. Kenney of the immigration service said the rules establish the criteria under which up to 25,000 visas may be issued each year to entertainers and athletes. Applicants will have to demonstrate that they are \\"internationally recognized,\\" performing under a reciprocal arrangement, or participating in a culturally unique area. Performers who do not meet those criteria will be able to apply in a separate category for people of \\"extraordinary ability.\\"    Mr. Morrison said he thought most performers would be admitted under one category or another.    Mr. Tinker said the measure was approved in the rush to adjourn Congress last October and that Senate negotiators would not have agreed to the changes had they known of the difficulties the measure would cause.     \\"We were led to believe it was housecleaning,\\" Mr. Tinker said. \\"There's a broad consensus on what ought to be done.\\" Clarification Sought On Visas for Performers"},{"year":"1988","title":"LEAD: OUR friend was a coxswain at Keble College of Oxford a few years back.

In all, a staggering $150 million global marketing campaign. Come on already! It's just some stuff you put in your computer. But guess what: the public lapped it up. People lined up to buy software when they should be sleeping, with a spokesman for Egghead stores saying all the to-do had \\"created two Christmas seasons\\" (a frightening thought). All this doesn't mean the Justice Department is easing up on the antitrust front. Janet Reno made a point of saying, on Windows 95 Day itself: \\"The investigation continues.\\" TOBACCO Just Follow the Nicotine To make cigarettes, Philip Morris mixes crushed tobacco leaves and stems, and then adds back the lost nicotine. Is this \\"spiking\\" with nicotine, or \\"recombining\\" ingredients? This would seem mere semantics -- and a mere quibble, considering smoking's vast health toll. But the word \\"spike,\\" used by ABC News, set off a multi-zillion-dollar lawsuit -- one the industry and smoking foes were watching with care. Then last week, out of the blue, ABC put its tail between it legs and apologized -- on prime time, yet -- to Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds. But that isn't the end of it: Philip Morris filed a ton of documents in the case, and Representative Henry Waxman, a vocal tobacco foe, figures there's some damning stuff in those papers and asked that they be made public.  TELEVISION A Network of His Own? Some people dream of vacation houses, new boats, more hair, writing a novel. Barry Diller's wish list is short and constant: for some reason, he wants his very own TV network, and isn't going to rest till he gets it. As head of QVC last year, he almost bought CBS. And last week he got control of Silver King Communications, which owns 12 UHF stations that could be the basis for a new network. He and Rupert Murdoch, after all, started Fox with a few stations, but the difference is that Mr. Diller will be relying on cable now. Given the spread of cable, that's no big obstacle, but is there room in a cluttered public mind for yet another network?  GARMENT INDUSTRY Sweating It Out in California It's a familiar trend: under ferocious pressure from bargain-hunters, garment-making jobs are driven overseas. But some in the industry have found a way to essentially send jobs abroad but really keep them right in Southern California, an area decimated by lost aerospace jobs. The trick: bring in Asian workers illegally and put them to work in sweatshops. A raid last week -- the second this month -- found 56 illegal immigrants, mostly Thais, apparently recruited to sew garments headed for big department stores. And of course, like everything else these days -- including that headache you have -- it's Bill Clinton's fault. The Administration has \\"allowed slavery to exist for years in the United States,\\" said Gov. Pete Wilson of California. Mr. Wilson wants to be President.  TECHNOLOGY What Next? E-Bananas? E-checks? Oh, why not. There's E-everything else. E-mail. E-speak. E-think. E-love (that has its limits). E-ads. So, yes, last week a group of banks and E-companies said they'd design an \\"electronic check\\" system, to begin tests next year. No, this isn't E-bill-paying, already offered by banks. These are real checks (well, as real as anything in computer never-never land) -- they can be sent for birthdays as well as doctors' bills, and can bounce as high as paper. There will be electronic checkbooks -- cards inserted into computer slots. And there will be security codes called \\"digital signatures\\" promising safety and security. (Right: like all the other ways we're promised privacy as more and more machines peek into our brains.)  SECURITIES LAW Insider Trading, Redefined A quiz: A lottery director buys stock in a company, then gives that company a lucrative state contract. Is it insider trading? Not to a Federal appeals court, which recently threw out the securities-fraud conviction of the director, Elton Bryan of West Virginia. By this court's definition, only those who work for the target company in a takeover would be barred from trading","excerpt":"anyone else with the inside scoop could cash in. If this ruling becomes widely accepted, insider-trading cases could rapidly become rare. Not that Mr. Bryan rejoiced at the reversal: he was also convicted of perjury, mail fraud and wire fraud, and he's as much in jail as he ever was.  INVESTING Those Manly Mutual Funds You know those mutual funds that, like Indiana Jones scouring the jungle for treasure, vow bold investments at the earth's far corners? Definite guy-type investments. Well, maybe all that overheated language gets funds a bit too excited. Some of them, it seems, threw money at a company that, on close inspection, might end up being fool's gold. Arakis Energy's promises were lavish -- a huge pipeline project in Sudan, a big investment from a Saudi prince -- and funds lapped it up, sending its market value above $500 million last month. (Not bad for a company with about $1 million in the till.) But that close inspection came last week, as regulators asked the Canadian company just what it was made of. Trading was halted, the stock was delisted in Vancouver, and Arakis said nothing to persuade Nasdaq to resume trading.  THE NUMBERS An Economic Roller Coaster On Tuesday, the economy was fine.

The Danger Zone    There is a blind spot of 10 feet around a school bus where the driver may not be able to see a child. Children should learn to move away from the bus quickly after getting off and not to circle close to the bus before boarding. A child should never enter this blind spot to pick up a dropped book or other object, but should wait until the bus has left and traffic is clear in all directions.  Waiting for the Bus    Children should get to the bus stop a few minutes early. Adults should accompany small children or have a volunteer at the stop.  Clothing    Clothing should be securely fastened so as not to catch on anything when a child is boarding or getting off the bus.
