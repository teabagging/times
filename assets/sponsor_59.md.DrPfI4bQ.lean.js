Officials had hoped to exterminate 10,000 animals by Saturday.     The campaign focused heavily on the more than 130 wildlife markets in Guangdong Province, where breeders, traders and buyers traffic in the animals -- dogs, cats, boars, ostriches, rats, turtles -- that are considered delicacies by many diners. At the Xinyuan market in the provincial capital, Guangzhou, the people who sell the animals also live with them, a proximity consistent with the prevailing theory that the disease somehow jumped from animals to humans. Yet angry workers at Xinyuan note that no one at the market has ever gotten the disease.
