Barrie's unforgettable playlet, \\"The Old Lady Shows Her Medals,\\" which is now at the Paramount Theatre under the changed title of \\"Seven Days' Leave.\\" What is significant in this sensitive production is that Beryl Mercer, who played the part of the elderly charwoman in the original New York stage contribution in 1917, also appears in the same rôle on the screen. The gaunt kilted soldier is impersonated by Gary Cooper, who was last seen in the shadow conception of \\"The Virginian.\\"Here is a picture that is a picture. No golden-haired girl adorns the cast and most of the action is interpreted by Miss Mercer and Mr. Cooper, and wherever they go, while Private Dowey, now of the Canadian Black Watch, is on leave in London, is intensely interesting.Richard Wallace, who brought to the screen a year ago that clever silent film, \\"The Shopworn Angel,\\" directed this offering. He shares the credit for this worthy adaptation of Sir James's work with Miss Mercer and Mr. Cooper, and while he is the guiding spirit of the film, there's no denying that he is fortunate in having these two players. Miss Mercer's performance is faultless. It is an achievement of the audible screen. She wins one's heart by her restrained and natural acting. She arouses smiles by Mrs. Dowey's guileless speech and by her timidity as she casts an eye on the brawny fighter, who towers above her.And there is no failing to find with Mr. Cooper's impersonation, for, as in his other films, he lends a life-like quality to the rôle. Physically, he is just the man for Private Dowey. The crispness of his speech also helps.Mr. Wallace has endowed his scenes with effective suggestions of London. The charwomen are typical of their kind, especially one who adorns her head with a quartered cricket cap and who winks to herself as she uses her pocket bottle of \\"mother's ruin.\\" The intonation of the others rings true. In fact only winkles are lacking in these scenes—winkles being picked out of their shells with a pin! Failing this delicacy of Blighty's east end, Mr. Wallace compromises by permitting the goddesses of the pail and scrubbing brush to consume watercress with their bread and butter and tea.Whatever may be said concerning the intelligence of audiences, the throng yesterday afternoon at the Paramount laughed and applauded several of the incidents in this \\"Seven Days Leave,\\" and an episode that elicited both tears and smiles was when the great, big Scot took his adopted mother to the dancing floor of the Imperial restaurant. Another excellent touch is where the two are at the theatre, chuckling and laughing at the acts. And still another incident that clicked was the drinking of champagne by Private Dowey and the charwoman.John Farrow and Dan Totheroh are credited with the adaptation, and they have done a capital piece of work in blending the Barrie lines with scenes that were left to the imagination in the play.As may be recalled, the narrative tells of a charwoman who finds she is the only one of four female friends who has no son on the fighting front. She sees a mention in a newspaper of a Private K. Dowey, and as her own name is Dowey, she decides not only to pretend that she is receiving letters from a son at the front, but she further complicates matters by sending cakes to Private Dowey with a letter signed \\"Lady Dolly Kanister,\\" a name she selects from society gossip.By a fortuitous circumstance the Rev. Mr. Willings one day decides that he has found Sarah Ann Dowey's soldier son on leave in London and he escorts Private Dowey to the woman he believes to be the tall fighter's mother. Private Dowey wishes to give his correspondent a piece of his mind and he does so. The letters she had boasted of as beginning \\"Dearest Mother\\" are nothing but blank paper, and then Dowey through a glimpse of a cake finds out that it was not Lady Dolly Kanister who had taken an interest in him, but merely Sarah Ann Dowey. A cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter, followed by a lump of cake, make Dowey more complacent. Mrs. Dowey calls him Kenneth and looks away. The roaring lion becomes amenable, aye, sympathetic, and he thinks of taking Sarah Ann Dowey to dinner. But what would she look like? Quick as a flash Mrs. Dowey produces her \\"merino gown laced up the back and the very latest.\\"After the theatre, supper with wine, a dance","excerpt":"thoughts of desertion and a scuffle with sailors, Dowey makes caustic comments on soldiering and Mrs. Dowey voices her keen disappointment in him. Eventually she succeeds in causing him to abandon the idea of deserting and the big Scot goes back to war. He had told his adopted mother that he was a farmer in Canada and in the trenches one hears him asking another soldier how he could learn to become a farmer. Then comes the call for volunteers to silence two enemy machine guns and Private Dowey meets a valorous end.Dowey's medals are sent by the War Office to Mrs. Dowey and in the last scenes of the film she is going over the decorations and souvenirs of Dowey's seven days' leave. The time comes for her to go to work and once again Mrs. Dowey is perceived with the three other charwomen, pails and brooms in their hands, going forth to their sixpence an hour jobs.

An Alameda County Supervisor, Don Perata, said the coroner's office had confirmed the deaths of 10 people, including that of an Oakland police officer. The Oakland Emergency Services Command Center said five of the dead were from one family, and the Mayor of Oakland said some firefighters had been killed.    Sixty-eight people were taken to hospitals suffering from smoke inhalation and burns, officials said. Most were treated and released, but officials said they expected the number of injured to continue to rise.  Houses Destroyed    The Mayor of Oakland, Elihu Harris, said at a news conference that an estimated 200 houses had been destroyed but that an accurate count was impossible. But Mr. Perata said at a separate news conference later that the estimate was \\"ridiculously low.\\"    Mayor Harris said: \\"Firefighters find themselves overwhelmed. This fire continues to spread and continues to cause chaos.\\"   By late tonight, officials said that 3,200 people had fled their homes, the fire had spread across 1,700 acres in the east Oakland hills section of the city and it was still burning out of control.    Fire raged unchecked at nightfall, when the airplanes and helicopters fighting the blaze were grounded until morning. After darkness fell, a band of orange some 10 miles long stretched across the starless, smoky sky. Flames shot hundreds of feet high in the hills, groves of oily eucalyptus trees exploded and houses were swallowed in flame one at a time.    The blaze jumped from house to house, moving rapidly in a southwesterly direction, and threatened Piedmont, a small town made up mostly of multimillion-dollar homes.    The fire began at 11 A.M. today and is believed to be the rekindling of a small grass fire that began Saturday in the east foothills of the city. Both the City of Oakland and the County of Alameda have declared a state of emergency this afternoon. After arriving from Sacramento by helicopter, Gov. Pete Wilson also declared a state of emergency in the area and placed the National Guard on alert.    On an afternoon of record-breaking heat and gusting wind, the fire raced through the dry canyons, engulfed the ridges, leapt across highways and defied the efforts of more than 200 firefighters from as far away as Mendocino, on California's north coast. Hotel Is Evacuated    Within a few hours at least 45 homes in the exclusive hillside neighborhoods had been destroyed, and a huge condominium complex with stunning views of San Francisco Bay was enveloped in fierce flames.   The Claremont Hotel, an elegant confection in the hills of Oakland near the Berkeley border, was evacuated early in the blaze, as were several dormitories, and fraternity and sorority houses on the southeastern side of the campus of the University of California at Berkeley. Several recreation areas on the ridge were also evacuated.   A few blocks below the Claremont Hotel, curiosity seekers, with handkerchiefs over their mouths and radio headphones on their ears, watched the flames crest the ridge and inch ever lower on the hillside, devouring homes in their wake.   With no sign that the 30-mile-an-hour winds were abating and with the temperature near 90 degrees, it was evident this afternoon that the devastation would be vast. In some cases, people had only minutes to evacuate their homes.   The fire moved so quickly through the tinder dry hills, parched after five years of drought, that areas apparently safe one minute were deadly the next. Police cars crawled through the winding streets, sirens blaring, begging homeowners to evacuate and go to emergency centers that were set up in nearby schools. One such center was opened and closed in a matter of hours as the fire neared.   The Red Cross reported that 800 people had come to the five shelters it had set up.  A Chaotic Scene    The fire closed highways and tunnels, stopped service on certain lines of the region's subway system and caused power failures in Oakland and Berkeley that affected 9,000 customers. Ash and debris rained down and so darkened the sky that streetlamps were turned on for miles around at midday. Across the bay in San Francisco, a dark cover hung over Candlestick Park and a drizzle of ashes fell on the field during the football game between the 49ers and the Detroit Lions.    Explosions were heard around the area, which radio reports said were the result of transformers bursting into flame. Roadblocks and official command posts were hastily assembled, moved and then reassembled elsewhere as the wall of flames moved down the hill and toward the more densely populated neighborhoods of Oakland and Berkeley.   \\"Up there on the ridge line it's taking out houses, pop, pop, pop,\\" said Tracey Prevo, who was helping friends evacuate. \\"Once the force of the blaze comes close, there's nothing a hose can do.\\"   Some people wailed with fear as they loaded their cars or searched for their relatives. One elderly woman driving toward her daughter's home was turned back by the police. 'Oh My God!'    \\"Is Contra Costa Road burning?\\" she asked, referring to her daughter's address.   The policeman nodded silently.   \\"Oh my God! Oh my God!\\" the woman cried.   As a long stream of evacuating cars moved down from the hills, helicopters clattered overhead, dumping buckets of water from nearby Lake Temescal and Lake Merritt. On rooftops throughout the area, homeowners with masks or scarves over their mouths hosed down their roofs.   \\"Grab all the clothes in the closet, throw them in the van,\\" shouted Joel Barnett, atop his house, to his wife below. \\"Grab your toiletries, Pamela. Anything you need. Fast! Run!\\" Burns and Smoke Inhalation    Hospitals were put on alert as patients arrived suffering from burns and smoke inhalation. Health officials warned of the danger of carbon monoxide fumes from the burning of synthetic furniture and of the risk from inhaling the smoke of burned poison oak.    Robert C. Maynard, the publisher of The Oakland Tribune, was forced to leave his home with only the clothes on his back, an extra pair of dungarees and a camera.    \\"It seemed to me early on that the community was outmanned by the fire from the very start,\\" Mr. Maynard said, amid the crack and bang of the flames and the whoosh of the wind.  Borrowing a Truck    Nearby, Brian and Kathy Kelleher loaded a borrowed flat bed truck with mattresses, boxes of compact disks, a tent and sleeping bags, mementos and \\"baby things\\" for the child they are expecting in two months.    \\"You hear about the Santa Ana winds, and what they do in Southern California, but we're not used to it,\\" Mr. Kelleher said. \\"But this is the equivalent of the Santa Ana. People are in disbelief. They're not reacting fast enough.\\"    Among those who lost their homes was Betty Ann Bruno, a television reporter who shared her grief and disbelief with viewers within moments of realizing that the house she had lived in for 30 years was gone.    \\"I kind of knew what this was like, because I've covered things like this,\\" Ms. Bruno said. \\"But it's hard to find the words to express it when it happens to you. It's numbing. I don't even want to start dealing with it emotionally.\\"    Today's fire apparently was a flare-up of a lesser blaze on Saturday, reported to be started by a lighted cigarette, that raced through the grasslands at the margin of Alameda and Contra Costa counties. Prolonged Drought    This was expected to be a terrible fire season, because of the prolonged drought. But unusually cool and gray weather held the fires in check until now, the hottest and windiest time of the year in Northern California.   Electrical failures shut down pumps, causing water to be cut off to the Rockridge section of Oakland near the Berkeley border. Portable pumps restored some water flow, but water pressure in the area remained dangerously low. Firefighters dragged 3,000 feet of hose into hills from functioning hydrants in an unsuccessful attempt to save homes in the area. Officials reported that water used to fight the fire completely drained one reservoir, already low because of the drought.    The blaze was the worst in California since the brush fire in June 1990 that raged through the hills above Santa Barbara, destroying 560 structures.

To study the problem, the National Academy of Sciences 14 months ago assembled a distinguished panel of economists, businessmen, engineers and scientists, headed by Howard A. Johnson, chairman of the corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   Frank Press, president of the academy, said the most remarkable thing about the report was that strong-minded and independent people, who started far apart, came to the unanimous conclusion that United States technological leadership is vulnerable both from domestic weaknesses and from damaging practices of other countries.   The panel reached a double-edged recommendation. The first part was that the United States Government should take a stronger hand in helping to maintain the nation's capacity for technological innovation, to benefit its domestic economy, its national security and its competition for global markets. The second was that the Government should pursue policies to reduce trade frictions troubling economic and political relations among the United States and its principal industrialized allies, and, if necessary, get tough if other countries refuse to cooperate in opening up their markets.
