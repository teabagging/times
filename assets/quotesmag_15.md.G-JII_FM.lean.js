The Supreme Court is the highest law court in the land, but it need not decide every issue pressed upon it. It can call for review of some cases, limit review to one or more issues in a case, hold or ship a case back to a lower court.

It's not Fifth Avenue and it's not Irish, true, but the Caribbean marchers are wonderfully more playful and tolerant, all bright feathers and proud stepping. They exemplify the fresh-off-the-boat blood and emotion that parades seem to need in America to look vital.     As parades go -- and in the United States they step to shifting ethnic and political histories -- the rhythmic West Indian rejoicing now attracts the million-plus crowds that the Hibernians used to on St. Patrick's Days past. The free-speech court victory -- in which Boston parade sponsors won the constitutional right of deciding what should not be expressed -- may only compound the air of ossification that was already overtaking formal St. Paddy's marching.

Recamier. Its author is none other than Edouard Herriot, the French Minister of Public Instruction. Of course all official and literary Paris was there.Over twenty-five years ago, M. Herriot first made his reputation as an authority on this celebrated beauty and the present film follows faithfully the historical facts concerning her. Interest in the film is greatly heightened by the documentary flavor of the epoch, which introduces such figures as Napoleon, Mme. de Staehl, Lucien Bonaparte Chateaubriand, and, in fact, all the leading political, literary and social figures in the time of the Directory, the Empire and the Restoration, overlapping into the days of Louis Phillippe.During the Restoration a well-known whiz went the rounds of Paris in the form of this question put to the gallants of the day:Suppose you were in a boat with Mme. de Staehl and Mme. Recamier and the boat should sink, what would you do?\\"The correct thing to say was: \\"I would rescue Mme. de Staehl and drown with Mme. Recamier.When this question was put to Talleyrand he replied: Oh! Mme. de Staehl knows so many things","excerpt":"surely she knows how to swim.\\"In the brilliant audience which enjoyed this rich evocation of several socially contrasting epochs, in all of which Mme. Recamier's beauty was much admired, were President Doumergue and the members of his Cabinet and many leading critics and members or the French Academy.Heavy Week Precedes Grand Prix.Now begins the heavy week preceding the Grand Prix, which closes the so-called Paris season. It is the eve of the Grande Semaine when the great fashionable, social, artistic and sporting functions make Ville Lumiere the brilliant hub of the world.The week just closed was marked by the usual outburst of charity fetes, but the Grande Semaine is reserved for the horse.Chantilly had a record crowd of turfmen for the French Derby, this being second only to the Grand Prix as a racing event. The horse making the best showing in the Derby is the prospective winner of the Grand Prix.Four American-owned horses which competed in the Derby will enter the greatest race in the world next Sunlay. Ogden Mills's crack Kantar, which is so far the great favorite in the betting, came second in the Derby after winning five consecutive races. Joseph E. Widener, R. D. Strassburger and Richard McCreery are also to be represented in the Grand Prix.Wedding of International Interest.The marriage of Cornelia O'Connor, daughter of Mrs. Francis Drake, now of Paris, and John Keane Wallace, a son of the late President of the Central Union Trust Company of New York, was one of the great social functions of the week.The bridegroom brought many of the wedding party from New York, including Mr. and Mrs. Edward Bulwinkle, Henry Skelding, Mr. and Mrs. James N. Wallace and Mr. and Mrs. Harold Gibson, the latter a schoolmate of the bride at Spence School.\\"Ralph Wallace, who has just completed a trip around the world, was his brother's best man.After a honeymoon motor trip to the Italian takes the young couple are sailing in July to make their home at 4 East Eighty-Eighth Street, New York.Another marriage which took place on the same day that of Princess Anka Radziwill and the Duc deMaille, united a great Polish family with an historic French House. It was an event of social importance from the Eastern Baltic to the Western Mediterranean, and even provoked reminiscences across the Atlantic.Mother Wed Princes of Same Family.The young Princess Anka is the daughter of Princess Dolly Radziwill, who was born under that name and married successively two cousins who were Radziwill Princes. The bride's father was the late Prince Stanislas Radziwill. He had a cousin, Anthony, who took as his wife Dorothy Parker Deacon, daughter of Parker Deacon of Boston and Newport, who had a highly flavored matrimonial career in Paris many years ago.After this marriage was annulled in Rome, Dorothy became the bride, in 1921, of Count Palffy de Erdod of Vienna, where they now live. It will be remembered that about this time her sister, Gladys Deacon, became the Duchess of Marlborough. The Ducde Mailles's family has been associated with the Touraine Chateau district since the Crusades. These Dukes were famous in the days of Jeanne d'Arc.The arrival of Mrs. Emily Davies Vanderbilt immediately after her divorce from William H. Vanderbilt, revives rumors of her probable engagement to a French nobleman. While she has been seen at several social functions, the young divorces has always been with American friends.

A stiff response was essential. In the next move, I blew up the world.   That was discouraging. Granted, this was no video-arcade whiz-bang-beep affair. It was Balance of Power, the most sophisticated strategic simulation in America, other than Pentagon war games. And it was only my first try.   But I had worked for Henry Kissinger in the salad days of the National Security Council. I stood at Zbig Brzezinski's elbow through the bitter torment of Iran. I had spent 20 years, in SALT negotiations, NATO, the State Department and the Council, trying to prevent nuclear war","excerpt":"surely, I could master a mere computer game.

A young mother wheeled a twin-stroller from a shoe store to the Hallmark card shop; a bearded construction worker walked by with a new set of spark plugs; two teen-agers, a boy and a girl, both with blow-dried hair, clutched each other; a store manager headed for a pizza lunch.\\n\\nEveryone appeared at ease, following routine, lost to the mall's peculiar reverie, yet they seemed disengaged, aimless, and - except for seeming to follow a shopping list - bland and undefined. Many writers, from Joan Didion to Frederick Barthelme, have found shopping malls a ripe metaphor for contemporary American society. But I was looking for soul - the essential purpose - and drawing only a blank. I took the failure to understand as my own. If I could follow any of these people home, perhaps I could discover the grandness, drama and inspiration of their lives. Instead, I turned to recent fiction.

The split came as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Jack Straw, the British foreign minister, visited Baghdad leaders to convey that their patience for Iraq's political paralysis is wearing out.A1    Iraqi Gun Ownership Climbs  After a bombing of a Shiite shrine in Samarra, sectarian tensions exploded, and now more Iraqis than ever have been buying, carrying and stockpiling weapons. According to several gun dealers, the prices for weapons have risen swiftly, a sure sign that weapons sales are hot.   A1    A Call for Rumsfeld to Resign  In remarks on the NBC program ''Meet the Press,'' Anthony Zinni, former Army general and commander of Central Command for the Middle East, called for the resignation of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and said Mr. Rumsfeld, among others, should be held accountable for tactical mistakes in Iraq.   A11    Italy's Faith in Leader Wanes  Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his coalition swept Parliament in 2001, with strong support from Sicily, and promised an improved Italy, but the region's current lack of interest in him is echoed nationally as elections approach. It does not seem to help that Mr. Berlusconi does not share the gloom, despite zero percent growth in 2005.   A8    China-Australia Uranium Pact  Australia is scheduled to sign an agreement with China to sell uranium for use in China's nuclear power plants, as the drive to meet soaring energy needs continues. The deal also opens the door for Chinese investment in Australian uranium mines.   A6    Thai Election Rival Abstains  The party of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra won a landslide victory in Thailand's national election in early results, though the voting was marred by the refusal of the main opposition parties to participate. Bombings, complaints of vote buying by the opposition and reports from an unofficial election watchdog group that officials could see inside the voting booths have plagued the election.   A10    Philippine Media Scrutinized  The Philippine news media, some of the most freewheeling in Asia, have come under government pressure. The tactics include watch lists, surveillance, court cases, harassment lawsuits and threats of arrest on charges of sedition, though no journalists have been arrested.   A10    Second Iranian Weapon Test  Iran said it had test-fired what it called a sonar-evading underwater missile, just after it announced a new missile that could carry multiple warheads and evade radar systems. Iran is one of only two countries with a torpedo that fast, Gen. Ali Fadavi of the country's elite Revolutionary Guards said on state television.   A8    NATIONAL   A12-15    Frist Revamps Image As He Looks to 2008  After nearly 12 years in the Senate, Bill Frist of Tennessee is immersed in politics, and as he plots a possible 2008 presidential bid in his waning days as majority leader, he is walking a perilous path. He must show that he can perform the managerial duties of his job and is a leader who can command the national stage.   A1    Home Births at Issue  Doctors, legislators and prosecutors in Indiana and in the nine other states with laws prohibiting midwifery by people other than doctors and nurses say home births supervised by midwives present grave medical risks. Midwives see it differently, saying the ability of women to choose to give birth at home is under assault from a medical establishment dominated by men who resent a centuries-old tradition.   A12    Freed Reporter Returns to U.S.  Jill Carroll, the American reporter who was held hostage for 82 days in Iraq, arrived in the United States and was whisked from the airport for a reunion with her family. Ms. Carroll's return was the end of an ordeal that started in Baghdad when gunmen attacked the car she was in and killed her translator.   A12    G.O.P. Split Over Budget  Republican moderates and conservatives are at odds over the House's $2.8 trillion spending proposal, throwing passage of the plan into doubt this week as fiscal policy continues to vex Congressional Republicans. Republicans are trying to stave off an embarrassing election-year budget defeat that would complicate their push to pass the annual spending bills.   A14    Next Top Aide Works to Unify  Joshua B. Bolten, who will be President Bush's chief of staff starting in mid-April, began to act on one of the White House's top priorities just a few hours after he was named: trying to reunify Republicans behind the administration and keep Mr. Bush's presidency from sinking into lame-duck status.   A14    Religion and Abortion Rights  To its critics, Planned Parenthood is the godless super merchant of abortion. To its supporters, it is the dependably secular defender of abortion rights. But at an abortion rights prayer breakfast at the Washington Hilton, God was everywhere, easily invoked by believers of various stripes.   A12    Iraq War Faces Theater Critics  ''Stuff Happens'' by David Hare, a two-and-a-half hour drama about the march to war in Iraq, began previews last week at the Public Theater in New York. The play mixes real public dialogue with what Mr. Hare imagines was going on behind the gates of the White House and 10 Downing Street.   A14    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-8    Blacks Leaving New York, New Census Data Shows  An accelerating exodus of American-born blacks, coupled with slight declines in birthrates and a slowing influx of Caribbean and African immigrants, have produced a drop in New York City's black population, according to preliminary census estimates. There were 30,000 fewer black residents in 2004 than in 2000.   A1    Charter Schools' Record  Supporters of charter schools say they bring innovators and new ideas into public education. But sometimes, that freedom allows school operators to get in over their heads. And when a charter school closes, as more than 400 have nationally -- including 5 in New York State -- it leaves a messy wake of heartbreak and anger.   A1    SPORTSMONDAY   D1-8    Duke and Maryland in Final  Maryland rode a feisty attitude and outstanding performances by forwards to an 81-70 victory against North Carolina in the national semifinals, and Duke overpowered Louisiana State with defense, shutting down the Lady Tigers' top player while the game was still in doubt and barreling to a 64-45 victory.   D1    Florida Players' Sports Genes  Third-seeded Florida, which began the year unknown and unranked, will play second-seeded U.C.L.A. in the national title game and is favored to win. It has been the most unlikely of seasons for the Gators, but the root of their success this season can be traced to the family trees of three starters.   D1    Yankees Could Lead in Brains  When the Yankees open the season against the Oakland Athletics, they will unveil Johnny Damon, the latest of their annual superstar imports. There are several new stars besides Damon this year, but they aren't players: General Manager Brian Cashman tried to assemble the best and the brightest for Joe Torre's coaching staff.   D1    ARTS   E1-8    Barbie's Big StageDebut  After 47 years as a plastic doll and six as an animated fairy-tale princess on the small screen, Barbie, the consummate pink icon of little-girlhood comes alive on stage in her first life show. The show, with traditional children's-theater interaction and 12 original songs, is Mattel's latest effort to buttress a brand battered by competition in recent years.

B6    BUSINESS DAY   C1-10    Alcatel and Lucent to Merge  Alcatel and Lucent said that they had reached agreement on a $13.4 billion merger, creating a French-American maker of telecommunications equipment with revenue of $25 billion, 88,000 employees and phone company customers across the world. The deal comes in response to the increasing competition Western telecommunications firms are facing.   C1    Condé Nast Expands on Web  Condé Nast, like many magazine publishers, is trying to build up its Web presence to keep up with a generation of readers who automatically turn to the Internet instead of the printed page. It is upgrading its bridal site, preparing another new site for teenage girls, and getting ready to publish a new business magazine that will have a large Internet component with original content.   C1    Deutsche Bank Resignation  Unable to shake a long-running legal dispute with a former client of his bank, the supervisory board chairman of Deutsche Bank, Rolf E.

Mr. Dale, who helped invent the surf-music genre in the late 1950's and early 60's, fit the audience's needs perfectly: he is a nearly forgotten figure whose music reflects the mania and voluminousness of American culture at that time.   Surf music, guitar-based and full of huge, whooshing sounds, is the expression of a certain type of innocent American modernity, pure California and pre-pollution, -Watergate and -Vietnam. Mr. Dale, playing a Fender Stratocaster, the quintessential American pop guitar, was hellbent on making noise. He ran his fingers up and down the fret board in long glissandos, sending shimmering metallic sounds out into the room. And he twanged away, letting the low notes ring like a jackhammer on a construction site. In pieces from his new album, \\"Tribal Thunder\\" (Hightone), Mr. Dale dipped into mambos and Arab scales, and he performed Juan Tizol's \\"Caravan\\" with flair.

Nixon has used word 'he' to describe rept that he personally used '68 campaign surplus in buying his houses; it appears likely that way funds were handled may have led to news articles that suggested Nixon had made personal use of these funds;

discusses published accts of Nixon's finances; sources state that Kalmbach's handling of money for Nixon Adm and its pol activities began in big way in early '69 when he was asked by M H Stans, finance chmn of that campaign, to act as trustee for some money that was left over; according to sources, Kalmbach took control of 2 safety deposit boxes that had $1,098,000 in cash and of checking accts for $570,000; when Kalmbach gave up control of money to '72 Finance Com to Re-Elect Pres on Feb 3 '72, there was $915,000 left and $233,000 of this was in cash;
