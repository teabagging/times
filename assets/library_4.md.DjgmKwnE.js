However, as the novelist Donald E. Westlake notes in his brief and perceptive foreword, there is indeed in the Thurber canon a surprising amount of material with at least a vague focus on crime. For example, a quick flip through these pages reveals that an impressive number of those familiar and artless Thurber cartoons deal with violence -- either actual or imminent. And there are several selections in which criminal investigations and trials are detailed with economy and arch wit. Couple these with a raft of short stories and parodies centering on everything from murder to kidnapping, and the editor, Robert Lopresti, a writer of crime fiction, has made his point. If the longest selection in the book tells us perhaps more about Thurber's beloved bloodhounds than we might wish to know, it does so with typical charm and skill. And among the five previously uncollected pieces is \\"The Man Who Knew Too Little,\\" a classic and delightful Thurberesque encounter with a stranger in a Paris cafe.

The most exciting moments are often when it does both at the same time, as ART BRUT, a proudly amateur band from London, did last year with a hilarious single, ''Formed a Band.'' Borrowing a bit of the neo-New Wave sound of groups like the Futureheads, the song self-consciously satirizes the joys of plugging in and making a huge splash -- ''We're gonna be the band that writes the song/ That makes Israel and Palestine get along,'' boasts the band's tuneless lead singer, Eddie Argos, amid other claims, like writing a song ''as universal as 'Happy Birthday.' ''    Playing with an exuberance that could not be a joke, Art Brut did indeed make a splash. Its debut album, ''Bang Bang Rock & Roll'' (Fierce Panda), is chock-full of high-energy odes to pretension, like ''Modern Art'' (''Modern art/ Makes me/ Want to rock out!''), that are as sarcastic as they are entirely sincere. The band makes its long-awaited New York debut this week with a sweep through the clubs.

James Sewell went straight to Home Depot in Minneapolis, where his company is based, and bought a chainsaw and a power drill for his new ''Guy Noir: The Ballet'' (above, Benjamin Johnson, one of the dancers). ''For years I've been wanting to do a ballet with a chainsaw,'' Mr. Sewell said. Guy Noir is a cigar-chomping radio detective created by Garrison Keillor, who wrote the ballet's script and narrates it on tape. The story involves a deadly dance contest at the ACME Tulle Company, and the plot unfolds to a jazz score that includes music by the Guy's All-Star Shoe Band. (The program also includes ''Involution,'' set to music by Thomas Newman, and ''Anagram,'' an improvisatory ballet set to Schubert.) Mr. Sewell, who trained at the School of American Ballet and performed with Eliot Feld, had wanted to do a Keillor ballet. Then, a few years ago, he got the perfect entree when the writer asked him to choreograph a can-can dance for men in tuxedos and sneakers for a gala for the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. The kickline included Mr. Keillor. What kind of dancer was he? ''He's very tall,'' Mr. Sewell said. ''A great big guy. He had complete commitment.'' Pause. ''He didn't screw up.'' Mr. Sewell and his wife, Sally Rousse, left New York in 1993, taking their company with them. What has Minneapolis got that New York doesn't? ''My 15 years in New York were not replaceable,'' he said. ''But I got to the point where I wanted to do my work with the least resistance. In New York, you need 20 to 50 percent more energy to get to base level, and 70 percent more energy and money to raise a family. And there's a real tradition here of philanthropy and of pushing the boundaries of art forms.''

Tuesday night, the Western Wind, an excellent and remarkably versatile ensemble, paid tribute to this heritage in the Abraham Goodman House with a program devoted to ''Music in the New World.''     The Western Wind, now in its 15th season, is an a cappella group consisting of the sopranos Ma Prem Alimo and Johana Arnold, the countertenor William Zukof, the tenors Lawrence Bennett and William Lyon Lee and the baritone Elliot Levine","excerpt":"Thursday night, they were joined by the bass Albert de Ruiter. What sets this ensemble apart is not only its eclecticism (half of a November concert will be devoted to the 12th-century musician Perotin, the other half to the maverick works of the contemporary composer Philip Glass) but also the musicality of its members.  Rather than attempt a sonic homogeneity, the members of the Western Wind seem to strive for a kaleidoscopic tapestry of vocal hues. The mixed voices do not so much blend together as actively complement one another, like different registers on a pipe organ. The singers have all but incredible pitch control, developed to the degree that it is possible for them to play around the edges of the notes, teasing upwards a quarter tone here and there, or sliding ever so slowly into a final resolution.

Weinberger intended to keep pressing to have Poland declared in default of its debts to the West and to prod Western European nations to halt their natural gas pipeline deal with Moscow. (Page A1, Column 6.) A group of hard-liners in Warsaw has emerged among Poland's rulers, Polish sources said. The strong conservative faction, they said, opposes any political reform, a revival of Solidarity as an independent union and any talks with Lech Walesa. (A3:1-3.) News Summary","excerpt":"THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1982"},{"year":"1984","title":"Markets    Stock prices plummeted in heavy trading.  The Dow Jones industrial average lost 24.19 points, the most in 15 months, ending at 1,156.30. The selloff was broadly based, but volume eased a bit, to 96.9 million shares. (Page D1.) The monthlong slide in share prices is being attributed to a sudden awareness of the ominous implications of the budget deficits. It contrasts sharply with earlier expectations of an election year rally buoyed by a lively economy. (A1.)   Interest rates were little changed in dull trading on the credit markets. An auction of $5.25 billion of 11 3/4 percent Treasury notes due in 1993 brought a yield of 11.70 percent. (D16.) Rates on six- month C.D.'s inched up nationally but slipped in New York. (D9.)

Broadway    +'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories. from traffic cones into megaphones to garbage bags into evening gowns. But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45).

BEN BRANTLEY    +'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' This alternately pallid and garish revival of the 1983 musical, with songs by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein, comes to life only when its cross-dressing chorus line takes over. This story of a gay couple who run a nightclub in St. Tropez has two bright stars in Daniel Davis (as the manly part of the couple) and the wonderful but slightly miscast Gary Beach (as the womanly one). But Jerry Zaks's production often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include canned corn and packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers. Each one emerges as a saucy individual, and as a team they have been choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with a feisty sense of humor and an athletic verve that should make Arnold Schwarzenegger think twice about using ''girly men'' as a pejorative term (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $100.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly a half-century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by an Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of theater and television fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.  BRANTLEY    *+'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice it, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow water(2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.  BRANTLEY    +'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience to prick up its ears. Heard not so long ago issuing from the plus-size form of Edna Turnblad in the musical ''Hairspray,'' Mr. Fierstein's voice is one of the most distinctive in theater, variously evoking a kazoo, a congested saxophone, wind in a bottle and echoes from a crypt. It is, in a way, its own multicolored show. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to David Leveaux's abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $100.  BRANTLEY    +'GEM OF THE OCEAN' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays chronicling the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is more than 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.  BRANTLEY    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and longtime Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house on Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, and featuring some funny riffs on familiar archetypes, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.  BRANTLEY    +++'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco (his last performance is Sunday), Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, who all manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    + 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure onstage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naif of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly as ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. (Think ''The Children's Hour'' crossed with ''Agnes of God.'') But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.  BRANTLEY    'FAT PIG' Neil LaBute's latest work is on one level yet another demonstration that men are paragons of bad faith and cowardice, a judgmental tradition that this writer established with his screenplay for ''In the Company of Men.'' Yet ''Fat Pig,'' directed by Jo Bonney, is also the most emotionally engaging and unsettling of Mr. LaBute's plays since ''Bash'' five years ago. A show that might have been merely a point-proving exercise is immeasurably enriched by Mr. LaBute's empathy and by the skill and honesty of Jeremey Piven (of ''The Entourage'' on HBO) as a charming rising executive, and and Ashlie Atkinson, the overweight woman he falls for. Andrew McCarthy and Keri Russell (late of ''Felicity'') round out the taut ensemble (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Gerard Alessandrini, the writer and creator of the 22-year-old ''Forbidden Broadway'' series of satirical revues, would seem to be as steamed-up and homicidal as Dirty Harry in a den of crooked cops. This means he is in particularly good form. The New York theater's favorite practitioner of tough love has put on the brass knuckles for this round. The production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars (Patti LuPone, Hugh Jackman). But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as Mr. Alessandrini's lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). Douglas Fairbanks Theater, 432 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8:15 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $49.50 to $57.  BRANTLEY    *'THE GODS ARE POUNDING MY HEAD! (AKA LUMBERJACK MESSIAH)' Even lumberjacks get the cosmic blues in the world of Richard Foreman, the Florenz Ziegfeld of avant-garde drama. In many ways, this show is a typical Foreman extravaganza: tightly orchestrated hallucinogenic visual effects, bruising slapstick and cryptic, fragmented dialogue. But there is also a newly wistful, elegiac note here. ''Gods,'' which features Jay Smith and T. Ryder Smith as a pair of weary woodsmen, is as majestically mad and funny as any Foreman spectacle. But it also has a sadness appropriate to what appears to be a farewell note of sorts, since Mr. Foreman has said he is giving up the kind of plays he has been creating since 1968 to focus on film (1:10). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, (212)533-4650. Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m. Tickets: weekdays $20, $15 for students; $25 for Saturday performances.  BRANTLEY    ++'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it is about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction There are circumcision jokes aplenty, of course, and the requisite zingers about controlling Jewish mothers. and their daughters who don't put out. Several bits are funny despite the familiarity, as when a mother unleashes a volley of questions at her prospective son-in-law with the speed and accuracy of an ace machine-gunner. Later, a woman's status as an imposter is revealed when it's recalled that she paid retail for the Chanel bag. So it goes for two hours. Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    'K.I. FROM CRIME' We can all bring to mind a list of literary characters it might be edifying to spend some time with, but Katerina Ivanovna, from ''Crime and Punishment,'' probably isn't on your list. A minor figure in the novel, she is the miserable, impoverished widow of a hopeless drunk. In a grim scene, she presides over a funeral banquet for her husband. Racked with a consumptive cough, she belittles the seedy guests who have bothered to show up, fumes at the indifference of the more respectable ones who haven't, bemoans the fate of her fatherless children. Now, thanks to the wonders of the contemporary stage, you're invited. Theatergoers who delight in audience participation will not want to miss the New York debut of the Lithuanian-born director Kama Ginkas. Audience members, who are conscripted into the roles of Katerina's guests, must listen patiently to her long tale of woe. But since most of the monologue is delivered in Russian, only those conversant with the language will grasp the nuances of her plight. Ms. Mysina gives a boldly physical, emotionally transparent performance, but there is no development of her character. And while it may seem paradoxical, involving an audience in a theatrical performance tends to lessen its impact. The self-consciousness that results shuts the lid on imaginative empathy (1:30). Freight Entrance Theater, 208 West 37th Street, Manhattan. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $40. Sold out for the run of the show.  ISHERWOOD    ++'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naive, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country. Bush foes expecting a polemical broadside will be disappointed. Ms. Raffo drew on more than 10 years of interviews to assemble her theatrical mosaic, and the commendable results reveal that she is a journalist, not a purveyor of propaganda. There is plenty here to fuel outrage at the suffering of Iraqi citizens directly caused by American bombing. But Ms. Raffo's women also bear witness to the monstrousness of Saddam Hussein's regime, with more than one of the play's characters fiercely avowing that no price is too high to pay for ridding the country of his brutality (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the show.  ISHERWOOD    'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Arliss Howard and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.  BRANTLEY    +'UNDER THE BRIDGE' Kathie Lee Gifford, best known for purveying chitchat on morning television, has re-emerged in showbiz behind the scenes, as the author of a new musical aimed at family audiences. ''Under the Bridge,'' with book and lyrics by Ms. Gifford and music by David Pomeranz, tells the heartwarming story of a spunky group of homeless children who befriend a cranky but lovable old bum. As his hard heart is softened, the urchins and their widowed mother find the home they've long dreamed of. A new family is born. All this in Paris, yet. As that precis suggests, in adapting a popular children's book by Natalie Savage Carlson, Ms. Gifford does not exactly strive tirelessly to avoid the clichéd. The score is competent if generic. Mr. Pomeranz's melodies are pleasant and neatly tailored, while Ms. Gifford's lyrics are doggedly rhymed if rarely graceful. Despite energetic performances all around (special kudos to the likable Ed Dixon as the hobo), Eric Schaeffer's production feels inert (2:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30; Saturdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sundays at 1 and 6 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    Last Chance    +'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudites. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed by David Schweizer as if it were a traffic jam, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. (''She may not want a Scotch, Brandon. It's not dark yet, and she's only half-WASP.'') But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. Today at 8 p.m.; tomorrow and Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.

Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone, the two times in his life when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, which preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'BEYOND THE SEA' Starring Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Directed by Mr. Spacey (PG-13, 118 minutes). The matching of two slithery chameleons, the singer Bobby Darin (who died in 1973 at the age of 37) and his latter-day doppelgänger, Mr. Spacey (now 45), sparks a weird bluish flame that suggests a wax yule log posing as wood in the season's teeming fireplace of movie biographies. When ignited, it releases acrid, waxy fumes that feel queasily chemical. The movie, which the star directed and helped write and in which he sings (wonderfully), smacks of the same kind of obsession that brought Bob Fosse's ''All That Jazz'' to creepy reptilian life. Its vision of show business in the 50's and 60's is as tawdry as Fosse's and as incisive in suggesting it's a grubby rags-to-riches circus. (Ms. Bosworth plays Sandra Dee, the bimbo movie princess Darin strenuously wooed and married.) The movie also touches on the ugly reality of show business mothers who force their children to act out their dreams and line their pocketbooks.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play yet exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The formal trickiness of the narrative strips the characters of any daily context that would give their emotions meaning, and the movie is a succession of scenes, some quite powerful on their own, that don't really add up to much. The actors work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen -- raw, brash and witty -- succeeds (and in the process takes away Mr. Law's ''Sexiest Man Alive'' title without much of a fight).  A.O. SCOTT    'COACH CARTER' Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown, Robert Ri'chard, Rick Gonzalez, Nana Gbewonyo and Antwon Tanner. Directed by Thomas Carter (PG-13, 137 minutes). In this solid, unsurprising inspirational-coach drama, Mr. Jackson plays Ken Carter, who returns to his old high school in the tough Northern California city of Richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners, both on and off the court. Based on a true story, the movie combines sports-picture suspense with heroic-educator uplift when Carter, dismayed that his players are slipping academically, padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season. Mr. Carter (the director, no relation to the coach) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism, which are bolstered by the hip-hop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members, especially Mr. Brown, as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities, Ashanti as his girlfriend, and Mr. Gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime.  SCOTT    'ELEKTRA' Starring Jennifer Garner, Terence Stamp, Kirsten Prout, Goran Visnjic, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Will Yun Lee. Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 96 minutes). The latest Hollywood movie to give comic books a bad name, ''Elektra'' stars Ms. Garner as a superheroine who dons fetish-wear the color of blood before laying waste to every man in sight. ''Your parents must have had a sense of humor,'' the broodingly handsome and plucky love interest says to Elektra about her mythopoetic name. She answers in the negative: no, they did not, and neither does she. This chick may have a complex (or two), but like the rickety vehicle supporting her and the hopes of Marvel Comics, she emphatically does not have a sense of humor. What she emphatically does have -- and this of course is the entire point of ''Elektra'' -- is a hot bod and a costume that looks as if it was designed by someone very familiar with the Victoria's Secret catalog.  DARGIS    'FAT ALBERT' Starring Kenan Thompson and Kyla Pratt. Directed by Joel Zwick (PG, 93 minutes). One of the truisms of contemporary pop culture is that just when you think it couldn't get any worse, its purveyors any more shameless, you are proved decisively wrong. Based on Bill Cosby's corpulent charmer and his band of brothers, the ''Fat Albert'' movie opens just days after the release of the DVD compilations of the original show. DVD's for the program are featured so prominently in the movie, and the movie feels so much like an extended-play sitcom, I half expected Mr. Cosby to pop up on screen to sell me the discs along with a Coke. From 1972 through 1984, the animated television series ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' enjoyed enormous success. The cartoon was austere but eminently watchable and featured one of those sitcom tunes that etch a permanent groove in your head. Just as memorable was Mr. Cosby's basso-profundo delivery of Fat Albert's trademark ''hey, hey, hey,'' a mantra that signaled that no matter what happened, all would be right in the end. In ''Fat Albert,'' that trademark is resurrected to depressingly diminished ends.  DARGIS    *'HEAD-ON' Starring Birol Unel, Sibel Kekilli, Catrin Striebeck and Guven Kirac. Directed by Fatih Akin (Not rated, 118 minutes). In German and Turkish, with English subtitles. Love doesn't just hurt in the jagged German romance ''Head-On''; it cuts and bleeds and even kills. A story about a lonely man and a still-lonelier woman fighting against their worlds and what often seems like their own best interests, the film has caused a stir in Germany for the murky, troubling light it sheds on the lives of the country's Turkish immigrants. Its popularity made it a fleeting social phenomenon and a minor cultural footnote. But it doesn't explain why this film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of this very young year. One of the truisms about romances, even those shaded pitch black and set to banging rock music, is that you have to fall in love with the characters when they're falling for each other. It takes a long time for Cahit (Birol Unel) and Sibel (Sibel Kekilli) to get inside each other's heads, much less anywhere else, but it doesn't take us long to care about this two perfectly imperfect beings.  DARGIS    'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller, based on fact, performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered into the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed in ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a hundred-day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.  HOLDEN    'IN GOOD COMPANY' Starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (PG-13, 106 minutes). This gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture, a site of our leading blood sport. Mostly, though, the movie is about men. The two men at the story's engaging center are Carter Duryea (Mr. Grace), a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of Sports America. The man whom Carter is meant to make redundant is the 51-year-old Dan Foreman, a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone. Dan has a picture-perfect family and is the kind of unabashedly old-fashioned masculine type Mr. Quaid has been slow-cooking to perfection over the years and which, on American screens at least, has lately gone missing.  DARGIS    'LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS' Starring Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman. Directed by Brad Silberling (PG, 108 minutes). Since the publication of the first installment in Lemony Snicket's (aka Daniel Handler's) charmingly malignant book cycle ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult to another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune. But now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature: their story has been turned into a major Hollywood movie -- and with Jim Carrey, no less.  DARGIS    'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and new species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Acquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations. The pleasures of this movie are like those of a beautifully illustrated, haphazardly plotted picture book, which precocious children (and nostalgic adults) can linger over, feeding their own reveries and fantasies.  SCOTT    'A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG' Starring John Travolta and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Shainee Gabel (R, 119 minutes). In this first feature directed by Ms. Gabel, Mr. Travolta delivers a hammed-up scenery-chewing variation of the brainy good ol' boy he played in ''Primary Colors.'' This is the story of a down-at-the-heels former star professor and his protégé rotting in the New Orleans house bequeathed them by a legendary folk-blues singer, and their partial redemption when the singer's alienated daughter comes to live with them. The film dawdles along aimlessly for two hours before coming up with a final revelation that is no surprise. The movie's hokey solemnity suggests ''The Mundane Secrets of the Ya-Ya Brotherhood'' or ''The Notebook Goes to the Big Easy.'' The movie is another example of Hollywood going soft and squishy when it goes South.  HOLDEN    'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr.Owen Wilson).  DARGIS    'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent intepretation from Mr. Radford and from a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that in evoking Velázquez, Rembrandt, Titian and Vermeer, immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.  SCOTT    'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio this year.  SCOTT    'MONSIEUR N' Starring Philippe Torreton, Richard E. Grant, Jay Rodan and Elsa Zylberstein. Directed by Antoine de Caunes (Not rated, 127 minutes). In French, with English subtitles. This densely plotted costume drama, which flashes back from the exhumation of Napoleon Bonaparte's body in 1840 Paris to the years leading up to his death in 1921 on the remote island of St. Helena, imagines that his official death might have been an elaborate hoax. The screenplay is peppered with Napoleon's epigrammatic zingers, which reveal him as the smartest person in the room. Mr. Torreton's glowering emperor exerts a magnetic if slightly repellent spell. Mr. Grant, as Hudson Lowe, the British governor in charge of the island, is almost as fine in the role of a raging control freak whose behavior is more stereotypically Napoleonic than Napoleon's. If the movie amounts to little more than a historical divertissement, it is well done.  HOLDEN    'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Julia Roberts, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in this enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick, a trio of crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues, and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean, played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which, given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction, is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box-office entertainment ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again, Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack; Mr. Pitt plays his second in command, Rusty Ryan; and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs. Also on board for the return trip are Julia Roberts, Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Eddie Jemison, Shaobo Qin and a delightful Carl Reiner, joined by the new recruit Catherine Zeta-Jones as Isabel, a European super cop who favors curve-hugging skirts and the sort of dangerous high heels women wear only so they can kick them off in the bedroom.  DARGIS    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Starring Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver. Directed by Joel Schumacher (PG-13, 143 minutes). ''Far too many notes for my taste,'' a minor character remarks, apropos of the threatening letters being sent by the micro-managing phantom. That pretty much sums up the problems with Andrew Lloyd Webber's bombastic score, the prentious clutter of which is well matched by Mr. Schumacher's production. For all the invocations of ''the angel of music,'' this film, adapted from the curiously popular stage musical, will most likely leave you with a devilish headache. The songs are unlistenable, which also makes them hard to sing, but Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler show some impressive vocal technique, and Ms. Rossum, in addition to being lovely, has enough movie star luminosity to avoid being buried in the busy sets and elaborate costumes. This 2-hour-and-20-minute barrage may drive you back to the 1925 version of ''Phantom,'' which starred Lon Chaney and which has many virtues. For one thing, it is short. For another, it's silent.  SCOTT    'SPANGLISH' Starring Adam Sandler, Téa Leoni and Paz Vega. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Brooks, one of the smartest and sunniest men in Hollywood, turns his attention to class division, cultural misunderstanding and marital discord in Los Angeles -- all subjects ripe for the kind of warm-hearted comedy in which he specializes and all of them treated with astonishing smugness and dishonesty. Mr. Sandler plays John Clasky, a successful chef who almost falls for his maid, Flor (Ms. Vega), a situation that Mr. Brooks rescues from sleaziness by making Jack's wife, Deborah (Ms. Leoni), a thoroughgoing monster: irredeemably selfish, vain and ridiculous. Deborah, a bad mother and a useless wife, serves as the film's scapegoat, and her demonization contrasts with the idealization of Flor in a way that manages to be both overtly misogynist and implicitly racist. Mr. Sandler smiles through it all, playing a nice guy who unwittingly personifies the film's self-adoring liberal bad faith.  SCOTT    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou, Gaspard Ulliel, Jean-Pierre Becker, Dominique Bettenfeld, Clovis Cornillac and Marion Cotillard. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, and directed by the cult favorite Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amelie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.  DARGIS    'WHITE NOISE' Starring Michael Keaton, Chandra West and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by Geoffrey Sax (PG-13, 101 minutes). A laugh-laced cheap thrill that has nothing to do with the Don DeLillo novel of the same title, ''White Noise'' was directed by Mr. Sax, whose résumé hopefully notes that this would-be auteur comes from a long and venerable line of BBC-trained directors. It is a long and venerable line that, on the evidence of his feature filmmaking debut, Mr. Sax may bring to an unintended end. It's impossible to say exactly who takes the brunt of the blame here, although the screenwriting credit belongs to Niall Johnson. Mr. Johnson apparently wrote ''White Noise'' in 2002, several years after the Japanese horror movie ''Ringu'' helped trigger the recent fad for Asian horror, and his script hinges on the premise that there are ghosts in the machine anxious to reach out and touch us. Often, the person on this side of the death divide is a spunky woman or a high school girl in a miniskirt and knee socks, but here the hero reaching across time, space and genre is played by Mr. Keaton.  DARGIS    'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.  SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    BOBBY BARE JR., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side (212)260-4700. Bobby Bare Jr. is an even more eccentric Nashville songwriter than his father was. His music can float down-home Americana in a psychedelic haze; his lyrics are blunt, unsentimental and pugnacious as he sings about the road and some down-and-out characters including himself. Tonight at 11:30, with Sarah Lee Guthrie and Johnny Irion at 9:30 and Hula at 8:30; admission is $10.  JON PARELES    BLUE OYSTER CULT, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144 and The Chance, 6 Crannel Street, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., (845)471-1966. When science fiction met heavy metal and light-hearted fetishism in Blue Oyster Cult songs of the 70's like \\"Cities on Flame With Rock 'n' Roll,\\" \\"(Don't Fear) the Reaper,\\" \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"Dominance and Submission,\\" it hardly mattered whether the band's original intentions were tongue-in-cheek. Its post-Zeppelin, pre-punk riffs, its wild-eyed lyrics and Buck Dharma's lead guitar lines still sound good. At B.B. King tonight at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $32. At the Chance tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $28.50.  PARELES    *TYONDAI BRAXTON, THE SOFT CIRCLE, ZS, ROB LOWE, PREFUSE 73, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. An appealing quintuple bill bringing together a crew of beats-and-noise-influenced eccentrics. Mr. Braxton uses effects and electronics and sometimes guitars to create resounding sounds and songs. The Soft Circle is the new project from Hisham Bharoocha, formerly of the (very) post-punk sound sculptors Black Dice. Zs is a band known for grand, saxophone-driven compositions. They are to be joined by Rob Lowe, the bass player from 90 Day Men (not, of course, the startlingly well-preserved star of the short-lived drama \\"Dr. Vegas\\"), and the producer Prefuse 73, who is to play a DJ set. Sunday night at 9; tickets are $10.  KELEFA SANNEH    CARLSONICS, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street below Stanton Street, (212)505-3733. Steeped in 1960's rock, the Carlsonics crosspollinate the Who, the Byrds and half a dozen garage bands for songs that revel in the way guitars work up to big, jubilant drones. Tomorrow night at 11, with American Watercolor Movement at midnight, Aloke at 10, Undersea Explosion at 9, Miniwatt at 8:30 and Pleasure Technicians at 7:30; admission is $8.  PARELES    D.J. LE SPAM AND THE SPAM ALL-STARS, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940. D.J. Le Spam's regular club shows became a sensation in Miami, where he mixed the electronic rhythms of dance-club music with live musicians steeped in Cuban salsa, and the balance has tipped toward the live band. S.O.B.'s has given him a New York outpost. Tonight at 11; tickets are $12  PARELES    *KENNY DOPE, APT, 419 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 414-4245. Kenny Dope, the hip-hop-obsessed half of the pioneering house duo Masters at Work, comes to this meatpacking-district bar for a party that's sure to be cramped and sweaty and exuberant. One of the unexpected pleasures of living in New York City is the opportunity to see big-name DJs in venues as small as this one. Tomorrow night after 10; admission is $8.  SANNEH    ROBERTA FLACK, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. Behind the gentle, tremulous voice that confided hits like \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" is long knowledge of the continuum of blues, gospel, soul and jazz. Ms. Flack can use just a touch of rawness to make her songs hit home. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $48.50 in advance, $52 tomorrow.  PARELES    BUDDY GUY, LITTLE MILTON, THE HOWLIN' WOLF BAND, THE MUDDY WATERS BAND, ROBERT JR. LOCKWOOD, DAVID HONEYBOY EDWARDS, Avery Fisher Hall, Broadway at 65th Street, (212)731-6500. This all-star bill follows the blues from the Delta to Chicago, with spiky Mississippi blues from David Honeyboy Edwards and a jazz-tinged version of it by Robert Jr. Lockwood, who learned directly from Robert Johnson (hence the Jr.). Then come the Chicago electric blues, with two bands of alumni who backed Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, including James Cotton on harmonica and Pinetop Perkins on piano. The headliner, Buddy Guy, is a high-adrenalin bluesman who wrings drama from every speed-fingered guitar line and vocal rasp, and he'll be joined by the ever suave Little Milton. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $35 to $90.  PARELES    *KRISTIN HERSH/BEN WEAVER, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. Kristin Hersh was the songwriter behind the jumpy, oddly cantilevered tunes and surreal imagery of Throwing Muses. Motherhood and perspective have made her songs more serene, though barely less enigmatic, and lately she has been touring with her hardest-rocking group yet, 50 Foot Wave. This is an acoustic solo set. Ben Weaver promises, \\"I'm not gonna give you what you want to hear,\\" unless that happens to be hard-won, country-rooted Americana full of weary determination and aphoristic clarity, somewhere between the Band and Tom Waits. Tomorrow and Sunday nights at 7; admission is $15.  PARELES    REID PALEY TRIO, CBGB, 315 Bowery at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052. Reid Paley pounds basic chords and bellows his songs as he plays the role of the hard-drinking misanthrope, aiming for the perfect combination of self-pity and spite. Tonight at 8 on a bill with American Ambulance, the Droves, Kings County Queens, Peg Simone and Curtis Eller. Admission is $10.  PARELES    POPA CHUBBY PLAYS HENDRIX, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. Popa Chubby hails from the Bronx, but his heart is in steamy, rambunctious blues and 1960's blues-rock. For this show, he's playing Jimi Hendrix songs. Sunday night at 8; admission is free.  PARELES    THE IDAN RAICHEL PROJECT, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824. The Israeli musician Idan Raichel moved from session work to a solo career in 2002, and his debut album zoomed to No.1 in Israel. His two album mix electronic loops, ethnic samples and hints of anything from reggae to lounge music to Ethiopian singing to pop ballads sung in Hebrew. His music can be simultaneously peripatetic and introspective. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $30 to $55.  PARELES    TOSHI REAGON AND BIG LOVELY, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. Singing about both love and politics with the same sense of independence, Toshi Reagon applies her gutsy voice and syncopated guitar playing to songs steeped in blues and funk. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9:30; tickets are $20.  PARELES    ROGER SANCHEZ, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. Mr. Sanchez, a local DJ and producer, helped invent contemporary New York dance music, occasionally adding Latin rhythms to his clattering house-inspired beats. Ever since his 2002 award for a No Doubt remix, he's invariably called a \\"Grammy-winning DJ,\\" although that title seems like faint praise. Last year he issued \\"Release Yourself Vol. 3\\" (Stealth), an appealing double-disc mix that starts with gauzy, disco-influenced mood music and ends with Carl Kennedy's buoyant and precise house track, \\"The Love You Bring Me.\\" Tomorrow night after 10; tickets are $20 in advance, $30 at the door.  SANNEH    *MARTIN SEXTON/JILL SOBULE, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. The singer and songwriter Martin Sexton can groan like an alternative rocker, slide like a soul man or leap up to a pearly falsetto. Singing about restlessness and love while he picks syncopations on his guitar, he can turn an ordinary song into a jazzy showcase, and a good one into a transmission from the heart. Jill Sobule's 1995 hit, \\"I Kissed a Girl,\\" showed her light-hearted side, but her girlish voice and folk-pop arrangements can be subterfuge, as she ponders love, time and human nature. She knows that simplicity and innocence aren't necessarily the same. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $28.75 in advance, $30 the day of the show.  PARELES    TOMMY STINSON, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. The most famous tonsils in rock belong to Tommy Stinson, who was the wild-card lead guitarist in the Replacements when they belted \\"Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out.\\" His resume also includes a stint in the latter-day Guns N' Roses and his own more introspective solo album. Tomorrow night at 11, with the Black Spoons at 10, Todd Deatherage at 9 and the Victoria Lucas at 8; admission is $10.  PARELES    THE UNSANE, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. Formed in 1988, the Unsane play intransigent hard rock: a chain of burly, asymmetrical riffs behind distorted vocal imprecations. Tonight at 9, with Monumentals, Lamont and Penny Winblood; admission is $10.  PARELES    LIZZIE WEST, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212)533-2680. Lizzie West sings folk-rocking songs about love, family and wanderlust, with a warm, reedy voice reminiscent of Natalie Merchant. Tonight at 9:30, sharing a bill with Lucy Woodward; admission is $12.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    *BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.  HOLDEN    UTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)570-7189. This imperious, Dietrich-like cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through Feb. 26, lends the entire nightclub enterprise a German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum.  HOLDEN    *'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra''' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30; $20 at the bar; $10 minimum.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    *GERI ALLEN TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. Since the 1980's, like so many other jazz bandleaders, the pianist Geri Allen has diversified, making records that wind through folk and rock and lullabies. But she's also laid down a remarkable track record making straightforward trio albums with first-rate drummers and bassists. Her latest, ''The Life of a Song'' (Telarc), with the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Jack DeJohnette, picks up this thread, and it's her best album in years. She'll undoubtedly play some of her new trio music this weekend, with the bassist Darryl Hall and the drummer Jimmy Cobb. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.  BEN RATLIFF    HAROLD ARLEN CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212)475-8592. In which singers -- including Ann Hampton Callaway, Paula West, Dena DeRose, Andy Bey and Grady Tate -- and a solid straight-ahead jazz band interpret some of the better songs of the 20th century, all written by one man. (Possible candidates: ''Blues in the Night,'' ''I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues,'' ''My Shining Hour,'' ''A Sleepin' Bee.'') Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $25 at the tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.  RATLIFF    BRUCE BARTH TRIO, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212)885-7000. Mr. Barth, who has made a series of fine if overlooked records since leaving Terence Blanchard's group a decade ago, is a reliable index of what the best of modern, mainstream jazz piano playing sounds like. A moderate, organized player, he swings as much as possible and doesn't let the music get away from him. But he also brings a degree of percussive aggression to the music, which sounds even more powerful inside these boundaries. His trio includes the bassist Doug Weiss and the drummer Montez Coleman. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:45; cover charge is $15, and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    *'GREAT LATIN JAZZ VOCALISTS' WITH THE LINCOLN CENTER AFRO-LATIN JAZZ ORCHESTRA, Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212)721-6500. Recently organized and working under the umbrella of Jazz at Lincoln Center, this ensemble is led by the pianist Arturo O'Farrill. Its stated mission is to play not only the work of the great Latin jazz orchestras like Machito's and Tito Puente's, but also music from South America and elsewhere in the Caribbean. It's a big step for the recognition and canonization of Latin jazz, and the project is starting off on the right foot. This concert spotlights the great singers of Latin jazz, and the guests include Graciela, of Machito's band, as well as the newer jazz vocalist Claudia Acuña and the marvelous salsa singer Herman Olivera. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Tickets: $10 to $150.  RATLIFF    CHARLES GAYLE, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, between Metropolitan Avenue and North Third Street, Williamsburg, (718)218-6934. A hard-blowing, occasionally brilliant tenor saxophonist, Mr. Gayle was notorious in the early 1990's as the living redux of the first free-jazz era; more recently he has pulled back from the precipice a bit. Tonight at 10; no cover charge or minimum.  RATLIFF    ARI HOENIG TRIO, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)675-6056. In the group led by the pianist Jean-Michel Pilc, the drummer Ari Hoenig can be as manic and furious as the bandleader; in other contexts he can lay back. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 10:30, midnight, 1:30 and 2:30; cover charge is $10.  RATLIFF    STEFON HARRIS'S BLACKOUT, Dizzy's Club, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212)258-9595. Arriving on the jazz scene in the late 1990's and becoming a worthwhile bandleader in a great hurry, the vibraphonist Stefon Harris has started to concern himself with reaching new audiences: his latest group is colored by synthesizer and powered by funk. But it still adheres to many of jazz's principles of interaction. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    LATIN PERCUSSION SUMMIT, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155. A gathering of some of the great Latin-music percussionists of several different generations, including the congueros Carlos (Patato) Valdes, Candido Camero and Ray Barretto, and the timbalero Nicky Marrero. Sets tomorrow night are at 8 and 10; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    *GREGOIRE MARET TRIO, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212)242-1063. On bandstands run by Jimmy Scott, Cassandra Wilson, Steve Coleman and others, this Swiss chromatic harmonica player has been extraordinary, pushing through solos with incantatory power. Don't worry about the novelty of his instrument; Mr. Maret gives it all the gravity it needs. This is a new group, with the guitarist Charlie Hunter and the percussionist Mino Cinelu. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 a set, $10 for members.  RATLIFF    JIMMY McGRIFF, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue, at 125th Street, Harlem, (212)427-0253. Mr. McGriff came from the golden period of Hammond B-3 organ playing, starting out in the early 1960's; he helped create the durable American archetype of soul-jazz. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, 10 and 11:30; cover charge is $25, and there is a one-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    *JASON MORAN AND BANDWAGON, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. The imaginative young pianist's new album, ''Same Mother'' (Blue Note), busies itself with the blues -- not just the blues structure in jazz, but the blues. The results are probably not what you have in mind. In beguiling new music (with the guitarist Marvin Sewell added to his regular trio to see it through), he flirts with a durable idiom that could easily eclipse his own; instead, the music turns out stubborn and almost perversely personal, with a thousand edges. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night. The cover charge is $25; $20 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    NICHOLAS PAYTON TRIBUTE TO MILES DAVIS, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)582-2121. The trumpeter Nicholas Payton first grabbed the jazz world's attention with his remarkable feeling for early New Orleans jazz, and more recently made an obstinately spaced-out funk record, but he's spent most of his professional time dealing with the rich languages of post-1960 jazz. Here he'll be mining that territory alongside his best foil, the saxophonist Tim Warfield, as well as the bassist Vicente Archer, the pianist Scott Kinsey, the drummer Adonis Rose and the percussionist Danny Sadownick. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $35 tonight and tomorrow night, $32.50 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum all nights .  RATLIFF    JEFF (TAIN) WATTS BAND, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. Mr. Watts, who played with Wynton Marsalis's group through the 1980's and continues to play with Branford Marsalis, is one of the most influential, important and complete drummers of the last two decades. His attack can be monsoonlike, but he knows the value of open space, and he can take over a band with a simple, slow-building pattern. The group this weekend includes the pianist David Budway, the bassist Eric Revis, the guitarist Paul Bollenback and the saxophonist Yosvany Terry. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    MADAMA BUTTERFLY The Puccini favorite returns to the Met after a mid-season hiatus. Giancarlo del Monaco's unreconstructed production plays the opera straight, with storybook images of rural Japan delivered without a trace of irony. The singers who opened the opera this past fall have returned to fill the principal roles. Cio-Cio-San is sung by Kallen Esperian, who gave an attractive and affecting performance back in September, save some insecurity in her upper range. Roberto Aronica returns as Pinkerton, a role that he sang more convincingly than he acted on opening night. And Vassily Gerello will again sing Sharpless, one hopes with the subtlety and luster he displayed earlier this season. Emmanuel Villaume conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200.  JEREMY EICHLER    PELLÉAS ET MÉLISANDE The cast looks very promising for the Met's revival of Jonathan Miller's haunting 1995 production of ''Pelléas et Mélisande,'' Debussy's masterpiece of emotional ambiguity and murky Impressionistic harmony, a story of powerfully illicit love. The rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter sings the frightened and evasive Mélisande and the ardent tenor William Burden sings Pelléas, the aimless, impulsive young man who falls hopelessly in love with her, though she is unhappily married to his half-brother, Golaud. Singing Golaud is the ageless bass-baritone José van Dam, who recorded the role under the conductor Herbert von Karajan in 1978. James Levine, who reveres this score, will conduct. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    TURANDOT The American soprano Andrea Gruber takes on the daunting title role of Puccini's ''Turandot'' in the Met's revival of Franco Zeffirelli's gargantuan and glittering 1987 production, so popular that it is critic-proof. Ms. Gruber has been singing some formidable repertory since returning to the fold of the Met in 2001, and her enormous voice shows signs of wear and stridency. Still, her singing is fearless and impassioned and through sheer force of will she excels in the role. The tenor Johan Botha is a heroic Calàf; the soprano Krassimira Stoyanova brings affecting vulnerability and throbbing richness to the role of Liù. Bertrand de Billy conducts a colorful and exciting account of Puccini's final opera. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Sold out; returns may be available at the box office.  TOMMASINI    Classical Music    *ARTEK Monteverdi has become one of this period-instrument band's specialties; for Artek's contribution to Music Before 1800's 30th season, it is presenting arias, duets and ensemble pieces from Monteverdi three extant operas, ''L'Orfeo,'' ''Il Ritorno d'Ulisse'' and ''L'Incoronazione di Poppea.'' Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights. (212)666-9266. Tickets: $25 to $40; $20 to $35 for students and 62+.  ALLAN KOZINN    FOCUS FESTIVAL The grand finale of this year's Focus Festival brings forth some of the festival's bigger guns tonight at the Juilliard Theater. The Juilliard Symphony will be conducted by the eminent Dutch musician and new-music sympathist Reinbert de Leeuw. The composers are Shostakovich (Symphony No. 15) and Sofia Gubaidulina (''Stimmenverstummen''). The festival's subtitle and main text is ''Breaking the Chains'' with music by Soviet composers not much in favor at home during the first half of the last century. Some were always well known, some have become so, and others remain nonhousehold names. Tonight at 8, Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)769-7406. Tickets are free but must be picked up at the Juilliard box office.  BERNARD HOLLAND    MAYUKO KAMIO Given the notoriously long brunch lines on Manhattan's Upper West Side, it's no surprise that Lincoln Center has found an eager audience for its series of short Sunday morning concerts followed by a reception with the artists. This weekend Mayuko Kamio, a young violinist with a mature temperament and impressive technique, performs a program of popular music by Brahms, Beethoven and Waxman, as well as a new work by Ako Yasuraoka. Sunday at 11 a.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $20.  EICHLER    LAHTI SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Osmo Vanska, who generated great excitement in his first season as music director of the Minnesota Orchestra and is undoubtedly doing the same in his second, comes calling instead with the Finnish ensemble that put him on the map. (Or was it the reverse? Or both?) You will probably not hear any time soon a more idiomatic and compelling reading of a Sibelius symphony than the performance of the Second here. The program also includes Sibelius's ''Pohjola's Daughter'' and two piano concertos seldom heard in concert, Tchaikovsky's Third and Prokofiev's First, with Louis Lortie as soloist. Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $35 to $68.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA As Pierre Boulez nears his 80th birthday, in March, the orchestra is celebrating with him at Carnegie Hall. In the second program, tonight, Mr. Boulez, the most analytical and scientific of conductors, puts Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' on the dissecting table, presenting a discussion illustrated by musical examples played live. It will undoubtedly hold revelations for hardened listeners, as it surely will for novices. In the second half, Mr. Boulez, who has long shown particular mastery of this score, conducts it complete. He leads it again tomorrow but replaces the chat of the first half with performances of his own ''Dérive 2'' and Stravinsky's Symphonies of Wind Instruments. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: tonight, $10 to $35; tomorrow, $27 to $102.  OESTREICH    MET ORCHESTRA James Levine and his Met Orchestra continue their busy Sunday afternoon schedule at Carnegie Hall and bring the splendid bass-baritone José van Dam as guest. He will sing Mozart, Mendelssohn (from ''Elijah'') and three of Mahler's Rückert Lieder. The orchestra continues its mini-tribute to Weber with the Overture to ''Der Freischütz.'' It also indulges Mr. Levine's taste for Webern, with the Symphony, Op. 21, and continues its strong support of Charles Wuorinen, playing his ''Grand Bamboula.'' The afternoon ends with the Dvorak Eighth Symphony, a piece these players did so resplendently a few years back. Sunday at 3 p.m. at Carnegie Hall. (212)247-7800. Tickets: $39 to $155.  HOLLAND    MUSIC OFF THE WALLS This series features thematic concerts by members of the Brooklyn Philharmonic tied to exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum. In the first event of this season, musicians will perform a program titled ''Image and Time,'' with works by Dvorak, Virgil Thomson and Ira Mowitz as well as the premiere of ''Voices from the Gallery'' by the prolific composer Stephen Paulus. The program is designed to complement the museum's exhibition ''About Time: 700 Years of European Painting,'' and a tour of the show is offered before the concert. Ken Selden conducts. Tomorrow at 3 p.m., Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Auditorium, Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)636-4100. Tickets: $15.  EICHLER    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC The Philharmonic's music director, Lorin Maazel, is currently in residence and offers at this week's subscription concerts Honneger's tribute to railroad engineering, ''Pacific 231,'' and Ravel's homage to the ballet and the exotic, the ''Daphnis et Chloé'' complete. Off both these beaten tracks will be Rachmaninoff's First Piano Concerto with Stephen Hough as pianist. Tomorrow night at 8 at Avery Fisher Hall. (212) 721-6500. Available tickets: $25 to $90.  HOLLAND    PETER ORTH It is unfair to claim that tickets to classical music concerts are prohibitively expensive for most New Yorkers when the Peoples' Symphony Concerts series thrives. Individual tickets are $9, less than you pay for a movie. And the performers who appear are always top-notch, like the pianist Peter Orth, who plays a recital tomorrow night in the inviting auditorium of Washington Irving High School. Since winning first prize at the 1979 Naumburg competition, Mr. Orth has had an active career and made a specialty of dazzling Romantic era repertory. On this program he plays Mendelssohn's tumultuous ''Variations Sérieuses,'' and six pieces from Albéniz's alluring and technically daunting ''Iberia.'' Tomorrow night at 8, Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street,, Manhattan, (212)586-4680. Tickets: $9, $11.  TOMMASINI    TAKACS QUARTET Decca Records has just released the final installment of this half-Hungarian, half-English ensemble's Beethoven quartet cycle, and to celebrate, the group is performing the complete series at Alice Tully Hall. Its programs mix works from Beethoven's early, middle and late styles. A chronological approach may make more sense for listeners intent on following the composer's journey, but for listeners who aren't taking in the full series, the Takacs's approach has the virtue of showing Beethoven's development in microcosm within each concert. The program tonight includes the works in B-flat (Op. 18, No. 6), C (Op. 59, No. 3) and the final quartet, the F major (Op. 135). On Sunday, the ensemble ends its series with the Quartet in F (Op. 59, No. 1) and a reprise of the Quartet in B flat (Op. 130), which was performed in the opening concert with Beethoven's shorter finale, and will be played here in the version that includes the ''Grosse Fugue'' (Op. 133). Tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $30 to $42 tonight; Sunday is sold out, but returned tickets may be available at the box office.  KOZINN    JOHN ZORN Having presented all of this quirky, inventively eclectic composer's string quartets in early 2003, Miller Theater is keeping up with the cycle by including his latest quartet, called ''Necronomicon,'' as part of a Composer Portrait concert. Included as well is the world premiere of ''Mysterium,'' six-movement work for a mixed ensemble of strings, woodwinds, percussion and electronics. There is never much point guessing what new works by Mr. Zorn will sound like: his influences are so wide-ranging that a work might include several varieties of jazz, klezmer, metal and synagogue chant, all woven together with a sense of evolved gamesmanship. The performers are Tara Helen O'Connor, flutist; Michael Lowenstern and Tim Smith, clarinetists; William Winant, percussionist; June Han, harpist; Stephen Gosling, keyboardist; Jennifer Choi and Jesse Mills, violinists; Richard O'Neill, violist; Fred Sherry, cellist; and Ikue Mori, seeing to the live electronics. Tonight at 8, Miller Theater at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $20; students, $12.  KOZINN    Dance    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance.    MARIANA BEKERMAN DANCE COMPANY In ''Shameless,'' Mariana Bekerman, a choreographer born in Odessa, Ukraine, comments on the childlike nature of purity and play. Kevin Keller contributes an original score. The dance episodes range from an evocation of a nightmare to scenes involving mushrooms as phallic symbols and Hula-Hoops as guides. Tonight at 9, tomorrow at 8 p.m., Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, West Village, (718)445-4028. Tickets: $17.  JACK ANDERSON    BUGLISI/FOREMAN DANCE Jacqulyn Buglisi and Donlin Foreman, two former members of the Martha Graham Dance Company, offer a season of premieres and selected pieces from their varied repertory. Among the new works for their sleek troupe is Ms. Buglisi's ''Conversation,'' the first in a planned series of dances exploring social issues with a taped collage of women's voices from around the world (tonight and Sunday afternoon). Mr. Foreman offers two premieres: ''Gravel Bed,'' a commentary on isolation and humanity's ability to overcome it (also tonight and Sunday afternoon) and ''Dream,'' to a score by David Lang for solo cello, to be played by Maya Beiser (tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon). Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800. Tickets: $38.  ANDERSON    COOL NEW YORK 2005 DANCE FESTIVAL Work by 60 dance companies will be showcased in this free two-week festival. If past marathons at this handsome and inviting little studio theater are a guide, any one performance in this first festival weekend will bring you an invigorating mix of the sublime, the professional and the truly terrible, with a couple of great new finds along the way. And the price is certainly right. Tonight at 7 and 9; tomorrow at 2 (family matinee), 7 and 9 p.m.; Sunday at 4 and 6 p.m.; White Wave's John Ryan Theater, 25 Jay Street, at John Street and the waterfront, under the Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn (718)855-8822 or www.whitewavedance.com (information only; no reservations).  JENNIFER DUNNING    E MOTION: NEW ASIAN AMERICAN DANCEWORK This program of all-Japanese hip-hop dance will feature the Bi-TriP troupe, grand champions at Amateur Night at the Apollo. The members fuse hip-hop, jazz, ethnic dance and elements, they say, of mime and illusion. The company directors promise to inspire, entertain and amaze, and we believe them. Tomorrow night at 8, Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, Queens, (718)463-7700, Ext. 222, or www.flushingtownhall.com. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    'FOOD FOR THOUGHT' Dancers seems to be among the most generous of artists. This yearly benefit to support neighborhood food distribution programs will feature three presentations of dance, chosen by Miguel Gutierrez (tonight), Nami Yamamoto (tomorrow) and Heidi Latsky (Sunday). Work by eight choreographers under 23 will be presented tonight. Ms. Yamamoto presents work by Linda Austin, Cynthia Oliver, Peter Schmitz and the yummy-sounding Yummy Dance. And Sunday's program features dance by former New Yorkers. Tonight through Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212)674-8194. Tickets: $10; $5 with two cans of food.  DUNNING    KEELY GARFIELD Ms. Garfield combines a blithe, dark sense of humor and a fascination with knotty emotional issues. In this program of new dances, she examines twins torn asunder and the reckless entrance and tormented exit wounds of love and estrangement. Whew. Today and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077. Tickets: $25.  DUNNING    PARALLEL EXIT The company will present ''Powerhouse,'' described as a dance-theater stage cartoon inspired by the films ''City Lights'' and ''An American in Paris,'' and set to music recorded by the jazz ensemble the Raymond Scott Orchestrette. Today through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo Theater, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479. Tickets: $10; $8 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry. and in one astonishing small sculpture, a human face splits apart to reveal the ages of man. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  HOLLAND COTTER    'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718)638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  KEN JOHNSON    'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The symbols of wealth, status and sexuality run from the maximal white swan's-down coat, plucked from male swan breasts and owned by Marlene Dietrich, to the minimal bikini recently wrought of badger fur by Jordan Betten, a reprise of the next-to-nothing get-up that revealed most of Raquel Welch in the 1966 film ''One Million Years B.C.'' The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. But whether or not you dig the notion of ''faunal apparel,'' as its organizers refer to outside skins, the show has this to impart: from the moment you encounter the entryway exhibit, a Ziegfeldlike mannequin on a trapeze swing dramatically enveloped by a Roberto Cavalli cascade of pink ostrich feathers, to the outrageous Stephen Jones hat adorned with a crocodile head in the last case, you are on message that fashion is theater, and sometimes theater of the absurd. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65 +, $10; students, $7.  GRACE GLUECK    Galleries: Uptown    ROSWELL ANGIER, Gitterman, 170 East 75th Street, (212)734-0868, through Jan. 29. In the early 1970's, this photographer explored a Boston netherworld called the Combat Zone where strip joints and other sex-related businesses flourished. His documentary pictures of strippers and pimps are not sensational but matter-of-fact, tender and sad. A more recent series studying street and bar life in Native American border towns in the Southwest is similarly humane and visually poetic.  JOHNSON    MILTON AVERY: 'ONRUSHING WAVES,' Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212)794-0550, through Jan. 29. The sea was always a painterly challenge for Avery (1885-1965) who saw it as a landscape of forms in endless free motion. This show of his seascapes from the 1920's through the 50's, meant to focus on his treatment of the ocean in its many moods, includes paintings, watercolors and a selection of his sketchbooks recording trips to seaworthy places. The best of the canvases here are the later ones, larger and much closer to abstraction, done in Provincetown summers. ''Onrushing Wave,'' which gives the show its title, is a white field stroked with horizontal dashes of off-blue; in the foreground is a mountainous white crest that confronts the viewer head on, vertically striated with the same blue. At the painting's bottom, rows of tiny blue ripples giver whispering echo to the upheaval above them. These works stay fresh no matter how often you've seen them.  GLUECK    JOEL SHAPIRO, Cook Fine Art, 1063 Madison Avenue, near 81st Street, (212)737-3550, through Feb. 25. This is a fine, economical retrospective of the post-Minimalist sculptor's career. There are not any of the early diminutive houses but there is a small, toy-like bronze horse from 1973-4 that may surprise viewers familiar with Mr. Shapiro's oeuvre. Also on hand are dense, blocky abstract sculptures in painted wood and in bronze and elegant, sumptuous geometric drawings on paper in velvety charcoal and vividly colored pastels.  JOHNSON    Galleries: 57th Street    SUZANNE CAPORAEL: 'READING TIME,' Greenberg Van Doren Gallery, 730 Fifth Avenue at 57th Street, (212)445-0444, through Feb. 12. A very accomplished painter, Ms. Caporael has made even more minimal the elegant painterly means she employs for her landscapes and figures. With poetic use of color, she evokes rather than defines imagery, by means of simple bands and bars of stroked paint. A high point is an evocation of the sea, made by a wonderful orchestration of strokes in various blues and lavenders on a gray ground, by which she brings into being a restlessly heaving body of water. She can can be witty, too, stacking strokes horizontally to produce the image of a personage (male) in a green sweater.  GLUECK    JIM GOLDBERG: 'TWO STORIES,' Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212)759-7999, through Feb. 5. For a series of photographic portraits called ''Rich and Poor'' that he made in the late 70's and early 80's, Mr. Goldberg had his visibly rich or poor subjects write their thoughts on the prints. The vivid sense of real persons that emerges is as compelling as anything you might learn about wealth or poverty. Another project, a kind of wrap-around bulletin board, is obscurely autobiographical.  JOHNSON    KEITH SONNIER, PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212)421-3292, through Feb. 5. The best new works by this veteran light sculptor consist only of glowing, loosely gestural colored neon lines connected by black wires to small black transformer boxes. They are lovely, but in light of all the new technologies abounding in today's art, there is something quaint about them. You may feel a twinge of nostalgia for a time when neon promised a future far brighter than the one we got.  JOHNSON    'STROKE!' Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082, through March 12. Believing that aesthetics trumped politics, the black artists Beauford Delaney, Norman Lewis and Alma Thomas held fast to their commitment to abstraction despite pressure from activists to produce more accessible Social Realism. Brought together here, their paintings from the 1960's and 70's make an arresting combo: Delaney's light-struck canvases, covered with tiny wriggling strokes of luminous colors laid on a solid ground; Lewis's fields of glowing color invaded by ghostly calligraphic forms, Thomas's broken lines of rich color arranged in geometric patterns. The works play off each other to lyrical effect.  GLUECK    'VIEW EIGHT: A FEW DOMESTIC OBJECTS INTERROGATE A FEW WORKS OF ART,' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212)752-2929, through Feb. 26. This canny show of artworks and objects of design includes Josiah McElheny's curvy mirrored coffee table bearing mirrored blobby objects; beautiful blobby ceramic sculptures by Ken Price; delicate, biomorphic hanging lights by Leionel Theodore Dean; a twisted, retro-futuristic orange bench by Sachio Hihara; and, like the nightmare that domestic utopianism tries to insulate us from, one of Lee Bontecou's early, scarily militaristic reliefs.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    THOMAS ALLEN: 'UNCOVERED,' Foley, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212)244-9081, through Feb. 5. Mr. Allen creates ''pop-up'' scenarios by cutting and folding selected figures from the covers of old paperbacks and other books; he then makes surprisingly dimensional color photographs of them. The screaming man at the top of a leaning stack of books looks like he is about to fall off a cliff. In ''Thirst,'' a sultry woman reaches from the cover of one book for the liquor bottle held by the man on a nearby volume.  JOHNSON    CHARLOTTE BECKET, Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)924-0212, through Feb. 5. Ms. Becket's ''Wishing Well'' is a notable contribution to the department of extreme trash accumulation, kinetic division. Stacked tiers of paper, cardboard, bottles and other sorts of refuse sandwiched between sheets of plywood rise 10 feet in the air. In the middle of this tower of garbage, a vertical conveyor continuously churns up loose debris. It owes a lot to the work of Phoebe Washburn but has its own wacky humor and inventiveness.  JOHNSON    EMILE GUEBEHI AND MALICK SIDIBE, Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212)645-1701, through Feb. 5. Lively studio portraits from 40 years and curious new photographs of heavy women seen from behind by Mr. Sidibe, the celebrated photographer from Mali, nicely complement the striking painted sculptures by the Ivory Coast-based Mr. Guebehi. Representing big, buxom women naked or partly naked and, in some cases, visibly pregnant, the sculptures look like the works of a self-taught artist with a thing for maternal women.  JOHNSON    KENT HENRICKSEN: 'SEASON OF DELIGHT,' John Connelly, 526 West 26th Street, (212)337-9563, through Feb. 12. By means of his own embroidery, Mr. Henricksen outfits with hoods, masks and leashes the amorous ladies, swains and cherubs that cavort across swatches of store-bought, faux-Rococo tapestry. His comical additions bring out sadomasochistic shadows obscured by conspiracies of innocence. Purple carpeting and yellow Rococo wallpaper designed by the artist enhance the giddily decadent mood.  JOHNSON    JAMES HYDE; RACHEL BERWICK, Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-2262, through Feb. 5. Mr. Hyde presents rectilinear wall-hung compositions made of raw lumber, chromed steel panels, clear vinyl, paint, photographs and other materials in his continuing, rigorously playful analysis of formalism, materialism and Modernist painting. Ms. Berwick's vivid wall-size video portraits of a rare Galapagos tortoise and a life-size cast in volcanic glass of a tortoise shell obliquely explore the intersection of natural and human histories.  JOHNSON    OAN KIM, The Annex, 601 West 26th Street, (646)638-3785 , through Feb. 5. Two kinds of street photography, both persuasive, are presented in this exhibition of recent work by a Paris-based photographer. In large format, panoramic color prints, the bedazzled, off-kilter, intensely congested urban views suggest a nearly psychedelic disorientation. On the other hand, the more formally ordered, book-size black and white prints depicting mostly abandoned spaces and occasional lone pedestrians project an infectious poetic melancholy.  JOHNSON    CHRISTIAN MARCLAY: 'SHAKE RATTLE AND ROLL (FLUXMIX),' Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through Feb. 5. In an installation by an artist known for hybridizing art and music, each of 16 video monitors in a circle show white-gloved hands gently playing with boxes, books, toys, photographs and other things belonging to a collection of works by Fluxus artists at the Walker Art Center. The various low-level noises produced by the hands and the objects generate a quiet, John Cage-style, surround-sound concert.  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    TONY FITZPATRICK: 'THE WONDER: PORTRAITS OF A REMEMBERED CITY,' Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-2144, through Feb. 7. These densely knit concoctions of words and images may be nothing new, but they win you over with their emotion and erudition, both illuminating the greatness of Chicago, as well as their physical solidity. Bristling with an undiluted palette of red, black, white and marigold and dotted with images cut from old matchbook covers as well as poems and personal reminiscences, they conjure up the glamour of bygone hotels, clubs and sports legends while evoking everything from quiltmaking and tattooing to cloisonné and Neo-Expressionism. These works count as highly disciplined exercises in nostalgia: their specificity reveals something new about the time and place they yearn for, as well as the medium they so deftly explore.  ROBERTA SMITH    *'A HEAVENLY CRAFT: THE WOODCUT IN EARLY PRINTED BOOKS,' Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212)838-6690, through Feb. 5. A lively overall view of the development of the woodcut is provided by this show of 15th- and 16th-century books acquired in the mid 1940's by Lessing J. Rosenwald, the Sears Roebuck heir, from the noted C.W. Dyson Perrins collection in England. Ranging from primitive to elegant in style, the books -- in themselves works by master printers -- contain illustrations by artists like Albrecht Durer, Urs Graf and Hans Burgkmair along with lesser names and the more frequent anonymities of the period. Among them are three rare editions of Aesop's fables; the ''Revelationes'' of St. Birgitta, produced in 1500 by the Nuremberg printer Anton Koberger and possibly illustrated by Durer himself, and the 1495 Florence folio edition, one of two in existence, of ''Epistolae et Evangeli,'' a book of Gospels and lessons of the Mass that is one of the greatest Florentine illustrated books of the period.  GLUECK    *EVAN SCHWARTZ, Schroeder Romero, 173A North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-8992, through Feb. 14. ''Reclaiming Puberty,'' Evan Schwartz's New York solo debut, is a document through photographs of a transition from one gender to another. Arranged chronologically, the series starts with family snapshots of the artist as a pre-adolescent girl dressed in a oversized man's tweed jacket and as a sultry teenager in a floor-length gown on her way to a high school prom. Then the pictures change fast as Mr. Evans physically begins to assume a male identity, through a regiment of horomone treatments and a double mastectomy. Celebratory in spirit, the show ends with a second prom photo. In this one, Mr. Schwartz, handsome in a tux, has his arms around a young woman, his date.  COTTER    PINAR YOLACAN: 'PERISHABLES,' Rivington Arms, 102 Rivington Street, between Essex and Ludlow Streets, (646)654-3213, through Feb. 6. Ms. Yolacan's provocatively discomfiting large photographs portray elderly women in carefully tailored off-white blouses, sweaters or scarves made wholly or partly of raw animal flesh -- tripe and chicken skin, mainly -- purchased from butchers. You can read her pictures as unusually visceral feminist poems about fashion and mortality.  JOHNSON    Last Chance    ROZ CHAST: 'SEASON'S GREETINGS,' Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)627-2410, closing tomorrow. For her first New York gallery exhibition, this brilliant cartoonist presents recent cartoons, many of which have appeared in The New Yorker, and a set of eggs brightly painted according to a traditional Ukrainian craft. The eggs bearing images of funny-looking people are amusing, but they don't compete with the cartoons' hilarious and uncannily acute take on the conflicted psychic life of ordinary, white, liberal Americans.  JOHNSON    JAMES GILLRAY, New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212)869-8089, through tomorrow. One of the most popular cartoonists of his day, Gillray (1756-1815) produced lively, hand-colored etchings that lampooned major public figures like the king, the queen and Napoleon, and many minor ones, too. At his best, Gillray's draftsmanly skill and visionary imagination puts him in a league with artists like William Blake, James Ensor and R. Crumb. Hours: Today and tomorrow, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: Free.  KEN JOHNSON    KEITH HARING, Alona Kagan, 540 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)560-0670, closing tomorrow. If you liked the New Museum's lively survey of the East Village scene of the 1980's, you will appreciate this selection of paintings and sculptures by one of the best artists to emerge from that cauldron of antic creativity. It includes subway drawings in chalk on black paper; large, dizzyingly patterned canvases and brightly enameled, cut-metal characters. Barking dogs, radiant babies, flying saucers, mythic monsters and all kinds of hyperactive humans animate Haring's delirious cosmic comedy.

Broadway    +'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories. from traffic cones into megaphones to garbage bags into evening gowns. But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.","excerpt":"Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $96.25.  BEN BRANTLEY    +'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' This alternately pallid and garish revival of the 1983 musical, with songs by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein, comes to life only when its cross-dressing chorus line takes over. This story of a gay couple who run a nightclub in St. Tropez has two bright stars in Daniel Davis (as the manly part of the couple) and the wonderful but slightly miscast Gary Beach (as the womanly one). But Jerry Zaks's production often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include canned corn and packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers. Each one emerges as a saucy individual, and as a team they have been choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with a feisty sense of humor and an athletic verve that should make Arnold Schwarzenegger think twice about using ''girly men'' as a pejorative term (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $100.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly a half-century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by an Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of theater and television fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.  BRANTLEY    *+'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice it, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.  BRANTLEY    +'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience to prick up its ears. Heard not so long ago issuing from the plus-size form of Edna Turnblad in the musical ''Hairspray,'' Mr. Fierstein's voice is one of the most distinctive in theater, variously evoking a kazoo, a congested saxophone, wind in a bottle and echoes from a crypt. It is, in a way, its own multicolored show. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to David Leveaux's abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $100.  BRANTLEY    +'LITTLE WOMEN' Sutton Foster never merely walks when she can scamper in this perky, sketchy adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of a Civil War-era New England girlhood. Portraying Jo the tomboy, Ms. Foster creates a dizzyingly hyperkinetic creature who, were she living in the 21st century, would probably be on Ritalin. Ms. Foster (a Tony winner for \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\") shows a gift for fresh comic line readings. But her energy is often less infectious than exhausting. The same can be said of of the show, directed by Susan H. Schulman and featuring a book by Allan Knee, with songs by Jason Howland and Mindi Dickstein. Watching the production is rather like speedreading Alcott's novel. And the cast members, who include the mellow-voiced Maureen McGovern, mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of the American Girl series of dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $100.  BRANTLEY    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and longtime Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house on Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, and featuring some funny riffs on familiar archetypes, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.  BRANTLEY    ++'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, who all manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    'FAT PIG' Neil LaBute's latest work is on one level yet another demonstration that men are paragons of bad faith and cowardice, a judgmental tradition that this writer established with his screenplay for ''In the Company of Men.'' Yet ''Fat Pig,'' directed by Jo Bonney, is also the most emotionally engaging and unsettling of Mr. LaBute's plays since ''Bash'' five years ago. A show that might have been merely a point-proving exercise is immeasurably enriched by Mr. LaBute's empathy and by the skill and honesty of Jeremey Piven (of ''The Entourage'' on HBO) as a charming rising executive, and and Ashlie Atkinson, the overweight woman he falls for. Andrew McCarthy and Keri Russell (late of ''Felicity'') round out the taut ensemble (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Gerard Alessandrini, the writer and creator of the 22-year-old ''Forbidden Broadway'' series of satirical revues, would seem to be as steamed-up and homicidal as Dirty Harry in a den of crooked cops. This means he is in particularly good form. The New York theater's favorite practitioner of tough love has put on the brass knuckles for this round. The production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars (Patti LuPone, Hugh Jackman). But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as Mr. Alessandrini's lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). Douglas Fairbanks Theater, 432 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8:15 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $49.50 to $57.  BRANTLEY    *'THE GODS ARE POUNDING MY HEAD! (AKA LUMBERJACK MESSIAH)' Even lumberjacks get the cosmic blues in the world of Richard Foreman, the Florenz Ziegfeld of avant-garde drama. In many ways, this show is a typical Foreman extravaganza: tightly orchestrated hallucinogenic visual effects, bruising slapstick and cryptic, fragmented dialogue. But there is also a newly wistful, elegiac note here. ''Gods,'' which features Jay Smith and T. Ryder Smith as a pair of weary woodsmen, is as majestically mad and funny as any Foreman spectacle. But it also has a sadness appropriate to what appears to be a farewell note of sorts, since Mr. Foreman has said he is giving up the kind of plays he has been creating since 1968 to focus on film (1:10). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, (212)533-4650. Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m. Tickets: weekdays $20, $15 for students; $25 for Saturday performances.  BRANTLEY    *'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That would appear to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in the New Group's smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. For these pharmaceutically fried losers in the Hollywood Hills, drugs and alcohol are way beyond recreational status. They're what generate love and hate, security and anxiety, often in such a blurred succession of responses that it's hard to distinguish among them. But thanks to a terrific, uncompromising cast -- directed by Scott Elliott and led by Ethan Hawke, Josh Hamilton and Parker Posey -- theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters on stage would kill for (3:15). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    ++'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it is about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction There are circumcision jokes aplenty, of course, and the requisite zingers about controlling Jewish mothers. and their daughters who don't put out. Several bits are funny despite the familiarity, as when a mother unleashes a volley of questions at her prospective son-in-law with the speed and accuracy of an ace machine-gunner. Later, a woman's status as an imposter is revealed when it's recalled that she paid retail for the Chanel bag. So it goes for two hours. Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    *+'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naive, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country. Bush foes expecting a polemical broadside will be disappointed. Ms. Raffo drew on more than 10 years of interviews to assemble her theatrical mosaic, and the commendable results reveal that she is a journalist, not a purveyor of propaganda. There is plenty here to fuel outrage at the suffering of Iraqi citizens directly caused by American bombing. But Ms. Raffo's women also bear witness to the monstrousnessof Saddam Hussein's regime, with more than one of the play's characters fiercely avowing that no price is too high to pay for ridding the country of his brutality (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the show.  ISHERWOOD    'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Arliss Howard and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination (1:05). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.  BRANTLEY    +'UNDER THE BRIDGE' Kathie Lee Gifford, best known for purveying chitchat on morning television, has re-emerged in showbiz behind the scenes, as the author of a new musical aimed at family audiences. ''Under the Bridge,'' with book and lyrics by Ms. Gifford and music by David Pomeranz, tells the heartwarming story of a spunky group of homeless children who befriend a cranky but lovable old bum. As his hard heart is softened, the urchins and their widowed mother find the home they've long dreamed of. A new family is born. All this in Paris, yet. As that precis suggests, in adapting a popular children's book by Natalie Savage Carlson, Ms. Gifford does not exactly strive tirelessly to avoid the clichéd. The score is competent if generic. Mr. Pomeranz's melodies are pleasant and neatly tailored, while Ms. Gifford's lyrics are doggedly rhymed if rarely graceful. Despite energetic performances all around (special kudos to the likable Ed Dixon as the hobo), Eric Schaeffer's production feels inert (2:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30; Saturdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sundays at 1 and 6 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    Last Chance    +'GEM OF THE OCEAN' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays chronicling the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is more than 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.

'ALIENS OF THE DEEP' Directed by James Cameron and Steven Quale. (G, 48 minutes). When the director James Cameron proclaimed himself ''king of the world'' on winning the Oscar for ''Titanic,'' who knew that he also had designs on the rest of the solar system? His newest film, ''Aliens of the Deep,'' is a grandiose hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy that begins on our planet's ocean floor and ends many miles under the ice crust that covers Europa, the second moon of Jupiter. The movie's sneaky transition from undersea documentary to speculative fantasy of a journey yet to be undertaken is so seamless, you could easily mistake the last portion of the film as the record of an actual space voyage. Mr. Cameron's theory, supported by astrobiologists, is that the life forms found at the deepest levels of the ocean where no light from the sun penetrates may hold clues to the nature of possible life in outer space. Filmed in Imax-3D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone, the two times in his life when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, which preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'BEYOND THE SEA' Starring Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Directed by Mr. Spacey (PG-13, 118 minutes). The matching of two slithery chameleons, the singer Bobby Darin (who died in 1973 at the age of 37) and his latter-day doppelgänger, Mr. Spacey (now 45), sparks a weird bluish flame that suggests a wax yule log posing as wood in the season's teeming fireplace of movie biographies. When ignited, it releases acrid, waxy fumes that feel queasily chemical. The movie, which the star directed and helped write and in which he sings (wonderfully), smacks of the same kind of obsession that brought Bob Fosse's ''All That Jazz'' to creepy reptilian life. Its vision of show business in the 50's and 60's is as tawdry as Fosse's and as incisive in suggesting it's a grubby rags-to-riches circus. (Ms. Bosworth plays Sandra Dee, the bimbo movie princess Darin strenuously wooed and married.) The movie also touches on the ugly reality of show business mothers who force their children to act out their dreams and line their pocketbooks.  HOLDEN    'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play yet exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The formal trickiness of the narrative strips the characters of any daily context that would give their emotions meaning, and the movie is a succession of scenes, some quite powerful on their own, that don't really add up to much. The actors work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen -- raw, brash and witty -- succeeds.  A.O.SCOTT    'COACH CARTER' Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown, Robert Ri'chard, Rick Gonzalez, Nana Gbewonyo and Antwon Tanner. Directed by Thomas Carter (PG-13, 137 minutes). In this solid, unsurprising inspirational-coach drama, Mr. Jackson plays Ken Carter, who returns to his old high school in the tough Northern California city of Richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners, both on and off the court. Based on a true story, the movie combines sports-picture suspense with heroic-educator uplift when Carter, dismayed that his players are slipping academically, padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season. Mr. Carter (the director, no relation to the coach) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism, which are bolstered by the hip-hop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members, especially Mr. Brown, as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities, Ashanti as his girlfriend, and Mr. Gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime.  SCOTT    'ELEKTRA' Starring Jennifer Garner, Terence Stamp, Kirsten Prout, Goran Visnjic, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Will Yun Lee. Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 96 minutes). The latest Hollywood movie to give comic books a bad name, ''Elektra'' stars Ms. Garner as a superheroine who dons fetishwear the color of blood before laying waste to every man in sight. ''Your parents must have had a sense of humor,'' the broodingly handsome and plucky love interest says to Elektra about her mythopoetic name. She answers in the negative: no, they did not, and neither does she. This chick may have a complex (or two), but like the rickety vehicle supporting her and the hopes of Marvel Comics, she emphatically does not have a sense of humor. What she emphatically does have -- and this is of course the entire point of ''Elektra'' -- is a hot bod and a costume that looks as if it was designed by someone very familiar with the Victoria's Secret catalog.  DARGIS    'FAT ALBERT' Starring Kenan Thompson and Kyla Pratt. Directed by Joel Zwick (PG, 93 minutes). One of the truisms of contemporary pop culture is that just when you think it couldn't get any worse, its purveyors any more shameless, you are proved decisively wrong. Based on Bill Cosby's corpulent charmer and his band of brothers, the ''Fat Albert'' movie opens just days after the release of the DVD compilations of the original show. DVD's for the program are featured so prominently in the movie, and the movie feels so much like an extended-play sitcom, I half expected Mr. Cosby to pop up on screen to sell me the discs along with a Coke. From 1972 through 1984, the animated television series ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' enjoyed enormous success. The cartoon was austere but eminently watchable and featured one of those sitcom tunes that etch a permanent groove in your head. Just as memorable was Mr. Cosby's basso-profundo delivery of Fat Albert's trademark ''hey, hey, hey,'' a mantra that signaled that no matter what happened, all would be right in the end. In ''Fat Albert,'' that trademark is resurrected to depressingly diminished ends.  DARGIS    *'HEAD-ON' Starring Birol Unel, Sibel Kekilli, Catrin Striebeck and Guven Kirac. Directed by Fatih Akin (Not rated, 118 minutes). In German and Turkish, with English subtitles. Love doesn't just hurt in the jagged German romance ''Head-On''; it cuts and bleeds and even kills. A story about a lonely man and a still-lonelier woman fighting against their worlds and what often seems like their own best interests, the film has caused a stir in Germany for the murky, troubling light it sheds on the lives of the country's Turkish immigrants. Its popularity made it a fleeting social phenomenon and a minor cultural footnote. But it doesn't explain why this film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of this very young year. One of the truisms about romances, even those shaded pitch black and set to banging rock music, is that you have to fall in love with the characters when they're falling for each other. It takes a long time for Cahit (Birol Unel) and Sibel (Sibel Kekilli) to get inside each other's heads, much less anywhere else, but it doesn't take us long to care about these two perfectly imperfect beings.  DARGIS    'HIDE AND SEEK' Starring Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, Famke Janssen, Elisabeth Shue, Amy Irving, Dylan Baker and Melissa Leo. Directed by John Polson. (R, 105 minutes). In the downbeat, sufficiently unsettling ''Hide and Seek,'' Mr. De Niro plays a New York City shrink, David, who's married to a somnolent type (Ms. Irving) whose love for their daughter, Emily (Ms. Fanning), can't disguise her unhappiness. Soon after the story starts, violence descends on the Callaway family, and David and Emily move to the country for some healing. Once there, things go from lousy to worse as Emily starts staring blankly into the surrounding woods and palling around with a sinister invisible friend called Charlie. Blood drips into the story; then, it pours. One of the most gifted child actors around, Ms. Fanning has both chops and a preternaturally intense screen presence; even when you don't believe the setup, you buy what she is selling. That's a good thing when it comes to this horror-thriller hybrid, which was written by Ari Schlossberg and needs all the help it can get from its actors.  DARGIS    'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller, based on fact, performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered into the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed in ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a hundred-day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.  HOLDEN    'IN GOOD COMPANY' Starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (PG-13, 106 minutes). This gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture, a site of our leading blood sport. Mostly, though, the movie is about men. The two men at the story's engaging center are Carter Duryea (Mr. Grace), a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of Sports America. The man whom Carter is meant to make redundant is the 51-year-old Dan Foreman, a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone. Dan has a picture-perfect family and is the kind of unabashedly old-fashioned masculine type Mr. Quaid has been slow-cooking to perfection over the years and which, on American screens at least, has lately gone missing.  DARGIS    'LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS' Starring Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman. Directed by Brad Silberling (PG, 108 minutes). Since the publication of the first installment in Lemony Snicket's (aka Daniel Handler's) charmingly malignant book cycle ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult to another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune. But now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature: their story has been turned into a major Hollywood movie -- and with Jim Carrey, no less.  DARGIS    'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and new species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Acquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations. The pleasures of this movie are like those of a beautifully illustrated, haphazardly plotted picture book, which precocious children (and nostalgic adults) can linger over, feeding their own reveries and fantasies.  SCOTT    'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr. Wilson).  DARGIS    'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent intepretation from Mr. Radford and from a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that in evoking Velázquez, Rembrandt, Titian and Vermeer, immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.  SCOTT    'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio this year.  SCOTT    'MONSIEUR N' Starring Philippe Torreton, Richard E. Grant, Jay Rodan and Elsa Zylberstein. Directed by Antoine de Caunes (Not rated, 127 minutes). In French, with English subtitles. This densely plotted costume drama, which flashes back from the exhumation of Napoleon Bonaparte's body in 1840 Paris to the years leading up to his death in 1921 on the remote island of St. Helena, imagines that his official death might have been an elaborate hoax. The screenplay is peppered with Napoleon's epigrammatic zingers, which reveal him as the smartest person in the room. Mr. Torreton's glowering emperor exerts a magnetic if slightly repellent spell. Mr. Grant, as Hudson Lowe, the British governor in charge of the island, is almost as fine in the role of a raging control freak whose behavior is more stereotypically Napoleonic than Napoleon's. If the movie amounts to little more than a historical divertissement, it is well done.  HOLDEN    'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Julia Roberts, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in this enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick, a trio of crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues, and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean, played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which, given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction, is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box-office entertainment ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again, Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack; Mr. Pitt plays his second in command, Rusty Ryan; and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs.  DARGIS    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Starring Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver. Directed by Joel Schumacher (PG-13, 143 minutes). ''Far too many notes for my taste,'' a minor character remarks, apropos of the threatening letters being sent by the micro-managing phantom. That pretty much sums up the problems with Andrew Lloyd Webber's bombastic score, the pretentious clutter of which is well matched by Mr. Schumacher's production. For all the invocations of ''the angel of music,'' this film, adapted from the curiously popular stage musical, will most likely leave you with a devilish headache. The songs are unlistenable, which also makes them hard to sing, but Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler show some impressive vocal technique, and Ms. Rossum, in addition to being lovely, has enough movie star luminosity to avoid being buried in the busy sets and elaborate costumes. This 2-hour-20-minute barrage may drive you back to the 1925 version of ''Phantom,'' which starred Lon Chaney and which has many virtues. For one thing, it is short. For another, it's silent.  SCOTT    'SPANGLISH' Starring Adam Sandler, Téa Leoni and Paz Vega. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Brooks, one of the smartest and sunniest men in Hollywood, turns his attention to class division, cultural misunderstanding and marital discord in Los Angeles -- all subjects ripe for the kind of warm-hearted comedy in which he specializes and all of them treated with astonishing smugness and dishonesty. Mr. Sandler plays John Clasky, a successful chef who almost falls for his maid, Flor (Ms. Vega), a situation that Mr. Brooks rescues from sleaziness by making Jack's wife, Deborah (Ms. Leoni), a thoroughgoing monster: irredeemably selfish, vain and ridiculous. Deborah, a bad mother and a useless wife, serves as the film's scapegoat, and her demonization contrasts with the idealization of Flor in a way that manages to be both overtly misogynist and implicitly racist. Mr. Sandler smiles through it all, playing a nice guy who unwittingly personifies the film's self-adoring liberal bad faith.  SCOTT    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, and directed by the cult favorite Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amelie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.  DARGIS    'WHITE NOISE' Starring Michael Keaton, Chandra West and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by Geoffrey Sax (PG-13, 101 minutes). A laugh-laced cheap thrill that has nothing to do with the Don DeLillo novel of the same title, ''White Noise'' was directed by Mr. Sax, whose résumé hopefully notes that this would-be auteur comes from a long and venerable line of BBC-trained directors. It is a long and venerable line that, on the evidence of his feature filmmaking debut, Mr. Sax may bring to an unintended end. It's impossible to say exactly who takes the brunt of the blame here, although the screenwriting credit belongs to Niall Johnson. Mr. Johnson apparently wrote ''White Noise'' in 2002, several years after the Japanese horror movie ''Ringu'' helped trigger the recent fad for Asian horror, and his script hinges on the premise that there are ghosts in the machine anxious to reach out and touch us. Often, the person on this side of the death divide is a spunky woman or a high school girl in a miniskirt and knee socks, but here the hero reaching across time, space and genre is played by Mr. Keaton.  DARGIS    'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.  SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    *ANTIBALAS, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236. Antibalas delivers a New York makeover to Fela Kuti's Afrobeat, the Nigerian funk propelled by burly saxophones, fierce percussion and righteous anger. Performing constantly around New York has given the band a combined tightness and relaxation, the assurance that they can sustain and expand a groove until everyone is dancing. Tonight at 9; admission is $15.  JON PARELES    BONGA'S VODOU, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155. Bonga Jean-Baptiste leads a drum-and-dance ensemble playing voodoo rhythms from Haiti. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is $15.  PARELES    *BUCKWHEAT ZYDECO/MARCIA BALL, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Stanley (Buckwheat) Dural Jr. is a zydeco accordionist that rockers can love. He bolsters the hefty sound of his accordion with a horn section, and his sets include plenty of gutsy blues tunes along with Cajun two-steps and waltzes. The band is an indefatigable party generator. Marcia Ball plays two-fisted New Orleans barrelhouse piano and sings in a husky, good-natured voice. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; admission is $25.50.  PARELES    DAMIEN CONNOLLY AND FRIENDS, Glucksman Ireland House, 1 Washington Mews (Fifth Avenue above Washington Square), (212)998-3950. Irish traditional music by Damien Connolly, who took up his family's musical heritage by learning both his father's instrument, the button accordion, and his uncle's, the fiddle. He also plays an old-style, one-row accordion, the melodeon. He will be accompanied by his wife, Sally Connolly, on flute along with Matt Mancuso on fiddle, Pete Mancuso on guitar and Annmarie Acosta on piano. Tonight at 9; tickets are $15.  PARELES    *JOHNNY CUNNINGHAM TRIBUTE, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824 or (212)545-7536. The Scottish fiddler Johnny Cunningham was a great raconteur and an even better Celtic fiddler, and his death in December 2003 was a loss to traditional music. He helped spark a Scottish music revival in the 1970's as a member of Silly Wizard and went on to a career of performing, producing and composing. His friends and musical collaborators have organized a tribute that's likely to present some of the most heartfelt Celtic music of the year. To play some of Mr. Cunningham's music, including tunes from his Obie-winning score for \\"Peter and Wendy,\\" the group includes Phil Cunningham, Johnny's brother and frequent musical partner, on accordion; the forthright Irish singer Susan McKeown; the fiddler Kevin Burke, one of Mr. Cunningham's very few peers; Seamus Egan, who plays flute, tenor banjo and mandolin and also happens to be one of the writers of the Sarah McLachlan hit \\"I Will Remember You,\\" and Aidan Brennan on guitar. Guests are likely to show up as well. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $30 and $35, $15 for students.  PARELES    DR. JOHN, Community Theater, 100 South Street, Morristown, N.J., (973)539-8008. Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and his florid piano playing not just to New Orleans funk and rhythm-and-blues but to Ellington, standards and songs with a conscience, though his latest album circles back to some New Orleans classics. Tonight at 8; tickets are $37 to $47.  PARELES    JOLIE HOLLAND, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. On her album \\"Escondida\\" (Anti), Jolie Holland savors anachronisms in largely acoustic songs that mix swing, gospel, blues, Appalachian ballads and other Americana. The settings are folky, but the tidings are often dark: \\"Big stars fall down twinkling as they fall,\\" she warns. Tomorrow night at 10:45, with Akron/Family at 9:30 and Sean Hayes at 8:30; tickets are $12 in advance, $14 tomorrow.  PARELES    LHASA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155. Lhasa had a childhood worthy of a NAFTA citation, growing up in upstate New York, Mexico and Montreal. On her album \\"The Living Road\\" (Nettwerk America), her lean, mostly acoustic arrangments dip into anything from Mexican waltzes to guitar feedback. She sings in Spanish, French and English, with a husky, torchy voice that fills her music with the smoldering drama of Mexican boleros and French chansons. Tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday night at 9:30; tickets are $20 in advance, $25 at the door.  PARELES    USTAD ABDUL WAHID KHAN SAHIB TRIBUTE, Mela Foundation Dream House, 275 Church Street, 3rd floor, between Franklin and White Streets, TriBeCa, (212) 925-8270. La Monte Young, the fountainhead of Minimalist composing, was a disciple of the Indian singer Pandit Pran Nath. This is a tribute to his guru's guru, Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan Sahib, a virtuoso who sang primarily for holy men and at Sufi saints' tombs. The concert will feature evening ragas including Mr. Young's \\"Raga Sundara,\\" sung by Mr. Young, his wife Marian Zazeela and the Just Alap ensemble. The alap is the meditative, improvisational prelude that begins every classical raga; \\"just\\" refers to just intonation, the tuning system based on exact mathematical ratios rather than the compromises necessary for keyboards. Tomorrow night at 9; admission is $24, $18 for students and members of the Mela Foundation.  PARELES    LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO QUEEN: NO TIME FOR LOSERS, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Joe McGinty and his coterie of songwriting connoisseurs apply themselves to the mixture of hard-rock grandiosity and campy arrogance that was Queen. Doubtless they'll figure out some ingenious ways to reinterpret the multitracked splendors of songs like \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; admission is $20 tonight, $25 tomorrow.  PARELES    *M.I.A., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. This Sri Lanka-raised, London-based rapper made an explosive debut with a pair of devastating reggae-influenced singles: \\"Galang\\" and \\"Sunshowers\\" found her riding sharp beats playfully, chanting and declaiming and sometimes even singing alongside her propulsive computer-generated tracks. (Visit www.miauk.com to hear for yourself.) Her debut album, \\"Arular\\" (XL), isn't scheduled to be released until Feb. 22, but this should be a wildly exciting party for a club full of revelers who already consider her a star. Tomorrow night at 10:30, with Diplo (M.I.A.'s D.J., who's also half of the great Philadelphia D.J. duo Hollertronix) and Catchdubs, both of whom are to stick around after M.I.A. for a free after-party; tickets are $12.  KELEFA SANNEH    DAVID MORALES, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. Mr. Morales, a house-music veteran, has made his name as a D.J., a producer and -- above all -- a remixer. For one example of what he does, search out his 11-minute \\"Def Mix\\" version of Mariah Carey's \\"Dreamlover,\\" included on Ms. Carey's compilation, \\"The Remixes\\" (Columbia); after a long percussion break, he isolates and repeats a few of her ultra-falsetto ad-libs to create a sublime, spooky study in vocal texture. Tomorrow night after 10; tickets are $25 in advance, more at the door.  SANNEH    THE O'JAYS, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)749-5838 or (212)864-0372. The O'Jays were the flagship group of the Philadelphia soul producers Gamble and Huff, dealing with hard times in songs like \\"Backstabbers\\" and \\"For the Love of Money\\" and hoping for better ones with \\"Love Train.\\" Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $45 to $65.  PARELES    *RAINER MARIA, Northsix, 66 North 6th Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. Everything is in flux in the music of Rainer Maria. From verse to verse, its songs sound like hurtling punk or grand arena-rock or pensive folk-rock. But amid the musical shifts and ambivalent lyrics, the music is full of muscle and conviction. Tomorrow night at 9, with Tristeza, Dropsonic and Tungsten 74 opening; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 tomorrow.  PARELES    THE RED PARTY, Spirit, 530 W. 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)268-9477. Junior Vasquez, a veteran D.J., comes to Spirit to throw this annual party, which is likely to attract a mainlymale crowd. Expect to hear the usual digitized disco and euphoric synthesizer lines, but don't be surprised if, at some point during his scheduled 10-hour set, Junior Vasquez also finds time to play thicker and darker rhythmic tracks; he knows the crowd will follow him wherever he roams. Tonight, well after 10; tickets are $20 in advance, $30 at the door.  SANNEH    THE ROGERS SISTERS, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. This proud trio excavates the sharp, twitchy post-punk of yesteryear, emphasizing not only the music's severity but its occasional playfulness, too. The Rogers Sisters' recent mini-album, \\"Three Fingers\\" (Troubleman Unlimited), nods to the sing-song choruses of the Delta 5 and even the sardonic pop of Devo. Tonight at 9, with the Flesh and Thunderbirds Are Now!; tickets are $10.  SANNEH    *SASHA, JAMES LAVELLE, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000. Sasha, the wildly popular progressive-house D.J., has a knack for pleasing huge crowds without (for the most part) pandering to them. He avoids both the obvious and the unusual, topping his steady, thumping beats with complicated electronic patterns that slowly decay and mutate. He is to be joined by James Lavelle, from the electronica duo Unkle; perhaps Mr. Lavelle will find time to spin the hypnotic \\"Delayed Gratification\\" mix of the Unkle track \\"Reign,\\" which was chopped up and stripped down by Morgan Geist, of Metro Area. Tonight after 10; tickets are $35 in advance, more at the door.  SANNEH    *SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR, Zankel Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, (212) 247-7800 or (212)545-7536. Gospel music and traditional South African harmonies and rhythms have found common ground and hybrid possibilities since Christian missionaries arrived in South Africa in the 19th century. This 32-member choir carries the fusion toward jubilation, performing traditional songs (and \\"Mbube,\\" the Zulu song better known as \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\") alongside gospel messages. They sing in six languages Tonight at 10; tickets are $30 to $42.  PARELES    THIRD WORLD, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston, South Village, (212)243-4940. Third World occupies the pop end of the reggae spectrum, harmonizing on hits like \\"Now That We've Found Love\\" while promising \\"Roots With Quality.\\" Sunday night at 8; admission is $18 in advance, $20 on Sunday.  PARELES    ZEMOG, EL GALLO BUENO, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue between Metropolitan Avenue and North Third Street, , Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934. Zemog, El Gallo Bueno is a Boston band that pushes the hard-driving mambos of salsa toward the squall of Sun Ra's free jazz. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is free.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    RUTH BROWN, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212)308-9455. This rhythm-and-blues legend has weathered one personal disaster after another, but misfortunes that might have silenced a less determined performer have only added dimension to Ms. Brown's already larger-than-life musical personality. Exhibiting a flamboyant showmanship that recalls her peer, James Brown, she proudly presents herself as an indomitable member of royalty and stylistic descendant of the Queen of the Blues herself, Dinah Washington. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30 and Sunday at 8. Cover: $50.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $42 at 8, with a $15 minimum (an $80 dinner-and-show package is available).  HOLDEN    *BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.  HOLDEN    UTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)570-7189. This imperious, Dietrich-like cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through Feb. 26, lends the entire nightclub enterprise a German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum.  HOLDEN    *'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra''' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30; $20 at the bar; $10 minimum.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    *CLAUDIA ACUÑA QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Claudia Acuña, a young jazz singer from Chile, is committed to the idea of a jazz singer as an inseparable part of the band -- or, better yet, as a bandleader. She is working with a great crop of New York musicians, and they play around with mambos, South American jazz and folk music, Middle Eastern scales and improvising that goes far beyond mere accompaniment. In short, they're contemporary. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set, $10 for members.  BEN RATLIFF    JERRY BERGONZI QUARTET, Smith's Bar, 701 Eighth Avenue, at 44th Street, Midtown, (212) 246-3268. Jerry Bergonzi is a post-Coltrane tenor saxophonist of incredible technical facility; he's an inspiration for music students, though he hasn't broken through to reach the ordinary jazz listener on a broad scale. Tonight at 9; there is no cover.  RATLIFF    THE BLUIETT BAND, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626. What a sound Hamiet Bluiett has on the baritone saxophone, and what a ruckus he can kick up when he's stalking a good time. A longtime member of the World Saxophone Quartet, he has been a local favorite since the 1970's; he is still hiring good young musicians and creating converts. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    BRAZILIAN CARNAVAL UNIVERSAL WITH CYRO BAPTISTA AND FRIENDS, Dizzy's Club, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212)258-9595. New York-based, Brazilian-born Cyro Baptista builds loud and mirthful percussion ensembles; he'll be celebrating carnival time in Brazil with his sphere of colleagues from the worlds of Brazilian music and jazz. Sets through Sunday night at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    CHICK COREA AND TOUCHSTONE, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592. Armed with new music, the impressively prolific pianist Mr. Corea re-activates the neo-flamenco/jazz-fusion sound of his early-90's record, ''Touchstone.'' The band includes Jorge Pardo on saxophone and flute, Carles Benavent on bass, Tom Brechtlein on drums and Rubem Dantas on percussion. Sets through Sunday night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $45, and there is a $5 minimum.  RATLIFF    *DAVE DOUGLAS AND NOMAD, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212)255-4037. The first release on Greenleaf, the trumpeter Mr. Douglas's new label, is his new band Nomad, a quintet including tuba and clarinet; the band plays earthy, gregarious jazz chamber music, a cross between the energetic Balkan-tinged improvisation heard in Mr. Douglas's Tiny Bell Trio and the hushed dynamics of another of his bands, Charms of the Night Sky. For its week at the Vanguard, this Nomad has a different lineup than the record's. Besides Mr. Douglas, it includes the saxophonist Myron Ewalden, the cellist Rubin Kodheli, the tubaist the Marcus Rojas and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. Sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    OLIVER LAKE STEEL QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. Oliver Lake, an original member of the World Saxophone Quartet, claims Eric Dolphy as a stylistic father in his acidic tone and in the darting movements of his playing. But his structural mindset has led him all over the place: toward reggae, big-band exercises and steel-drum music, the focus of his Steel Quartet. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30; cover charge is $25.  RATLIFF    *JOE LOVANO STREET BAND, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212) 581-3080. The last time I heard it, this unusual jazz septet was playing themes associated with Enrico Caruso as intimate, casual, nonconcert-hall music, a spontaneous gathering of players piling layers on to the same melody. It may have evolved slightly since two years ago, but at that time it consisted of Mr. Lovano on tenor saxophone, two bassists, one plucking and the other bowing; a singer (Judi Silvano) intoning wordless melodies and improvising; a drummer; an accordionist; and a clarinetist, sitting-cross-legged, who also played percussion on cookie tins, take-out containers and cymbals and frame drums lying flat on the floor. It was brilliant. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $35, and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    MARK MURPHY, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2121. Since the late 1950's, the singer Mr. Murphy has been exploring new ways to distinguish himself from the rest of the jazz singers out there, and though some might wince at his extremism with phrasing and rhythm, he's still working at an impressively high level on all sorts of repertory, from the standard jazz-singer's ballads to newer pop to Dave Frishberg's darkly humorous songs. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10, on Sunday night at 8:45 and 10; cover charge is $30, and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'PELLÉAS ET MÉLISANDE' The dream-like music of Debussy's opera flows extra-gorgeously and extra-heavily from the Metropolitan Opera pit under the baton of James Levine, poising the work somewhere between Wagner and Italian opera; while Jonathan Miller's production lends a touch of Edward Gorey to the whole. What's missing in the singing is Frenchness: Anne Sofie von Otter is a lovely mezzo Mélisande; William Burden, an adequate tenor Pelléas; Roberto Scandiuzzi, a warm and dark yet slightly out of tune Arkel; Felicity Palmer, an elegant Genevieve. The exception is José van Dam's Golaud, sung so that every word is clear and every note is felt. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $145 and $215.  ANNE MIDGETTE    'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' This Puccini favorite continues its run at the Met with fresh singers in the principal roles, including Cynthia Lawrence as Cio-Cio-San, Marco Berti as Pinkerton and Charles Taylor as Sharpless. In his traditional production, Giancarlo del Monaco paints the stage with storybook images of rural Japan. Emmanuel Villaume conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200.  JEREMY EICHLER    TURANDOT The American soprano Andrea Gruber takes on the daunting title role of Puccini's ''Turandot'' in the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Franco Zeffirelli's gargantuan and glittering 1987 production, so popular that it's critic-proof. Ms. Gruber has been singing some formidable repertory since returning to the fold of the Met in 2001, and her enormous voice shows signs of wear and stridency. Still, her singing is fearless and impassioned and through sheer force of will she excels in the role. The tenor Johan Botha is a heroic Calaf; the soprano Krassimira Stoyanova brings affecting vulnerability and throbbing richness to the role of Liu. Bertrand de Billy conducts a colorful and exciting account of Puccini's final opera. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215; returns, if available, are sold before the performance.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. Tonight, in addition to works by Chopin and Liszt, Doris Stevenson will take on Frederic Rzewski's intensely wrought setting of Oscar Wilde's ''De Profundis,'' which requires as much theatrical skill (speaking, shouting, etc.) as it does keyboard dexterity. Tomorrow night and Sunday, the angst turns Schubertian as the baritone Chris Pedro Trakas is joined by the pianist Michael Barrett for ''Die Winterreise.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $25; an additional free concert takes place tomorrow at 1 p.m.  EICHLER    CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA Tonight's third of four concerts by the Cleveland Orchestra at Carnegie Hall this week offers contrasts between contemporary composers: the darkness and melancholy of Harrison Birtwistle's ''Night's Black Bird'' and Henri Dutilleux's light-filled Second Symphony, ''Le Double.'' Radu Lupu will continue his survey of the Beethoven Piano Concertos with the ''Emperor.'' Franz Welser-Möst, the orchestra's young music director, conducts. Tomorrow brings more standard programming: Mr. Lupu with the Beethoven Fourth Concerto, then the Schubert ''Unfinished'' Symphony and Berg's ''Three Pieces for Orchestra.'' Tonight at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $29 to $116.  BERNARD HOLLAND    DVORAK ANNIVERSARY TRIBUTE Do you need proof that the tendency to link performances to anniversaries has gotten out of hand? Here is a chamber program that doesn't really cry out for special justification, but is being offered as a celebration of the 110th anniversary of Dvorak's arrival in New York to teach at the National Conservatory of Music, in New York. As it happens, the performance is taking place at Washington Irving High School, which was built on the site where the National Conservatory was once located. The program includes Dvorak's Sonatine in G for Violin, the Romantic Pieces (Op. 75), and selections from the Biblical Songs (Op. 99), as well as Josef Suk's Song of Love (Op. 7, No. 1) and arrangements of spirituals by Henry T. Burleigh, who introduced Dvorak to this music. The performers are Anna Polonsky, a pianist, Soovin Kim, a violinist and Charles Mays Jr., a baritone. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, (212)586-4680. Tickets: $9.  ALLAN KOZINN    FREIBURG BAROQUE ORCHESTRA Petra Müllejns conducts a program of Bach and Handel with the distinguished German soprano Christine Schäfer as a guest. Ms. Schäfer sings Bach's cantata ''Weichet nur, betrübte Schatten'' and excerpts from Handel's ''Alcina.'' Bach's C-major Orchestral Suite and the Handel Concerto Grosso Op. 3, No. 2 are also on the program. Sunday at at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $56.  HOLLAND    KRONOS QUARTET Premieres are what makes this iconoclastic quartet's engine purr, and tomorrow night it is playing a program's worth of them. Included are the United States premiere of Meredith Monk's ''Stringsongs'' and the New York premieres of Michael Gordon's ''Potassium,'' Tamburi Cemil Bey's ''Evic Taksim,'' Willem Jeths's ''Intus Trepidare'' (''Trembling From Within''), Alexandra Du Bois's ''Oculus pro Oculo Totum Orbem Terrae Caecat'' (''An Eye for an Eye Makes the World Go Blind'') and Felipe Pérez Santiago's ''CampoSanto'' (''Holy Ground''). Tomorrow at 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $30 to $45.  KOZINN    CHRISTINE SCHÄFER In the huge opera houses of the United States, small, intense voices don't come off to best advantage, which may be a reason New York hasn't heard even more of the German soprano Christine Schäfer, who has sung at the Met but appears more regularly in Berlin or Salzburg, as everything from Berg's Lulu to Mozart's Konstanze to Verdi's Violetta. Tonight's recital features a couple of characterizations: Schubert's settings of Mignon's songs from ''Wilhelm Meister'' and Richard Strauss's three Ophelia songs. Also on the program are other Strauss songs and -- a highlight -- Berg's ''Seven Early Songs.'' Ted Taylor is the accompanist. Tonight at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $48.  MIDGETTE    Dance    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event.

JENNIFER DUNNING    *AKIM FUNK BUDDHA The ever-exuberant Mr. Buddha (or is it Funk-Buddha?) specializes in dance-theater that combines unblinking stillness, story-telling, tap and Mongolian throat singing. He adds martial arts, breakdancing, beat-boxing Japanese, Zulu and urban English to the mix in his new ''Amazulu: Dance As a Weapon: The Hip-Hop Circus -- Part I.'' Tonight (and Thursdays through Saturdays through Feb. 19) at 10 p.m.; Sundays (through Feb. 20) at 5:30 p.m. ,La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, west of Second Avenue, Manhattan, (212)475-7710 or www.lamama.org. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    *COOL NEW YORK 2005 DANCE FESTIVAL If past dance marathons at this handsome and inviting little studio theater are a guide, any one performance in this closing weekend, all free, will get you an invigorating mix of the sublime, the professional and the truly terrible, with a couple of great new finds along the way. Tonight at 7 and 9; tomorrow at 2 (family matinee), 7 and 9 p.m.; Sunday at 4 and 6 p.m., White Wave's John Ryan Theater, 25 Jay Street at the Dumbo waterfront, Brooklyn, (718)855-8822 or www.whitewavedance.com (information only; no reservations).  DUNNING    *DANCENOW/NYC'S DANCEMOPOLITAN Dancenow/NYC begins its 2005 season with the first installment of its ''dancemopolitan'' series, with Doug Elkins as host, in a distinctively intimate cabaret setting. The artists include Mary Cochran, Nicholas Duran, Erico Villanueva and a surprise guest (tonight only); Julian Barnett, Nicole Berger, Maura Donohue and Edisa Weeks (tomorrow only), and John Heginbotham, Wendy Osserman, Laura Peterson, ShantiDance and Mary Suk (both nights). Tonight and tomorrow at 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, between East 4th Street and Astor Place, Manhattan, (212)239-6200; (212) 539-8878 for dinner reservations. Tickets: $15 plus $12 minimum food or two-drink charge.  DUNNING    KEELY GARFIELD Ms. Garfield combines a blithe, dark sense of humor and a fascination with knotty emotional issues. In this program of new dances, she examines twins torn asunder and the reckless entrances and tormented exit wounds of love and estrangement. Whew. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, Chelsea, (212)924-0077. Tickets: $25.  DUNNING    HEATHER HARRINGTON DANCE COMPANY The Dance Previews series at the Y presents Ms. Harrington's group in her new ''Devil's Playground,'' in which dancers play games of desire, jealousy and greed on a stage strewn with toys, and excerpts from ''Imitations of Drowning,'' which explores the psyche of Lady Macbeth . Sunday at 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Upper East Side, (212)415-5500. Tickets: $10.  JACK ANDERSON    ELISA MONTE DANCE A choreographer known for physically intense and often sensual choreography offers two premieres. ''A Woman's Way (To Nancy, With Love from Tom),'' an ode to love, shares programs with pieces from the repertory (Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7:30 p.m.). ''Via Sacra'' is a three-act work that concerns the mutability of life and the struggle to work through loss. Ms. Monte's sources of inspiration for it include the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche and the color theories of the artist Josef Albers (Tonight at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m.). Tonight and tomorrow at 8, Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea (212)242-0800. Tickets: $40.  ANDERSON    *NEW YORK CITY BALLET The big news of the weekend is the return to the company repertory of Jerome Robbins's ''Fanfare'' (tonight and tomorrow afternoon), danced to and inspired by Benjamin Britten's Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, a festive piece d'occasion choreographed for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. In addition to learning, at last, how to distinguish the oboe from the harp, balletgoers will get a chance to see several young up-and-comers in new roles. tk, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or www.nycballet.com.Tickets: $30.-$80.  DUNNING    NEXT WAVE: LA LA LA HUMAN STEPS Édouard Lock promises that his new ''Amelia,'' performed to music by David Lang with Velvet Underground lyrics, will feature intense and daring partnering and choreography that sweeps across the stage with the ferocity of a midsummer storm. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn, (718)636-4100. Tickets: $20, $40 and $60.  DUNNING    'NOGUCHI-GRAHAM: SELECTED WORKS FOR DANCE' This glowing, sensitively informed exhibition, which runs through May 1, may surprise and delight even the most knowledgeable admirers of the work of Isamu Noguchi and Martha Graham. The Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road at Vernon Boulevard, Queens, (718)204-7088 or www.noguchi.org. Today (and Wednesday through Fridays) 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+. Tickets are $10 round trip for shuttle bus on Saturdays and Sundays.  DUNNING    LAURA PAWEL DANCE COMPANY Ms. Pawel, a longtime presence on the downtown dance scene, offers the premiere of ''Tangled Yarn,'' which features movement material from older dances reworked from different choreographic perspectives to a score by Eleanor Hovda, one of the choreographer's frequent musical collaborators. Ms. Pawel, who likes to combine improvisational choreographic structures with sound and text, will also be represented by ''Phoenix,'' ''Pedestrian Zone'' and ''Conversation.'' Tonight and tomorrow at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Dance Forum, 20 East 17th Street, Union Square, (212)633-7202. Tickets: $15.  ANDERSON    'I LOVE TANGO' This ''tango musical'' boasts four dancers, live string music from Quinteto Sinopus of Uruguay and music from the bandoneon player Raul Jaurena, the singer Marga Mitchell and the pianist Octavio Luis Brunetti. Tonight (and Thursdays and Fridays through March 25) at 8 p.m.; tomorrow (and Saturdays through March 26) at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays (through March 27) at 4 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 729-3880 or www.thaliatheatre.org. Tickets: $30; $27 for students and 65+; $25 (Thursdays).  DUNNING    THUNDERBIRD AMERICAN INDIAN DANCERS Dances of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Inuit, Hopi and Pueblo peoples will be included in this 30th annual Pow-Wow, along with a new modern-dance piece by Tom Pearson, a Creek Cherokee. Performers include the Heyna Second Song Singers and Mitoka Eagle. Tonight and tomorrow (and next Friday and Saturday) at 8 p.m.; Sunday (and next Sunday) at 2 and 5 p.m. Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue at Tenth Street, Manhattan, (212)254-1109. Tickets: $10; $1 for children under 12 accompanying ticket-bearing adults on Sunday.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphosing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  HOLLAND COTTER    *'FROM FILIPPO LIPPI TO PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA: FRA CARNEVALE AND THE MAKING OF A RENAISSANCE MASTER,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 1. The Italian Renaissance artist-priest known as Fra Carnevale was an art-world somebody in his day, but a shadowy figure to modern historians, known primarily for two extraordinary paintings of tiny figures in fantastic architectural settings. Both paintings are in this intricate think-piece of a show that tries to reconstruct his career by bringing his known paintings together. At the same time, it uses his work, along with that of major figures like Filippo Lippi and Piero della Francesca, to explore larger ideas about self-created professional identity in a cultural epoch far more diverse than it is sometimes thought to be. A few of the paintings mustered as evidence are pretty strange; many are glorious. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65+, $10; students, $7.  COTTER    'IMAGES OF DON QUIXOTE: THE ART OF ILLUSTRATION AND PRINTMAKING,' the Hispanic Society of America, 613 West 155th Street, (212)926-2234, through Feb. 20. A few years back, a poll of international writers voted ''Don Quixote'' the greatest book of all time. This year Cervantes's novel is four centuries old, and the Hispanic Society is celebrating the occasion with this exhibition of illustrations of the story printed from the 17th through 20th centuries. Despite its small size, the show demonstrates how attitudes toward the book changed in different eras, from raucous comedy to Romantic tragedy. And in designs by artists like Fragonard and Gustave Dore, there are fascinating images and ideas to consider. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 4 p.m. Free.  COTTER    'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718)638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was one of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  KEN JOHNSON    'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. But whether or not you dig the notion of ''faunal apparel,'' as its organizers refer to outside skins, the show has this to impart: from the moment you encounter the entryway exhibit, a Ziegfeldesque mannequin on a trapeze swing dramatically enveloped by a Roberto Cavalli cascade of pink ostrich feathers, to the outrageous Stephen Jones hat adorned with a crocodile head in the last case, you are on message that fashion is theater, and sometimes theater of the absurd. Hours and admission: see above.  GRACE GLUECK    Galleries: Uptown    RODNEY MCMILLIAN, Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, (212)865-0783, through Feb. 13. Based in Los Angeles, Mr. McMillian studied with the conceptual artist Charles Gaines, and like his mentor, he fuses appropriated images and objects with enigmatic touching on science, sociology and contemporary art history. At the center of the spare exhibition is an installation of mattresses and box springs that the artist collected on streets of New York City and arranged in five sequential stacks of increasing height. Most of the beds are in decent shape, still covered with brightly patterned fabric, but some are some badly stained, battered and torn. Piled up, they're like geological strata: urban life as seen through the furniture of sleep, sex and death, an entropic image that Robert Smithson would have appreciated.  COTTER    *'UNICA ZÜRN: DRAWINGS FROM THE 1960S,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212)753-4444, through April 16. The German artist and writer Unica Zürn (1916-1970) was a lover of Hans Bellmer, through whom she met many mebers of the Surrealist circle in Paris. Despite repeated confinements to psychiatric hospitals, she wrote books of poetry, fiction and autobiography, and during a brief period in the 1960's produced drawings, a cross between elaborate doodles and minutely controlled images of fantastic beings: half figurative, half abstract; human and bestial; composed of webs of delicate pen strokes. Like run-on dreams, they are as varied in detail and crushingly similar in tone. In 1970, with an aubiographical novel, ''Dark Spring,'' completed, she left a clinic to return to Bellmer, who ended the relationship. Having nowhere to go, Zürn jumped from the window of his apartment to her death.  COTTER    Galleries: SoHo    *'LOG CABIN,' Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212)226-3970, through Feb. 26. Given the cultural climate, wedding bells won't be playing ''Over the Rainbow'' any time soon, and men and women won't be coming out of the closet and going in the Army. So what can Log Cabin Republicans, gay supporters of the ruling party, be thinking? This is one of the questions posed, however indirectly, by the 33 participants in a snappy, discursive group show that serves as a field report on what art with queer identity as a theme is looking like these days. As surveyed by the curator, Jeffrey Uslip, it's looking good and heterogeneous: ambisexual, interracial and multi-generational, though short on lesbian artists, who are making some of the best work anywhere.  COTTER    Galleries: Chelsea    JULIAN STANCZAK: 'CONSTELLATIONS AND COLORS: FOUR DECADES OF PAINTING,' Stefan Stux Gallery, 530 West 25th Street, (212)352-1600, through Feb. 19. One of the Op artists in the Museum of Modern Art's famous ''Responsive Eye'' exhibition of 1965, Mr. Stanczak has not strayed from the fold in the 40 years since. Along the way, his work has steadily become more refined and ingenious. In this display of 10 works going back to the 1970's, the centerpiece is ''Niania's Multiples'' (2003-04), a wall work of 36 square modules. A softly defined square of glowing hue that sometimes generates an X shape sits at the center of each module, its radiance spreading out to create a kind of color harmonics. The more you look, the more affecting the work becomes overall. Other carefully conceived works offer other perceptual delights. Who says Op art is dead?  GLUECK    'URBAN LEGENDS,' Artek Contemporaries, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 312, (212)463-8500, through Feb. 15. The three artists in this small show all take the city, whether gritty or abstract, as a theme. In paintings of bent grids, Mike Childs offers what look like closeups of glass-and-steel high rises, and Joseduardo Granados displays finely drawn, intense crosses between landscapes and cityscapes. Mark Chamberlain claims the Gotham of ''Batman'' fame as his turf and explores the hitherto closeted relationship between the masked hero and his younger sidekick and longtime companion, Robin.  COTTER    Other Galleries    *'MAPPING SITTING: ON PORTRAITURE AND PHOTOGRAPHY,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212)998-6780, through April 2. The commercial photographs in this show -- passport head-shots, formal group portraits of police academy graduates, casual pictures of guys showing off on the beach -- are among some 150,000 from Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Morocco, Palestine and Syria in the collection of the Arab Image Foundation, a research archive and cultural salvage operation established in Beirut in 1997 to gather and preserve photography from the Arab World. The selection at Grey Gallery suggests how photographs have been used and valued in Middle Eastern cultures, and it replaces Western stereotypes of bearded gunmen, black-shrouded women with a sense of the complicated ordinariness that is the reality of modern Arab life as it is of modern American life.  COTTER    *EVAN SCHWARTZ AND MICHAEL WAUGH, Schroeder Romero, 173A North 3rd Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)486-8992, through Feb. 14 . Evan Schwartz's New York solo debut, ''Reclaiming Puberty,'' is a document of transition from one gender to another. The series starts with family snapshots of the artist as a pre-adolescent girl and as a teenager in a floor-length gown on her way to a high school prom, then picks up as he assumes a male identity, through a regiment of hormone treatments and a double mastectomy. Celebratory in spirit, the show ends with a second prom photo, this one of Mr. Schwartz, handsome in a tux, with his arms around a young woman, his date. Also of interest is a small show of labor-intensive drawings by Michael Waugh. Most of them composed in lines of minute hand-written script, the text being a composite of presidential inaugural addresses from the past.  COTTER    Last Chance    THOMAS ALLEN: 'UNCOVERED,' Foley, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212)244-9081, closing tomorrow. Mr. Allen creates ''pop-up'' scenarios by cutting and folding selected figures from the covers of old paperbacks and other books; he then makes surprisingly dimensional color photographs of them. The screaming man at the top of a leaning stack of books looks like he is about to fall off a cliff. In ''Thirst,'' a sultry woman reaches from the cover of one book for the liquor bottle held by the man on a nearby volume.  JOHNSON    CHARLOTTE BECKET, Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0212, closing tomorrow. Ms. Becket's ''Wishing Well'' is a notable contribution to the department of extreme trash accumulation, kinetic division. Stacked tiers of paper, cardboard, bottles and other sorts of refuse sandwiched between sheets of plywood rise 10 feet in the air. In the middle of this tower of garbage, a vertical conveyor continuously churns up loose debris. It owes a lot to the work of Phoebe Washburn but has its own wacky humor and inventiveness.  JOHNSON    CHARLES DE WOLF BROWNELL: 'A DECADE OF TRAVEL, 1856-66,' Hirschl & Adler Galleries, 21 East 70th Street, (212)535-8810, through tomorrow. Brownell (1822-1909), a New England-born landscapist, did watercolors in Cuba over a 10-year period, while wintering on sugar and coffee plantations owned by his family there. His detailed record of the Cuban landscape ranges from close-up renditions of plants and foliage to a panoramic view -- the largest work in the show -- of the Bay of Matanzas, the region that was the center of the sugar industry. After his intensive Cuban period, he turned to views of the New England region where he grew up. Like his Cuban work, these are delicately painted, pleasant views that capture the flavor of the New England countryside, its mountains, trees, rivers and farms.  GLUECK    'THE CASTELLANI AND ITALIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL JEWELRY,' Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212)501-3000, closing on Sunday. A dazzling look at the redoubtable Castellani jewelry firm that lasted in Rome from 1814 to 1927 and its production of exquisitely wrought jewelry modeled on the Etruscan, Greek and Roman relics being dug up all over Italy. This is not a show for dilettantes, requiring strength of eye and the patience of Job for exquisite detail. But it's a spectacular, even for over-the-top, bling-bling-y New York. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $3; students and 65+, $2.  GLUECK    TONY FITZPATRICK: 'THE WONDER: PORTRAITS OF A REMEMBERED CITY,' Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-2144, closing on Monday. These densely knit concoctions of words and images may be nothing new, but they win you over with their emotion and erudition, both illuminating the greatness of Chicago, as well as their physical solidity. Bristling with an undiluted palette of red, black, white and marigold and dotted with images cut from old matchbook covers as well as poems and personal reminiscences, they conjure up the glamour of bygone hotels, clubs and sports legends while evoking everything from quiltmaking and tattooing to cloisonné and Neo-Expressionism. These works count as highly disciplined exercises in nostalgia: their specificity reveals something new about the time and place they yearn for, as well as the medium they so deftly explore.  ROBERTA SMITH    JIM GOLDBERG: 'TWO STORIES,' Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212)759-7999, closing tomorrow. For a series of photographic portraits called ''Rich and Poor'' that he made in the late 70's and early 80's, Mr. Goldberg had his visibly rich or poor subjects write their thoughts on the prints. The vivid sense of real persons that emerges is as compelling as anything you might learn about wealth or poverty. Another project, a kind of wrap-around bulletin board, is obscurely autobiographical.  JOHNSON    EMILE GUEBEHI AND MALICK SIDIBE, Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)645-1701, closing tomorrow. Lively studio portraits from 40 years and curious new photographs of heavy women seen from behind by Mr. Sidibe, the celebrated photographer from Mali, nicely complement the striking painted sculptures by the Ivory Coast-based Mr. Guebehi. Representing big, buxom women naked or partly naked and, in some cases, visibly pregnant, the sculptures look like the works of a self-taught artist with a thing for maternal women.  JOHNSON    *'A HEAVENLY CRAFT: THE WOODCUT IN EARLY PRINTED BOOKS,' Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212)838-6690, closing tomorrow. A lively overall view of the development of the woodcut is provided by this show of 15th- and 16th-century books acquired in the mid 1940's by Lessing J. Rosenwald, the Sears Roebuck heir, from the noted C.W. Dyson Perrins collection in England. Ranging from primitive to elegant in style, the books -- in themselves works by master printers -- contain illustrations by artists like Albrecht Dürer, Urs Graf and Hans Burgkmair, along with lesser names and the more frequent anonymities of the period. Among them are three rare editions of Aesop's fables; the ''Revelationes'' of St. Birgitta, produced in 1500 by the Nuremberg printer Anton Koberger; and the 1495 Florence folio edition, one of two in existence, of ''Epistolae et Evangeli,'' a book of Gospels and lessons of the Mass.  GLUECK    JAMES HYDE; RACHEL BERWICK, Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262, closing tomorrow. Mr. Hyde presents rectilinear wall-hung compositions made of raw lumber, chromed steel panels, clear vinyl, paint, photographs and other materials in his continuing, rigorously playful analysis of formalism, materialism and Modernist painting. Ms. Berwick's vivid wall-size video portraits of a rare Galapagos tortoise and a life-size cast in volcanic glass of a tortoise shell obliquely explore the intersection of natural and human histories.  JOHNSON    CHRISTIAN MARCLAY: 'SHAKE RATTLE AND ROLL (FLUXMIX),' Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105, closing tomorrow. In an installation by an artist known for hybridizing art and music, each of 16 video monitors in a circle show white-gloved hands gently playing with boxes, books, toys, photographs and other things belonging to a collection of works by Fluxus artists at the Walker Art Center. The various low-level noises produced by the hands and the objects generate a quiet, John Cage-style, surround-sound concert.  JOHNSON    'QUEENS INTERNATIONAL,' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700, closing on Sunday. The 40 artists here are all residents of the city's most cosmopolitan borough, though nearly a third were born outside the United States. In line with current curatorial trends, overt displays of ethnicity are played down and a certain blandness prevails. But there is some interesting work, including paintings by the Japanese-American Hideo Date, now 97 and a Queens resident for more than half a century. His two soft-grained figurative paintings from the 1930's and 40's emanate from a distant stylistic world, one that looks fine right now. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+.

This alternately pallid and garish revival of the 1983 musical, with songs by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein, comes to life only when its cross-dressing chorus line takes over. This story of a gay couple who run a nightclub in St. Tropez has two bright stars in Daniel Davis (as the manly part of the couple) and the wonderful but slightly miscast Gary Beach (as the womanly one). But Jerry Zaks's production often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include canned corn and packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers. Each one emerges as a saucy individual, and as a team they have been choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with a feisty sense of humor and an athletic verve that should make Arnold Schwarzenegger think twice about using girly men as a pejorative term (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.","excerpt":"Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $100.  BEN BRANTLEY    *+ 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly a half century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by a young Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the initially blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by brilliantly exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.  BRANTLEY    * 'DEMOCRACY.' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice them, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.  BRANTLEY    + 'GEM OF THE OCEAN.' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays that chronicles the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is over 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.  BRANTLEY    + ' 'NIGHT, MOTHER.' As your grandmother or therapist probably told you, there is something to be said for staying busy in a time of crisis. Playing a pair of women whose shared life is about to be torn asunder, Edie Falco and Brenda Blethyn have an ocean of household chores to swim through in the strangely uninvolving revival of Marsha Norman's '' 'Night, Mother.'' Putting candy in jars, cleaning out the refrigerator, bagging garbage: such tasks are sometimes enough even to eclipse the harsh awareness of Thelma Cates (Ms. Blethyn) that her daughter, Jessie (Ms. Falco), has announced that she will be killing herself in a couple of hours. On the other hand, all that domestic industry only rarely disguises our suspicion that these first-rate actresses are never quite at home in their roles. Or the uneasy realization that Ms. Norman's Pulitzer-winning drama is looking more artificial than it did 20 years ago (1:30). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    * 'PACIFIC OVERTURES.' The director Amon Miyamoto dazzled New Yorkers at the Lincoln Center Festival two years ago with his visiting Japanese-language production of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's 1976 musical about American gunboat diplomacy as visited on 19th-century Japan. Now Mr. Miyamoto has revisited the show with an English-speaking, predominantly Asian-American cast, including B. D. Wong as the wryly omniscient narrator. The show's scenic and conceptual elements are essentially the same. But something has definitely been lost in the retranslation. The production does give beguiling due to Mr. Sondheim's silken, silvery score. But an uneasy tentativeness pervades the stage like a mist of perspiration (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Curtain at 7 p.m. through Thursday. Tickets: $36.25 to $91.25.  BRANTLEY    '700 SUNDAYS.' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and perennial Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house in Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.  BRANTLEY    ++ 'WHOOPI.' Whoopi Goldberg has been working in Hollywood for two decades now. Presumably she's met a lot of directors out there. But scan the program for Ms. Goldberg's solo show, which has returned to Broadway for a 20th-anniversary engagement, and you'll find none listed. This movie star and television personality has chosen to dispense with one in remounting her collection of monologues, just as she did when this career-igniting show made its debut on Broadway. Twenty years ago the omission could be forgiven as the boundless confidence of a bright young talent. At 49 Ms. Goldberg is an established performer and the oversight looks more like folly. Ms. Goldberg's most ardent fans may be happy to make the acquaintance of the half dozen characters she portrays here. But even the funniest monologues would benefit from judicious editing (1:30). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays at 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $76.25.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    Off Broadway    + 'THE BALTIMORE WALTZ.' Paula Vogel is indisputably the author of ''The Baltimore Waltz,'' but a decade of collective grief, rage and confusion surely played a part in its authorship, too. Ms. Vogel began work on the play shortly after her brother's death from AIDS in 1988. It was a deeply personal, even idiosyncratic expression of sorrow and love. But in the dozen years since its premiere at Circle Repertory, emotion surrounding the AIDS epidemic has inevitably cooled, and the play now must stand up to less emotionally inflected scrutiny. Sadly, on the evidence of Mark Brokaw's smart but dry production, the second in the Signature Theater's season devoted to Ms. Vogel's work, it mostly sags. This is partly due to a crucial piece of miscasting. Kristen Johnston is a talented actress, but she doesn't do poignancy convincingly. She makes all the right noises, but the submerged emotional charge that should bind the jumbled comic gambits of Ms. Vogel's comedy never fully emerges (1:25). Signature's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, (212) 244-7529. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    'BELLE ÉPOQUE.' The époque doesn't seem so very belle in Martha Clarke and Charles L. Mee's ambitious attempt to distill onstage the seedy, absinthe-tinted glamour that Toulouse-Lautrec captured in oils and pastels in late 19th-century Paris. Mark Povinelli, an actor whose small stature belies a sizable force, plays Toulouse-Lautrec. He is surrounded by an eccentric array of performers who plied their trade in the clubs of Montmartre. With the aid of Jane Greenwood's plush, gorgeously detailed costumes and Christopher Akerlind's invigorating lighting, the production casts a seductive visual spell. But the musical and visual enticements of ''Belle Époque'' are encumbered by Mr. Mee's text, which often strikes an arch, discordant note (1:25). Mitzi E. Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m; Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $70.  ISHERWOOD    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE.' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.  BRANTLEY    'FAT PIG.' Neil LaBute's latest work is on one level yet another demonstration that men are paragons of bad faith and cowardice, a judgmental tradition that this writer established with his screenplay for ''In the Company of Men.'' Yet ''Fat Pig,'' directed by Jo Bonney, is also the most emotionally engaging and unsettling of Mr. LaBute's plays since ''Bash'' five years ago. A show that might have been merely a point-proving exercise is immeasurably enriched by Mr. LaBute's empathy and by the skill and honesty of Jeremey Piven (of ''The Entourage'' on HBO) as a charming rising executive, and and Ashlie Atkinson, the overweight woman he falls for. Andrew McCarthy and Keri Russell (late of ''Felicity'') round out the taut ensemble (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    'THE FOREIGNER.' Matthew Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There is no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. The production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25.  BRANTLEY    +'MODERN ORTHODOX.' It is said that God works in mysterious ways. Daniel Goldfarb's new play suggests He is not above employing obnoxious ones, too. In this snappy if superficial romantic comedy with a glossy cast (Molly Ringwald, Jason Biggs and Craig Bierko), Hannah and Ben, a young Jewish couple comfortably ensconced on Manhattan's Upper West Side, are provoked to question their commitment to each other -- and the depth of their religious feeling -- when Hershel Klein, an ill-mannered interloper from another borough and another sect, arrives on their doorstep demanding to be given harbor. Since the abrasive behavior of Hershel, played by Mr. Biggs, tends to indicate colossal bad manners more powerfully than spiritual enlightenment, the character's deployment as a catalyst is more than a little specious. But the soul-searching is primarily filler supplementing Mr. Goldfarb's bright comic swipes at intrafaith cultural clashes (1:30). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $46 to $66.  ISHERWOOD    * 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE.' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naïve, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 925-1900. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3. Tickets: $60; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at box office one hour before the show.  ISHERWOOD    'A SECOND HAND MEMORY.' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Amid the pervasive aura of doom, Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors, who include Dominic Chianese of ''The Sopranos'' and a particularly fine Beth Fowler, provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences before our eyes, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $60.  ISHERWOOD    Last Chance    'FIVE BY TENN.' This selection of Tennessee Williams one-acts offers little cause for excitement. The four recently discovered plays are of some academic interest, but sparkling gems they aren't. ''Summer at the Lake,'' written in 1937, features principal characters who prefigure the combative mother and son in ''The Glass Menagerie.'' The play is just a fragment truncated by a melodramatic ending, but the voice already bears the hallmarks of Williams's style. But elsewhere the voice is diluted, distorted or disguised. The major disappointment is ''And Tell Sad Stories of the Deaths of Queens,'' from around 1959, a sour story of a transvestite's degradation at the hands of a sailor, and one of a very few plays in which Williams dealt directly with homosexuality (3:00). Manhattan Theater Club, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $48; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets available at the box office up to an hour before the performance.  ISHERWOOD    *+ 'GUANTÁNAMO: ''HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM.'' ' On an anxious night you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: you are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. This calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.  BRANTLEY    *++ 'RECKLESS.' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end you may feel as if you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling, sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51 to $79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'RODNEY'S WIFE.' Seemingly light conversation scrapes the skins of the characters in Richard Nelson's sharply etched study of dislocation, loneliness and sexual betrayal, directed by the playwright and and starring David Strathairn as a fading American movie star working in Rome. And you are always aware of the strain and snappishness that arises when people politely avoid saying what is on everyone's mind. Long before the unspoken is brought out for airing, Mr. Nelson and his fine cast have created a full emotional geography of a family, replete with deserts and bogs and patches of quicksand. Though the play, which traces the conflicts among the women in the life of Mr. Strathairn's alcoholic character, is centered on what movie ads used to call an ''illicit passion,'' there is nothing prurient about this production. What it offers instead is a deep and sorrowful understanding of how much loneliness there often is in lust (1:45). Playwrights Horizons Mainstage Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55.  BRANTLEY    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    Now Playing    'AFTER MIDNIGHT' Starring Giorgio Pasotti and Francesca Inaudi. Directed by Davide Ferrario (not rated, 89 minutes; in Italian, with English subtitles). This whimsical romantic comedy served with a heaping tablespoon of sugar is drenched in even more esoteric movie lore than that sentimental Italian crowd-pleaser ''Cinema Paradiso.'' Its poker-faced protagonist, Martino (Mr. Pasotti), is a wistful sad-eyed hermit who works as the custodian of Italy's National Museum of Cinema in Turin. Inside this solitary twilight world, he lives and works surrounded by old movie reels, vintage cameras and projectors. He is abruptly drawn out of his shell when a beautiful woman (Ms. Inaudi) on the run from the law seeks asylum in the museum. Depending on your tolerance for incessant movie references you may find ''After Midnight'' endearing or cloying.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'ALEXANDER' Starring Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 173 minutes). There comes the moment in the career of many directors when they are compelled to tell the story of a great man in whose life they seem to see a glimmer of their own image. Martin Scorsese and Mel Gibson each had Jesus. Now Oliver Stone has Alexander the Great, the Macedonian tyrant who cut a bloody swath through the ancient world to no obvious end other than, if Mr. Stone's big, blowsy movie is to believed, to get away from his kvetch of a mother. Olympias, played with nose-flaring gusto by Ms. Jolie, was the mother of all monstrous mothers, a literal snake charmer whose love for her only son had the stench of incestuous passion. For Alexander (Mr. Farrell, upstaged by an epically bad dye job), the Oedipal plot would only thicken because he also loved Olympias's most loathed enemy, her husband and his father, Philip, the King of Macedon (Mr. Kilmer). The struggle between Olympias and Philip, these primordial warring female and male forces, would be reproduced in Alexander's bisexual desires and his rapacious conquest of the feminized East. In other words, Alexander became his dad to waylay his mom.  MANOHLA DARGIS    * 'BAD EDUCATION' Starring Gael García Bernal, Fele Martínez and Javier Cámara. Directed by Pedro Almodóvar (NC-17; 110 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). This Spanish director's newest film is a delirious, headlong immersion and reinvention of film noir, a style that has lured countless filmmakers onto its treacherous shoals. Mr. Almodóvar, unlike other filmmakers who lose their bearings, fully understands the degree to which the genre is synonymous with fantasy and a primal longing for the forbidden. The coup de grâce of ''Bad Education'' is that here the femme fatale is a predatory transsexual named Ignacio. ''Bad Education'' contemplates the wonder of storytelling and the human instinct to embroider reality to make the tales we tell more real and conclusive, if less strictly factual.  HOLDEN    'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her longtime director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair, the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core. But Ms. Bening lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will.  A.O. SCOTT    'BLADE: TRINITY' Starring Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson and Jessica Biel. Directed by David S. Goyer (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Snipes may have achieved the Hollywood dream of starring in a comic-book franchise that doesn't require real acting, but he doesn't seem to appreciate his good fortune in the disjointed, overlong ''Blade: Trinity,'' which bills itself as the series finale. The ''Blade'' movies demand only that the 42-year-old actor stay pumped up and ready for kung-fu action. But the only emotion his character, a glowering half-human, half-vampire-hunter of the undead, can muster in the third installment is a sense of mild irritation at having to go through the hassle. This episode is a choppy, forgetful, suspense-free romp that substitutes campy humor for chills.  HOLDEN    'BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON' Starring Renée Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Directed by Beeban Kidron (R, 108 minutes). What was Ms. Zellweger thinking? It can't have been fun to put on all that weight, especially for a film as ghastly as this, and it sure won't be fun taking it off. And what is the appeal of Bridget Jones? More to the point, what is the appeal of laughing at her swishing thighs, her lack of charm and obvious intelligence? Unlike Sharon Maguire, who directed ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' Ms. Kidron goes out of her way to make the character unattractive, sticking the camera under Bridget's chin and doing nothing nice with the lighting. Bridget is pleasantly plump in the first movie, but here she's a greasy, bumbling, waddling train wreck.  DARGIS    'CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS' Starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by Joe Roth (PG, 94 minutes). Lockstep suburban conformism enforced with a fascist rigor is the ugly (but admittedly sometimes funny) joke driving this family comedy. The movie is as slick and treacherous as the sheet of ice its Scrooge-like protagonist (Mr. Allen) freezes in the yard of his lawn to discourage holiday panhandlers. For all you fancy-schmancy snobs who jet off to St. Bart's for the holidays, the movie has an important message, and you'd better pay attention. If you shirkers refuse to stay home and celebrate Christmas like the rest of us, we don't want you in our community.  HOLDEN    'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play and exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The actors work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen -- raw, brash and witty -- succeeds.  SCOTT    'FINDING NEVERLAND' Starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. Directed by Marc Forster (PG, 108 minutes). Steeped in melancholy, the strange story of J. M. Barrie, the Victorian who wrote ''Peter Pan,'' has the makings of a marvelous tale and one doozy of a case history. Barrie was a playwright and novelist who, after meeting a family stuffed with young boys, created in 1904 a classic of children's literature. In the years since, ''Peter Pan'' has been revisited numerous times. Mary Martin soared as Peter Pan; Michael Jackson crashed. As Barrie in ''Finding Neverland,'' a handsome-looking film about the writer and his unripe inspirations, Mr. Depp neither soars nor crashes, but moseys forward with vague purpose and actorly restraint. The film mainly concerns the period during which Barrie met and befriended the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Ms. Winslet) and her brood of boys. The filmmakers work hard to let us know that it's the mother who's the more obvious focus of the writer's attention than her children. It's all terribly polite, not a little dull and remote.  DARGIS    *  'HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS' Starring Zhang Ziyi. Directed by Zhang Yimou (PG-13, 119 minutes; in Mandarin, with English subtitles). In the latest chapter of Mr. Zhang's triumphant reinvention as an action filmmaker, Ms. Zhang plays Mei, a blind courtesan who turns out to be a member of the Flying Daggers, a shadowy squad of assassins waging a guerrilla insurgency against the corrupt and decadent government. She is pursued by two government deputies, Leo (Andy Lau) and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro), whose loyalties come into question as the chase turns into a love triangle. Everyone is engaged in several layers of deceit, and some of the third-act revelations are more likely to provoke laughter than gasps of amazement. But realism is as irrelevant a criterion here as it would be in an Italian opera. The movie is about color, kineticism and the kind of heavy-breathing, decorous sensuality that went out of American movies when sexual candor came in. Though it is in constant, breathtaking motion, the picture is not especially moving. Unlike the greatest operas (in whatever medium), it inspires you to gasp, but not to weep.  SCOTT    * 'THE INCREDIBLES' With the voices of Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter. Written and directed by Brad Bird (PG, 118 minutes). A family of superheroes tries to fit in in the suburbs after a public backlash against costumed crime fighters has forced superheroes into dull, ordinary lives. Mom and especially Dad -- once known as Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible -- are stuck in a midlife, middle-class malaise until a supervillain named Syndrome emerges to call them back to their old identities. Mr. Bird uses the plight of the superheroes as a way to protest against the celebration of mediocrity in a world in which ''everybody is special, so no one is.'' His fusion of Ayn Rand's philosophy with classic comic-book aesthetics results in a film that is witty, elegant and heartfelt. It falls short of its potential, though, when it succumbs to the imperatives of blockbuster ideology.  SCOTT    *  'KINSEY' Starring Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Peter Sarsgaard. Directed by Bill Condon (R, 118 minutes). Mr. Neeson is flawless as Alfred Kinsey, the zoologist whose research into human sexual behavior helped to transform American attitudes about matters of the flesh. Though it has its share of carnality, Mr. Condon's wise and witty biography is, above all, an intellectual turn-on, its romance fueled by Kinsey's scientific zeal and his ardent, almost naïve belief that knowledge is not only power, but freedom. While acknowledging Kinsey's personal failings and misjudgment, the film regards its hero with affection and gratitude, and makes its case for his legacy with tact and care. Though it sometimes falls into biopic convention, explaining what it should dramatize and dramatizing what it should imply, the film is rich with humanity and insight.  SCOTT    'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Aquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations. The pleasures of this movie are like those of a beautifully illustrated, haphazardly plotted picture book, which precocious children (and nostalgic adults) can linger over, feeding their reveries and fantasies.  SCOTT    * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael García Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. García Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture, a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography.  SCOTT    * 'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in the enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick ''Ocean's Twelve,'' a trio of crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean -- played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box-office entertainment, ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack, Mr. Pitt plays his second-in-command Rusty Ryan and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs.  DARGIS    'NATIONAL TREASURE' Starring Nicolas Cage. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 125 minutes). Maybe, just maybe, an 8-year-old could pick up an interest in American history from watching ''National Treasure,'' that is if the child can stay awake through this sluggish two-hour trudge through landmarks in Washington, Philadelphia and New York. It's far more likely, however, that a child who can stay awake through the movie will come away believing the bogus mythology that detonates this fanciful reality game show with a squishy thud. That mythology, derived from Freemasonry, holds that a map, drawn in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence, contains clues to the whereabouts of the Greatest Treasure Ever Told About. A more cynical (and witless, shoddy) chase for Hollywood gold is hard to imagine.  HOLDEN    'THE POLAR EXPRESS' With the voices of Tom Hanks, Michael Jeter, Peter Scolare, Nona Gaye, Eddie Deezen and Charles Fleischer. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (G, 97 minutes). Based on the 32-page children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, this new animated feature has received attention for the advanced technology used to make the film and the heart-skipping amount of money reportedly spent to transpose the story from page to screen. I suspect that most moviegoers care more about stories and characters than how much money it took for a digitally rendered strand of hair to flutter persuasively in the wind. Nor will they care that to make ''Polar Express'' Mr. Hanks wore a little cap that transmitted a record of his movements to a computer, creating templates for five animated characters. It's likely, I imagine, that most moviegoers will be more concerned by the eerie listlessness of those characters' faces and the grim vision of Santa Claus's North Pole compound.  DARGIS    * 'RAY' Starring Jamie Foxx. Directed by Taylor Hackford (PG-13, 152 minutes). Mr. Hackford's biography of Ray Charles does not entirely avoid the psychologizing, sentimental traps of the genre, but it is nonetheless a potent and invigorating portrait of genius, thanks to Mr. Foxx's performance and to the music of Charles himself. The filmmakers have the good judgment to place the music at the center of the drama, and the movie is full of insights into Charles's innovations and working methods. The story of musical accomplishment is framed by the usual trials and triumphs of celebrity, but a handful of fine supporting performances gives it a feeling of life being lived, rather than just acted out.  SCOTT    * 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack it's an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future.  DARGIS    'THE SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS MOVIE' With the voices of Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown and Rodger Bumpass. Directed by Steven Hillenburg (PG, 88 minutes). If nautical nonsense is something you wish for, then this big-screen expansion of the popular Nickelodeon show will be just the ticket. SpongeBob and his best pal Patrick set off on a rambling quest to recover a stolen crown and prevent Plankton from taking over Bikini Bottom and driving poor Mr. Krabs out of business. If none of this makes sense to you, fear not; it won't necessarily make any more after the movie is done. In any case, the point of ''SpongeBob'' is not sense but nonsense, and the film, like the series, is a giddy celebration of pure childishness, which makes it a refreshing antidote to the glowering machismo that dominates so much pop culture.  SCOTT    * 'A TALKING PICTURE' Starring Leonor Silveira. Directed by Manoel de Oliveira (not rated, 95 minutes; in Portuguese, French and Italian, with English subtitles). With this sharply cut gem of a film, Mr. Oliveira again shows himself to be a master of the medium. Set in the present, his latest film centers on a history professor named Rosa Maria (Ms. Silveira), and her 7-year-old daughter who are sailing the Mediterranean on their way to Bombay. As they stop at ports from France to Turkey, the film takes the shape of a genial history lesson, one that grows progressively darker when you realize the message Mr. Oliveira has been delivering alongside all those seemingly benign tourist shots. It would give away too much to say what happens at the end of this dark journey across the geography of our current reality, only that this is the only film I can think of that, in the aftermath of Sept. 11, has so directly addressed the war on liberal democracies.  DARGIS    * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade.  DARGIS    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, the film follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to do them part, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amélie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes. DARGIS    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent rock and pop concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * ANTIBALAS, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Antibalas, which recently released its third album, ''Who Is This America?'' (Ropeadope), gives a New York makeover to Fela Kuti's Afro-beat, the Nigerian funk propelled by burly saxophones, fierce percussion and righteous anger. It updates the funk and the political messages. Regular local appearances keep tightening up the band, and it's a show just watching more than a dozen musicians cram themselves onto a club stage and still find room to dance. Tonight at midnight; admission, $16 with a $15 minimum at the tables.  JON PARELES    ASHFORD AND SIMPSON, JERRY BUTLER, THE MANHATTANS, THE PERSUADERS, THE IMPRESSIONS, RAY, GOODMAN AND BROWN, Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, Brooklyn College, Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, Flatbush, (718) 951-4500. A generous bill of smooth soul, with the paeans to fidelity of Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson, the gospel-charged Chicago soul of Jerry Butler, and the close harmonies and sweet promises of the Manhattans, the Impressions, the Persuaders and Ray, Goodman and Brown. Sunday night at 6; admission, $45 and $65.  PARELES    BEANS, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236. Beans, formerly a member of the Anti-Pop Consortium, delivers sinuous, idiosyncratic hip-hop verses set to twitchy electronic beats. In October he released his second full-length solo album, ''Shock City Maverick'' (Beans), full of brittle electro tracks and rapping that sounds as if it could go on forever; the effect is often more impressive on stage than on CD. Tomorrow night doors open at 8, with Dub Trio and the Gray Kid; tickets are $10.  KELEFA SANNEH    BREAKING BENJAMIN, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500. This grim-faced metal-grunge band sings about betrayal and alienation over bruising, down-tuned guitar riffs on its way to pop choruses. Like many other bands, it owes a lot to Tool, but its edge comes from its collaborator in songwriting, Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins. Sunday night, doors open at 6, with Flyleaf, Halogen and Thread opening; tickets, $15 in advance, $17 on Sunday.  PARELES    * SIMON CHARDIET, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500. Simon Chardiet is the kind of guitarist that bar-band fans dream of finding: a one-man twang meltdown who knows where surf meets blues, rockabilly meets klezmer, country meets punk. His songs are wryly frustrated; his guitar solos assuage his troubles with the grand sweep of American music. Tonight at 10; free admission.  PARELES    CONCERT FOR HAITI, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Haiti has been battered lately by Hurricane Jeanne and political turmoil. This concert raises money for Artists' Relief Fund for Haiti, and it brings together a hip-hop musician with Haitian roots -- Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, and his Refugee Crew -- with a lineup of Haitian musicians, including the jazzy compas band Zin, Dadou Pasquet, Eddy François, Michou, St. Juste and others. Sunday night at 7; tickets, $20, with a $15 minimum at the tables.  PARELES    ELYSIAN FIELDS, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. With Jennifer Charles's smoky voice and Oren Bloedow's electric guitar, Elysian Fields conjure a haunted, late-night atmosphere with songs full of love and trouble. Tonight at 9; tickets, $12.  PARELES    MIKE ERRICO, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. This songwriter ponders love, God, fame, drinking and ''light conversation when there's nothing left to say,'' with his voice quavering and shambling around the strumming of his guitar. For these shows he's bringing a full band and his Holiday Omens, predicting the future of audience members. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets, $12 in advance, $15 tomorrow, with a two-drink or $12 minimum.  PARELES    THE FANTASTIC FOUR, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Here's yet another jam-band recombination. It should revolve around funk, as it brings together Robert Walter, the keyboardist who leads his 20th Congress, with Eric Krasno, the guitarist in Soulive. Cheme Gastelum, the saxophonist from 20th Congress, and Adam Deith, on drums from the band Lettuce, complete the quartet. Tomorrow night at midnight in the Main Space; tickets are $12 in advance, $15 tomorrow.  PARELES    * 50 FOOT WAVE, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Avenue A, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Kristin Hersh was the songwriter behind the jumpy, oddly cantilevered tunes and surreal imagery of Throwing Muses. After a stretch of more serene songs, she has started her hardest-rocking group yet, the trio 50 Foot Wave, which can sound like Throwing Muses charged up by Husker Du. Tonight at 11, with Aberdeen City at 10, Anders Parker of Varnaline at 9 and Redletter at 8; the admission is $12.  PARELES    HOWARD FISHMAN QUARTET, Pete's Candy Store, 709 Lorimer Street, off Frost Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-3770. Howard Fishman, a singer and guitarist, leads a group that often harks back to 1930's jazz, but doesn't get stuck in revivalism. It just can't resist poking around America's musical basements and attics. Tomorrow night at 10:30, after the Hipster's Holiday Show revue at 7. Admission is free.  PARELES    * JOANNA NEWSOM, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Earlier this year this extraordinary harpist and singer-songwriter released ''The Milk-Eyed Mender'' (Drag City), full of beautiful, intensely self-aware songs that flirt with nonsense. While Ms. Newsom she picks broken chords on the harp, her riveting voice swoops from an elegant sigh up to a throaty yawp and back. And often her seemingly indecipherable lyrics (''There are bats all dissolving in a row'') suddenly turn shivery and direct: ''O, morning without warning like a hole/ And I watch you go.'' These are Christmas concerts, and there's a dress code: ''A sweater with a knit cap or scarf, please.'' Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday night at 7:30; tickets, $15.  SANNEH    MIRACLE ON 125TH STREET, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5301. Here's an odd pairing for a Christmas concert: Be Be Winans, a member of pop-gospel's leading family, and the songwriter Carly Simon, making a rare live public appearance. They will be singing Christmas songs and their own hits; Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20 is also scheduled to appear. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets, $55 to $300.  PARELES    SCISSOR SISTERS/VHS OR BETA, Hammerstein Ballroom at the Manhattan Center, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-7740. Twisted 1970's revivalism powers the Scissor Sisters, who put themselves on the map with a disco-powered remake of Pink Floyd's ''Comfortably Numb'' and show an unabashed fondness for Elton John. VHS or Beta is a band from Kentucky, but it could just as easily come from the downtown New York scene that is delving into the dance-rock hybrids of the early 1980's. Sunday night, doors open at 6:30; tickets, $25.  PARELES    * JANE SIBERRY, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Ms. Siberry is always trying another collaboration or another musical strategy. Her sweetly tousled voice, her sly intelligence, her determination to explore and her playful fascination with family, archetype and myth can all lead to intimate epiphanies. Tonight at 7; tickets, $25 with a two-drink or $12 minimum.  PARELES    RONNIE SPECTOR'S CHRISTMAS PARTY, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Mr. Spector has been belting Christmas songs since her days as the leader of the Ronnettes. Along with ''Frosty the Snowman'' and ''I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus,'' her contributions to Phil Spector's 1963 Christmas album, she's also likely to apply her gutsy voice to her indelible hits, like ''Be My Baby.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 9; tickets, $30 in advance, $35 the day of show, with a $10 minimum.  PARELES    TAVERAS/FRANCE JOLI, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, at 11th Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 239-2672. The five Taveras brothers harmonized on mid-1970's hits that helped usher in the disco era, among them ''It Only Takes a Minute'' and ''More Than a Woman.'' France Joli was a teenager when she had her biggest dance hit, ''Come to Me,'' in 1979. Sunday night at 9:30; admission, $20, $10 with a coupon from www.copacabanany.com.  PARELES    * DANNY TENAGLIA, Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 268-9477. Mr. Tenaglia is one of the city's greatest and most reliable -- and most relentless -- dance-music D.J.'s. Expect a long, delirious night: Mr. Tenaglia is beloved not only for his catholic approach to house music (from clattering rhythm-only tracks to sleek electronic confections), but for his extraordinary stamina too. Tonight after 10; tickets, $35.  SANNEH    WHITE OUT, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. The improvising duo of Lin Culbertson, on synthesizers and vocals, and Tom Surgal on drums, gets even noisier with two guest guitarists, Thurston Moore and Jim O'Rourke from Sonic Youth. Tomorrow night at 8 and 10; admission, $12 a set.  PARELES    PAUL WINTER, Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at West 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 662-2133. Mr. Winter's annual winter solstice shows are reverent one-world pageants and ecumenical rituals, full of reassurance, good intentions and candy-coated exoticism. This is his 25th solstice celebration, and it promises to be the most theatrical, complete with an appearance by the aerialist Philippe Petit. Mr. Winter's jazz-tinged New Age ensemble will be joined by the uilleann piper Davy Spillane, from Ireland; the hand-drum virtuoso Glen Velez; the 18-member African-American Forces of Nature dance and percussion ensemble; and the Dmitri Pokrovsky Ensemble, a nine-member Russian vocal and dance group. Tonight at 7:30 and tomorrow at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; tickets, $32 to $72.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    BABY JANE DEXTER, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609. Ms. Dexter, a natural rock-blues belter who refrains from full-tilt shouting, roams all over the place, from Cole Porter to R.E.M. to Rod McKuen to the Rolling Stones, in her new show ''Bread and Gravy.'' If her bold re-evaluations of songs don't always work, they tear away the associations crusted on songs we think we know to reveal new avenues of interpretation. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9:15. Cover: $25; $15 minimum.  HOLDEN    * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, Manhattan, (212) 339-4095. The smoothest crooner in show business and one of the most dedicated archivists of popular song salutes Christmas, Hanukkah and the classic ballad in his show, ''Holiday Heart Songs.'' Mr. Feinstein has developed into such an accomplished stand-up entertainer that if it were 1965, he would be the host of his own network variety show. The ballads at which he excels include ''Two for the Road,'' ''I Concentrate on You,'' and John Bucchino's semiclassical ''Grateful.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $60; $40 minimum for the early shows and $30 minimum for the late shows.  HOLDEN    JASON GRAAE, Helen's (see above). A biting wit that flirts with sarcasm and a real singing voice are talents that don't often coincide in the same performer. But Mr. Graae, a show-business jack-in-the-box in the twilight of his potential as a Broadway juvenile lead has both. As a bonus, he plays the clarinet and oboe. Part music, part comedy, his engaging show ''Coupe de Graae'' is a whip-smart insider's tour of the show-business scuffle from New York to Los Angeles. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7. Cover: $25; two-drink minimum.  HOLDEN    * ANDREA MARCOVICCI, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. Authentic glamour may be an oxymoron. But Ms. Marcovicci becomes its embodiment when she performs. In her new show, ''Andrea Sings Astaire,'' she suggests a latter-day hybrid of Audrey Hepburn, the most gracious, elegant and beautifully spoken of Hollywood princesses, and Mabel Mercer, that ruefully witty, all-wise, healing muse of a thousand romantic sorrows. Like Mercer's, her singing is really speech-song executed with an elocutionary flourish and stylized acting. The show weaves music, biography and analysis of Astaire iconography into a definitive career summary. It focuses, in particular, on his relationships with the composers who wrote for him. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $60, with a $55 dinner required at the early shows and a $20 minimum at the late shows.  HOLDEN    * 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212) 581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue, ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging, 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $40.  HOLDEN    BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semiretirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his signature songs -- ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark'' -- along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $95.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * PETER BERNSTEIN QUARTET WITH BRAD MEHLDAU, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. The guitarist Peter Bernstein was all over the small jazz clubs in New York 10 years ago, as was the pianist Brad Mehldau. Here Mr. Mehldau plays sideman to Mr. Bernstein, with Larry Grenadier on bass and Bill Stewart on drums. They've done this before, for ''Heart's Content,'' a recent album on Criss Cross, and a few recent gigs in New York, at which Mr. Bernstein played his organized, burnished Grant Green-inspired style to perfection, and Mr. Mehldau went far out on thrilling tangents that you don't hear as much in his own band. Sets are tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 9, 11 and 12:30 p.m.; cover charge, $25 with a $10 minimum.  BEN RATLIFF    HENRY GRIMES TRIO, Church of St. Luke in the Fields, 487 Hudson Street, at Grove, West Village, (212) 924-0562. Since his great comeback last year, the bassist Henry Grimes has played in trios with dozens of musicians. This is a new group, with the saxophonist Charles Gayle -- an icon of second-wave free jazz -- and the drummer Chad Taylor. Tonight at 8 p.m.; admission, $15.  RATLIFF    ROY HARGROVE AND CEDAR WALTON QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Usually Jackie McLean has been the horn soloist in front of Cedar Walton's piano trio at the Vanguard for the two weeks before Christmas. When he was sidelined last year with an injury, his fill-in was the trumpeter Roy Hargrove, whose investigations in ballads and bop and expressive melodic improvisation keep sounding more mature. Both he and Mr. Walton have decided that the experiment worked. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11 p.m.; cover charge, $20 with a $10 drink minimum.  RATLIFF    JUNIOR MANCE TRIO, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. In his mid-70's, Mr. Mance is an excitable, physical player who throws himself into fast tempos and splashy, jubilant fancies that are not heard much outside Oscar Peterson. But he is also an earthy blues-and-bop player from Chicago; his résumé includes time in the bands of Dinah Washington, Dizzy Gillespie and Cannonball Adderley. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge, $20 with a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    ORGAN SUMMIT WITH JIMMY McGRIFF, DR. LONNIE SMITH, REUBEN WILSON, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2121. The sound of the Hammond B-3 organ, tenor saxophone and guitar has aged well, as it turns out: no matter how tightly it clings to its clichés, it is a durable American music, an effective R & B-ization of the jazz repertory and a jazz-ization of the R & B repertory. These are organists of the same generation: Jimmy McGriff, Lonnie Smith and Reuben Wilson all started out in the early 60's. And here they go up against one another, wringing earthy soul out of their instrument. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set tomorrow; cover charge, $32.50 tonight and Sunday, $35 tomorrow with a $10 minimum all nights.  RATLIFF    * MARCUS ROBERTS TRIO, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, www.jazzlincolncenter.org. What makes Mr. Roberts special, rather than just a gifted pianist with a deep, clean touch and a good historian of jazz from ragtime onward, is the way he moves against type. He is a self-conscious performer who loves melody, speed, volume and polyrhythm and knows that audiences like those things too. But finally all these devices work in the service of creating chilling moments. Sometimes he chords thickly through a few choruses of a song, growing louder and louder -- and even insanely loud -- or finishes a song by depressing some keys and holding them there for a minute. These are tricks, but they are audience-demolishers. His trio includes Roland Guerin on bass and Jason Marsalis on drums. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11 p.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge, $30 with a $10 minimum at the tables and a $5 minimum at the bar.  RATLIFF    ADAM ROGERS GROUP, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883. Adam Rogers is easily one of the best jazz guitarists in New York, the next step in the tradition of swinging mainstream players -- in the line of Pat Martino and George Benson, though he can detour into rock and country as well. Music is tonight at 10 and 11:45. Cover charge, $10 with a two-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    * 'SUITE FOR HUMAN NATURE': LINCOLN CENTER JAZZ ORCHESTRA, Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500. It's the latest long-form piece by Wynton Marsalis, this one commissioned by the Washington Performing Arts Society, with a libretto by Diane Charlotte Lampert. It is a fable about Mother Nature and Father Time, for children as well as adults, featuring the orchestra led by Mr. Marsalis and the singers Milt Grayson and Jennifer Sanon, as well as the Boys Choir of Harlem. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m.; tickets, $10 to $150.  RATLIFF    TANGO MEETS JAZZ FESTIVAL, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. The Argentine pianist and composer Pablo Ziegler, a protégé of Astor Piazzola who recorded an album of tango piano duets with Emanuel Ax not long ago, has been working on an original version of tango-jazz. He brings a fairly full realization of it to the Jazz Standard this weekend, for the second year running, with this regular Argentine quartet and special guest soloists: the vibraphonist Stefon Harris (tonight) and the tenor-saxophonist David Sanchez (tomorrow and Sunday). Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge, $30 and $25 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    * TOM VARNER GROUP, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319. Imagining yourself as a French horn player in jazz is half the battle; after that, original ideas about composition and material must come easily. Mr. Varner has distinguished himself in recent years by shifting around from brainy, Europeanish improv to the purely American repertory of country and gospel. Tonight he will play new compositions made possible by a grant from the Doris Duke Foundation, using his regular band of Steve Wilson and Tony Malaby on saxophones, Cameron Brown on bass and Tom Rainey on drums. Music starts tonight at 8:30; cover charge, $8 with a $6 minimum per set.  RATLIFF    * MIGUEL ZENON QUARTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. The young alto saxophonist Miguel Zenon is a burning player with an equally ferocious sense of organization. From his first album three years ago he seemed unusually evolved, with strong and light saxophone sound; his composing exhibits a broad intellect busily chewing up new jazz harmony and folkloric music of his native Puerto Rico, and now he has a strong working band (with Luis Perdomo on piano, Hans Glawischnig on bass, Antonio Sanchez on drums). I've seen him twice in recent months and both shows were among the best I've seen all year. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission, $15 a set, $10 for members.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances:  nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'RODELINDA' Most of Handel's operas were introduced at the King's Theater in London, a house of 850 seats. But for its premiere production of Handel's ''Rodelinda,'' a musically rich and psychologically complex masterpiece, the Met proves that with the right approach and the right cast Handel can be presented effectively in a grand-size house. Renée Fleming brings her radiant voice and courageous vulnerability to her performance of the title character, the despairing queen of the Lombard king of Milan, Bertarido, who has been usurped and is thought dead. In tomorrow's performance the fine countertenor David Walker takes over the role of Bertarido from David Daniels. The refined tenor Kobie van Rensburg, the powerhouse mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe and the sweet-voiced countertenor Bejun Mehta are also excellent. The handsome production, directed by Stephen Wadsworth in his Met debut, sets the 7th-century story in early 18th-century Milan. Harry Bicket, also making his company debut, conducts with fleetness and assurance. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $145 to $215.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    'TANNHÄUSER' At 50, the German dramatic tenor Peter Seiffert, who has a major career in Europe, has finally made his Metropolitan Opera debut in the daunting title role of Wagner's ''Tannhäuser,'' a revival of Otto Schenk's handsomely realistic 1977 production. For Met fans it was worth the wait. Mr. Seiffert has all the power and stamina you could want from a Wagnerian tenor and, rarer, true tenorial colorings and impressive vocal agility. Though he has a barrel-chested physique, he gives a charismatic, physically nimble and sympathetic portrayal of the medieval knight and song minstrel torn between the erotic pleasures of Venus and the idealized love of Elisabeth. Singing her first Elisabeth at the Met, the dramatic soprano Deborah Voigt is in glorious voice. Michelle DeYoung makes a dusky-toned and alluring Venus. Thomas Hampson brings the elegance of the fine German lieder singer he is to his distinguished and vocally robust portrayal of Wolfram. Mark Elder conducts a lithe and vividly colored performance. Tomorrow afternoon at 1, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Sold out, but returns may be available.  TOMMASINI    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. This weekend the barge offers all six of Beethoven's early Opus 18 quartets: brilliant and austere works that announced Beethoven's genius in a genre that would become one of his most important. (Tonight features Nos. 1, 2 and 3; tomorrow and Sunday feature Nos. 4, 5 and 6.) The performers include the violinist Mark Peskanov, who is Bargemusic's artistic director, and Jonathan Gandelsman, an eloquent and charismatic young violinist who has appeared with Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Ensemble. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $20.  JEREMY EICHLER    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER It has become the custom of the Chamber Music Society, and a handful of other ensembles, to walk through Bach's six ''Brandenburg'' Concertos every year during this holiday season. And why not? The society's players know them well and have given polished, vibrant traversals of the set. And listeners in search of a festive but nondenominational program could do worse than to spend a couple of hours with these pieces, in which Bach gives everyone -- violinists, flutists, trumpet players, harpsichordists and violas and cellists -- a share of the spotlight. Sunday at 5 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788. Sold out, but returns may be available at the box office.  ALLAN KOZINN    JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET For all the talk about classical music being elitist and expensive, there are affordable and even free classical music offerings in New York all the time, notably, the Peoples' Symphony Concerts. For its concert in this popular series tomorrow night the Juilliard Quartet plays three of the greatest string quartets: Haydn's Quartet in D, Op. 76, No. 5; Bartok's Third, the most experimental of the six Bartok quartets; and my favorite of Beethoven's three ''Rasoumovsky'' Quartets, Op. 59, No. 2, in E minor. Single tickets are just $9 -- cheaper than a movie. Tomorrow night at 8, Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680.  TOMMASINI    LIONHEART This vocal sextet, which specializes in medieval music (with periodic forays into contemporary works), and is presenting ''Tydyngs Trew,'' its program of carols, hymns and motets composed for the feasts surrounding Christmas in medieval England. The program begins with works commemorating the Feast of the Annunciation (on March 25), as well as several ancient Christmas carols. But it is not all seasonal cheeriness. Carols for the Feast of the Holy Innocents recall Herod's slaughter of children, and the colorful ''Seynt Thomas Honour We'' commemorates the murder of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, by King Henry II's knights on Dec. 29, 1170. If this isn't today's standard holiday fare, it offers an interesting glimpse into the traditions and attitudes of a distant era. Sunday at 1 and 3 p.m., the Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 650-2290. Tickets: $35.  KOZINN    * MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE James Levine allows the extraordinary musicians of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra frequent forays into the spotlight, both as a full orchestra at Carnegie Hall and in chamber guises at Weill Recital Hall. The next installment of the chamber series is on Sunday, when the musicians perform Bach's Cantata No. 82 (''Ich habe genug''), Charles Wuorinen's ''New York Notes'' and the Schubert Octet. Mariusz Kwiecien is the baritone soloist in the Bach. Sunday at 5 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $92.  KOZINN    MUSICA SACRA If it's December, this must be ''Messiah.'' Richard Westenburg, Musica Sacra's music director, knows Handel's score as well as anyone, and some loyalists consider his annual performances, developed over four decades, the benchmark in the New York area. A performance a few years ago suggested that a certain routine may have taken hold, but the group should be on its mettle for its 40th-anniversary performance of the work. The vocal soloists are Rachel Rosales, Ryland Angel, James Archie Worley and Ryan McKinny. Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $20 to $110.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO The touring arm of the venerable Marlboro Music Festival makes regular appearances at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This weekend they come bearing arrangements of Bach's Trio Sonatas (BWV 529 and 530), Brahms's sumptuously voiced G-major string sextet, and a set of remarkable miniatures by the Hungarian composer Gyorgy Kurtag titled ''Signs, Games and Messages.'' The festival is known for its spirit of relaxed and spontaneous music-making, so one hopes the musicians will bring along a bit of that, too. Tonight at 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $35.  EICHLER    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC The mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson puts critics to the test because her great artistry is almost beyond description. It is hard to explain the effect of her richly colored and deeply expressive singing. For her New York Philharmonic debut, under the conductor Colin Davis, she sings Britten's dramatic cantata ''Phaedra,'' the composer's setting of Robert Lowell's translation of a Racine text, and an aria from Mozart's ''Clemenza di Tito.'' Sir Colin also conducts symphonies by Mozart (the ''Paris'') and Haydn (the ''Drumroll''), composers he has long conducted with elegance and vibrancy. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90.  TOMMASINI    * 'UNSILENT NIGHT' This holiday tradition is part of the season regardless of the holiday you happen to celebrate. Held every year since 1992, Phil Kline's seasonal piece encompasses anyone willing to show up at the starting point, carry a boombox and wander through the East Village as part of an informal blocklong parade that spreads music in its wake (and accommodates whatever reaction it may elicit along the way). Since its inception ''Unsilent Night'' has spread to other cities and even other countries: Middlesborough, England, had its own last weekend. Saturday at 6:45 p.m., meeting at the arch in Washington Square and ending in Tompkins Square Park. Free; bring a boombox if you have one, though Mr. Kline usually brings several dozen for the occasion.  ANNE MIDGETTE    VIENNA CHOIR BOYS As the old millennium begins to fade into memory, few musical institutions can claim to have made their mark on more than half of it. Here is one, founded in 1498, renewed ever since and looking to span a new millennium. Kerem Sezen conducts the group in a holiday program. Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $19 to $70.  OESTREICH    ANNE SOFIE VON OTTER She has done everything from ''Carmen'' to a recording with Elvis Costello; she has a great track record at finding interesting music that's fun; and she's versatile and popular enough to be an ideal choice for a holiday program with a certain je ne sais quoi. Or however you say that in Swedish, since Sweden is the home in this mezzo-soprano's ''Home for the Holidays'' program, for which she is bringing a small ensemble of musicians -- including an accordion and a guitar -- to Lincoln Center to play holiday favorites by everyone from Bach to Bohlin. Tomorrow night at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $50.

Full reviews of recent dance performances:  nytimes.com/dance.    ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER Smart, passionate and technically impressive, these Ailey dancers perform as if they believe in the power of communication. This weekend's highlights include the delectably sassy, bittersweet Ailey-Ellington ''Night Creature'' (tomorrow afternoon and evening), Ailey's impassioned ''Cry'' and the Donald McKayle classic ''Rainbow Round My Shoulder'' (both tomorrow night), and works by Ulysses Dove, Billy Wilson, Alonzo King and Ronald K. Brown. And Ailey's ''Revelations,'' of course, which ends the program tonight and the evening programs tomorrow and Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m. City Center, 131 West 55th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.alvinailey.org. Tickets: $25 to $110; $10 (cash only, at the box office) for Ailey DanceChance tickets on the day of performances Tuesday through Thursday nights and Sunday nights for students with identification). (Related review, Page 6.)  JENNIFER DUNNING    EGLEVSKY BALLET: 'THE NUTCRACKER' This production is a traditional one, choreographed by Ali Pourfarrokh, who directs the Eglevsky, Long Island's 43-year-old classical ballet troupe. Yes, there will be sugar plums, candy canes and dancing snowflakes, with not a finger-popping mouse in sight. Tomorrow at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.; Sunday at noon and 5 p.m. (and next Sunday at 2 p.m.), Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, C.W. Post Campus, Long Island University, Route 25A, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100. Tickets: $25 to $45; $22.50 to $40.50 for 65+.  DUNNING    YOSHIKO CHUMA: ''GAME/PLAY,'' Yoshiko Chuma has dancers and musicians from six countries play dozens of games ranging from innocent children's diversions to adult pastitmes like gambling. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, Upper East Side, (212 )517-2742. Tickets: $15.  JACK ANDERSON    MERCE CUNNINGHAM DANCE COMPANY The company creates theatrical kaleidoscopes in ''Events,'' performances in which new and existing choreography will be combined in a different way at each performance. And each performance will have different music and designs. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theatre, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $42.  ANDERSON    THE KITCHEN: DANCE IN PROGRESS Choreographers, most of them new or little known, get together in this annual workshop to develop dances that they then perform. This year's artists are Erin Cornell, who dances with Jennifer Lacey and has performed with witty types like Sara Rudner and Cathy Weis, and Morgan Thorson, a Minneapolis-based choreographer who has worked with Jennifer Monson. Complete the trio is My Name & Company/Kepple + Osorio, a cooperative devoted to multimedia and performance work. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, ext. 11. Tickets: $12.  DUNNING    BEN MUNISTERI DANCE PROJECTS The program includes sneak previews of work that will be performed next year at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival and Central Park SummerStage. One of the new dances is set to music by Evren Celimli. Tonight through Sunday night at 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    NEW YORK CITY BALLET ''The Nutcracker'' is here. What more can be said? The company is performing George Balanchine's magical production of Tchaikovsky's fairy-tale ballet, complete with lovely snowflakes and sugarplums and malicious marauding mice. There's lots of sumptuous spectacle and delicious dancing. Tonight Peter Boal makes his debut as Herr Drosselmeier (a role he will repeat for a second and last time this season on Dec. 21). Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $26 to $96.  ANDERSON    NOA DANCE AND DANSCORES Nelly van Brummel, from France, describes her work, performed by her Noa Dance, as mixing subtle restraint and physical exhaustion. Sharing the program is Ofelia Loret de Mola, from Mexico, whose Danscores troupe will perform movement derived from improvisation and nervous impulses rather than conscious effort. Tonight at 9; tomorrow at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (347) 628-2160. Tickets: $15; $12 for students with identification.  DUNNING    DAVID PARKER Mr. Parker and his Bang Group arrive just in time to cure those seasonal ''Nutcracker'' blues. Their ''Nut/cracked'' is a sly, smart reinvention of the 19th-century classic. Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow and Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Manhattan, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $25.  DUNNING    LIONEL POPKIN AND ANDY RUSS Mr. Popkin, a choreographer, and Mr. Russ collaborate on an evening of new works. Productions include a duet in which two people crawl over each other as they prepare a zucchini dish and a movement game for five people. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.  ANDERSON    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.  MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002 everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding its skin. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  HOLLAND COTTER    * MARK DION: 'RESCUE ARCHAEOLOGY, A PROJECT FOR THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART,' the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, through March 14. Mark Dion's installation piece is a site-specific faux archaeological-roots tour that resonates well with MoMA's historic reopening. Displaying detritus unearthed and salvaged during the renovation, it mixes bits and pieces of the Rockefeller brownstone that originally housed the museum on West 53rd Street with scraps of wallpaper from the recently demolished Dorset Hotel. The present's continual erasure of the past is poignantly illustrated, as is the rather startling contrast between the museum's modest beginnings with its current megacorporate dominance of the block. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m.  ROBERTA SMITH    * 'EAST VILLAGE USA,' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 219-1222 (through March 19). The roiling polymorphous East Village art scene of the 1980's comes to life in this fast-moving exhibition. Graffiti art, Neo-Expressionism, post-Conceptual political art and much more are touched on. The importance of punk, Warholian camp, hip-hop and longstanding local traditions of underground art and grass-roots activism is palpable in films, videos and photographs. And we are reminded that the scene was increasingly shadowed by the specter of AIDS and its own commercial success, which caused artists and dealers alike to decamp for SoHo. Also included is one great rediscovery, Frank Moore and Jim Self's 1985 film ''Beehive,'' a hilarious and beautiful ballet-in-an-installation. It shares a wall with a projection of Ethyl Eichelberger's 1986 ''Leer'' -- a revered one-man collision of Shakespeare and ''Gone With the Wind'' -- the high point of the show. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students and 65+  SMITH    * 'FORM FOLLOWS FASHION,' Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, (212) 217-7999, through Dec. 31. This ravishing show stresses fashion as a formal, abstract art, implicitly geometric, architectural, even in moments of excess. So it's not surprising in this context that formal also means evening wear, the genre in which garments are freed most decisively from function, or that couture gowns by designers from Charles James to Ralph Rucci enhanced by the invisible mannequins make this show a garden of unearthly capricious, silken delights. The art of the times is also startlingly palpable, notably in the pyramidal black-and-white gown that Michel Goma designed for Patou in the early 60's that is a near knockoff of a motif used by Myron Stout and Ellsworth Kelly. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, noon to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free.  SMITH    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. There are problems with the new Museum of Modern Art, starting with its egregious $20 ticket price. The fairly inchoate assemblage of paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films from the last 30 years in the suite of double-height galleries for contemporary art on the second floor spells trouble, too. MoMA clearly still has to deal with the conflict between its historic authority when it comes to art of the first 60 or so years of the 20th century and the indeterminacy of its taste in recent art. But the building is exquisite, a great gift to the city, and you would have to be comatose or completely immune to the pleasures of modernism not to be moved by its fifth floor, the start of the rooms for painting and sculpture. Here is the familiar, early story of modernism that MoMA virtually invented under its founding director and genius, Alfred H. Barr Jr., now retold in an installation that is about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. Hours and admission: see above.  KIMMELMAN    JENNIFER PASTOR: 'THE PERFECT RIDE,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (877) 944-8639, through Jan. 16. ''The Perfect Ride'' is a trio of works displayed in the Whitney's small first-floor gallery: a three-minute, slow-motion animated cartoon of a cowboy riding a bucking bull; a model of the human ear; and a large, semiabstract sculpture of aluminum and clear plastic that represents Hoover Dam. All involve the flow and circulation of energy, but beyond that it is hard to say what Ms. Pastor has in mind with this exceedingly cool and cerebral exhibition. Hours and admission: see above.  KEN JOHNSON    * 'PRINCELY SPLENDOR: THE DRESDEN COURT, 1580-1620,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 30. A densely baubled selection of some of the tools, armor, sculpture and bejeweled gewgaws that the princes of Dresden accumulated in the late-16th and early-17th centuries. Ignore the hackneyed and pompous exhibition title and consider this a constructive reminder of the artistic roots of wonderment. Besides ivory handled hammers, there is a portable hunting and writing desk. It is neatly stocked with gardening tools, writing and painting implements, cupping glasses, an oil cruet, soap boxes, scales, strainers, funnels, vintner tools, barber instruments, farrier tools, locksmith tools -- in sum, the world, as a mirror of divine reason, a cabinet of wonders, for princes who had everything. Hours: Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.  KIMMELMAN    * 'RETRATOS: 2,000 YEARS OF LATIN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, through March 20. Two millenniums is a lot of terrain for even a survey cover, and this one moves from pre-Columbian sculpture to contemporary painting. But what is in between is so interesting and so unfamiliar that the trip is a pleasure. Art from the Spanish and Portuguese colonial era makes up the bulk of the work. It starts with a 16th-century portrait of three dark-skinned men, descendants of Indians and African slaves, wearing European ruffed collars, silks and distinctly un-European gold lip-rings and nose plugs. It continues with images of bewigged colonial officials, flower-crowned nuns and everyday people. The artists, whether trained in Europe or the New World, are as amazing as the faces they paint. Hours: Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5, students and 65+; free for members; Thursdays free from 4 t 8 p.m.; 65+ free all day Thursdays.  COTTER    * 'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The symbols of wealth, status and sexuality run from the maximal white swan's-down coat, plucked from male swan breasts and owned by Marlene Dietrich, to the minimal bikini recently wrought of badger fur by Jordan Betten, a reprise of the next-to-nothing get-up that revealed most of Raquel Welch in the 1966 film ''One Million Years B.C.'' The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. Hmmm. Hours and admission: see above.  GRACE GLUECK    Galleries: Uptown    'ART IN A MIRROR: COUNTERPROOFS OF MARY CASSATT,' Adelson Galleries, 25 East 77th Street, (212) 439-6870, through Jan. 14. These recently discovered counterproofs would seem to be of more interest to Cassatt scholars than to the general public. Like some of her Impressionist colleagues, Cassatt (1844-1926) made them by the simple method of pressing a damp sheet of paper on the face of existing work -- here, pastels -- transferring a mirror image of the original, but faded and softened. The 48 shown, sweet portraits of mothers with infants, children alone or posing with pets, pale by comparison with the sharp chromatics of Cassatt's wonderful prints.  GLUECK    RICHARD PETTIBONE, Leo Castelli, 18 East 77th Street, (212) 249-4470, through Thursday. Mr. Pettibone has forged a career by copying in miniature and with tenderly fastidious craft what other, more famous artists have done. This exhibition of paintings from 1964 to the present features hand-painted reproductions of Duchamp's ''Marie,'' Frank Stella's black pinstripe paintings and Roy Lichtenstein's image of a burning cigarette. There are surprises, too, like the baseball-card size, Photorealist portrait of Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.  JOHNSON    Galleries: 57th Street    * BILL BRANDT: 'THE NUDE: A CENTENARY EXHIBITION,' Edwynn Houk Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 750-7070, through Jan. 8. Though he earned enormous respect as a photojournalist, making memorable studies of British life and class contrasts among other achievements, Brandt (1904-1983) liked to say that his photographs of nudes were the works by which he wanted to be remembered. This show pays tribute to his quirky, not conventionally erotic nude images from the early post-World War II days in which he photographed them melodramatically in dark, sparsely furnished interiors to later 1950's studies that were near abstractions. In these he closed in on parts, distorted or exaggerated by odd angles of focus and perspective and lighted for sharp contrasts of black and white. They often took on a surreally sensuous quality remote from everyday.  GLUECK    YOAN CAPOTE: 'ANIMICA,' George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 644-5665, through Dec. 30. Works by this Havana-based Surrealist include a suitcase containing a brick wall; a stack of concrete blocks separated by rows of clenched, polished bronze teeth called ''Stress''; a faux-classical Greek male torso with a brain replacing its genitalia; and real leather shoes that have weirdly merged at the toes.  JOHNSON    JULIO LARRAZ, Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900, through Jan. 8. Mr. Larraz, who came to the United States from Cuba as a teenager in 1961, produces a generously painterly realism that often veers into surrealistic fantasy. His canvases record scenes of ordinary beauty, like the images of a melting block of ice or potted bougainvilleas for sale on a sunlighted boat deck. Then there is Vincent van Gogh visiting a modern aquarium in which a big shark hovers behind the thick glass.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    'EMOTICONS,' Guild & Greyshkul, 22 Wooster Street, (212) 625-9224, through Dec. 18. Referring to the shorthand symbols of feelings used by those adept at e-mail and text messaging, this title is somehow appropriate for this coolly elegant exhibition of two- and three-dimensional works by Dike Blaire, Jay Heikes, Jon Kessler, Julian Opie, Danica Phelps and seven others selected by Kevin Zucker. Carol Bove's record of a reading of ''The Future of Ecstasy,'' an essay by Allan Watts, is worth a listen for its fascinating recollection of 60's-style utopian psychology.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    LINDA BESEMER, Cohan and Leslie, 138 10th Avenue, at 18th Street, (212) 206-8710, through next Friday. Ms. Besemer's colorfully striped and gridded paintings consist of nothing but acrylic paint. Typically she has draped her smooth, rubbery sheets of paint over custom-made metal dowels, displaying them like bath mats at Ikea, but only one of her new works is on a rack. The others are attached flat to the wall, the better to show off visually ravishing layered grids distorted by illusionistic bulges.  JOHNSON    ODILI DONALD ODITA: 'NOTES FROM PARADISE,' Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Dec. 31. The Nigerian-born, Tallahassee-based Mr. Odita paints hard-edged, gridded, beautifully color-coordinated abstractions with intimations of landscape and African textile design. They are a pleasure to view, and the wedding of Modernism and traditionalism is something to ponder.  JOHNSON    ANDERS PETERSEN, Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-3363, through Dec. 31. Gritty, bleak and often darkly humorous black-and-white photographs by this Swedish photographer variously call to mind Robert Frank, Diane Arbus and Nan Goldin, but Mr. Petersen's work has its own raw pungency. This exhibition includes a series from 1978 documenting social life in a grungy bar; a series from 1995 shot in a psychiatric clinic; and recent diaristic works, often blurred and shot at oblique angles, recording what seems a life of volatile moodiness.  JOHNSON    JOEL-PETER WITKIN: 'HEART BEATS DUST,' Ricco-Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819, through Dec. 31. This pioneer of high-art, gross-out, postmodernist photography continues to produce faux-antique pictures of amputees, hermaphrodites, severed body parts and absurdly overwrought erotic tableaus. He has also ventured, unconvincingly, into Surrealistic collage, and he has applied paint by hand to some of his prints. A good title for this exhibition would be ''Lost in Transition.''  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    'FIGHT OR FLIGHT,' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, (917) 663-2453. Through Feb. 18. Six artists were asked to make works about fear and anxiety. Excepting Rico Gatson's kaleidoscopic video punctuated by exploding bombs, none directly address war or terrorism. Amy Gartrell's psychedelic felt banners spoof self-affirmation mantras; Kristin Baker's semiabstract paintings evoke car crashes; and Marc Swanson's ship mast with a square sail of stitched-together T-shirts encourages a spirit of adventure. Little carnivorous horses graze on the flesh of a fallen dragon in Ivan Witenstein's large fantasy sculpture; and an installation by Wangechi Mutu stages a surrealistic shootout.  JOHNSON    'IN THIS PLACE,' Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-0473, through Jan. 22. This exhibition of photographs and videos by 15 artists includes works that evoke specific places, like Claudio Nolasco's street-level views of Williamsburg and Francesca Romeo's powerful video record of life in a Lower East Side bar. But too many others look like they could have been made just about anywhere -- Clifford Owens's sadomasochistic video performance piece set in an empty studio, for example -- and that undermines the thesis of the show's curator, Allen Frame.  JOHNSON    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE,' City Hall Park, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 14. Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style by this British artist include cartoon fashion models painted on freestanding sheets of glass; life-size enamel-on-steel representations of new cars; a quartet of playhouse-scale, 19th-century-style buildings of painted plywood entitled ''Village?''; and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows.  JOHNSON    Last Chance    'CAST AND CARVED: AMERICAN SCULPTURE, 1850-1950,' Gerald Peters Gallery, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760, closing today. A century's worth of American sculpture, five tons of it, has been shoehorned into this town-house gallery, forming a wonderful mix of styles and movements whose examples range from first- to third-rate. Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Elie Nadelman, Alexander Calder and Isamu Noguchi are some of the starrier names. A browser's joy, the show offers a fine range of contrasts and comparisons as well as pure appreciations and a few surprises. For Western buffs, there's even a roomful of dashing bronzes by Frederic Remington, Charles Schreyvogel and James Earl Fraser.  GLUECK    GILBERT & GEORGE: 'PERVERSIVE PICTURES,' Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-1018, and Lehmann Maupin, 540 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-2923., closing tomorrow. The British artists Gilbert and George have been such bad boys for such a long time that you figure they will eventually run out of steam. But they haven't yet on the evidence of a gratifyingly high-pitched two-gallery show that is set at just the right eye-splitting volume for a suddenly becalmed political atmosphere. The three-dozen new pieces spread over two galleries are digitally souped-up versions of the artists' customary multipanel photographic format.  COTTER    * 'NEUE SACHLICHKEIT: NEW OBJECTIVITY IN WEIMAR GERMANY,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, closing tomorrow. Heralded by the Expressionist Ludwig Meidner as a ''fanatical, fervent naturalism,'' the ostensibly realist style known as Neue Sachlichkeit was all that and more, as this uneven 80-work show vigorously suggests. It features the majestically factual photographs of August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt and Albert Renger-Patzsch, and works based on photographs by Georg Scholz, Eddy Smith and George Grosz that bring out reality's grotesque side.  SMITH    SHI CHONG: 'RADICAL REALISM,' Ethan Cohen, 37 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250, through Tuesday. Said to be one of China's leading Realist painters, Mr. Shi here presents two approaches to the female nude. Photorealist paintings of models who have been slathered in paste and have objects attached to them look so much like big photographs it is hard to believe they are handmade. Other paintings, apparently done from direct observation and made with a tender, slightly brushy touch, read as empathic meditations on the mortality of the flesh.  JOHNSON    LORI TASCHLER, JG Contemporary, 505 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 564-7662, closing tomorrow. Ms. Taschler's mysterious, sweetly melancholic paintings and pastels feature singular, emblematic objects or scenes: a simple house flanked by bare trees; an oven with its door invitingly open; a suspension bridge; a person sleeping with a cat on a sofa. Painted with faux-naïve simplicity and soft edges in shades of one or two muted colors, the images seem to emerge from dreams or transcendentalist reveries.  JOHNSON    '3 ATTEMPTS AT LONGEVITY,' Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, (212) 865-0783, closing on Sunday. ''Longevity'' here means extension not in time but in space. Each of three sculptors has created a work that is, like the gallery, 80-feet long. Karyn Olivier has piled all her winter clothes in the middle of a steel cable strung from one wall to the other; George Raggett has erected an orange plastic-and-metal construction fencing with sandbags, candles and little American flags near the middle commenting on contemporary desert warfare; and Isabel Riley has installed a series of colorful suspended yarn works and wooden structures resembling looms.

Even the crème de la crème can curdle every now and then. This musical adaptation of Aristophanes' 2,400-year-old comedy of gods and playwrights has the highest concentration of blue-ribbon talent of any show now on Broadway. It stars Nathan Lane, the only actor who qualifies as serious royalty in the thinning world of musical comedy, and Roger Bart, whose very smile has been known to stop a show. The director and choreographer is Susan Stroman (''The Producers,'' ''Contact''). And the composer is -- reverent pause, please -- Stephen Sondheim. Yet despite these fine ingredients, what should have been a zesty, airy soufflé is a soggy, lumpy batter that never shows the slightest signs of rising. Staged in 1974 as a publicity-garnering, hourlong novelty by the Yale School of Drama -- around and in the university gymnasium swimming pool, if you please -- this bauble of a show has been reshaped to fill two and a half hours. The results suggest that to stretch something this slight is to shatter it (2:30). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $65 to $95 (Brantley).    *+ ''I AM MY OWN WIFE'' (Tony winner for best play and best actor in a play). Doug Wright's one-actor play, with a thrillingly accomplished performance by Jefferson Mays and a diamond-sharp production directed by Moisés Kaufman, tells a terrific story based on a real person, Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (né Lothar Berfelde), a soft-spoken but tenaciously gender-bending biological man who died in 2002 at 74. Her lifelong obsession -- Mahlsdorf preferred to be thought of as female -- was the preservation of furniture, especially from the 1890's, and other household relics like Victrolas and gramophones. Her devotion to her astonishing collection, with which she turned her home into a museum, gave focus and motivation to a life whose grandest achievement was that it proceeded to its natural end. The play is largely about Charlotte's enduring the cruel repressions of the Nazis and the Communists, and her harrowing tales of survival through the eras of the Gestapo and the Stasi are nothing short of breathtaking. Ah, but are they credible? That also becomes an issue in the play, which very subtly but, in the end, quite powerfully makes a case for the necessity of storytelling in our lives (2:15). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $86.25, with $20 student and teacher tickets at the box office the day of show (Bruce Weber).    Off Broadway    ''THE BALD SOPRANO'' AND ''THE LESSON.'' Works of art have a way of regaining currency as the years pass. The Romanian-born Eugène Ionesco, writing in 1950, surely did not envision the 21st-century American political landscape, but his ''Bald Soprano,'' a dark comedy about the vacuity of language, seems eerily apposite today. This is true despite the flaws in Carl Forsman's production, which domesticates and slightly sentimentalizes Ionesco's corrosive vision, generating plenty of silly humor but failing to penetrate to the play's icy core. In ''The Lesson,'' the problem doesn't arise, since this more macabre comedy is clear-cut, at least in its emotional dynamics. It, too, could easily be seen by the politically minded as a grim cautionary tale for today. Beneath the play's preposterous comic surfaces, Ionesco makes unsettling connections between the corruption of means of communication and the unleashing of man's basest, most violent instincts; he seems to suggest that the destruction of language leads inexorably to the destruction of life. The new translations by Tina Howe are clever, crisp and generally similar to previous versions (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Charles Isherwood).    *+ ''GUANTÁNAMO: 'HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM.' '' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: You are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. First produced in London by the Tricycle Theater, this calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge. Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon, for two performances only, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner, is to portray a British magistrate who objects to the detentions (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60 (Brantley).    * ''HEDDA GABLER.'' Ivo van Hove's strange, and strangely enthralling, new production of Ibsen's much-mounted drama about a dangerously frustrated housewife may not necessarily illuminate the play as a dramatic text. His sights are set considerably higher: he is an artist seeking, as Ibsen once did, to illuminate the world around him. The set, designed by his longtime collaborator Jan Versweyveld, is not a reasonable representation of the handsome, expensively appointed home spoken of more than once in the course of the play; the empty, echoing space represents an interior landscape, the cold, underpopulated expanses of Hedda's mind. In a performance that is a major achievement for this adventurous actress, Elizabeth Marvel evokes this process with captivating clarity, tracing the disjointed trajectory of an intellect devouring itself. The rest of the cast is also superb (2:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65 (Isherwood).    * ''MRS. FARNSWORTH.'' Political candidates poised to sling mud might take a pointer from A. R. Gurney: good manners can be lethal weapons. ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' is as polite and sweetly subversive a political attack as you're likely to come across. Set in a creative writing classroom (with the excellent Danny Burstein as the teacher), the play unfolds around its title character's desire to write a novel about her youthful involvement with a man who sounds awfully like George W. Bush. Sigourney Weaver, returning to the role she created last spring, deploys annihilating charm as a wealthy high-WASP wife; Gerry Bamman, as her husband, completes the cast. ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' directed by Jim Simpson, is a polemical exercise that never screams at you. Instead, it feels as if it is spoken out of the side of the mouth -- sotto voce and through a locked jaw. This turns out be a thoroughly disarming technique (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, (212) 352-3101. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $60 (Brantley).    + ''ROSE RAGE.'' This is not, as you might imagine, a comedy about dueling florists. It's a hefty slab of Shakespeare: all three parts of ''Henry VI,'' trimmed of fat and put through a meat grinder, then garnished with generous doses of directorial panache. A freshly sharpened cleaver is the weapon of choice in Edward Hall's flashy, eminently accessible production, which presents 15th-century England as a slaughterhouse doing big business. The three plays are compressed into less than four hours of stage time. (With a generous dinner break and two intermissions, ''Rose Rage'' requires about five and a half hours.) The overriding metaphor, equating war with butchery, is manifested in various arresting ways. A cleaver snaps down on a jiggling pile of organ meat, signifying the fated end of an earl. Globs of flesh drip from plastic bags flung up on meat hooks. Red cabbages, symbolizing traitorous heads, are splintered beneath wooden clubs. But metaphors are by their nature limiting, and Mr. Hall's has worn a bit thin by the end of the long evening. More problematic: Characters emerge only in broad outline here, and a real sense of humanity is largely missing from the production (5:30). The Duke on 42nd Street Theater, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 6 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $75 (Isherwood).    + ''SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW.'' A giggle of clowns led by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. And so it is, as Mr. Polunin, with his baggy yellow romperlike costume, his red ball of a nose, his tufts of white hair and his shaggy red bulbous shoes, teams with his cutup colleagues. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title, propelled with blizzard force in a dramatic finale (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90 (Lawrence Van Gelder).    Last Chance    + ''HERE LIES JENNY.'' Conceived and staged by Roger Rees, with musical direction by Leslie Stifelman and choreography by Ann Reinking, this cigarillo-slender show weaves songs by Kurt Weill into a vague narrative cycle about the life and times of one weary woman. Her name is Jenny, and it seems fitting that she should be portrayed by Bebe Neuwirth, who won Tony Awards playing hard-bitten gals from the shady side of the street in ''Sweet Charity'' and ''Chicago.'' But don't expect lurid thrills. The mood is more pensive than prurient, with Ms. Neuwirth's character presented as a soft, battered, sentimental creature, like a ragdoll that has been played with too hard. ''Here Lies Jenny'' is not the sort of show to kick you into gear for a long night on the town. It's more like a reassuring lullaby, which progresses from brooding nostalgia to hope for the morning to come (1:15). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 5 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 7 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $60 (Brantley).    ++ ''THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS -- THE MUSICAL!'' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater, and parody is the best kind of narcissism. So many of today's musicals strut fancy sets and special effects. A good parody needs smart writers and winning performers; ''The Musical of Musicals -- The Musical!,'' a York Theater production, has four, and two are the composer Eric Rockwell and the lyricist Joanne Bogart. Taking their plot straight from corny old melodrama, they spoof the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Kander and Ebb. The Jerry Herman segment is the weakest because his work is the simplest; the pretensions of Lord Lloyd Webber make a better target. The other three are good, zany fun. They have the joie de vivre we want from a musical (1:40). The Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Margo Jefferson).

Broadway    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Is there room on Broadway for another odd couple of singing con men? On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' directed by Jack O'Brien and starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a queasy slouch. Though shot through a rowdy spirit of self-parody, the show (with songs by David Yazbek) seems to believe in its own brazen agenda only when the criminally talented Mr. Butz commands the stage.

BEN BRANTLEY    +'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' Memory, which is notorious for playing tricks on people, pulls off some doozies in this narcoticized production of Tennessee Williams's classic drama. Staged by David Leveaux, this revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea through which people swim slowly and blindly. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange, who brings a sleepy, neurotic sensuality to the role of the vital and domineering Amanda Wingfield, and Christian Slater, who is a red-hot firebrand as her poetical son, Tom (2:30).

BRANTLEY    *'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people (including the cast) that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience among school-age children and grown-ups in touch with the nerdy, nose-thumbing 12-year-olds within. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a cast that includes Tim Curry, David Hyde Pierce, Hank Azaria and the toothsome scenery chewer Sara Ramirez (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $101.25. BRANTLEY    +*'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, directed by Anthony Page and starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners. Tempering the play's notorious vitriol with eye-opening compassion, this interpretation restores characters who have acquired the faces of Freudian monsters to purely human form. In following Mr. Albee's account of a couple's long-night's journey into dawn, Mr. Page and company affectingly scale a masterpiece back from operatic excess to the tautness of a chamber work (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $91.25. BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    +'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion. Staking no claim to artistic significance, it makes a nice sound, looks pretty (if you like pretty boys) and sends you home with a smile. The show comprises a dozen sly parodies cooked up by the skilled songwriters Gary Adler and Michael Patrick Walker, with winking choruses like, ''Girl, you make me want to wait.'' All the guys have terrific voices and nimble limbs, and each gets a moment to linger in the solo spotlight. (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200.

CHARLES ISHERWOOD    ++'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their steadfast belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause. An earnest, inert musical about the unlikely friendship forged between a white woman and an escaped slave in the South in the 1840's, it's a long, dreary sermon in song. Individual songs are affecting, and director-choreographer Graciela Daniele stages some numbers effectively, but the scope of the musical is too broad, and its tone is too pedagogical, for even the two central characters to detach themselves from the burden of the narrative and establish their true humanity (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $75. ISHERWOOD    *'HOUSE/LIGHTS' The Wooster Group made the right choice when it selected ''House/Lights'' to embody its three decades of work. This technically dazzling production, based on a Gertrude Stein libretto, uses simulcast video monitors and voice-layering synthesizers to spin everything that is said and done into an orbit of multiple effects. The effect is as exhilarating as it is disorienting, capturing the impact of technology-driven life in a way that flat film and computer imagery never can. The subject may be dehumanization, but the cast is among the most vital and theatrically disciplined you will ever see. (1:10) St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718)254-8779. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m. Tickets: $30 on Wednesdays and Thursdays; $37 Fridays through Sundays. BRANTLEY    +'INKY' Beware the nanny with bruised knuckles. That's the only cogent conclusion to draw from Rinne Groff's peculiar and unfocused comedy about the competitive ethics of the 1980's. The title is the odd nickname for the odd main character, a Manhattan au pair obsessed with Muhammad Ali. Inky is played by a talented newcomer to the New York stage, Jessi Campbell. The play traces her influence on her employers, a harried young businessman and his demanding wife. Unfortunately, Ms. Groff is too vague in her use of boxing symbolism, and too loose in her observation of character, for her ideas about the aridity of the rat race to hit home (1:20). Women's Project, at the Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $47. ISHERWOOD    'THE LAST DAYS OF JUDAS ISCARIOT' This latest work from the author of ''Jesus Hopped the A Train'' brings to mind an unusually lively senior-class project. Thank heaven -- a subject much discussed in this debate of a drama about the Bible's most famous betrayal -- that at least the person in charge is the class cutup. And that he is popular enough to recruit some really cool friends (including Eric Bogosian, Sam Rockwell and the show's director, Philip Seymour Hoffman). Still, the colorful vernacular speech and flashy performances can't disguise the impression that the play is a heavily footnoted position paper on a big, big subject (2:40) . Public Theater/Martinson Hall, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50. BRANTLEY    + 'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: Things will look a lot more impressive than they actually are if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind ''Lazer Vaudeville,'' a show with lots of color, not much substance and a future asterisk: it is the last production in the John Houseman Theater, slated for demolition. The show is a hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by Carter Brown, Cindy Marvell and Nicholas Flair, who are moderately engaging but don't seem to be having quite enough fun. Ms. Marvell is a first-class juggler and never disappoints, and there's a funny little hat fandango involving all three, but some of the men's bits and ensemble pieces don't have much wow factor Perhaps the three know they are short on razzmatazz, because they constantly shut off the lights and let their glow-in-the-dark ropes and batons do the talking (1:30). John Houseman Theater, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Mondays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 11 a.m., 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $45. NEIL GENZLINGER    'MONK' Rome Neal eases his way through this solo play about the jazz musician Thelonious Monk, taking his time to tell the story of an artist he clearly loves. Mr. Neal drops a few names and recounts career high and low-lights. He even pauses to dance during musical interludes, composed by Bill Lee. Laurence Holder's workmanlike script fits Mr. Neal like a glove. It's full of laid-back lines like ''trial and error, baby, that's my school'' or ''you dig, well, I dug.'' However, this is not the show for jazz fans that want to delve deep into Monk's psychology or learn something new about his process. It's like a pleasant evening with an old friend, not an emotional ride. In one telling moment, Monk says: ''I'm enigmatic. I'm weird. I'm me'' (1:30). Abingdon Theater Compalex, June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-2055. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45. JASON ZINOMAN    ++'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater. It is always paying homage to itself. Parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs is smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in the case of ''The Musical of Musicals!'' Two of the performers are also the creators: Joanne Bogart (lyrics) and Eric Rockwell (music). Aided by Lovette George and Craig Fols, they offer spoofs in the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Kander and Ebb. (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 5oth Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $56 to $59.50. MARGO JEFFERSON    'ON SECOND AVENUE' Can a perfectly calibrated ensemble production also be a star vehicle? Apparently so, because that's what this Folksbiene Yiddish Theater's revival is. Six appealing performers with six fine voices share roughly equal time delivering songs and shtick from the heyday of Yiddish theater, yet the show's biggest name, the American/Israeli actor Mike Burstyn, shines all that much brighter in his solo moments. This zippy revue, first seen in the 1980's, has aphorisms (''He who digs a grave for others will himself fall in'') and sassy couplets and lots and lots of songs. ''In the theater, we saw ourselves,'' Mr. Burstyn summarizes in one interlude, and the music covers the spectrum of human emotions: love, regret, envy, self-parody. Some of the material is delivered in Yiddish, with supertitles provided, though they're hardly worth the trouble: the performers convey all the meaning that's needed. English, though, takes over for a priceless barrage of jokes delivered vaudeville-style by Mr. Burstyn. ''Two Jewish cannibals,'' he begins, but the rest won't be spoiled here (2:00) . JCC in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, (212)213-2120. Wednesdays and Thursdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 6 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $45. GENZLINGER    +*''S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success. Mr. Pendleton, an actor and acting teacher, reimagines this theatrical footnote as a quietly momentous turning point in the emotional and professional lives of everyone involved, including Olivier's outgoing and incoming wives, Vivien Leigh and Joan Plowright, and the critic Kenneth Tynan. While Mr. Pendleton smartly exploits the frailties of these graying artistic lions for comedy, there is an abiding respect and affection in his irreverence and in the fastidious performances of director David Cromer's fine cast (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: 55. ISHERWOOD    *'PLAY WITHOUT WORDS' The erotic possibilities multiply before your eyes in Matthew Bourne's frisky homage to London in the Swinging 60's. The square root of this witty dance play is unquestionably the pas de deux, but the math gets tricky when you consider that each of the five main characters is played by two or three performers, who often share the stage and sometimes move in tandem. Mr. Bourne has transformed a touchstone movie of the 1960s, Joseph Losey's macabre study in power games, ''The Servant,'' into a swirling stage play rewritten in suggestive shrugs, tangled limbs and smoldering glances. It's fresh, inventive and very sexy (1:45). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 7:30; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $75. ISHERWOOD    'ROMANCE' Listen up, you mugs. Nobody makes fun of David Mamet, see, because David Mamet can take care of that all by hisself. In the latest work from this most imitated and parodied of living American playwrights, Mr. Mamet knocks the four-letter stuffing out of his own staccato style. He then proceeds to beat up on the courtoom drama, the classic farce, ethnic and sexual stereotypes and his audience. It's a take-no-prisoners approach that, unfortunately, doesn't take any laughs either. Neil Pepe directs an irreproachable but ineffective cast that includes Larry Bryggman and Bob Balaban (1:35). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55. BRANTLEY    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. This monologue, which runs just over an hour and requires minimal stagecraft, is as unassuming in its means as it is astonishing in its impact. It's one of those treasured nights in the theater -- treasured nights anywhere, for that matter -- that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Mr. Eno and his performer, the actor James Urbaniak, reinvent that seemingly moribund theatrical genre, the solo show. They are immeasurably aided by the work of the director Hal Brooks. Mr. Eno's voice, or the voice of the narrator/protagonist/master of ceremonies played by Mr. Urbaniak, is alternately lyrical and affectless, ecstatic and flat, sardonic and sincere. It reflects precisely in its disorienting rhythms and colors the range of perceptions embedded in the monologue. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative: Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets; $45. ISHERWOOD    +'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson and directed by Casey Childs, the play is gaudy and moderately fun, basically a big chunk of theatrical costume jewelry. It concentrates, as these borderline morbid celebrity showcases often do, on the declining arc of its subject's worldly career, and gives us the usual generous doses of dysfunction and despair beneath the glittering resume. Ms. Ruehl gives a vigorous, enjoyably big performance, but even her hard work can't inflate the flatter stretches in the writing (1:40). Promenade Theater, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25. ISHERWOOD    Off Off Broadway    'PENTECOST' The Barrow Group's inaugural production in its new theater couldn't be much more ambitious: the New York premiere of ''Pentecost,'' a 1994 drama by the British playwright David Edgar. Written in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the play tackles everything from the origin of Western Renaissance art to America's pop-cultural hegemony to hostage negotiations. The writing is engaging and the staging keeps things moving. It's too bad, though, that Mr. Edgar didn't just stick with revolutionizing art history rather than trying to revolutionize the world (2:45). Barrow Group Arts Center, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Mondays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $40. PHOEBE HOBAN    Last Chance    'BROOKLYN BOY' One of the mortifications of middle age is being forced to admit the truth in those extra-mossy clichés that you mock when you are young and arrogant. The past always catches up with you; blood is thicker than water; be careful what you wish for. These are among the stale-but-true bromides that are acknowledged by the title character in Donald Margulies's sincere but doggedly unsurprising new play about the midlife crisis of a suddenly successful novelist (Adam Arkin). While this comic drama is steeped in an admirably humble and often touching spirit of acceptance, it seldom does what Mr. Margulies has achieved repeatedly before: make the familiar seem fresh. Polly Draper and Ari Graynor stand out in an excellent cast, smoothly directed by Daniel Sullivan (2:20). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $26 to $79. BRANTLEY    'GHETTO SUPERSTAR (THE MAN THAT I AM)' Midway through this musical autobiography, Billy Porter describes the moment that changed his life: His teenage encounter, via the Tony Awards telecast, with Jennifer Holliday's galvanizing performance of ''And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going.'' Those emotions play roles in this unabashedly sentimental show, but they ultimately take a back seat to righteous flamboyance. The hallmarks of Mr. Porter's personal history will not be revelations to theatergoers who have accompanied other gay men in the performing arts on similar journeys through shame and confusion to self-acceptance. But Mr. Porter's performance of various pop songs, show tunes and original compositions is vibrant and enjoyable. (1:40). Public Theater, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 7; tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at 9:30 p.m. Tickets: $45. ISHERWOOD    'GORILLA MAN' The usual afflictions befalling teenage boys -- acne, scuffed skateboards, the indifference of that girl in homeroom -- pale in comparison to the plight of Billy, the hero of this pop musical by Kyle Jarrow. Billy wakes one morning to find he is turning into a man-eating beast. Lonely and confused, he sets out to find the father who bequeathed him the genes that brought on this misfortune. On a deeper level, he seeks an answer to the profound question that has stumped philosophers, theologians and adolescents for at least a couple of millennia: ''Why me?'' There are many laughs in Mr. Jarrow's self-consciously silly book and well-tailored pop-rock songs, but the show's overall conception, which layers horror-movie melodramatics over a pseudo-earnest inquiry into questions of fate and free will, is ultimately juvenile (1:20). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 p.m.; Sunday at 6 p.m. Tickets: $15. ISHERWOOD    +'I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE' The prolific British novelist J.B. Priestley was fascinated by the concept of time, and his play suggests that individuals repeat their life cycles until they break free from past mistakes. Based partly on the author's readings of the Russian philosopher P.D. Ouspensky, the theory is described in the play by the mysterious German émigré Dr. Görtler. Dr. Görtler, like the five other characters at the Black Bull Inn on the moors of North Yorkshire in 1937, is a mechanical device for the working out of the Priestley-Ouspensky puzzle. And as demonstrated by the Pearl Theater Company cast, in what the troupe says is the first revival of the play in New York since it appeared on Broadway in 1938, where it flopped, there isn't much wiggle room when you are a device instead of a character. Symbolism aside, the pleasure of the evening is in watching the players move about with easy familiarity (all have worked together before at the Pearl), under Gus Kaikkonen's direction, on the snug, rose-colored set by Takeshi Kata with its four clocks that tick and chime at melodramatic moments. (2:30) Pearl Theater Company, Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 and $50. ANDREA STEVENS    'PULLMAN, WA' This new avant-garde work by Young Jean Lee has the deadpan simplicity of the plays of Richard Maxwell and the awkward, secretly suffering angst of a teenage diarist working through an identity crisis. Artifice is the enemy. There are no props or set (outside of two chairs); the lights never change; and the costumes look like the clothes that the actors might have worn to the movies earlier in the day. The play begins when Pete Simpson, a dead-eyed and strangely hypnotic actor, walks onstage and tells the audience that he know how to live. Don't get your hopes up. The entire play could be seen as a send-up of the self-help industry, a dry comment on its tough love and easy answers. It will surely not win over many who are already skeptical about experimental theater. But while this is not a major work, it is an honest one that takes itself seriously -- and that is refreshing (1:00) . Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288. Tonight and tomorrow at 7 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m. Tickets: $15. ZINOMAN    'SHYLOCK' Deconstructing Shakespeare is a dangerous sport; it's impossible to be more imaginative or clever than the playwright himself, even if you are Harold Bloom. Gareth Armstrong gives it a game try, but ''Shylock,'' his 80-minute dissertation on the evolution of one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters, although deftly performed, is no exception. While his pocket synopses of anti-Semitism, Elizabethan England, Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' and even a Baedeker of famous actors' renditions of Shylock are edifying, they are not sufficiently enlightening or entertaining. The most riveting lines of Mr. Armstrong's monologue belong to Shakespeare himself (1:35). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55; a limited number of $20 student/senior rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'BE COOL' Directed by F. Gary Gray. Starring John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Christina Milian (PG-13, 112 minutes). In ''Be Cool,'' Mr. Travolta, wearing black and the glazed look of the overly pampered and chronically bored, returns as Chili Palmer, the reformed mobster he first played in Barry Sonnenfeld's 1995 adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel ''Get Shorty.'' That movie arrived hot on the heels of ''Pulp Fiction,'' which in turn owed a serviceable debt to Mr. Leonard's oeuvre. But while ''Get Shorty'' rode the ''Pulp Fiction'' craze with finesse, largely propelled by Mr. Travolta's star presence and a screenplay from Scott Frank, ''Be Cool'' is running on empty, fueled by nothing more than the faintest of vapors left over from those earlier successes. The new film was written by Peter Steinfeld, whose draggy, generally unfunny screenplay packs in a lot of the same characters from the Leonard novel (the sequel to ''Get Shorty'') and too much of its overworked, conceptually anemic plot. MANOHLA DARGIS    'CONSTANTINE' Starring Keanu Reeves. Directed by Francis Lawrence (R, 122 minutes). Hell's bells! Sprung from the Matrix, Mr. Reeves glowers his way through another effect-heavy, convoluted journey between worlds, in this case defined by theology rather than technology. He is John Constantine, who travels back and forth between our world and the one below, working as a kind of freelance border guard, sending stray demons back into the fiery depths. But something big is brewing, involving rebel angels, the son of Satan, and a whole lot of pseudo-biblical mumbo jumbo. Assisting Mr. Reeves are Rachel Weisz, as a Los Angeles police detective whose sister has jumped off a roof, and Shia LeBoeuf as an eager dabbler in the occult. Tilda Swinton is the angel Gabriel, doing a bit of slumming after boffo work in Milton's ''Paradise Lost.'' A.O. SCOTT    'DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN' Starring Kimberly Elise, Tyler Perry and Cicely Tyson. Directed by Darren Grant. (PG-13, 116 minutes). This movie is so oblivious to genre that it occupies its own special stylistic niche, if you can imagine such a thing as a romantic revenge farce. As the story of a cruelly abandoned wife's reascendance zigzags from soap opera to slapstick to church sermon and back, it goes from A to Z on the all-things-to-all-people meter: Cinderella meets Amos 'n' Andy in Sunday school, so to speak. STEPHEN HOLDEN    'DOWNFALL' Starring Bruno Ganz. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. (No rating, 155 minutes; in German, with English subtitles). Mr. Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses around him, and the Red Army closes in. Surrounding him are his followers, some fanatically loyal, others wavering in the face of defeat, who must all play out the endgame of their ghastly world-historical project. Mr. Hirschsbiegel's film, taking place at the moment when the energies of Nazism turned from murder to suicide, is engrossing and well made, but it does not generate much feeling beyond a queasy, prurient fascination. Its most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it. SCOTT    *'GUNNER PALACE' Directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein. (PG-13, 86 minutes). Mr. Tucker spent several months in late 2003 and early 2004 in Baghdad recording the lives and words of members of the Army's 2/3 Field Artillery division (known as the Gunners), who were living in an opulent, bomb-damaged palace that once belonged to Uday Hussein. The resulting film is raw, powerful and confusing -- less a polished documentary than a living, unfinished document of a complicated war and the complicated young men who are fighting it. We accompany them on raids and patrols, witness their moments of leisure, and hear their own conflicted responses to their experiences, conveyed through jokes, video diaries, poems and hip-hop freestyling. Whatever your opinions of the war in Iraq, this film will provide a necessary jolt of confusion, which is the first step toward an unsentimental understanding of who the American troops are and what they face. SCOTT    'HOSTAGE' Directed by Florent Siri. Starring Bruce Willis and Kevin Pollak (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Mr. Willis's fading career as an action hero. The star plays a former hostage negotiator who has exiled himself to a quiet southern California town after a botched standoff. He springs back into action when the cliff-hugging mansion of a crooked book-cooking corporate accountant (Mr. Pollak) is simultaneously invaded by a posse of teenage punks and by a S.W.A.T. team of high-tech gangsters. The fiery demolition of this architectural monstrosity in which the accountant lives with his two children is the only thing worth applauding in this mess of film. HOLDEN    'IN MY COUNTRY' Directed by John Boorman. Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Juliette Binoche (R, 104 minutes). Ms. Binoche, playing a South African poet and reporter, is the weepy hand-wringing conscience of the high-minded but hopelessly wooden film that examines the public hearings conducted by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission in the late 1990's. At the hearings, victims of human rights abuse during Apartheid confronted the perpetrators in court, both sides seeking ''ubuntu,'' or forgiveness instead of revenge. Mr. Jackson is an American reporter who brings his own angry racial agenda to the hearings. The screenplay, by Ann Peacock, who adapted the story from Antjie Krog's memoir, ''Country of My Skull,'' makes the fatal mistake of turning characters into mouthpieces engaged in stiff, point-counterpoint moral debate. HOLDEN    *'INTIMATE STORIES' Directed by Carlos Sorin. Starring Javier Lombardo (not rated, 92 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). The modest gem of Argentine film, set in Patagonia, conveys starkly and unemotionally what it really feels like to live in a wilderness with next to nothing. For the characters who wouldn't understand the concept of upward mobility, this is simply the way life is. The story interweaves vignettes of travelers from the same rural village bound for the provincial capital 200 miles away. One is an old man (Antonio Bendectis), who takes to the road to find his runaway dog; another is a single mother (Javiera Bravo) who becomes a contestant on a TV game show; the third (Mr. Lombardo); is a traveling salesman. The journey promises redemption to one, riches to another, and true love to a third. HOLDEN    'INSIDE DEEP THROAT' Written and directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (NC-17, 90 minutes). It was the image seen -- cheered and jeered, canonized and demonized -- around the world. In 1972 Linda Lovelace, nee Linda Boreman, star of the notorious hard-core movie ''Deep Throat,'' played the role that would bequeath her a tawdry and lasting celebrity. With a single act of extreme fellatio, this dazed and often confused 23-year-old became a pinup for the party animal's sexual revolution and, in time, a martyr in the crusade against pornography. But as is clear from this lively, if maddeningly reductive documentary, Ms. Boreman was also little more than a pawn, an empty vessel for opportunists from both sides of the pornography divide. The documentary is a ''slam, bam, thank you, ma'am'' trifle of an entertainment, one strategically packaged for Generation A.D.D. DARGIS    'THE JACKET' Directed by John Maybury. Starring Adrien Brody (R, 102 minutes). Mr. Brody plays Jack Starks, a soldier in the first Gulf War who survives a bullet wound to the head, fixes a pickup truck in Vermont, and is then sent to a spooky psychiatric hospital for a murder he did not commit. There, things get really weird, as a sinister doctor (Kris Kristofferson) straps him into a jacket and shoves him in a drawer, in the name of some misguided therapeutic ideal, or perhaps just because he is a sadistic brute. The drawer, or maybe the jacket, enables Jack to propel himself forward in time, where he meets Keira Knightley, playing a lonely, hard-drinking waitress. The movie, full of red herrings, visual gimmicks, and instances of egregious over-acting, is awfully silly, but not completely awful. In his less hyperactive moments, Mr. Maybury is able to conjure a mood of tenderness and menace, and Mr. Brody's haunted intelligence goes nicely with Ms. Knightley's jumpy intensity. The picture starts out trying to be craftily clever and ends up artlessly dumb, which is to say that it improves as it goes along, sliding from jumped-up paranoia into squishy sentiment.

On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' directed by Jack O'Brien and starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a queasy slouch.

BRANTLEY    ++* 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    'AFTER ASHLEY' If the last two hours of Gina Gionfriddo's play were as fine as the first 15 minutes, we'd have something to cheer. But the spark of interest ignited by the fresh first scene, a disarming and funny heart-to-heart between a confused mother and her teenage son, is all but extinguished by the time this finger-wagging satire has concluded. Ms. Gionfriddo's target is America's taste for blood, and its tabloid-tinged, sex-crime-addicted popular media. Despite some fine work from Anna Paquin and particularly Kieran Culkin, the director Terry Kinney's production is sabotaged by the conflicting impulses in the writing (2:15). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212)353-0303. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    +* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion. Staking no claim to artistic significance, it makes a nice sound, looks pretty (if you like pretty boys) and sends you home with a smile. The show comprises a dozen sly parodies cooked up by the skilled songwriters Gary Adler and Michael Patrick Walker, with winking choruses like, ''Girl, you make me want to wait.'' All the guys have terrific voices and nimble limbs, and each gets a moment to linger in the solo spotlight. (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $66 to $69.  ISHERWOOD    ++'ENDGAME' Tony Roberts, the actor often used by Woody Allen to epitomize suave charm in contrast to his own hapless shlubbery, moves into new territory as Hamm in this middling revival of Samuel Beckett's caustic comedy about man's fumbling reckoning with extinction. Mr. Roberts's urbanity is naturally translated into Hamm's imperiousness. But this production is sharper at etching the play's mordant humor than outlining the heaving shoals of dread on which it should rest. Nevertheless, it's also notable for the performance of Alvin Epstein, a superlative Beckett interpreter, as Nagg (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212)727-2737. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $50.  ISHERWOOD    'GHETTO SUPERSTAR (THE MAN THAT I AM)' Midway through this musical autobiography, Billy Porter describes the moment that changed his life: His teenage encounter, via the Tony Awards telecast, with Jennifer Holliday's galvanizing performance of ''And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going.'' Those emotions play roles in this unabashedly sentimental show, but they ultimately take a back seat to righteous flamboyance. The hallmarks of Mr. Porter's personal history will not be revelations to theatergoers who have accompanied other gay men in the performing arts on similar journeys through shame and confusion to self-acceptance. But Mr. Porter's performance of various pop songs, show tunes and original compositions is vibrant and enjoyable. (1:40). Public Theater, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Thursday through Monday at 7 p.m.; Saturday matinee at 2. Tickets: $45.  ISHERWOOD    'HIDING BEHIND COMETS' The dynamics of the guy-walks-into-a-bar play are tricky. Inject a set of twins into the mix, as Brian Dykstra does in his play, and you've pretty much doomed the venture. In fiction they too often seem like a cheap gimmick. The twins here are a male-female pair, 20-somethings named Troy (Robert Mollohan) and Honey (Moira MacDonald). They mind their father's dingy bar. The stranger who intrudes is Cole (Dan Moran), an elliptical older fellow with a temper. After much verbal sparring, and a lot of sex talk that isn't very sexy, the point emerges: Cole was supposedly at Jonestown during the mass suicide there in 1978, and he has dropped by the bar to force Honey and Troy to rethink their parentage. Mr. Dykstra's script sounds as if it's banking on the shock value of Jonestown, hoping that the audience, like the idiot twins on the stage, will not have heard of it. Way too early for that (1:45). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, (212)868-4444. Thursdays through Mondays at 8 p.m.; matinee on Saturday at 3. Tickets: $35; $40 for Fridays and Saturday evenings.  NEIL GENZLINGER    * 'HOUSE/LIGHTS' The Wooster Group made the right choice when it selected ''House/Lights'' to embody its three decades of work. This technically dazzling production, based on a Gertrude Stein libretto, uses simulcast video monitors and voice-layering synthesizers to spin everything that is said and done into an orbit of multiple effects. The effect is as exhilarating as it is disorienting, capturing the impact of technology-driven life in a way that flat film and computer imagery never can. The subject may be dehumanization, but the cast is among the most vital and theatrically disciplined you will ever see. (1:10) St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718)254-8779. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m. Tickets: $30 on Wednesdays and Thursdays; $37 Fridays through Sundays.  BRANTLEY    'I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE' The prolific British novelist J. B. Priestley was fascinated by the concept of time, and his play suggests that individuals repeat their life cycles until they break free from past mistakes. Based partly on the author's readings of the Russian philosopher P.D. Ouspensky, the theory is described in the play by the mysterious German émigré Dr. Görtler. Dr. Görtler, like the five other characters at the Black Bull Inn on the moors of North Yorkshire in 1937, is a mechanical device for the working out of the Priestley-Ouspensky puzzle. And as demonstrated by the Pearl Theater Company cast, in what the troupe says is the first revival of the play in New York since it appeared on Broadway in 1938, where it flopped, there isn't much wiggle room when you are a device instead of a character. Symbolism aside, the pleasure of the evening is in watching the players move about with easy familiarity (all have worked together before at the Pearl), under Gus Kaikkonen's direction, on the snug, rose-colored set by Takeshi Kata, with its four clocks that tick and chime at melodramatic moments. (2:30) Pearl Theater Company, Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 and $50.  ANDREA STEVENS    +'INKY' Beware the nanny with bruised knuckles. That's the only cogent conclusion to draw from Rinne Groff's peculiar and unfocused comedy about the competitive ethics of the 1980's. The title is the odd nickname for the odd main character, a Manhattan au pair obsessed with Muhammad Ali. Inky is played by a talented newcomer to the New York stage, Jessi Campbell. The play traces her influence on her employers, a harried young businessman and his demanding wife. Unfortunately, Ms. Groff is too vague in her use of boxing symbolism, and too loose in her observation of character, for her ideas about the aridity of the rat race to hit home (1:20). Women's Project, at the Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $47.  ISHERWOOD    'THE LAST DAYS OF JUDAS ISCARIOT' This latest work from the author of ''Jesus Hopped the A Train'' brings to mind an unusually lively senior-class project. Thank heaven -- a subject much discussed in this debate of a drama about the Bible's most famous betrayal -- that at least the person in charge is the class cutup. And that he is popular enough to recruit some really cool friends (including Eric Bogosian, Sam Rockwell and the show's director, Philip Seymour Hoffman). Still, the colorful vernacular speech and flashy performances can't disguise the impression that the play is a heavily footnoted position paper on a big, big subject (2:40) . Public Theater/Martinson Hall, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: Things will look a lot more impressive than they actually are if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind ''Lazer Vaudeville,'' a show with lots of color, not much substance and a future asterisk: it is the last production in the John Houseman Theater, slated for demolition. The show is a hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by Carter Brown, Cindy Marvell and Nicholas Flair, who are moderately engaging but don't seem to be having quite enough fun. Ms. Marvell is a first-class juggler and never disappoints, and there's a funny little hat fandango involving all three, but some of the men's bits and ensemble pieces don't have much wow factor. Perhaps the three know they are short on razzmatazz, because they constantly shut off the lights and let their glow-in-the-dark ropes and batons do the talking. It looks cool, but, left alone in the dark once too often, some may find themselves forced to admit, ''Doggone it, that's just a guy twirling a rope'' (1:30). John Houseman Theater, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Mondays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 11 a.m., 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $45.  GENZLINGER    +'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater. It is always paying homage to itself. Parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs is smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in the case of ''The Musical of Musicals!'' Two of the performers are also the creators: Joanne Bogart (lyrics) and Eric Rockwell (music). Aided by Lovette George and Craig Fols, they offer spoofs in the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Kander and Ebb. (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 5oth Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $56 to $59.50.  MARGO JEFFERSON    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success. Mr. Pendleton, an actor and acting teacher, reimagines this theatrical footnote as a quietly momentous turning point in the emotional and professional lives of everyone involved, including Olivier's outgoing and incoming wives, Vivien Leigh and Joan Plowright, and the critic Kenneth Tynan. While Mr. Pendleton smartly exploits the frailties of these graying artistic lions for comedy, there is an abiding respect and affection in his irreverence and in the fastidious performances of director David Cromer's fine cast (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: 55.  ISHERWOOD    'ROMANCE' Listen up, you mugs. Nobody makes fun of David Mamet, see, because David Mamet can take care of that all by hisself. In the latest work from this most imitated and parodied of living American playwrights, Mr. Mamet knocks the four-letter stuffing out of his own staccato style. He then proceeds to beat up on the courtoom drama, the classic farce, ethnic and sexual stereotypes and his audience. It's a take-no-prisoners approach that, unfortunately, doesn't take any laughs either. Neil Pepe directs an irreproachable but ineffective cast that includes Larry Bryggman and Bob Balaban (1:35). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55.  BRANTLEY    ++* 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories from the mid-19th century, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest. Directed by Julian Crouch and Phelim McDermott, and featuring bizarrely beautiful songs by Martyn Jacques, ''Shockheaded Peter'' manages to wallow in and tear apart our enduring appetite for scaring ourselves. Though styled as a Victorian peep show, this British import makes contemporary self-spoofing horror exercises (like Wes Craven's ''Scream'' movies) look like, well, child's play (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Thursdays at 10 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $21.25 to $66.25.  BRANTLEY    'SHYLOCK' Deconstructing Shakespeare is a dangerous sport; it's impossible to be more imaginative or clever than the playwright himself, even if you are Harold Bloom. Gareth Armstrong gives it a game try, but ''Shylock,'' his 80-minute dissertation on the evolution of one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters, although deftly performed, is no exception. While his pocket synopses of anti-Semitism, Elizabethan England, Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' and even a Baedeker of famous actors' renditions of Shylock are edifying, they are not sufficiently enlightening or entertaining. The most riveting lines of Mr. Armstrong's monologue belong to Shakespeare himself (1:35). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55; a limited number of $20 student/senior rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance.  PHOEBE HOBAN    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. This monologue, which runs just over an hour and requires minimal stagecraft, is as unassuming in its means as it is astonishing in its impact. It's one of those treasured nights in the theater -- treasured nights anywhere, for that matter -- that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Mr. Eno and his performer, the actor James Urbaniak, reinvent that seemingly moribund theatrical genre, the solo show. They are immeasurably aided by the work of the director Hal Brooks. Mr. Eno's voice, or the voice of the narrator/protagonist/master of ceremonies played by Mr. Urbaniak, is alternately lyrical and affectless, ecstatic and flat, sardonic and sincere. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative: Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets; $45.  ISHERWOOD    +'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson and directed by Casey Childs, the play is gaudy and moderately fun, basically a big chunk of theatrical costume jewelry. It concentrates, as these borderline morbid celebrity showcases often do, on the declining arc of its subject's worldly career, and gives us the usual generous doses of dysfunction and despair beneath the glittering resume. Ms. Ruehl gives a vigorous, enjoyably big performance, but even her hard work can't inflate the flatter stretches in the writing (1:40). Promenade Theater, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25.  ISHERWOOD    Off Off Broadway    'GORILLA MAN' The usual afflictions befalling teenage boys -- acne, scuffed skateboards, the indifference of that girl in homeroom -- pale in comparison to the plight of Billy, the hero of this pop musical by Kyle Jarrow. Billy wakes one morning to find he is turning into a man-eating beast. Lonely and confused, he sets out to find the father who bequeathed him the genes that brought on this misfortune. On a deeper level, he seeks an answer to the profound question that has stumped philosophers, theologians and adolescents for at least a couple of millennia: ''Why me?'' There are many laughs in Mr. Jarrow's self-consciously silly book and well-tailored pop-rock songs, but the show's overall conception, which layers horror-movie melodramatics over a pseudo-earnest inquiry into questions of fate and free will, is ultimately juvenile (1:20). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288. Thursdays through Saturdays at 9 p.m.; Sundays at 6 p.m. Tickets: $15.  ISHERWOOD    'PENTECOST' The Barrow Group's inaugural production in its new theater couldn't be much more ambitious: the New York premiere of ''Pentecost,'' a 1994 drama by the British playwright David Edgar. Written in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the play tackles everything from the origin of Western Renaissance art to America's pop-cultural hegemony to hostage negotiations. The writing is engaging and the staging keeps things moving. It's too bad, though, that Mr. Edgar didn't just stick with revolutionizing art history rather than trying to revolutionize the world (2:45). Barrow Group Arts Center, 312 West 36th Street, Manhattan, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Mondays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $40.  HOBAN    'PULLMAN, WA' This new avant-garde work by Young Jean Lee has the deadpan simplicity of the plays of Richard Maxwell and the awkward, secretly suffering angst of a teenage diarist working through an identity crisis. Artifice is the enemy. There are no props or set (outside of two chairs); the lights never change; and the costumes look like the clothes that the actors might have worn to the movies earlier in the day. The play begins when Pete Simpson, a dead-eyed and strangely hypnotic actor, walks onstage and tells the audience that he know how to live. Don't get your hopes up. The entire play could be seen as a send-up of the self-help industry, a dry comment on its tough love and easy answers. It will surely not win over many who are already skeptical about experimental theater. But while this is not a major work, it is an honest one that takes itself seriously -- and that is refreshing (1:00) . Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288. Thursdays through Saturdays at 7 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $15.  JASON ZINOMAN    Last Chance    'A MAN'S BEST FRIEND' At the beginning of Jeffrey M. Jones's crackpot farce, ''A Man's Best Friend,'' a clown with white makeup smeared across his face nonchalantly walks onstage and asks the other five members of the cast, ''Do I smell?'' They all make faces as if the answer is obvious and then quickly exit. This is only the first joke of the evening, but it provides a very precise indicator of the brand of humor that you're in for during the 80 minutes of this juvenile comedy. Mr. Jones is constantly throwing new oddities into the mix, even if they don't serve any purpose. You may often find yourself wondering, what's the point of this scene? Best not to ask too many questions of this kind of show, which seems more determined to be wacky than anything else. Its style is somewhere between David Lindsay-Abaire's ''Fuddy Meers'' and a Coney Island sideshow. (1:20). Walker Space, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $15.  ZINOMAN    'A VERY NAUGHTY GREEK PLAY (UTOPIA PARKWAY)' How do you update a 2,400-year-old comedy? The Aquila Theater Company's answer: create a version of Aristophanes' ''Wasps'' that has some of the dumbness of ''Saturday Night Live'' and the zaniness of Monty Python, without being as funny as either. From rubber chickens to inflatable sex mannequins played like air guitars, the piece brings in an arsenal of comedy gags to drive home this story about a politically conservative father (named Kokkos, or ''Red'') and his liberal son Huakinthos (''Blue''), arguing over a political leader named Thamnos (''small, leafy shrub'' -- a Bush by any other name). It's a shame to see so much talent and energy expended for so slender a result. (1:25). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington Avenue and Third Avenue, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 5 and 9 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 and $45; $15 for stageside ''Greek Seats,'' from which audience participants are drawn.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone -- two times when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie, where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, that preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. (It won five Oscars, including best supporting actress for Cate Blanchett.) Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 1920's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'BE COOL' Directed by F. Gary Gray. Starring John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Christina Milian (PG-13, 112 minutes). In ''Be Cool,'' Mr. Travolta, wearing black and the glazed look of the overly pampered and chronically bored, returns as Chili Palmer, the reformed mobster he first played in Barry Sonnenfeld's 1995 adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel ''Get Shorty.'' That movie arrived hot on the heels of ''Pulp Fiction,'' a film that in turn owed a serviceable debt to Mr. Leonard's oeuvre. But while ''Get Shorty'' rode the ''Pulp Fiction'' craze with finesse, largely propelled by Mr. Travolta's star presence and a screenplay from Scott Frank, ''Be Cool'' is running on empty, fueled by nothing more than the faintest of vapors left over from those earlier successes. The new film was written by Peter Steinfeld, whose draggy, generally unfunny screenplay packs in a lot of the same characters from the Leonard novel (the sequel to ''Get Shorty'') and too much of its overworked, conceptually anemic plot.  DARGIS    'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' Starring Martin Henderson and Aishwarya Rai. Directed by Gurinder Chadha (PG-13, 111 minutes). Because Ms. Chadha knows how to sell multiplex multiculturalism -- her last feature was ''Bend It Like Beckham'' -- the pitch for her new film probably ran something along the lines of: ''Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' recontextualized as a Bollywood musical (only shorter) and set against the backdrop of the new global economy.'' Whatever the case, the new film -- which transposes Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India, with layovers in swinging London and sunny Los Angeles -- is as high concept and rife with cliché as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. Think ''My Big Fat Sari Wedding'' tricked out with clumsy song-and-dance numbers and delivered with much finger-wagging about cultural tolerance. The kicker here being that the wagging finger belongs to the story's heroine, here called Lalita (Ms. Rai, radiantly beautiful but inert), and the object of her high-mindedness is none other than a wealthy American, Will Darcy (Mr. Henderson, just inert).  DARGIS    'CONSTANTINE' Starring Keanu Reeves. Directed by Francis Lawrence (R, 122 minutes). Hell's bells! Sprung from the Matrix, Mr. Reeves glowers his way through another effect-heavy, convoluted journey between worlds, in this case defined by theology rather than technology. He is John Constantine, who travels back and forth between our world and the one below, working as a kind of freelance border guard, sending stray demons back into the fiery depths. But something big is brewing, involving rebel angels, the son of Satan, and a whole lot of pseudo-biblical mumbo jumbo. Assisting Mr. Reeves are Rachel Weisz, as a Los Angeles police detective whose sister has jumped off a roof, and Shia LeBoeuf as an eager dabbler in the occult. Tilda Swinton is the angel Gabriel, doing a bit of slumming after boffo work in Milton's ''Paradise Lost.'' A.O.  SCOTT    'DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN' Starring Kimberly Elise, Tyler Perry and Cicely Tyson. Directed by Darren Grant. (PG-13, 116 minutes). This movie is so oblivious to genre that it occupies its own special stylistic niche, if you can imagine such a thing as a romantic revenge farce. As the story of a cruelly abandoned wife's reascendance zigzags from soap opera to slapstick to church sermon and back, it goes from A to Z on the all-things-to-all-people meter: Cinderella meets Amos 'n' Andy in Sunday school, so to speak.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'DOWNFALL' Starring Bruno Ganz. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. (No rating, 155 minutes; in German, with English subtitles). Mr. Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses around him, and the Red Army closes in. Surrounding him are his followers, some fanatically loyal, others wavering in the face of defeat, who must all play out the endgame of their ghastly world-historical project. Mr. Hirschsbiegel's film, taking place at the moment when the energies of Nazism turned from murder to suicide, is engrossing and well made, but it does not generate much feeling beyond a queasy, prurient fascination. Its most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it.  SCOTT    * 'GUNNER PALACE' Directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein. (PG-13, 86 minutes). Mr. Tucker spent several months in late 2003 and early 2004 in Baghdad recording the lives and words of members of the Army's 2/3 Field Artillery division (known as the Gunners), who were living in an opulent, bomb-damaged palace that once belonged to Uday Hussein. The resulting film is raw, powerful and confusing -- less a polished documentary than a living, unfinished document of a complicated war and the complicated young men who are fighting it. We accompany them on raids and patrols, witness their moments of leisure, and hear their own conflicted responses to their experiences, conveyed through jokes, video diaries, poems and hip-hop freestyling. Whatever your opinions of the war in Iraq, this film will provide a necessary jolt of confusion, which is the first step toward an unsentimental understanding of who the American troops are and what they face.  SCOTT    'HOSTAGE' Directed by Florent Siri. Starring Bruce Willis and Kevin Pollak (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Mr. Willis's fading career as an action hero. The star plays a former hostage negotiator who has exiled himself to a quiet southern California town after a botched standoff. He springs back into action when the cliff-hugging mansion of a crooked book-cooking corporate accountant (Mr. Pollak) is simultaneously invaded by a posse of teenage punks and by a S.W.A.T. team of high-tech gangsters. The fiery demolition of this architectural monstrosity in which the accountant lives with his two children is the only thing worth applauding in this mess of film.  HOLDEN    'IN MY COUNTRY' Directed by John Boorman. Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Juliette Binoche (R, 104 minutes). Ms. Binoche, playing a South African poet and reporter, is the weepy hand-wringing conscience of the high-minded but hopelessly wooden film that examines the public hearings conducted by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission in the late 1990's. At the hearings, victims of human rights abuse during Apartheid confronted the perpetrators in court, both sides seeking ''ubuntu,'' or forgiveness instead of revenge. Mr. Jackson is an American reporter who brings his own angry racial agenda to the hearings. The screenplay, by Ann Peacock, who adapted the story from Antjie Krog's memoir, ''Country of My Skull,'' makes the fatal mistake of turning characters into mouthpieces engaged in stiff, point-counterpoint moral debate.  HOLDEN    * 'INTIMATE STORIES' Directed by Carlos Sorin. Starring Javier Lombardo (not rated, 92 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). The modest gem of Argentine film, set in Patagonia, conveys starkly and unemotionally what it really feels like to live in a wilderness with next to nothing. For the characters who wouldn't understand the concept of upward mobility, this is simply the way life is. The story interweaves vignettes of travelers from the same rural village bound for the provincial capital 200 miles away. One is an old man (Antonio Bendectis), who takes to the road to find his runaway dog; another is a single mother (Javiera Bravo) who becomes a contestant on a TV game show; the third (Mr. Lombardo); is a traveling salesman. The journey promises redemption to one, riches to another, and true love to a third.  HOLDEN    'INSIDE DEEP THROAT' Written and directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (NC-17, 90 minutes). It was the image seen -- cheered and jeered, canonized and demonized -- around the world. In 1972 Linda Lovelace, nee Linda Boreman, star of the notorious hard-core movie ''Deep Throat,'' played the role that would bequeath her a tawdry and lasting celebrity. With a single act of extreme fellatio, this dazed and often confused 23-year-old became a pinup for the party animal's sexual revolution and, in time, a martyr in the crusade against pornography. But as is clear from this lively, if maddeningly reductive documentary, Ms. Boreman was also little more than a pawn, an empty vessel for opportunists from both sides of the pornography divide. The documentary is a ''slam, bam, thank you, ma'am'' trifle of an entertainment, one strategically packaged for Generation A.D.D.  DARGIS    'THE JACKET' Directed by John Maybury. Starring Adrien Brody (R, 102 minutes). Mr. Brody plays Jack Starks, a soldier in the first Gulf War who survives a bullet wound to the head, fixes a pickup truck in Vermont, and is then sent to a spooky psychiatric hospital for a murder he did not commit. There, things get really weird, as a sinister doctor (Kris Kristofferson) straps him into a jacket and shoves him in a drawer, in the name of some misguided therapeutic ideal, or perhaps just because he is a sadistic brute. The drawer, or maybe the jacket, enables Jack to propel himself forward in time, where he meets Keira Knightley, playing a lonely, hard-drinking waitress. The movie, full of red herrings, visual gimmicks, and instances of egregious over-acting, is awfully silly, but not completely awful. In his less hyperactive moments, Mr. Maybury is able to conjure a mood of tenderness and menace, and Mr. Brody's haunted intelligence goes nicely with Ms. Knightley's jumpy intensity. The picture starts out trying to be craftily clever and ends up artlessly dumb, which is to say that it improves as it goes along, sliding from jumped-up paranoia into squishy sentiment.  SCOTT    * 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio in 2004. (It won Oscars for best picture, best director for Mr. Eastwood, best actress for Ms. Swank and best supporting actor for Mr. Freeman.)  SCOTT    * 'MILLIONS' Directed by Danny Boyle. Starring Alex Etel (PG, 97 minutes). When it comes to making movies, Mr. Boyle is usually up to no good, which is something this visual stylist does with great ostentatious flair. Best known for ''Trainspotting,'' a grungy entertainment about the gleefully down and out, and for the shiver-filled zombie flick ''28 Days Later,'' Mr. Boyle is the sort of creative type in whom the milk of human kindness often seems to curdle rather than flow. Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves his stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. Pegged to a motherless child named Damian (Alex Etel, making a sensational debut), ''Millions'' is about the secret world of children, in particular that miraculous, tragically brief interlude when the young imagination -- not yet captive to crippling adult conventions like time, space and rational thought -- takes boundless flight.  DARGIS    'THE PACIFIER' Directed by Adam Shankman. Starring Vin Diesel (PG, 97 minutes). In the primary visual gag of ''The Pacifier,'' a Navy Seal, on a top-secret babysitting mission, retrofits his gun and grenade holders to keep baby formula and diapers at the ready. Despite the specter of boogeymen, Disney's new family flick remains chipper and occasionally clever, as it sends up the high-tech know-how required in 21st-century parenting. As a special-ops warrior with a heart-thawing assignment, Mr. Diesel succeeds as a genre-switcher through the help of an able ensemble. The mayhem should delight kids, just as the imposed order will please parents. Anyone else, however, might feel as though they are, in Mr. Diesel's words, merely ''burning daylight.''  NED MARTEL    'ROBOTS' Directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha. With the voices of Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry and Robin Williams (PG, 89 minutes). Like so many other non-Pixar computer-animated family movies, this one, from Fox's Blue Sky Studios, runs on visual novelty and narrative familiarity. The setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination, as are the characters, an assortment of dented heroes and sleek, silvery villains. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions, cool soundtrack music and heartwarming lessons about being yourself and following your dreams. There is, it must be said, a certain honesty to the story, which suggests that recycled, second-hand junk is superior to the latest high-tech upgrades, a moral the movie at once upholds and refutes.  SCOTT    'UP AND DOWN' Starring Petr Forman and Emilia Vasaryova. Directed by Jan Hrebejk (R, 108 minutes; in Czech, with English subtitles). This engaging, unruly mix of comedy and melodrama follows the mood swings suggested by its title. Tracing the generally unhappy doings of a dozen or so loosely connected people in contemporary Prague, it skips from buoyant satire to domestic melodrama, leaving behind a curious mix of emotions. It is not often you see a movie so bracingly pessimistic about the human condition that dispenses its dose of bad news with such good cheer. A baby is illegally adopted by a former soccer hooligan; an émigré returns for a reunion with his broken family -- all in an atmosphere of petty crime, anxiety about immigration and general puzzlement at the state of the world (or at least the Czech Republic) -- 15 years after the end of Communism.  SCOTT    'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' Directed by Mike Binder. Starring Joan Allen, Kevin Costner, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell and Alicia Witt (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Mr. Costner and Ms. Allen to do some marvelous work. Both performances are somewhat familiar: Mr. Costner, once again, is an athlete past his prime, and Ms. Allen is a brittle, unhappy suburban housewife, but the actors slip into their characters with ease and wit, and complement each other beautifully as they explore a haphazard friendship that turns into a love affair. The downside is that Mr. Binder does not give them enough of a dramatic context to work in, and undermines their efforts with a surprise ending that very nearly destroys the whole movie. Ms. Witt, Ms. Christensen, Ms. Wood and Ms. Russell play Ms. Allen's daughters, but their characters are as thinly conceived as figures in a television pilot, and it is hard to believe that the four of them and Ms. Allen add up to a family.  SCOTT    Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * AMORPHIS, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. This Finnish band embraces a style some people call melodic death metal, matching gravelly vocals and (sometimes) whiplash tempos with big, often heroic melodies and precise guitar lines that evoke progressive rock. Sunday night at 7, with Beyond the Embrace, Into Eternity, Single Bullet Theory and With Passion; tickets are $15 in advance, $17 at the door.  KELEFA SANNEH    * DANIEL BELL, CABANNE, downstairs at Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. A minimalist dance party starring two DJ's who like their tracks stripped-down and twitchy. Mr. Bell, a longtime minimal techno producer, is known for his sleek but restless style, and for an excellent 2000 compilation, ''The Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell'' (Tresor), a surprisingly warm disc full of precise party music. The 2003 follow-up was ''The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!''(Logistic), which included a pair of mischievous, rubbery tracks from Cabanne, a French producer and DJ who is also on tonight's bill. Tonight after 9, with Spinoza and Movement; admission is $5.  SANNEH    LIZ CARROLL AND JOHN DOYLE, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155. Liz Carroll, one of the finest Celtic fiddlers in the United States, has won an All-Ireland fiddling championship as well as a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. She isn't afraid to let a little of the Celtic diaspora into her Irish fiddle tunes; touches of bluegrass technique put an American twinkle into the old jigs and reels. She has teamed up with the guitarist and singer John Doyle, formerly of the group Solas, who brings a deep Celtic flavor to the modal syncopation of his guitar and his finely ornamented singing. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $18 in advance, $20 tomorrow.  JON PARELES    CELTIC FIDDLE FESTIVAL/ROSHEEN, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212) 576-1155. Celtic Fiddle Festival is a trans-Atlantic alliance with three fiddlers. Kevin Burke grew up in an Irish family in England and has become one of the most authoritative traditional Irish musicians alive, sweet and lightning-fast. Christian LeMaitre plays the Celtic music of Brittany, and Andre Brunet comes from the French Canadian group La Bottine Sourriante. They're accompanied by the guitarist Ged Foley. They share the bill with Rosheen, a seven-member Celtic group from Quebec started by the singer Lynn Valliéres, who sings in English and French. Sunday night at 7; tickets are $22.50 in advance, $25 tomorrow.  PARELES    EL GRAN COMBO, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, (212)239-2672. El Gran Combo was formed in 1962 and has been consistently on the Latin charts ever since. By now, it's an institution, still singing about matters close to the heart of Puerto Ricans on the island and far away. Tomorrow night, doors open at 10; admission is $25.  PARELES    * ODETTA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212) 576-1155. Odetta has been a blues powerhouse since the 1950's, strumming hard and singing with a deep, leathery voice that harks back to field hollers and sprituals. She gives her songs the authority of archetypes. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $30.  PARELES    * OM, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. Matt Pike, formerly of the excellent slow-motion metal band Sleep, now leads his own loud and utterly hypnotic band High on Fire. The other two former Sleep members play together in OM, a bass-and-drums duo that celebrates its buzzy, bleary new album, ''Variations on a Theme'' (Holy Mountain), at this show -- the album consists solely of three long tracks, so expect a long, cyclical set. Tomorrow night at 7:30, with Hidden Hand and Unearthly Trance; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 at the door.  SANNEH    OZRIC TENTACLES, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. England has jam bands, too, and Ozric Tentacles may be the most well-traveled one of them. Its songs start with the suite-like complexities of progressive rock, and take off from there. Tomorrow night at 9, with Lotus opening; tickets are $20 in advance, $23 tomorrow.  PARELES    PSARANTONIS/HAINIDES ENSEMBLE, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824 or (212)545-7536. This double bill of Greek music from Crete features, Psarantonis, the scion of a long line of musicians who has been making albums since 1964. He sings and plays the lyra--an upright, throaty-toned fiddle capable of fierce, danceable melodies or husky laments--and leads an ensemble that includes his daughter and two sons. Hainides, the group sharing the bill, is an ensemble of younger musicians who play both Cretan traditional music and music from across Greece. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25 to $45, or $15 for students.  PARELES    TOSHI REAGON, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Toshi Reagon applies her gutsy voice and her love of blues and funk to songs that address love and politics with the same sense of independence. With her band Big Lovely and, in a show to mark the imminent closing of Fez, unannounced guests. Tonight at 8; tickets are $15.  PARELES    LES SANS CULOTTES, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street below Stanton Street, (212)505-3733. The light-headed charm of the 1960's French rock known as ''ye-ye'' is concept enough for Les San Culottes, a Brooklyn band. Campiness is virtually built in to the fuzz-toned guitars, electric organ, cooing female voices and know-it-all male growls. Tomorrow night at 11:30, with Gaijin a Go Go at 10:30, the Dansettes at 9:30, Locksley at 8:30 and the New Rags at 7:30; admission is $8.  PARELES    CHRIS SCRUGGS, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue at 27th Street, (212)683-6500. Chris Scruggs, the grandson of the pioneering bluegrass banjo player Earl Scruggs, returned to country by way of punk, working with Rosie Flores and with his mother, Gail Davies, and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry before joining the smart retro Nashville band BR549 as singer and guitarist in 2001. He left the group in January to resume his solo career, dipping into Western swing, rockabilly and 1960's rock. Tonight and tomorrow, three sets start at 10; admission is free.  PARELES    * SPRING BLING, Wild Palm, 1601 Bronxdale Avenue, off East Tremont, the Bronx; dancehallreggae.com. This reggae party plays features a pair of big-name DJ crews, Massive B (led by Bobby Konders and Jabba, the team behind Hot 97's long-running Sunday night reggae show) and the mighty Jamaican sound system Stone Love. Expect to hear lots of the sweet (and, for that matter, salty) neo-roots reggae records that are currently all the rage in Kingston -- in reggae, these days, everyone's feeling nostalgic. The old-school hip-hop star (and current Hot 97 radio personality) Jazzy Joyve is to serve as host. Tomorrow night after 10; admission is $20.  SANNEH    THE TEMPTATIONS/THE FOUR TOPS, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)749-5838 or (212)864-0372. A double bill from the glory days of Motown. The Temptations were Motown's vehicle for both virile pleading (as in ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg'') and funk-driven realism (as in ''Papa Was a Rolling Stone''). The Four Tops were a paragon of group longevity, with the same lineup from 1954 until the death of Lawrence Payton in 1997. They still have Levi Stubbs's dynamic baritone to charge through Motown classics like ''Reach Out I'll Be There'' and ''I Can't Help Myself.'' Saturday and Sunday nights at 8; tickets are $37 to $67.  PARELES    RHONDA VINCENT/JIM LAUDERDALE, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. A pair of mavericks with country roots. Rhonda Vincent sings, plays mandolin, and pushes bluegress in some modern directions without forgetting standards like ''Muleskinner Blues.'' The rangy-voiced singer Jim Lauderdale has collaborated with everyone from the bluegrass patriarch Ralph Stanley to the jam band Donna the Buffalo, and on his 2004 album ''Headed for the Hills'' (Dualtone), he wrote songs with the Grateful Dead's lyricst Robert Hunter. Tonight at 6:30 and 9; tickets are $25.  PARELES    JIMMY WEBB, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. As the writer of hits like ''Macarthur Park,'' ''By the Time I Get to Phoenix,'' ''Where's the Playground, Susie'' and ''Wichita Lineman,'' Jimmy Webb is a patriarch of lachrymose, existential pop epics with soaring tunes. Tonight at 8; tickets are $35.  PARELES    ZEN TRICKSTERS, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side (212)260-4700. The Zen Tricksters got started two decades ago playing Grateful Dead songs. While they now have their own songs to jam on, they haven't forgotten their early repertory; no less a figure than Phil Lesh of the Dead has called on their expertise. Tonight, playing two sets that start at 10:30, with CatWalkBlue opening at 8:30; tickets are $14.  PARELES    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BETTY BUCKLEY, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)744-1600. The unifying thought behind the singer's new show, ''Smoke,'' is the evanescence of perfect moments, often romantic ones, that we can't hold onto try as we might. The signature number in this smart, carefully balanced program that embraces jazz, country, bossa nova, pop standards, soft rock and art songs is Mary Chapin Carpenter's pop-country ''When Time Stands Still.'' Ms. Buckley's pianist, Kenny Werner, makes a formidable musical contribution. Tonight and tomorrow nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $90; no minimum.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    * BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.  HOLDEN    * 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30 with a $10 minimum at a table.  HOLDEN    * TIERNEY SUTTON, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. Ms. Sutton is a pure jazz spirit who respects a song. Even when going out on an improvisatory limb, she never lets its essence slip away. The singer and her trio with whom she has worked for years -- Christian Jacob on piano, Kevin Axt on bass and Ray Brinker on drums -- have refined the kind of rapport that could only be achieved over time. Her deep, lingering renditions of chestnuts like ''Blue Skies'' and ''Without a Song'' are especially impressive for the sense of quiet joy she breathes into them. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30 p.m. Cover: $50, with a $20 minimum; a $50 prix fixe dinner is required at the early shows.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * PETER BERNSTEIN TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. Mr. Bernstein is fluidly improvising guitarist in the post-bop tradition, with control over harmony and a beautiful sound; he performs here with Larry Goldings on organ and Bill Stewart on drums. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 tonight and tomorrow night, $20 on Sunday.  BEN RATLIFF    * FLY, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)242-1063. An excellent co-operative trio, with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Jeff Ballard. Some of its music sounds chamberlike, some Latin, some funky; some, with breathtaking long-line improvisations and tight group communication, seems to propose a new model for saxophone trios. Tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.  RATLIFF    * HENRY GRIMES-MARSHALL ALLEN, Vision Club, Clemente Soto Velez Gallery, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side; www.visionfestival.org.A duet. The saxophonist Marshall Allen has led the Sun Ra Arkestra since Sun Ra's death, and at times he's a great player, sly and nuanced, taking in the smooth glissandos of Johnny Hodges, as well as the hard-driving, self-contained Chicago R&B style and the squeal of free jazz. Henry Grimes, the bassist, played in some of the greatest groups of the late 50's and 60's, including Sonny Rollins's and Albert Ayler's, before going below the radar for a long period in the 80's; he has recently been rebuilding a career. Tomorrow at 10 pm; admission is $10 for one set, $15 for both.  RATLIFF    * ROY HAYNES QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. An hour spent with Roy Haynes is an hour spent learning about drum sounds. Mr. Haynes was one of the first bebop drummers, having recorded with Bud Powell in 1949, and he plays bop patterns superbly when he wants, charging along with the music to support the frontline players. But more often he guts his playing of bebop clichés, changing his phrasing with every measure. He prefers startling single or double hits to rolling patterns across the drums; he often uses a very low-tuned bass tom and an even lower tympanum. In his late 70's now and still a bandleader in charge of agile young players, he is vitality itself. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover, $25, minimum, $10.  RATLIFF    JOHN HICKS TRIO, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. A presence in New York since the 1960's, Mr. Hicks is a steamroller of a mainstream-jazz pianist, loading up the music with thick chords as if he wanted to do McCoy Tyner one better. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.; cover, $25.  RATLIFF    ROSA PASSOS, Le Jazz Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212)308-9455. Ms. Passos is a Brazilian singer well-versed in the subtleties of João Gilberto's art, and there's so much to admire about her: an impeccable control over a light-gauge voice, a precise sense pitch, a mastery of the complexity and freshness in bossa nova rhythm. Sets tonight and Sunday at 7:30, and tomorrow at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.; $50 cover, tonight and tomorrow, $40 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    BOBBY SANABRIA AND QUARTETO ACHE, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Mr. Sanabria, the drummer and percussionist, is a great Latin-jazz practitioner and historian; he flips through Cuban and Brazilian and African rhythmic idioms and takes excellent jazz musicians along with him. Sets tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20, minimum, $10.  RATLIFF    DR. LONNIE SMITH QUARTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)258-9800. Dr. Smith -- who always appears wearing a turban, to confuse you a little -- is a master of slow, weird ideas on the Hammond organ; working in a setting of good-time, saloon-style jazz, he can turn it into a séance. His band includes the ex-James Brown band trombonist Fred Wesley, the guitarist Rodney Jones and the drummer Lennie White. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, and there is a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.

Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'CANDIDE' Leonard Bernstein's ''Candide'' opened on Broadway in 1956 at the 1,300-seat Martin Beck Theater. Watching the New York City Opera's production that opened on Tuesday night, a revival of the acclaimed 1982 staging by Harold Prince last seen at the company over 15 years ago, I only wished that this mostly delightful production of Bernstein's richest musical theater work, with a book adapted from Voltaire by Hugh Wheeler, could be played in a much smaller auditorium than the 2,700-seat New York State Theater. There is much to like about the City Opera's revival, especially the appealing cast headed by two musical theater veterans in top form: John Cullum in the double role of Voltaire and Dr. Pangloss, and Judy Kaye as the earthy Old Lady, with her vaguely Jewish-Polish accent, who is missing a buttock and full of tales about the calamities of her life. George Manahan conducted a refreshingly relaxed account of a score, giving the music room to breathe and the words space to be spoken clearly. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 1:30 and 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    'ORLANDO' With the sturdy and expressive countertenor Bejun Mehta in the title role (and thus in the mad scene), chances are good that the New York City Opera will continue its run of successes in Handel operas. Chas Rader-Shieber directs, and Antony Walker conducts. The strong cast also includes Amy Burton, Jennifer Aylmer, Matthew White and David Pittsinger. Sunday at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)307-4100. Tickets: $32.50 to $115.50.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    'DER ROSENKAVALIER' Strauss's much admired opera has returned to the Met with some familiar and fresh faces in the cast. Susan Graham is in fine form for her signature role as Octavian, and the pure-voiced Laura Aikin sings Sophie. The newcomer here is the German soprano Angela Denoke, who brings an affecting sense of vulnerability to the world-weary Marschallin. Her high notes don't project as much as they waft gently into the house. In the pit, Donald Runnicles stirs up the Met Orchestra, as if to remind us that ''Rosenkavalier'' has its modern edges, too, but he is also not afraid to bask in the more nostalgic moments of this beautiful score. The Met is still getting mileage off of Nathaniel Merrill's popular production, over three decades old and counting. Tonight at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200.  JEREMY EICHLER    'SAMSON ET DALILA' The portrayal of Samson by the Argentine tenor Jose Cura is the main reason to see the Metropolitan Opera's revival of its 1998 production by Elijah Moshinsky. Mr. Cura had not been back to the Met since his 1999 debut, and in the years since he has maximized his strengths and minimized his shortcomings as a singer. Though purists will still fault his vocal rawness and sometimes rough legato, he gives his all in this role, singing with passion, burnished sound, fearless attack and energy. And with his hunky physique and bold physicality, he commands the stage. Though the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves is a gorgeous and alluring Dalila, and her rich and warm voice is ideal for the role, her singing on opening nights was sometimes shaky and insecure. Bertrand de Billy was the impressive conductor. And, though the bacchanal scene may go down in Met history as a camp classic, audiences will surely enjoy ogling the scantily clad roster of muscled and sexy dancers and extras. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215.  TOMMASINI    Classical Music    CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA OF ST. IGNATIUS LOYOLA If you missed the fine performance of Bach's ''St. John Passion'' on Tuesday at St. Thomas Church, or if you came away from it wanting more, here is the solution. Kent Tritle, who has turned the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola into a thriving center for early music, sacred music and more, leads the church forces in the ''St. John.'' James Archie Worley is the Evangelist and Matt Boehler sings Jesus in what promises to be an excellent event. Tonight at 8, Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212)288-2520. Tickets: $30 and $40; $20 for students and 65+.  OESTREICH    DMITRI HVOROSTOVSKY This great Russian baritone cuts an exotic figure, with his flowing silver mane, but more to the point, he brings a rich tone and a powerful expressivity to his work on both the opera and recital stage. He is at his best in Russian music, and is singing plenty of that tonight, including Mussorgsky's ''Songs and Dances of Death'' and groups of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff songs. For a change of pace, he is also singing a selection of chansons by Duparc. Tonight at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $25 to $89.  ALLAN KOZINN    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM ARTISTS IN CONCERT Tonight the Metropolitan Museum of Art's resident chamber ensemble comprised of excellent musicians, either young in fact or young in spirit, presents the second of three concerts this season at the Grace Rainer Rogers Auditorium, a wonderfully intimate hall for chamber music. Picking up with a series focus on recent music from Eastern Europe and Russia, the ensemble offers Avro Pärt's ''Summa'' and Giya Kancheli's ''Time and Again.'' A novelty, Rossini's String Sonata, and a rousing Romantic work, Mendelssohn's Piano Sextet, complete the program. The cellist Edward Arron is the artistic director of the series, and primarily responsible for the fresh programming. Tonight at 7, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $20; students with valid ID, $5.  TOMMASINI    METROPOLITAN OPERA NATIONAL COUNCIL GRAND FINALS CONCERT This popular yearly event presents the ten young finalists from the Metropolitan Opera's national auditions. Each will perform two arias with the Met Orchestra. Hear the stars of tomorrow today. And if this seems an exaggerating, consider that among the finalists in 1988 were four fledgling singers named Renée Fleming, Ben Heppner, Susan Graham and Heidi Grant Murphy. Ms. Graham serves as host. Guest artists include Sondra Radvanovsky, Jennifer Welch-Babidge and Garret Sorenson. The guests usually sing while the judges are picking the five ''winners,'' though everyone who makes it to this concert is a winner. Sunday at 3 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $25 to $100.  TOMMASINI    SOHEIL NASSERI A recent recital of Beethoven sonatas showed this young Californian pianist to a thoughtful, inventive interpreter and, where the music demands it, a technical powerhouse. His recital tomorrow evening includes the premiere of ''Dance Suite'' by Avner Dorman, a 25-year old Israeli composer who studied with John Corigliano at the Juilliard School, as well as Beethoven's Sonata No. 22 in F (Op. 54), Schubert's Sonata in B (D. 575) and Schumann's ''Humoreske'' (Op. 20), all works that test a player's imagination. Tomorrow at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $33 to $45, $10 for listeners under 25.  KOZINN    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC The orchestra is kicking off a monthlong festival that seems on the surface something of a grab-bag but may make sense in the end. It is titled ''Visions of the Beyond,'' after Messiaen's ''Éclairs sur l'Au-Delà,'' which comes later, and includes works as diverse as Bach's ''Art of Fugue'' and Gyorgy Ligeti's ''Atmosphères.'' But it starts here with Mendelssohn's incidental music for ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' with a semistaged performance of excerpts from the play, directed by Edward Berkeley. Neville Marriner cionducts, and the cast includes Campbell Scott, Marcia Gay Harden and Hope Davis. The start of something big? Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90.  OESTREICH    ORPHEUS This conductorless chamber orchestra devotes its Sunday evening concert in the Medieval Sculpture Court of the Metropolitan Museum to sacred works. The program's centerpiece is Pergolesi's Stabat Mater -- a setting that (along with Pergolesi himself for undertaking it) was disparaged by Stravinsky, but is lovely all the same. Also on the bill are some of Salamone Rossi's magnificent Psalm settings, in Hebrew. The vocal soloists are Christine Brandes, soprano, and Beth Clayton, mezzo-soprano. Sunday at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $50.  KOZINN    'SOLOMON' Handel's oratorio about the great biblical king touches on several of the principal episodes of his reign -- the visit of the Queen of Sheba, whose arrival is accompanied by some of this score's most famous music, for example, and the incident in which two women claim a single baby as their own. Johannes Somary and his Amor Artis Chamber Choir are known for their fine performances of the Handel oratorios, and tonight they offer ''Solomon'' with the support of a period instrument orchestra. The soloists include Terrence Barber as Solomon; Michael Steinberger as Zadok the Priest, Julianne Baird as the Queen of Sheba, and Cynthia Richards Wallace as Solomon's Queen -- or one of them; Handel didn't take into account that he had roughly 1,000 of them. Ms. Baird and Ms. Wallace also portray the baby-disputing harlots. Tonight at 8, Church of the Blessed Sacrament, 152 West 71st Street, (212)874-4513. Tickets: $20, $15 for students and 62+.  KOZINN    TRIGON STRING TRIO Miller Theater and the Trigon String Trio are attempting to pick up where Mozart left off. The composer took portions of Bach's trio sonatas (written for organ) and arranged them for violin, viola and cello. In three concerts over the course of this season, this ensemble will offer all six trio sonatas as string trios. Tonight's concert, the second in the series, will also feature a Mozart Divertimento (K. 563). Tonight at 8, Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $25.  EICHLER    ZEHETMAIR TRIO This ensemble is usually a fine string quartet led by the resourceful Austrian violinist Thomas Zehetmair, but the group has been traveling as a trio since Matthias Metzger, the second violinist, withdrew from its current tour due to illness. The reconfigured program includes Schubert's great B-flat Major String Trio as well as works by Mozart and Gideon Klein. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $30 to $42.

BAX 2005 WOMEN'S PERFORMANCE FESTIVAL This celebration of performing-arts work by women features dance by Jen Abrams and theater by Amy Jo Goddard (tonight and tomorrow) and Marlies Yearby and her Movin' Spirits Dance Theater (Sunday). Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m., Brooklyn Arts Exchange (BAX), 421 Fifth Avenue at Eighth Street, Park Slope, (718)832-0018 or www.bax.org Tickets: $8 to $15.  JENNIFER DUNNING    ALEXANDRA BELLER AND ALETHEA ADSITT Ms. Beller has moved on from danced Chekhov to Sartre and his ''No Exit,'' set to a soundscore by Robert Poss with a set filled with green balloons. Her characters are a frustrated Broadway diva in a scuba suit, a murderous debutante, a murdered pacifist and a tap-dancing lesbian. Ms. Adsitt has settled for exploring how humans absorb and navigate a hyper-urban environment, in her new ''Blink: The Indelible Blue Wall Coda.'' Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., the Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)253-8899. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    * PETER BOAL & COMPANY Mr. Boal, who will take over the directorship of the Pacific Northwest Ballet in the fall, is going out with a bang in this final New York City program by his own small company. To start, the dancers include him, the exquisite Wendy Whelan and the young City Ballet up-and-comers Andrew Veyette and Sean Suozzi. The repertory includes world premieres by Edwaard Liang, Victor Quijada and Shen Wei, Daniel Nagrin's classic ''Strange Hero'' and a dance by Wendy Perron. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800 or www.joyce.org. Tickets: $42.  DUNNING    CLARE BYRNE AND AMY LARIMER We're shy about telling you the title, which could be misinterpreted, for this raunchy-sounding piece about ''dance-world jaded lizards.'' The part-dance, part situation-comedy work will be presented on a program shared with the performance-artist Sara Juli. Tonight at 8., Dixon Place, 258 Bowery between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212)219-0736. Tickets: $12; $10, students at 65+  DUNNING    ERICA ESSNER PERFORMANCE CO-OP Ms. Essner has been praised for her fine-scaled expressionism. Her subjects here include men dancing in America, meditation and chaos, isolation in a crowd and contorted shapes (in a dance set to tango music). Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479. Tickets: $15; $12 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    FRIDAYS AT NOON This informal free talk-and-dance series will focus this weekend on new dances by Jordan Fuchs, Leah Kreutzer and Eryc Taylor. Today at noon, 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, Lexington Avenue at 92nd Street, Manhattan, (212)415-5500.  DUNNING    KATE GYLLENHAAL/MO CO Thoughts of home have influenced the dances on this program, all choreographed by Ms. Gyllenhaal. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers Street, (212)220-1460. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    'I LOVE TANGO' This ''tango musical'' boasts four dancers and live string, bandoneon, piano and vocal music. Through March 27. Tonight and tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 729-3880. Tickets: $30; $27 for students and 65+ ; $25 (Thursdays).  DUNNING    MOB PRODUCTIONS AND ROBBINSCHILDS Two groups offer a double feature of premieres. Mollie O'Brien's ''This Is What I Would Have Felt,'' for her company, MOB Productions, uses the body to express sensations of illness that may be verbally indescribable. ''Half Space,'' by Sonya Robbins and Layla Childs depicts empty places, public spaces and imagined time travel with the aid of carpet runners, piles of chairs and a big chandelier. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077. Tickets: $20. (Related review, Page Page 3.)  JACK ANDERSON    NAYIKAS DANCE THEATER Billing itself as New York's first resident dance theater company specializing in the Indian classical Odissi form, the troupe will perform the director Myna Mukherjee's ''Glow,'' a new multimedia dance and theater piece that draws on the glowing sensuality of women. Tonight at 7 p.m. and tomorrow at 3 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344. Tickets: $25; $18 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    PEARSONWIDRIG DANCE THEATER Sara Pearson and Patrik Widrig, who have been dancing and creating choreographic journeys together for more than 20 years, offer the world premiere of ''Thaw,'' an evocation of the ill-fated 1914 Antarctic expedition of the explorer Ernest Shackleton. They venture to the South Pole with the aid of recorded bird calls, documentary film footage and actual pieces of ice. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $20. (Related review, Page 4.)  ANDERSON    SOWETO STREET BEAT This all-male troupe of dancers, singers and musicians came originally from the streets of Johannesburg. They've kept the spirit alive in ''Zulu Kingdom,'' complete with a traditional gumboot dance. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Brooklyn Center at Brooklyn College, one block from the junction of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, (718)951-4600. Tickets: $30.  DUNNING    * PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY In its closing weekend, the company is presenting one of its best programs tonight, when Mr. Taylor's wonderfully humane, closet-pyrotechnians will dance his powerful and haunting ''Last Look,'' his sly ''Cloven Kingdom'' and his delectably goofy ''Offenbach Overtures.'' Two Taylor classics (''Aureole'' and ''3 Epitaphs'') will be performed tomorrow night on a program that also includes a season premiere (''Dante Variations). The other premiere will be performed on Sunday on a program that ends with another Taylor classic, ''Esplanade.'' Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-1212. Tickets: $15 to $75.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression, the emotions that reveal themselves after her best pictures leave their first impression, which is often alarm. She captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and -- this probably applies as much to Arbus as to any other photographer of the second half of the last century -- she captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some maddeningly dark, dense and absurdly theatrical galleries, like chapels, of memorabilia. That said, touches her favorite subjects with grace. Even the shocking photographs of retarded women are sympathetic, implying that the world is full of wondrous things, if our eyes are open enough to recognize them, and that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; students, $7 and 65+, $10.  MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    'BASQUIAT,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)683-5000, through June 5. In the 1980's, the hyper-talented Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-1988) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame, usually on the same surface. His loquacious, ugly-elegant ''letters to the world'' (Emily Dickinson's phrase), were in step with the 80's interest in collage and in redirecting the avant-garde strategies of Post-Minimalism into painting. But Basquiat also had an urgent subject: blackness, whose glories, histories and pain his art elucidates with extraordinary complexity, in volatile mixtures of ideas, emotions, colors and images that expand the viewer's experience of time and space. This generous retrospective has a few glitches -- too many works borrowed from too few collections and a slightly too empty look in some galleries -- but nothing really detracts from its power. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  ROBERTA SMITH    * THOMAS DEMAND, Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9400, through May 30. A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, so as to take his own cinematic photographs. He is really a sculptor, making models of places, to produce pictures that have the presence of paintings. His subject is more than just photography's inherent unreliability, its slipperiness as truth. It also entails memory. He has reconstructed, from photographs, the blown-up room where plotters failed to kill Hitler, and the studio of an artist whom Baader-Meinhof terrorists assaulted during the 1970's in order to blow up the house of a prosecutor who lived next door. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students; children 16 and under and accompanied by an adult, free. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m. Hours and admission: see above.  KIMMELMAN    * TIM HAWKINSON, Whitney Museum of American Art, Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212)570-3676, through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Tim Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, sprawling in no obvious order across the museum's fourth floor, hopscotches from one dexterous tour-de-force to the next. Each requires some head-scratching decipherment, inviting admiration for its doggedness, while not straining too hard to earn a viewer's love. Feats of physical fancy, when so dizzily executed, can be their own justification. Mr. Hawkinson's larger purpose, you might say, is simply wonderment. At the same time the art borrows a healthy strain of ludicrous wit from Samuel Beckett, who knew a thing or two about how to clown around smartly. Hours: Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Friday 1 to 9 p.m.; closed Monday and Tuesday. Admission: $12; 62+, $9.50; New York City students with valid ID and children 11 and under, free.  KIMMELMAN    * 'PETER PAUL RUBENS (1577-1640): THE DRAWINGS,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through April 3. The show is sublime. It makes not the slightest difference that it has no grand thesis, provides no narrative arc, offers up a few newly discovered drawings and fresh, solid scholarship but no radical twist on the artist. If there is any artistic justice, the exhibition ought to inspire the sort of mobbish devotion that the Met show of Leonardo's drawings did two years ago. Reviewing the work seems a bit silly. What is there to say, except that the drawings illustrate the limits of what is humanly possible with a piece of chalk and a pen and paper? It is profoundly heartening. Rubens loved to draw and loved that he could draw like a god, and his joy is ours, in looking at what he drew. This includes a few drawings by other artists with which Rubens fussed, sticking in angels here, touching up a beard there. Rubens regarded drawings, other people's and his own, as organic, to be learned from and endlessly improved upon, like life. Hours and admission: See above.  KIMMELMAN    Galleries: Uptown    NINA MUSHINSKY, Janos Gat, 1100 Madison Avenue, between 82nd and 83rd Streets, (212)327-0441, through April 2. Ms. Mushinsky is a New York-based painter who makes labor intensive, all black and white pictures based on photographs she has taken in Central Europe. Her paintings of subjects like an antique dress in a history museum, a bleak highway ramp or blurry laughing people in a leafy backyard can take as long as two years to complete. They have a smudgy, dreamlike hyperreality.  KEN JOHNSON    Galleries: 57th Street    SIDNEY GEIST: 'PHASES OF SCULPTURE,' Jason McCoy, Inc., 41 East 57th Street, (212)319-1996, through April 1. In work that goes back to the 1930's, Mr. Geist -- a sculptor as well as a teacher and writer noted for his studies of Brancusi -- has reached out to many different cultures and individuals for inspiration, from tribal art to Picasso and David Smith. The show is populated by tall, totemic structures of carved and painted wood, including a bosomy bright red ''Goddess,'' 8 1/2 feet high, but there are many smaller works like ''Rise,'' a biomorphic, Arp-esque piece of two sensuous curves, one smaller than the other, joined by a narrow isthmus. Brancusi is most significantly saluted in ''Homage Without End,'' a tall, skinny piece in raw wood whose title and structure of repetitive modules derive from the sculptor's series of ''Endless Columns.'' Mr. Geist has tried his hand at a forest of styles without ever arriving at a distinctive ''signature'' mode. Is that bad? No. Credit him with the fervor of an explorer.  GRACE GLUECK    NANCY GRAVES: 'A RETROSPECTIVE,' Ameringer & Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212)445-0051, through April 2. Graves, who died of cancer 10 years ago, first drew attention in the late 60's for her life-size, hyper-realistic camels. This retrospective includes a prehistoric camel skull and spine from the period that was later cast in bronze. The most convincing work remains the airy, playfully disjunctive and colorfully and loosely painted assemblages of the 80's made of found objects cast in bronze, including parts of plants, mechanical fragments, tools and food products.  JOHNSON    R. B. KITAJ: 'HOW TO REACH 72 IN A JEWISH ART,' Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900, through April 2. Mr. Kitaj's overpopulated mess of an exhibition is as interesting as it is exasperating. His ongoing visual autobiography tracks his life as a Jewish intellectual, eccentric Modernist and wild old man with Biblical white hair and beard in erotic encounters with pretty young women. The subject matter is intriguing but it is realized in drawings and paintings with such sketchy impatience you wish he'd just slow down and paint nothing but still-lifes for a while.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    'BODY PROXY: AN EXHIBITION BY NORMA JEANE,' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through March 26. Norma Jeane is the fictive persona in whose name a group of anonymous people produce works of conceptual art. This show includes a motorcycle that starts up and roars increasingly loudly as you approach; a 100 kilometer long strand of hair on a spool made by knotting together hairs from one person's head; and a round, flesh-colored sofa said to be saturated with sexually provocative pheromones that will get into your clothes if you sit on it.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    'JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT: IN WORDS ONLY,' Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through March 26. This excellent show concentrates on the cornerstones of Basquiat's art: language and a blocky, concise handwriting that amounts to a personal, almost digital typeface. The only images here are words, names, lists and phrases, often appropriated from odd places, like the index of a book on jazz or the title of a painting by Ter Borch. One nine-sheet work is simply a rewriting of the prolonged table of contents of ''Moby-Dick,'' suggesting a kind of poem.  SMITH    CHRISTIAN MOELLER: 'HEAVEN,' Frederieke Taylor, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-0992, through March 12. A professor of design/media arts at the University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Moeller is known internationally for interactive sound, light and architectural installations. Here he presents a comparatively simple installation of fluorescent light works in which shadowy words like heaven, goat, lick, tryst and vodka emerge mysteriously from banks of thin, white parallel tubes. It is literally the brightest show in town.  JOHNSON    'KA/VH:RA/AG,' Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)255-0979, through March 26. It's always good news when artists like work that doesn't resemble theirs. Thus, the motley appearance of this four-person exhibition, which resulted when two 5BE artists -- Richard Aldrich and Kamrooz Aram -- each invited another artist to show with them. But Mr. Aram's sly, lush recyclings of decorative and religious Persian, Chinese and Christian motifs share with Van Hanos's relatively Gothic vision an interest in mystical power and paint's physicality. And Mr. Aldrich's fragmentary abstract drawings share a studied, 1970s-based nonchalance (and, here, a darkened space) with the Amy Granat's film installation, which uses scratched film and scratchier sound to reshape space, and is the show's standout.  SMITH    IMRE KINSZKI, Klotz/Sirmon, 511 West 25th Street, (212)741-4764, through March 26. Born in Budapest in 1901, Kinszki was a well-connected Modernist photographer whose works could stand up with pictures by more famous Hungarian peers like Andre Kertesz, Brassai and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. The tiny, velvety contact prints from the 20's and 30's in this show are formally exquisite and often emotionally poignant. They include a monumental close-up of chess pieces; studies of buildings and shadows; and a heartbreakingly lovely picture of a sleeping baby. Kinszki never left Hungary, and he died in a concentration camp in 1945.  JOHNSON    CHERYL LAEMMLE, R. Duane Reed, 529 West 20th Street, (212)462-2600, through April 2. People who were around in the 80's may remember Ms. Laemmle's zany paintings of humanoid figures made of white birch logs. This exciting comeback show, the artist's first in New York since 1994, presents weirdly elegant paintings of strangely distorted cartoon birds, predatory cats and children perched on tree branches. The imagery looks like it was lifted from an antique children's book, and it is painted with an economical yet sensuous touch on unprimed linen.  JOHNSON    CORNELIA RENZ, Goff + Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212)675-0461, through April 16. This Berlin-based artist draws large, provocative cartoon images of chubby, exotically costumed young girls with adult characteristics of sexuality and aggression. Ms. Renz draws with felt-tip markers on both sides of big sheets of acrylic glass as well as on underlying white panels, creating much linear complexity. And she encloses her pictures appropriately in clinical white plastic frames of her own devising.  JOHNSON    LARRY ZOX: 'FIVE DECADES,' Stephen Haller Gallery, 542 West 26th Street, (212)741-7777, through April 5. Larry Zox's distinctive, color-drenched hard-edge canvases that made a splash in the Color Field movement of the 1960's form the bulk of this mini-retrospective, which covers his work from the late 50's to now. The signature 60's work, revealing his association with the group that included Frank Stella and Kenneth Noland, was based on a tricky geometrical scheme involving the interplay of diamonds and diagonals, which he worked with many variations and impressive results. His technique has since become much freer, and in his most recent, more emotive work color seems more important than structure.  GLUECK    Other Galleries    PETER CAINE: 'DOMO ARIGATO, MR. ROBOTO,' Jack the Pelican, 487 Driggs Avenue, Brooklyn, (718)782-0183, through March 27. There is something to offend if not necessarily amuse everyone in Mr. Caine's hyperkinetic exhibition of electronically animated mannequins and crude handmade effigies. His obscenely activated and often talking representations include a warty, porcine policeman; President Bush and a monstrous green extraterrestrial; a picnic of Nazi schoolgirls; a scatological Sister Wendy and lots more.  JOHNSON    'ANDY MESSERSCHMIDT: HOODWINKERS, FAUXS, IMPOSTORS AND SNAKEOILERS,' Plane Space, 102 Charles Street, West Village, (917)606-1268, through March 27. The deception alluded to in this exhibition's title may reflect that the bright, patterned paintings turn out to be elaborate combinations of doilies, lace, fabric, plus well-placed paint. Their intensely decorative, symmetrical intricacies and occasional excursions into delicate drawing are all a little too current. But 45 watercolor collages, each 10 inches square, while more conservative, suggest that the artist, a 2002 M.F.A. from the University of Minnesota, has other options.  SMITH    Last Chance    CHINATSU BAN, Marianne Boesky Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)680-9889, closing tomorrow. Brightly colored underpants drift through the air, are worn by little girls and their boxy guardian elephants in the slightly-too-sweet paintings and sculpture with which this talented young Japanese artist is making her New York debut. Possibly demonic apple halves occasionally threaten, and the total effect is of a freshened up mythology. All is enhanced by the artist's delicate but assured painting skills, which suggest an uncanny, intuitive fusion of Color Field painting, Japanese screens, Paul Klee and Indian miniatures.  SMITH    ALISON FOX, ATM Gallery, 170 Avenue B near 10th Street, East Village, (212)375-0349, closing on Sunday. The clunky abstracted still lifes, pervaded by an interest in the textile arts, that fill this young New York artist's first solo make capable although hardly groundbreaking use of familiar quantities, operating in terrain bordered by Dana Schutz, Jessica Stockholder and the British painter Howard Hodgkin. She is at her best in ham-handed Cubistic works like ''Voodoo Lady'' and ''Johanna's Party'' whose crowded colors, impastos, wet-on-wet flourishes and overlapping forms seem to cry out for a larger surface. Luckily they seldom get it.  SMITH    ROBERT MORRIS: 'SMALL FIRES AND MNEMONIC NIGHTS,' Leo Castelli, 18 East 77th Street, (212)249-4470, closing tomorrow. The co-founder of Minimalism's surprising new, easel-size encaustic paintings look like they were made by Edward Hopper under the influence of Magritte and de Chirico. Images of nocturnal, moonlit rooms with fires and explosions in the distance convey feelings of loneliness and grief; and images of public sites like \\"Boys Room\\" or \\"Union Station\\" are like places from the artist's own past revisited in dreams.  JOHNSON    LANE TWITCHELL: 'HERE & THERE,' Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, closing tomorrow. Mr. Twitchell continues to produce astoundingly intricate patterns by folding and cutting into sheets of paper as large as six feet square. Close examination discovers all kinds of cultural signifiers and underpainting and overpainting enhance the complication. The only problem is the greasy-looking resin in which the cut-outs are submerged; there must be a better way to preserve and protect Mr. Twitchell's wonderfully delicate and expansive filigree.  JOHNSON    JOHN WALKER: 'COLLAGE,' Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212)794-0550, closing tomorrow. This English artist who now lives in Maine produced the six powerfully imposing Cubist collages featured here while living and teaching in New York in the mid-70's. Each measures 10 by 8 feet and has leathery surfaces of painted, irregularly cut-up pieces of canvas. Today they seem old fashioned, even a little academic. Still, the rumbling, viscerally physical energy they exude remains exciting.  JOHNSON   The Listings"},{"year":"2005","title":"THE stalls at local farmers' markets are filling out like cornfields in July. Each week there are more choices, even more farmers. As you plow through the crowds and rustle through the greens, you might want a little help focusing. Here it is. These purveyors at local farmers' markets are among the best. Most bring crops to market month after month. But each has a specialty worth trying at the peak of its season. For each, the tale of what brought them to market is slightly different. Exact market locations and times are at www.cenyc.org, www.nyfarmersmarket.com and www.communitymarkets.biz.    Italian Seeds That Flourished in New York Soil    Ken Migliorelli's grandfather Rocco brought broccoli rabe seeds with him when he immigrated from the Lazio region of Italy, and planted them at the family's first farm, in the Bronx. ''In 1933, where Co-op City is now, it was all farmland,'' said Mr. Migliorelli, who now farms about 300 acres in Tivoli, N.Y. ''We lost that farm, but my dad brought the seeds upstate and I'm still growing exactly the same strain as my grandfather did.'' Dark, pungent broccoli rabe is not a kind of broccoli -- it's more closely related to the turnip (the Italian term is cime di rape, meaning turnip tops).    AVAILABLE -- Will be in markets in July, then absent for August and back again after Labor Day. (Broccoli rabe dislikes very hot weather.)    SELECTING -- Not all broccoli rabe has florets. Look for perky, dark green stems and leaves. Yellow flowers connote freshness, but yellow leaves are a sign of age.    STORING -- Lasts well but does not improve in the refrigerator. ''The sooner you cook it, the less bitter it is,'' Mr. Migliorelli says.    KITCHEN TIP -- In the Migliorelli family, broccoli rabe is always cooked for at least 20 or 30 minutes. ''Coat the bottom of a pot with oil, add a couple of minced garlic cloves and let it simmer. Then add the wet broccoli, cover the pot, and cook it down until it's soft. It should never be al dente.''

LAFARGE SHOW     Opening today and running through Jan. 6 at the Hudson River Museum is an exhibition of the watercolors and drawings of John LaFarge, the American artist who died in 1910.    The son of French emigres to the United States, he was born in New York City and grew up in a cultured, secure atmosphere that he was unable to sustain for himself as an adult. When he died at the age of 67 he owed his creditors $500,000 and he had endured a prolonged, painful and self-imposed separation from his wife and children.    He studied law and architecture, but a Grand Tour of Europe as a young man kindled an appetite for painting that persisted for the rest of his life. His reputation was established in the 1870's and 80's, when he designed the interior decorations for Trinity Church in Boston, and stained-glass windows for several New York City churches including St. Thomas's, St. Peter's and the Brick Church.    In this exhibition are a number of watercolors painted during a visit to the South Seas. Among them, \\"Diadem Mountain at Sunset, Tahiti\\" and \\"Pass and Peak of Vaiaroa, Taiarapu\\" are considered to be some of his best work. Illustrations he created for books of poetry include \\"The Spirit of the Water-Lily\\" from Abby Sage Richardson's \\"Songs From the Old Dramatists.\\" The water lily was a recurring theme in his work.    The museum is open Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.","excerpt":"Thursdays from 10 A.M. to 9 P.M., and Sundays from noon to 5 P.M.

Mostly traditional printmaking methods are used and the choices are fairly conservative at the contemporary end. So Sylvia Plimack Mangold's drypoint and etching ''Maple Tree'' (1998), for instance, a close-up rendering of intersecting bare-tree branches, keeps good company with William Delamotte's etching of almost 200 years earlier, ''Beech in Windsor Forest.''

This crystalline, elegantly installed exhibition outlines a tale of artistic osmosis, assimilation and transformation: the wide and complex swath that the Greek vase, as both object and motif, cut through the culture of 17th-century Europe. The influence of the vase echoes through silver wine coolers and coffee pots, painted overdoor panels, the inlaid decorations of a lady's desk and prints that satirize the rage for things classical. But the most exciting elements are the actual Greek vases themselves and the ones they inspired, beginning with Josiah Wedgwood's innovative, relatively austere jasperware and including the full-blown extravagance of the royal French porcelain works at Sèvres. The show is the first collaboration between the students at the Bard Graduate Center and the Met's formidable European decorative arts department. It should become a regular habit.

To Plains Indians of the 18th and 19th centuries, magnificently decorated hide shirts were symbols of bravery earned only by the most courageous in battle.

Celebrating the power of this glory gear, almost 50 dazzlers in the museum's collection are on view, dating from about 1820 to the 1990's. Among the more fascinating examples are a brilliantly painted Crow shirt (1890) with beadwork in geometric patterns and frizzy fringes of dyed magenta and yellow hair, and a Lakota shirt, circa 1890, that sports United States Army insignia, the American flag and stepped tepees topped by crosses, all worked in porcupine quills and metal beads.

Museums    ''THE AMERICAN CENTURY: ART AND CULTURE, PART 2: 1950-2000,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 13). Filling the museum's six floors, this complicated, conflicted exhibition once more demonstrates the difficulty of mounting sweepingly inclusive exhibitions with no discernible point of view. It displays hundreds of works in dozens of mediums expertly placed in contexts that constantly pull one's attention outward, toward the show's flickering edges: landmark events, famous personalities, banned or controversial books, emblematic snippets of film, song and television and even the ephemeral. But these do not disguise a discouragingly conventional core and the predictable, severely truncated story told by the objects on view. The many great works in the show's first half tend to be overly familiar because they are mostly drawn from the museum's collection. Moving toward the present, the works become weaker, the choices of artists arbitrary, the sense of history increasingly confused and the absence of non-American artists more and more glaring. Ultimately one senses not an ''American Century'' or even half-century but two decades, the 1950's and 60's, during which American art -- seen in isolation -- held its ground. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.","excerpt":"Thursdays, 1 to 8 p.m. Closed Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Admission: $12.50; $10.50 for students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).    * ''THE ARTIST AS COLLECTOR: MASTERPIECES FROM THE C. C. WANG FAMILY COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 9). The painter and collector C. C. Wang, now 92, has amassed one of the world's premier private collections of Chinese old master paintings. This show gives some idea of the treasures he has sold and those he still holds. Included are 60 pieces in the Met's permanent holdings, along with 12 recent arrivals and loans from Mr. Wang. Much of the material is familiar; this is basically a rotation of the museum's permanent collection, with additions. But much is not, and the total impact is impressive. Especially interesting in a show based on the theme of connoisseurship is the presence, front and center, of a colossal scroll that arrived at the Met two years ago as an exceedingly rare 10th-century work but that a prominent art historian has called a 20th-century forgery. The Met is convinced it has the genuine article and offers substantial evidence. Judge for yourself. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Closed Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Suggested admission: $10 for adults; $5 for students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).    * ''BERLIN METROPOLIS: JEWS AND THE NEW CULTURE, 1890-1918,'' Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through April 23). A show that should be a required course in every New Yorker's education: our cosmopolitan tradition, our appetite for novelty and change spring partly from seeds planted a century ago in Berlin. Though it highlights the part played by Jews, the story it tells could be the story of all outsiders who gravitate toward cities in search of meaning. With more than 200 paintings, stage designs, sheet-music covers, gallery catalogs, photographs, sculptures and other objects, it covers the years when modernism took root: in galleries, publishing houses and theaters, in advanced art from France and Italy, in the rich street life of newspapers, cafes and shop windows. Given the revolutionary temper of the art, the presentation is surprisingly understated, and this adds enormously to the show's power. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., Tuesdays until 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students and the elderly (Herbert Muschamp).    * ''A CENTURY OF DESIGN, PART I: 1900-1925,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, (through March 26). This exquisite sampling of 20th-century design objects from the Met's own collection covers the years 1900-1925 and the three major design currents of the period: Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau and Art Deco. More than 50 examples of furniture, metalwork, glass, ceramics, textiles, jewelry and drawings are on view, from a fanciful Pompeian-style dressing table of bronze and basalt by the French designer Armand-Albert Rateau to a silver claret jug with sinuous curves and flyaway thumbpiece, the work of the English craftsman Archibald Knox. The show, more a salute than a full-scale survey, is the first of four, extending well into 2001, that will cover the entire 20th century. Installed in several intimate galleries of the 20th-century department, it proves once again that the Met can mount a boutique show with as much panache as a five-alarm blockbuster. Hours and admission: See above (Grace Glueck).    * ''BODY ART: MARKS OF IDENTITY,'' American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100 (through May 29). The theme of this smart, entertaining, globe-spanning show is personal adornment of the most intimate kind, including tattooing, piercing and scarification. The packed installation offers just enough bare multicultural flesh to inspire rubbernecking without actually being an adults-only affair. Most interesting is the way art and anthropology are seamlessly brought together. Greek vases and African hairpins, ethnic postcards and Indian miniatures, Victorian corsets, Amazonian nose plugs and contemporary neo-tribal body work from New York share the limelight. It all makes fascinating sense, and a family-style museum gets to looks sexy in the bargain. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 8:45 p.m. Closed Christmas Day. Admission: $8; $6, students and the elderly; $4.50, children (Cotter).    * ''CELEBRATING THE AMERICAN WING,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 81st Street, (212) 535-7710 (works on paper through March 26; other acquisitions through Nov. 12, 2000). The 75th anniversary of the American Wing, the first permanent installation of early American decorative arts and architecture in an American museum, is commemorated with an extensive show of five-star acquisitions made since 1980. (That was the year the wing got a makeover and expansion.) Paintings, drawings, sculptures, textiles, furniture, ceramics, period rooms and things more difficult to classify come within the wing's capacious reach, and its newer prizes, shown in context with older works in the collection, include a dazzling 19th-century quilt incorporating world-famous signatures, a lively early watercolor by Winslow Homer of two small boys with a hoard of clams, a fine group of miniature paintings on ivory, a pair of lavishly gilded card tables by the early-19th-century cabinetmaker Charles-Honore Lannuier and a Colt revolver with gold inlaid scrollwork and a bust of George Washington set into the cylinder. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).    ''CLEMENTE,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3800 (through Jan. 12). The youngest artist to be given the full-rotunda treatment, the Italian neo-Expressionist Francesco Clemente has filled the place with a large (maybe too large), unruly multimedia survey. Full of dreamy East-meets-West images that delve into the mind, the body and many forms of love, the show reveals him to be a 1980's star for the 90's. His receptive, anything-goes sensibility and constant movement among New York, India and Italy have resulted in an astounding range of style, media and working processes. The more than 400 works on view include Expressionist oils and dreamy pastels, pale frescos and taut, Indian-style miniatures and works involving handmade paper, the best of which are influenced by Indian movie posters. The nonchronological order of the exhibition obscures any sense of Mr. Clemente's emblematic development out of late 70's Conceptual Art and disguises the fact that his best work was done in the early 80's, when neo-Expressionism was in its feverish heyday. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, until 8 p.m. Closed Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Admission: $12; $7 for students and the elderly (Smith).    ''DOUBLE VISION: STAN DOUGLAS AND DOUGLAS GORDON,'' Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through March 4). This exhibition juxtaposes two video projection pieces in which juxtaposition is all, and the technical explanation is almost more interesting than the work itself. Mr. Gordon divides the frames of ''Whirlpool,'' a film noir directed by Otto Preminger, between two reels, converts them to video and projects them side by side, with the right-hand projection reversed. The result is a strobelike pulsing of sound and image and a fantastic formal array of symmetrical patterns, sliding planes and kaleidoscopic motion, with plot reduced to a sideshow pantomime. In ''Win, Place or Show,'' Mr. Douglas has filmed and refilmed a six-minute exchange of words and then blows between two men who share a modernistic apartment in a big anonymous complex, shooting it from different angles, with slight changes in dialogue, props and blocking. Projecting double images of the same scene shot from different angles, he creates a disjunction so peculiar and confusing that the viewer, struggling to keep track of the changes, becomes an instant deconstructionist, parsing the scene word by word and move by move until the whole thing threatens to disintegrate. Both pieces are tours de force of a very cerebral kind. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Closed Christmas Eve Day and Christmas Day, New Year's Eve Day and New Year's Day. Admission: $6; $3, students and the elderly (Smith).    * ''EGYPTIAN ART IN THE AGE OF THE PYRAMIDS,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 9). Getting the early vote for blockbuster of the fall season, this is one of those spectacles, like the Byzantine, Chinese and Mexican surveys the Met has done in recent years, that are not only about art but also a whole civilization. It examines the 500 years between 2650 B.C. and 2150 B.C., the period of the Old Kingdom. Considering the number and popularity of exhibitions about New Kingdom pharaohs like Tutankhamen and Amenhotep III, it is a little surprising that this is the first big survey devoted to what is really the high point of all ancient Egyptian culture. Hours and admission: See above (Michael Kimmelman).    * ''EASTMAN JOHNSON: PAINTING AMERICA,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Feb. 6). If he wasn't the most exciting painter, Johnson (1824-1906) was a solid one, whose mix of corny stereotype and original observation was heavily influenced by 17th-century Dutch genre painting. His narrative focus encompassed rural and domestic life, women, children and old men, and a group of important African-American subjects. Although his name is now overshadowed by Winslow Homer and Thomas Eakins, for two decades (1860-1880) he was the leading figure painter in the United States. His boldest endeavor before and during the Civil War was painting antislavery scenes, like the powerful ''Ride for Liberty -- The Fugitive Slaves'' (circa 1862). After the war he became noted for his domestic interiors and scenes of rural life. This show is a worthy tribute to an artist who fused home-grown talent with European training to convey a well-varnished vision of 19th-century America. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.  Closed Christmas Day; open New Year's Day from 5 to 11 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students; $1.50 for the elderly (Glueck).    ''MODERN STARTS: PEOPLE, PLACES AND THINGS,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (''People'' through Feb. 1; the rest, March 14). The first of the Modern's millennial museumwide extravaganzas, this flawed, courageous and unprecedented exhibition is a sweeping but episodic view of the inexorable drift toward the modern that began in the mid-19th century. It organizes more than 600 works from the museum's vaunted collection every which way but chronological: by medium, subject, geography, artistic strategy and so on. The results are confusing, unwieldy, jarringly arbitrary in some areas, tediously repetitious in others and appallingly short on female artists. There are some exciting departures: a small gallery comparing the satiric, death-haunted prints of James Ensor and Jose Guadalupe Posada, a ravishing if more predictable homage to French landscape and a persistent attention to photography. Picasso's ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' is installed as if it were just another great painting, not the first instance of nuclear fission. ''Things'' looks the best because it mixes its media the most thoroughly. But if the drummer is different, many of the marchers remain the same: Cezanne, Picasso and Matisse appear throughout, and nearly all paintings are French. The speculative nature of the show is refreshing, but its ideas are almost never pushed far enough. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays and on Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Holiday hours: 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. this Wednesday. Closed Christmas Day; open New Year's Day from 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50 for students and the elderly (Smith).    * ''ONLY THE BEST: MASTERPIECES OF THE CALOUSTE GULBENKIAN MUSEUM, LISBON,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, 82nd Street at Fifth Avenue, (212) 879-5500 (through Feb. 27). A Turkish-born Armenian oil millionaire who spent most of his adult life in Europe, Gulbenkian (1869-1955) was as eclectic in his aesthetic tastes as he was focused on quality. He bought, he scrutinized, he de-accessioned: ending up with one of the century's greatest collections, 80 of whose 5,000 objects are in this show. Organized in alternating groups of fine and decorative arts, it nearly covers the cultural glove, with mostly outstanding examples. The decorative holdings include Turkish and Islamic ceramics and textiles, jaw-dropping examples of 18th-century French silver and a selection of jewelry by Rene Lalique. Alternating with these are Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities, medieval and Renaissance paintings, including a stunning portrait of a young woman by Ghirlandaio and one great painting each by Rubens, Fragonard, Manet and Degas. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).    * ''PORTRAITS BY INGRES: IMAGE OF AN EPOCH,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 2). This luxurious show includes several dozen drawings by Ingres along with his greatest portrait paintings. There is something almost inhuman about them. Technique on Ingres's level is spooky. The most touching thing about his art in general is the degree to which it survives under the impossible pressure of his expectations. The exhibition ends, in a shimmer of satin and jewels, with the late portraits of Mme. Moitessier, Vicomtesse d'Haussonville and Princesse Albert de Broglie, and with his last work, a calculatedly simple self-portrait, which he finished in 1865, two years before he died, at 87. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).    * JOHN SINGER SARGENT, ''Portraits of the Wertheimer Family,'' Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Feb. 6). A reunion of a dozen Sargent portraits, commissioned by the wealthy Jewish art dealer Asher Wertheimer. The ensemble hung in the family's London home, but the bequest of nine of them to the National Portrait Gallery in the 1920's aroused the ire of British worthies, who felt they didn't belong in a museum devoted to exalted Britons. Most of the portraits were eventually consigned to storage at the Tate Gallery. The show's catalog raises interesting issues: the position of Jews in English society and to what degree Sargent stressed his friends' Jewishness, given the slight edge of caricature and stereotype that he conferred on many of his portrait subjects. Most of the paintings give a wonderful account of Sargent's bold brushwork and his talent for finding and projecting his subjects' individuality. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).    ''SENSATION: YOUNG BRITISH ARTISTS FROM THE SAATCHI COLLECTION,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 9). As is almost always the case in culture wars, the event that provokes the skirmish turns out to be much less entertaining and far less significant than the political fight. This exhibition will be a huge disappointment to anyone expecting true shock. You're obliged to go anyway if you want to be able to say that you saw what all the fuss was about. The paradox of the culture wars is that they have made celebrities out of artists who would otherwise vanish. This may be the best argument, in the end, for unfettered freedom of expression. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).    ''TIME TRACED: RODNEY GRAHAM AND VERA LUTTER,'' Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 19). This show contrasts large black-and-white photographs by Rodney Graham with those of Vera Lutter. Mr. Graham's large-format images of magnificently ancient trees are inverted, imitating the effect of the rudimentary camera obscura. The mind struggles to make sense of them: the trees suggest giant root systems or reflections while also adding to a landscape tradition that stretches from 17th-century Dutch painting to the photographs of Atget. Ms. Lutter works with specially built pinhole cameras, making photographs of vast urban industrial sites that seem abandoned. The images are in their original negative state, which pushes them further into a silvery twilight zone. An empty factory, a German zeppelin hanger and New York City's giant Pepsi-Cola sign shot from the Queens side are seen in ghostly irradiated states that suggest the final glimpse of a world before it went up in smoke. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).    * ''CARLETON WATKINS: THE ART OF PERCEPTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 9). Standard books about photography published in the first half of this century ignored him, and the public forgot him. Now this show gives many people their first real chance to encounter not just the greatest American landscape photographer of the 19th century but also one of the greatest American artists of the 19th century and one of the great photographers, period. Watkins was a genius. His subject was the West, and his mammoth-plate pictures, panoramas and stereographs (taken with the dual lens camera that simulated, in a kind of cut-out version, three dimensions) mixed the highest degree of clarity with a lean, home-grown compositional style and a spare beauty. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).    Galleries: Uptown    * MARCEL DUCHAMP, ''The Art of Making Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,'' Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212) 988-4500 (through Jan. 15). This show, organized by Francis M. Naumann, a scholar of Dada, Surrealism and Duchamp, accompanies his richly researched book of the same name, the first to focus solely on Duchamp's replications: paintings, sculptures, readymades and graphic works in profusion. This lovingly assembled homage is a feast for Duchamp lovers and an education for those who approach him more warily (Glueck).    NAUM GABO, ''Pioneer of Abstract Sculpture,'' PaceWildenstein, 32 East 67th Street, (212) 421-3292 (though Jan. 8). An important figure in 20th-century art, the Russian-born sculptor Gabo (1890-1977) was among the earliest artists to make truly abstract works in 3-D, and this show gives a very sketchy outline of his long career. He progressed from Cubist-based art, all hard-edged curves and angular planes, to pure geometrical constructions. Later works in the show, made after he came to the United States in 1946, seem more decorative and less interesting, out of tune with the rigorous purity of his early work (Glueck).    ALFRED JACOB MILLER, Gerald Peters, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760 (through Jan. 29). Miller (1810-1874) was among the earliest artist-explorers of the American West. Despite some European training, this Maryland-born artist was a mediocre painter at best. This selection of small works, including portraits of Indians, a buffalo hunt scene and studies for a picture of a bewildered fellow on a small horse, called ''The Lost Greenhorn,'' are interesting more for historic than artistic reasons (Ken Johnson).    SCAR MUNOZ, Throckmorton, 153 East 61st Street, (212) 223-1059 (through Jan. 9). This Columbian artist inventively experiments with photographic processes. He makes self-portraits by filtering charcoal through a photographically treated silk-screen onto a tray of water. Amazingly, the powder coheres as a picture on the surface of the water, and when the water evaporates, a ghostly image remains permanently fixed to the bottom of the tank or to immersed sheets of paper. Works in progress and finished pieces are on view here (Johnson).    ALFRED H. MAURER, ''Aestheticism to Modernism,'' Hollis Taggart Galleries, 48 East 73rd Street, (212) 628-4000 (through Jan. 15). More than 100 paintings from the prolific career of Maurer (1868-1932), a pioneer in American Modernism who was a dazzling colorist, a bold experimenter and the master of several styles. After settling in Paris in 1897 and achieving early success as a romantic realist, he made a dramatic switch to Fauvism and some of the best works here are in the Fauvist mode. Cezanne, too, had an impact, as seen in still lifes, heads and nude figures from his Paris days. Driven home in 1914 by World War I, Maurer was involved with Cubism in the 1920's and early 30's. The show includes fine and ho-hum examples from all phases of his career (Glueck).    Galleries: 57th Street    RAY SMITH AND JULIO GALAN, Sotheby's and Ramis Barquet, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-9090 (through Jan. 6). This two-gallery show presents works from the 80's (at Sotheby's) and the 90's (at Ramis Barquet) by two 40-year-old Mexican artists who each make ambitious, surrealistic, psycho-sexually fraught paintings. Both artists have fallen off from their promising beginnings, Mr. Smith into tricky formal slicing and splicing and Mr. Galan into self-indulgent expressionism, but both remain artists of persuasive personal vision (Johnson).    * ''STILL LIFE IS STILL ALIVE,'' Jan Krugier, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-7288 (Jan. 4 through 15). That the unassuming genre of still life has been the vehicle for some of the 20th century's most adventurous painting is a paradoxical truth affirmed by this excellent exhibition. The selection ranges from works by Modernist masters like Braque, Matisse and Morandi to efforts by idiosyncratic recent figures like Phillip Guston, Wayne Thiebaud and Walter Murch (Johnson).    Galleries: SoHo    TARO CHIEZO, Sandra Gering, 476 Broome Street, (212) 226-8195 (through Jan. 8). This disjunctive show is by an artist who divides his time between Tokyo and New York. It includes brusquely painted pictures of rudimentary cartoon monsters that call to mind Kenny Scharf, and, more interesting, Lego buildings drenched in wax and displayed in stacked, white cages. The possibilities of the latter might be worth developing to more improbable extremes (Johnson).    ''CHOICE 99,'' Exit Art, 548 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-7745 (through Dec. 31). Seven established artists selected 27 emerging artists, producing an uneven, intermittently interesting grab bag of a show. Nan Goldin chose four photographers who look like her disciples. Janine Antoni's intriguingly various picks include knee-high, cartoonish sculptures of theatrical characters by Anissa Mack and a small grid painting by Douglas Ross in which each stitch of the canvas is painted separately, black, gray or white (Johnson).    PAUL GRAHAM, ''End of an Age,'' Scalo, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 334-9393 (through Jan. 16). For his latest book project Mr. Graham photographed young adults at a dance club in Europe. The understated color portraits don't glamorize or sensationalize; rather, they capture mostly attractive but ordinary subjects in isolation at moments of meditative stillness, looking away. They seem suspended, uncertain, vulnerable (Johnson).    SANDRA LERNER, June Kelly, 591 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 226-1660 (through Jan. 4). Working on the floor on big expanses of raw canvas, Ms. Lerner combines traditional Chinese brushwork, Jackson Pollock's splatter, Helen Frankenthaler's staining and Agnes Martin's pencil lines to create pale, beige abstractions that are physically assertive yet spacious and delicate (Johnson).    ''THE PROMISE OF MODERNISM: ART IN INDIA, 1890-1947,'' Dialectica Gallery, 415 West Broadway, (212) 226-8921 (through Jan. 15). New York will be seeing a lot of contemporary work from India in the years ahead. And anyone wanting an evocative sampling of what ''contemporary'' looked like in India more than half a century ago can do no better than to visit this handsomely installed exhibition of small paintings and drawings produced by artists of the Bengal School, centered in and around Calcutta, who blended traditional Indian themes, Western academic and avant-garde influences, and styles from China and Japan (Cotter).    * RICHARD SERRA, ''Torqued Ellipses and Rounds: 15 New Etchings,'' Gemini G.E.L. at Joni Moisant Weyl, 375 West Broadway, near Broome Street, (212) 219-1446 (through Dec. 31). Related to two of Mr. Serra's sculpture projects, the ''Rounds'' range from big circular splotches on spattered grounds to smooth-edged circles balanced in cleaner white fields; the ''Ellipses'' take the form of stretched ovals, some linked, some solitary, on spattered white grounds. The amazing thing about these densely black images is their almost dimensional textures, produced by a complex process that involved squeezing molten material onto a plate laid on the floor and pressing it through an aluminum screen. Days of chemical ''biting'' of each plate followed. The results are forceful works that can still only hint at the muscle of Mr. Serra's achievements in 3-D (Glueck).    Galleries: Chelsea    JOHN DUGDALE, Wessel & O'Connor, 242 West 26th Street, (212) 242-8811 (Jan. 3 through 9). Though deprived of 75 percent of his vision by an AIDS-related stroke, Mr. Dugdale continues to produce his signature blue faux-antique cyanotype photographs. His elegiac figurative works are heartfelt, but kitschy and bordering on arty soft porn; his still lifes -- pictures of three peaches in a row, for example, or a sliver teapot on a stack of saucers -- have an affecting formal and poetic restraint (Johnson).    JENE HIGHSTEIN, Pamela Auchincloss, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 727-2845 (through Jan. 29). Mr. Highstein, who has worked for years at giving organic warmth to the chilly rigor of Minimalism, presents an impressive maquette for a huge sculpture: a bulging, stucco-walled structure shaped like an oval stadium bowl with portals around the bottom. The model, 6 feet high and 15 feet long, has a powerful gallery-filling presence. When realized at its full 30-foot height, it surely will be something to see (Johnson).    JANE KAPLOWITZ, Rupert Goldsworthy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 414-4560 (through Jan. 15). After recycling images from ''Taxi Driver'' last year, Ms. Kaplowitz has taken on rap music advertising. In watery, muted acrylics on eight-foot sheets of paper, she reproduces posters for Snoop Dogg, Hot Boys and other stars, who appear in images of imperial, vaguely menacing splendor. Four enormous pictures in this tiny gallery impinge to powerful and fascinating effect (Johnson).    GLENN LIGON AND KARA WALKER, Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-2262 (Jan. 4 through 8). In shades of black and white, both these artists focus on race to metaphorically complex effect. Mr. Ligon buries resonant sentences by James Baldwin under heavy accretions of coal dust and carborundum. Ms. Walker presents inkblots with tiny cartoon additions that play with racist caricature, and a large cut-out silhouette of a 19th-century black woman holding up a monstrous, abject child with the body of a giant lizard (Johnson).    AARON ROMINE, Kravets/Wehby, 529 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238 (through Jan. 5). This California-based painter, in his first New York solo show, produces a bizarre mix of old-fashioned academic figure painting and pornography. Working painstakingly from photographs of his young male and female friends, in nude group poses, he paints curiously affectless, more or less sexually explicit tableaus. Formally and technically they are dull, but the tension between the high-minded and the low is amusing (Johnson).    Other Galleries    ''E. W. GODWIN: AESTHETIC MOVEMENT ARCHITECT AND DESIGNER,'' Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3023 (through Feb. 27). Godwin (1833-1896), a polymath who functioned as architect, antiquarian, designer, creator of stage sets and costumes, journalist and critic, was a major player in England's art-for-art's sake Aesthetic Movement. But by the turn of the century his name had faded and his work was in limbo. In recent years his maverick contributions to 20th-century modernism have begun to be recognized, however, and this show is an ambitious attempt to establish a firm place for him in the history of architecture and design. The show presents examples of his furniture, notably the Anglo-Japanese pieces that were his specialty; specimens of his wallpaper and textile designs, architectural plans and photographs and sketches of his theatrical ventures. But be warned: it demands patient looking and an eye for detail (Glueck).    * ''INVERTED ODYSSEYS,'' Claude Cahun, Maya Deren and Cindy Sherman, Grey Art Gallery of New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (Jan. 4 through 29). Three women who have used the camera to reinvent themselves in multifarious guises share this show, based on a recently discovered cache of photographs by Cahun (1896-1954), a French-born writer and actress whose work was rarely shown in her lifetime. Performing for her lens the roles of clown, Buddha, sailor, courtesan, rag doll, vampire and even her father, Cahun gives a tantalizing glimpse of a very private universe. Deren (1917-1961) starred in her own epic films, stills from which are shown here. And Cindy Sherman dreams up multiple personas relating more to the kitschy psychodrama of American culture than her own interior life. One of the fresher presentations of the season (Glueck).    ''ISSEY MIYAKE MAKING THINGS,'' Ace Gallery, 275 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 255-5599 (through Feb. 29). An ambitious, often snazzily installed exhibition that reviews some of the highs and one or two lows of the Japanese clothing designer's brilliant career. Mr. Miyake's genius for new materials and techniques is spelled out in a gallery called ''Laboratory'' and brought to life in one called ''Jumping.'' Here, 24 brilliantly colored, ingeniously pleated, folded and wrinkled garments are suspended from the ceiling like abstract sculptures. As they drift and bounce (with mechanical aid), they reveal both their engineering and the freedom of movement they allow. Equally liberating are their lack of cultural specificity and their refusal to project an ideal female body. Mr. Miyake is more modern than postmodern, a sincere formalist who has made some of the most radical, optimistic and generous clothes of his time. Admission: $6 (Smith).    * ''THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS,'' Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718) 448-2500 (through Jan. 2). Two rewarding shows, one of photographs of children and the other of works made by artists under the influence of toys, ponder the mystique of the child. In photographs by 13 artists ranging from Lewis Carroll to Sally Mann, the child seems a stranger from another planet. Toylike works by a dozen artists, including lesser-knowns like Gail Goldsmith and Robert Kalka and better-knowns like Tom Otterness and Ellen Phelan, join innocence and experience to resonant effect. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $2 (Johnson).    FRED TOMASELLI AND LEE BOROSON, Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through Jan. 7). Mr. Tomaselli presents a single, spectacular painting called ''Gravity's Rainbow.'' Imbedded in lustrous clear resin, necklace-like chains of pills, marijuana leaves, flower blossoms and cut-out photographs of body parts crisscross a deep black 8-by-20-foot field to richly decorative and cosmic effect. In the Sculpture Court (through March 17), Mr. Boroson's expansive highway cloverleaf made of inflated blue parachute silk hovers overhead, absurd yet utopian (Johnson).    Last Chance    RICHMOND BURTON, Cheim & Read, 521 West 23rd Street, (212) 242-7727 (through Thursday). With each show Mr. Burton seems a little more to relax his impulse toward symmetry and to indulge his gift for ornament. He does both in the melodious, jazzy abstract paintings here. With their metallic colors -- gold, silver, copper -- they have the fluid, textural presence of luxury fabrics; their densely packed curving patterns suggest flames, leaves and scraps of Arabic calligraphy (Cotter).    ISABEL DE OBALDIA, ''Captive Spirits,'' Mary-Anne Martin Fine Art, 23 East 73rd Street, (212) 288-2213 (through today). Demons, beasts, gods and ghosts are the subjects of these fanciful small-scale sculptures by a Panamanian artist. Made of milky cast glass infused with color, they glow with a gentle translucence that gives them a presence more spectral than physical. Some are on the edge of being cute, but their charisma prevails (Glueck).    GORDON MATTA-CLARK, David Zwirner, 43 Greene Street, SoHo (212) 966-9074 (through today). This selection of work from the early 1970's by the legendary architectural deconstructor gives a good sense of his playfully anarchic avant-gardism. Included are ''Garbage Wall,'' a wall of street refuse; a puzzle consisting of detritus from the artist's floor; and ''Fresh Air Cart,'' a low-tech vehicle for dispensing oxygen from a tank to people on the street (Johnson).    THOMAS STRUTH, ''New Pictures From Paradise,'' Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160 (through today). This new body of mural-scale prints in color and black and white by Mr. Struth, a German photographer, is devoted largely to what he calls ''paradises'' -- dense primeval jungles in Australia, Japan and Southwest China -- with several digressions to cathedrals in Italy and a temple in Japan. Lush and wild in their aboriginal state, the jungles seem tangible enough to engulf the viewer who steps too close. In sharp contrast, the cathedrals and the temple articulate civilizations centuries in the making. These photographs may not be models of lighting, composition or artifice, but they are impressive because of Mr. Struth's passionate immersion in his subjects (Glueck).    MIKE COCKRILL, Kim Foster Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-0044 (through today). Working with wide, loaded brushes, Mr. Cockrill paints pictures of prepubescent girls threatening and abusing abject clowns (Johnson).   ART GUIDE"},{"year":"1999","title":"Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan.

Also, some museums are closed New Year's Day. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.    Museums    ''THE AMERICAN CENTURY: ART AND CULTURE, PART 2: 1950-2000,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 13). Filling the museum's six floors, this complicated, conflicted exhibition once more demonstrates the difficulty of mounting sweepingly inclusive exhibitions with no discernible point of view. It displays hundreds of works in dozens of mediums expertly placed in contexts that constantly pull one's attention outward, toward the show's flickering edges: landmark events, famous personalities, banned or controversial books, emblematic snippets of film, song and television and even the ephemeral. But these do not disguise a discouragingly conventional core and the predictable, severely truncated story told by the objects on view. The many great works in the show's first half tend to be overly familiar because they are mostly drawn from the museum's collection. Moving toward the present, the works become weaker, the choices of artists arbitrary, the sense of history increasingly confused and the absence of non-American artists more and more glaring. Ultimately one senses not an ''American Century'' or even half-century but two decades, the 1950's and 60's, during which American art -- seen in isolation -- held its ground.

This Belgian maverick's scatological inclinations have resulted in one of the rare idea-laden Conceptual artworks that must be constructed to achieve its full effect, and seen to be believed.

Museums     ''MARLENE DUMAS: NAME NO NAMES,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through June 2). A white South African artist now living in Amsterdam, Ms. Dumas touches visually on many issues important to the modern psyche: gender, identity, power, politics, love, sex, babies, machismo and racial inequality. She translates her ideas into raw drawings with such ease and fluency that her art seems to say conversationally, ''Hey, this is how it is.'' But ingratiating it isn't. Unabashedly swiping images from high art, fashion, the news media, comic strips and what-all, she creates her own flawed but very human world, where prostitutes ply their trade without compunction, men display their genitals, the strains of pregnancy are visible, babies look birth-ugly and rows of multiracial portraits serve to remind that the global majority is not white. Her quirky but eloquent draftsmanship and no-shame willingness to deal with raw human material make this show an exhilarating experience. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.","excerpt":"Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students, artists and 65+ (Grace Glueck).     * ''ORAZIO AND ARTEMISIA GENTILESCHI: FATHER AND DAUGHTER PAINTERS IN BAROQUE ITALY,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through May 12). Orazio took Caravaggio's art out of the cellar and into the sun. Artemisia's work has a visceral charge her father's doesn't. Besides getting the predictable crowds attracted by her fame, the show ought to cause visitors to look patiently at Orazio's paintings, which should come as a revelation to many people. He is one of those curious cases of a coarse man capable of making the sweetest art, as if a hard outer shell were protection for a soft heart. Artemisia, the celebrity, was a great artist, too, when she was good. The exhibition is basically a connoisseur's exercise, treating both him and her respectfully as artists of variable talents who would have wanted to be remembered for what they painted, not as symbols or victims or fodder for modern novelists, cultural theorists and pop psychologists. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).     ''IN THE FLOW: ARTISTS FROM THE LIVING MUSEUM,'' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700 (through July 7). The first formal museum exhibition of work by 20 artists from the Living Museum, a 19-year-old innovative art program at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens Village, runs the stylistic gamut from classic folk art to work that would look at home in a Chelsea gallery. The high point is an installation by an artist named John Tursi, whose 20-foot-tall painted scrolls unleash a universe of colorful semi-abstract beings whose naughty activities are far outweighed by their decorative force. The end result of the show, in addition to quite a bit of viewing pleasure, is to once more render the insider art-outsider art distinction moot (Roberta Smith).     ''JEWISH LIFE IN ANCIENT EGYPT: A FAMILY ARCHIVE FROM THE NILE VALLEY,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through May 12). Although the Jews, led by Moses, fled centuries of bondage in Egypt around 1250 B.C., they were back in the country, by then Persian-ruled, as free citizens 800 years later. So say the biblical books of II Kings and Jeremiah, and their assertions are confirmed by the 1893 discovery of a papyrus collection on Elephantine Island in the Nile. Among scrolls from that collection given to the museum 50 years ago, and now displayed in this small show, are several relating to the family of Ananiah, a priest at a temple on the island. The scrolls are legal documents about Ananiah's marriage to an Egyptian slave girl, the couple's purchase of a house, her freedom from bondage by her master and more minor transactions. The museum has raised the visual quotient by adding works from its own collection, like a striking granite statue (680-650 B.C.) of an Egyptian worshiper. But the soul of the show is the story told by the not very visual papyri. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3, students and 62+ (Glueck).     * ''OSKAR KOKOSCHKA: EARLY PORTRAITS FROM VIENNA AND BERLIN, 1909-1914,'' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 (through June 10). The ''schlag de la schlag'' of European culture, as well as its decadence, posed for the Austrian Expressionist Kokoschka (1886-1980) during his five-year concentration on portraits at an early stage of his life. The architect Adolf Loos, the composer Anton von Webern, the famous husband collector Alma Mahler (with whom Kokoschka had a passionate affair), as well as Kokoschka himself, are included in this dazzling array of faces and their expressive extension, hands. Several of the show's most gripping visages are of patients in a Swiss tuberculosis sanitarium, among them Victoire de Montesquiou-Fezensac, whose pale, brooding face and long emaciated torso speak eloquently of the illness she tried to conceal by dressing herself to the nines. The portrait, one of his penetrating best, was later included in the notorious ''Degenerate Art'' exhibition staged by the Nazis in 1937. Kokoschka went on to a long career of painting, writing and humanitarian causes, but these insightful portraits are possibly his greatest achievements. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 65+ (Glueck)     * ''THE NEW WAY OF TEA,'' Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, and Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 327-9276 (through May 19). Ever since powdered tea was introduced in Japan 800 years ago by Zen monks studying in China, the Japanese have been fine-tuning the complex culture known as the way of tea, called the tea ceremony in the West. Much deeper than a social rite, the tea culture involves elements from Zen Buddhism and the classic Shinto religion, as well as Japanese appreciation of the seasonal phenomena of nature. This show takes a look at the tea ceremony going back to the 16th century, when it began to develop a Japanese identity over its Chinese origins. But the focus is on contemporary teahouses and utensils by Japanese designers and those from East Asia and the West, with seven teahouses and their furnishings set up in the two institutions. They are accompanied by paintings and 100 examples of bowls, kettles, tea and incense containers, scoops, water jars, chopsticks and other implements. The display proves proves that although the way of tea has evolved as a spiritual and philosophical experience, it provides delight in objects of earthly, sensual appeal. Asia Society hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+. Japan Society hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and 65+ (Glueck).     * ''GERHARD RICHTER: 40 YEARS OF PAINTING,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through May 21). One of the finest, most beautiful and strangely moving exhibitions of the work of a living painter in years. You could quibble about one picture or another, but it is just about pitch perfect as an overview of this 70-year-old German master's maddeningly kaleidoscopic and exquisitely refined output. Since the mid-1960's, Mr. Richter has undoubtedly been Europe's most challenging painter, an evasive switch-hitter between realism and abstraction. You need to see the work, like all good art, firsthand to grasp properly its dizzying diversity, spooky presence and tactile allure. Mr. Richter maintains a kind of cruel faith. The world is mean and absurd. Nature is sublime but indifferent to us. Mass culture turns thinking people into sheep. But beauty is still out there. We can see it only if we don't lie to ourselves. It's what is left after you strip away the clich&#233;s and false rhetoric. ''I constantly despair at my own incapacity, at the impossibility of ever accomplishing anything, of painting a valid, true picture or of even knowing what such a thing ought to look like,'' he once wrote. ''But then I always have the hope that, if I persevere, it might one day happen.'' Clearly it does happen in the show, again and again. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).     * ''THE RUSSIAN AVANT-GARDE BOOK, 1910-34,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through May 21). In its final offering before going dark on West 53rd Street for a three-year expansion, the Modern has come up with a very MOMA show. Immaculately installed, it's a classic combination of visual &#233;lan and radical ideas. The 300 books on display were designed and in many cases collaboratively made -- printed, collaged, painted, annotated, bound -- by some of Russia's greatest modern artists and poets. The early examples are playfully anarchic; after the 1917 revolution they become graphically more logical and symmetrical, and photographic. The best of them are as vibrant as any painting and, with their hand-sewn bindings, wrap-around designs and textured covers, have the material presence of sculpture. Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter).     * ''THE SHORT CENTURY: INDEPENDENCE AND LIBERATION MOVEMENTS IN AFRICA, 1945-1994,'' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through May 5). This landmark assemblage of art and artifact -- including photojournalism, film and music -- aims to tell the tumultuous, cruel yet culturally rich history of postcolonial Africa. The course painting and popular culture, the interrelationship of the political and the visual, the clash of the modern and the tribal, and the roles of important leaders and writers are among its many themes. For example, one can trace the charismatic, Patrice Lumumba (the doomed leader present at birth of Congo in 1960) from documentary film to folk painting to video memoir, watching the ripple effect of his legacy. Brilliant advantage is taken of P.S. 1's vast, multidirectional structure, and against all odds, the show largely and unforgettably succeeds, in the process breathing new life into the large-scale context-oriented exhibition form. A good point of entry into its complexities is Ousmane Semb&#232;ne's ''Borom Sarret,'' a fablelike 1963 film classic that seems to encapsulate past, present and future within its crystalline form (Smith).     * ''SURREALISM: DESIRE UNBOUND,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through May 12). Destined to be popular, this show is not your ladies-who-lunch Met exhibition, particularly because of a small amount of pornography, although only bluenoses and people who have never looked closely at what's on view every day in the permanent collection of the museum will find the presence of erotic Surreal art truly daring or sensational. Organized and first presented by the Tate Modern in London last year, the event has ''desire'' as its unnecessary motif, as if it were not previously self-evident that sex was always at the heart of the Surrealist program. There are plenty of chestnuts to please the masses, like Magritte's painting of hooded lovers kissing, an illustration that love is blind, and Dal&#237;'s lobster telephone, although what the telephone has to do with desire is not clear. A few works still raise eyebrows, and some of the old jokes are still funny. But success neutered the movement decades ago. The Surrealists, having opened everybody's eyes to the essential weirdness of everyday life, fostered the demand for ever greater anomalies, relegating their own work to the quaint status of bowler hats and antique sewing machines. Now much of it looks small and slightly embarrassing. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).     * ''2002 BIENNIAL EXHIBITION,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street (212) 570-3676, and in Central Park (through May 26). The Biennial, the show that almost always gets the art world's knickers in a twist, is looking good this time around. One whole floor (the top one) works totally as an integrated installation, and there are strong sections on the two other floors. If photography and painting are in shortish supply, there's lots of sound and digital art, an excellent film program, an off-site sculpture show in Central Park and all sorts of oddball, handmade stuff on the walls and floors -- stained glass, quilts, lacework, architectural models -- making this an unusually labor-intensive show. The main thing this Biennial has going for it, though, is a thematic point of view that has to do, in ways hilarious and sad, with American culture and spiritual history, from the Transcendentalist 19th century to the psychedelic 60's to the standing-here-wondering now. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8, students and 62+ (Cotter).     Galleries: Uptown     * ''ENDURING ART OF JADE AGE CHINA: CHINESE JADE OF LATE NEOLITHIC THROUGH HAN PERIODS, VOLUME II,'' Throckmorton Fine Art, 153 East 61st Street, (212) 223-1059 (through April 27). Jade was invested with moral weight and spiritual power in ancient China. Its touch ensured immortality, and because it was extremely difficult to work, anything made from it carried the glamour of rarity. That aura lingers around the small, intricate pieces here, from a statuette of a nude woman (circa 1500 B.C.) to a zany little figure with a human torso emerging from the body of a snake. The curator, Elizabeth Childs-Johnson, has suggested that jade was perceived as a vehicle of metamorphosis and transformation: just as the man leaves the serpent behind, so human life leaves earth for eternity. The show beautifully illustrates such metaphors (Cotter).     ''EROTICA AND THE LIKE,'' CDS Gallery, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555 (through April 27). The rather loose title covers a wildly assorted gathering of works (mostly small) by a starry cast of artists from Goya to Picasso to Lucian Freud. Some are more erotic than others: three roisterous Picasso etchings from his well-known ''347'' series of sexual fantasias; a couple of de Kooning drawings of nudes from the 1940's that exude a savage sexuality; an undated drawing by the Surrealist Hans Bellmer of a head with multiple appurtenances. A more tender meditation on lovemaking is occasioned by Jim Peters's tiny wax nude couple. Bonnard, Louise Bourgeois, Robert Graham, Tom Wesselmann, Balthus and Vuillard are among others represented (Glueck).    Galleries: 57th Street     GRAHAM GILLMORE, Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929 (through April 27). Mr. Gillmore incises funny, often self-deprecating texts into super-glossy abstract paintings. In one we read, ''Although there are no cures for this painting, there are treatments and there is hope'' (Ken Johnson).     JACK TWORKOV: ''RED, WHITE AND BLUE,'' Ameringer/Howard/Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 935-1110, and Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, (through April 13). Although the American flag won its best-known homage in mid-20th-century art from Jasper Johns, it crept into the work of other artists as well, among them Jack Tworkov (1900-1982), whose Abstract Expressionist painting was distinguished by its vigorous brushing and vibrant color. As it was for Johns, for Tworkov the flag was there, and its rigid format offered opportunities for all manner of exploration. In short, precisely because of its esteem as a symbol, its form could be played with and reordered. One example here is ''Oh Columbia'' (1962), a big, loose rendering of the Stars and Stripes in red, white and blue, notable for its relaxed paint handling, insertion of verticals to arrest the horizontal flow and its bleary, blurred appearance, as if perceived by a drunk. As a demonstration not of flag-waving but of how a symbol can impinge on an artist's consciousness, this makes an engrossing two-gallery show (Glueck).    Galleries: Chelsea     PETER COFFIN, ''Perfect if On,'' Andrew Kreps, 516 West 20th Street, (212) 741-8849 (through April 20). A greenhouse in which various live musicians play for the plants; hazy pastel-colored photographic prints said to be actual recordings of people's spiritual auras; and diagrammatic red line-drawing on the wall that is supposed to represent telepathic communication: is Mr. Coffin spoofing New Age mythologies, or is he a real believer? It's hard to tell. (Johnson)     JACK FEATHERLY, Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212) 279-9219 (through April 15). Mr. Featherly's snappy abstract paintings are smart and likable. Crisp, meandering lines or circles moving over, around and through brushy, blotchy patches of saturated, glossy color create an engaging spatial counterpoint while playfully questioning the great 20th-century romance of abstract painting (Johnson).     ROBERT HAWKINS, Gracie Mansion, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 505-9577 (through April 13). Mr. Hawkins is a funny, eccentric image-maker and a good-enough painter. On square, easel-size canvases, he depicts a kangaroo with a koala bear in her pouch; Pilgrims and Indians sitting down to a gargantuan roast turkey; Neanderthal men ambushing a deer in the forest; and, in an image that approaches moral profundity, a golden crown placed as bait in a bear trap (Johnson).     NICKY HOBERMAN, Feigen Contemporary, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 929-0500 (through April 13). Small and prepubescent children not seen at their psychological best are the subjects of this London-based painter. Worked up from Polaroids, their oddly distorted bodies float in mostly empty space as -- alone or with others -- they keep their distance, with expressions and body language that can't be described as welcoming. The works could be read as symbols of the present-day societal anomie that extends even to childhood, but they are more than just symbols. Many of us would recognize these woe-burdened children on home ground (Glueck).     * ELIZABETH MURRAY, PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000 (through April 27). Small, cut-and-folded watercolors replay Ms. Murray's familiar tales of domestic craziness starring animated coffee cups and splay-legged tables. They don't have the funky muscularity of her big paintings, but the intimate scale, lucid color and not-too-fussy craft make for a pleasing change of pace (Johnson).     JOVI SCHNELL, ''Galactic Pulses,'' Derek Eller, 526-30 West 26th Street, (212) 206-6411 (through April 13). If Jim Nutt, Trevor Winkfield and Dr. Seuss decided to collaborate, they might produce paintings something like Ms. Schnell's. Though not quite as weirdly individualized as anything by those artists, her trippy, crisply outlined agglomerations of cellular, mechanical, architectural, botanical and sexual forms are well designed and have an appealingly bouncy comic spirit (Johnson).    Galleries: SoHo     * ELLEN GALLAGHER, ''Preserve,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through April 18). This exhibition features a painter's first major work in three dimensions plus a series of collages -- altered pages of advertisements for wigs from old issues of magazines like Ebony and Black Stars. The collages suffer from a heavy-handed obviousness, but the sculpture, an expansive construction of white wooden dowels like a children's jungle gym, almost imperceptibly decorated with abstracted elements of racist caricature, works both formally and metaphorically (Johnson).     * HANNO OTTEN, ''Color Block Series,'' Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 431-0166 (through April 20). Projecting colored light directly onto photographic paper, Mr. Otten produces smart, gorgeous, completely abstract photograms. The technique evokes a history of avant-garde photography dating back to Man Ray and Laszlo Moholy-Nage; the overlapping, slightly off-kilter squares, rectangles and bands of luminous, translucent color call to mind any number of Modernist grid painters. But the unabashed hedonism is utterly contemporary (Johnson).     ''REACTIONS,'' Exit Art, 548 Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 966-7745 (through April 20). A few months ago the gallery sent out about 10,000 letters inviting responses to the events of Sept. 11. More than 2,500 pieces arrived, and they're all on view here, edge to edge in alphabetical order by artist. The work ranges from scrawled words to children's drawings to sophisticated graphics with contributions by some art world stars rubbing shoulders with anonymous submissions. Especially interesting is the attitudinal mix, which includes a current of dissident, anti-establishment political anger. In the second gallery is original artwork for Sept. 11 publications by DC Comics and the truly alternative World War Threellustrated (Cotter).     ED RUSCHA, ''Country Cityscapes,'' Susan Inglett, 100 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0573 (through April 20). Though minor, this presentation of new prints affirms Mr. Ruscha's unrivaled connection to the sacred-and-profane spirit of America. Richly colored photogravure pictures of wild Western landscapes are interrupted by blanks reserved for movie tough-talk printed in the margin below (''You will eat hot lead.'') A large lithograph has white letters against a dark, cloudy sky, divinely announcing, ''Safe And Effective Medication'' (Johnson).     ''THREE PAINTERS,'' Margarete Roeder, 545 Broadway, between Prince and Spring Streets, (212) 925-6098 (through April 27). The three participating in this elegant show are abstractionists who want nothing to interfere with the sensuous experience of pure painting. Rudolf de Crignis makes deep blue squares with perfectly satiny surfaces; Peter Tollens paints monochromatic fields that have a dry, slightly crusty texture; and Michael Toenges builds his pictures out of big, thick and greasy brushstrokes (Johnson).     SUSAN WEIL, ''Moving Pictures,'' Tagore, 137 Greene Street, (212) 677-4520 (through April 21). The earliest piece in this show is a full-body profile of the artist on blueprint paper, a collaboration from 1950 between Ms. Weil and her then-husband, Robert Rauschenberg. For the most interesting of her recent work, the artist cuts up large, Matissean paintings on paper into paperback-size rectangles, scrambles the pieces and pins them to the wall in grids to polyrhythmic visual effect (Johnson).    Other Galleries     * ''THIN SKIN: THE FICKLE NATURE OF BUBBLES, SPHERES AND INFLATABLE STRUCTURES,'' AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-4818 (through April 13). Designed to explain why so many artists these days are working with balloons, bubbles, diaphanous or transparent surfaces and similar forms and materials, this entertaining 22-artist exhibition includes Andy Warhol's floating Mylar pillows, Ernesto Neto's sensuous environment of stuffed Lycra, an installation by Olafur Eliasson where water drops disturb the surface of a shallow pool, and a photograph of Tom Friedman with a bubble of saliva frozen in his open mouth (Johnson).     * TIM HAWKINSON, ''&#220;berorgan,'' Ace Gallery, 275 Hudson Street, at Dominic Street, South Village, (212) 255-5599 (through May 15). The art world's master tinkerer and garage genius has cobbled together an enormous, slightly insane conflation of human body and musical instrument, seemingly from scraps. This Goldbergian contraption funnels air into room-size white plastic balloons, which resemble bladders or lungs and function as primitive bagpipes. The piece meanders in and out of six big spaces in this Super Bowl-size gallery, and gives one the feeling of visiting a zoo of mournful whales or walking through the belly of some inchoate beast. But its most haunting effect may be purely aural (Smith).    Last Chance     GEORG BASELITZ, Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623 (through tomorrow). This small show of works from the 1990's by the German Neo-Expressionist features two big, primitivistic sculptures -- a head and an armless, legless female figure -- incongruously covered in patches of plaid fabric. They have a certain imposingly brutal yet oddly folksy presence. On the walls hang smallish, roughly poetic watercolors in which sketchy figures appear upside down (Johnson).     * ''CHINESE PORCELAIN AND SILVER IN THE SONG DYNASTY,'' J. J. Lally & Co. 41 E. 57th St., (212) 371-3380 (Through Monday). This ethereal show mixes media in revelatory ways. Silver objects, often produced for high-end domestic use, served as models for Song-period porcelains, and marvelous examples of both are here for instructive comparison. Other visual delights include a range of porcelains with off-white glazes that seem to change before your eyes, like the colors of a mood ring (Cotter).     * BRYAN CROCKETT, ''Cultured,'' Lehmann Maupin, 39 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 965-0753 (through tomorrow). This show, maybe the creepiest in town, features seven possum-size sculptures of hairless baby mice, seemingly carved from pink marble (but actually cast in faux-stone composite). Each mouse represents a scientifically updated version of a deadly sin: the snarling representative of anger is said to be pumped up on testosterone; an immensely fat glutton has been given an extra gene for obesity. Whatever the conceptual import, these bizarrely lifelike animals are wonderfully repulsive (Johnson).     ALFRED EISENSTAEDT/AL HIRSCHFELD, Leica Gallery, 670 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 777-3051 (through tomorrow). Working for Life magazine, Eisenstaedt produced some of the most memorable journalistic photographs ever. Including the famous kiss on V-J Day, Sophia Loren in a semitransparent negligee and John F. Kennedy at his desk with young Caroline in a swimsuit, this exhibition reminds us how deeply photography saturates modern consciousness. Mr. Hirschfeld, the great cartoon chronicler of New York theater, is almost 99. This small celebratory show of photographs includes two new prints by the artist; photographic portraits by his wife, Louise Kerz; and many family snapshots (Johnson).     * ''MODERNISM AND ABSTRACTION,'' National Academy of Design Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Sunday). In recent years the Smithsonian in Washington has accumulated an impressive, if small, collection of 20th-century American works, strongest in Modernism and Abstract Expressionism but with a few choice examples from earlier and later periods. The more than 50 paintings and sculptures here make up a show that has more breadth than depth, with no claim to comprehensiveness. But there are fine works by Stuart Davis, Arthur Dove, Georgia O'Keeffe, Robert Motherwell, Ellsworth Kelly, Ilya Bolotowsky, Jan Matulka, Carl Holty, Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg and others. The show provides an illuminating glimpse of what went on in American art across a 75-year period with a few surprises and discoveries. The pervasive feeling of the installation is of blazing light and color, from Dove's ''Sun'' (1943), a rhythmical composition in yellows, greens and blues, to Hockney's big, superchromatic highway abstraction ''Double Entrance'' (1993-95). Viewed as a serendipitous windfall, the show repays a visit. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $5, students; $4.50, 65+ (Glueck).

Museums    * ''TRISHA BROWN: DANCE AND ART IN DIALOGUE, 1961-2001,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222, through Jan. 25. Ms. Brown's 40-odd years of innovative dance creation and performance brought about some memorable collaborations with painters, sculptors and musicians, among them Robert Rauschenberg, Donald Judd, Nancy Graves, Fujiko Nakaya, John Cage and Laurie Anderson. The dance pieces are vividly conveyed here by means of video and sound installations, still photographs, costumes, props, music, diagrams, sculptures, paintings and drawings that graphically demonstrate how Ms. Brown's boldly eccentric choreography has been enhanced by her friends from other disciplines. She has contributed a pair of intricate drawings recently made by putting charcoal between her toes as she danced on large sheets of paper. It's not easy to translate the dynamics of dance into a museum environment, but this vibrant show works diligently to revivify the experience.

Our published designs have formed the basis for the levitation and propulsion systems in the Japanese superconducting maglev project the Youngs discuss, as acknowledged by its developers.    The Youngs state that maglev consumes at least three times as much energy per passenger mile as Japan's bullet high-speed rail train. However, their comparisons reflect totally different conditions. The Japanese maglev trains will travel at 300 miles per hour in tunnels where air drag effects are large, while the bullet trains travel at 140 m.p.h. in the open air. Sixty percent of the proposed Tokyo-Osaka maglev route is in tunnels because of the mountainous terrain. This new route represents a social decision by the Japanese to open previously undeveloped portions of their crowded country.   When traveling under similar conditions -- at the same speed and both in tunnels or both in open air -- maglev passengers use much less energy per passenger mile than high-speed rail passengers. This is because maglev vehicles are much lighter than high-speed rail trains, and there is no mechanical friction with the track.   The Youngs also do not compare maglev with auto and air travel. Maglev at 300 m.p.h. uses half the primary thermal energy per passenger mile that 60 m.p.h. autos do, and only a quarter of that used by airplanes. United States transport energy use would be considerably reduced by shifting to maglev. Moreover, maglev does not use oil fuel, but electricity from clean coal, hydro, solar or nuclear power.   The Youngs are wrong in stating that maglev cannot carry freight. Maglev could readily and economically transport most of the United States truck-type freight, in addition to passengers. Maglev forces are distributed over a large area on the guideway, and there is no mechanical contact","excerpt":"thus maintenance requirements are very low, even if freight is carried. In contrast, carrying freight on high-speed rail trains would quickly wear out and destroy the precisely positioned tracks from the constant heavy pounding. Even carrying passengers, high-speed rail tracks require a large maintenance force.   As for the health effects of magnetic fields, maglev can be designed so that passengers experience a constant magnetic field of the same strength -- about 1/2 gauss -- as all life forms evolved in and are exposed to on earth. Passengers in electrified rail trains typically experience strong magnetic fields that alternate at power-line frequencies. Such alternating fields are of potentially much greater concern.   Maglev, if it is implemented, will have enormous environmental, safety and economic benefits. It can greatly reduce pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, provide greater and safer mobility at lower cost, and reduce dependence on foreign oil. If we are to improve our environment and living standards, we must bring forward new technologies to solve our crisis problems. JAMES R. POWELL GORDON T.

If they had not also coincided with so many other great photographers, they might have constituted a golden age all by themselves.    Cartier-Bresson, born in 1908 in France and trained as a painter, started taking pictures almost by happenstance -- he bought a secondhand camera while traveling in Africa in 1931. Newton, born Helmut Neust* dter in Berlin in 1920, and Avedon, born in 1923 in New York City, both decided on photographic careers when they were adolescents. All three, then, started taking pictures during the 1930's, the decade that photographic images first truly saturated the world -- it was the decade of Life and its many European predecessors and counterparts. Periodicals began using photos to tell a story rather than as mere illustrative adjuncts to text. At the same time, and perhaps paradoxically, it became widely accepted that photographs were not bound to the literal truth, that they could be just as subjective and indeterminate as works in any other visual medium.

What could they be but delightful, these 900-odd letters, dated from 1912 to 1999, by an actor celebrated for his candor who took his art seriously indeed without letting it inhibit observation, gossip, snobbery and affection.    RED SKY AT MORNING: America and the Crisis of the Global Environment, by James Gustave Speth. (Yale University, $24.) A profoundly sobering study, by an environmental adviser to Presidents Carter and Clinton, of the nation's failure to address the probability of global warming both in the past, when there might have been time, and now, when there may not.    PORT MUNGO, by Patrick McGrath. (Knopf, $24.) This immensely clever, tautly composed novel concerns a Gauguinistic artist who flees the suffocating confines of London for New York, then Havana, then Port Mungo, at the end of world and mind, where his genius flourishes. Unless it doesn't, since we learn that the narrator of all this is quite unreliable and full of hidden purpose.    YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IN THE LAND OF THE FREE, by James Kelman. (Harcourt, $25.) Jeremiah Brown, Kelman's hero in this novel, is a down-and-outer, authority hater and epic drinkist. Brought up Glaswegian, he has lived in the United States for 12 years and acquired the analytical powers that make this paranoid performance, set mainly in bars, a brilliant gloss on the political and social reverberations of 9/11 in this country.

Ms. Black's documentary follows the men who arrive on H-2 visas, temporary permits that allow foreigners to take jobs for which employers cannot find Americans. According to the film, each year 10,000 Jamaicans respond to the promise of more money than they can make at home, and become virtual prisoners, crowded into dormitories that resemble Army barracks, paid at most $5 an hour -- minus transportation and housing fees -- for grueling field work.

Two songwriters who promise to revitalize country music - or country-rock, or rock-and-roll - are appearing in successive shows tonight in association with the College Media Journal convention of alternative rock. The early show, at 8:30, presents Steve Earle, who draws on the three-chord basics and populist sentiments of Bruce Springsteen and John Fogerty, but sings with a solid twang. The late show, at 11:30, brings Jason and the Scorchers - honky-tonk's answer to the Sex Pistols - a band that takes traditionalist country storytelling and the songwriter Jason Ringenberg's fondness for Southern myths, then backs it up with full-tilt rock. Opening for each band is Steve Skrovane","excerpt":"tickets are $10.   Silly Wizard, the Triplex, 199 Chambers Street (618-1980). Silly Wizard is so steeped in Celtic traditional music - especially the dance tunes, airs and ballads of Scotland - that its new tunes tend to sound a few centuries old, while the wars and romances commemorated in old traditional songs still seem current. Silly Wizard has been breaking up and regrouping irregularly during the past few years, but with the virtuosic Cunningham brothers - John on fiddle, Phil on accordion, whistles and keyboards (including a synthesizer now and then) - and the gentle tenor voice of Andy M.

One of the best small ensembles to come out of the late 1980's, Arcado works like a chamber group, but includes intense improvisations. The members -- Mark Dresser on bass, Mark Feldman on violin, Hank Roberts on cello -- swoop in and out of written sections that call to mind European classical composing as well as all sorts of other sources.

A Gospel Bargain     \\"Gospel, Africa and the Blues,\\" S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, Manhattan, (212) 243-4940. A triple bill built for a recession: for $15, a listener gets the deep gospel fervor of Clarence Fountain and the Five Blind Boys, the blues-based secular eclecticism of the Holmes Brothers, and the soft folk of the Ugandan singer Samite. Mr. Fountain is a certified house rocker; the Holmes Brothers toss be-bop lines played on pedal steel guitar into the gospel harmonies and blues and soul songs, and Samite uses acoustic instruments to create a gentle mood. The show on Sunday night starts at 8.  Virtuoso With Quirks   Dorothy Donegan, Fortune Garden Pavilion, 209 East 49th Street in Manhattan, (212) 753-0101. Dorothy Donegan is one of jazz's great eccentrics, a musician fearless when it comes to improvising with tunes; she'll play a European classical run in the middle of a Duke Ellington piece, or throw in some boogie-woogie to mix things up. She's also a virtuoso, so her eclecticism is neither glib nor a mask. She's one of jazz's great undiscovered minds, and when she turns to glare at the audience, she's a terrific comedian as well. Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 9:30 and 11; Sunday's shows are at 7, 8:30 and 10 P.M. THere is no cover charge; the minimum charge is $2o for the first two sets and $15 for the third set.

David and David (whose last names are Baerwald, the lyricist-singer, and Ricketts, the composer-guitarist-keyboardist) write about the casualties of Tinseltown glamour in songs like their current hit, ''Boomtown.'' Like a latter-day Steely Dan, they wrap terse, catchy pop tunes around intelligently cynical lyrics.

The original star of the international ska scene was born in Cuba, got the beat in Jamaica and became a hit maker in England in 1959. Now he is 70 and on his fourth comeback, but that doesn't mean he can't get the crowd jumping with his good-natured bawdiness and charming lover's style. For this engagement he is backed by the New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble, a horn-happy bunch of rhythm maniacs.

Jimmy (Fastfingers) Dawkins is among the finest Chicago blues guitarists working: elemental and raw and intense. He's also serious. Instead of the standard good-time Saturday-night-party functionalism, he delivers pain and heartbreak. His band, also from Chicago, finds the pleasure groove and stays there.

Featuring the saxophonist Gary Bartz, the trumpeter Charles Tolliver and the trombonist Grachan Moncur 3d in the front line, and a rhythm section of John Hicks, Mickey Bass and Victor Lewis, the Reunion Legacy Band brings together some of the better players who arrived in the late 1960's and early 70's. Mr. Bartz has been one of New York's consistently exciting improvisers for years, and his recent appearances have had him burning through material, mixing be-bop with Coltrane-esque phrases and more. Mr. Lewis is one of jazz's best drummers. There is a $15 cover and a two-drink minimum; shows today through Sunday are at 9:30 P.M., 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M. There is no third set on Sunday.

One of the next wave of Haitian bands in New York, Rara Machine does its best to mix older guitar-driven Haitian compas style with more modern, keyboard-driven sounds of zouk from Guadeloupe. The band members also throw in American pop. But the best music the band plays, oddly, is the older Haitian style, which is pure dance music, unadulterated by all the various pulls and tugs of the star system. And like many of the younger bands, Rara Machine is interested in roots; it is not afraid to use carnival and voodoo rhythms in the music. The show starts at 11 tonight; the cover charge is $17.

This reunion tour, promoting a new album on Epitaph that sounds more like the band's original punk than the speed metal it helped invent, has him baring his tattoos and spouting his live-free-or-die rants for a new brood of sweaty young fans, as the guitarist Vinnie Stigmata kicks out the jams.

Otis Clay pleads and sweats and gets down on his knees and generally acts like a soul singer, which he is. There aren't too many of them making the rounds anymore, and Mr. Clay gives genre addicts the sounds they need, smooth and raw and, above all, Southern: relaxed and yet intense.

Arthur Taylor, one of the most recorded jazz drummers in the 1950's and 60's, has put together what may be the most exciting group working in jazz today. With Vincent Herring and Willie Williams on saxophones, Larry Willis on piano and Tyler Mitchell on bass, the band works through complicated arrangements to get to some of the most intense interplay to be found in New York City's clubs.

That means they're likely to play anything from modal jazz to suspended-time ballads to high-speed, harmonically daunting zigzags, and they'll be on their toes because the music is being recorded by Candid Records. The group includes Donald Harrison and Ricky Ford on saxophones, Claudio Roditi on trumpet, Kenny Barron on piano, Larry Gales on bass and Joe Chambers on drums.

Tomorrow at 10:30 P.M.; admission is $8. Week's Caribbean Album     Our Boys Steel Orchestra: Pan Progress (Mango). Too many steel bands sound magnificent when they march but somehow lose both their best songs and their impact in the recording studio. That doesn't happen to Our Boys, a 13-member group from Trinidad and Tobago that is based in San Francisco. \\"Pan Progress\\" captures the joyous propulsion of modern steel-band soca. The pieces, most of them written by Len (Boogsie) Sharpe, shimmer and strut, with one ebullient melody unfolding, then another and another. Andy Narell, the new-age musician who produced the album, contributes a piece that tries modern-jazz harmonies (with a nod to Herbie Hancock's \\"Maiden Voyage\\"), then wisely abandons them for more lighthearted melodies. A few ballads allow Our Boys (who include one woman) to demonstrate their orchestral blend. But by far the best part of the album is its uptempo songs; music doesn't get much happier.

Marty Ehrlich, who plays about every known reed instrument, drags the best out of the period, mixing lyricism with emptiness and concise ensemble work that values the collective over the individual with a spacious sense of group improvisation. The last time he led a group like this, including Wayne Horvitz on piano, Anthony Cox on bass, and Andrew Cyrille on drums, it was a special occasion.

In 1963, in Puerto Rico, German Rosario, a hill-country singer, put together a small masterpiece of an album using a few stringed instruments, a clarinet and a handful of drums. The album exudes delicacy. Cultures clash: the Spanish tradition (with inflections of flamenco) comes across in the song structures and the topics, which range from severe despair to deathly depression. But the African percussion, the riffs and the improvisation bring the music a lightness that makes the contradiction not just palatable, but energizing as well.

Tonight, a double bill of acoustic-guitar blues brings back proven New York favorites: the Piedmont blues duo of John Cephas and Phil Wiggins, whose fingerpicked guitar and harmonica and hearty vocal harmonies come from the same tradition as Sonny McGhee and Brownie Terry, and Larry Johnson, whose syncopated fingerpicking has a strong streak of ragtime.

As with most industrial noise dance bands, Front 242's music is usually better live than on record. The band's music, produced by samplers and sequencers, can sound great coming through a huge sound system, filled with whispers and squeeks amid the roar. Voices mumble in the background, and everything is ominous and vaguely antiauthoritarian. It's a teen-ager's view of an alienating, authority-filled world.

The first innovation Bo Diddley devised was to take what he'd learned playing classical violin -- ''choking the strings,'' as the critic Robert Palmer once called it -- and apply it to playing guitar. Thus, some say, funk was born. And Mr. Diddley's innovations just kept propagating. He designed and built his own instruments, experimented with amplified distortion, mixed urban myths and African-inspired legends in his lyrics and made the maracas a major part of rock-and-roll. Most famously, he created an approach to rhythm that is one of rock-and-roll's foundation stones. And he's still the master of the form. Johnny Allen also performs.

Opera    ''SUMMER,'' Edith Wharton's 1917 novella ''Summer,'' a story of the sexual awakening of Charity Royall, taken at an early age from a rural enclave of backward Berkshire Mountain people and raised by a self-righteous lawyer in a drab, small-minded town, has been turned into an opera by the composer Stephen Paulus and the librettist Joan Vail Thorne. The world premiere production is by the Berkshire Opera Company, which is fitting not just because of the story's setting but because of Wharton's close ties to the Berkshires. The libretto is efficient but overly poetic, and the opulently lyrical music can sometimes sound generic. The ambiguities in Wharton's telling of the story are not captured in the score. But the production is handsome and dramatically effective, and the cast, with the mezzo-soprano Margaret Lattimore as Charity, is impressive. Tomorrow night at 8.

Those songs, which include the verbally nonsensical \\"Howdy Doo\\" and the comic \\"Don't You Push Me Down,\\" were originally written and recorded 40 years ago by Guthrie for his three children. They were recently rerecorded to allow the family to sing along. Shows are tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $15 to $22.

Like most jokes, Black Velvet Flag gets less and less funny with each telling. The band plays sedate lounge-music versions of raucous punk-rock classics by California bands like the Germs, Black Flag and the Circle Jerks. Occasionally, the band tosses a few similarly anomalous original songs into their straight-faced performances. James Chance, on the other hand, is the real thing. A survivor of New York's noisy no-wave scene of the late 1970's, Mr. Chance continues to merge punk, funk and free jazz. While John Lurie, the star of several of Jim Jarmusch's films, is informed by punk and lounge music, he will probably be looking to avant-garde jazz and pop music for his smart, sometimes noisy saxophone playing during this rare solo performance.

This might be one of the only nights to see these two bands without getting jostled and nudged by myriad talent scouts looking to sign them to a record label. The Friggs are four women who play garage rock that hits as hard as surf music and swings as much as rockabilly. Jackass is a group of men who have an edge on other bands that play disaffected guitar grunge: its lead singer would look good on a magazine cover.

Maxwell's capacity is probably less than that of a New Year's Eve party in a Manhattan studio, but if a sense of community and a strong, mixed-bag lineup of alternative rock is what you're looking for, then look no further. Rocket From the Crypt is a band from San Diego that mixes pop contrivances with punk-rock spontaneity, the Swingin' Neckbreakers play melodic, high-energy garage rock that seems untouched by any musical innovation since 1965 and Portastatic is the name for Mac McCaughan of Superchunk's side project, which plays pensive solo songs and slow-building group rockers.

It begins at 9 P.M. on New Year's Eve and ends on noon the next day.

En route to the Mississippi Delta, this Detroit trio must have taken a wrong turn at Albuquerque: the Gories' harum-scarum version of punk, blues and rockabilly is as beat-up and dented as a roadside wreck. Lines like \\"Thunderbird ESQ/I love it more than I love you\\" are delivered with a laconic snarl and a sick sense of humor by the lead singer and guitarist Mick, while the second guitarist Dan ekes out a solo containing all of two notes, and the drummer Peg pounds out a tribal rhythm on her floor tom. (All members go by first names only.) Live, the proceedings take on the aura of macabre theater: Mick usually leaves his sunglasses on, as though lurking behind them were eyes that might pop out of their sockets in true B-movie horror-show fashion.

If the computerized rhythms and heavy bass riffs of reggae dancehall helped break down the barriers between reggae and modern club music, then Shabba Ranks further tears away the distinctions between reggae and hip-hop. His voice is a blur of pops, bops and throat catches, squeezing syllables into beats at machine-gun speed. The music is tough and spare, as if he's more concerned with drilling his words into your head than giving you a deep groove to wallow in. With Crystal and Coco Tea.

The Week's Rock Album     Meat Puppets: \\"Forbidden Places\\" (London). The Meat Puppets play hard rock for people with soft minds: No matter how fast the guitar solos or how heavy the power chords, this Arizona trio displays a fundamental lack of the aggression usually associated with the genre. Flooded with trippy, naturalistic images like \\"On this day we were miles away/We saw a clock up in the sky,\\" the Puppets' lyrics are better suited to the realities of the inner world than the outer; their preferred roots idiom is country rather than blues, which means the ballads come in three-quarter time. After seven records with the California independent label SST, \\"Forbidden Places\\" is the band's first release on a major label, and the producer Pete Anderson (who has also worked with Dwight Yoakam and Michelle Shocked) keeps the sound more focused, less indulgent, than in the past.

For many American music listeners, Irish means traditional -- penny whistles, trilling vocals, verses dripping poetic wax about the long green hills and the ghosts that wander them. But Irish people -- and this decade's new wave of Irish immigrants to this country -- care more about the state of their nation now, as it struggles with old values and a new cosmopolitanism. Mary Black is the most popular singer in that Ireland, her voice a plain instrument suited to everyday observations, which she finds in contemporary ballads that ponder how history burdens and sustains the present. Sharing the bill with her is Andy White, a Belfast native whose red-blooded folk rock updates the country's timeworn troubled zeitgeist for a new generation.

Over the last three years, Fat Possum Records, a small label in Mississippi, has been releasing documents of northern Mississippi blues, valuable for cultural reasons but even more so because the music is so good. The northern Mississippi blues tradition is pretty obscure, and it's all about repetition and droning, about the subtle colorations of rhythm that trance music needs to be effective. The 66-year-old guitarist R. L. Burnside plays a music surprisingly different from the standard Chicago blues that makes the fraternity-house-and-blues circuit. For one, his tunes rarely stray beyond a chord or two. More important, the performances are improvised rhythmically; songs could last all night, with no complaints from anyone.

June 9    TRACY CHAPMAN, MAJEK FASHEK AND BLACK 47, Beacon Theater, Broadway and 74th Street, Manhattan, (212) 496-7070. On Tracy Chapman's latest album, \\"Matters of the Heart,\\" she lends her deep, somber voice to songs on personal as well as political topics. But her opening acts -- the Nigerian reggae singer Majek Fashek and the Irish-American rock band Black 47 -- suggest that politics is still on the agenda.

All great in their prime, all worthy of a good living now that their hairstyles and arty sensibilities aren't exactly in fashion, these bands will surely still deliver fun and many sweeping gestures in concert.

He's a hero to an underground nation of obsessives: ÒcultÓ barely begins to describe what he's got. And no one can sing a swooning ballad over a straightlaced punk-inspired riff the way Morrissey can -- in fact, few other singers would be brave (or foolish) enough to try. His new album, ''You Are the Quarry'' (Attack/Sanctuary/BMG), has too many songs that meander forward without tunes strong enough to match the conceits, but the best one, ''First of the Gang to Die,'' is classic Morrissey: coy and elusive and unexpectedly macho, with joy shining through the bitternes.

It's hard to picture the band, now down to a woodwinds-bass-drums trio, without Bowie's comic presence, which always balanced out the saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell's formalism.

Running through her hefty catalog of hits, Ms. Blige belts, moans and testifies about love lost or worth losing, and her soul sisters in the audience moan and belt right back.

They are the most recent work of the 87-year-old artist Reuben Nakian and his first effort ever at creating a stage design.   ''It was a lot of fun,'' Mr. Nakian said of making the stage set, which consists of large white cardboard cutouts of Greek amphorae, temple columns and plain rectangular shapes on which are painted Greek goddesses and nymphs - often caught in romantic embrace with a swan, a cloud or a bull.

Gangsta rap's commercial momentum has moved to the East Coast with No. 1 albums by Jay-Z and DMX. For all the strife, threats, contempt for women and other testosterone-fueled excesses in the lyrics, in concert the raps become party music, a celebration of survival despite desperate odds. Jay-Z tosses off rapid-fire rhymes with easy efficiency (and a lot of help from his fans); DMX growls his tales of loyalty and bloodshed, then follows up with a sincere prayer. Method Man and Redman, sharing their set, mix apocalyptic warnings with comedy. Sunday at 8 P.M.; tickets are $26.50 and $36.50 (Pareles).   * ROBERT EARL KEEN, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Flatiron district, (212) 727-7788. A local hero in Texas, Robert Earl Keen writes songs about dusty trails, border towns, gunfights, robbery sprees and moving on. His songs crack sly jokes, tell stories and seek out romance, sometimes all at once, as in his masterpiece, \\"The Road Goes On Forever.\\" His tattered, weary voice covers some gruff sentimentality. Reckless Kelly opens tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $15 (Pareles).   DAVID KRAKAUER'S KLEZMER MADNESS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. In a club that used to be the cellar of a kosher winery, the clarinetist David Krakauer updates klezmer music to reflect New York in the 1990's. Sunday at 1:30 and 3 P.M.; admission is $10 for one set, $15 for two (Pareles).   ROY LONEY, Continental, 25 Third Avenue, at St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 529-6924. As rockabilly revivals have crested and ebbed, Roy Loney, who was with the Flamin' Groovies from the late 1960's to 1975, has stuck to the style, staying loyal to its twang and swagger. Tonight at 11:15 P.M.; admission is $7 (Pareles).   * LABOR OF LOVE: THE LIFE OF SARAH VAUGHAN, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. One of the unquestionable virtuosos of jazz, the Newark native Sarah Vaughan would have turned 75 tomorrow. A Jersey-centric lineup has been assembled to pay tribute, including Frank Foster's Loud Minority Big Band, the singers Andy Bey and Marlena Shaw and the poet Amiri Baraka. The show is tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $10 to $44 (Ratliff).   MORPHINE, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Mark Sandman has a voice that is deep like the bottom of a lake where bodies are dumped, a voice that specializes in comical horror stories and morbid jokes. He plays an instrument, the two-string slide bass, that talks as if it's his twin. Lately he's been fiddling around on a hybrid bass-and-guitar, which adds range to the conversation. For companionship, he signed up his main musical partner, the baritone saxophonist Dana Colley. And so one of the most distinctive musical tangents in post-punk began. Morphine, from Boston, is not supporting a new album with this show, just heading to town for the fun ot it. Mr. Airplane Man and Hub share the bill. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $17.50 (Powers).   WOLFGANG MUTHSPIEL TRIO, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Mr. Muthspiel, a guitarist who has played in Paul Motian's electric be-bop quintet, has a lot of ideas about what jazz can sound like; he's recorded solo pieces on acoustic guitar, with samplers, in duets with percussionists, with regular jazz trios and quintets. He plays through Sunday night, with sets at 9 and 11; there's also a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow. Cover charge is $20, with a $10 minimum at all shows (Ratliff).   TITO NIEVES, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-2672. Mr. Nieves is called the Pavarotti of salsa, a big man with a big sound. He's a gifted improviser, with his own set of melodies and a long history of hits to draw on, from his own career and from his time with the band Conjunto Clasico. He'll share the stage with Raulin Rosendo, a Dominican Republic salsa singer with his own string of hits. Tomorrow's show starts at 11:30 P.M.; the cover is $20 for men and $15 for women (Watrous).   * NORDIC FIDDLE FESTIVAL, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400) or (212) 545-7536. Far from the fiddle strongholds of Ireland and Scotland are traditions that sound like far-flung Celtic kinfolk, and fiddlers devoted to three of them share this program: Annbjorg Lien of Norway (who plays the hardangar, a fiddle with resonating sympathetic strings), Vasen from Sweden (a group featuring the nyckelharpa, a keyed fiddle that is cranked like a hurdy-gurdy) and the group J.P.P. from Finland. Tomorrow at 8 P.M.; tickets are $25 and $30 (Pareles).   ORCHESTRE TROPICANA D'HAITI, S.O.B's, 204 Varick Street, SoHo, (212)  243-5062. What a treat: the band makes it to the United States from Haiti once or twice a year, providing the region beyond Manhattan with the cool, relaxed grooves of old-style compa. Tropicana, as it's known, is the product of the 1950's: luxuriant, confident and elegant. The guitar and keyboard parts intertwine under the horn riffs, and the chorus permutates endlessly. And they make it to Manhattan seemingly once a decade. Take advantage of the show. Shows are tonight at 11 and 1 A.M.; there's an $18 cover charge and a $15 minimum at the tables (Watrous).   OVERKILL, Coney Island High, 15 St. Marks Place, East Village (212) 674-7959. Still thrashing 14 years after their first album, Overkill stays true to the speed-metal basics of the 1980's: grinding and pounding, sputtering and growling, occasionally letting a melody break into the mayhem. Tonight at 9; admission is $12 (Pareles).   * NIAMH PARSONS, Blarney Star, 43 Murray Street, lower Manhattan, (212) 732-2873. In a voice filled with sweet melancholy and stately passion, Niamh Parsons sings traditional Irish songs of love and war, making ancient tales of weeping maidens and homesick sailors sound tender and immediate. Sharing the bill is Josephine Marsh, a button accordionist from County Clare, accompanied by her brother Pat on bouzouki. Tonight at 9 and 10:30; admission to each show is $10 (Pareles).   DAVID POE, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. There's a certain type of sensitive guy who woos women by listening to them, or at least making them think he's listening as he gazes deeply into their eyes over his espresso. David Poe makes sweet, sultry pop in this persona, writing about failed connections and melancholy wishes in a style somewhere between the folk-pop of his mentor, T-Bone Burnett, and the slickly intelligent balladry of Duncan Sheik. With Lianne Smith and Bubble. Tonight at 8; tickets are $10 (Powers).   THE ROOTS, Roseland, 239 West 52d Street, Manhattan, (212) 247-0200 or (212) 777-6800.  The band that most hip-hop fans consider the best live act in the genre has finally made an impact on the radio with the sultry title track from its new album, \\"Things Fall Apart\\"; it's the one drifting out of your radio like patchouli, with Erykah Badu's vocal chorus adding a hint of citrus. So this party should be particularly spirited. Expect the usual sultry grooves, flowing rhymes and fabulous guest stars. Tonight at 8; tickets are $22.50 (Powers).   * CESAR ROSAS, Shine, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, lower Manhattan, (212) 941-0900. As a member of Los Lobos, Cesar Rosas is the band's blues mainstay, growling his vocals and playing wiry, pointed lead guitar. He has just made a solo album, \\"Soul Disguise\\" (Rykodisc), that bounces from folk-rock to Mexican-American cumbia to New Orleans funk, still touching down regularly in the blues. Tonight, with Paul Cebar's blues band opening at 9:15; admission is $15 (Pareles).   JEFFREY SCHANZER, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793. The composer Jeffrey Schanzer has long combined rock guitar with contemporary classical and jazz ideas. His new work, \\"The Past Is Present,\\" is a multimedia cantata about Holocaust survivors and their children. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; admission is $15 (Pareles).   JIMMY SMITH QUARTET AND GENE HARRIS, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. Two deep groovers, Mr. Smith on organ and Mr. Harris on piano but playing as if it were an organ. They both  summon an era when jazz was still, in some form or another, the popular music of blacks. Sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11:30 P.M. The cover charge is $30, and the minimum is $5 (Watrous).   VERSUS, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. A local club perennial, Versus specializes in honeyed fuzz rock shaped into pensive songs that gently meld with a listener's thoughts rather than intruding on them. Bookworms love this stuff. With French. Tomorrow night at 7:30 and 10:30; tickets are $10 (Powers).   STEVE WYNN, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. A hero of the mid-1980's post-punk rock revival, Steve Wynn has made a career of taking the advice of his hero, Bob Dylan, not to look back. For a traditionalist, he is steadfastly experimental, always trying new settings and structures for his basic, rootsy, guitar rock. With Peter Salett and Eric America. Tonight at 11; tickets are $8 (Powers). POP AND JAZZ GUIDE  Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in New York City this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.   DAN BERN, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Could Dan Bern be more obnoxious? He wails about the colossal size of his private anatomy, suggests that humanity originated with a sex act between aliens and monkeys, praises his female peers as ''chick singers'' and brings up uncomfortable subjects like racial separatism and the still mythical cure for AIDS. He earns the right to cause this trouble by being genuinely witty, often touching and just a heck of a fun guy to be around. His albums haven't yet totally captured the daring of his live performances, in which Mr. Bern lives up to the legacy of his idol, Lenny Bruce, by pushing himself and his audience in directions even he never expected. Tomorrow night at 7:30 and 10:30; tickets are $15 (Ann Powers)."},{"year":"1985","title":"The keyboardist Bernie Worrell, formerly with Parliament-Funkadelic and the Talking Heads, will lead his own funk and rock band tonight and tomorrow at the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, at Mercer Street (228-7880).

Dorothy Donegan, a throwback to the days when jazz musicians were often a part of show business, has managed to combine her showmanship with musical virtuosity and a strong jazz sensitivity, a combination that often blinded jazz purists to her skills. Now approaching 70, she is usually not as rambunctious as she once was, but she can still turn on the heat when she wants to. To help her shift into various moods, her trio includes her longtime drummer, Ray Mosca, who understands every twist of her fingers and every stomp of her foot. With Jerome Hunter on bass, they play tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M. The cover charge is $15 and the minimum is $8 tonight and tomorrow. On Sunday the cover is $12 but the minimum is still $8. Volatile Sounds    Versus and Scrawl, the Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-3055. Buzzing, droning, ticking and pounding, Versus plays rock songs that implode. All of a sudden, calm declarations like \\"I don't care\\" are torn apart by jagged guitar chords and bursts of noise, as if social decorum could no longer contain emotional turmoil. Scrawl, a long-running college-circuit band, plays scruffy, straightforward tales of troubled romance and day-to-day tension.

I heard that one of America's oldest penitentiaries is in Philadelphia. Is it open to visitors? -- Jono Maineli, New York, N.Y.     A. Eastern State Penitentiary, a national historic landmark, is an imposing stone fortress sitting on 10 acres in the center of Philadelphia. Opened in 1829, it set a precedent, said Sean Kelley, program director, because every inmate was kept in solitary confinement -- a Quaker-inspired concept.     The building's design, by John Haviland, is unusual as well. The original 250 cells were entered only from the back -- through individual exercise yards -- and featured running water, toilets and skylights to provide ''light from heaven,'' according to the prison's Web site. The building is set up like a wheel, with a central observation rotunda in the middle and the seven cellblock corridors branching off. The walls are 30 feet tall and 12 feet thick, with barrel-vaulted ceilings and arched windows. Two of the penitentiary's most famous inmates were Al Capone, who spent eight months there in 1929, and Willie Sutton, the bank robber, who took part in an ultimately unsuccessful escape through a tunnel in 1945.     By the early 1970's, Eastern State had closed, Mr. Kelley said. In 1994 the city began offering tours and various programs including a large flea market (May 3) and art installations. The annual Halloween fright nights have become Eastern State's greatest source of funds, Mr. Kelley said. This year the special Terror Behind the Walls event takes place from Oct. 3 to Nov. 2","excerpt":"tickets cost $13 to $20. In 2002, 64,000 people visited Eastern State, 40,000 during the Halloween season.     There are a few changes this year, Mr. Kelley said. A new roof over the rotunda means visitors no longer have to wear hard hats, and the catwalk on Cell Block 7 will be open. Another innovation, Mr. Kelley said, is the introduction of a digital audio tour narrated by Steve Buscemi, the actor. All of which means an increase in admission price to $9. Eastern State, which is at 2124 Fairmount Avenue, is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday to Sunday from April to November for individual tours; group tours are offered year-round. The museum is a short cab ride from Penn Station at 30th Street. For more information, call (215) 236-3300 or go to www.easternstate.org.    The Palaces of Sintra    Q. We will be visiting Lisbon in May and would like to visit the palaces of Sintra. Any suggestions? -- D.S. and T.S., Winchester, Mass.     A. Sintra is 18 miles northwest of Lisbon. Among the most celebrated palaces are the Sintra National Palace (Pal&#225;cio Nacional de Sintra), in the town's Old Quarter, (351-21) 910-68-40. This palace dates back to the 15th century and is distinguished by its conical chimneys. It is closed on Wednesdays; admission is $3.30 (0.94 euros to the dollar).    Another popular site is the Pena National Palace and Park, (351-21) 910-53-40. Built in the 19th century it includes a 16th-century altar and collections of decorative arts. The palace is closed on Mondays; admission is $5.60.    Another palace in Sintra is the Queluz National Palace, (351-21) 435-00-39. Some consider this 18th-century palace a small Versailles. Closed on Tuesdays; admission $3.30. Regaleira Palace and Gardens, (351-21) 910-66-50 or 59, is an eclectic design by Luigi Manini, completed in 1910, but the grounds date back to 1697. Admission is $11 for a guided tour, $5.60 unguided.     For more information, see Sintra's Web site, www.cm-sintra.pt. Be aware that May 1 is a major holiday.    The Portuguese National Tourist Office is at 590 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10036, (212) 354-4403, www.portugalinsite.com; in Sintra, call the tourist office at (351-21) 923-11-57 or (351-21) 924-17-00.    Returning to Guadeloupe    Q. About 20 years ago I spent a delightful week on Guadeloupe. I wanted to visit again but can't find any information about it. -- Irma M. Leeds, Paramus, N.J.        A. Tourist-oriented development is among the big changes you will find in Guadeloupe, an overseas d&#233;partement of France in the Caribbean, where the euro is the coin of the realm, according to Guy-Claude Germain, director of public relations for Guadeloupe. But the population (about 430,000) remains a vibrant mix of cultures -- European, African and East Indian.    Since your last trip, a major road has been built from Pointe-&#224;-Pitre, site of the Guadeloupe International Airport and a major cruise ship port, to Basse-Terre, the island's capital, reducing the driving time to half an hour. There has also been a great increase in the number of hotel rooms, Mr. Germain said. In the 1960's, he said, the island had no more than 500 hotel rooms; today there are 4,700, most based on the more developed Grand-Terre part of the island.    Among the hotel options on Guadeloupe (all rates listed here are double occupancy) are the 11-year-old, all-suite Le Meridien La Cocoteraie, Avenue de l'Europe, 97118 St.-Fran&#231;ois, Guadeloupe, (590-590) 88.79.81, fax (590-590) 88.78.33 or online at www.antilles-info-tourisme.com/guadeloupe/coco-gb.htm. La Cocoteraie is the only hotel on the island facing a golf course, Mr. Germain said. It has 52 suites, a restaurant and a pool in which patrons can swim up to a bar for drinks. Summer rates (May to November) are $542 a night, including breakfast; winter rates are $1,069 a night.    La Cr&#233;ole Beach Hotel (part of a three-hotel resort by the same name), is at Pointe de la Verdure, 97190 Gosier, Guadeloupe, (590-590) 90.46.66, fax (590-590) 90.46.66; www.leader-hotels.gp. The hotel is between Basse-Terre and Grande-Terre and has 156 rooms (384 in the entire resort), with a pool, restaurants and shopping. The summer rates are $156 a night; winter rates are $251 a night.    Canella Beach H&#244;tel R&#233;sidence, Pointe de la Verdure, B.P. 73, 97190, Gosier, Guadeloupe, (590- 590) 90.44.00, fax (590-590) 90.44.44; www.canellabeach.com, offers 145 studios and duplex apartments with balconies. Summer rates are $126 a night; winter rates are $179 a night.     For more help see www.antilles-info-tourisme.com or fax the tourist office at (590) 590-83.89.22.

SPARE TIMES"},{"year":"2006","title":"NORTH DAKOTA in the winter -- cold, you betcha. But in Grand Forks, a town of about 50,000 closer to Winnipeg than it is to Minneapolis, winter is not a forbidding season. There's plenty to do outdoors if you're up for it, but because Grand Forks is home to the University of North Dakota and its more than 13,000 students, there's a surprising number of things to do indoors as well. The people are remarkably friendly, perhaps the result of working together to hold back the Red River of the North, which last flooded in 1997 and would have destroyed the city were it not for the legions of hyperorganized volunteer sandbaggers. And while a majority of the inhabitants trace their ancestry to Norway or Germany, the Forks has grown more diverse with the increasing number of university students from overseas. Finally, consider the joke that Grand Forks played on Dave Barry when he ridiculed the city's efforts to promote tourism. Lured to the Forks by a postcard-writing campaign, he was the guest of honor at an official ceremony in 2002-- in which a municipal sewage pump station was named after him. The plaque at the site reads ''Dave Barry Lift Station No. 16.''   NEAL KARLEN    Friday    4 p.m.  1 -- Add the Pickle    Check in to the Hilton Garden Inn Grand Forks (4301 James Ray Drive, 701-775-6000) on the campus of the University of North Dakota and enjoy a swim and a hot tub. Then go to the lobby bar and get a bloody mary ($3.75), which will come with a pickle, as is the custom in the upper Midwest. After you've eaten it, you can grab another pickle from the bar. If you're feeling peckish for something warm that you can have right away, frozen Hot Pockets are available at the front desk for $2. It might make Conrad Hilton roll over in his grave, but the person at the check-in counter will smilingly volunteer instructions for heating them in your room's microwave.    5:30 p.m.  2 -- The Eiger Sanction    If you want a fine dining experience, a terrific choice is Sanders 1907, named after Sander Johnson, who built the original two-story warehouse in 1907 (and whose granddaughter converted the first floor into a restaurant in 1982). That building was severely damaged in the Red River flood of 1997, but the restaurant has been rebuilt nearby (22 South Third Street, 701-746-8970). It's best to call ahead for reservations, not because they're so fancy-shmancy in this almost always laid-back town, but so seating times can be staggered to allow the chefs to devote full attention to a menu that includes Swiss Eiger steak (Sanders's name for prime rib), crab cakes, walleye and buffalo meat. Entrees run $15 to $31. And don't forget to check out the Dakota-length bar and Wild West pool room.    7:30 p.m.  3 -- Hockey Night in Grand Forks    In 1998, the University of North Dakota accepted a pledge of $100 million from Ralph Engelstad, an alumnus who owned a Las Vegas casino where he staged Third Reich dress-up parties on Hitler's birthday. Mr. Engelstad's donation was to endow construction of a lavish rink for the pride of the university athletic program, its hockey team. Two years later, when the university considered changing its Fighting Sioux nickname, Mr. Engelstad decided to fight the scourge of political correctness by threatening to halt work on the half-finished building. The university relented, and today the Ralph Engelstad Arena is perhaps the most beautiful college hockey rink in the world -- and the main attraction in Grand Forks on a winter weekend evening. Forget for a few hours that the late Mr. Engelstad's name is on the marquee and marvel at the granite-lined floors, halls and restrooms, 300 closed-circuit televisions, 48 luxury suites and perfect sight lines for around 11,000 shrieking fans who come to cheer the only big-time sport in the state. The West regional of the N.C.A.A. hockey tournament will be held there March 24 and 25 (www.theralph.com, 877-917-4689","excerpt":"tickets, $21.50).    10 p.m.  4 -- Casino Boreal    Grand Forks isn't Vegas, or even the Indian reservations with their slots-blackjack-and-poker palaces just across the river in Minnesota. But there are still plenty of places in town where you can legally drop a bundle by hitting on 16 while playing 21 or buying too many bingo cards to keep track of at once. In Grand Forks, you'll find casinos in a variety of places (all run, according to state law, by nonprofit organizations, including the Greater Grand Forks Convention and Visitors Bureau): Big Daddy's Lounge, which is also an off-sale liquor store, (1405 DeMers Avenue, 701-775-7740); Dagwood's Bar and Grill, a saloon serving bar food (425 North 42nd Street, 701-772-8044); or Charlie Brown's Casino, which has three tables for blackjack and about 200 seats for bingo (414 Gateway Drive, 701-772-7620).    Saturday    9 a.m.  5 -- After the Whiteout    The convention and visitors bureau calls the area a ''winter wonderland,'' which is one way to think of the eight blizzards whose snowmelt led to the great flood of April 1997. Still, there's terrific snowshoeing and cross-country skiing in Grand Forks, and only a weenie wouldn't go outside. The best venues are the Greenway, which runs alongside the Red River, including loops of groomed trails at Lincoln Drive Park -- or on the frozen river itself. For ski rentals, as well as directions, contact University of North Dakota Lifetimes Sports Center (701-777-3981) or one of the several other sports shops.    1 p.m.  6 -- Drawing on Disaster    The North Dakota Museum of Art (261 Centennial Drive on the University of North Dakota campus, 701-777-4195; www.ndmoa.com), shows contemporary work and has a fine collection of contemporary American Indian art. The first of a three-part exhibition of the museum's holdings runs to March 12. This show highlights 11 artists from locales as diverse as Cuba, Notre Dame University in Indiana and the White Earth reservation in Minnesota. Included is art from Douglas Kinsey, whose usual theme is disaster, a defining topic on the Great Plains, represented by apocalyptic paintings, while Frank Bigbear Jr.'s drawing ''Dolly's Discothèque'' considers traditional Indian life assimilating into urban American culture.    3 p.m.  7 -- Empire of the Arts    Housed in the refurbished movie palace where Al Jolson and ''The Jazz Singer'' first brought talkies to Grand Forks, the Empire Arts Center (415 DeMers Avenue; 701-746-5500; www.empireartscenter.com) stages events that reflect the surprising eclecticism of local sensibilities. ''The Vagina Monologues'' played from Feb. 2 to 4, while the Miss Grand Forks Pageant will take place Feb. 19.    5:30 p.m.  8 -- North of the Border    Mexican Village (1218 South Washington Street, 701-775-3653) is Grand Forks's first restaurant serving south-of-the-border specialties. Yet a characteristically homey North Dakotan atmosphere prevails, as does a typically North Dakotan take on Mexican cuisine -- like the chicken burrito, which is served slathered with the kind of Midwestern homemade gravy that normally covers biscuits. An average dinner for two is about $16.    7:30 p.m.  9 -- Red River Symphony    The Greater Grand Forks Symphony Orchestra (701-777-3359, online at www.grandforkssymphony.org) is in its 97th season. A full 60-piece orchestra, it performs in various local venues, like the Empire Arts Center and the Alerus Center, a convention center large enough to stage Fighting Sioux football games. The symphony's next performance is March 9 at the Chester Fritz Auditorium on the university campus.    Sunday    9 a.m.  10 -- A Grill Named Sioux    In the land of family values, there is nothing like a hearty home-style breakfast at a 24-hour restaurant, the Big Sioux Cafe (4401 32nd Avenue South, 701-738-0441), which features lumberjack breakfasts that would fill Paul Bunyan and the Brawny Man together. The most popular item: the Trucker Special ($6.95), green peppers, onions, cheese, mushrooms, ham, bacon and sausage, all atop hash browns and the whole mélange crowned by two eggs.    Noon  11 -- Northern Air    Grand Forks Air Force Base, about 16 miles west of town, is home to the 319th Air Refueling Wing and its KC-135 Stratotankers, famed for their midair plane-to-plane refueling maneuvers. Even if you can't arrange a tour, you can see B-25, A-26 and B-52 bombers, an F-101 fighter and a Minuteman III missile, all used at one time at the base, out front. Call at least three weeks ahead to set up a tour (701-747-5023; public.grandforks.amc.af.mil/basetour.asp).    THE BASICS    Where Drinks Come With Pickles       Amtrak's Empire Builder train, which runs between Chicago and Seattle, stops twice a day in Grand Forks (800-872-7245, www.amtrak.com). Planes arrive at Grand Forks International Airport (701-795-6981, www.gfkairport.com) several times a day from Minneapolis on Northwest and its affiliated airlines. All major car rental agencies serve Grand Forks, as well as two taxi services: Nodak Radio Cab (701-772-3456) and Grand Forks Taxi (701-780-8890).     The Hilton Garden Inn Grand Forks, on the campus of the University of North Dakota, offers 100 rooms from $84 a night (4301 James Ray Drive, 701-775-6000; www.hiltongardeninn.com).      For a non-Hilton experience, try the 511 Reeves Bed and Breakfast, a converted 1901 Victorian mansion a block from the river. Though it has only three guest rooms, each bears a distinct personality: the wildlife-themed Audubon Room has noncreepy examples of taxidermy; the quaint Americana Room; and the wistful Cottage Room, meant to evoke images of childhood (511 Reeves Drive; 701-775-3585, www.bbonline.com/nd/511reeves; rooms are $89 to $99). 36 Hours in Grand Forks, N.D."},{"year":"2004","title":"A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.

Stock succeeded the orchestra's founder, Theodore Thomas, as music director and served for 36 years.

Meanwhile, President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan and Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India both headed for a regional conference in Kazakhstan, where President Vladimir Putin of Russia has offered to serve as a broker in a meeting between them.   A1    Israel Backs Military Option  As Israeli forces swept through the West Bank city of Nablus for a third day, the country's leaders said that unilateral military action was the best path to security. George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, is scheduled to visit Israel to promote an overhaul of the Palestinian security forces that would make them more effective at blocking violence against Israel. But with Israeli troops raiding Palestinian areas regularly, the notion of cooperation between the Israeli and Palestinian security forces has been all but abandoned.   A4       Arrests in Mexico Killings  Sixteen people were jailed in Mexico on suspicion of killing 26 villagers from rural Oaxaca in a vendetta over land. The suspects were residents of nearby villages that have fought the people of Santiago Xochiltepec for many years. A state prosecutor said he had not ruled out the possibility that the massacre had its roots in a fight between low-level drug traffickers.

Abortions will be allowed in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, provided the woman requests the procedure in writing and agrees to counseling and medical advice.

A1    Perils of a Prosecution Witness  Essam Al Ridi, a former federal witness, helped convict a Qaeda member early last year in connection with a plot to bomb American embassies. But since then, Mr. Al Ridi said, he has faced reprisals, including a detention during a trip home to Egypt, and the loss of his job with a Middle Eastern airline. He sees his treatment as a sign of potential perils facing Arabs and Muslims who assist the F.B.I. in the war on terror.   A1    A Shift on Global Warming  In a stark shift for the Bush administration, the United States has sent a report to the United Nations detailing far-reaching effects that it says global warming will inflict on the American environment. The administration for the first time places most of the blame for recent global warming on human actions. But while the report says the environment will be changed substantially in the next few decades, it does not advocate major changes in administration policy on greenhouse gases.   A1    Candidates Clash in Alabama  For the last 10 years, the all-but-invulnerable occupant of Alabama's Seventh Congressional District seat has been Earl F. Hilliard, the state's first black representative since Reconstruction. But Mr. Hilliard suddenly finds himself battling for his political life against a lawyer, Artur Davis, in a Democratic primary contest that is getting dirtier by the day.   A10    When Faith and Zoning Collide  A federal law enacted in 2000 prohibits zoning regulations that impose a substantial burden on religious exercise unless the government can show that there is a compelling interest in doing so, and that there is no less restrictive option. The measure has unleashed a torrent of litigation.   A10    A Shrinking Shrimp Market  Shrimpers in Louisiana's Cajun country are facing prices at the pier that are lower than they have been in decades. Demand has suffered through an economic hangover and a post-Sept. 11 plunge in travel and entertainment spending.   A13    Studying Cloning's Potential  Cows implanted with cells taken from a cloned embryo did not experience immune rejection, showing the potential of therapeutic cloning, researchers said. The technology is opposed by many, but some scientists who oppose the cloning of humans say that therapeutic cloning should be pursued because it could supply healthy tissue to treat a variety of illnesses.   A11    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Studies Say Welfare Rules May Discourage Marriage  Just as the White House is seeking welfare legislation with more stringent work requirements and more support for marriage, new research findings in Connecticut and Iowa show that the stricter rules significantly reduce the chances that a single mother will wed.   A1    Harbor on a Hard Drive  Over the next decade, millions of tons of silt, sand and muck must be dredged from New York Harbor to keep the port competitive. Knowing what is in that mud, how it moves and where pollutants in it come from could save hundreds of millions of dollars. In pursuit of the answers, experts are using computer models to create what may be the most sophisticated analysis ever of how a harbor system actually works.   B1    Parkway Disrupted by Blaze  One home was destroyed and nine others were damaged, hundreds of residents were evacuated, and a 24-mile stretch of the Garden State Parkway was closed yesterday by a windblown forest fire that engulfed more than 1,000 acres of tinder-dry pinelands several miles inland from the Central New Jersey shore.   B1    Relocating the Mentally Ill  When state officials moved in March to close Seaport Manor in Brooklyn, long one of New York's most notoriously troubled adult homes for the mentally ill, they pledged to do all they could to protect the safety and well-being of its nearly 300 residents. But the home's discharge records and interviews with officials show that the state, in coordination with Seaport's management, has merely been relocating many of the profoundly ill residents to other adult homes that have their own histories of neglect.   B1    Ground Zero on the Cusp  Many of them said they would be back to leave flowers and written messages for their dead relatives, and to mark a lifetime of anniversaries ahead. Still, a memorial service for the families of more than 2,800 victims of the World Trade Center attack held enough finality for organizers to call it the Ground Zero Closing Ceremony.

But the transition has been far from smooth, and it now appears that it will be shorter than promised. People inside Merrill say the relationship between David H.

I stepped into the head of a pool, which was deep. I went down far enough for the water to come up to my chest and even to come over the tops of my waders. I turned around and faced upstream and immediately saw my predicament: I could not go back the way I had come because the weight of the current was too much, and yet downstream the water was even deeper, over my head.
