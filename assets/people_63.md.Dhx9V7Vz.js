In a major development last week, 11 large companies and their insurers decided to test a system in which employees and their doctors are asked about specific results of medical treatments.    Employees treated for lower back pain, for example, would be asked whether they could climb stairs, bend over to tie their shoes and do other things reflecting their health status.    The test will seek to determine whether the system is \\"a useful and valid way of demonstrating accountability,\\" said Bill Goss, the health-care programs manager at the General Electric Company. Large employers spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on employee health care. \\"But we are not really sure whether we are getting value from it,\\" said Mr. Goss, who is chairman of the group conducting the test.    The companies and insurers taking part include American Telephone and Telegraph, with the Travelers","excerpt":"Ameritech, with Illinois Blue Cross and Blue Shield; Digital Equipment, with Fallon Community Health Plan, Harvard Community Health Plan and Matthew Thornton Health Plan, three New England health maintenance organizations; General Electric's aerospace unit, with U.S. Healthcare, and General Motors, with Blue Cross of Missouri and St. Louis and Kaiser Permanente in Cleveland.   Other participants are Hercules, with the Intermountain group in Salt Lake City; Honeywell, with  Doctors and patients will use questionnaires developed by medical authorities for Dr. Paul Ellwood, president of Interstudy, a nonprofit research group based in Excelsior, Minn. The sponsor is the American Managed Care Association, whose members include 150 large companies that use health maintenance organizations and networks of doctors and hospitals.    During 12 months, the 11 companies will all ask employees about the same two or three medical conditions. Lower back pain, angina (heart attack) and asthma are the most likely subjects, said John Doyle, the project's coordinator at Interstudy.    Dr. Ellwood said Interstudy questionnaires were already being used in a similar project at half a dozen group medical practices across the country, including the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. The American Group Practices Association is the sponsor.    In yet another project, General Motors, Ford Motor, Chrysler and the United Automobile Workers union agreed this month to work on quality-ofcare measures with nine health maintenance organizations in southeastern Michigan. The H.M.O.'s will be required to meet certain standards and their members will be asked whether the H.M.O.'s provided satisfactory care.    The American Medical Association and several medical specialty professional groups are taking a different tack. They are developing guidelines for medical procedures and treatments that are based on a consensus of views of experienced doctors and from medical journals.    The A.M.A. says the guidelines will be parameters, leaving ample room for variations in particular cases. \\"The specialty societies' fear is that if they don't develop guidelines, the Government will do it for them,\\" said Dr. David M. Eddy, a professor of health policy and management at Duke University.    Indeed, Congress has already ordered Federal studies of both guidelines and medical results that the Government calls patient outcome research. \\"At least we ought to know where we are getting the biggest bang for the buck without causing harm to patients,\\" said Ira Raskin, an economist who is acting director of the Center for Medical Effectiveness at the Federal Public Health Service.

By JAN MORRIS   A perpetually busy pedestrian thoroughfare, starting as the Lista di Spagna but changing its name repeatedly along the way, leads rumbustiously from the railway station at Venice into the heart of the city. Six or seven hundred yards along it, I suppose, beyond the great canal called Canareggio, a smaller street takes off to the north: and if you follow this one, the Rio Terra Farsetti, after a few minutes you will find yourself standing upon a wooden bridge before the looming back-quarters of a monumental row of buildings.   They are six, seven or eight stories high, very high for Venice, and they look from this side distinctly forbidding, for not only are their serried windows small and dark, but a canal runs all the way round them like a moat. Lines of washing flap cheerfully enough, it is true; there are canaries in cages and geraniums in pots, somebody's basket hangs on its long string waiting for the morning mail and here and there you may glimpse the movements of housewives in high kitchens. The tunnel-like entrance in front of you, though, looks grimly unwelcoming, and the sockets in its stonework, evidently meant for iron bars, make it look disturbingly like a prison gate.

This sweeping compilation of 79 essays, many of which appeared in The Village Voice, celebrates an American art form, profiling luminaries from W. C. Handy to Cassandra Wilson and tracing the music back to its roots in 19th-century minstrelsy. ''Giddins is our best jazz critic'' and '' 'Visions of Jazz' is the finest unconventional history of jazz ever written -- a brilliant, indispensable book,'' Alfred Appel Jr. wrote in the Book Review in 1998. ''Giddins has 'big ears,' as jazz musicians used to say, and his jazz vision, his tireless listening habits, are in the public interest.'' Giddins's first collection of essays, Riding on a Blue Note: Jazz and American Pop (Da Capo, $16), explores both popular music and jazz","excerpt":"among its highlights is an incisive account of the musical and criminal career of the gifted trumpeter Red Rodney. In 1981 our reviewer, Robert Palmer, said Giddins is ''particularly scrupulous in his evenhanded appreciation of jazz from every period.''    Jackstraws: Poems   By Charles Simic. Harvest/Harcourt, $13.    Several poems in this collection explore the moral and eschatological dimensions of insect life. ''Simic is a master at interrogating ordinary occurrences with piercing yet slightly tongue-in-cheek observations,'' Albert Mobilio wrote here in 1999. He ''snatches profundities from the air around him, like so many flies to some wanton boy.'' Most of the verse in All of Us: The Collected Poems, by Raymond Carver (Vintage Contemporaries, $14), was written in the 1980's, during the final decade of Carver's life, and reflects his desire to blur the lines between poetry and prose. The poems capture ''much of the same pared narrative power that distinguishes'' his short fiction, David Yezzi said here in 1998. ''Their willed artlessness and unflinching emotions commend them to us.'' Girls on the Run: A Poem, by John Ashbery (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $12), is an elusive, splintered tale based on a band of cartoonish characters from a surreal illustrated novel by the artist Henry Darger (1892-1972). The result is ''a tank of literary laughing gas that exhilarates and confounds in roughly equal measure,'' David Kirby wrote in these pages last year. In On the Bus With Rosa Parks: Poems, by Rita Dove (Norton, $11), a former poet laureate of the United States reflects on Rosa Parks and other civil rights figures, and on public history versus private. ''The poet's eye and voice, trained for the nearly invisible detail, rescue characters from obscurity by illuminating their ordinariness,'' Matthew Flamm said here in 1999.    The Corruption of American Politics:  What Went Wrong and Why   By Elizabeth Drew. Overlook, $15.95.    A respected chronicler of the Washington scene examines the campaign finance system and shows how both parties have a vested interest in torpedoing efforts at reform. ''She nimbly brings to life the machinations on Capitol Hill and the White House with fresh perspective, behind-the-scenes detail and convincing analysis,'' Richard L. Berke wrote here last year.    A Golfer's Life  By Arnold Palmer with James Dodson. Ballantine, $15.    This autobiography by one of golf's most endearing figures is as unpretentious as its subject and ''yields interesting and unexpected stories about Palmer's mistakes, disappointments and personal failings,'' Michael Bamberger said here in 1999. ''Palmer has led a rich and singular life and has captured it in a wonderful book.''    Drink: A Social History of America  By Andrew Barr. Carroll & Graf, $16.    A British journalist offers both an impressionistic history and a polemic intended to shake up American attitudes and assumptions about alcohol use. ''His book is at once well intentioned and scornful, earnest and breezy, consequential and frivolous,'' Patricia Nelson Limerick wrote in these pages last year.    Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire  By Jason Goodwin. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $15.    A travel writer and journalist traces the rise and fall of a former imperial power, from its modest beginnings in the 14th century to its stagnation and collapse in the 20th century. Last year our reviewer, Fouad Ajami, called this ''a work of dazzling beauty'' that blends ''historical scholarship and curiosity about distant places with luminous writing.''    By the Shore  By Galaxy Craze. Grove, $12.    The 12-year-old narrator of this first novel describes growing up with her single mother in a small English village, and what happens when her playboy father reappears at an awkward moment in their lives. ''Craze's skill is in seeing so clearly through a vulnerable child's eyes,'' Carol Peace Robins wrote in the Book Review in 1999. ''Snippets of dialogue tell a lifetime of stories.''   Scott Veale   New & Noteworthy Paperbacks"},{"year":"1995","title":"THE star-studded memorial parks of Los Angeles are the mortuary equivalent of the footprints at Mann's Chinese Theater or Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame.

So when their building went up for sale a year ago, it was perhaps not surprising that the residents chose to band together and embarked on a real-estate transaction that itself may be unique to Manhattan both in its size and complexity.   The 60 tenant families - among them actors, lawyers, teachers, even a private detective - are cosponsoring the conversion of their 75-year-old building to cooperative ownership, a move that Jane Rosenberg, an assistant state attorney general in the Real Estate Financing Bureau, called ''extremely rare, if not unique.''   The conversion process of 33 Fifth Avenue was triggered in 1969, when Congress enacted legislation requiring many foundations to divest themselves of major portions of their business holdings. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, one of the nation's largest philanthropies with assets of well over $1 billion, thus had to dispose of its real-estate holdings","excerpt":"among its substantial properties in New York was 33 Fifth Avenue.

In spite of the interesting cast and Hugo Rodríguez's deft sense of timing, the movie is little more than yet another numbing, dumbing exercise in warmed-over cool. &#151; A. O.
