Born in Brooklyn on May 2, 1923, Allen Goldring graduated from James Madison High School in Brooklyn and received his Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Cornell University. His World War II service entailed three years in France and Germany. He often told the dramatic story of how, in 1945, his unit was being sent to Japan to engage in battle when VJ Day was declared and the transport ship turned around mid-ocean to return to the U.S. On arriving home, he expanded a local car dealership owned by his father, Joseph G. Goldring, and founded the international company, Overseas Military Sales Group, whose principal business is the marketing and distribution of automobiles, trucks, motorcycles and related financial products to U.S. and British military consumer markets on military installations and U.S. Naval vessels. The company also sells to government agencies, multi-national corporations and international executives assigned overseas. Headquartered in Woodbury, NY, the Goldring International Group's operations encompass the U.S. and 27 countries in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East and has 400 employees worldwide. A dedicated philanthropist, Mr. Goldring directed the Joseph G. Goldring Charitable Foundation, which supports programs in medical research as well as cultural and educational activities. Through the foundation, he endowed a chair at the Skirball Center of New York University Medical Center, as well as a Fellowship at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, among other activities. He and his wife, Lola, supported the Goldring Arts Journalism Program at Syracuse University, to teach journalists to write about the arts and culture. An enthusiastic admirer and collector of contemporary art, he was a founding trustee of The New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York City. His other passions were opera and golf. He was a life member of the board of trustees of New York University Medical School, and a supporter of arts and charitable organizations such as the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Ballet, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, United Jewish Appeal and The New Museum. He served on numerous boards, including the Metropolitan Presidents Organization, Restaurant Associates, Inc., the World Presidents' Organization Foundation, and the Berlin Airlift Memorial Foundation. A notable business leader, he served as the president of World Presidents' Association (WPO) in 1987 and received an Honorary Doctor of Law Degree from The American College of Switzerland in 1986. Mr. Goldring was a member of the University Club of New York, Confrerie de la Chaine des Rotisseurs, North Shore Country Club, the Admirals Club and the Bear's Club of Jupiter, Florida.

He was also a board member of the American Newspaper Publishers Association (ANPA), its Bureau of Advertising (Chairman 1964 - 6), Ohio Newspaper Publishers Association and the Associated Press. Mr. Strong's education included earning three academic degrees by the time he was 22: two from the University of British Columbia (B. Com, 1933","excerpt":"AB Honors, 1934) and one from Northwestern University (MBA, 1935). He added a fourth, a law degree, from the University of Toledo, in 1940. He held teaching positions at Northwestern, University of California (Berkeley) and University of Toledo. It was during his graduate fellowship at Northwestern, while both teaching in the School of Commerce and earning an MBA, that he met and married Jean McDougall, one of his students. They were married in 1935 and headed west to an academic post at UC Berkeley, where Mr. Strong taught accounting and took courses toward a Ph.D. in Economics. The following year (1936) he was awarded a scholarship from Harvard to complete his Ph.D. Traveling across country to Harvard, the couple stopped in Toledo, OH and were persuaded by the president of the University of Toledo to stay for a year and assume a professorship. They never did make it to Harvard, making Toledo their home for the next 16 years. During World War II, he was the Director of Finance for the Mediterranean Theatre for the American Red Cross, stationed in Algiers and Naples, Italy from 1943 to 1945. Mr. Strong entered the newspaper business in 1945 when Paul Block, Jr., publisher of the Toledo Blade, recruited him, ultimately becoming Treasurer and Business Manager. In 1952 he was recruited to become General Manager of Brush-Moore Newspapers, a chain of seven Ohio and Maryland newspapers based in Canton, OH, ultimately becoming President, Publisher and Director. He led Brush-Moore for the next 15 years. In 1967, he negotiated the sale of Brush-Moore to Roy Thomas, Lord Thomson of Fleet, and Publisher of the London Times. Mr. Strong remained with Thomson Newspapers as Chairman of the Board for ten years until he retired in 1977. At the time of his retirement, Thomson Newspapers owned approximately 115 newspapers. Two days into retirement, Combined Communications asked him to return to work as Publisher of the Oakland Tribune, which he did and where he remained after Gannett Newspapers acquired Combined, until 1980, when he retired again. His wife of 65 years, the former Jean McDougall, preceded him in death in 2001. He is survived by his son, George G.

By Percival Everett. (Permanent Press, $19.95.) In his fourth novel, Percival Everett places us in a postnuclear world, regimented into discomfort and numb with an official pessimism that has mandated the sterilization of women. Alice Achitophel, 260 pounds of self-hating civil servant, has ignored the order. Now, following a rape, she thinks she's pregnant. Alice flees to a rebel camp, surrealistically gives birth to a slenderer version of herself, returns to the city in this new incarnation with an enigmatic loner named Kevin, once more believes herself pregnant, smuggles drugs from a hospital and surrealistically loses her child to rebel thieves. This fable is by courtesy -- or discourtesy -- science fiction, although it deals roughly with the logic of its situation. The only food people eat is uncontaminated cheese and fruit","excerpt":"abandoned libraries are crowded with the homeless, yet humble workers own houses with guest rooms. Stark and sometimes powerful prose serves primarily to set forth a pattern of symbols -- repeated washings indicating guilt, repeated ineffectual births indicating the End of the Line. Mr. Everett, caught up in a personal but by no means unusual disaffection, sends readers to the reference library with his quotation-heavy chapter heads (check your Dryden for Achitophel) without giving us any particular reason to hope for enlightenment, passion or pleasure. \\"Zulus\\" \\n\\nmight \\n\\nhave been science fiction, cautionary fiction or moral fiction -- or that most admirable combination of the three.

Major trading partners: exports: 28% U.S., 16% Japan, 6% Taiwan; imports: 23% Japan, 20% U.S. The Philippines were anciently settled by various Malayan peoples in several waves of migration from Southeast Asia. Tribal societies coexisted with petty principalities that had trade links to China, the East Indies, and countries in the Indian Ocean. The Philippines were visited by Magellan (who was killed there) in 1521, and Spanish conquest of the islands began in 1564. The Spanish colonial capital at Manila was founded in 1571 and became a key transit point for trade between Mexico and the Far East. Under Spanish rule a majority of Filipinos became Christian except in the southwestern islands, which remained Muslim. The Spanish period was marked by a torpid colonial administration and a rise in the power and wealth of the Catholic church. In the late 19th century, a nationalist movement led by José Rizal gained a wide following. In 1896 an armed uprising began, led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The 1898 victory of Adm. George Dewey at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish-American War led Spain to cede the Philippines to the U.S. in return for a payment of $20 million. Expecting immediate independence with U.S. support, Aguinaldo declared the islands a republic. When this was not recognized by the U.S., Aguinaldo led a new war for independence, which was bloodily suppressed by American troops in a six-year campaign, 1899–1905. American policy in the Philippines combined military control with a desire to encourage home rule leading to independence. In 1935 the Commonwealth of the Philippines was established, with Manuel Quezon as its first president, beginning what was conceived of as a 10-year period of controlled autonomy leading to full independence on July 4, 1946. In November 1941, Quezon was reelected to the presidency. On Dec. 8, 1941, Japan attacked Manila and destroyed the American bases there. American and Filipino troops, after weeks of fierce fighting, evacuated the islands in March 1942. The battle to recapture the Philippines began with the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944 and was completed by July 1945. In April 1946, Manuel Roxas was elected president of the Commonwealth. Independence came as scheduled on July 4 of that year, with the United States retaining military bases by treaty and establishing a special economic relationship with the Philippines. The leftist Hukbalahap Rebellion, originally a partisan campaign against the Japanese, caused severe difficulties for the new nation until it was finally defeated in military campaigns led by Ramon Magsaysay who was elected to the presidency in November 1953. The early years of independence were marked by some economic development, but also great economic inequality. Most land was held by huge estates, and the economy depended primarily on plantation crops (sugar, copra), mining, and timber. Villagers fleeing the rural subsistence economy poured into the cities, leading to huge slums and a climate of urban poverty and violence. In 1966 Ferdinand Marcos was elected president on a reform platform. Overwhelmed in the early 1970's by demonstrations, a new leftist guerrilla movement, and a separatist rebellion by Islamic Moros in Mindinao, Marcos declared martial law on Sept. 21, 1972. On Jan. 17, 1973, Marcos promulgated a new constitution giving unprecedented power to the presidency. His wife, Imelda, began to wield considerable influence, and the climate of unrest, poverty, and corruption worsened throughout the 1970's. Martial law was lifted, however, on Jan. 17, 1981, and Marcos was reelected to a new six-year term as president. The airport assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino on his return to the Philippines on Aug. 21, 1983, led to a new phase in opposition to Marcos's rule. In a bitterly contested presidential election in February 1986, Marcos was officially declared the winner over Aquino's widow, Corazon. Mrs. Aquino also declared herself the winner, and her supporters took to the streets in massive anti-Marcos demonstrations. Deserted by key supporters in the military, church, and middle class, Marcos fled the country on Feb. 25, 1986. Mrs. Aquino took office pledging land reform, a new constitution, and a commission to recover the wealth Marcos had plundered. Under Pres. Aquino the Philippines remained unsettled. Her former ally, Vice Pres. Salvadore Laurel, formed an opposition party. Military and political measures aimed at putting down the Communist insurrection yielded mixed results. The economy of the Philippines continued to be dependent on U.S. and international assistance, and sentiment against the continued presence of U.S. military bases (Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base, and four smaller installations) was strong. Ironically, an eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 caused massive devastations in central Luzon and destroyed Clark Air Base. In September, the national legislature voted not to renew the leases on American military bases; the United States moved to close Subic Bay Naval Base. Aquino declined to run for re-election in 1992. Fidel Ramos won the presidency in a field of strong contenders, including Imelda Marcos. Lifted by a coalition that gave him a controlling majority in both houses of Congress after the 1994 legislative elections, Ramos made “national reconciliation” his highest domestic priority. In 1994 he proclaimed a cease-fire and amnesty for various insurgencies. The Philippines' robust economic growth was slowed but not crippled by the Asian economic crisis of 1997–98. After some hesitation, Pres. Ramos decided not to seek re-election in 1998; in a crowded field of candidates, Joseph Estrada, a popular actor, won the presidential election of May 11, 1998, but the ruling LAKAS party elected the vice-president and took control of the lower house. In 1998 the long-running dispute with China over the Spratly Islands heated up, the Philippine Navy sequestering Chinese fishing boats. A series of hostage crises with Muslim rebels on Mindanao punctuated the year 2000 but became overshadowed by serious bribery charges against Pres. Estrada. As the House of Representatives moved toward impeachment, gigantic demonstrations for and against Estrada brought reminders of the fall of Pres. Marcos. When the Senate in Jan. 2001 suspended the president's trial, the protests expanded to a general strike; and when the heads of the armed forces joined the protests, Estrada's days were through. Vice-president Gloria Macagapal Arroyo was sworn in as Estrada resigned. By May the anti-Estrada coalition controlled the Congress and Estrada was under arrest.
