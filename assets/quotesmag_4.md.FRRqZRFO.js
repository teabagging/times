Yesterday was the end of a two- week statement period when banks must settle their reserve positions with the Federal Reserve.

Meanwhile, there was moderate demand for the Treasury's auction of $6 billion in four-year notes yesterday, similar to the mild response Tuesday to an auction of 20-year bonds. The notes, due Sept. 30, 1988, sold at an average yield of 11.42 percent, very close to what had been expected.

I am a school psychologist working for the New York City Board of Education. I have been receiving Social Security checks since my 70th birthday on Oct. 15, 1993. Although F.I.C.A. taxes of $2,600 have been deducted from my salary this year, my Social Security checks have remained the same. There is no reflection of my continued contributions. Why is that? \\nWALLACE SCHNEIDER, Manhattan \\nA. As long as you continue working, you must pay Social Security tax on your earnings. Whether the additional tax increases the amount of your benefits, though, depends on how much you earn. Benefits are based on your best working years, or the years in which you earned the most money, according to Dale Detlefs, a Social Security consultant in Louisville, Ky.\\n\\n For those born after 1928, the 35 best years are used to calculate benefits. Because you were born in 1923, the best 29 years are considered. If your current earnings are not among those years, they will not affect your benefit. Furthermore, once a taxpayer reaches the maximum benefit, additional taxes will not lead to a bigger check. \\"In that case it's just like so many other taxes we pay where we see no direct benefit,\\" Mr. Detlefs said. \\nTelephone Bonds \\nQ. Among the daily \\"key rates\\" listed in The New York Times business section is a puzzling listing for telephone bonds. I've checked with a number of business librarians and none can explain it. What is it? \\nJOHN MARSH, Woodside, Queens \\nA. Telephone bonds is a generic name for a listing that was once the AT&T","excerpt":"bond, a bellwether for the bond market. The listing, compiled by Salomon Brothers, currently quotes the price of the U SWest 7 1/2 percent coupon bond due in 2023.\\n\\n Investors are interested in the telephone sector because these bonds are less volatile than industrial-sector bonds, said Stevyn E. Schutzman, a bond research analyst at Salomon. \\"These companies have very strong credit fundamentals,\\" Mr. Schutzman said. \\"They do not have a need to raise capital in the debt markets. And the telephone sector is noncyclical.\\"\\nBonds and Bond Funds \\nQ. What is the major difference between corporate bonds and corporate bond funds? When prices drop, is the principal of one more secure than the other? \\nTHELMA BLUMBERG, Baltimore \\nA. Both investments lose value when interest rates rise. But if you buy an individual bond, you can hold it until maturity and get your principal back. A bond fund contains a number of individual issues chosen by the fund manager, who may buy and sell continually. Because the bond fund has no maturity, there is no guarantee that you will get your principal back.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1.2 percent, or 68.58, to 5,838.52, eclipsing its May 22 record of 5,778.    The bond market also rallied, as long-term interest rates fell below 7 percent, to 6.95. Behind the surge was economic news showing inflation in check, lessening fears that the Fed will push up interest rates. $(Page 1.$)    The dollar rose against the mark and yen, reaching two-month highs. It followed stocks and bonds upward, despite the weaker-than-expected economic data. Foreigners bought dollars in order to buy American securities. In New York the dollar edged up to 1.5134 marks. $(34.$)    Oil Futures Prices Tumble   Crude oil futures plunged with the contract for October delivery down 49 cents, to $24.51 a barrel, after tensions with Iraq eased. $(34.$)    F.A.A. Faulted on Airport Security   A newly issued Government report says that in inspecting airport security, F.A.A. agents sometimes overstated how well airports performed and made efforts to help airlines do well on the inspections. $(1.$)    In the Tobacco Economy: Alarm   Tobacco is the main cash crop in Kentucky and much of the South, and now a whiff of national politics has tobacco farmers in full alarm. Many local Democratic politicians find themselves opposing President Clinton. $(1.$)    Compuserve Backpedals on Profit   Compuserve retracted a prediction of profits made by one of its executives. Steven Stanbrook, Compuserve's president of international operations, had said in Munich that based on the strength of European operations, ''for the year as a whole we will be making a strong profit.'' $(32.$)    Japanese Economy Shrinks 0.7%   Japan's economy contracted seven-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter. It was the first time economic output had declined since 1994's final quarter, but the Government said the nation's recovery was continuing. $(32.$)    A Mistrial in California Bankruptcy   A mistrial was declared in the first criminal trial related to the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., that of the former budget director, Ronald S. Rubino. $(44.$)    Brazilian Air Travelers Restive   As Brazil moves slowly toward privatization of state-run industries and dismantling of regulation, a travelers' campaign opposing the high cost of domestic air fares appears to have struck a chord at an opportune moment. $(32.$)    Nestle Profits Advance 20%   Nestle, the world's largest food and beverage company, said its net profit rose 20 percent, to 1.35 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion) in the first half of 1996, but its stock price fell 10 Swiss francs to 1,413, as investors focused on stagnant trading results. Heineken, the Dutch brewer, reported a 6.1 percent profit rise. $(32.$)    The Hottest Shop in Moscow   Moscow's hottest store is suitably named Arrears. Bargain hunters rush to buy the latest booty seized by the Moscow tax police -- boxes of down coats going for the equivalent of $17, and even a 10-year-old Hungarian-made bus for $19,000. $(4.$)    Mexican Publisher Arrested   The owner of one of Mexico's biggest newspapers, El Universal, was arrested on charges of criminal tax fraud and evasion.

That year Emory Cook, the American audio engineer, flew to Rio with a portable tape recorder and spent an evening pointing a microphone at him","excerpt":"Bonfá played his own music, American standards (''Night and Day'' and ''Tenderly'') and deft improvisations tilting toward classical-guitar technique. Bonfá, who died in 2001, was a bit older than the rest of the bossa nova gang, and, when given the opportunity to show it, more of a traditional virtuoso. But unlike João Gilberto, he has been known more as a songwriter than as an individual performer. This album, ''Solo in Rio 1959'' (Smithsonian Folkways), a reissue of Cook's recordings, corrects the imbalance. It's well recorded, honest and casual, with a lot of personality; he tries things he's clearly still tinkering with, including some through-composed pieces that are far from samba and more like classical tone poems.    Bastro      The overlooked power trio of late-80's underground rock was Bastro, from Louisville, Ky.; a new CD reissue on Drag City combines its two albums ''Sing the Troubled Beast'' and ''Diablo Guapo.'' It included the guitarist and singer David Grubbs (whose subsequent hard left turn into quieter, more cerebral and experimental work with Gastr del Sol is foreshadowed by a few tracks here), the bassist Clark Johnson and the drummer John McEntire, who later joined Tortoise. The disc is a good ending place for short, loud, grinding, passionate, brainy rock 'n' roll -- the kind of thing that had a hot, confessional, political charge when the Minutemen introduced it earlier in the decade, but by this point had become music about music.    Ravi Coltrane      One of the things to admire about the saxophonist Ravi Coltrane is the slow, methodical way he built his career. His first album, ''Moving Pictures,'' from 1998, was a tentative beginning, almost a record of sketches; he wasn't fully rounded yet, and given the opportunity to record (as any saxophone-playing son of John Coltrane would be), he didn't fake secondhand flash. A few so-so albums went by after that, and now at the age of 39, on the new ''In Flux'' (Savoy Jazz), he's come into his own. The album enlists different approaches: mysterious and moving ballads (''Away,'' ''For Zoe''); free improvisation within tight rhythmic structures (''Leaving Avignon'' and ''Scram Vamp''); a rubato ballad (''Dear Alice''); the rhythmic complexities of the new Latin jazz, negotiated with the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Drew Gress and drummer E. J. Strickland; layered time signatures; a few short free-jazz scrimmages. Mr. Coltrane avoids tired song structures and doesn't want to bore you. He's fascinated on one hand by miniatures and on the other by the idea of longer songs that sound like collective improvisation from start to finish. It's a record that you can point to and say: This is what jazz sounds like now in New York.    Dave Holland      After making records for 32 years for the ECM label, the bassist and bandleader Dave Holland, one of the more important figures in jazz, has formed his own label, Dare2. Its first release is ''Overtime,'' by Mr. Holland's big band -- a relatively new 12-piece outgrowth of his more widely known quintet. With the frighteningly well calibrated quintet, you know what you're going to get: careful compositions based on ostinatos, and odd metered funk and counterpoint. The big band does more. Loud and fairly traditional, its arrangements for booming horn sections mix influences from postwar Count Basie and Duke Ellington, as well as Thad Jones; it's also music of a different temperature and mood, accommodating more slow tempos, along with some old-fashioned, take-your-time, knock-it-out-of-the-park solos. (There are a few of those here, especially by the saxophonists Chris Potter and Mark Gross, and the vibraphonist Steve Nelson.) There's a sameness in the arrangements from track to track, and nothing's particularly devastating; like a high-end station wagon, the band projects strength and solidity.    John Hollenbeck      Like Mr. Holland, the drummer John Hollenbeck is a rhythm-section player who leads a quintet and recently grew his music to big-band size. It's pretty clear he's the leader: rhythm provides the guiding wisdom of each piece. ''A Blessing'' (Omnitone), the first recording of his Large Ensemble, suggests one logical extension of Mr. Holland's group, toward multiple personalities. Mr. Hollenbeck is clearly interested in a huge area of contemporary music, from minimalism to African music to art song to funk to free and straight-ahead jazz. (He never sounds like he's mocking any one style, or overreaching: he figures out a way to make everything his own.) It's a real ensemble record, without many solos in the traditional jazz sense; the musicians play in tight, arranged sections, but also go to the other extreme, teasing out weird timbres and textures. Some tracks are dead serious, like ''The Music of Life,'' with a Sufi-philosophy text sung by Theo Bleckmann over clouds of slowly changing chords. Others have a dry and brainy sense of humor, and try ideas that might look dreadful on paper, like putting a shard of ''April in Paris's'' melody over a reggae rhythm and ambient horn arrangements. In some wily way, it turns out not to be dreadful at all.   How Rio Sounded in '59, How New York Sounds Right Now"},{"year":"1933","title":"Canfield, Dorothy","excerpt":"Bonfire BONFIRE.

That question, at the heart of a long, heated public debate over the East Side's soaring residential towers, may soon be answered, Last week, the City Planning Commission heard testimony on two proposed zoning amendments that would effectively reduce the height of new towers and encourage tower-on-a-base, wedding-cake buildings as opposed to tall, thin towers. The commissioners are schedule to vote on the amendments on Dec. 20. If approved, the measures will go before City Council. PROPOSAL 1    Co-sponsored by the Manhattan Borough President and Community Board 8, this amendment rezones 143 blocks between 59th and 96th Streets and between Eas End and Third Avenues to conform with the zoning pattern in the rest of the city. It would reduce the permissible depth of lots along avenues from 125 feet to 100 feet. Because the size of a building's bases determines the height allowed, this would have the effect of reducing the building's height. PROPOSAL 2    Sponsored by the Department of City Planning, this amendment would apply citywide to buildings on avenues but have particular impact on high-density residential areas like the Upper East Side. The amendment calls for wedding-cake towers on bulky residential buildins with high street walls. This would effectively reduce the maximum height of towers from 50 to 32 floors. The amendment would eliminate the extra-floor bonuses given to developers for incorporating plazas","excerpt":"bonuses for including moderate-cost housing in designs would remain.

One is to work in front of TV cameras. Mike Leonard, author of ''The Ride of Our Lives: Roadside Lessons of an American Family'' (Ballantine), has that part nailed: he's been appearing pretty often on NBC's ''Today'' show. Another is to employ, on your dust jacket, a blurb from another prominent TV personality and best-selling author. (Leonard scored Tom Brokaw, who blurbles: ''Mike Leonard is a national treasure.'') But there are subliminal methods, too. If the cover of ''The Ride of Our Lives'' looks familiar, that's because Leonard's jacket is weirdly similar to the cover of Mitch Albom's mega-selling 1997 book ''Tuesdays With Morrie'' (Doubleday). It's all there -- the same Time magazine-like red border, a similar typeface and mix of upper- and lowercase words.

Carol Schneider, director of publicity for the Random House Publishing Group, of which Ballantine is a division, told me: ''It's a time-honored tradition for publishers to be inspired by elements of other best-selling jackets, though no one could mistake one for the other, as the Leonard has both a photograph and an illustration on the cover art.''
