Security guards intervened, and Mr. Kantor missed his target. Mr. Kantor, who was filmed throughout the incident by his own crew, has been banned from many galleries around the world because he has committed several of his ''blood performances.'' Since the Flick exhibition opened in September, critics have accused Mr. Flick -- whose grandfather was a Nazi arms industrialist who employed as many as 50,000 slave laborers -- of trying to whitewash his family's history.
