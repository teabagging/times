If this account occasionally is uneven, static or overdramatic, attribute it to a justifiable hatred of everything German. Suffice it to say that this reportedly first picturization of what happened to slave labor in the Third Reich when the Nazi tide was at its highest is a story fervently told and one which should be well remembered.As director and co-scenarist, Mikhail Romm has slanted his theme from the viewpoint of a girl sold to drudgery in a German grocer's home, a Soviet scientist who is the janitor in that household and the members of the grocer's family. As greedy, bestial and murderous a crew as has come to the screen in some time, the characterizations of these latter, intense as they may be, generally are not overdrawn. They are a lot who consider it natural to cruelly starve, beat to death and imprison rebellious servants. The pompous tradesman deems it fitting to hide his money, stolen from a Jew, from the rest of his covetous brood. In discovering the scientist's value, he considers it sporting to attempt to sell this chattel's services for a profit. And the grocer's son, on leave from the front, finds it natural and necessary to terrorize the entire menage for the ill-gotten loot.Elena Kuzmina, as the heroine who finally resorts to murder to escape her inhuman captivity, gives a passionate and understated delineation of her role.

Furthermore, the Russian directors have managed to put a deal of romance into the rather technical subject of how best to turn out the huge steam-electric turbines so much in demand over there.The main theme of the picture is devoted to efforts of Pavel (D. Abrikosof), Lazaref (M. Kozlovsky), engineers","excerpt":"Vasya (Boris Tenin), secretary of the Communist shop group, and Tchutkotchkin (G. Gudkin), a student engineer, to improve the functioning of the plant, despite stealthy acts of sabotage by Engineer Skortsof (B. Poslavsky), a hold-over from the old régime who occupies an important position. The student finally discovers the failure of some of the key machinery to work properly to be due to Engineer Skortsof's \\"carlessness\\" in allowing a mistake of three-hundreths of a millimeter to be made in changing the British blue-prints from inches to the metric system.But before the satisfactory ending is reached and the big, new turbine proves its worth, there are all sorts of complications, involving the wrongful branding with \\"shame\\" of Babtchenko (Vladimir Gardin), an old-time skilled mechanic, who has a fondness for books and is scornful of the new shop ways. The acting of Gardin and his general appearance remind one of Emil Jannings. His excellent work is one of the high spots of the picture. The other members of the cast also are first-class performers.

It's the stuff of vaudeville, a format that has never been far away from Laurie Anderson's style of performance art. Her large, recurring themes are invariably overshadowed by the oblique brilliance of individual bits.    Ms. Anderson is performing the world premiere of her latest multimedia work, \\"Stories From the Nerve Bible,\\" at the Annenberg Center through Saturday. It is presented by the American Music Theater Festival. The stage has a row of bright television monitors and large video screens, sliding (like Japanese shoji screens) and suspended. Ms. Anderson sometimes sits at a keyboard, sometimes strolls with an electric violin, sometimes gestures with airport-signal flashlights or plays a synthesizer, trademarked Bodysynth, that is triggered by arm and hand movements. Guy Klucevsek on accordion and keyboard, Greg Cohen on bass and Cyro Baptista on percussion supplement Ms. Anderson's music and voice, creating understated funk vamps and soothing or foreboding sustained chords.

As Bubka stood outside a hotel on Seventh Avenue, wearing a warmup suit and holding a fiberglass pole, he spoke to Vladimir Gheskin, a correspondent for the newspaper Sovetsky Sport. Bubka seemed to wonder why an American photographer would want him to pose on the sidewalk, in the cold, not far from Madison Square Garden, with all these strangers standing around. Bubka spoke quickly. He laughed at his observation.

In her 21st volume of fiction, Dame Muriel, now in her 80's, gleefully pulls her characters' strings in a farce in which two men who claim to be Lord Lucan (the real-life aristocrat who disappeared in 1974 after killing his children's nanny during a botched attempt to kill his wife) try to blackmail a German psychoanalyst who has a bogus identity and criminal past of her own. The result is a typically witty romp filled with ''eye-and-mind-catching gesticulations,'' Richard Eder said here last year.    SINGING BOY, by Dennis McFarland. (Picador USA, $14.) This novel begins with the random shooting of a Boston scientist. But what propels the mystery is not the murder, which goes unsolved, but the struggle of the victim's wife, son and friend to find ways to go on living. ''The conflicts here, and their resolution, take place within the heart and mind,'' Allegra Goodman wrote here in 2001. ''The reader can't help sharing their proud, exclusionary grief.''    A PRIMATE'S MEMOIR, by Robert M. Sapolsky. (Touchstone/ Simon & Schuster, $14.) A field biologist tells of his adventures with a baboon troop in Kenya that he studied for more than 20 years. His impassioned, irreverent and occasionally cranky account ''achieves an almost Homeric emotional range'' as it ''steeps us in baboon-land variants of heroism, lamentation, vengeance and loneliness,'' Rob Nixon said here last year.    HOSTAGE TO FORTUNE: The Letters of Joseph P. Kennedy. Edited by Amanda Smith. (Penguin, $20.) In this huge compilation edited by one of Kennedy's granddaughters, the financier, ambassador and patriarch comes off as a man of fierce will and outsize sentiment (both good and bad). His letters, rounded out with other family correspondence, reveal ''a poignant, misunderstood dragon, more complicated, perhaps, than any of his children except Bobby, that other improbable combination of rapacity and romance,'' Thomas Mallon said here in 2000. Reagan, in His Own Hand: The Writings of Ronald Reagan That Reveal His Revolutionary Vision for America, edited by Kiron K. Skinner, Annelise Anderson and Martin Anderson (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $16), is mostly a collection of radio commentaries Reagan wrote and delivered between 1976 and 1980 that suggest that the Gipper was more policy wonk than culture warrior. Last year our reviewer, David Brooks, said the documents ''blow apart the notion that Reagan was a flighty actor who floated through the presidency on the basis of charm and communication skills.''

PERFECT RECALL: New Stories, by Ann Beattie. (Scribner, $12.) More elegiac than her earlier work, these 11 stories once again explore the kinship structures among the narcissistic white upper middle classes on the East Coast, particularly the mostly sexless alliances that offer a safe haven until death intervenes. ''So vivid and beguiling is Beattie's writing that it isn't until you look again that you realize how rarely she reaches for metaphors or other figures of speech, and how little she needs to,'' Jennifer Schuessler said in these pages in 2001.    CARACOL BEACH, by Eliseo Alberto. (Vintage International, $13.) In a junkyard deep in Florida, a guilt-ridden Cuban Army veteran waits for someone, anyone, to kill him. His quest turns farcical, however, as he pulls a wild assortment of ne'er-do-wells and wandering souls into his bleak orbit. Comparing this Cuban novel to the work of Gabriel Garc&#237;a M&#225;rquez, James Polk wrote in 2000 that ''magic realism is in flower, but beneath its extravagant exaggerations lie serious observations about human nature.''    THE DEVIL AND SONNY LISTON, by Nick Tosches. (Back Bay/ Little, Brown, $14.95.) Charles Liston, the grandson of a freed slave, emerged from a rough Arkansas childhood and a prison term in Missouri to become a feared heavyweight contender in the shadowy world of professional boxing.

This teenage-wasteland melodrama plays off its sly title by starting with the bungled, bloody aftermath of a crime gone wrong and then shifts into flashback mode: the same opening that has benefited hundreds of movies since ''Asphalt Jungle'' first made it popular. Mr. Lin, creator of this shrewdly tense piece of storytelling, recognizes that sometimes it's good for a filmmaker to stir up trouble. He does so by taking the group most often orphaned into stereotypical behavior by teenage films, Asian-Americans.

(Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.) Blending biology, archaeology, computer science and other disciplines, the author examines the phenomenon of swarm logic: the ability of ants -- or brain cells, city neighborhoods or even software programs -- to display greater intelligence collectively than individually, without any centralized control. Last year our reviewer, David Pogue, admired the book's ''wit, clarity and enthusiasm.''    LILI, by Abigail De Witt. (Norton, $13.95.) This tale's terrain is its heroine's interior landscape, a vast region encompassing much of the 20th century and defined less by world events than by her family, her marriage, her loving commitment to her disabled son and her spiritual war with God. The result is an ''engrossing and ambitious first novel,'' Valerie Martin wrote here in 2001.    EMBERS, by Sandor Marai. (Vintage International, $12.) Originally published in Budapest in 1942, this novel revolves around an adulterous affair in turn-of-the-century Austria-Hungary. Forty years later, the deceived husband, a former Austrian general, confronts his rival and former friend on the general's Hungarian estate, where the men pass the night chewing over memories, politics and the wearying effects of time on the human heart. In 2001 in these pages, Richard Eder admired the story's ''powerful undercurrent of suspense and its elegantly wrought armature of moral and metaphysical argument.''    THE RACE TO THE WHITE CONTINENT, by Alan Gurney. (Norton, $15.95.) The author tells of the expeditions in the 1830's and 40's that paved the way for the race to the South Pole: at the heart of the story are three competing voyages, one French, one English and the third American. Gurney ''is obviously at home with sailing ships'' and ''with those who manned them,'' Roland Huntford said here in 2000. ''Consequently, there is a refreshing gusto to this book.'' Huntford's biography of the Norwegian polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930), Nansen: The Explorer as Hero (Abacus, $16.95), has also been reissued. Among other things, the dashing Nansen helped popularize skiing as a sport, won a Nobel Peace Prize and achieved worldwide fame with his grueling three-year attempt to reach the North Pole. ''Huntford is masterly at weaving Nansen's life into his times,'' Annette Kobak wrote here in 1999.    KISSING IN MANHATTAN, by David Schickler. (Delta, $12.95.) Whether Wall Street traders, lovelorn hipsters or scarred young men from the hinterlands, the characters in these 11 linked stories tend to be die-hard romantic strivers searching for redemption from their problems in the dark whirl of a mythical, surreal New York ruled by the spirit of improbable endings. ''Schickler is a writer of brisk and quirky sentences'' and his ''voice is witty and gently spiky,'' Jennifer Schuessler wrote in these pages in 2001.    REPUBLIC.COM, by Cass Sunstein. (Princeton University, $12.95.) A law professor explores the impact of the Internet on American democracy, raising troubling questions about such threats as the dissemination of extremist material and insulation from differing points of view. ''Sunstein writes in a clear and inviting style,'' Stephen Labaton said here last year. ''He performs an important service in casting a skeptical light on a medium more often seen as a utopian technology than as a potentially corrosive force.''    DANCE OF KNIVES, by Donna McMahon. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $15.95.) In 22nd-century Vancouver, where an unspecified ''Collapse'' has left a brutal, lawless society in its wake, a na&#239","excerpt":"ve young woman befriends a robotlike giant whose free will has been stolen by a blackmailer.

Scott Veale   New & Noteworthy Paperbacks"},{"year":"2001","title":"Wang Xiaoshuai's ''So Close to Paradise,'' which opens today at the Screening Room, has some of the gamy, brutal melancholy of a classic Hollywood tough-guy B picture. Set on the margins of Shanghai's underworld, it follows Dong Zi and Gao Ping, two migrants from the countryside, through a perpetual twilight of sleazy nightclubs and petty thuggery. Dong Zi (Shi Yu), honest and na&#239","excerpt":"ve, ekes out a menial living on the docks, carrying heavy loads on a pole balanced on his shoulders. Gao Ping (Guo Tao), as his friend's slightly awed voice-over narration describes him, has adopted the ways of the city, smoking filtered cigarettes, dressing in dark suits and eschewing hard work in favor of small-time criminality.    Seeking vengeance on a fellow hoodlum who has ripped him off,  Ping drags Zi on a fatal adventure (the voice-over informs us of its bad end early on) that leads them first to a Vietnamese cabaret singer named Ruan Hong (Wang Tong) and then into further trouble with the gangster boss to whom she belongs. The timid Zi is immediately smitten with  Hong, but he goes along with Ping's plan to kidnap her and watches through a crack in the door, in impotent horror (or fascination; his face is hard to read), as his friend rapes her. He must then endure the further humiliation of tagging along with  Ping and the singer, who settle, after that violent courtship, into what looks like ordinary couplehood.   The Living Is Sleazy Under the Shanghai Moon"},{"year":"2002","title":"(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)    ROSCOE, by William Kennedy. (Viking, $24.95.) In the seventh novel of Kennedy's splendid Albany cycle, Roscoe Conway, heir to the city's three-time mayor, operator and fixer and finder of needful cash, runs out of zeal for the political game and falls in love, of all comic possibilities, with another man's wife.

Dee, a courageous novelist of ideas, takes on morals, lost love and the art of selling in this story about a beautiful (and passive) woman and two advertising executives who differ about the power of the viewer over the thing viewed.    CHRIST: A Crisis in the Life of God, by Jack Miles. (Knopf, $26.95.) The author of ''God: A Biography'' (1995) continues his examination of God strictly as a literary character -- a complex, contradictory one who learns about himself from his interactions with humans; in becoming one himself, God accepts and expiates his guilt for his errors since the Creation.    MOVIE LOVE IN THE FIFTIES, by James Harvey. (Knopf, $35.) Towering westerns and pert musicals are largely absent from this quirky celebration: how, Harvey asks, can they compare with James Mason as a megalomaniac cortisone addict or Deanna Durbin, incredibly, as a noir femme fatale -- small beacons of subversion in an age of staggering conformity.    BE MY KNIFE, by David Grossman. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) A brilliant concoction by an outstanding Israeli novelist whose hero, a 33-year-old married man, persuades a woman to undertake a brutally honest love affair to be carried on, in a political and physical vacuum, entirely by correspondence.    SELECTED ESSAYS, by John Berger. (Pantheon, $35.) Edited by Geoff Dyer, who published a life of Berger in 1986, this fat volume spans roughly 50 years of the output of the distinguished British art critic and novelist who won the Booker Prize in 1972.    THE LETTERS OF KINGSLEY AMIS, edited by Zachary Leader. (Talk Miramax/Hyperion, $40.) More than a thousand delicious pages of uncharitable observations by the author of ''Lucky Jim'' and many other fine surly novels, a womanizer who did not like women and a writer who could barely tolerate books; his letters to Philip Larkin are particularly funny, despite the absence of Larkin's letters to him.

LATITUDES OF MELT, by Joan Clark. (Soho, $24.) A slowly mesmerizing novel in which a baby found on a cake of ice off Newfoundland grows up to construct an existence seemingly untroubled by the nonexistence of a past, leaving it up to her children and grandchildren to figure out who she might be.

These include American missile defense plans, the next round of NATO expansion and Russia's problematic sales of nuclear material and technology to Iran.

It is none of your frothy Gallic pieces, nor is it—except by psychoanalytic standards—the penetrating satire on war that the advance press-agentry might have had you believe. It is altogether too gentle for that, too close to the heart and mind of children to be bitter in its consideration of anything. War is a game and love is a game and losing one's trouser buttons to the enemy is a tragedy. \\"Generals Without Buttons\\" is as naive as all that and a delight to a light-minded theatregoer.Once upon a time—so runs the prologue—there were two neighboring French villages, Longverne and Velrans. Longverne was famous for its cabbages","excerpt":"Velrans for its grapes. And on this day long, long ago, a cloud appeared in the sky. Promptly the Longvernes went to their priest to pray for rain for their cabbages. And promptly he marshaled them into a pilgrimage to go to the shrine midway between the two villages. But the Velrans, seeing the same cloud and fearful for their grapes, had gone to their priest to pray for no rain. And he, good man, marshaled his flock into a pilgrimage and set out for the same shrine. So they prayed—the Velrans for sun, the Longvernes for rain—and they exchanged words, then blows, as they met at the shrine. Whether it rained or shined no one recalls, but for generations the two villages remained enemies.It is with the modern, the very young modern, generation that \\"Generals Without Buttons\\" is concerned. Just as the Mayor of Longverne and the blond school teacher of Velrans have reached a pleasant truce, the youngsters of the two villages go to war. They fight in a quarry and take the buttons from their prisoners of war. To be stoned or struck with a stick or captured by the enemy is disgraceful enough, but to lose one's buttons! To return home supporting one's pants, clutching one's shirt, sure of a beating by a thrifty father who places one's buttons on a material plane! Grief, no less than trousers, insupportable!The saga of the buttons, of the Longverne Mayor and the Velrans schoolmarn, of the famous peace conference in the village square has been charmingly, cleverly, deftly told. The youngsters have played it with the complete naturalness of children engrossed in a game of make-believe and the grown-ups, like Jean Murat, Claude May and Saturnin Fabre, with just sufficient exaggeration to lend a touch of adult humor. Jacques Daroy has directed it sensitively, with shrewd respect for the ironclad, adult-posted world children live in, and with a camera-wise relish of the pastoral. War is not supposed to be idyllic and generals should not be quaint, but \\"Generals Without Buttons\\" is both.At the Broadway Cine RomaIt is too bad that such a finely photographed and smoothly directed picture as \\"Lancieri di Savoia,\\" the new Italian importation at the Broadway Ciné Roma, should have been robbed of much of its interest by having been made in the form of a lengthy \\"flash-back.\\" Right at the beginning when the blond Elisa Cegani, in the role of a still charming middle-aged matron, learns that the horse ridden by an officer in a racing event is named after one owned by the officer's instructor, fallen in the World War, the audience is prepared for a frustrated romance.Consequently, while the incidents of the affair between the handsome cavalryman (Amedeo Nazzari) and the lovely girl who sacrificed their love to save the fortunes of her ill father (Luigi Carnii) are well done and the acting is excellent, the element of suspense is lacking. Spectacular scenes of hard riding alternate with more tender happenings in just about the proper proportion. \\"Savoy Lancers\\" is an ICI production directed by Goffredo Alessandrini.

Even by the sardine-can standards of New York, yesterday was a disaster.   Dr. Irwin Weisbuch knew it was not going to be easy the moment that he and his 11-year-old daughter, Tammy, walked out of their apartment building on East End Avenue at 83d Street. It was 7:10 A.M. He had a 7:30 meeting at Beth Israel Medical Center, at First Avenue and 16th Street. She was due at school shortly after 8.    It was slow going. It took them 45 minutes to go four blocks on the 86th Street bus. Dr. Weisbuch gave up on his meeting.   On subway lines that were running, it was standing-room only. On lines that were not, confused-looking commuters emerged from the underground, clutching transfer slips for already overloaded buses that limped up and down avenues, shock absorbers straining under all that weight.    \\"Let them in,\\" commanded the driver of an M16 bus on Lexington Avenue. \\"The more, the merrier.\\"   The people on the bus, crushed together shoulder to shoulder and wet from the afternoon rain, had had it. \\"Tell the bus driver not to let anyone else in,\\" one passenger pleaded. \\"We can't fit.\\"    It was a day when people who think they have it easy, who boast about their speedy trips at cocktail parties, found things nasty, brutish and anything but short. At noon on Central Park West and on Columbus Avenue, where taxis usually whiz along, converging in twos or threes when someone tries to hail just one, the traffic was going nowhere fast.   \\"It's bumper-to-bumper everywhere,\\" said Thanh Thach, a taxi driver whose cab was creeping along Fifth Avenue at noon. \\"East Side, West Side, it's like we're having rush hour all day.\\" Crowds and Confusion     The tie-ups and the anguish soon spread beyond the flooded, buckled pavement of East 42d Street. Subway platforms in Queens and Brooklyn jammed as commuters were forced to find new ways into Manhattan.  Moshe Politis, a system sales representative at the Computer Factory, on Lexington Avenue at 47th Street, ended up on an A train from Queens and had to switch to an F train at West Fourth Street. He rode that one to Rockefeller Center and then walked across town.    \\"I was only 45 minutes late,\\" he said.    Confusion complicated other odysseys. \\"The problem with the subway service is that they don't give you much information,\\" said Berry O'Donovan, a 36-year-old property manager from Park Slope who was trying to get to her East 86th Street office, \\"and it's not understandable when they do.\\"   Things were not much better in the suburbs: the backups backed up far beyond where they usually do. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive clogged up, clogging roads that feed into it. That left drivers on the Cross Westchester Expressway, who pride themselves on knowing how to beat any backup, with no choice: there were delays on the Major Deegan Expressway and the Saw Mill River Parkway.   And what about going the other way, from Manhattan to Queens? \\"I don't know how I'm going to get there -- I may have to walk,\\" said Al Tripoli, an engineering manager who arrived at Grand Central on a train from Brewster, N.Y., and was headed across the East River to Long Island City, Queens. Innocence Proclaimed     In the Times Square subway station, people lined up at pay phones. They spoke many languages -- English, Spanish, Korean and Hindi -- but everything they said was a variation on a single theme: this time they really did have a good excuse. One woman with a briefcase explained her situation in English: \\"I'm going to be late. There's been a water main break.\\"   Transit Authority workers in orange vests directed the larger-than-usual crowds. \\"It's not us this time,\\" the station manager, Kevin Berry, told one woman. And then, shouting into his bullhorn, he offered a bit of advice as straightforward as any that Ann Landers or Dear Abby ever proffered. \\"Bus service is horrendous at this time,\\" he said. \\"It is best to walk across town.\\"   The Water Main Break","excerpt":"Venice-on-42d-Street Maroons New Yorkers"},{"year":"1935","title":"3rd biennial motion-picture exhibit awards","excerpt":"Venice, Italy MUSSOLINI CUP GOES TO NEW GARBO FILM; ' Anna Karenina' Receives High Award in Venice at Third Motion-Picture Exhibit."},{"year":"1991","title":"The last six world championships have been in Sao Paulo, Brazil","excerpt":"Venice; Nottingham, England; Perth, Australia; Geneva, and . . .

(Vintage Contemporaries, $14.95.) A writer whose fiction is grounded in the aches and dreams of bumptious, blue-collar New Englanders sets his new novel (which won a Pulitzer Prize) in a dying mill town in Maine, where a large cast of finely observed characters -- chief among them the likable, if unfulfilled, manager of the Empire Grill -- play out their lives with as much grace and gusto as they can muster. ''Russo is brave enough to conceive a large ambition but too smart to overreach,'' A. O. Scott wrote in the Book Review last year. ''His humane sympathy for weakness and self-deception . . . does not rule out stern satiric judgment.''    KIKI'S PARIS: Artists and Lovers 1900-1930, by Billy Kl&#252","excerpt":"ver and Julie Martin. (Abrams, $19.95.) Model, painter, cabaret singer and world-class bon vivant, Kiki was so popular she was elected ''Queen of Montparnasse.'' She also knew everyone in a neighborhood famously crowded with creative spirits, from Picasso to Cocteau. The many photographs in this homage accompany ''a carefully researched text that is always amusingly written and bristling with information,'' Edmund White wrote here in 1989.    COME UP AND SEE ME SOMETIME, by Erika Krouse. (Washington Square/Pocket, $12.) This first story collection is filled with smart, sassy 30-ish women who insist on owning up to their own pain as they grapple mightily with the problem of finding and hanging on to love. Krouse's ''arsenal is stocked with . . . potent, original stuff,'' Maria Russo said in the Book Review in 2001.    A WHALE HUNT: How a Native American Village Did What No One Thought It Could, by Robert Sullivan. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $13.) The author recounts his two-year vigil with the Makah Indians of Neah Bay, Wash., as they sought to restore their tribal tradition of hunting the gray whale, a pursuit hampered by animal-rights protesters, internal squabbling and, above all, a lack of know-how (the tribe stopped whaling a generation before). ''Sullivan has a very Ishmael-like talent for being both funny and generous,'' Nathaniel Philbrick wrote here in 2000. In The Eternal Frontier: An Ecological History of North America and Its Peoples, by Tim Flannery (Grove, $16), a Tocqueville of American biogeography bravely tackles the continent's last 65 million years, surveying an evolutionary work in progress in which waves of invaders adapt and become extinct, clearing the way for new immigrant species. Last year in these pages, David Quammen said, ''Flannery synthesizes a vast range of scientific studies and a decent selection of historical and cultural writings, leavening those with his own forceful ideas.''    IN CUBA I WAS A GERMAN SHEPHERD, by Ana Men&#233;ndez. (Grove, $12.) A daughter of Cuban exiles explores the interlocking obsessions of two sets of Cubans -- those at home and those in Florida -- whose clashing voices have aged into futility and craziness after 40 years of separation. In 2001 our reviewer, Richard Eder, called these ''achingly wise stories about the Cuba in Miami and, in ghostly pentimento, the Miami in Cuba.''    NEXT: The Future Just Happened, by Michael Lewis. (Norton, $13.95.) These linked essays argue that the Internet -- far from being a disappointment -- has succeeded in rearranging the fundamental social order through a populist electronic uprising led by young prodigies who are subverting their elders' clunky old regime. ''In a tone both ominous and bemused . . . Lewis suggests that they'll soon be running everything,'' Walter Kirn said here last year. He ''writes best when he's personalizing . . . economic change.''    O'NEILL: Life With Monte Cristo, by Arthur and Barbara Gelb. (Applause, $24.95.) In the first book of a three-volume rewriting of their 1962 ''O'Neill,'' the authors (Arthur Gelb is a former theater critic and was later managing editor of The Times) re-examine the great American playwright in light of new archival material and insights into his life and work. ''Their research and dedication are impressive,'' Margot Peters wrote in these pages in 2000.    1831: YEAR OF ECLIPSE, by Louis P. Masur. (Hill & Wang, $14.) A solar eclipse was just one of many notable events in America that year: slavery, abolitionism, Indian rights and religious revivalism were among the major moral and political issues at center stage. This novel ''gives insight into the character of the United States and . . . entertains with the stories it provides,'' David Traxel said here last year.

And in \\"Murder in the Music Hall,\\" which came to the Gotham on Saturday, her base of operations has not changed too much. Again it is an ice revue, in which she pirouettes gracefully as the star. But the producers have provided a fillip in the form of a passably intriguing mystery in which Miss Ralston also exercises her talents as an actress. This combination of whodunit and skating pyrotechnics will not revolutionize either art form, but the picture generates enough interest to make it a reasonably diverting entertainment.If Miss Ralston is a fairly breathless ballerina at the denouement, she can hardly be blamed. For, as a prime suspect in the murder of a prime heel—an ex-convict and theatrical impresorio who is not averse to blackmailing lady ex-friends—Miss Ralston has to divide her time chasing clues and returning on stage for strenuous turns. Only through the help of her sweetheart, the show's conductor, and an assist from the police, does the harried skater manage to prove her innocence. Suffice it to say there are a half dozen other suspects and the culprit isn't the obvious one.Expert in the ice extravaganza sequences, Miss Ralston, however, is not called upon to do much toward easing her predicament, a chore which is earnestly handled by William Marshall as her boy friend. William Gargan makes a convincing police inspector, while Ann Rutherford, Jerome Cowan, Nancy Kelly, Helen Walker and Julie Bishop are among the suspected. The title notwithstanding, it should be noted that the killing doesn't take place in the Music Hall. The dastard was done to death in an apartment next door.

The best use for attics, they may be excused for contending, is to provide a refuge for old clothes and bats. They can bring history to bear to refute the Romantic thesis that great art is only produced under the stress of bohemian poverty, mental anguish or political persecution. For every tubercular Chopin coughing his life away over a nocturne, there has been a Strauss or an Elgar, comfortably situated and idolized by his countrymen. Or a Verdi, who early in life suffered just enough to give his biographers something to chew over, but who was, before the age of 30, a national hero.   And yet the Garret Theory, like most popular delusions, contains a seed of truth, the fact of creative life being that most talented people do their best work under pressure and sometimes almost crippling constraints. Some artists, if not all, seem to thrive on the need to surmount obstacles. By the time Verdi came to write ''I Due Foscari,'' his sixth opera, which Eve Queler's Opera Orchestra of New York will present in a concert version on Tuesday evening at Carnegie Hall, some of his earlier problems had disappeared.
