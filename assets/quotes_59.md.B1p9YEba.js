But three international economists - Lawrence J. Krause of the Brookings Institution, Bela A. Belassa, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University and a consultant to the World Bank, and Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics - took time out from the sessions to discuss the world economy and its prospects for growth.   Q: Most economists - and now the Reagan Administration - are predicting a slow, weak recovery in the United States next year. With that assumption, how much growth can be expected for the international economy in 1983? KRAUSE: These new numbers from the Administration reflect a cut in growth during 1982. If you think in terms of fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter growth, rather than calendar year over calendar year, the outlook for 1983 has not been reduced very much at all. Under the former measurement, I think the economy should expand between 4 and 5 percent next year in real terms. In that case, you should have the beginnings of a recovery in the world economy.

(Knopf, $24.) The sixth novel in 40 years of careful, lapidary production by this elegant Irish writer concerns the passage of a year in an unnamed Irish village, a couple who have returned to it, and a community for which the biggest event of the year is the arrival of a telephone pole.    WHAT KIND OF NATION: Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, and the Epic Struggle to Create a United States, by James F. Simon. (Simon & Schuster, $27.50.) A professor of law examines the angry dialogue of several decades between Jefferson, who thought the 13 colonies made 13 sovereignties, and Marshall, who thought the Constitution made them one.    A MULTITUDE OF SINS: Stories, by Richard Ford. (Knopf, $25.) Quite a few wrongs are done in these elegantly worded stories, although what prevails is generally adultery, often depicted at the end of an affair or later, when it's too late to throw those dice again.    OAXACA JOURNAL, by Oliver Sacks. (National Geographic, $20.) An organized excursion for fern lovers became a discovery of Mexico for the endlessly curious Dr. Sacks, first shocked by the third-world poverty of rural Mexico, then entirely absorbed in the visit to another time provided by its pre-Hispanic remains.    THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE, by Ann Beattie. (Scribner, $24.) Does less of minimalism mean more of something else? Beattie's novel explores at length, in a prose that owes much to the language of therapy, a fraught relationship between a 40-ish woman whose husband is dead and her brother, a flagrant womanizer.    ATONEMENT, by Ian McEwan. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $26.)

AT SWIM, TWO BOYS, by Jamie O'Neill. (Scribner, $28.)

(Random House, $22.95.) A confidently anarchic first novel whose title refers to the international distress channel for mariners in trouble; most of it happens at sea, off Alaska's North Slope, and the chief victim of the happenings is a likable unfortunate who has spent a decade working the Arctic and becomes the only survivor of a disaster wrought by a captain who screams at his crew, ''Do Things!''    SOLDIERS: Fighting Men's Lives, 1901-2001, by Philip Ziegler. (Knopf, $26.) Ziegler, well known as a biographer of royalty and celebrities, concentrates here on the ashes of empire by talking to residents of London's Royal Hospital Chelsea, veterans of Britain's wars from Flanders to Cyprus and Aden, men who had little to lose in life and little to gain but whose fidelity never came into question.

In small towns in this part of the country, however, people still feel deeply their obligations to the past. And there aren't many of us who don't willingly remember and honor our dead, whether they died in the service of their country or simply succumbed to illness or age.   I was about to describe the holiday as somber, and in an obvious way it is that. But there's also a certain joy in the sense of continuity and fulfillment that comes with pausing to pay tribute to those who have gone before.   Today, I'm thinking about someone in particular: Gary Gordon, a young man who left this town, his hometown (and mine), to join the Army in 1978, when he was 18 years old.   Lincoln is a pulp-and-paper mill town and shopping center of 5,500 tucked among the fir forests and spring-fed lakes of northern Penobscot County. Gary attended the local high school and was a running back on the football team. He wasn't in the starting line-up, but he always gave his best. He liked to draw and doodle and sometimes his teachers thought he did too much of it in class. His mother, Betty, says his favorite subjects for drawing were military -- guns and tanks and things. That could have been a hint of his later career path, but in the years of the Vietnam War a lot of young boys were attracted to the military.   Still, Gary's interest may have surpassed that of the others. He liked to read and regularly rode his bike to the library to borrow books. A while back a friend of Gary's was seeking some information on the Medal of Honor at the library and found what he was looking for in an Army Information Digest pamphlet published in 1962 on the shelf. Checking the card in the back, he discovered that the last person to take out the publication had been Gary Gordon, on Oct. 1, 1971.    On Oct. 3, 1993, 22 years and two days after he borrowed that pamphlet, Master Sgt. Gary Gordon of the Army's elite Delta Force died along with 17 other Americans in a battle in Mogadishu, Somalia. (Seventy-five soldiers were wounded.)    He and his partner, Sgt. 1st Class Randy Shughart of Newville, Pa., were lowered down from a helicopter in the midst of the battle and killed as they sought to rescue wounded members of the crew of another helicopter that had been shot down. The pilot of the downed craft, Chief Warrant Officer Michael Durant, survived (he was captured, but later released), and said not long after, \\"Without a doubt, I owe my life to these two men and their bravery.\\"    In a ceremony at the White House on May 23d last year, President Clinton awarded Medals of Honor posthumously to Gary and Randy \\"for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty.\\" The medals were given to their widows, Carmen Gordon and Stephanie Shughart. Gary's children, Ian and Brittany, were there, as were his parents, Duane and Betty Gordon. These are the only Medals of Honor that have been awarded for acts of valor committed in the years since the Vietnam War.   Perhaps this is a good place to say something about the history of the medal. Established July 1862 by an act of Congress, it is our nation's highest military honor as well as the first to be given. Until that time, Americans hadn't thought much about rewarding their military forces, but as tales of heroism began to emerge from the battles of the Civil War, politicians in Washington responded to a growing public sentiment for recognition of outstanding heroism.   The first six were presented on March 25, 1863, to survivors of a Union Army raiding party that had slipped into Georgia in civilian clothes in April 1862 to sabotage the Confederate rail link between Atlanta and Chattanooga.   All told, there are slightly more than 3,400 Medals of Honor on the books for the 132-odd years of its history, about half of those given for heroism during the Civil War, a time when brutal hand-to-hand fighting was the rule rather than the exception. World War I produced 96 winners","excerpt":"World War II, 432; Korea, 131, and Vietnam, 238.    In one corner of Duane and Betty Gordon's living room, there's a small display of a flag that flew over the Army compound in Mogadishu, one of Gary's green berets and other mementos of his military career. A drawing he did a few months before he was sent to Somalia, in August 1993, has a prominent place on the wall. The precise detailing of men in battle with a helicopter hovering in the background lowering reinforcement troops on ropes sometimes makes his parents wonder whether Gary had a premonition of his fate.   \\"It would have been really weird if there'd only been two of them,\\" said his mother, noting that the drawing shows three men coming down the ropes, not two as when Gary and Randy made the drop.    On Oct. 14, 1993, Gary Gordon was brought home to Lincoln. \\"I was overwhelmed when I came into town that night and saw the crowd downtown in the rain and the cold,\\" Betty said. Her eyes moist, she added, \\"You raise a child and then suddenly you're sitting in a car alone . . .\\"    She said some people ask why Gary wasn't buried at Arlington National Cemetery, outside of Washington. She tells them: \\"He didn't want to be. He wanted to be brought home here.\\"   So he came home to lie in the cemetery on West Broadway, not far from the center of town and the library where he borrowed books on battles and the Medal of Honor.

They proposed basing charges for each article on the energy units used in its production and distribution.   In those precomputer days, it was quite a feat to imagine a gigantic clearinghouse allocating credit to each citizen and balancing the resulting supply and demand. To its credit, Technocracy began by acknowledging that modern industrial society was inherently wasteful, that most of our manufactured goods could easily be redesigned to last a lifetime, that the whole industrial system could be allowed to slow down or operate only intermittently -- and that our work hours and living patterns could be adjusted accordingly, as long as everybody received the basic citizen allocation of credit as a fundamental insurance of survival in a technological society.
