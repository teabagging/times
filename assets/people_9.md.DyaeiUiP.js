But MAN RAY 1890-1976 (Ludion/ Abrams, $65) does just that, offering a trove of  little-known photographs, as well as reproductions of a few paintings and works  in other media. The book, which includes more than 300 pictures, covers Ray's earliest days in New York, his astonishing career in Paris in the 1920's and 30's, and his years in Hollywood, where he lived in the 40's. Bursting with photographs that are by turns sensuous, sardonic and surprising, \\"Man Ray 1890-1976\\" offers ample testimony to the artist's inventiveness and to the diversity of his output. His links to Surrealism are apparent in shadowy \\"photograms,\\" made without a lens, and in dreamy solarized nudes. But Ray also operated a commercial studio, and examples of his fashion photos are included, as are portraits of leading artists and intellectuals, among them Marcel Duchamp, Gertrude Stein and Jean Cocteau. The strength of this remarkable book is its thoroughness. But only the barest information is offered for any of the pictures","excerpt":"also missing are essays that might have clarified how these images fit into Ray's overall output.

In the Angel release at hand, the packaging triumphs over artistic logic: while Turandot's imperious ''In questa reggia'' is delivered impressively, indeed, and the soprano gives a believable account of Tosca's and Manon Lescaut's dramatic predicaments, no impresario in his right mind would cast this commanding lady in ''La Boheme,'' ''Le Villi'' or ''Gianni Schicchi.''

Although the story as it comes to the screen is a little creaky in spots, and the lines put into the mouths of the characters are often more amusing than natural, through Mr. Wallace's imaginative guidance of the scenes it makes quite a satisfactory entertainment.Here Clara Bow undertakes a serious rôle, but the player who captures the histrionic honors is Regis Toomey. He impersonates Chick Hawes, an ex-convict, who, on being released from prison, vows to reform. Miss Bow plays Chick's faithful wife, Molly, who is just as eager as her husband to have him steer clear of his former criminal associates and find honest employment. The difficulties he encounters, what with having to admit that he is a jail-bird and being watched by sleuths, are aptly told.The police pounce upon Chick when a necklace is stolen from the home of the District Attorney. They do not suspect him of the crime, but one of the detectives believes that information can be forced from him that may at least lead to the recovery of the string of diamonds. In this the zealous detective is not far wrong, and when the necklace is discovered in an expected place the commissioner has little compunction in permitting Chick to go free.Mr. Wallace gives a graphic and an original conception of Chick leaving prison. First the prisoner is perceived in his cell, nervously watching a clock through the bars. Then he is led away to a long counter, where he receives clothes, $10 and a ticket back to the city where he lived before his incarceration.There are quite a number of other cleverly directed sequences, notably the glimpses of detectives interrogating a woebegone drug addict","excerpt":"also some of the scenes in which the police commissioner holds forth and where he receives the stolen necklace.In her performance Miss Bow reveals her limitations. She is the least effective member of the cast. Mr. Toomey delivers a thoroughly understanding and sympathetic portrayal. Wynne Gibson makes the most of the part of an unfortunate girl. Juliette Compton is moderately humorous as a shady character known as Piccadilly Bessie.

Billboards are flashing, highway lights are pulsing, and tall buildings seem to have been converted into giant television screens. China's showcase city appears to be showing off, decorating itself as though it's Asia's Las Vegas. This is China's financial capital, its fashion center and, clearly, its coolest metropolis. Be prepared for a city on steroids, and one banking on long-term hyper-growth. In a country increasingly populated by grimy, characterless cities, Shanghai is also far and away China's most attractive city, particularly after nightfall.    Friday    6 p.m.  1. A Walk Along the Bund  The most spectacular view of Shanghai can be seen at night from the Bund, a historic waterfront area that sits on the west bank of the Huangpu River. Hulking stone structures built in the 1920's and 30's by the colonial powers that once dominated this city have been handsomely renovated and transformed into upscale bars, restaurants and retailers. Walk along the promenade and look out across the river toward the city's booming financial district, Pudong, which is packed with futuristic skyscrapers and flashy neon-lit billboards. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, now known as HSBC, once had headquarters on the Bund, and the building's foyer at No. 12 is gorgeously restored with murals and carvings. Also notable are the Custom House and the Art Deco Peace Hotel (20 Nanjing Road East, 86-21-6321-6888). A building known as Three on the Bund, however, is in perhaps the city's most impressive location (86-21-6321-7733). The interior was elegantly redesigned by Michael Graves. On the ground level is Giorgio Armani. On the third floor is the hip Shanghai Gallery of Art, where one gets a nice view of the building's splendid atrium.    8 p.m.  2. Restaurant on Restaurant  A nice way to start off a trip to Shanghai is with dinner at Laris, one of the superb restaurants at Three on the Bund. It is decorated in soothing colors and cool marble. From your table, you can often catch a glimpse of the river and Pudong's space-age skyline. The chef, David Laris, who is Australian Greek, likes fresh ingredients and international flavors. He serves up some wonderful raw oysters","excerpt":"also try the sumptuous beef tenderloin with pancetta and the foie gras terrine with porcini mushrooms (dinner for two, about 790 yuan, or $100 at 8 yuan to $1). On the building's fifth floor is the Whampoa Club, whose Art Deco entrance -- with a touch of Asia -- is exquisite. Another winner is Jean Georges Shanghai, the restaurant on the fourth floor named for its creator, the internationally recognized chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. You can also visit the top floor and New Heights, which has outdoor seating for dinner or simply drinks.    10:30 p.m.  3. A Bar Named Glamour  You don't have to leave the Bund to find a great bar and lounge. Across the street from Three on the Bund is No. 5 on the Bund (entrance on Guangdong Road), home to M on the Bund, a popular dining spot for foreign visitors and China's nouveau riche. On the sixth floor, the Glamour Bar is one of the best places in the city to relax with a drink. The lounge (86-21-6350-9988) has a 1930's style decoration with a hip, contemporary twist. Try the litchi martini for about 67 yuan. Just down the road, at No. 18 on the Bund, is Bar Rouge, another stylish fashion bar, often crowded with China's equivalent of the Hollywood set.    Saturday    10 a.m.  4. Pudong: The New China  Back in the 1980's, Pudong was a muddy tract of farmland across the river from downtown Shanghai. But in 1990, it was declared a special economic zone. Today, it's the fastest-growing part of the city and home to a dazzling new financial district. It also has the city's most compelling and quirky skyline. Two of China's tallest structures are here: the Oriental Pearl Tower -- a tacky concrete pole that at more than 1,500 feet is the tallest TV tower in Asia -- and the nearly 1,380-foot Jin Mao Tower, the tallest building in China and one of the most attractive skyscrapers in the world. Both are fine places for a scenic view of Shanghai's awesome real estate building boom. Going up on the southeast side of the Jin Mao is Shanghai World Financial Center, which is to be completed in 2007 and expected to challenge Taipei 101 in Taiwan as the world's tallest building. The new addition to the Shangri-La Hotel (33 Fucheng Road, 86-21-6882-8888) is also a good place for a scenic view, and it has a great bar and an elegant restaurant, Jade on 36, which features a deconstructed rice bowl entryway and glass snuff bottle decorations. The view after dark is just as spectacular. Also of note in Pudong is the new $125 million Shanghai Oriental Art Center, which was designed by the French architect Paul Andreu and, they say, is meant to look like a butterfly orchid blooming in a large glass bowl. The center has three large performance spaces, with the lobby, chamber music hall, concert hall, exhibition hall and opera hall each occupying one of the ''petals'' of the orchid.    Noon  5. The French Concession  Much of the charm of Shanghai lies in the old streets and neighborhoods that make up the former French Concession. While many of Shanghai's old lane houses are being bulldozed to make way for often ugly high-rise apartment complexes, this district is filled with leafy lanes and Western-style mansions and gardens. Huaihai Road and Maoming Road are populated with trendy boutiques. Several good options for lunch include Shintori, an excellent Japanese restaurant (803 Julu Road by Fumin Road, 86-21-5404-5252) set in a warehouse with a shimmering gray interior, with lunch at 350 yuan weekdays, 70 prix fixe on weekends, or Yin, which offers Chinese on the first floor and Japanese upstairs (Old Jin Jiang Hotel Gate No. 2, No. 59 Maoming Road South, 86-21-5466-5070); 100 yuan for lunch. It's part of the Old Jin Jiang Hotel, the Art Deco-style complex where Richard M. Nixon and Zhou Enlai signed the Shanghai Communiqué in 1972, an important document that helped re-establish diplomatic relations between the two countries.    4 p.m.  6. An Art of Its Own  Chinese contemporary art is booming. And while much of it is centered in Beijing, Shanghai is developing its own art district, fashioning cool studios and galleries out of old warehouses and textile mills. The new arts district here is called M50, or 50 Moganshan Road. The area is not easy to find, but M50 is definitely worth a visit. Some of Shanghai's best-known artists work here, like Zhou Tiehai, Gu Wenda, Wang Xingwei and Ding Yi. The most interesting gallery shows are held at ShanghART's H-Space (50 Moganshan Road, Building 18, 86-21-6359-3923). Also, take a peek inside Art Scene Warehouse (Building 4, 2/F, 86-21-6277-4940), which has a large and varied collection of works on display. Or simply wander into the open art studios. Shanghai's two art museums, both in the People's Square area, are also worth a visit: the Shanghai Art Museum (which this year is host of the Shanghai Biennale to Nov. 5) at 325 Nanjing Road West (86-21-6327-2829) and the Museum of Contemporary Art at 231 Nanjing Road West (86-21-6327-1282), tucked away in a park and housed in a remodeled greenhouse.    8 p.m.  7. New From Old  Xintiandi means ''new heaven and earth'' and it's the name of one of Shanghai's most popular tourist spots. Pronounced shin-tyahn-DEE, this area of upscale restaurants, bars and boutiques is prized because it's part Disney, part old Shanghai and part Faneuil Hall in Boston. An American architectural firm, Wood & Zapata, splendidly renovated and recreated a district of old Shikumen lane houses -- the early-20th-century stone-and-brick edifices that were a blend of European and Chinese architectural styles. While the area is small, and often crowded, it's now a must-see in Shanghai. Some of the city's best dining spots are here. Try T8 (8 North Block, Xintiandi, Lane 181, Taicang Road, 86-21-6355-8999); meal for two, from 1,580 yuan. Or, for some of the best Chinese food in town, head to Shanghai Ye (338 Huang Pi Nan Lu, House 6 Xintiandi, by Taicang Road, 86-21-6311-2323); dinner for two, 600 yuan.    10 p.m.  8. Drinks on the Opium Bed  Finish up your last night in Shanghai by visiting another set of great night spots. Face is one of the most impressive (118 Rui Jin 2 Road, Building 4, Rui Jin Guest House, 86-21-6466-4328). Set in a colonial villa, Face has a bar stocked with cool designs, Asian antiques and even an opium bed where couples can relax with a drink. And if you don't easily tire, take a taxi to South Beauty 881 (881 Central Yanan Road, 86-21-6247-1581), a spicy Sichuan and Cantonese restaurant with bar and lounge connected to an old French mansion. But one of my favorite spots is a little-known place called the Door (1468 Hongqiao Road, third floor; 86-21-6295-3737), which offers an hourlong musical performance beginning at 10 every night but Sunday. The nine-member band plays modern folk music fused with Western styles. They perform using Western and traditional Chinese instruments, like the erhu and the pipa. There's also a short Beijing Opera performance. The interior design -- which makes stylish use of antiques -- is about as good as it gets in Shanghai.    Sunday    9 a.m.  9. The Way They Were  A nice place to go to pick up some gifts and souvenirs in Shanghai is the Dongtai Road antiques lanes. Walking through the area will also offer a glimpse of the way some residents continue to live, in crowded apartments, often without indoor plumbing or cooking facilities. The items for sale might include jewelry boxes with Qing dynasty imprints on them, Mao watches, Cultural Revolution-era posters, old coins, books, statues and porcelain. Be prepared to bargain and assume that very little is authentic.    10:30 a.m.  10. Back for Brunch  Finish your weekend off by going back to the old French Concession area for brunch at Azul, a tapas restaurant that offers one of the best Western breakfasts in town (18 Dongping Road, near Wulumuqi Road, 86-21-6433-1172). Try the 119-yuan brunch set menu, which will allow you to choose a fresh baby spinach salad, an omelet with basil, sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese and asparagus, or blueberry pancakes.    THE BASICS       Shanghai is served by two airports, Hongqiao, which is a 20-to-30-minute ride from downtown, and Pudong International Airport, which mainly caters to long-distance travelers, a little more than an hour's ride from the city. Flights from New York begin at about $850. Cabs from Pudong generally cost 158 yuan, or $20 at 8 yuan to $1, and there is no tipping. Or you can take the ultrafast maglev train, for 50 yuan but you'll still have to change to a taxi for 40 yuan to get all the way downtown.      The Grand Hyatt (Jin Mao Tower, 88 Century Boulevard, Pudong; 86-21-5049-1234), across the river from downtown, is the city's most spectacular hotel; doubles are 1,850 to 3,400 yuan, or $234 to $430. But it's in Pudong, and while the tunnel is close by, traffic can be a problem. Closer to the center are the Four Seasons Hotel (500 Weihai Road; 86-21-6256-8888; 3,105 yuan) and the JW Marriott Hotel (Tomorrow Square, 399 Nanjing Road West; 86-21-5359-4969; 2,875 yuan). Less expensive is the Donghu Hotel (70 Donghu Road; 86-21-6415-8158; 794 to 1,058 yuan) and the Old Jin Jiang Hotel (59 Mao Ming Road South; 86-21-6258-2582; 1,400 to 1,750 yuan). 36 Hours in Shanghai"},{"year":"1976","title":"Israeli Prime Min Yitzhak Rabin on May 24 refuses request by group of Israeli Arab leaders to cancel govt plans to take over Arab land in Galilee area","excerpt":"also turns down demands for special inquiry into riots in Galilee (S) RABIN REJECTS PLEA BY ARABS ON LAND"},{"year":"1974","title":"NJ bd of Public Utility Comrs on Sept 5 reject demand by State's Public Advocate that NJ Bell Telephone Co's request for $155-million rate increase be dismissed","excerpt":"also turns down motion for recision of controversial adjustment clause that allows co to pass on all increased operating costs to consumers without formality of going through rate hearing; NJ Bell is only utility in nation with such adjustment clause; bd pres Anthony J Grossi says that request for recision had been unanimously turned down because adjustment clause was already focus of suit pending before NJ Sup Ct; tells William Gural, head of Public Advocate's office, that motion for recision sould be renewed at future time; Comr Joel Jacobson directs Gural to renew his application for recision, indicating he is speaking for himself rather than bd; arguments on adjustment clause are scheduled to be heard by Sup Ct later in Sept, and clause will have to be revd by utility bd before Jan 1, effective date of pass-along on utility's cost increases for '74 (M) BELL WINS ROUND ON RATE"},{"year":"1953","title":"Auto and truck output repts, Oct, US G.

Portugal traces its origins back to the warlike Lusitanian tribes of Roman times. The nation-state originated as a county of the kingdom of Leon-Castile, reconquered from the Moors in the 11th century. Portugal won recognition as an independent kingdom in 1143, and conquered Lisbon four years later. In 1267 the Algarve was conquered, and by then Portugal had expanded to its modern boundaries. Except for the period 1580–1640, when it was ruled by the Spanish Habsburgs, the Portuguese dynasty maintained its independence into the 20th century. Portuguese fishermen had probably frequented the Grand Banks from before the time of Columbus, and the nation's tradition of seafaring gave rise to a world empire in the 15th and 16th centuries. Prince Henry the Navigator (1394–1460) colonized the Azores and the Madeiras and sponsored voyages of exploration along the west coast of Africa. Under his successors, Portugal controlled the west African coast, the shores of the Indian Ocean, and large stretches of southern Asia, as well as, in the Western Hemisphere, Brazil. Yet the rise of the empires of Spain and the Netherlands quickly reduced the Portuguese to second-rank status, leaving only Macao, Goa, and Timor in Asia; Portuguese Guinea (Guinea Bissau), Mozambique, and Angola in Africa; and the great territory of Brazil in Latin America. In the 19th century, a series of dynastic civil wars weakened the monarchy, allowing Britain to gain control of the country's foreign policy (in addition to the wine trade of Oporto, long in British hands). Brazil declared its independence in 1822. In 1910 Portugal became the first kingdom in the 20th century to be transformed into a republic. But in the next 15 years, chaos ensued: eight presidents, 44 governments, and a nearcollapse of the economy. Finally, the military established a dictatorship, lasting until recent times. In 1928 the military installed a civilian dictator, a professor of economics, Antonio Salazar. A firm believer in law and order, he managed to control the turbulence of political life and made the escudo one of Europe's most stable currencies, yet he could do nothing to alter Portugal's fundamental poverty. Although he ruled through civilian governments, his essential support always came from the army. Portugal has long been Western Europe's poorest country. As late as 1960, almost half of the country's work force was engaged in agriculture, forestry, and fishing. In the north, agriculture was traditionally carried on in smallholdings; the south was characterized by large estates, remnants of feudal fiefs. Exports were traditionally cork, olive oil, port wine, and fish. Industrialization came late to Portugal, and today manufacturing is mostly carried on by small firms engaged in textile and clothing production and other labor-intensive production. World War II affected Portugal very little. Salazar deftly managed to remain Britain's ally while keeping his country out of the war as a neutral state. In the postwar period, Portugal accepted Marshall Plan aid and became a member of NATO in 1949. Portugal was a founding member of the European Free Trade Association in 1959 and negotiated a special relationship with the EC in 1972 (when its trading partner and ally, Great Britain, joined that body). Portugal joined the United Nations in 1955, just in time to become embroiled in the worldwide movement for decolonization. Protesting that Portugal had, not colonies, but “overseas provinces,” Salazar refused to bow to the pressure of world opinion. In 1961 India forcibly annexed Goa and other Portuguese enclaves on the subcontinent. In the same year, nationalist revolts broke out in Angola, Guinea and Mozambique. The colonial wars of the 1960's placed a terrible strain on Portugal's economy and resulted in severe military losses. Salazar, gravely ill, retired in 1968 and was replaced by Marcelo Caetano. In 1974 Caetano was deposed in a bloodless coup staged by the secret Armed Forces movement. The coup's leader, Antonio de Spinola, after reaching agreements on the independence of most of Portugal's old colonies, resigned as head of government in September 1974. Costa Gomes replaced Spinola, as a Revolutionary Council was instituted. The council survived two coup attempts, one by right-wing soldiers, the other by Communists, and it promulgated a Socialist constitution in 1976. Through a series of unstable governments (16 between 1974 and 1987), the old agrarian estates were expropriated, and banking, insurance, and large industrial concerns were nationalized. The shock of this economic transformation, along with the OPEC price rises, created a recession in the 1970's. In addition Portugal had to absorb a million Portuguese refugees from the former colonies. Attempts by center-right coalitions in the 1980's to undo the nationalizations of the 1970's were thwarted by vetoes of the Constitutional Tribunal (successor to the Revolutionary Council), even when the free-market Social Democratic party held an absolute majority in the assembly. Portugal entered the EC on Jan. 1, 1986, pledging to reduce tariffs and end agricultural subsidies over a 10-year transitional period. In 1987 the Social Democrats, running on a platform of spending cuts, privatization of state-owned firms, reversal of agricultural collectivism, and reliance on free enterprise, became the first party since 1974 to win an absolute majority in the legislative assembly. Per capita income tripled over the years 1985–92, so that Portugal was no longer the poorest country in the E.U. The 1992 sale of the huge state-owned Petrogal oil company was a harbinger of a return to free enterprise. In Oct. 1995, Antonio Guterres of the Socialist party displaced the Social Democrats. And in January 1996, Jorge Sampaio won the presidential election, giving Portugal both a Socialist president and prime minister for the first time since democracy was restored. Portugal's economic stability was ratified in 1998 by the E.U. when the latter approved Portugal's membership in the Monetary Union. GDP growth averaged 3.5 percent through the late 1990's. In Dec. 1999 the colony of Macao was returned to Chinese rule after 442 years. In 2001 Sampaio was easily reelected. But the December loss by the Socialists of numerous municipal elections, including Lisbon and Oporto, led Sampaio to dissolve Parliament. March elections then brought another center-right coalition as the Social Democrats took 102 (of 230) seats, selecting Manual Durao Barroso as prime minister.

Director Claude Sautet, a man able to devote his full attention to the tiniest of issues, takes pains to explain those things he shows us, but the movie has no guiding spirit or identifiable raison d'être. Nothing about it really commands the attention.Mado, (Ottavia Piccolo) the young woman of the title, is sullen and indecipherable, so it's just as well that her importance to the film is relatively slight. She has two groups of acquaintances, working-class kids and older, prosperous businessmen, and we are made to understand that she hires herself out to members of the latter group because members of the former are out of work. Mado only sleeps around enough to support herself, and she doesn't buy anything she doesn't need","excerpt":"also, she doesn't behave this way for pleasure, because she doesn't like anybody. This isn't sex, it's economic reality.One of Mado's well-heeled admirers is Simon. (Michel Piccoli) a wealthy land developer, and it's Simon and his business that most of the film is about. Much of the plot centers around a real-estate deal, and there is a certain amount to be surmised from watching the businessmen's manners and mores. Soon enough, though, the inherent excitement of the real-estate deal begins to pall, and all that remain are vague but somehow familiar observations about the bourgeoisie.Every now and then, Mado reappears to hammer home some comparison between free spirits and captive ones. In one scene, for example, Simon tries to make some coffee but is annoyed to learn that he can't operate his fancy new coffee machine. Then Mado leans over and gives the thing a twist, and it works perfectly. Sacre bleu!The performances by Piccoll, Charles Denner (as one of Mado's beaux) and Romy Schneider (as an alcoholic in love with Piccoli) are unexpectedly moving, especially since one seldom knows why any of these characters is behaving as he or she behaves. Mr. Piccoli's role is terribly ill-defined, but he manages to give a general impression of concern.Mr. Sautet's ending for the film is much more interesting than the slush that precedes it. Mado's two groups of friends begin to resemble one another, and to drift together, until they all wind up making an expedition to look over an important parcel of building lots (for the businessmen) and a ramshackle old farm (for the hippies). Then the party heads home, but a rainstorm and a traffic jam induce them all to leave the main road. They wind up knee-deep in mud in the countryside and it is there that everyone does something or other to reflect his or her true nature. The whole episode has the feeling of a failed Robert Altman movie as seen through a very thick fog.

The program includes principally scenes of the coast of Java, shots of an exciting tiger hunt in Siam, and many views of the natives of Frederick Henry Island, which is separated by a narrow strait from the island of New Guinea. There are absorbing pictures of strange Polynesian people called Kia Kias, at their dances, going through the routine of their domestic life, and ceremoniously arrayed in their outlandish dress, decorated, according to their idea, with sticks in their noses, paint on their faces and hideous scars on their bodies.In the advertising of the pictures, and in many of their subtitles, much is made of the dangers of the cameramen, the story told being to the effect that they were shipwrecked on Frederick Henry Island for five months and were often in danger of being eaten alive. The evidence of the pictures is that this story was an afterthought on the part of some press agent. Though they are said to have landed in the face of danger, they did not fail to take pictures of the approaching cannibals, and their first night on the island, spent in momentary fear of attack, according to the yarn, is illustrated by \\"night scenes\\" which must have been made in the daytime, including a beautiful picture of the sun labelled \\"Fair Luna.\\" At other times when the savages are said to be menacing, one cannot escape the impression that they are posing and performing for so much tobacco or rum an hour. One scene of a supposed war dance is said to have been made by a cameraman who worked in concealment at the risk of his life, yet several of those in the picture appear to be watching him with more curiosity than hostility.All of this stuff is not necessary. The pictures are good enough to \\"go\\" without it, and much space is used up by subtitles telling the unconvincing story that might have been devoted to the giving of interesting information about the life and habits of the savages. In fact, there are many things one would like to know about the pictures that are not told.A husband absorbed in his work exposes his wife to the allurements of a male vampire, to whom the wife will probably say, \\"Yes,\\" if the husband is rich, and \\"No,\\" if the husband is poor","excerpt":"also, the wealthy wife who seeks love from the villain will surely come to a bad end, such as suicide while the poor woman who faithfully drudges at home, and will not even go to the movies with her tempter, will live to enjoy health, wealth and happiness, through her husband's suddenly achieving success, as by the invention of a washing machine; and so will virtue be rewarded and frailty punished in this world of unerring justice—according to the moral teaching of \\"Yes or No,\\" an adaptation of Arthur Goodrich's play, at the Strand this week, with Norma Talmadge doubling in the leading rôles.The story goes vigorously at first, detailing the parallel lives of the two women, and about midway in its course reaches a high point of dramatic interest, motion pictures being used adroitly to bring out the essentials of contrast and similarity between the situations faced by the separate wives. With its momentum developed, however, the plot is satisfied to slow down and settle into a rut of theatrical unreality and false moralizing, along which it drags its way to an unduly postponed ending. It is a pity that whoever was responsible for the picture did not realize its possibilities. It could have been genuine and convincing throughout.The fault is in the story. The acting is generally good. In each of her rôles Miss Talmadge is as pleasing to look upon and as definite in pantomime as she is usually is, and she receives competent assistance from her sister Natalie as the maid of the rich wife and the sister of the poor one. Others in the cast are Lowell Sherman and Gladden James as the villains. Frederick Burton and Radcliffe Fellows as the husbands, and Edward S. Broony as one of the \\"undeserving poor\\" who says that success comes to \\"the guy who puts over something\\" rather than to him who works hard, and who, of course, is refuted by the facts—of this particular piece of fiction. The direction of the production by R. William Neill is good, on the whole, though some of the scenes could have been more effectively lighted.\\"Pyrenees and Wooden Legs,\\" a Chester scenic, and the Topical Review are also on the Strand program.It is doubtful whether the combination of the human voice with motion pictures, as introduced at the Capitol recently by S. L. Rothapfel, is of dramatic value. In one or two pictures at the Capitol the chorus on the stage has been called upon to sing, shout or murmur during certain climactic scenes, but instead of heightening the effect the sound has rather distracted the spectators by jerking their attention from the pictures, and what force the scenes might have had has been dissipated by competition rather than strengthened by co-operation. Or so it has seemed to the writer, who feels that, whereas music may accompany a photoplay to its advantage, too literal interpretation of particular pictures by the human voice deprives the spectator of his last excuse for using his imagination and is jarringly inconsistent with the characteristic silence of the screen.However, there are times when the voice may be used effectively, and one of them is Hy Mayer's latest Travelaugh, \\"Such Is Life at Coney Island,\\" at the Capitol this week. Mr. Mayer's bright sketches and scenes from life are enlivened by an orthodox barker on the stage and a chorus turned rabble for the moment, so that the sounds as well as the sights of Coney are reproduced. The whole is entertaining.\\"The Best of Luck,\\" adapted from a Drury Lane melodrama, directed by Ray C. Smallwood, with Kathryn Adams and Jack Holt at the head of the cast, is the photoplay at the Capitol. It is as wholly incredible, internally incongruous, overtly artificial, and, for those who like stock thrills, variously exciting as a movie melodrama may be. Among its featured scenes are a motor and motorcycle race through a storm, an airplane dash over the ocean, a fight for treasure beneath the water, and a fox hunt.The Capitol program also includes an impressive sea scenic, \\"Foam Fantasies,\\" and stirring views of Yosemite Park made from an airplane. The latter are a part of the Pictorial News and presumably may be seen at the other theatres taking the Fox service.\\"The Ladder of Lies,\\" with Ethel Clayton, directed by Tom Forman, is at the Rialto; \\"Away Goes Prudence,\\" with Billie Burke, directed by John S. Robertson, is at the Rivoli, and \\"The Inner Voice,\\" with E. K. Lincoln, is at B. S. Moss's Broadway, where, also, the Chaplin revival, \\"Carmen,\\" is continued. \\"Humoresque\\" remains at the Criterion.
