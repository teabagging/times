Julie Wilson has never seemed more in her element than at Rainbow and Stars, where she and her accompanist, William Roy, are performing a program that ranges from Cy Coleman to Peter Allen to Harold Arlen, with many of the songs strung together into thematic blocks. Some wonderful comic moments (old Joe E. Lewis nightclub material","excerpt":"Arlen and E. Y. Harburg's hilarious \\"Lydia the Tattooed Lady\\") add spice to a program that reaches a dramatic peak with the singer's definitive version of Stephen Sondheim's \\"I'm Still Here.\\" Shows are at 9 and 11:15 tonight and tomorrow. There is a $35 cover charge and no minimum for the late show; dinner is required for the early show. Songs of Wartime    Andrea Marcovicci, the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street (212-840-6800). Andrea Marcovicci's new program of love songs from World War II is an astutely selected evening of swing tunes, songs about the war and ballads of separation, woven together with patter that is as witty as it is carefully researched. As in her earlier shows, Miss Marcovicci brings in commentary by others, including Dorothy Parker and Edna St. Vincent Millay. The show succeeds in finding an ideal balance between nostalgic sentiment and acute observation. Shows are at 9:15 and 11:15 tonight and tomorrow. There is a $25 music charge and a $10 drink minimum. Los Angeles Country     Cheryl Wheeler and Cliff Eberhardt, the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street (212-228-6300). Although Cheryl Wheeler, like Rosanne Cash, has been marketed as a country performer, the style of both her singing and her songwriting is closer to Los Angeles country-rock than to Nashville's musical traditions.

None of us are asking you how you are going to rule on an upcoming case. . . . But it is appropriate for us to ask you how you think, what your background is, what kind of a Justice you might be, if the advice and consent clause means anything. . . .    Judge, you entered law school 20 years ago this year, and in that 20 years, as both you and I would agree, there has been some extraordinary cases in the Supreme Court.  They have actually decided hundreds of cases, made rulings perhaps in hundreds more in that 20 years. Some may be routine, but some have been pretty significant cases.    Just tell me, to help me know how you think, what would you consider a handful of the most important cases that have been decided by the Supreme Court since you became a law student 20 years ago?    A. Senator, to give you a running list, I would have to go back and give it some thought. But I certainly think that during the time that I was in law school, two of the cases that were considered the most significant cases, or among the most significant cases, would have been certainly Griggs, which was decided while I was in law school. . . . And certainly I think Roe v. Wade. . . .    Q. Are there some other cases that come to mind in the last 20 years?    A. There would be others, Senator. I can't off the top of my head, as you mention them, perhaps I could accord some weight to them.  Just not off the top of my head.    Q. But there are none that sort of stand out that might have been cases that have influenced your thinking when you accepted the appointment to the Court of Appeals or when you accepted this appointment? Did certain things stick in your mind and you say, \\"I am being nominated to the Court that decided,\\" whatever the case might be?    A. Before my lifetime, I am being nominated to the Court that decided Brown. . . . When the President made the announcement that I would be nominated to the Supreme Court. That is certainly one of the cases, even before I knew all of the legal ramifications, it is one that changed my life and changed the South, and, of course, even though I did not go to desegregated schools until I was virtually an adult.     Q. . . . You would accept, I would assume, that people don't expect the second a judge puts on a robe that it is like an eraser going across a blackboard and their whole life is wiped out, all their thoughts, all their feelings, their prejudices, and I don't use that in a pejorative form, but just all their feelings they have toward everything is suddenly wiped out.      A. With respect to judges and what happens when you become a judge, I, quite frankly, don't know that any of us who, prior to becoming judges, understood exactly how it would change us. I could not have told you when I was here for the Court of Appeals exactly how it would change me. I can tell you, and I think most judges would tell you, that it is not necessarily like an eraser, but it is a profound change.      Q. Lewis Lehrman's analysis concludes that because the right to liberty attaches at conception that abortion of any sort is unconstitutional. Do you agree with that conclusion?    A. As I indicated, Senator, to you in our last discussion, I have read this article; and as I have noted throughout my testimony and in discussions in reference to this article, my only interest was as stated: to demonstrate to a conservative audience that one of their own used this notion of natural rights -- --   Q. Judge, I ----   A. ---- and the second point is that, as I have indicated, I do not endorse that conclusion. . . .    Q. I am not sure just which conclusion we are talking about. I am talking about Lehrman's conclusion that all abortion, under any circumstance -- which, of course, would go way beyond any overruling of a Supreme Court decision or anything else, but his conclusion that all abortion is unconstitutional, do you accept that conclusion? . . .   A. And what I am trying to do, Senator, is to respond to your question and at the same time not offer a particular view on this difficult issue of abortion that would undermine my impartiality.    The point that I am making is that I have not, nor have I ever, endorsed this conclusion or supported this conclusion. . . . QUESTIONS BY SENATOR SPECTER    Q. I want to come to the Yale Law School admission, and not to personalize it with you, but take Professor Steven Carter, who is an African-American, a distinguished professor now at Yale, Yale being a very good law school. Professor Carter has just written a book, \\"Affirmative Action Baby,\\" and he says flat out that he enjoyed the benefits of racial preference. . . .   Why shouldn't the law school like Yale give a preference, to give that person an opportunity to blossom fully, even though on the test scores at the moment that African-American doesn't measure up quite to the white person he has displaced?    A. . . . I think that during that era, those of us who were then the beneficiaries of what were called preferential treatment programs, I think that was the exact terminology that, it was an effort to determine whether kids had been disadvantaged, had socioeconomic disadvantages, had done very, very well in other endeavors against those odds.  . . .   That is a difficult, subjective determination, but I thought that it was one that was appropriately made. One of the aspects of that is that the kids could come from any background of disadvantage. The kid could be a white kid from Appalachia, could be a Cajun from Louisiana, or could be a black kid or Hispanic kid from the inner-cities or from the barrios, but I defended that sort of a program then and I would defend it today.      Q. Judge, I hear you very close to my position, but what I believe I am hearing is that you are in favor of affirmative action preference, at least in that context.    A. I think I have said that.      Q. I would turn to one critical line from Professor Carter's book, which I think really puts in a nutshell much of this affirmative action debate, when he says, \\"The reason for the surge is to find the blacks among the best, not the best among the blacks,\\" and that if you have the affirmative action, as you concur, on preference in law school, then the potential is developed through a Professor Carter or a Judge Thomas. . . .    A. . . . I have been an aggressive advocate of giving minorities the opportunity and the occasion to develop potential.  QUESTIONS BY SENATOR BIDEN    Q. Before I yield to the Senator from Alabama, a point of clarification. Did you say, Judge, that affirmative action preference programs are all right as long as they are not based on race?    A. I said that from a policy standpoint I agreed with affirmative action policies that focused on disadvantaged minorities and disadvantaged individuals in our society.  QUESTIONS BY SENATOR HEFLIN    Q. Let me look a little bit -- from your life and history, you are somewhat of an enigma. You have gone through many changes in your life, and the last three decades of society in America has gone through many changes.  The thinking of individuals evolve, they change with time.    You have told us about your background in your opening statement and through testimony here. It is interesting to note that you decided at one time in your life that you wanted to study to be a priest, and you went to a seminary and then to a seminary in Missouri. . . .   A. Well, Senator, with respect to going to the seminary, of course, that is always a very, very deeply personal choice, it is a deeply personal religious choice. When you make that decision at 15, there is always opportunity for change and growth and development.    The point that I was in my first year of college, though, and beginning to grow and to develop as an adult, I can still remember that afternoon -- actually, it was in the evening -- that one of the students who was walking up the stairs in front of me, whose name I have never revealed and won't, didn't know I was behind him, and someone yelled from the basement, \\"Martin Luther King has been shot,\\" and he said, without looking behind him to see that I was there, \\"That's good, I hope the s.o.b. dies.\\" That was the moment, the precise moment that I decided to leave the seminary and the moment when I began to be involved personally in much of the marches and participating in changing our society, and left the seminary.      Q. Of course, part of this I think shows you do have a sensitivity to the factors that have occurred relative to the movement or progress of race relations, and I think that ought to be brought out, in fairness to all parties concerned.  Major and Minor    Now, you went to Holy Cross. What did you major in at Holy Cross?    A. Well, I transferred to Holy Cross for my sophomore year and I majored in English literature. . . .    Q. What did you minor in?    A. I think protest. (laughter)     A. When I went to Holy Cross, there was a tremendous amount going on, and one of the areas that was of great concern to me was what I perceived at that age as injustices in our society, and what I attempted to do was to be involved and to protest and be active in protesting what I thought were injustices in a way that is permitted in our society. . . .   Q. In this Los Angeles Times article, it says, \\"Today, he seems embarrassed about those days.\\"    A. No.    Q. Do you want to respond to that?    A. No, I am no more embarrassed about feeling strongly and passionately about injustice than I am about doing anything else in my life. I think that I would rather have those days of wanting to participate in our political process, even though I have grown and matured, than saying that I spent all of my college days drinking beer and having a good time.      Q. Why did you decide to go to law school and become a lawyer?    A. . . . You know, we all wanted to change the world at that time. I guess at that age you think you actually can go out and change the world. I wanted to right some wrongs that I saw in Savannah, some specific wrongs with respect to my grandfather and what he was able to do with his life, as well as to the overall wrongs that I saw as a child there. . . .   Q. I started talking about your biographical, that you were in an enigma. . . . What is the real Clarence Thomas like or what will the real Clarence Thomas do on the Supreme Court, if he is confirmed? . . .   A. Senator, I think that during the past 10 weeks, people have written and formed conclusions about me, and that has gotten to be a part of this process. I think they are free to do that. . . .    But those conclusions that people form about you were not -- about me -- were not the real Clarence Thomas. I am the real Clarence Thomas, and I have attempted to bring that person here and to show you who he was, not just snippets from speeches or snippets from articles. . . . But, by and large, the point is I am just simply different from what people painted me to be. . . .  QUESTIONS BY SENATOR SIMON    When you told about being a student at Holy Cross, I would feel comfortable voting for that student for the Supreme Court. And then in describing yourself, you said, \\"Then we thought we really could change the world\\" --making it past tense.    Some of us still think we can change the world. Maybe not in huge giant steps, but in little steps. And you are going to a place where you are going to change the world for a lot of people. . . .   Frankly, a person with Clarence Thomas' ability is going to make out all right. Whether you get confirmed or not confirmed, you are going to do very well. That 10th-grade dropout may not do well. . . .   A. Senator, when I spoke earlier about changing the world, I think I would distinguish between the way that as a youth you feel that you can go out and take on everything tomorrow morning and get it all accomplished tomorrow morning. At some point I think you realize that you have to take a step back and begin to approach it more -- not so much in a rush or impatiently, but persistently. And if there was one lesson that I learned during that period, it was the difference between impatience and persistence, the difference between being upset and being committed to something. . . . QUESTIONS BY SENATOR KOHL    Q. Judge Thomas, you have been extremely critical of the Senate's rejection of Judge Bork. In fact, in a 1987 speech to the 1988 Business Law Section, you said that the Senate's failure to confirm Judge Bork was \\"a tragedy.\\" I am interested in your views on how the Senate should discharge its advice and consent responsibility, so would you tell us what it was about the Senate's rejection of Judge Bork that was so improper?    A. I guess, Senator, the point for me there and, again, my approach if I were making the decision, I think each member of this body would have to decide for himself, but my view was that Judge Bork was qualified as to his temperament, as to his competence, and certainly qualified as to his overall abilities.

And, while it is impudent about sex, it is also a lampoon without real substance.Fernandel, the veteran comic, who, at this point, conceivably might be tired of being termed droll but who, nevertheless, deserves that description, receives ample opportunity to display his uncommon talents.

This \\"Napoleon of hair-dressers,\\" who styles himself a \\"creator of ecstasies,\\" soars high enough to enthrall himself and is only brought back to a simpler, less sophisticated life by the prospect of the loss of his adoring, realistic wife.Although he is well nigh effecting a tour de force, M.

Review/Pop","excerpt":"Armatrading In the Mood For Rocking"},{"year":"1995","title":"Shyness and intimacy are two qualities one doesn't normally expect to encounter in the same performer. But the combination is part of what endears Joan Armatrading to her audience, a polite, post-collegiate crowd that likes to  sing along quietly with her best-known songs. The West Indian-born English singer and songwriter, who performed at the Beacon Theater on Wednesday evening, specializes in loose-jointed folk-rock ballads about relationships that have the tone of intimate personal correspondence and diary jottings. But for all the emotions that spill out in her lyrics, much, including the sex of her songs' characters, remains ambiguous.         In recent years, Ms. Armatrading has moved away from the soft rock for which  she is best loved and tried to build a new image as a more declamatory part-time rocker. That strategy failed to gain her a larger audience, and in her newest album, \\"What's Inside\\" (BMG), she has returned to the more reflective tone of her best 1970's work. The centerpiece of Wednesday's concert was a block of songs from the new album, performed with a violin, cello and piano trio, with Ms. Armatrading occasionally joining in on acoustic guitar.    POP REVIEW","excerpt":"Armatrading Recaptures a 70's Tone"},{"year":"1929","title":"THERE has been much ado about the censoring of a new film of M. Jacques Feyder, \\"Les Nouveaux Messieurs.\\" The official disapproval went to the length of an absolute prohibition. Coming at a moment when the French cinema has need of every encouragement it can get, this drastic measure caused a flutter of apprehension among the producers of films. It is a pity that the censor comes into action after two million francs or so have been spent in making a picture. But such troubles have a way of settling themselves in France, and M. Feyder need not precipitably abandon hope.The film is a lightly satirical skit in Parliamentary politics and politicians. At its presentation the very full house was certainly amused. If the officials of the Ministry of the Interior have issued their interdict it is not apparently because they think the film would shock the public, but because they think it would please the public only too well. In short they fear it would bring Parliament into undesirable ridicule.The Two lovers.If the film, cut or not, finally reaches the public, it will probably not be regarded as of the first order, or up to the level of the best of M. Feyder's work. The plot is thin. Jacques Gaillac, a workmen's leader elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies—one of the \\"new gentlemen\\" of the title—becomes Minister of Labor. He is the lover of a little ballet dancer of the Opéra. In accordance with a well-established tradition the danseuse has a regular \\"protector,\\" the aristocratic Comte de Montoire-Grandpré, who happens to be leader of a political group in the Chamber opposed to the government. Finding that Gaillac is his rival, M. le Comte interpellates him and brings about the fall of the government. Thereupon, with subtle wisdom, he contrives that Gaillac shall be appointed to an important post in the service of the League of Nations, and away from Paris. The \\"new gentleman's\\" love for the little Suzanne is not proof against the temptation of interest, and the danseuse returns to the friend who knows how to behave like a real gentleman.This skeleton of a story is clothed with various comic scenes and incidents, most of them imbued with a spirit of not ill-natured raillery against politicians, and these form the real substance of the film.The late M. Robert de Flers, who was the principal author of the original comedy from which the film takes its name and inspiration, had given his plot a body and a soul by means of the witty dialogue of which he was a master. In all his plays the actual story counted for little and his delicious mots were everything. Without the pointed words, M. Feyder had, of course, to embellish and even add to the scenes. He has made some of them very amusing, such as the dancing class at the Opéra, the sitting of the Chamber of Deputies, and the charming dream of a Deputy who sees the solemn benches peopled by piquant little creatures in the tutu of the ballet. The Chamber is a caricature and its sitting ends in something approaching a free fight. This particular picture, and that of a Minister running breathless and top-hat-less to catch a train, seem to be responsible for most of the annoyance felt by the authorities. Not all M. Feyder's scenes are of equal value, and the photography is not free from fault, but his film is certainly amusing.An Intriguing Film.A new Paramount film, \\"La Vierge Folle,\\" is an excellent example of a really effective translation from the stage to the screen of a play which lends itself to that delicate process. The play of Henry Bataille is packed full of action, and its dramatic development is singularly clear and intense. The film, produced by M. Luits-Morat, could hardly have been more successful in preserving these qualities. The story is simple and strongly designed. If it is open to any reproach it is that of being too \\"well made,\\" too artfully dramatic to be quite true. Diane, the \\"foolish virgin,\\" falls in love with a 40-year-old barrister, Armaury, who gives to his charming wife Fanny only a rather vague and conventional affection. Loved by two women, Armaury is unable to resist the passion of the girl of 18. Their intrigue is reported to the girl's parents, and by them to Fanny, the wife. Diane is to be put in safety in a convent, but she drives to Armaury's office and whirls her hesitating lover, for all his misgivings, into a passionate resolution to run away with her. This decision is no sooner taken than Fanny arrives at her husband's office, heartbroken. The girl's young and hot-headed brother Gaston also comes in, bent on vengeance. The scene which follows, finely conceived and finely acted, is remarkably tense. Fanny discovers that the girl is in an adjoining room, but she conceals the whole situation from the girl's brother, pretending that all his suspicions are misplaced and that everything is well between herself and her husband. And all this time, while she is talking, she knows that her husband, in the adjoining room, is making up his mind whether to fly or stay. The sound of the street door closing makes her aware of what the decision is","excerpt":"Armaury and the girl have gone away together. The lovers have, in fact, gone to London, and we see them next in the Savoy Hotel. They are found out, and Fanny and Gaston go to see them. The wife, with a resignation not lacking in dignity, arrives at the decision to leave her husband to his new happiness, but Gaston, concerned about the honor of the family, is sterner. He breaks into the lovers' apartment holding a revolver; intending to kill Armaury. The girl disarms him, and then ends her mad escapade and brings the whole drama to its climax by shooting herself.In the play itself, as conceived by Bataille, there is an admirable balance between the actions and motives of the four principal characters. This is delightfully reflected in the acting of the film; and one has rarely seen such an effective ensemble. Miss Emmy Lynn plays Fanny's most difficult scene with sure touch and a just appreciation of motive. As Armaury, M. Jean Angelo is vacillating without overstressing the points of the character, and Susy Vernon gives a well-drawn picture of the spontaneous girlish passion of Diane. The Gaston of M. Pierre Fresnay is excellent in spirit, and the only defect of that clever artist's performance is a certain exaggeration of gesture which is suited to the stage but not to the screen.\\"Verdun.\\"It is a little difficult to render in writing the impression made by \\"Verdun, Visions, d'Histoire,\\" the latest in the ever-lengthening series of war films. For one thing, military operations in the late war were much alike. The idea of M. Leon Poirier, who has designed and produced it, is to give a cinematographic representation of the classic battle which is almost documentary, relieved by the merest thread of story. At frequent intervals a map thrown on the screen shows the ebb and flow of the offensives of one side or the other. Pictures of all the big and famous incidents round Douaumont, the fort of Vaux, Thiaumont, the Bois de Caures, make up the bulk of the film. It is all admirably done. M. Poirier used some actual war films taken during the battle, and he made other parts of the picture on the spot, largely with the aid of ex-soldiers. He has carried out the \\"artificial\\" part of his work so well that it is difficult to distinguish it from the rest. The result is a drama often fascinating in the monotony of its grimness, inspiring equally admiration, horror and pity. While there is naturally a very definite appeal to French patriotism, there are few false notes and the Germans are presented without rancor. No names are given to the personages whose adventures, heroic or pathetic, compose the story of the film. These are merely indicated as \\"The French Soldier,\\" \\"The German Soldier,\\" \\"The Marshal of the Empire,\\" \\"The Mother,\\" \\"The Old Peasant\\" and such representative characters. From time to time in the battle scenes these recognizable individuals become visible to the spectator, and this helps to give a touch of artistic reality to a drama which, by its nature, tends to be drowned in anonymity.

Mr. Sonfist realizing that ants are not too unlike humans, places food, apple cores mostly, in various parts of the sand&#8208;covered enclosure and gets them to shape up in different geometric patterns. The ants are rather better behaved than Man at buffet dining and the effect is possibly esthetic depending upon the beholder, and they are absolutely hypnotic, even when they were visited during an uncreative midday. One watches the sinuous stream of traffic, with almost never a tie&#8208;up and wonders what makes the insects so orderly. The exhibition ends March 17, by which time the artist says the ants will have selected and stabilized their own patterns rather than the ones designed (and shown in a wall display) by Mr. Sonfist. The viewing is done over a high wall surrounding the enclosure, which is lined with an unscalable plastic to prevent ant leakage The ants, who use their own bodies as building modules, were brought here from Panama and are bigger than our usual picnic ants. The hours for visiting are 9:30 A.M. to 7 P.M., Monday through Friday. Admission is free.
