Even as the world focused on Rome and the successor to a pope who, in the aftermath of 9/11, said that terrorism was ''often the outcome of that fanatic fundamentalism which springs from the conviction that one's own vision of the truth must be forced upon everyone else,'' terror's long shadow cast Americans back 10 years, 6 years, 4 years: There was the Oklahoma City bombing. There was the Colorado school shooting. There was, as ever, Sept. 11, 2001.    Tracking -- The State Department said Monday that it would stop publishing annual data on terrorism attacks worldwide. Last year, the department reported a decline in significant events, then issued a correction showing an increase. The supposed falloff had been used to bolster President Bush's claim of success against terrorism.    Honoring -- On Tuesday, Vice President Dick Cheney and former President Bill Clinton led a delegation marking the 10th anniversary of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The bombing, the work of Americans, killed 168 people. The site is now a place of pilgrimage that features 168 bronze chairs, their glass bottoms etched with the names of the dead. A week of remembrance included a reunion of relatives, survivors and rescuers.    WEDNESDAY    Grieving -- On Wednesday, Coloradans marked the sixth anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings, the April morning when two students killed 12 classmates, a teacher and themselves. There were no formal observances, but Columbine students were given the day off, and teachers gathered at the school for a remembrance.     Plans for an elaborate memorial have stalled because less than half of the $2.5 million cost has been raised. The design calls for a grove of trees, and water falling over etched stone walls.    Suing -- Asmaa Elshinawy, above, was among five Muslim-American New Yorkers who sued the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday, saying they were targets of racial profiling when they were detained by border agents after returning from a religious conference in Toronto in December.     Addressing the reach of the government's efforts in fighting terrorism, Valerie Smith, a spokeswoman for the department, said, ''Terrorists only have to get it right once.''    Searching -- The State Department offered $5 million rewards for information leading to the capture of two men, born in Tunisia and now citizens of Canada, who it believes may be bent on suicide attacks.    FRIDAY    Pleading -- On Friday, Zacarias Moussaoui, above -- the only person charged in an American court in the 9/11 attacks -- pleaded guilty to helping Al Qaeda carry out the attacks. On the same day, 24 people went on trial in Madrid on terrorism charges","excerpt":"three are accused of helping plan the 9/11 attacks.    Quarreling -- New York City fire officials, citing firefighters' expertise, said they opposed a plan to give the police primacy at the scene of a biological or chemical attack. And in Portland, Ore., on Friday, the mayor cited philosophical differences with the F.B.I. in announcing that he was pulling Portland's police force out of the F.B.I.'s antiterrorism task force.    Screening -- Friday was also the day that the first of an expected flow of movies about the 9/11 attacks had its premiere, at the TriBeCa Film Festival in New York. The film is called ''The Great New Wonderful.''

(Though where is the unanimously missing note near the start of \\"Every valley?\\" Was that the byte that got away?) There is a handy chart in the booklet outlining the contents of each of the three disks, detailing which tracks (shaded in gray) you should replace with tracks from an appendix at the end of the disk to recreate whichever of Handel's nine original versions you want.

Record companies, eager to tap the vast catalogues they had amassed, saw an opportunity to sell old wine in new bottles.   \\"Crossroads\\" has gone on to sell more than two million copies in this country alone, and the boom that it sparked has, if anything, accelerated. Boxed sets, once the fare of late-night television commercials, have become big business, a particular favorite for holiday gifts. Here are 15 choices that Times critics found worthy of note.

For pretty much two centuries after his death, in 1759, he was remembered primarily as a composer of oratorios, anthems, concertos, suites and sonatas: music that bolstered a gentlemanly image of magnificence and decisiveness. His operas, so much more pliant and equivocal in tone, were largely forgotten until the 1920's. In 1927 he finally made his debut as an opera composer in the United States, when Smith College staged ''Giulio Cesare,'' which remained for several decades the Handel opera of choice. Most of the others had to wait until after World War II for their first modern performances, and only in the last two decades have a good number of them begun to be regularly produced and recorded.    The process of familiarization goes on. On Friday, the second night of its new season, the New York City Opera presents Handel's ''Partenope'' in a production introduced at Glimmerglass during the summer, and two new recordings of other Handel operas have just appeared on the Virgin Veritas label. ''Admeto'' (7243 5 61369","excerpt":"three CD's) comes in a version that was first released 20 years ago; the ''Rodelinda'' (7243 5 45277; three CD's) is new.

His flamboyant scenic cantata \\"Carmina Burana\\" is occasionally performed on pops programs or by ballet companies. His educational ideas, usually adulterated by the Kodaly method or another pedagogical approach, are still applied in schools. But of the considerable breadth of his achievement, there is little representation.   So the budget reissue of the sole studio recording of Orff's quasi-opera \\"Antigonae\\" (Deutsche Grammophon 437 721-2","excerpt":"three CD's) is of particular interest. Now available by import and set for American release later this year, it can be profitably compared with a newly released historical album of the 1949 world premiere at the Salzburg Festival (Stradivarius STR 10060; two CD's). Orff: Two Second Thoughts"},{"year":"1993","title":"A few weeks ago, at the Opera-Comique after a performance of Rameau's opera-ballet \\"Les Indes Galantes,\\" the American conductor William Christie was inducted into the French Legion of Honor. Mr. Christie spoke glowingly of \\"your beautiful country,\\" to which he has dedicated the last two decades of his life. But the French encomiums to him and his work were equally deserved. France has had a long history of welcoming foreigners who return the favor by fostering and developing French culture. Mr. Christie is the latest distinguished example.   Now, in time for the appearances by Mr. Christie and his early-music ensemble, Les Arts Florissants, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music next weekend, Harmonia Mundi France has rushed his recording of Rameau's opera \\"Castor et Pollux\\" into print (HMC 901435/7","excerpt":"three CD's), even prior to its French release.

But when the Nazis took power, Schreker was among the principal targets of their censors. A poster headed \\"Two Jewish Scribblers,\\" a denunciation of Schreker and Ernst Toch, called Schreker \\"the Magnus Hirschfeld of opera composers,\\" referring to a famous psychiatrist of the day, and declared contemptuously that \\"there was no sexual-pathological aberration he would not have set to music.\\"   As odious as it is to agree with Nazi censors, in this case they were right, though the assertion might be viewed as a tribute to Schreker's imagination rather than a ground for condemning him. And what an imagination it was: a new recording of Schreker's opera \\"Die Gezeichneten\\" (\\"The Branded\\"), by Lothar Zagrosek and the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester, Berlin (London 444 442-2","excerpt":"three CD's), reveals a musical and dramatic gift that rivals the combined genius of Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannsthal in their great collaborations.

Dr. Pirani, who founded Columbia's Renal Pathology Laboratory in 1973, was one of the most influential pathologists of his day. His work forged the transition from autopsy-based studies of the kidney to modern biopsybased pathologic interpretation. The semiquantitative method he developed for evaluating needle biopsies of the kidney is not only essential to establish an accurate diagnosis, but also provides valuable clinical information about disease activity and reversibility that has helped guide optimal therapy. His systematic approach has been instrumental in describing for the first time the defining features of many major renal diseases. Dr. Pirani was born in Pisa, Italy, and attended medical school in Italy. Because of racial laws enacted by the Mussolini government, he immigrated to the United States in 1939. His early career in pathology was at the University of Illinois, and he was appointed chairman of pathology at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago in 1965. In 1973, he came to Columbia University Medical Center as professor of pathology and director of the newly created Renal Pathology Laboratory. He retired from that position in 1985, becoming professor emeritus of pathology. Dr. Pirani lectured widely and published more than 200 research papers and textbook chapters over a 30year period. He is best known for his seminal observations on the clinical-pathologic features of lupus nephritis, diabetic nephropathy, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and myeloma-related renal disease, which helped form the basis of our modern understanding. In 1977, he founded the course ''Renal Biopsy in Medical Diseases of the Kidney,'' which is the longest-running continuing medical education course in the history of Columbia University Medical Center. Lectures in his name are given every year at Columbia and at the Mario Negri Institute for Renal Research in Bergamo, Italy. In 1987, he received the prestigious John Peters Award of the American Society of Nephrology for his lifetime contributions.

A select few writers -- like William Goldman, Shane Black and Robert Towne -- are paid $1 million or more a script. The vast majority scribble in obscurity and will never make a sale. \\n\\nSandwiched in between them is a small, select group of writers. They are famous -- but only to certain executives. They work a lot. They are rich, by most standards. Some of them have sold a half-dozen scripts, at $250,000 or more each, though most have never had an on-screen writing credit. Here are some members of the club.\\nCrash Leyland \\nAn Expert In Mayhem\\n\\n For the British-born screenwriter Mark St. David-Leyland, 31, the good news came all in a rush. In one four-week period in 1991, Mr. Leyland -- who goes by the name Crash -- learned that his rewrite of the thriller \\"Sniper\\" was going into production at Tri-Star and that his original screenplay for \\"One Cut From Paradise\\" had been bought for $500,000 by Warner Brothers.\\n\\nIn 1986, after meeting the producer Robert Stigwood in the south of France, Mr. Leyland, who had been working as a scuba diver, moved to Hollywood. To support himself, he spent a year writing sexual fantasies for a men's magazine. From there he segued into adult films. \\"I was,\\" he says, \\"at the bottom of the barrel.\\"\\n\\nHis first on-screen writing credit was on a triple-X movie called \\"Project Ginger.\\" That led to fifth-rate movies. \\"I got known as a rewrite guy who could do really great death scenes, with really unusual and bizarre ways to kill people,\\" he says. \\"I wasn't a script doctor so much as a death doctor.\\"\\n\\nX-rated and below-B-movies can serve writers well. Some of Mr. Leyland's earliest murder methods show up in his script for \\"One Cut From Paradise,\\" which he will co-produce for Warner Brothers. If the thriller about bomb-disposal experts gets made, Mr. Leyland will receive an additional $100,000 in producer's fees.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Sylvester Stallone has agreed to star in Mr. Leyland's \\"Judge Dredd,\\" an adaptation of a comic book, which will begin filming in January. Mr. Leyland also rewrote \\"Crockett and Bowie,\\" about the events leading to the fall of the Alamo. He is negotiating a deal with New Line to write a script based on the video game \\"Mortal Kombat.\\" And he has just finished co-writing \\"Garden Of Eden,\\" which he calls a \\"Gothic horror love story.\\"\\n\\nCuriously, for a screenwriter whose only on-screen credit was a shared one on the failed \\"Sniper,\\" Mr. Leyland is so busy with rewrites and polishes he has had to franchise. His company, British Iron Films (a reference to British Leyland, once the family business), now hires other unknown screenwriters to work on ideas Mr. Leyland is too busy to write himself. \\"We come up with good ideas and farm them out to younger writers,\\" Mr. Leyland says. \\nAdam Rodman\\nMaking Money But Still Frustrated\\n\\n It is said that Hollywood is the only place in the world where you can die from too much encouragement. If so, Adam Rodman should be dead several times over. The 35-year-old son of the film and television writer Howard Rodman (creator of \\"The $6 Million Man\\"), young Mr. Rodman sold a script called \\"The Silent Man\\" in 1985. Eight years later, he has sold or written for hire at least a dozen feature film scripts. \\"I've been working constantly since then,\\" he says, and getting paid well, too, making \\"six figures\\" for each of his projects.\\n\\nBut so far he has received only one on-screen credit -- and for that he used a pseudonym. When his draft for the 1988 Wes Craven film \\"The Serpent and the Rainbow\\" was, in his words, \\"very rewritten,\\" he had his credit altered to read A. R. Simoun, a play on an Arabic word for a hot wind that blows no good.\\n\\nMr. Rodman has plenty of explanations for his missing credentials: The development process is very slow, he says, \\"filled with pitfalls and dead ends.\\" Several of his scripts are in what he describes as \\"development hell.\\" Others languish on shelves. One, he says, was bought by Warner Brothers, which lost interest but refused to sell it to any other studio. \\n\\nFor consolation, Mr. Rodman has made a lot of money, lives comfortably on Los Angeles's west side, and is getting more work. Still, he says, \\"It is frustrating, after a while.\\"\\nJanus Cercone \\nGoing Beyond The First Credit\\n\\n Janus Cercone, whose first screen credit was last year's \\"Leap of Faith,\\" believes she is at stage two of what she calls the four stages of success -- the one that dictates, \\"Get me Janus Cercone!\\" Before \\"Leap,\\" Ms. Cercone was writing movies that were never made. Her breakthrough came in 1988, when she sold the still unproduced \\"Knock-Out,\\" about a woman who wakes up one morning and is a man. Her husband, the producer Michael Mannheim, optioned it","excerpt":"three days later Weintraub Entertainment Group bought it. Even though Weintraub Entertainment soon went bankrupt, her career was launched. Soon she was getting calls from representatives for Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda and Robert Redford.\\n\\n\\"A writer can make a very comfortable living -- six to seven figures a year -- writing things that never get produced,\\" Ms. Cercone observes. After \\"Knock-Out\\" she received offers for movies about a man who turns into a fish, a man who turns into a cat . . . you get the idea.\\n\\nMs. Cercone spent the months following the release of \\"Leap of Faith\\" doing production rewrites -- last-minute fix-ups -- for two major studios. She has recently finished a rewrite of \\"You Should See Them Play,\\" about a down-and-out minor league baseball team, for Universal, and is now writing (and will produce) a Fox remake of its 1966 William Wyler movie, \\"How to Steal a Million.\\" She has also signed on to write the words for \\"Fat Tuesday,\\" an Alan Menken musical to be shown on NBC. \\nAkiva Goldsman \\nFrom Murder To the Immortals\\n\\n A former mental health counselor, Akiva Goldsman gave up that career when he thought was beginning to sound too much like his own mother. In 1990, Mr. Goldsman wrote \\"Indian Summer,\\" the story of an autistic boy who witnesses the murder of his parents. The script was sold to the independent movie company Morgan Creek for $350,000. (The movie, which will be released under a new title, is now being filmed in Baltimore.) \\n\\n\\"The money turned my head,\\" says the 31-year-old Brooklyn-born screenwriter. \\"I dropped a tremendous amount of money.\\" He bought a convertible and put up 10 friends up in an elegant hotel for a wild weekend. \\"I probably drank too much for a little while,\\" he adds.\\n\\nMore work brought him back to his senses. He has since been paid to write a comic book fable called \\"Flesh and Ink\\" for Mel Gibson and Warner Brothers; to rewrite \\"Silent Partners\\" for the producer Dawn Steel at Disney; to co-write another comic book story, \\"Dr. Strange,\\" with the director Wes Craven, and to do a polish on \\"The Immortals\\" for the producer Ed Pressman. He spent much of last summer doing rewrites on John Grisham's \\"Client,\\" a story that, like \\"Indian Summer,\\" is about a boy who witnesses a murder.\\n\\n\\"Contrary to myth,\\" he says, \\"you can't be a moron, or untalented, and sell a script -- but you do need a good deal of luck.\\"\\nThe Warrens \\nHitching a Wagon To a Star\\n\\n Harvey and Joy Warren have ridden to obscure prominence on the back of the action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. They know how to write scenes that work for him, and as a result find their scripts being circulated in select Hollywood circles. \\n\\nThe Warrens sold their action-adventure \\"Pilot Error\\" to a small independent company for $15,000. Now they sell scripts for between $150,000 and $250,000 each -- against the promise of another $150,000 to $250,000 if the movies get made. Says Ms. Warren, the daughter of an Air Force minister, \\"I don't know where you come from, but I think $200,000 is a lot of money.\\"\\n\\nThere wasn't always that much coming in. The Warrens gave up healthy careers in television advertising and film to become full-time writers. They had a rough beginning. \\n\\n\\"We had sold the house and the cars and all our paintings and rugs and everything,\\" says the intense, bespectacled Mr. Warren. \\"We were down to $50 in the bank. We decided to keep writing.\\"\\n\\nAdds his wife: \\"Very, very fast.\\" \\n\\nThe Warrens, who are pistol enthusiasts, decided to capitalize on the current Hollywood craze for pyrotechnics. Write what you know, right? As Mr. Warren puts it: \\"I mean, the words are all in the dictionary! We said, 'We're mainstream. We know about guns. Let's go!' \\"\\n\\nThe Warrens have since written several scripts for Mr. Van Damme, including \\"Little Eagle,\\" in which he will play a man who is half Indian. Two other projects, purchased by the producer and director Richard Donner (of the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" series) also brought in money for the Warrens. One is \\"Shooters,\\" about a group of marksmen who witness a shootout and take up arms. The other is \\"Rockets Red Glare,\\" a thriller about female terrorists who kidnap the wives of a small town's cops.\\n\\nThe Warrens' work is itself creating rewrite work for a higher echelon of Hollywood scribes: The expensive rewrite master Peter Iliff (\\"Patriot Games\\") was hired to redo \\"Rockets,\\" and Gregory Widen (\\"Backdraft\\") will work on \\"Shooters.\\"\\n\\nThe Warrens have a cheerfully mercenary attitude about their talents.

They were not, after all, artists like Giorgione, Vermeer or Karel Fabritius, whose work is prized as much for its rarity as for its excellence. Boucher (1703-70) was as productive as an artist can be. Fragonard (1732-1806) spread himself wide and far, even if he could not be bothered to curry official favor. Hubert Robert (1733-1808) painted the way the rest of us breathe: regularly, steadily and all the time.

In weekly two-hour chapters, the series provides dramatized biographies of three French painters, using their works and their experiences to explore the most turbulent epoch in French history -from the Old Regime with its decadence that led to the Revolution, the rise and fall of Napoleon, and beyond. The series was produced by R. M. Arts, a Munich-based production house, in association with the BBC.\\n\\nThe initial program is devoted to Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825), the ardent neo-Classicist who was swept into the political tumult of his times and became closely allied with Napoleon as a kind of chronicler of the Revolution. Next week brings a portrait of David's student Jean-Auguste Dominique Ingres (1780-1867), the painter of the famous ''Odalisque'' in the Louvre, and a man who preferred to withdraw from contemporary events and dwell among the idealized glories of antiquity. Wrapping things up is a look at the enigmatic Theodore Gericault (1791-1824), one of the forefathers of French Romanticism.
