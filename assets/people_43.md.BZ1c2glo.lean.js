Wells, who has been baring his round British head to the lightnings of the universe for forty years or so, appears to have reached the stage where he dares admit that the cosmic may also be comic. \\"The Man Who Could Work Miracles,\\" which he wrote for Alexander Korda's London Films, is a delightfully humorous fantasy with an undertone of sober Wellsian philosophy. Like his \\"Things to Come\\" of last Spring, it is a reiteration of Mr. Wells's belief in the godlike quality and sublime destiny of man","excerpt":"unlike it, his new film contains the rueful admission that we earthbound people are not yet ready for Utopia and probably would get ourselves into a dickens of a mess if we tried to speed up evolution.Mr. Wells, whom we have long suspected of wanting to Stakhanoffize progress, invites us, at the Rivoli, to consider what would happen if some average, everyday chap suddenly was invested with the power of performing miracles and set out to change the world. For his celestial experiment he has invented George McWhirter Fotheringay, a draper's clerk in the village of Dewhinton, Essex. Roland Young has described the character perfectly, drawing him as a fumbling little man with a rabbity soul, a limited imagination and other characteristic human frailties and virtues.Discovering his unexpected gift one night in the taproom of the Long Dragon Inn when he makes a hanging lamp turn upside down and continue burning (for which, parenthetically, a not-to-be-put-upon proprietor tosses him out), Fotheringay abandons himself at first to a carnival of music-hall tricks. He materializes cats and rabbits and tigers; he raises tables and snuffs out candles; he removes freckles and cures a sprained arm; he sends a bobby to blazes and then, bethinking himself, banishes the scorched constable to San Francisco instead. He even tries to make a pert shop girl fall in love with him, but there he fails, for he has no influence over the human mind.And that is the hitch in the great Fotheringay experiment. For, no matter where he turns in his ambitious efforts to reform the world, he runs into the problem of recalcitrant human nature. He finds it won't do to make every one wealthy because that would take away the profit motive which, a banker insists, is the foundation of our civilization. When he thinks of banishing disease, he must consider what would happen to the unemployed physicians and nurses. When he casually tells a pompous land owner of his intention of launching the Golden Age that afternoon, the old boy takes down his elephant rifle and goes gunning for the dangerous lunatic.Mr. Wells insists that Fotheringay keep on trying, but it is no use. The bewildered clerk finally wills away his power and returns to his small beer in the Long Dragon Inn. Inertia was too much for him. He agrees with Mr. Wells that, much as we all would like Utopia, we cannot be rushed into it, miracles notwithstanding. Of course, Fotheringay doesn't say that. He just drains his glass, scratches his head and wonders what on earth happened.And the answer is that most of what happened was fantastically comic or vice versa. Ned Mann's trick effects and Harold Rosson's photography worked some cute miracles, and the players, from Mr. Young on down, have done a generally satisfactory job. Ralph Richardson may have been guilty of burlesquing the feudal Colonel Winstanely, but he probably felt he was playing the rôle to suit the American conception of a titled Englishman. Joan Gardner, Sophie Stewart, Ernest Thesiger and Wallace Lupino were better. Lothar Mendes's direction has achieved a sound balance between the jocund and the profound. Mr. Wells, in brief, is doing well in his new medium.

Fewer than half a dozen of the people who visited the Ca' d'Oro one recent morning found their way to the exhibition of 69 terra-cotta sculptures, which has been somewhat misleadingly titled \\"On the Origins of Canova,\\" apparently to link it, however tenuously, with the popular Canova retrospective.   There is not a Canova to be seen. But there are more than a dozen terra cottas attributed to Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini, and almost as many by Alessandro Algardi, whose reputation trailed only Bernini's in Rome during the middle of the 17th century. Francois Duquesnoy is represented, along with Stefano Maderno, Pierre Legros, Camillo Rusconi and many of the other leading sculptors working in Italy during the extraordinarily fertile years between roughly 1600 and 1750.

The debut Bat for Lashes album, ''Fur and Gold'' (Echo/Chrysalis), was recently released in Britain","excerpt":"until it gets an American release, curious listeners can buy the album as an import; it's worth it. She has a lightheaded voice and a love of mysterious, allusive lyrics. And yet there's nothing vague about this marvelous album. A propulsive song called ''Sarah'' evokes affection, contempt and jealousy for the woman (possibly dead) in the title: ''Changing from black to blonde to black to blonde/Sarah.'' In ''Horse and I'' she accompanies herself with an insistent harpsichord figure, building to an ominous (or is it joyful?) phrase: ''There's no turning back.'' And ''Prescilla,'' buoyed by an autoharp and lots of clapping, is a ghostly pop song that single-handedly justifies the import price. (Also: if you buy the import, you can be insufferably smug when the inevitable American release arrives.)    'Stranger Than Fiction'       How do you put together a memorable movie soundtrack? The producers of ''Stranger Than Fiction,'' starring Will Ferrell, hit upon a simple but ingenious solution: just call Britt Daniel, from the Austin, Tex., indie band Spoon. The lovable result is ''Music From the Motion Picture 'Stranger Than Fiction' '' (Sony Music Soundtrax), which includes a short and sharp new Spoon song, ''The Book I Write,'' alongside three old ones and all sorts of Spoonish odds and ends. There are three instrumental pieces by Mr. Daniel and Brian Reitzell, the disc's producer, along with tidy British rock from the Jam (a demo version of ''That's Entertainment''), ricocheting dub reggae from Lee Perry (''Dubbing in the Back Seat,'' by the Upsetters), tangled roots music from Califone, bratty new wave from Delta 5. You can hear Spoon in every song, which is precisely the point: this soundtrack is also the musical portrait of a band.    Tool       In May this great prog-metal band released a weird and immersive new album, ''10,000 Days'' (Tool Dissectional/Volcano/SonyBMG); it sold more than half a million copies in its first week. That was proof that this band has a big and passionate following. But don't be fooled by the absurd packaging (with built-in lenses for the stereoscopic images). This band can still bash out a meaty rock song. Tool's current single, ''The Pot,'' recently topped Billboard's mainstream rock chart; it's the first No. 1 of the band's career. It starts sneakily, with Maynard James Keenan intoning the lyrics (a rant against hypocrisy, or so it seems) over a labyrinthine bass line and some percussion. Eventually the guitar riff arrives, swinging hard and heavy, along with that now-famous refrain: ''You musta been high.'' This is a song meant to be blasted on the radio -- or, if you prefer, buried in the middle of a 76-minute rock epic.    Destroyer       By now anyone who cares has had the better part of a year to digest ''Destroyer's Rubies'' (Merge), the grand and confounding recent album by the ticklish Vancouver singer-songwriter Daniel Bejar, who calls himself Destroyer. With Spencer Krug (from Wolf Parade) and Carey Mercer (Frog Eyes), Mr. Bejar formed Swan Lake; the trio just released its debut album, ''Beast Moans'' (Jagjaguwar). No song on it shows off Mr. Bejar better than ''A Venue Called Rubella,'' which provides a grand and shambling backdrop his petulant daydreams. (''Just another capacity crowd lost at sea,'' he muses, or sneers.) Truly obsessed fans will also want to buy ''We'll Build Them a Golden Bridge'' (Scratch), a new reissue of Mr. Bejar's decade-old debut album. It's not an easy listen, but patience is rewarded by ''Riots,'' a playful but bitter breakup song: ''Your chair is there, your body is on the lam/Until you bring it home, I'm striking up the band/Just so you know, there'll be riots on your hands.'' Finally there's Hello Blue Roses, a new band, in which Mr. Bejar accompanies the singer-songwriter Sydney Vermont; you can visit myspace.com/helloblueroses to hear the ''Hello Blue Roses'' theme song.    Rich Boy       In the last couple of weeks something startling has appeared on television: a great new musical awards show. No, that's not a misprint: MTV2 has been showing a one-hour recap of the first Ozone Awards in Orlando, Fla. The rough-and-tumble ceremony, sponsored by the magazine of the same name, celebrates the best Southern hip-hop; the winners were almost all worthy and often relatively obscure (a double rarity). One who deserved it was Rich Boy, from Mobile, Ala., who received a Patiently Waiting award, given to emerging rappers. He has a contract with Interscope, a smooth but wordy rhyme style and, right now, a regional hit. It's called ''Throw Some D's,'' and you can hear it online (myspace.com/richboy) or maybe, if you live in the Deep South, on the radio. There's a silky beat by Polow da Don, which gives Rich Boy a chance to brag about his Cadillac -- not his last chance, one imagines.

We wish to protest this untimely arrest in the strongest terms.   We understand the outrage Israelis feel at being subjected to indiscriminate attacks on their civilian population by the Iraqis and are dismayed by the expressions of glee displayed by Palestinians in the West Bank and Jordan. But we are also mindful of the injustices that Palestinian residents of the West Bank have had to endure for years. The actions of the Israeli Government against Mr. Nusseibeh, who has been a voice of moderation and reason among the Palestinians, are bound to strengthen others interested in intensifying distrust between Israelis and Palestinians and in frustrating a settlement of the question of Palestine fair to all.   We call upon the Israelis to exercise the admirable restraint and courage they have shown toward Iraqi missile attacks in their treatment of the Palestinians, to adhere to their own best traditions of respect for law and due process and to rescind the charges against Mr. Nusseibeh or, if they feel the charges are justified, to accord him a fair trial.    We urge the United States Government to use its good offices to persuade the Israeli Government not to silence Palestinian leaders who have advocated negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis under conditions of equality and mutual respect.
