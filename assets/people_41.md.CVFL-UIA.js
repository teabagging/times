Yaritza Almedina, 10, ran her fingers along her long pink skirt, delighting in the feel of the fabric. The teacher, Barbara Romero, pulled the string at the waistband as tight as it would go, then turned and helped other girls slip flamenco skirts over their jeans and leggings. She had tucked a pile of the skirts, her own costumes, in her dance bag so her students would have the chance to feel the flow of a pretty skirt as it caught the wind while they danced.\\n\\nAt the back of the stage, Yaritza began twirling, letting the borrowed skirt flutter as she moved. \\"I would like to be a dance teacher when I grow up,\\" she said. \\"I like to do ballet and dance salsa.\\"\\n\\nYaritza is one of two dozen girls and a handful of boys who are a month into their dance class at Munoz Marin. They are a fraction of the hundreds of students who will ultimately take part in the Connecticut Ballet Theater's Dance Exposure Project, a joint effort of the Southport-based Ballet Theater, the Bridgeport school system and Bridgeport area businesses and community service organizations.\\n\\nThe goal is to give elementary school students throughout the city a taste of dance, through in-school and after-school classes and through a performance tour by the company of the Connecticut Ballet Theater. Scholarships to the Ballet Theater school in Southport will be offered to promising students.\\n\\n\\"Dance equals culture and it keeps culture alive,\\" said the director of the Ballet Theater, Brett Raphael. \\"There are 40 languages alone spoken in Bridgeport and dance is a way children can relate on a nonverbal level. It's also a self-esteem builder and if we can interest children who are at-risk early on, we can keep them interested right on up the ladder.\\"\\nThe Call of the Castanets\\n\\n The students, who spend an hour each week learning flamenco dance, are an eager, boisterous group. Ms. Romero, a professional flamenco dancer and dance instructor, drives in from Manhattan to teach the class. \\n\\nAt the start of a recent class, she clacked her castanets and within moments the lines of dancers dissolved, all of them eager to try out the instrument. She gave a quick lesson, slipping into and out of Spanish for the bilingual students. She then tried to corral the group back to some semblance of order and taught a few steps. They danced in a small space, just a curtain's pull away from basketball practice in the adjacent gym as music wafted from a cassette player.\\n\\n\\"I enjoy teaching this class very much,\\" Ms. Romero said. \\"All kids need culture and dance and I like bringing it to them. It's a lot different from teaching a class in a studio and in that way it's much more of a challenge, but I really like it.\\"\\n\\nAs a group of girls practiced swishing their skirts and clapping their hands, admiring each other's moves, the boys said they liked the stomping. \\n\\n\\"You get to stamp your feet loud,\\" Carlos Serrano, 10, said. \\n\\nHis brother, Anthony, 8, decked out in a string tie, stood next to him, raising his arms overhead in a flourish as he strove to learn Ms. Romero's steps. \\n'An Exciting Place'\\n\\n Carlos said his parents liked to turn the radio up on the weekends and dance to Spanish music. \\"We all love to dance,\\" he said, adding that he had taken dance classes before at a local boys' club. \\"I like coming here after school. My Mom works, so at home there'd be nothing for us to do after school except watch TV.\\" \\n\\nThe dance class is just one element of an after-school program for Munoz Marin students sponsored by the McGivney Community Center, which runs youth programs for the neighborhood. \\n\\n\\"These kids have an exciting place to be after school, a vital, interesting, safe place, and the dance program is just another part of the education,\\" said Anthony F. Forni, the center's president. \\n\\nSusan McDonald, a teacher at Munoz Marin and the coordinator of the after-school program, said she had seen children improve in school after having become involved in the dance program.\\n\\n\\"You see it on their faces as they dance,\\" she said. \\"They're so happy and they're so proud. What a wonderful thing that is. And it translates into success in the classroom because they feel that way about themselves.\\" \\n\\nThe school's principal, Milagros Vizcarrondo, said the dance program taught self-discipline and gave students hope for the future.\\n\\n\\"Not every child is going to succeed at math or reading but he may be an artist,\\" she said. \\"We live in a very economically and socially depressed area and this is not something parents can afford to do on their own for their children.\\"\\nCultural Development Is Goal\\n\\n Last year, the Connecticut Ballet Theater created a pilot program in four Bridgeport elementary schools, offering classes in flamenco, African and jazz dance as part of the school curriculum. It has expanded the program to include after-school programs sponsored by several community centers. Corporations and foundations like the Chase Manhattan Bank, the General Electric Foundation, the Bridgeport Futures Initiative and the Fairfield County Community Foundation are providing financial support.\\n\\nBrenda Smith, the president of the Bridgeport Futures Initiative, said one of the organization's goals was to provide children with as much cultural development as possible.\\n\\n\\"Studies have shown that children who engage in artistic as well as cognitive programs when they are young do much better as adults,\\" she said. \\"It's important for children in the inner city, for children in the suburbs and in rural areas as well. They need that opportunity for self-expression.\\"\\n\\nThe coordinator of the Dance Exposure Project and teacher of modern dance with the Connecticut Ballet Theater, Claire Mastromonaco, said that was why the dance theater had created the program. The Ballet Theater started a program in Stamford in 1991 and some of the students there went on to perform in the Ballet Theater's production of \\"The Nutcracker.\\"\\n'A Fundamental Element'\\n\\n \\"Bridgeport has so many resources,\\" Ms. Mastromonaco said. \\"The teachers in the schools, the people in the community want so much for their children, I've really seen that through this dance program. It just needs to be more united to get things done and I think that is happening here. The arts are a fundamental element to life and I think people are starting to see that. \\n\\n\\"We've seen it in the kids,\\" she said. \\"The teachers say their energy level is more even during the school day. Learning to read and do math is so important, but through the arts you get to know yourself.\\"\\n\\nAs the end of the class at Munoz Marin neared, Yaritza showed a series of steps to her younger sister, Marie, 8. \\"This way,\\" she said, with confidence. Her sister then followed her steps.

G. W. Pabst, who has several worthy films to his credit, is responsible for the direction of this offering, the story of which can be summed up as one wherein people who dwell in glass houses regret in the end that they have thrown stones.To aid in understanding the action of this production, the management of the theatre has had a synopsis of the tale printed in the program. Nevertheless, it is really a production that can be enjoyed far more by those with a knowledge of the Teutonic tongue.Fraulein Henny Porten, who recently played a dual rôle in \\"Gretel und Liesel,\\" impersonates Eva, a cheery young school teacher who adopts a little boy. The village folk and those connected with her school are amazed one day when the child runs up to Eva and calls her \\"mother.\\"Soon the gossipers are busy and Eva's dismissal from the school is demanded. Everybody appears to be frightfully worried about the child except Eva. The scandal whisperers bring about an investigation of Eva's conduct, which appears at first to be welcomed by the principal of the school and one or two of the teachers. But subsequently they are led to understand that all those connected with the school are to be interrogated concerning their own private lives, and one after another they visit Eva and plead with her to resign.The climax comes when Kurt, the minister of education, who is engaged to marry Eva, discovers that the child who has caused all the fuss, is none other than his own. By that time the hypocrites have learned their lesson and all is well with Eva, Kurt and the youngster.Oscar Sigma gives a facile performance as Kurt. Ludwig Stoessel is excellent as the school principal. Fraulein Porten is charming, and in the course of her portrayal she sings several ballads.

A1    Jordanian security officials announced the arrest of an Iraqi woman closely linked to the terrorist leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as a fourth bomber in the Amman hotel attacks. They also broadcast a taped confession showing her wearing a translucent suicide explosive belt packed with ball bearings and describing how she had tried unsuccessfully to blow herself up.   A1    Iraq Projects Moving Forward  The American official in charge of reconstruction in Iraq said that American-financed projects were moving forward, but that officials had not publicized them to avoid putting Iraqi workers at risk. The American military also cast doubts on a claim posted on a Baath Party Web site that Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, the last of Saddam Hussein's inner circle still at large, had died.   A4    Ethiopian Capital Turns Bloody  After a months-long political standoff that has turned increasingly bloody, Addis Ababa has become the latest continental crisis point to attract the attention of the African Union. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, formerly hailed as one of Africa's new generation of leaders, now finds himself criticized as a dictator.   A6    Spain Orders Inquiry Into C.I.A.  An investigative judge in Palma has ordered a police inquiry to be sent to Spain's national court, to consider whether the C.I.A. was routing planes carrying terrorism suspects through the Spanish island of Mallorca as part of its so-called rendition program.   A8    Rice Seeks Progress in Mideast  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, making her fourth visit to Israel this year, again implored Israelis and Palestinians to resolve their differences, amid mounting signs of frustration in Washington over the lack of progress since Israel withdrew from Gaza in the summer.   A3    India Arrests Bombing Suspect  The Indian police have arrested a suspected ringleader in the synchronized bomb blasts that struck New Delhi late last month and left at least 60 people dead. The police say the suspect has links to a Pakistan-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba.   A13    Former Kazakh Minister Killed  A former minister in the government of President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev who had said he would speak publicly about high-level corruption was found shot to death three weeks before a presidential election in Kazakhstan, an oil-rich former Soviet state.   A10    NATIONAL   A14-18    Private Group Plays Role Backing Bush Court Pick  Progress for America, which describes itself as an independent grass roots organization, but functions like an unofficial extension of the White House, has forged an unusual role for itself as an unwavering ally on just about every issue: Supreme Court nominations, tax cuts, terrorism and changes to the tort law and Social Security systems.   A1    Nominee's Critics Shift Focus  Seeking to move beyond an initial focus on abortion rights, a coalition of liberal groups opposing the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. is preparing a national television advertising campaign accusing him of threatening rights in other areas, from police searches to employment discrimination.   A1    College Presidents Earn More  For the first time, a survey reported private school presidents earning $1 million in a single year. The report serves as the latest reminder that effective college presidents are a hot commodity and that college boards are going to unusual lengths to recruit and retain them.   A14    New Mercury Emission Plan  Concerned that new federal standards on mercury emissions will not produce more immediate health benefits, two national groups of state and local air quality regulators have developed a plan to yield fewer emissions in less time.   A17    Drop in Foreign Students Slows  The number of foreign students enrolled in American universities declined slightly in the 2004-2005 academic year, according to a new survey, suggesting that a more significant drop that took place in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, might be abating.   A16    Bush Blamed for Election Loss  Douglas R. Forrester, a Republican, lost by a wide margin to Senator Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat, in the New Jersey governor's election. The chief reason, Mr. Forrester said in The Star-Ledger of Newark, is that he belongs to the same party as President Bush.   A16    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    New York Republicans Divided From Within  The state Republican Party is beset by ideological divisions, personal rivalries and individual agendas that are undermining any semblance of party unity as the 2006 elections approach, many party officials say.   B1    Clintons Visit Jordan  Former President Bill Clinton, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, paid an unannounced visit to Jordan on the second day of their tour of the Middle East to see the damage caused by last week's suicide bombings.

Yet, American industry finds it increasingly difficult to compete and productivity lags well behind that of foreign competition. American management blames this on many factors, especially labor. However, management should note that when armies do battle and the better-equipped force loses, the fault lies not with the soldiers, but with the generals.   The top management in America, with many notable exceptions, is sadly lacking in knowledge and leadership. The reason for this is that corporate directors generally do not have an independent attitude toward the companies they supposedly steward. Many on the board, including the so-called independents, are much more concerned with perserving management's entrenched position than with promoting the interests of shareholders. In many instances, the chief executive officer is not chosen because he is the most capable man available for the job, but, generally, because he is liked by the outgoing chief executive. The reason this system has been allowed to flourish - despite the below par management it creates - is because the boards of directors and the C.E.O.'s of publicly held American companies are for the most part answerable to no one.
