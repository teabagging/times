That adds up to more than 75 million voters, consumers and employees (boomers make up more than a third of the nation's population of approximately 250 million). The impact of this demographic milestone has been much explored in economic and social terms. But its effects on culture promise to be no less momentous. Could classical music's popularity suddenly soar, as millions of baby boomers finally admit that they don't feel angry enough for rock anymore? Will this notoriously self-absorbed generation remain smitten with its lost youth, as evidenced in the pop music, movies and television shows it favors, or will it confront society's conflicting attitudes toward aging? Perhaps we'll see more starring film roles for performers over 50, in tales of love and other new-found happiness among the middle-aged. (Maybe Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood in \\"The  Bridges of Madison County\\" were only the beginning.)

Or a change in  taste, without diminishing the respectability of Thackeray or William Dean Howells, deprives them of readers. Conversely, just such a change may bring Trollope back into fashion and cause forgotten novels and new biographies to be  published posthaste, as though news of Tolstoy's dictum -- that this was among the greatest of English novelists -- had just been received by the general public. Sometimes an entire genre (19th-century epic poetry) goes into eclipse while another is rediscovered (English metaphysical poetry) or a work later recognized as a masterpiece so offends the current critical canon that for a time it stops an author's career dead in its tracks. Such was the effect of \\"Moby-Dick\\" on Melville.         But individualized rotten luck, more like the bite of a snake in the grass than a majestic revolution of the wheel of fortune, also preys on writers: tuberculosis or insanity; blindness; drug or alcohol addiction. There may be ostracism, or worse, on account of political views or activities that may be extraneous to the work or central, may be noble or despicable.

Is it possible to grow an oleander indoors in New York City? And if so, where can I purchase one?    A.  While oleanders (Nerium oleander) grow wild in tropical and subtropical climates, the problem you might face in growing one indoors is providing full sun and the right temperature in winter. Oleanders prefer a winter temperature of around 40","excerpt":"at normal room temperatures, they tend to get restless instead of resting, resulting in lanky growth. In summer, oleanders really prefer to be outdoors where it is hot and sunny, but a sunny apartment should do.

When they are actively growing, oleanders seem to be made for gardeners who typically kill through love. Don't feel like watering, or forget to water? Frequent and copious are its favorite adjectives, but oleanders tolerate drought when they have to. Forget to empty excess water from the saucers? They can handle it until you remember.

By the fourth quarter of last year, the company's earnings plunged 42 percent from their level a year earlier and earnings for the entire year dropped to their lowest level since 1983.   But PPG's fortunes seem to have shifted, several industry analysts say, contending that the company already absorbed the biggest blow from the recession, in the last three months of 1991. In part, the improvement is the result of greater efficiency and the closing of high-cost operations, notably in glass making. But the greatest benefit has come from the slow, but steady improvement in the economy, which has increased the demand for automobiles, houses and office buildings that use the company's glass for windows.

And their anticipations are fulfilled.There is nothing particularly Scandinavian in this merry account of the transformation of a sleepy employment agency into an up-and-coming supplier of help of all kinds through the enterprise of a penniless chap with plenty of nerve (Nils Lundell). But the complications are amusing, and Birgit Rosengren is charming as the \\"No. 7\\" who finally is sent home, not to joblessness but as the bride of a likely young dentist (Bengt Djurberg). So nobody need object to the lack of originality.This Europa Film production was directed by Dideon Wahlberg. There are English titles.

Judging from recent reports from King Gustaf's kingdom, there are few there who fail to agree with the former pacifist (Thor Modeen) when he tells the world that Sweden's freedom and institutions are well worth defending, by force of arms if necessary.Nevertheless, the film is far from being militaristic and all concerned have a good time, even during manoeuvres. Rut Holm and Aake Soderblöm supply most of the comedy. Prominent in the cast are the comely Karin Ekelund and Inga-Bodil Vetterlund, and the likely Fritiof Billquist and Karl-Arne Holmsten. Ragnar Arvedson directed the picture for the Europa company. There are English titles.

With two such popular funny people as Edvard Persson and Rut Holm at his disposal it was easy for Director Emil A. Pehrsson to turn out a pleasant little production for the Europa concern.The story is simple enough. When Persson loses his job in a bank because he is covering up an ill fellow-worker who has appropriated 5,000 kroner, he treks across country to a village where an old friend (Arthur Fischer) is Mayor and is put to work as an extra policeman. But after a few days his rather unworthy son (Holger Winge) arrives there as the suitor of the Mayor's lovely daughter (Anna-Lisa Ericson). So does his faithful housekeeper (Rut).Before the expected ending there are plenty of amusing situations, but nothing startling, which is all right under the circumstances. There are English titles.

For while \\"Familjen Andersson\\" (The Andersson Family), the current importation from Stockholm, emphasizes the saying that pride goes before a fall, its serious moments are very few and its merry complications are many.That excellent actor, Sigurd Wallen, directed and played the leading part in this Svensk Talfilm production. As the plain, sensible middleaged owner of a prosperous laundry unimpressed by the social climbing activities of his generally attractive spouse (Elsa Carlsson), Herr Wallen wins the spectators at once and holds their sympathetic interest until he succeeds in convincing her that the society game isn't worth the candle.Pretty Inga-Bodil Vetterlund does well as the couple's daughter and Allan Bohlin and Bjoern Berglund are competent as rivals for her hand. Hilda Borgstroem, long a prominent fixture of the Swedish stage, lends distinction to the minor role of the laundry owner's mother. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 48th Street Theatre"},{"year":"1939","title":"Although King Gustaf V is not listed in the cast of \\"Med Folket För Fosterlandet,\\" the Swedish \\"Cavalcade,\\" now at the Forty-eighth Street Theatre, he shares the honors of this well-made and highly interesting picture with Sigurd Wallen, personification of the hard-headed and tender-hearted Swedish worker, and Gösta Cederlund, exemplification of the enterprising but reasonable Swedish middle-class. The sons and daughters of Sverige living in New York may well be proud of this film account of the progress of their native land, and Americans can learn something by seeing it.Beginning with the death of Oscar II on Dec. 8, 1907, the scenario shows the development of Sweden through thirty-one years into an outstanding example of industrial and political democracy won by means of cooperation between employers and workers, with the aid of a King gifted with common sense and love for his people. Not that everything always moved smoothly. For instance, in 1909, we see a young labor leader, Per Albin Hansson, addressing a crowd of defeated strikers and telling them that they are bound to win in the long run. Then, in 1920, one hears a couple of citizens making wisecracks as to what kind of a Minister of War Per Albin is going to be. And still later and at the end of the picture Per Albin is shown as the efficient Socialist Prime Minister, popular with almost everybody.Actual news reels, cleverly mixed with the imaginary happenings in two typical families, give an air of reality rarely encountered on the screen. Mechanical and artistic advances are brought out by numerous striking and sometimes amusing incidents. A review of Greta Garbo's debut in Stockholm is quoted as labeling this young player as \\"an unbaked bun,\\" not likely ever to amount to anything. With characteristic honesty, the producers include the big blot on Sweden's financial record—the Ivar Kreuger episode—in their catalogue of historical events. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 48th Street Theatre"},{"year":"1940","title":"At last Argentina's film makers have got around to paying their tribute to the George Washington of their country—General José de San Martin. And, considering technical limitations, they have done well. In these days of dictators of all kinds, \\"Nuestra Tierra de Paz\\" (Our Land of Peace), now at the Forty-eighth Street Theatre, is calculated to strengthen one's faith in democracy, even though civil strife caused San Martin to leave the nation he had led to freedom from Spanish rule, and die in poverty in Boulogne in 1850 at the age of 72.Persons familiar with the details of the liberator's character may, or may not, regard Pedro Tocci as rather too calm under all circumstances of war, politics and love. On the whole, however, he brings out the nobility of the man who resigned his officer's post in the Spanish Army in 1811 to fight single-heartedly, with no lust for personal glory, for the freedom of South America.Arturo S. Mom, who directed the picture for Henri Martinet, held closely to the historical record of San Martin's career, although an extra-marital romance is hinted at by the delightful presence of Emperatriz Carvajal, as a patriotic girl of the people. Elsa Martinez is charming in the double role of San Martin's wife and daughter. The great Bolivar (Enrique de Angelis) appears briefly on the occasion of the meeting of the two liberators in Peru in 1822.At the 86th Street CasinoLittle Walter Schuller is such an appealing 4-year-old in \\"Hurra! Ich bin Papa!\\" (Hurrah! I'm a Papa!), the Cina-Allianz comedy romance, directed by Kurt Hoffmann, now at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre, that it is not too hard to believe that even such a gay young man as Heinz Ruehmann could settle down to business for his sake—particularly when the girl-mother is played by the always attractive Carola Hoehn.Albert Florath is excellent as the rich father willing to use any device to win his son away from his sporty companions. Others in this mildly entertaining piece are Ursula Grabley, Hansi Arnstaedt and Olga Limburg.

The story of Sweden's own eighteenth-century version of Robin Hood, who steals gayly right and left only to bestow his loot upon the poor, it has the unhurried pastoral leisure that is sometimes refreshing in contrast with Hollywood's hectic pace. Its drama and its humor are simple, sturdy and not too deft—either in script or execution—but, as usual in Swedish films, it lingers often and long on landscapes, clouds and cows. It has the further advantage of the presence of Liane Linden, as fresh and comely a young actress as we've seen for a long time. Sture Lagerwall plays the role of the hero thief with occasional effectiveness. But it is Miss Linden and the landscapes that are the picture's virtues. Distinctly for simple tastes.

Against all sorts of odds, it was finished and slipped out of the country one jump ahead of the Nazis. And that, we regret to report, is the most dramatic thing about it. For, as much as one would like to hail it as a farewell triumph, the blunt and unpleasant fact is that \\"Two Women,\\" like the last few leaves which drop from a tree at year's end, is a flimsy and dismal affair.Apparently its director, Leonide Moguy, was so impressed with the Goncourt Prize novel, \\"L'Empreinte du Dieu,\\" from which it was taken, that he could not leave anything out of his film. And the consequence is a painfully long and confused screen story about two women, devoted friends, who love the same man. The scene is laid in Flanders, along the French-Belgian border, and there are some interesting glimpses of that country, some intriguing suggestions of the smuggling which used to go on there. But the emotional involutions of the characters are so tediously elaborated, the performances of the actors are so pretentious and the structure so haphazard that the whole thing turns out a botch. \\"Two Women\\" is a feeble, pathetic shadow of the French film at its best.

The slender story rests upon a case of mistaken identity. Karl's fellow stagehands present his friend to the members of a singing society as an opera star incognito, and from then on it is merely a question of just how Karl will be enabled to make good his pals' bluff. In working out the sequence the director has given the audience many pleasing songs, including a couple of operatic numbers, and several amusing incidents. All the actors are effective.

Eager for adventure, Herr Kobin quickly makes the acquaintance of a high-class crook (Walter Steinbeck), and finds plenty of what he is looking for during a stopover in Prague.Despite the obvious nature of the happenings, the good acting of the principals and their supporters manages to hold the spectators' attention until the expected happy ending.

She has been chosen for the leading part in a solemn festival play by the serious young director (Rolf Wanke), a member of the local aristocracy. The rehearsals are going along well, as is the incipient love between the director and the leading lady, when everything is thrown into confusion and misunderstanding by the arrival in town of a starving young artist (Walter Ladengast), who has walked all the way from Munich to show his sketches to the director. Pity for his plight leads the appealing foolish virgin into serious indiscretions, which keep the audience guessing for some time.Miss Hardt's support is first rate and the photography is excellent, but the sound reproduction is disappointing. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 79th Street Theatre."},{"year":"1936","title":"A different and worthwhile German-language film is now at the Seventy-ninth Street Theatre carrying the title of \\"Der Klosterjaeger\\" (The Monastery's Hunter). Based on a popular Austrian novel of a generation ago, this remarkably well photographed mountain romance of the Middle Ages holds the spectators' interest largely through its lovely and striking views of the Bavarian Alps.It seems that back in the days of cross-bows and great temporal power in the hands of the church, a wise and mild prelate ruled over the region of Berchtesgaden, tempering with mercy the harsh edicts of his cranky overseer and lightening the burdens of the hard-driven peasants. Came one day a new hunter, charged with providing the monastery with game and chasing away poachers. Quickly he fell in love with the blonde sister of a poor peasant, forced to become a poacher for a night in order to pay his land tithes and get aid for his sick child.And then the action runs along just as in a modern movie and everybody knows in a general way what is bound to happen. But it must be admitted that there are a few unusual incidents, including a highly realistic fight with a bear, before the secret of the heroine's noble birth is revealed and all ends well, with only one casualty.Although Charlotte Radspieler, a newcomer to the Yorkville screen, appears rather too timid and graceful for a peasant girl of those distant times, she has considerable charm. Friedrich Ulmer is first-rate as the churchman and the other actors do well. The tempo is rather deliberate, perhaps in the mood of the epoch, and the last few hundred meters of celluloid are unnecessary.

Laughed at and misunderstood by his superiors, his own parents and those of his fiancée, he resigns his commission to give all his time to his chosen work. Naturally, he undergoes all sorts of hardships and overcomes many obstacles before making good.Leny Marenbach is at her charming best as the girl who sticks by the enthusiast through thick and thin, while Brigitte Horney is as alluring as ever in the role of an actress determined to prevent her boy friend (Werner Futterer) from continuing to risk his life in the air. There are several other excellent actors in the cast.This instructive and diverting picture was directed by Wolfgang Liebeneiner for the Terra Company.At the 86th Street CasinoAnton Kutter, director of \\"Die Weisse Majestät\\" (White Majesty), the Bavaria's gripping mountain-climbing film now at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre, was hardly fair to Hertha Thiele and Gustav Diessl in pitting them against the awesome background of the Alps.Just the same, Herr Diessl, in the role of a dour young guide under suspicion by the villagers of not being entitled to his bit of land and of having killed a judge, captures the sympathies and admiration of the audience with his fine acting and his scaling of a hitherto unconquered peak. How the credit is to be divided between his reputed prowess and the trick photography is a technical problem.Unfortunately for Miss Thiele, the unforgettable Manuela in \\"Mädchen in Uniform,\\" only once since that picture was made, back in 1931, has she had a real chance to show her ability and that was in \\"Anna und Elisabeth,\\" shown here three years ago. While her innocent, child-like charm is in evidence as the sweetheart of the daring guide, she has little occasion to do much acting and scarcely avails herself of that.The setting is magnificent and the supporting cast is first-rate. Although \\"Die Weisse Majestät\\" was made more than five years ago, its technique leaves nothing to be desired.

The few historical slips and anachronisms are of slight importance, weighed against the all-around merit of the production, some of which was \\"shot\\" in California under Trenker's supervision. Although the sterling actor from Southern Tyrol plays the leading part himself and is the center of the action, the other members of a large and capable cast receive plenty of opportunity to shine.

For the pretty blonde, Irene Zilahy (who was acclaimed a few years ago by Viennese art students as their ideal of a music hall artist) certainly has a hectic time on the first anniversary of her (screen) wedding to Max Hansen, the popular Danish-German comedian.Dolly acquires a slight case of intoxication while sampling the drinks laid out for a feast planned for a crowd of relatives who fail to arrive on time. When she hears of the delay she is determined to make the rounds of the night clubs, which forces her lawyer-husband to follow her through a highly amusing series of adventures, involving the robbing of his own home by a band of crooks. The pace is fast and the accompanying music is catchy.

Rosay's representation of that strange mixture of hysterical, selfish maternal love and avarice which was the mother-in-law in the famous nineteenth century Belgian writer's story, is so masterful that even such excellent actors as Matthias Wiemann and Algels Salloker are reduced to second and third place in the interest of the audience. Naturally, the author and Karl Ritter, who directed the picture for the UFA, also helped to make her the central figure of this domestic near-tragedy, somewhat lightened by Carsta Löck's good comedv work.The settings, in an inn and a physician's home in the Flanders of the Eighteen Sixties, are practically perfect and the atmosphere seems realistic.At the Teatro LatinoVisitors to the Teatro Latino will get a pretty good idea of the miserable life of the great mass of Mexican Indians in the \\"bad old days\\" of Dictator Porfirio Diaz by watching the unrolling of the simple plot of \\"El Indio,\\" an importation from below the Rio Grande directed by Armando Vargas de la Maza for the Nuestro Mexico Company. Also they will take part vicariously in several interesting fiestas.For the makers of this indictment of the oppressors of the peones have injected enough humor and music into the action to relieve the tenseness of the celluloid atmosphere. Unfortunately, the mechanical side of the picture is not up to the high standard set by the actors.Pedro Armendariz is fine as the youth who prefers hunting to slaving with the other peones on the sugar plantation of a nasty Spanish hacendado (Eduardo Vivas), while the lovely Consuelo Frank is charming as his sweetheart, although it must be noted that she is hardly of the Indian type. Carlos Lopez (\\"El Chaflan\\"), who is making a personal appearance at the Teatro Latino this week, is funny and pathetic at the same time in the role of a house servant whose heart is with his fellow Indians, but whose fear of the bosses generally controls his deeds.At the 86th Street CasinoThere is one good and sufficient reason for seeing \\"Männer Müssen So Sein\\" (Men Are That Way), the new German film at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre. Said reason is the charming brunette Hertha Feiler in the role of a Hamburg girl who runs away from home to become a dancer and winds up by dominating a cage of tigers and belatedly winning the heart of a thoughtless, but likable, animal trainer (Hans Soehnker).In fact, Miss Feiler is so attractive right in the first reel, when she has a brief affair with the trainer in a park and has changed so little when they meet a few years later that it is hard to believe that even a circus Don Juan could have forgotten her and need to become acquainted all over again. But the responsibility for this situation must be put up to Arthur Maria Rabenalt who directed this smoothly running picture for the Terra company.Among the prominent actors in the big cast are Hans Olden as the evil fancy marksman with designs upon Hertha, and Paul Hoerbiger in the part of a clown, whose late wife was one of the sharpshooter's early victims. The plot involves the tigers more than is usual in similar productions. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th St. Garden Theatre"},{"year":"1939","title":"Smoothly directed by V. Tourjansky for the Terra Company, \\"Der Gouverneur,\\" the first new German film of the season to be shown at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre, is a glorification of militarism.After Willy Birgel, as the efficient general of the armed forces of an unidentified European country, has dissolved its Parliament, with the consent of the prince, because the civilian authorities are incompetent to deal with the disturbing conditions on the border and the threat of a general strike, a \\"radical\\" deputy (Walter Franck) is murdered.Circumstantial evidence indicates a fine young lieutenant (Ernst von Klipstein) of the general's own 300-year-old regiment as the slayer. Of course, he has an alibi, but its use would wreck the governor-general's happy home. Then Herr Birgel dramatically declares that the honor of the regiment ranks higher than his own because, if the people lose faith in the army, they may think its officers no better than the civilians they have displaced. Naturally, the scenarist finds a way out of this dilemma. The general keeps his alluring wife (Brigitte Horney) and presumably continues to rule as a benevolent dictator.Hannelore Schroth, the young daughter of Kaete Haack and Heinrich Schroth, is highly attractive in a secondary role. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th St. Garden Theatre"},{"year":"1940","title":"Using an all-star cast, Erich Engels has directed for the Czerny Company of Berlin a first-rate burlesque of the \\"mystery-jewel-robbery-musical-romance\\" so popular with movie-makers. This amusing film is \\"Peter, Paul und Nanette\\" and may be seen at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre.Hermann Thimig, the most important member of the \\"Austrian Barrymore Family,\\" has the double role of a shy jewelry salesman, in love with the charming blonde daughter (Hilde Krüger) of his boss (Hans Junkermann), and of a notorious thief who looks just like him. Others in leading parts are Paul Heidemann, Olga Limburg, Hilde Hildebrand, Paul Henckels, Hans Richter and Jakob Tiedtke, Paula Denk, a slender brunette, is especially attractive as a pert maid. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th St. Garden Theatre"},{"year":"1939","title":"Much of the air of reckless gayety and political intrigue that pervaded the capital of Austria-Hungary on the eve of the World War has been re-created in celluloid by the UFA in \\"Hotel Sacher,\\" the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre's last new picture of the 1938-39 season. The film may be labeled a forewarning of the end of the great days of the famous Vienna hotel, because although Frau Anna Sacher (well played by Hedwig Bleibtreu) continued to preside over the institution until her death in 1930, its post-war existence was but a pale reflection of its ancient glory.With the aid of a first-class cast headed by Willy Birgel as an up-right Austrian officer of Ruthenian origin and the alluring Sybille Schmitz as a \\"fellow-Slav\\" trying to win him for the cause of Greater Russia, Director Erich Engel has turned out an interesting and entertaining production. While the general ending is obvious from the start, nobody can tell how many lives are to be snuffed out before the cold gray dawn of Jan. 1, 1914, sees the end of the New Year revelry and tragedy.There are striking scenes at the opera and at the various functions in the hotel. Prominent among the actors are Wolf Albach-Retty, Herbert Hübner, Leo Peukert, Elfie Mayerhofer, Karl Stepanek and Olly Holzmann. There are English titles.At the 86th Street CasinoFurther proof, if anything like that is needed any more, that suspense may be dispensed with entirely in a comedy romance with no dimunition of the film's laugh-provoking qualities, is being presented at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre in the shape of \\"Verliebte Herzen\\" (Hearts in Love). From the moment Paul Hörbiger and Karin Hardt, and Rolf Wanka and Hella Pitt appear on the screen the spectators know the answer to the merry mix-up of identities, but that doesn't prevent them from enjoying the clever ins and cuts of the \\"plot\\" and the occasional bits of genuine satire.Charming little Karin, as the supposed servant girl whom \\"Doctor\\" Hörbiger plans to educate preliminary to marrying her, shows that she is just as good in comedy parts as in her usual serious roles. Fräulein Pitt is a welcome newcomer to Yorkville. Rudolf Karl makes an amusing putative father, while Pepi-Glöckner-Kramer is fine as the doctor's middle-aged house-keeper. Of course, Herren Hörbiger and Wanka are excellent. This Elektra production was directed by Carl Boese at a rather fast pace.At the Teatro LatinoAgain a Mexican film concern—this time the D. O. S. A.—uses a whole galaxy of stars, including the three Soleres (Domingo, Fernando and Julian), Sara Garcia, Don Catarino, pretty Señorita Carmelita and an able half-grown boy named Guillermo Cantu, for the purpose of letting Director José Bohr grind out just another run-of-the-mine comedy. The name of this rather ancient picture, now at the Teatro Latino, is \\"Por Mis Pistolas\\" (By My Pistols), which is also the title of what might be called its theme song. There are several funny incidents in this sketch of small-town and rural life which ends with three marriages, so it will do as hot weather fare.MUSIC NOTESThe second of the two British concerts by the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra, given under the auspices of the British Council as part of the World's Fair music festivities, is scheduled for tonight at 8:45 o'clock at Carnegie Hall. Sir Adrain Boult will conduct. On the program will be Vaughan Williams's \\"Five Variants on 'Dives and Lazarus,'\\" and Arthur Bliss's piano concerto, with Solomon as soloist, both of which works will receive their world premières.The La Follette School of Music will give its fourteenth semi-annual students' recital tonight in Steinway Hall. The proceeds will go to the school's scholarship fund.The Choral Society of the League for Labor Palestine presents its annual concert tomorrow at 8:30 P. M., at the Hotel Pennsylvania. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th St. Garden Theatre At the 86th Street Casino At the Teatro Latino MUSIC NOTES"},{"year":"1939","title":"Once more the quarrels, loves and music of the Strauss family have served as material for a delightful méelange of waltzes, marches and sad and comic incidents, with a charming early nineteenth century background. This new Tobis production, directed by E. W. Emo, was made in Vienna, with the effective cooperation of the famous Philharmonic Orchestra of the former Austrian capital.Called \\"Unsterblicher Walzer\\" (Immortal Waltz), the picture at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre presents many of the most popular compositions of Johann Sr. and of his three sons, most of them in gay ballroom settings. Paul Hoerbiger is excellent as Strauss the elder, and Fred Liewehr, Hans Holt and Fritz Lehmann are competent in the roles of Johann Jr., Joseph and Eduard, respectively. The female characters are well done by Friedl Czepa, Maria Andergast and Gretl Theimer.At the Modern PlayhouseThe chief virtue of \\"Varju a Toronyoran\\" (Crow on the Tower), the current attraction at the Modern Playhouse, is its presentation of several new Magyar actors for the approval of Yorkville audiences. Erzebet Simor, a vivacious brunette, uses a pair of flashing black eyes so effectively that her ensnaring of a rich, middle-aged man (Gabor Rajnay) and his handsome young son (Laszlo Ungvary) seems quite credible. Gyula Benko, a likely youth, also falls victim to her wiles.In view of the fact that the wealthy estate owner has a supposedly dead wife (Emmy Kosary, a Hungarian actress) living in Paris and that his son is engaged to Erzsebet's pretty blond sister (Maria Egry), the possible complications may easily be imagined. Before they are straightened out the veteran Piri Vasszary, as the girl's aunt, has plenty of occasion to chatter like a crow on a clock tower. A. Endre Rodrigusz directed this Atlair Film production smoothly enough.At the 86th Street CasinoFor ones Joe Stoeckel, the Bavarian comedian, plays second fiddle in a swift-moving romantic comedy with most of its action in his own country. Herr Stoeckel is a chief forester in a little village where the pretty and likable Ursula Grabley is \\"hidingout\\" while hoping that Harold Paulsen, her favorite suitor, will find her first, thus beating his rival, Franz Schafheitlin, and showing how easily a newspaper man can outsmart a lawyer.From the name of this Bavaria-Film production, \\"1A in Oberbayern\\" (1A in Upper Bavaria), the \\"1A\\" being a Berlin automobile license number, it is apparent that much of the fun has to do with contrasts between the city visitors and the natives. Just to add to the confusion the rich girl from Berlin gets herself temporarily \\"engaged\\" to a young assistant forester (Georg Bauer), to the passing grief of his real sweetheart (Bertl Aldinger). Director Franz Seitz stirs this dish of humor and slapstick stuff to the obvious amusement of the audiences at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre.At the 48th Street TheatreThe new Mexican film at the Forty-eighth Street Theatre, \\"Papacito Lindo\\" (Sugar Daddy), is a fairly well-made, rather routine picture, which might have been turned out north of the Rio Grande, so far as atmosphere is concerned. Perhaps the lack of anything distinctly Mexican derives from the fact that this Fernando de Fuentes production is based on a French comedy.Nevertheless, it is worth seeing because of the presence of Manolita Zaval, a rising star in the Mexican film firmament. The whole cast acts well, particularly Fernando Soler, as the wealthy middle-aged bachelor in the title role, and the veteran Sara Garcia, as the widowed mother of Manolita, who is rejuvinated by a fling in the movie world of the capital. Julian Soler is the nephew of Fernando, whose love for Manolita overcomes all sorts of obstacles. Director Fuentes could have shortened the dialogue to the advantage of the audience. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th St. Garden Theatre At the Modern Playhouse At the 86th Street Casino At the 48th Street Theatre"},{"year":"1936","title":"Perhaps just to show that the Vienna film-makers, now competing seriously with Berlin for the world trade in German-language pictures, can vary the happy endings of such productions, Liane Haid fails to hold her man in \\"Tanzmusik,\\" the current attraction at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre. This is the first time, at least in the experience of this reviewer, that anything like that has happened to the charming Austrian actress.Another explanation may be that the director is anxious to demonstrate the superiority of mind over matter. Gusti Huber, the young actress playing the part of a rich Viennese girl, who wins Hermann Thimig away from his wealthy \\"American\\" bride, isn't much to look at compared with the fair Liane. Nevertheless, she apparently is just the inspiration the ex-jazz musician needs to make him a success as a Beethoven pianist.So everybody is cheerful in the last reel, especially Georg Alexander in the rôle of an American admirer of Liane, who now sees his chances brighter, and Leo Slezak, proud of the fact that he sponsored the classical concert.Well photographed, played in the right note of gayety throughout by a first-rate cast and spiced with pleasant music, \\"Tanzmusik\\" is consistently entertaining. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th Street Casino"},{"year":"1936","title":"The current comedy at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre offers nothing especially new in complications. It is the story of a stalwart, true-hearted journeyman who marries the personable daughter of the boss right after the last flicker on the screen and presumably is made a partner of a big shoe manufacturer because of his inventive talent.As the picture moves along, the secret of who stole the silver spoon is closely guarded. For the alleged theft the boss has to appear in court, and there is great confusion until the climactic moment.Paul Beckers is excellent in the title rôle of \\"Der Wackere Schustermeister\\" (\\"The Honest Master Shoemaker\\"). His assumed deliberation of speech contrasts sharply with the volubility of Mrs. Fenchel, his accuser. Even high school students of German should be able to understand him without difficulty. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th Street Casino"},{"year":"1937","title":"For the third time within a few months Franz Liszt has supplied the foundation for pleasant musical films submitted to New York audiences. In \\"Wenn die Musik nicht waer'\\" (If It \\"Were Not for Music), now at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre, an interesting and amusing scenario has been built around the way Florian Mayr, a favorite Liszt pupil, is alleged to have found a charming, non-musical wife.Paul Hoerbiger is as effective as always in the rôle of the bashful Mayr, who almost falls victim to the wiles of the alluring Sybille Schmitz before his one-time pupil (the appealing little Karin Hardt) lands him, with the benevolent aid of Abbé Liszt himself. Luis Rainer (not to be confused with Hollywood's Luise) plays Liszt in the traditional manner.There is some fine piano playing, with special attention to the \\"Second Hungarian Rhapsody.\\" More music and less dialogue would have improved the picture, however. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th Street Casino"},{"year":"1937","title":"Slapstick comedy and Hans Moser's sometimes amusing dialect and mannerisms are the main ingredients of \\"A Hoax,\\" the current film at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre. The hardly original idea consists in having Paul Hoerbiger advance from the job of head-waiter in a hotel to the position of its general manager and husband of Eva, the attractive widow who owns it, subject to a heavy mortgage. This happy end is achieved by having a near-by sanitarium burn down and its proprietor hire the empty hotel for his supposedly crazy patients. With the help of this windfall and a $10,000 check from an American guest the head-waiter solves Eva's financial troubles and gets his reward. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th Street Casino"},{"year":"1938","title":"The Central offered another twin bill yesterday, Columbia's \\"Outlaws of the Prairie\\" and Universal's \\"Behind the Mike.\\" In the former Charles Starrett and his singing Texas Rangers break up the robber band led by an ostensibly respectable mine boss. In the latter William Gargan takes over a rickety small-town radio station and uses it to expose the sinister link between the Mayor and the owner of the rival broadcasting studio. Two pictures, two hours, too bad.At the 86th Street CasinoSuse Graf, one of the younger generation of German film actors whose \\"it\\" qualities were noted by Yorkville audiences when her charming shadow was shown there a couple of times in 1936 and 1937, is the principal excuse for \\"Wenn Du eine Schwiegermutter hast\\" (When You Have a Mother-in-Law), now at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre. As the young wife of middle-aged Ralph Arthur Roberts and the daughter of the elderly but always vivacious Ida Wuest, Miss Graf has no trouble in making the spectators believe that she is eagerly sought after by men of all ages at the beach resort where most of the action of this routine comedy of matrimonial errors takes place.This Amalfi-Tonfilm production was directed by Joe Stoeckel, the popular comedian. He keeps a highly capable cast moving pretty fast through lots of funny complications, but even at that the picture seems rather long. Much of the entertainment springs from the plight of Herr Roberts when he is forced to pose as his wife's father in order to further his mother-in-law's clever schemes. Other prominent players are Mady Rahl, Ernst Dumcke, Erwin Biegel and Kurt Vespermann.At the 86th St. Garden TheatreAccording to European newspapers, Zarah Leander, the stately Swedish actress who takes the leading part in \\"Zu neuen Ufern\\" (To New Shores), the new picture, with English titles, at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre, is very popular on the stage in her native land and also in Vienna. It was her triumph in the Austrian capital last Winter that caused the Ufa to hire her in the hope of finding a \\"second Garbo.\\"I would be unfair to judge Miss Leander from a single film, and that only her second. Nevertheless despite her undoubted charm, in a rather subdued and tragic manner, and her sweet, extremely low voice, she will have to go a long way before reaching the movie status of her well-known countrywoman. It is to be hoped that Miss Leander will get a chance to show her abilities in something lighter than this well-known screen account of an imaginary, but quite possible, happening in the settlement of Australia a century ago.Willi Birgel is excellent as the dashing but irresolute officer for whose sake Zarah accepts responsibility for forging a check and is transported for seven years. Viktor Staal is the likely young farmer whose love is destined to make the innocent convict forget her mistake. There are many highly interesting scenes and Detlief Sierck's direction is smooth. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th Street Casino"},{"year":"1939","title":"While \\"Die Gläserne Kugel\\" (The Glass Ball), the new importation at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre, is far from being \\"a silent, cold mystery,\\" as is averred on the program, because the audience knows right in the beginning who made away with the 40,000 schillings, there is enough suspense in the development of the story to make this Bavaria film passable entertainment. Peter Stanchina, a fresh name among Teuton directors, certainly had plenty of good acting material at hand.Likely Albrecht Schönhals is the young man jailed for a theft he did not commit because his girl friend (Hilde von Stolz) feared the wrath of her rich, elderly husband (Theodor Loos) more than she prized her left-handed love. But ten years later, as a widow, she recognizes him in the person of a dare-devil vaudeville performer in a glass ball and threatens to denounce him as an escaped convict unless he abandons his circus sweetheart (Sabine Peters) and returns to her. Paul Henckels is more serious than usual in the role of the inventor of the glass-ball stunt. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th Street Casino"},{"year":"1939","title":"A picture fraught with a message of love and understanding is rather disconcerting, coming from the \\"Class B\\" or (less professionally) the cop-and-robbers department of Columbia Pictures, but that is precisely what one has to reckon with in \\"Parents on Trial\\" at the Globe. The message—that sometimes the trouble is caused by problem parents instead of problem children, and that consequently well-meaning parents would do well not to obstruct the normal emotional out-lets of their offspring—is one in which we must all acquiesce. The fact that Jean Parker plays the misunderstood daughter and Henry Kolker the tyrannical father, of course, makes it easier.At the 86th Street CasinoPert little Jenny Jugo is the \\"hopeless case\\" in \\"Ein hoffnung-sloser Fall,\\" the new German film at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre. She is right in her element as the headstrong daughter of a rich and indulgent father (Leo Peukert) bent upon showing a great plastic surgeon (Karl Ludwig Diehl), who has saved her pretty face from permanent disfigurement, that she isn't just a flighty idler.When she starts to study medicine, of course, the surgeon is one of her professors, but her heart interest soon is centered upon a fellow-student (Hannes Stelzer), who happens to board at the same place. How Jenny breaks down his \\"sales resistance,\\" largely due to the professor's hard-boiled advice to leave love alone until well established, is well worth seeing. When they sail for Argentina together, much to his surprise, the good wishes of the audience go with them.This merry piece was directed by Erich Engel for the Klagemann Film concern. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th Street Casino"},{"year":"1940","title":"The lesson being so merrily taught in \\"Anton der Letzte\\" (Anthony the Last) at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre these days is far from novel. Of course, there is no good reason why the son (Otto Wilhelm Fischer) of a kindly nobleman (Heinz Salfner) should fail to \\"make an honest woman\\" of the attractive daughter (Elfriede Datzig) of the hard-working lessee (Hans A. Schletow) of the baron's land, but the way Hans Moser, as the deus ex machina, brings it about is amusing.The evolution of this popular Viennese comedian from a conservative and snobbish butler into a real human being under the pressure of circumstances upon his better nature is well worth observing. Charlotte Ander and Gertrude Wolle are first-rate as a pair of impoverished noblewomen with matrimonial designs upon the widowed baron. E. W. Emo produced and directed the picture.At 86th St. Garden TheatreAfter a run of three weeks the first part of \\"Olympia, Festival of the Nations,\\" the German celluloid record, directed by Leni Riefenstahl, of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, has made way for the latter half at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre.While it gets off to a rather slow start, Part II speeds up when the exciting military riding competition hits the screen and continues at a lively pace through the field hockey, polo, soccer and cycling events and the Marathon race to the thrilling finale of the decathelon, where Glen Morris, the American, won the title of the greatest all-around athlete in the world.The photography is always effective and sometimes brilliant. There is an adequate account of the doings spoken in English.At Radio Teatro HispanoJust why the title of \\"La Chismosa\\" (The Gossiper), the Argentine film now at the Radio Teatro Hispano, is in the singular seems a puzzle, because the female busybodies who spread the news that the pretty convent-bred debutante (Amanda Verela) didn't come from a \\"good\\" family after all were rather numerous. The veteran Spanish actress, Lola Membrives, is excellent as the hard-working foster-mother, and so is José Olarra as her husband. The ending is satisfactory and there are some fine views of life on the Parana River. Enrique T. Susini directed this Lumiton production. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th Street Casino"},{"year":"1940","title":"If the spirit of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart could have picked the vehicle for its reincarnation a century and a half after the death of the great Austrian composer it hardly could have done better than the Tobis Film concern and Director Leopold Hainisch did in selecting Hannes Stelzer for the leading role in \\"Eine kleine Nachtmusik.\\"Based upon a German novel called \\"Mozart En Route to Prague,\\" this delightful period picture, now at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre, purports to show how Mozart traveling with his wife (Christl Mardayn) from Vienna to the Bohemian capital for the première of his \\"Don Giovanni\\" got the inspiration for the finale of that opera. And Heli Finkenzeller, as a young countess in love with both the musician and his works, especially the \\"Marriage of Figaro,\\" certainly lends color to the legend.Excellent support by a large company, embracing such fine actors as Gustav Waldau, Kurt Meisel, Senta Foltin, Max Gülstorff and Lotta Spira, compliments the first-class performance of the principals. There are many excerpts from Mozart's compositions and some lovely ballet bits. The collaboration of the Vienna Philharmonic, the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna State Opera Ballet helped make the film the joy to the eye and ear that it is. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th Street Casino"},{"year":"1940","title":"The story of \\"Opernball\\" (Opera Ball), the amusing semi-musical comedy of matrimonial errors now at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre, is much older than the time of the picture, which is the \\"Gay Nineties.\\" The presence at old Vienna's famous masked ball of more or less errant wives and husbands, with the usual merry mix-ups, has been the theme of many plays and films, almost always done to the satisfaction of the audience.This holds for the current Terra production, directed by Geza von Bolvary. The big cast is practically all-star, including Paul Hörbiger, Will Dohm, Hans Moser, Theo Lingan, Heli Finkenzeller, Erika von Thellmann, Fita Benkhoff and Marte Harell. Miss Harell confirms the good impression she made in her Yorkville screen debut a couple of weeks ago. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the 86th Street Casino"},{"year":"1940","title":"Dainty little Friedl Czepa is the Austrian sport teacher, turned into a title heiress through the death of an uncle in Argentina, for whom Hans Stuewe leaves the attractive daughter (Inge List) of a rich American (the late Alfred Abel) in \\"Alle stehen Kopf\\" (General Confusion), the new Viennese comedy romance at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre.Petroleum, love and high and low financial deals are mixed with some slapstick work and a bit of honest sentiment in such a way as to make the picture moderately entertaining. Fine shots of fancy ice skating in Vienna are contrasted with arresting scenes in the snowy mountains of Styria with good effect. A. M. Rabenalt directed the picture for the EDA concern.At the Teatro LatinoAbout the best thing in the Cuban picture now at the Teatro Latino is the singing of the title piece, \\"La Cancion del Regreso\\" (Home-Coming Song), a few times by Rodolfo Desval, the hero of this slow-paced, unevenly photographed offering. Perlita Greco is comely and capable as the girl who loses her memory when her gallant fiancé disappears after his rival has been killed, but the story is so old that every move is apparent right in the beginning.Sergio Miro, who directed the picture for the C. U. company, managed to create a few funny situations with the help of Alicia Rico and Pepe del Campo.

Michiko Meinl, who is partly, or perhaps wholly, Japanese, plays her part to perfection and reveals a pleasing singing voice. Naturally, youth must be served, so the dashing Hans Jaray, as the orchestra conductor, wins the affection of Michiko. Frau Else Bassermann fills a minor role satisfactorily. The picture was directed for the Kiba concern by Fritz Schultz and its milieu is Viennese musical circles.At the 86th St. Garden TheatreAnother rollicking Bavarian comedy is at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre. \\"Der Schimmel-krieg von Holledau,\\" a more or less merry war between two villages over the theft of a white horse thirty years before 1862, the time of the action, is something like the French \\"Generals Without Buttons,\\" seen here last Winter, but in this case peace really is concluded between the scrappy villagers.Gustav Waldau lends an occasional pathetic touch to the funny complications in the part of a returned wanderer implicated in the original horse row. The plan of the burger-meisters (Theodor Auzinger and Eduard Koeck) to seal the peace pact by the marriage of their respective son (Richard Haeussler) and daughter (Heli Finkenzeller) encounters the usual resistance. This fast-moving UFA picture was directed by A. I. Littl.

He gets into lots of complications, with crooks and honest folk, but returns to find himself a sort of hero and his spouse on the way to reform.Visitors to the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre find plenty of laughs in \\"Krach und Glueck um Kuennemann\\" (Row and Joy About Kuennemann).At the Modern PlayhouseHarking back to the old standby of backstage romance, the Hamza-Korner-Vajda concern of Budapest has turned out a pleasant little comedy called \\"A Doentoe Pillanat\\" (The Crucial Moment), now at the Modern Playhouse.This time, however, the loving couple (Klari Tolnay and Antal Pager) are married when the story begins. Their troubles consist in trying to stick together professionally in spite of the jealous opposition of a fellow-actor (Andor Ajtay), who is an established favorite and tries to break up their happy home. They win through an amusing trick filled with lots of excitement.Gyula Kabos, the veteran comedian, is prominent in the competent cast. Laszlo Vajda directed the picture.

Of course, there is a pretty girl (the brunette Maria Andergast). But although she inspires the young lieutenant to all sorts of rash acts, his first duty is to try to save the regimental standard, and only after he realizes that the organization is wiped out and the World War is over does he consign the tattered bit of silk to the flames and yield whole-heartedly to the call of love.This picture is an excellent presentation of the chaos that obtained in the Austrian forces just before the end of the war, despite the fact that the censor (probably in Germany) cut out the most dramatic part of a scene showing machine guns being turned upon the mutinous regiment. Unfortunately, Herr de Kowa's acting sometimes fails to be convincing. The work of his fellow-players is generally good and the photographic effects occasionally are striking.

When the ambitious and clever girl is surprised by the wife of a local merchant (Herr Schaufuss) while displaying the charms of the new suit she allays the storm by representing herself as the \\"better half\\" of the drummer. Then the much too bashful Felix and his lively partner sign a contract to the effect that their marriage is only a business matter. No great power of imagination is needed to envisage the complications that ensue during their travels, and to divine the final result.There are plenty of laughs in this picture, especially during the ceremonies attending a rifle match, won by Felix. The acting is good throughout.

S. S. R. is fairly timely and interesting.In watching the most dramatic of the incidents—the striking of a mighty \\"gusher\\" in the oil fields around Baku in 1933—it occurs to some spectators that the use of up-to-date American methods might have saved a great deal of the thousands of tons of the valuable fluid that went to waste before the well finally was capped. Another section of the picture outlines the remarkable feat of building the Baltic-White Sea canal, and glories in the fact that the work was done by the Ogpu with convict labor. Stress is laid upon the regenerating influence of strenuous toil upon the forced workers, large numbers of whom thus won their liberty and honors to boot. William C. Bullitt, the American Ambassador, is seen in many of the views.

The title of that book suggests the problem","excerpt":"at the age of 8 days, the infant David had been given away by his natural mother, to a prosperous couple who answered her advertisement in The London Daily Express. (It is appropriate, perhaps, that the fate of so prominent a journalist should have been decided by a newspaper.) He never really expected to see his mother again, but a year after his book's anguished inquiry, she answered. ''Family Secrets'' is the subsequent account of one man's journey toward his unknown parents, which was essentially a journey toward his unknown self. It is one of the oldest stories in the world, at least as old as Telemachus, who set out to find his father, Odysseus, after the Trojan War, and it has survived so long precisely because of its power.

For \\"The Fighting Guardsman,\\" Columbia's cloak and sword adventure, which made its bow at the theatre yesterday, is largely hard riding against a background of the France of Louis XVI. And, if there are also vicious cattle on view at the Garden, then the film at the Ambassador offers the fillip of romance, period costumes and swordplay hardly likely to be seen in the Eighth Avenue arena.\\"The Fighting Guardsman\\" is, naturally, in the tradition of Dumas. Based on his \\"The Companions of Jehu,\\" it is the tale of the Baron de Saint-Hermaine, who, despite his exalted station, also is Roland, the leader of that peasant band, which is vigorously trying to right the wrongs of the crumbling regime. As the Gallic Robin Hood puts it, \\"Our class will learn they have to serve people.\\" The people are served throughout quite copiously and the Baron, it should be noted, gets his just romantic reward. However, judging by the strenuous rapier work, the number of aristocratic coaches robbed and the King's melodramatic downfall, history is staid and drab by comparison.Willard Parker is properly handsome and dashing as the lord of the manor turned people's champion. And with two such charmers as Anita Louise and Janis Carter vying for his affections, it is obvious why there are moments of indecision in his performance. But for all of its cavaliers and derring-do \\"The Fighting Guardsman\\" is a placid masquerade. And, it could just as easily have taken place at Eagle Pass as on the Paris road.

True to its title, it is a fiction concerned with the complications arising from a diary kept by a lacklustre and frustrated young secretary, whose imaginary, supercharged amours involve casual acquaintances and even includes such romantic partners as Charles Boyer and Emile Zola. Perhaps this basic idea had sparkle and merit originally, but as presented on the screen it is largely a contrived and uneven affair, which is rarely humorous and often dull.Peggy Ryan, heretofore a singing and dancing comedienne, is not aided greatly by either the plot or dialogue in projecting the straight role of the spurious \\"femme fatale,\\" who unwittingly almost causes a divorce. William Terry is credible as a press agent, but Jon Hall, as the boss and innocent object of this tempest, and Louise Allbritton as the latter's spouse and discoverer of the incendiary casebook, have a difficult time hurdling stilted situations. Judging by \\"Men in Her Diary,\\" the Ambassador's new, first-run film policy has been inaugurated inauspiciously.

Frankly, Mr. Bowman gets more than the audience does. This low-grade Columbia mystery picture is mechanical, impassive and slow.

As the bold Athenian lady who persuades the members of her sex to boycott their husbands' advances in order to put a stop to war, Miss Helzmeister makes it thoroughly obvious why the gentlemen found it impossible to resist. And she also acts with nice decorum in a much abbreviated role.But an incompleted endeavor to turn this ancient comedy into a comic operetta is evidenced painfully. And the general direction and editing are stiff and amateurish to a fault. Very poor English subtitles and apparent censor cuts in many scenes render this film a doubtful item for American audiences.

It is, as always, a wonderful place to look, to learn and, from the dealers' perspective, to buy.

I love to browse through eclectic, often tellingly arranged mixtures of art as much as the next person, but the overall results can become a little too homogeneous.

Although the Modern Jazz Quartet is celebrating its 40th anniversary as a group this month, the original members were playing together in Dizzy Gillespie's orchestra as early as 1946. In fact, the initials M.J.Q. were first used to identify the Milt Jackson Quartet in 1951, a year before the Modern Jazz Quartet became an entity. Since Mr. Jackson, John Lewis, Percy Heath and Kenny Clarke became the Modern Jazz Quartet in 1952, there has been only one change in its makeup, when Mr. Clarke, the drummer, went to France in 1955 and was replaced by Connie Kay. Since then the same four musicians have been creating, polishing and re-creating one of the most rewarding repertories in jazz, based on the compositions of Mr. Lewis and Mr. Jackson. They play in the Cafe Carlyle tonight and tomorrow at 8:45 and 10:45 P.M. There is a music charge of $35, plus a $10 minimum.

Yet in three decades New Yorkers have had relatively few opportunities to hear Mr. Anderson because his public performing has been limited by two physical disabilities: he is blind, and his bones are so brittle that they break easily and frequently. But on Sunday he is to appear at Birdland for three sets, at 9 P.M., 10:30 P.M. and midnight, with Lisle Atkinson on bass and Winard Harper of the Harper Brothers on drums.

Carl Jefferson, who owns the perceptively swinging jazz label Concord Records, heard the clarinetist and saxophonist playing at J's a couple of years ago and signed him to make his first album. As a result, his debut album was made at J's. Now he is to make his second album, again for Concord and again to be recorded live at J's.tomorrow night.

Joe Morello, who was the drummer in Dave Brubeck's Quartet during its glory years, 1955 to 1967, has spent the years since teaching and running drum clinics, mostly in New Jersey, where he lives. He performs from time to time in New Jersey and on rare occasions crosses the Hudson to appear in New York City. This weekend is one of those rare occasions.

Mulgrew Miller has developed slowly and steadily over the last decade to emerge as one of the strongest pianists in contemporary jazz. He was influenced by such veterans as McCoy Tyner and Wynton Kelly, took on the heritage of Duke Ellington as the pianist in Mercer Ellington's band and added the polish with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers.

We got it. The next sequence found Mr. Drake pointing out the advantages of a harvesting machine over the technique of the threshing floor. And there were, he added, about 40,000 of these machines now in operation in Russia. We were quite impressed, but not so much as we might have been had Mr. Drake's opus been screened about five or ten years ago when the Soviet mechanizing machine was getting into stride.For \\"Russia Marches On\\" is obviously dated, filmed no one knows when and given contemporary meaning chiefly by its narration. Much of its material is interesting, graphic and colorful, but one's attention is more likely to be held by its travelogic content than by its monologric.

Jorge Negrete, who sings quite well and wears his clothes beautifully, is a likable sort of actor, but little more.

And it is well worth seeing—and hearing.The light soprano voice of Ewa Brandowska-Turska is as agreeable to the ear as her blond shadow is to the eye. Ladis Kiepura, a younger brother of the better-known Jan, reveals himself as the possessor of a pleasant tenor and as a passable actor in the part of the faithful mountaineer who sticks to Halka after she has been cast aside by Janusz, a handsome young nobleman. Unfortunately, Ewa seems to have been overwhelmed by the fact that she had to act crazy in the latter part of the picture, so she \\"mugs\\" a great deal in the early sequences.

Rino Naldi makes the best of his part as the young music professor whose refusal to listen to reason is responsible for the tragedy.

Especially when she shows the world, in a brilliant and frequently touching dialogue, that although her fortunes may be at a low ebb she still knows what is going on and the respect to which she is entitled.While the other players, including Mirabella Pardi and Luigi Cimari in the role of a fine young couple, and Cesare Beltarini as the stern father vainly trying to stop their marriage, are good, their work is merely incidental to that of the leading lady.

Signor Centa is a noted soccer player, always in need of money, but with a rich aunt (Pina Gallina). He manages to scrape an acquaintance with the pretty Elisa, and she wins 2,000 lire by following his advice. When he goes to cash her ticket, they are separated by the crowd.

Even their summary change of the story's locale from Salem to Bristol is trivial when it is measured against the major flaws which hinder \\"Java Head\\" in its recital of those brave days when the clipper ships danced triumphantly on all the seven seas.Although such excellent players as Edmund Gwenn, John Loder, Elizabeth Allan and Anna May Wong are among those present, they are seldom able to relieve the tedium of a windy and poorly accented script. The film, in addition, is so defective in the sheer mechanics of reproduction that only occasional lines or dialogue can be heard distinctly, and the photography lacks clarity and definition.It is an occasion these days when a reviewer is forced to judge the entertainment value of a photoplay in such chill terms as mechanical efficiency. But it is a melancholy fact that \\"Java Head\\" forces the spectator to spend so much of his energy attuning his eyes and ears to what is going on that he seldom is able to settle back into a comfortable receptive mood.Mr. Hergesheimer's complex novel, as it reaches the screen, becomes chiefly the story of Gerrit Ammidon, son of a famous shipping family, who brings home a Manchu lady for his wife and shocks his family and the townsfolk. Even when \\"Java Head\\" is severely telescoped to meet the needs of the screen, it contains the passion, pride and prejudice of splendid drama.

For instance, if you visit a boyhood friend with a highly attractive wife, fall temporarily in love with her and nobly resolve to avoid trouble by leaving in a hurry, don't tell the husband the real reason for your departure, regardless of how hard he may press you for an explanation.Of course, if the likable Nino Besozzi had known this commonplace, we should not have the fun of watching the sprightly and popular Elsa Merlini do a swell caricature of the way a romantic lady is supposed to act under such circumstances, nor of seeing Enrico Viarisio again prove himself one of Italy's best comedians. Lisl Ander is satisfactory as a gay widow and Aristide Baghetti makes a forgetful old man really amusing.

He really should have been punished more severely for overlooking her charm because of the presence of a sporty city blonde (Germana Paolieri) visiting her brother, the local railroad trouble-shooter.The nub of the action consists of a telephone flirtation between the neglected wife and an operator (Umberto Sacripanti) at another station, who is so ugly looking that he dare not meet her face to face. Both the operator and a handsome pal (Mino D'Oro) are on the train when it is forced to stop at Mezzaselva. Excellent acting all around and the smooth direction of Corrado D'Enrico make the development of this Imperator production plausible and entertaining.

Directed by Amleto Palermi for the Ventura Film Company, this light mixture of slapstick and wisecracks may be classified as a minor Musco.Ably assisted by Rosina Anselmi, Camillo Pilotto, Francesco Amodio, Carmelina Mangoli and many others, the jovial village matchmaker carries on his chosen avocation of encouraging matrimony and population increase, à la Duce, in the midst of lots of more or less melodious noises, to the general hilarity of the audience. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Cine Roma"},{"year":"1940","title":"The blond beauty of Caterina Boratto and the still golden voice of Tito Schipa make a visit to the Cine Roma in West Forty-ninth Street well worth while, even for persons unfamiliar with the language of \\"Chi è piu felice di me?\\" (\\"Who Is Happier Than I?\\"), an Italian film which had its New York première yesterday.The popular tenor and the charming girl who was his partner in \\"Vivere,\\" shown here in November, 1938, have a somewhat better story in the present offering, and Guido Brignone has directed them with his usual dexterity. While there is nothing original (on the screen) in having a middle-aged opera singer regenerated morally by the love of a young woman, there are several novel twists in the new picture. When Signor Schipa plays a musical Santa Claus in the children's ward of the hospital, where lies the victim of his careless driving, it need not surprise members of the audience to find lumps in their throats.Naturally, the action is built around a number of folk songs and operatic selections, including some from \\"Andrea Chénier,\\" with the title piece reserved for the finale.

Technically, except for lethargic direction, the new importation at the Cine-Roma is superior to the average film that emerges from our Hollywood studios.Covering that colorful period between 1892-1922, the film has an undeniable epic quality—taking its principal characters through years of privation and pestilence from yellow fever to a period of flourishing prosperity brought about, the film maintains, by the untiring efforts of the Italian émigrés, who gave South America its first important railroad. Then comes the drama of Italy's entrance into the World War and the recruiting of Italian subjects. Sons of the émigrés respond to the man, proving that even Italians born on foreign soil are loyal to their parents' fatherland. \\"Passaporto Rosso\\" is undoubtedly the most conspicuous recruiting poster turned out so far by the Italian film producers.The film is exceptionally well acted and has a beautiful and appealing heroine in Isa Miranda, who bears a striking resemblance to Marlene Dietrich and would be a sparkling addition to the Hollywood firmament.

And not only that, for now it also begins to appear that all country doctors are Jean Hersholt, who is family physician in \\"Meet Doctor Christian,\\" at the Palace. There are certain undeniable advantages in this arrangement, both for Mr. Hersholt and for medical science, but it does not exactly make for novelty and for the element of audience surprise.The plot also might be changed occasionally, if only for hygiene's sake: certainly the one about the injured child of the town sourpuss (the one who opposes construction of a hospital) and the delicate brain operation with primitive implements, has been handled and kicked about too much not to be slightly germ-laden. This time Dr. Hersholt has about the ailingest group of patients in his career and, though he is almost as busy as the Mayo Clinic, he does his customary fine job of healing everybody and everything in sight except the plot.At the CinecittaIt would be hard to find a more realistic desert film than \\"Lo Squadrone Bianco,\\" the new Italian picture at the Cinecitta. That this always entertaining, and at times gripping, screen effort was \\"shot\\" mostly in Libya is easily believed. While the story is built around a punitory expedition of a small unit of native troops (labeled \\"The White Squadron,\\" presumably from the color of their clothing) sent against a rebellious group, the scenes of hardship and fighting have been kept within proper bounds and there is no undue glorification of militarism.Antonio Centa is excellent as a young lieutenant who tries to forget his infatuation for a pretty, heartless and rather alluring, society woman (Fulvia Lanzi) by being transferred to Libya. Fosco Giachetti is the very type of commanding officer capable of enforcing strict discipline and at the same time of becoming the idol of his men. Although the discerning patron can figure out much of the action in advance, Augusto Genina has directed this Esperia Film release so smoothly and has worked in so many interesting incidents that one's attention is held right to the end. Full credit should be given to the numerous camels for their effective collaboration.

But those who appreciate a good, old-fashioned love story done in a highly modern setting and well acted by a company of fine, clean young folk, and a few not so young, are sure to be satisfied.Although labeled a comedy and filled with amusing incidents, \\"Ungdom av i Dag\\" is not of the slapstick order, and it has enough serious moments to show that Anne-Marie Brunius is an actress as well as a joy to the eye. She is cast as the wholesome, sport-loving daughter of a silly countess, who is determined that the girl shall marry Walter, a rich nonentity, to save his family from financial disgrace. Tony's hand, however, eventually is won by Gunnar, a handsome young cadet in the military aviation school.Before the end is reached, the audience enjoys many excellent views of flying and delightful scenes in city and country.

A score of years later, Mme. Fortier escapes and gets a job as a deliverer of bread for a bakery restaurant patronized by her daughter, Louise. The daughter, a dressmaker, is engaged to Lucien, the son of the very man her mother was accused of killing. Naturally, nobody is aware of the identity of anybody else, except the villains, Garaud and Soliveau, the former of whom is planning to marry his attractive American-born daughter, Mary, to Lucien.The complicated situation is cleared up by a completely satisfactory dénouement in the last reel. Acted by a highly competent cast, including the popular Paris comedians, Drean and Fernandel, as the rowdy baker boys, \\"La Porteuse de Pain\\" may prove engaging for patrons not too insistent upon sophisticated screen fare. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Cinema de Paris"},{"year":"1936","title":"Although the language of the current importation at the little Cinéma de Paris is Swedish, the locale of much of \\"Raggen, det aer jag det\\" (Raggen, That's Me) is in Paris.Isa Quensel, as the sprightly eldest of a family of five girls who makes a flying trip to Paris to seek distraction from home and office troubles, is decidedly attractive in a wholesome way and keeps the audience amused with her witty remarks. When she and a girl friend encounter Consul Westerlund, an American, in a cabaret the spectators know at once that the Consul, who compels Raggen to try out her high school English in talking with him, will be at home in Swedish in the end. But the action moves so smoothly and there are so many funny situations that the obviousness of the \\"plot\\" may be forgiven.The rest of the cast does excellent work, the scenes in Sweden and Paris are well done and the picture is interesting for persons familiar with its language. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Cinema de Paris"},{"year":"1937","title":"The first Danish dialogue picture to reach New York is a pleasing combination of travelogue, comedy and romance called \\"Sun Over Denmark.\\" Patrons of the Cinema de Paris in lower Fifth Avenue may get an insight into the pleasures of touring in King Christian's contented little country by following the fortunes of Grete Sjoelin and Gerda Newmann, pretty girls who find adventure and fine young husbands (Knud Rex and Bent Bentzen) during their Summer vacation.In the course of their wanderings on (and off) their bicycles the girls visit many lovely places along the countryside and at the beaches and a general good time is had by all. Bruno Tyron, as a rotund motor truck driver, and Sigrid Horne-Rasmussen, as his buxom sweetheart, are responsible for much of the fun.The story is of slight consequence and no knowledge of Danish is needed to understand what it is all about. The acting is efficient and the photography, with a few exceptions, is clear. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Cinema de Paris"},{"year":"1937","title":"Farmers in Southern Sweden should have no trouble in getting all the hired men they need this Spring, if conditions on their places are half as ideal as those depicted in \\"Soeder om Landsvaegen\\" (\\"South of the Highway\\"), the delightful rural comedy-romance now at the Cinéma de Paris. Most of the film was taken at Gaardsloesa, the birthplace of Charles A. Lindbergh's father.That excellent comedian, Edvard Persson, is at his best as the typical upright Swedish farmer. Inga-Bodil Vetterlund, a youthful newcomer to the screen, is charming enough to justify the evil Sheriff's designs upon her hand and to make the gallant and rich young aviator, Nils Ekman, who wins her, an object of congratulation.The subsidiary romances are woven through the main theme skillfully and provide the audience with plenty of fun. There are several pleasing folksongs and some real country dancing. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Cinema de Paris"},{"year":"1937","title":"Making one of its frequent language switches, the little Cinema de Paris is now presenting \\"Adolf Armstrong,\\" a rollicking importation from Stockholm, for the amusement of persons familiar with Swedish and appreciative of a fine burlesque of the brave days \\"When Knighthood Was in Flower.\\"Adolf Jahr, in the title role, is a bashful young professor unable to get up enough grit to propose to the beautiful blonde Alice Skoglund, despite her discreet encouragement. But one evening at a dinner party Adolf goes into a doze while a friend is strumming a guitar. Then he dreams the whole company is back in the Middle Ages and that he is wooing his chosen lady according to the rules of chivalry. What follows is a riot of swashbuckling adventure, hard drinking and song. He awakes just as he is carrying Alice away on his noble steed. Fired by the dream, the professor pops the question right there and all is well.All the actors are excellent, the music is entertaining and Sigurd Wallen's direction is smooth. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Cinema de Paris"},{"year":"1953","title":"The suds ooze so thick and fast from the Cinema Verdi's new Italian import, \\"Duel Without Honor,\\" that the average spectator may visualize a lava bed sloping down Mount Vesuvius. The best to be said about this emotional tidal wave, distributed by I. F. E. Releasing Corporation, is that some of the participants have previously been seen to drier advantage. The Manenti Film Production, written by Gaspare Cataldo and Camillo Mastrocinque, concerns an overwhelmingly selfless young woman who loves a good man and, after several reels of evil machinations by her cousin, lands him. Since Mr. Mastrocinque also directed these gloomy, bleeding contrivances, the principals, Annette Bach, Massimo Girotti and Constance Dowling, don't stand a chance.As the picture opens Miss Bach is returning home from a convent, where acute memories of the past discouraged her taking of the final vows. A flashback recounts her engagement to Mr. Girotti, a banker, the lady's happy encouragement by Miss Dowling, and a mysterious desertion on her wedding day. The heroine then discovers, to her horror, that her dear cousin had perpetrated the desertion, annexed the wealthy hero for her own spouse and now blandly carries on with two lovers. Moving at a snail's pace, the action reaches a showdown between the two women, as Miss Bach tearfully pleads for some consideration for her ex-fiancé and Miss Dowling snarls back.Although the latter meets her doom at the hands of an infatuated painter, Miss Dowling's shrewd aggressiveness, conveyed by snapping eyes and a coarsened jawline, is far more intriguing than Miss Bach's agonized piety. Mr. Girotti makes a handsome but colorless pawn. Roldano Lupi and Ave Ninchi fill minor roles adequately. And the whole thing is a crawling bore.

Bardot as a sleuth. Annette Wademant's screen play, based on a novel, \\"The Blonde Died Dancing,\\" by Kelley Roos, is a shoddy piece of mystery writing that calls for its shapely star to be more seductive than deduc-tive—and, believe us, that isn't much.As a happily married woman who takes a job in a dance studio in order to find out who murdered the proprietress—a crime of which her husband is in peril of being accused—the actress does a lot of wiggling while snooping around the joint, but her physical and mental exercises are of little help to the detectives trying to solve the crime. They mainly create confusion, sometimes in a weakly humorous way, until the time comes to tag the villain. He turns out to be a rather disagreeable transvestite.Mlle. Bardo has done better. So has Henri Vidal, who plays her husband—although he does get some nice work in a couple of intimate scenes. One of these is with Dawn Addams, who plays a red-headed blackmailer. Others are with Mlle. Bardot. Those might be suspected as the raison d'être of the film.It is in color, and it makes little difference whether you see it in the original French or with dubbed dialogue, as we say, because neither is particularly felicitous and the atmosphere is all in what you see, which means that it is mostly concentrated in the person of Mlle. Bardot.On the bill at the Baronet is a lively and picturesque thirty-minute short, \\"Zero to Sixty.\\" It scans the history of auto racing in this country, from earliest days to the annual sports-car race at Sebring, Fla., and has more zing, per cubic inch, than La Bardot.

While the critics have not yet judged the work, the three shows - unusual in scope and size for any artist, much less one who arrived in New York not even eight years ago - already raises several interesting questions. One is whether they will position Mr. Sawka, who was best known in Poland and the West as a designer of theatrical posters, more in the mainstream of modern Western painting.

When the economy is booming, the Fed is very good at slowing it down -- reducing inflation but also making it harder for people to buy homes, keep jobs and purchase cars. Then, a funny thing happens once the economy slows: The Fed gets reluctant to bring back prosperity.    That reluctance is very much in evidence now. Until February, the economy was robust. The Fed's response, given its visceral hatred of inflation, was to slow it down by doubling interest rates in the space of a year.

Unfortunately the story of Captain Mollenard and his thin-lipped marital antagonist does not measurably illuminate the occasion, and there were moments on Saturday afternoon when we found ourselves listening instead to the ghostly gayety of \\"La Kermesse Heroique,\\" or the moving colloquies of \\"Grand Illusion.\\" \\"Hatred\\" cannot stand in that tradition. Despite excellent performances by Harry Baur and Gabrielle Dorziat, it is haggard drama, unrelentingly grim and strangely inconclusive.Perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact that the author never gives poignance to the 20-year war of attrition between the captain and his recriminating wife by stressing its crucial effect upon the inheritors, the children. From the moment the captain is suspended for gun-running and is brought back from the sea to spend the period of punishment with his wife, the conflict becomes static because there can be no issue but defeat for both. But the two warped children, who could give depth and point to the conflict, are little more than wispy wraiths of characters that are hardly brought into the drama.Here and there in a baldly stated narrative, Mr. Baur touches some of the inner torment of the relationship, as when, stricken by paralysis, he helplessly implores his wife to release him from his own house, and she, for the sake of that final hypocrisy — appearances — refuses. But for the most part \\"Hatred\\" is unrelieved by any note of compassion that, as in \\"Poil de Carotte,\\" would make its impact shattering. It is more clinical than wise of heart.

But a viewer might easily get the notion that what he is really out to do is crowd the screen with the scorching sensuality of his star performer, Brigitte Bardot.For never has this famous Gallic siren been so frankly and ferociously employed as a symbol of sexual intemperance and rebellion as she is in this film, which had a dual presentation at the Paris and the Forum yesterday. (At the Paris, it is shown with English subtitles","excerpt":"at the Forum, with dubbed English dialogue.)Introduced as a sullen young woman on trial for murdering a lover — one of many, as the drama reveals—the brazen Brigitte very quickly changes pace from her demeanor in court and displays the audacity of a trollop as the flashback story of her life is told. Brother, what a story! And what a field day for Mlle. Bardot! By comparison, \\"And God Created Woman\\" is a fable for children in school.It is the story of this naughty young woman, a beatnik in Paris' Montparnasse, who steals her proper sister's finance, teases him for a spell (during which she is taking other lovers) then glumly submits to him. Lo and behold, she finds she loves him, and they are happy for a while, until he finds he has to get back to his music and she wants to get back with the gang down at the Dome.That's the beginning of their battles and her descent down the road to utter shame, which leads to prostitution and a few other disgreeable things. Eventually, she goes to his apartment intending to commit suicide, but somehow the gun she is toting is carelessly turned on him. What happens then, and what it leads to when it is luridly thrashed out at the trial, provides explosive material for the climax of this highly theatrical film.Actually it is a banal story, barely worthy of M. Clouzot, and the young woman under close inspection is a tabloid newspaper stereotype. Her kind and her mawkish dilemma have been played up and sensationalized in a dozen or more Hollywood pictures in the last thirty years.The big difference here is that M. Clouzot, a man of superior skill, has filled his courtroom drama with high tension and has been uncommonly bold in dishing up Mlle. Bardot. The legal and forensic clashes of the lawyers, played by Charles Vanel and Paul Meurisse, both of whom will be remembered from M. Clouzot's superb \\"Diabolique,\\" ring with fierce and biting passion and the whole courtroom atmosphere is that of a dissecting chamber where men with knives go after the truth.And Mlle. Bardot's performance runs an interesting range, from cold and contemptuous aloofness to abandoned sensuality. Familiar as are her mannerisms and attitudes in those scenes that display erotic implications, their shameless candor is meaningful here, suggesting the anarchism of a stratum of contemporary youth. The lover is played with nervous vigor by bright-eyed Sami Frey, a crisp, ferretlike little fellow with a mop of wild black hair.The sister is played with prim decorum by Marie-Jose Nat and several disheveled young people perform the denizens of Montparnasse.As for the truth that is discovered—well, it seems to be that love is a human condition that has to be handled delicately. That is the way it isn't handled by the characters in this film—and they're not very subtle characters, either. It is all rather obvious, we would say.

It isn't just that there is something so engagingly obvious about the way it first lines up all its nice people on one side and all its bad people on another, then lets the bad people get the drop, and at the critical moment has the nice people come marching in with guns. The fact is we have run the gamut of the lower production orders—Classes B, C, D and so on—too often now to be tickled by such a naively business-like approach, though we admit it is rather endearing.Our feeling about \\"Convicted\\" goes deeper than that. For us, its one really timeless feature is that dramatic instant when the medical examiner (an anonymous gentleman not even mentioned in the cast of characters), after having examined the body of the murdered woman, walks up to Detective Charles Quigley while pocketing his stethoscope, clears his throat with professional dignity and mutters in clipped, confidential tones: \\"Strangulation, collapse of the larnex.\\" It is moments like this which convince you that the movies really are your best entertainment.

It's a funny thing, and hardly consistent with the Good Neighbor policy, that all crooked night-club owners should be such pronounced Latin types. And why must there always be a columnist?

Around the inspiring examples of a group of adolescent shoplifters who are suddenly made to hear the still, small voice of conscience by a shrewd schoolmaster, the scenarists have written a jerry-built script, more wordy than dramatic.The performances of the young girls are credible insofar as the story allows them to be, but the moral is pat and the situations—as frequently happens in these object lessons—forced for the sake of it. A highly moral message is good as far as it goes, but it does help to have some honestly dramatic play-writing to support it. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Globe"},{"year":"1940","title":"The war of attrition between John Garfield and the law of the realm—or is it just the Warner Brothers—seems perilously close to its final stages in \\"East of the River,\\" now at the Globe. Perhaps the uses of Mr. Garfield's talent are nobody's business but his own and Warners', but by the same token it is this corner's business to describe their latest collaboration as a contrived and hackneyed repetition of Mr. Garfield's previous case histories of wastrels, each with a streak of nobility which the scenarists reveal by releasing a sliding panel in the plot. The whole film has the look of a catch-penny attempt to cash in on Mr. Garfield's drawing power at the box office. Quite probably it will succeed, but it will not increase his limited range as an actor.This time he is the unregenerate son of Mama Ravioli, who returns to New York from a three-year sabbatical in San Quentin to watch his adopted brother's graduation, to take in the town with a comely young moll as companion and to \\"get\\" the two thugs responsible for his enforced absence from civilian life. The aforementioned nobility gets an airing when the young lady finds solace with the adopted brother, and Mr. Garfield, after an appeal from mama, steps aside.It all adds up to synthetic drama with adequate performances by Brenda Marshall as the gun-moll and George Tobias in a small part as an Italian waiter. Marjorie Rambeau, as mama, strives with an Italian accent, and Mr. Garfield can still make a line like \\"When you're in the swamps, you look out for the snakes\\" sound like authentic Second Avenue philosophy. But if such a line were fresh a couple of years ago, it seems singularly mannered now. Isn't it high time that the Warners allowed Mr. Garfield really to reform—and stay that way? THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Globe"},{"year":"1940","title":"Those convicts are on the rampage again. Lest we forget that there's drama behind the prison bars, Columbia has selected a corps of tough-visaged extras, clothed them in gray garb and serial numbers and set their resentments smoldering in \\"Men Without Souls,\\" now at the Globe. Within the dimensions of an assembly line story of brutal wardens and angry men, the prisoners gain the opportunity to wreak havoc in several snarling battles. The motivation is crude, but the action is there. A lot of guns go off in this one before all's quiet in the cell blocks, and the newly appointed chaplain convinces the warden of the advantages of a more humane regime.Under the direction of Nick Grinde, who kept the camera focused on the scene of action, John Litel, Barton MacLane and especially Glenn Ford practice more restraint than the scenarists. Sometimes the regenerations effected in hard-bitten outlaws by a little application of the Golden Rule or the ingenuity of the script writers are truly wonderful. Even Blackie Drew, the toughest \\"con\\" of them all, attempts to halt the jailbreak he started, confesses to framing the youth with the electric chair twenty-four hours distant, and expires in an aura of sweetness and light.

A less cautious historian, in fact, might assert flatly that the end has been reached, but a cinematic cycle, like the proverbial serpent, dies hard, with its remote tail flicking cynically, long after the last light has expired from its minute, reptilian brain.Encouraging signs, however, are that the original Dead End Kids have grown out of reform school into the full splendor of penitentiary age, while even the \\"Little Tough Guys,\\" their Class B counterparts, now must be augmented by smaller, tougher urchins, in order to make out a satisfactory feature-length case for the Slum Child vs. Society.In all justice, the fault is probably less with the slums than with the imaginative and histrionic resources of the average motion-picture studio. That is why, although there may and probably will be stubborn, guerrilla attempts to hold out against the inevitable, it seems appropriate, in the melancholy case of \\"East Side Kids,\\" to mourn the passing of a cinema cycle. After this the chances are that any well-meaning producer who ventures to step forward and offer a Boys' Club and a friendly cop as an original sociological solution for prospective hoodlums will simply be taking his life in his hands. It is pretty risky even in the present case, even in a picture in which an actor named James Farley gets eleventh billing.

Based upon the assumption that two heads are better than one, and seven better than two, a reformed convict, who studied chemistry while in escrow, has organized for the purposes of crime detection an extra-legal band of experts on ballistics, psychology, micro-photography—everything, in fact, except a professor on Romance languages. Let crime raise its ugly head in the gangster-ridden city, the august body descends upon the fatal premises as busy as the seven dwarfs, only less tuneful.The police chief, of course, considers them a nuisance—what with seven experts stumbling about a room it's hard to discover the corpse. But when the city's leading reformer is murdered and the chief's daughter taken as hostage against the threat of a dragnet, the boys take over. Yet, though their methods are interesting and their separate findings dovetail with remarkable alacrity, the nature of the crime hardly required the services of such a brain trust. Next time we hope the chief gives them a tougher assignment. This one looked too easy. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Globe"},{"year":"1940","title":"Considering the fact that these are dolorous days in England, \\"Let George Do It,\\" now at the Globe, is something of a phenomenon, interesting not so much as entertainment as evidence of the Britisher's incorrigible \\"thumbs up\\" attitude in the face of mortal danger. As a screwball antic of a goofy ukulele player who, by a prank of fate in a blacked-out London railway station, suddenly finds himself chasing German spies in Norway, this British importation is ragged farce, more mad than gay. But the surprising thing is that it was attempted at all.As crazily contrived as a Rube Goldberg invention, it is the tale of the hapless troubadour who embarks for an engagement in Black-pool, but arrives in Bergen instead, to be greeted as a member of the British espionage. Installed as stool-pigeon in an orchestra led by the head of the German spy ring, timorous George eventually unmasks the villain and the means by which he transmits to waiting submarines the positions of British merchantmen, but not until he has been subjected to the blandishments of a woman spy, plowed through the dough of a bakery in search of a lost code and descended in an enemy submarine, from which he is ejected via the torpedo tube.The case is somewhat brightened by the presence of George Formby in the role of the unheroic hero, but most of the scenes have only a sporadic humor as if the cast and director were half-listening for air-raid sirens at any moment. Besides, to most Americans with memories of the Harold Lloyd epics, this sort of comedy is apt to seem dated—or is it simply that only the English, also incorrigible in their sense of humor, can laugh at their own jokes? THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Globe"},{"year":"1940","title":"Taking the story and some of the shots of \\"SOS Mediterranean,\\" which failed to arouse much response when the original French version arrived on Broadway earlier this year, the British have made a revised version which now is playing at the Globe under the title \\"Hell's Cargo.\\" Though the theme of international solidarity still underlines the action, the British, understandably, are today less embracing in their appeal. In the original version it was a group of French, English and German naval commanders who fell at odds over an embryonic incident, only to become reconciled later. In the present offering the German significantly has been superseded by a Soviet naval officer. There's no spirit of appeasement in this one.The antagonisms arise when a man is mysteriously murdered in an international port and the commanders' respective crews fall under suspicion. The real villain, of course, is the half-mad captain of a ship bearing a contraband cargo of gas chemicals. The commanders are sent in pursuit, the captain releases the gas rather than surrender, and there follows a routine but suspenseful rescue in which the commanders make their way through the gas cloud to save a passenger liner in its path. By this time the officers are on speaking terms again.As melodrama with a message, then, the film is bravely spoken. Perhaps the direction is more often frayed than tightly knit, the situation far-fetched, but it has its moments of urgency nevertheless. The performances of Walter Rilla, Kim Peacock and Robert Newton as the three commanders are convincing, Penelope Dudley Ward is a pleasant excuse for much of the heroics and the minor acting chores are capably done. \\"Hell's Cargo\\" is far from precious freight, but it is sufficiently diverting to deserve a better name. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Globe"},{"year":"1940","title":"As the primer of the lives and loves of airway stewardesses and the heroic pilots, \\"Flight Angels,\\" now at the Globe, requires close scrutiny to distinguish it from numerous other manufactured melodramas of men, women and planes. Is there intramural warfare amid the cloud-bound lassies over the pilot of Flight Number 8? There is. Is there a hard-boiled field superintendent in love with the favored lady? Call him Ralph Bellamy. Does an irritating young hero, after being grounded for failing eyesight, make an unauthorized test flight in the company's new plane, crack up and head for China to fight the Japanese? Not quite. He finds himself in the arms of Virginia Bruce instead. Cliché will have its way.As a program piece of folk whose affinity for high altitudes continues to be nothing short of mystic, the story has been interlarded with some baldly stated facts and statistics on the careers of the crisp young women who fetch bicarbonate of soda for airsick passengers. But the informative asides, like the plot and the sequence of a plane plummeting earthward, are too familiar to be the film's raison d'être. The actors, however, try to speak their lines as though they were brand-new. Miss Bruce, especially, as the stewardess who becomes an impromptu midwife at 8,000 feet, conveys the impression that she'd be a mighty reassuring person to have around during a crisis like that. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Globe"},{"year":"1940","title":"A good deal of further evidence has gone into the record since last Spring when Warners released \\"Confessions of a Nazi Spy,\\" the film based in part on disclosures of the trial here in 1938 of members of the Nazi espionage. In its present revival at the Globe the ending of the film has been revised slightly to include the frightening history of recent weeks. There are synoptic shots of the havoc wreaked by internal Nazi sympathizers in Norway, Holland and Belgium before the parachutes blossom in the sky behind the defense lines. Otherwise, it remains unaltered.If the film is less startling today than a year ago, it is because its exposé of Nazi \\"fifth column\\" preparation before the invasion is now common knowledge and because the scope of treachery has been immeasurably widened. The film overreaches its point in reducing all the Nazi henchmen to stock company villains, but it is a tribute to its prophetic accuracy that the newly inserted sequences become a logical climax as events whose shadows had been cast before them.At the Teatro LatinoThe Mexican importation at the Teatro Latino is at least 100 times better than is indicated by its name. For \\"La Bestia Negra\\" (\\"The Black Beast\\") is merely the freight locomotive that takes the place of his runaway wife in the heart of an engineer (Fernando Soler).Surrounded by such sterling actors as Arturo de Cordoba, Antonio R. Frausto, Carlos Moctezuma, Luis G. Barreiro, Domingo Soler and Adria Delhort, little Mary Lopez (a sort of happy medium between Shirley Temple and Jane Withers) steals the show from them most of the time.

A good example of this gratuitous largesse is \\"Penitentiary,\\" at the Globe: a melodrama which has been made often enough for everybody to excuse a certain pedestrianism in the telling. But Columbia, borne on the wings of some mysterious hack-inspiration, has made of it an unexpectedly exciting piece of pulpwood fiction.The story is the one about an impetuous young man (John Howard) who is sent up for manslaughter by District Attorney Walter Connolly—who later becomes prison warden and who has a pretty daughter (Jean Parker). When John is on the verge of an emotional and moral crack-up, he is made chauffeur to the warden—and Jean is notorious for bringing out the better side of a man's nature. The conflict, when John witnesses the killing of a \\"squealer\\" by another prisoner, between his loyalty to the prison code on the one hand and to Jean's world on the other is resolved with great convenience when the guilty party decides to shoot it out with the guards. You've seen it all before, of course.At the Teatro HispanoThe Argentine film at the Teatro Hispano, \\"Que Tiempos Aquellos\\" (Those Were the Days!), fails to come up to the expectations aroused by its name. While it is true that the audience is shown a few fairly interesting scenes of society life and dance halls in Buenos Aires in 1906, before the tango had become respectable, contrasted with conditions there thirty years later, most of the action is devoted to misplaced love.Florencio Parravicini, a dependable Argentine comedian, lightens the sad story a bit as the bachelor pal of a rich youth (Santiago Arrieta), forced by convention and his own hastiness into marrying a personable, but shallow, society girl (Irma Cordoba), when his affections really belong to an attractive cabaret dancer (Mecha Ortiz).

Mr. Kelly runs a legitimate business and is a great friend of Father Joe, the priest who runs the settlement house. In his quiet way Father Joe takes Mr. Ayres's gun away from him and puts him to work as boxing instructor at the settlement. The trouble begins when Mr. Ayres falls in love with Miss Mae Clark, who is Mr. Kelly's dream girl. Then there is a baby whom Miss Clarke is caring for, although Mr. Kelly, without knowing it, is the father. Complicated as this may seem, it works out all right at the Globe Theatre. When the rivals decide to have it out, Father Joe makes them throw away their guns and settle the argument with their fists. After that they become great friends, Mr. Kelly getting the baby and Mr. Ayres getting Miss Clarke.Although the film is a trifle ancient in its choice of materials, it serves the same function and has about the same merit as the average short story in the popular magazines. Unpretentious and amiably commonplace, it really is rather decent about not startling the customers by any sudden introduction of the unexpected. Mr. Ayres and Miss Clarke have not been seen hereabouts in several years and there is a nice nostalgia about the whole enterprise. \\"Silk Hat Kid\\" might easily be one of the pictures they were making back in 1930 and '31. Mr. Kelly is credible and pleasing even when he's being pretty mean about donating money for the Summer camp. That other fine actor, William Harrigan, is excellent as the settlement priest.

The underworld henceforth may expect no gilding from the cinema and, in theory, there is to be no hint of the rapscallion gallantry among motion-picture outlaws which persuaded the late Mr. Dillinger to spend his last hour watching a crime melodrama. The millionaire scofflaw in the film at the Globe is scornfully presented as a rat who deserted his wife and child in their time of need. There is about it an aroma of the headlines as it lands the fellow behind bars for his income-tax lapses.Except for its slight historical interest, \\"The People's Enemy\\" subscribes to the gas-house school of crime fiction and imposes a grave strain on the credulity.

For Andrew Stone, who not only wrote but also produced and directed this comedy drama about four department-store salesgirls who unite into a spurious family, complete with spurious parents, in order to snag rich husbands, apparently had all the authority and brought forth only a passing fair entertainment.While Mr. Stone's imagination was not startling in turning out this offering, he does, however, rate plaudits for having concocted a generally lively tale embellished with a bright twist or two. Credit Mr. Stone also for having obtained the services of Adolphe Menjou as the \\"father\\" of this scheming crew. As the middle-aged skinflint of a floorwalker who is badgered into taking on a family and who turns out to be an understanding and pretty tenderhearted fellow after all, Mr. Menjou's characterization, for all of its implausibility, is surprisingly facile and warm. On the credit side of the ledger also is Eugene List, the concert pianist, who, as a GI, regaled President Truman and Premiers Stalin and Churchill at the Potsdam Conference. Mr. List's acting does not hide the fact that this is his screen debut, but he makes up for awkward histrionics with some laudable renditions of Chopin and other classics.Gail Russell, Claire Trevor, Ann Dvorak and Jane Wyatt, as the salesladies who pool their resources and rent a Long Island estate to put up an impressive front for prospective mates, are competent in prosaically written roles. And Billie Burke again is her fluttery self as the \\"mother.\\" In short, Mr. Stone's cast is playing Cinderella again. They haven't improved the story, but they haven't hurt it either.

Mr. Madalena worked for George Eastman in Rochester, designing posters for the movie palace Eastman personally owned.

(And, just to clear the the air, we'll mention that Annabella's Aischa is nautchy, but nice.)M. Duvivier's plot, his and Charles Spaak's, is not exactly virgin territory. Foreign legions, Spanish or French, always have been the accepted refuges of wanted men and their pursuers: cats and mice in the desert. But it is possible to get behind the externals, to develop the drama psychologically, to build up steadily to the close of the chase and then, with typical Gallic fatalism and irony—as de Maupassant might have written it—leave the solution to destiny. All this Duvivier has done.The picture shows signs of careless editing or careful censoring. There is a charitable gap between the murderer's tea-taking with the dazzling Aischa and his proposal of marriage. There is another between her rendezvous with the police agent and her discovery of his secret mission. The omissions contribute to the illusionary niceness of Annabella's henna'd hamadryad, but she still is more lively than Hollywood ever let her be—and more convincing.Typically Gallic and typically Duvivier is the play and by-play of the narrative's people, even of the lesser ones. Jean Gabin's performance of the wanted man dominates the others inevitably, but not so completely as to dwarf Robert Le Vigan's ferret-like police agent, Pierre Renoir's legion commander, or Gaston Modot's rebellious legionnaire.But best of all, and the picture's chief virtue, has been its director's camera consciousness, his understanding of the relative place and merits of impressionism and realism, his ability to suggest mood and regulate tempo. Duvivier is an interesting workman, rarely more interesting than here. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Little Carnegie"},{"year":"1940","title":"The British are not always easy to understand. Recently having given us a disillusioned film about medical orthodoxy in \\"The Citadel,\\" they now seem to be nudging us gently—possibly with tongue in cheek—toward the dangerous conclusion that there is something to be said for quackery, providing the Cagliostro in question is young, amusing and not too repulsive to be fallen in love with by his prettiest and richest patient. The thesis is either fascinatingly unconventional or else the final miraculous healing of Mary Maguire in \\"The Outsider,\\" at the Little Carnegie, is just another case of Materia Cinemedica, or Love Conquers All, in action.Heretical or not, \\"The Outsider\\" is pleasantly sugar-coated medicine, thanks mainly to George Sanders as the urbane bone surgeon who has a degree of self-assurance only, and to Miss Maguire as the glowing but crippled daughter of London's most celebrated surgeon. It seems that the entire British medical faculty have pronounced Miss Maguire incurable, and Mr. Sanders—although he has cured hundreds of helpless Cockneys with his electric massage machine—an impostor. The two are drawn together by Sanders's desire for publicity and by Miss Maguire's normal hankering for an athletic style worthy of an essentially unworthy, though public-school, fiancé.Students of theatrical therapy will understand that there can be only one issue to the one-year course of treatment mapped out by Dr. Sanders. His osteopathy may be slightly dubious, especially since it appears that he brings off his cures exactly on schedule, like the unveiling of a statue or the launching of a new destroyer, but his bedside manner is calculated to inspire the greatest confidence.

Perhaps it is because the events of these times have made such personal issues seem trivial, perhaps it is simply because it is so stiltedly written and produced, but the fact remains that for all its serious intentions, \\"It Happened to One Man\\" is threadbare theatrical fustian.It is the lugubrious and extended essay on an English financial charlatan, whose untimely exposure brings imprisonment for himself and disgrace to his family, and how after years of separation he turns honest to merit the belief of his son. But whatever the attempt at psychological revelation, it has been largely smothered under a series of banal situations, the acting of an inferior company, and a sound track which is often practically inaudible. Mr. Lawson alone conveys the suave ruthlessness of an entrepreneur who is not so much immoral as he is unmoral. It is his performance which lends a core of truth to a hackneyed film.

But a heap of effort seems to have been expended on a wispy story, which the scenarists, director and cast have the devil's own time in keeping from blowing away entirely. And the results barely justify all their straining.Jacques Becker, who directed and collaborated with Annette Wademant on the yarn, takes a tediously long time in developing the idea that his young couple—he is an as-yet-undiscovered piano virtuoso—are making the best of their marirage and that their love is strong despite an occasional spat. This charming existence is finally interrupted when our pair is invited to a soirée given by the bride's rich uncle, a party intended to show off her husband's talents to some rich, influential Parisians.Our hero finds he has no vest for his evening clothes, an item he is forced to borrow from her rich, playboy cousin, whom he hates. At the party another impasse causes him further embarrassment so that a divorce is imminent, but, as the saying goes, love—and a millionaire American, who gets him the recognition he needs—finally finds a way.As we were noting, the story is fragile, but Daniel Gelin and Anne Vernon, comparative newcomers to the American movie scene, endow the roles of the slightly embattled newlyweds with ebullience, charm and tenderness. William Tubbs, an American expatriate, who has been seen in several foreign-language films, including \\"Paisan,\\" is fine as the bluff millionaire, who recognizes Gelin's talents and ' is ready to minimize and spoof both his own and others' infidelities. Betty Stockfield and Elina LaBourdette are steadfastly gay as a pair of flirtatious wives and Jean Galland is properly prissy as the wealthy uncle.

It places a well-timed bomb under the pallid cult below Fourteenth Street, which will fight to the death for its right to believe that clean shirts and haircuts are incompatible with high-minded artistic expression.

In the Village they will very likely laugh it down","excerpt":"at the Mayfair audiences applauded some of the anti-art-for-art's-sake speeches. At any rate, \\"I Believed in You\\" is a lively and interesting entertainment.True Merrill, in the story, is a girl who believes passionately in what the neo-expressionists among her village friends appear to stand for. Michael Harrison, a wealthy dilettante, represents everything in the corrupt world of bourgeois art that she abhors. She has come to New York from a mining town, lured by the angry, prophetic words of the labor agitator with whom she is in love. Stung by Harrison's sarcastic references to her friends, she accepts his chiding offer to let him finance the group for six months. He maintains that they will not only fail to produce anything of value, but will be wanting in ordinary gratitude. After the six months, even her lover, who seems incorruptible, has shown himself to be small and mean. Broken, she herself sells a first novel, declines Harrison's offer of marriage and determines to go on by herself.The actors who participate in this parable are good and the direction successfully avoids the temptation to belabor the theme with facile burlesque. Rosemary Ames, a charming and talented newcomer, gives an affecting performance as the girl, and she is excellently assisted by Victor Jory as the agitator and John Boles as the dilettante.

With Miss Dunn reportedly in the grip of bronchitis, the Chicago-born soprano Kallen Esperian replaced her in the title role of Verdi's drama and gave a satisfactory if less than thrilling performance. Miss Esperian, who made her Met debut in 1989 as Mimi in \\"La Boheme,\\" has sung Luisa at La Scala and elsewhere in Europe. Furthermore, she must have felt comfortable with the evening's Rodolfo, Luciano Pavarotti. The Italian tenor has frequently appeared with her in operas and concerts since she was a winner of the Opera Company of Philadelphia/Luciano Pavarotti International Voice Competition in 1985.

The story revolves around the \\"miracle\\" town of Lourdes, at the foot of the Pyrénées, where the legend is that the Virgin Mary appeared in 1858 to a shepherd girl caught in a storm, since when the place has become a famous pilgrimage spot.Young Jean Bara is a French child actor worthy of the tradition established by Robert Lynan in \\"Poil de Carotte\\" and Paulette Elambert in \\"La Maternelle.\\" He dominates the scene from the very beginning, where he is shown as a boy of perhaps five or six years eagerly listening to the story of the vision at Lourdes told by an older playmate, through the excitement accompanying the accident that lames him, to the dramatic end when his faith, stimulated by a visit to the shrine, makes him walk again. The other actors are good, but what remains in the spectator's memory are the varying emotions reflected on Master Bara's sensitive features.The technique is excellent.

The story deals also with his new neighbor, Herr Ankerschmidt, a retired Austrian officer. Natural enemies at first, the two country gentlemen eventually become friends through the work of Eliz, the sprightly younger daughter of the Austrian, in getting Aladar pardoned by the Emperor and by their mutual struggle against a flood.Of course, complications are brought about by the machinations of a villainous spy and a heartless Magyar beauty before the happy end is reached.

Good acting by an excellent cast is also a contributing factor.The story is about the happy transplanting of a loving couple from Eger, small city, to the Hungarian capital. Gabor Korody, a talented young mechanical engineer, is engaged to the attractive Magda, but they cannot marry until he gets a job at something around 200 pengo a month. Their friend, a clownish drug clerk, sympathizes with them and rejoices when Magda, through a letter to Kalman Demeter, a friend of her family who is superintendent of an automobile factory in Budapest, gets the promise of a position for Gabor and they leave for the big city.Upon their arrival, Gabor bumps into Kalman at the station. Neither knows the other and a duel impends. After Gabor is employed in the factory the drug clerk arrives and substitutes for him whenever it is necessary to see the boss, with all sorts of comic results.

Perhaps American film makers are responsible, to a certain degree, for their Magyar colleagues' ideas about customs in the United States.This picture, directed for the Soltesz Kassay company by Laszlo Kardas, tells, with much conversation and little action, how the dashing Lili Muraty, as the daughter of a Budapest bank president, makes the acquaintance of one of her father's good-looking clerks (Lajos Basthy) by knocking him over with her car and finally marries him. But before the happy end he almost is caught by a rival charmer (Maria Mezey) and also makes a flying business trip to New York.

Then it dwells upon the rather lucky fate of one of the Cossack families who had sought refuge in Turkey.While the tragedy of the sons of the steppes is indicated, most of the incidents are humorous, as befits an operetta. Burly Michael Shvets is very amusing as the rather henpecked head of a family composed of his husky and comely wife and their pretty adopted daughter, Oxana. His adventures with the Sultan, who eventually provides the happy ending by saving Oxana's likely fiancé, Andrey, from execution and permitting the homesick Cossacks to return to their native land, are genuinely funny.Fine voices are displayed by the principals, including the aged bard who sings of the Ukraine's glory and sorrow. The chorus work is good and so are the dance numbers. The photography is clear as is the sound reproduction.At the Modern PlayhouseReminiscent of occasional stories from Soviet Russia telling of complications in matrimonial relationships when the housing shortage forces divorced couples to continue living in the same rooms is \\"Harapos Ferj\\" (Biting Husband), the new Budapest importation at the Modern Playhouse in Yorkville.

So he marries the attorney's stenographer (pretty Rozsi Barsony) and the fun begins in earnest.

Pretty Blanka Szombathelyi is very attractive as Eve's celluloid sister. The two lucky youths in the case, Imre Hamory and Imre Apathy, are cast as students in a forestry school, where play seems to beat work to a frazzle. While there is lots of action, there is no suspense. But the audience has a good time and plenty of laughs. This Photophon production was directed by Viktor Gertler.At the 86th Street CasinoMixing fact and fiction with skillful hands and making good use of two of Germany's best actors—Emil Jannings and Werner Krauss—the Tobis film folk have \\"glorified\\" (if anything like that be necessary) the memory of the discoverer of the bacillus of tuberculosis and at the same time put over a bit of Nazi propaganda.Herr Jannings does an excellent job, and has been kept under fine control by the director (Hans Steinhoff), in the title role of \\"Robert Koch,\\" just arrived at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre, two months after its première in Berlin. Herr Krauss also acts up to his reputation as Rudolf Virchow, the famous medical scientist and states man whose theories on the cause of tuberculosis were overturned by Koch's revolutionary discovery in 1882. As Professor Virchow was an opponent of despotic government and was a Liberal member of the Reichstag in Bismarck's day. he naturally is depicted as pretty much of an old fogy.Outstanding among the striking incidents in this serious and entertaining picture is the demonstration against Koch by the superstitious inhabitants of the rural district where he began his search for the death-dealing germ.

She is a secretary in love with her boss (Arpad Lehotay), a divorce lawyer with a 20-year-old daughter (the Wild Rose), whom he hasn't seen in a decade.When the Vadrozsa flees from the country to escape being forced into a loveless marriage by her maternal grandfather (Kalman Rozsahegyi) and lands in Budapest just in time for her father's birthday party, things begin to happen at a furious pace, the climax being reached with her release of her pet pig to the terror of a gay divorcee (Mariska Vizvary) eager to capture the noted attorney.

Ida Turay makes the daughter of the cranky widowed owner of the estate (Piri Vaszary) very appealing and Josef Juhasz does well as her \\"horse doctor\\" fiancé.

Carlos Villatoro is capable as the physician's artist nephew from the big city.Pleasant musical and dancing numbers help make this importation worth while.

Some of his stunts, however, are a little too strenuous to fit in with the general conception of Conan Doyle's amateur detective. The romantic interest is supplied by blond Trude Marlen.

Introducing that group on a 2004 album, ''Easy Living'' (ECM), Mr. Rava spotlighted a pair of rising stars, the trombonist Gianluca Petrella (who has since released a noteworthy Blue Note album) and the pianist Stefano Bollani (who recently left the quintet to tend to a solo career)","excerpt":"at the Montreal Jazz Festival last summer, he additionally showcased Francesco Cafiso, an alto saxophonist in his teens. Small wonder that Mr. Rava's influence will pervade a festival of Italian jazz at Birdland next week. His quintet appears on Thursday and next Friday, along with the pianist Enrico Pieranunzi (in a trio with the bassist Marc Johnson and the drummer Paul Motian, both Americans). Tuesday and Wednesday's program features ensembles led by the pianist Dado Moroni and the bassist Giovanni Tommaso, both close associates of Mr. Rava. And on April 1 and 2, Mr. Bollani and Mr. Cafiso will split the bill, leaving Mr. Rava's trumpet out of the mix but no doubt conveying some of his spirit.

It would indeed be a cold and distant heart that failed to respond to the homey philosophy and the tenderly sentimental vignettes of family life which are sketched with loving care and understanding by a knowing group of players in this beautifully made Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production.Yet it would not be an altogether unsympathetic heart that would murmur critically against some passages of the story which seem more contrived than natural. One could be the melodramatic adventure of the Jacobsons' 7-year-old daughter, Selma, and her younger cousin, Arnold, who set out to explore the spring-thaw flooded farm in a big galvanized bathtub and are swept into the raging river. Another objection might be made over the handling of the romance involving the pretty schoolmarm and the town's young newspaper editor. And there are times when those wonderful youngsters, Margaret O'Brien and Jackie (Butch) Jenkins, are just a bit more precocious than they have a right to be. But these are only minor annoyances and they most likely will be erased from most minds by the story's closing chapter.This is an eloquent and touchingly simple outpouring of the love in a little girl's heart for her less fortunate friends and it fills one with a warm glow as the picture fades out on the people of Fuller Junction. If you can watch Margaret O'Brien's ecstatic expression without emotion then \\"Our Vines Have Tender Grapes\\" was not meant for you. While this picture comes close at times to pathos, it is always skilfully rescued from the mawkish either by a line of humorous dialogue, of which Scenarist Dalton Trumbo has contributed several effective samples, or by the adroit handling of these situations by Roy Rowland. He has clipped many scenes in the nick of time.All of the joys and sorrows and the longings of a family bound by ties of blood and friendship with neighboring families are fondly studied by the camera during the four seasons we spend with the Jacobsons. Martinius, the father, has his heart set on building a new barn like the one Mr. Bjornson finally realized at the close of a lifetime, and when he assures Selma that her prayers might help, she says, with all the fervor and incomprehension of a 7-year-old, \\"Gosh! What's one more barn to God?\\"Edward G. Robinson is stolid and lovable as Martinius and in this role gives one of the finest performances of his long and varied screen career. Agnes Moorehead is altogether credible as the mother, and James Craig and Frances Gifford are quite pleasant as the young couple. But \\"Our Vines Have Tender Grapes\\" is mostly Mr. Robinson and those pint-sized mimes, who, on the whole, are remarkably natural. With that towhead and those freckles, Master Jenkins is above reproach. It is just unfortunate that this splendid entertainment had to arrive so near the end of the school vacation period, for the youngsters (not to overlook their elders) couldn't have asked for anything better.

But as a contrast to the bitter scenes of last September's tragedy accumulated in \\"Lights Out in Europe\\" it is a blessed relief.

Since the Renaissance, a painting has been thought of as a window on the world. This notion held sway until the late 19th century, when artists became motivated by the realization that the canvas is essentially a flat plane covered with colors. Paintings that are expressly about windows speak to the dynamic that is set up between the flat-plane aspect, which is the shape of the window echoing that of the canvas, and the illusion of looking out on the world.

If director Fellini makes it seem a little more urgent than it is, you may charge that off to his volatile disposition and a desire to make a stinging film.For he does certainly take a vigorous whiplash to the breed of over-grown and oversexed young men who hang around their local poolrooms and shun work as though it were a foul disease. He ridicules them with all the candor of his sharp neo-realist style, revealing their self-admiration to be sadly immature and absurd. And, without going into reasons for the slack state of these young men, he indicates that they are piteous and merit some sympathy, too.His hero in this sardonic picture, which actually was made before his tender and compassionate \\"La Strada,\\" now running in its fourth month at the Fifty-second Street Trans-Lux, is a vain and smirking Narcissus who, at the start, is forced to wed the sister of one of his companions. He has casually got her in a family way.But marriage does not bring him to a sense of responsibility. He continues to chase after women and act like an adolescent boy. So do his friends. They are children—big, hulking babies and cowards. They don't even have the nerve or the desperation to indulge in crime.Signor Fellini runs a fine line between gravity and burlesque in exposing the sleazy involvements and the grotesque behavior of these young men. At one moment, he is soberly musing with the brother of the girl who has to wed","excerpt":"at the next, he is showing him carousing with his irresponsible friends. From a comical scene of all the fellows listening to an old actor spout, he leaps to a shuddering revelation of the insidiousness of the old man. Signor Fellini loves to mirror the rapid shiftings in the human comedy.The weakness of this picture is that it reaches a weak conventional end. The bawdy hero forsakes his infidelities when his wife runs away from him, and the philosophical brother pulls himself together and leaves town to find a job. It seems as though Signor Fellini simply got tired and called it off.But when the drama is spinning, it is lively and interesting, and everybody in it does a commendable job. Franco Fabrizi is excellent as the plump, pretty, self-indulgent lad who has to marry, and Franco Interlenghi is quiet and and seemingly sensitive as his friend. Alberto Sordi, Leopoldo Trieste and Riccardo Fellini are eccentric as some of the boys, and Leonora Ruffo is pretty and appropriately banal as the girl.As usual, Signor Fellini uses music to comic and poignant effect. The dialogue that he and Ennio Flaiano have written is obviously more lively than the English subtitles that translate it.

Tardy, we say, because this picture, which has Diana Wynyard and Anton Walbrook in the roles that Miss Bergman and Mr. Boyer so handsomely adorned, was actually produced in England in 1940 and, after showing over there, was shelved to make way for \\"Gaslight\\" with its more popular personnel.Following the latter in this market, even by a space of eight years, \\"Angel Street\\" must bear some comparison—and that is not too good. For, made though it was in London, which is the natural locale of the tale, it appears to have less Victorian flavor than did the subsequent production of M.-G.-M. The street sets are plainly artificial, the atmosphere seems laboriously contrived and the direction of Thorold Dickinson is perceptibly casual and slow. Apparently Mr. Dickinson was working more for the mood of a psychological drama than an out-and-out thriller, which this tale is.In the role of the diabolic husband who has the smart way for torturing his wife, Mr. Walbrook is malefically haughty—but just a bit too much so. And Miss Wynyard, while beautiful and gracious as the wife whom he is slowly driving mad, appears a little too healthy and composed for a woman on the verge. Frank Pettingell as a kind detective, Cathleen Cordell as a brazen maid and Minnie Rayner as an elderly domestic are competent in their roles.As a token of the oldness of this picture, Robert Newton appears in a virtual \\"bit,\\" looking very youthful and determined.

But the picturization with music, which set up shop yesterday at the Park Avenue Theatre, treating of the career of one George Howard as inspired by the memory of Georges Edwardes is far from inspired. And that producer's story from the gaslit Nineties to 1919 seems a fairly static and conventional concoction composed largely and anomalously of tough breaks conquered by the luck of the Irish. Mr. Edwardes' record, to judge by this English film record, is a loving but lethargic tale no better or worse than the dozens of leisurely and familiar musical biographies which have emerged from Hollywood's film factories.The plot, as has been noted, has a ring of familiarity. It has to do with a brash young man fresh from the old sod who comes to London with great hopes and very little cash and who gets control of a seedy music hall and turns out a musical comedy hit when the chips are down and nearly out. He goes on to win the leading lady and eventually becomes the town's leading impresario. Obviously to prove this wasn't as simple as it sounds, the producers have fitted a variety of bricks into this framework to point up facets in the indomitable man's career. Included among them are his championship of a ruined chorus girl to the point where he is nearly bankrupt, a snide newspaper critic who is forever digging up and printing damaging yarns about the badgered producer and the loss of his health and his son during the war. But these episodes, sadly enough, merely prolong and do not add much luster to the proceedings.Richard Greene is handsome and forthright as Howard but the scant acting honors of the piece go to Ann Todd, as his wife, who valiantly aids him through hits and near misses. Leni Lynn contributes a pleasing performance as one of his sprightly musical discoveries, while Peter Graves is on the wooden side as Greene's journalistic nemesis. None of the performances, it might be added, attain the stature of Walter Hampden's superb rendition of excerpts from \\"Cyrano de Bergerac\\" in a short subject of that name which is included on the program.

Juan Manual Rosas, the dictator who temporarily united Argentina at the cost of rivers of blood and who dominated the country until his decisive defeat in 1852, was still the idol of the gauchos at the time of the picture, which accounts for the loyalty of Muiño, as a typical rural chief, to the Federalists, in spite of his personal friendship with Orestes Caviglia, as a bandit-patriot.With its ox-cart caravan and its desert setting, \\"Huella\\" (\\"Trail\\"), now at the Radio Teatro Hispano, is slightly reminiscent of \\"The Covered Wagon.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Radio Teatro Hispano"},{"year":"1940","title":"In \\"Alas de mi Patria\\" (My Country's Wings), now at the Radio Teatro Hispano, Argentina presents a picture of its development of military aviation from the first flight from Buenos Aires to Montevideo in 1910 to the recent good-will tour of Ibero America by an Argentine Army officer. At times it seems as if Carlos Borcosque, who directed this C. A. film, were trying to show the improvement in cinematography as well, so varied is the technique.Enrique Muiño is excellent as the sergeant who takes the blame for the death of a lieutenant killed on a forbidden attempt to fly over the Andes to Santiago de Chile, but who lives to see his own son (Pablo Palitos) hailed as Argentina's crack aviator and himself rehabilitated. There is just about the proper mixture of air drama, humor and romance, the latter being supplied by Delia Garces and Melisa Zini, both decidedly attractive, each in her own way.

To tell the truth, there is little drama in this rather placid unreeling of the life of a middle-class family of Buenos Aires from just after the turn of the century, when the tango was still under the ban and the word \\"Socialist\\" was enough to frighten the \\"bourgeoisié\\", until right down to last year.But the work of Enrique Muiño, as the head of the family, and that of Sabina Olmos, as the eldest daughter separated from Arturo Garcia Buhr because of political and religious differences, largely compensates for the lack of excitement and covers up some of the technical defects.

For in this prestimably perfect demonstration of prime physical attractions and repulisions, two of the screen's most potential—Virginia Bruce and Mary Astor—crash head-on. And, honestly, you can hardly hear the thud.The minor catastrophe occurs when Herbert Marshall, on a judicial visit to Washington, meets and makes Miss Bruce his second wife and takes her back to his home town, where Miss Astor, his first, is prepared to give stubborn resistance. And this she obviously does, by holding out with Mr. Marshall's little daughter and by trying to turn the whole small town against her blissful successor. But the resistance of Miss Astor is so patent and the attack of Miss Bruce so uninspired that, finally—after a feeble attempt by Miss Bruce to drive her rival off—the whole thing is apparently called a draw. And Mr. Marshall settles back with a sigh.If any one rises to protest that the present is not a fair test case—that Miss Bruce is neither irresistible nor Miss Astor otherwise—no exception will be taken in this quarter. But both, in this instance, are rather ponderous. And so, for that matter, is the picture. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Rialto"},{"year":"1938","title":"Haunted house murders.

The crook in this case, whose specialty is the pilfering of art treasures in Mexico City, turns out, of course to be the fellow you would never in the world suspect—providing you had never seen a movie, that is—and the hero, naturally open to suspicion, is ultimately revealed as a big New York detective.That's the sort of obvious picture this one is, so you needn't anticipate any shattering surprises.

It breezes along at a smooth pace, and the climactic plight is neatly laced with good old comedy. List it as second-grade detective fiction, but good enough as such.At the Teatro LatinoThe complete justification for the Rodriguez Hermanos production \\"Viviré Otra Vez\\" (\\"I Shall Live Again\\"), now at the Teatro Latino, is Alice de Phillip. As the crippled daughter of wealthy parents (Miguel Arenas and Aurora Walker) whose love for her foster brother (David Silva) not only saves him from sacrificing himself for his unworthy foster brother (Ramon Armengod) but enables her to walk again, Señorita de Phillip holds the sympathetic interest of the audience every minute she is on the screen. Adriana Lamar is effective in the role of the unfortunate mother obliged to abandon her infant. Other able Mexican players in the big cast are Joaquin Pardavé, Manolo Noriega, Joaquin Cosa and Carlos Moctezuma. The director was Roberto Rodriguez.

It is the story of a Finnish troop defending a mountaintop which is being mined by Russian sappers, and more particularly of the reactions of several former Olympic skiers in the contending forces. Obviously it is a copy—and a woefully inferior one—of \\"The Doomed Battalion\\" (1932), which placed an Austrian troop in a similar predicament while fighting against Italian attackers in the Alps during the first World War.Except for a few stock shots of skiers chasing down snowy slopes, the whole picture has the unmistakable artificiality of a studio-made rush job. The manifest irony of former sports rivals fighting one another to the death is given no more than platitudinous point. And the melodramatic action, which should have been tense and exciting, is limp and laboriously contrived. The heroic defense of the Finns certainly deserves a better cinema memorial than this.

And, surprising though it may seem, the six bounding Herberts were almost lost in the shuffle—or scuffle. The consequence is an ordinary little musical picture which has some hilarious moments when Mr. Herbert, either singly or en masse, is bulging around on the screen, but which is rather dull when he is not.

Vincent Price, though a bit hard to get into the camera field vertically, seems a likely screen hero, and there is no particular point in continuing to be snobbish toward Miss Constance Bennett just because she was the nation's favorite example of the way Hollywood overpays screen actresses back in the darkest days of the depression. (She was the $35,000-a-week girl—remember?)Incidentally, any single film which enjoys the combined services of Charlie Ruggles, Helen Broderick, Mischa Auer and Joy Hodges is bound to be a lively affair, no matter if the lines occasionally are on the dullish side and the humor at times seems a bit prankish. The story is that Miss Bennett, who runs an all-service bureau, is sent up-State to prevent somebody's inventive nephew from entering New York, falls in love with him on the night boat (if the Day Line will pardon us), seems about to lose him to Joy Hodges and then has to marry him herself when Joy decides to elope with Mischa Auer. That's positively all there is to it except of course for the prankish padding.At the Chopin TheatreThe moral of \\"Dyplomatyczna Zona,\\" the Polski Tobis film at the Chopin Theatre, is that if a fine young man in the Polish diplomatic service (Alexander Zabczynski) is honest with his secret actress wife and doesn't yield to the charms of an ardent widow (L.

WORLD'S LONLIEST LITERATURE"},{"year":"1999","title":"Mommy Dressing: A Love Story, After a Fashion   By Lois Gould. Anchor, $12.95.    The daughter of a glamorous dress designer tells how she grew up starved for affection but hypnotized by her mother's elegance and solipsism. ''What is so extraordinary'' about this memoir is that it ''makes us feel the helplessness, the awful emotional ignorance and deprivation that made her mother who she was, as a parent and as a woman,'' Margo Jefferson wrote here last year.     A Man in Full   By Tom Wolfe. Bantam, $8.50.    The twin tales of a white Atlanta real estate mogul hurtling toward ruin and a black football star accused of raping a white woman converge in a wild, sprawling narrative crammed with the author's zestful reporting on the ins and outs of the modern South. ''The novel contains passages as powerful and as beautiful as anything written not merely by contemporary American novelists but by any American novelist,'' Michael Lewis wrote in the Book Review last year. ''The book is as funny as anything Wolfe has ever written","excerpt":"at the same time it is also deeply, strangely affecting.''     The Night Club Era   By Stanley Walker. Johns Hopkins University, $17.95.    This popular history of Manhattan during Prohibition was written by the city editor of The New York Herald Tribune when the Volstead Act was a fresh memory, and its pages are jumping with bootleggers, celebrities, swindlers, speak-easy owners and assorted tough guys and politicians. ''It is vivid but accurate, thoroughly informed, and it moves at a smart pace,'' Robert Van Gelder wrote in these pages in 1933. The same publisher has reissued City Editor ($17.95), an insider's view of a big-city newsroom and 1930's newspaper journalism. ''Walker's learned essays on freedom of the press, libel, editing, the varieties of reporting experience and other topics . . . give the book body,'' C. G. Poore said here in 1934. ''Style and stories give it flavor and bouquet.''     The Wall   By John Marks. Riverhead, $14.    In his first novel, an American journalist follows a large cast of spies, expats and traitors whose lives are complicated by the fall of the Berlin wall. ''The story is captivating and reminds us that although each side of the cold war was guided by strategy . . . it was still a time of individual choices,'' Charles Norchi wrote here in 1998.     The Restraint of Beasts   By Magnus Mills. Scribner, $11.    This darkly humorous first novel revolves around three slacker fence builders and drinking buddies in Scotland forced to deal with a growing number of deadly work-related accidents. The result is ''a witty, intricate fable about a working-class hell constructed by its own inhabitants,'' Anthony Bourdain wrote here last year.     The Search for the Giant Squid   By Richard Ellis. Penguin, $14.95.    Zoology's last grand mystery is the giant squid, which lives in the deep ocean and can grow to 60 feet. In fact, it has rarely, if ever, been seen alive, and little is known of its hunting and breeding habits. Ellis tells what we do know, and can surmise, and his account ''will send a shiver down your spine, the kind of shiver from which squid mania is born,'' Laura Miller wrote here in 1998. In Imagining Atlantis (Vintage, $13), Ellis wades through thousands of years of myth about the legendary lost continent and the legions of quasi historians and mystics who have weighed in. After reviewing the geological and archeological evidence, he concludes that Plato made it all up. Last year our reviewer, Robert Eisner, called this ''an entertaining, thorough yet readable account.''     No Lease on Life   By Lynne Tillman. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $12.    This novel records a day in the life of a streetwise proofreader whose revenge on the crazies and operators on her New York City block pales in comparison to her violent fantasies. ''It dramatizes what the city that never sleeps can do to a tough, smart, but no longer quite so resilient woman,'' David Gates wrote here last year.     Isaiah Berlin: A Life   By Michael Ignatieff. Owl/Holt, $16.    In this authorized biography, the celebrated liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin (1909-97) is portrayed as having lived a charmed life in which the three strands of his existence -- Jewish, Russian and British -- were richly interwoven. ''The result is a touching portrait,'' Steven Marcus said here last year. ''It gives us a rounded view of an extraordinarily distinguished mind.''     If I Don't Six   By Elwood Reid. Anchor, $12.95.    The hero of this first novel is a 275-pound offensive lineman from a blue-collar family who's not sure he wants to get ground up in the brutal and brutalizing machine of big-time college football. ''In muscular prose, with appealing imagery . . . 'If I Don't Six' is by turns funny, insightful, sad,'' Ira Berkow wrote here in 1998.     The Giant, O'Brien   By Hilary Mantel. Marian Wood/Owl/Holt, $12.    In 18th-century Britain, a huge Irish dreamer who hawks himself as a sideshow curiosity crosses paths with a mad scientist with an insatiable appetite for dissection. Last year our reviewer, Walter Kendrick, admired the novel's ''careful period setting, its spare, elegant prose and its stretches of wistful fantasy as the giant spins his tales.''

The idea that a so-called 'wellness\\" model of health care will contain rising costs is inherently flawed, for it ignores a most important question: what happens when the people who have benefited from this approach eventually do become sick - as many will - or become old - as virtually all must? Will they just die as a matter of convenience, and save us the trouble of spending money on their care?    The article also states that we must move to a consumer-focused system that puts the needs of the patients at the forefront. But what, after all, is a patient? This is the fallacy of the entire \\"wellness\\" approach: well people do not need health care, except in a very minor way. Those who really require the attention of the health care system are those who have become ill - and their need is to be made well again. More often than not, this costs money.    The current debate over the adoption of preventive health care strategies is really about a much larger political issue: to what extent will we commit our limited resources to caring for the old and the sick, as opposed to other pressing social problems? We are already beginning to answer the question in subtle ways.    For example, drug abuse - formerly considered to be a behavioral and social problem - has now been classified as a \\"disease.\\" Many health plans will now pay for costly drug-abuse treatment","excerpt":"at the same time people with cancer and other serious illnesses are having to do battle with their insurance companies - sometimes in court - to obtain payment for needed therapies. Even those with lesser health problems are having to struggle with ever-increasing deductibles, co-payments, etc.    Yes, our health care system needs overhaul, and yes, let's do it in a way that's just as equitable. But let's not be misled. Some onerous choices will have to be made, and shifting from a \\"sickness\\" to a \\"wellness\\" approach is not going to get us off the hook - either morally or financially. Robert A.

The United States narrowly succeeded in delaying a vote on the measure over the weekend.   The delay has given Washington more time to try to change the proposed resolution. American diplomats oppose it because they believe its passage would weaken their demand that President Saddam Hussein unconditionally withdraw his troops from Kuwait","excerpt":"at the same time, American efforts to resist the measure are complicated by a reluctance to allow a wedge to be driven between Washington and its Arab allies in the gulf crisis.     In its current form, the resolution would give United Nations protection to Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied territories. It also endorses a plan to convene an international Middle East peace conference to resolve the region's problems at an unspecified future date.

Since memory is selective, the reasons for these lapses tell us as much about the state of the medium as do the current fashions.   Before his untimely death in 1976 at age 50, Charles Pratt was a well-known and widely published landscape photographer. His detailed renditions of the natural world were admired for revealing, with economy and delicacy, a phenomenological order of spiritual import.  Even when his subject was a mere lump of dirt in a field, he could imbue it with significance. What makes his death seem especially untimely today is that he was, at mid-career, still getting better, still refining his craft and vision in formally innovative ways.

Its medieval cities survive, intact, unchanged and quite as lively as ever, but in the course of a 50-year French protectorate its people learned a second language so that someone unfamiliar with Arabic can still manage. It is one of the oldest kingdoms in the world and remains, despite its constitution, a well-nigh absolute monarchy. But even those ancient customs seem young compared to the span of the country's history: Morocco, today, offers a fascinating blend of cultures placed in a variety of beautiful landscapes.   There is, of course, much to be seen there, from the Sahara in the South to Tangier in the north, but one city in particular offers a unique series of contrasts.

Schoenberg's strict method, ordering the 12 pitches of the scale in nonrepeating atonal rows, was exhilarating therapy for composers beset by a multiplicity of stylistic choices.

It is for this reason that \\"Black Sea Fighters,\\" the Russian documentary at the Stanley, is remarkable. As the story of the siege of Sevastopol and the naval operations incident to its defense, the film has escaped the monotony of repeating the details of a familiar war. Although it begins as quite an ordinary record it gathers force and excitement as it moves. With commentary by Clifford Odets, which is excellent for its restraint, and is spoken by Fredric March with an equal regard for the eloquence of the film itself, \\"Black Sea Fighters\\" surges forward to re-create the din, the agony, the glory of those immense days.Beginning with scenes of bombardment, of routine operations ashore and at sea, the film shows the Russian fleet in action during a \\"commando\\" raid upon the enemy-held coast near the naval base. It records a naval bombardment of German shore installations and the slight damage inflicted upon the ships during the duel of heavy guns. After that \\"Black Sea Fighters\\" moves rapidly into the intensity of battle in the grim final days, the smoke of the guns and explosions swirling over the prone defenders, tanks pouring their dragon's breath of liquid fire into enemy machine-gun nests, a soldier cursing a jammed gun, the white plumes of shell bursts rising around and in the city in these latter scenes, the film generates a good deal of the heat and excitement of battle.But in itself that is no longer sufficient to distinguish a factual record. The Russians, no less than the English, have learned that it is the minor and often fragile detail that stamps out clearest the agony of war. The moving things in \\"Black Sea Fighters\\" are, not remarkably, the small things—the fine young face of a soldier intense in battle or thoughtful over a guitar between the battles, of people enjoying the calmer days as though no enemy were at the gates. Strangely, trees blossomed amid the chaos and there were fresh flowers to lay upon the new graves of those who had died in that same inferno. Even in its death, Sevastopol had a terrible kind of beauty. Its ruins with the occasional slim columns of brick and stone seemed classic amid the silent sunlit rubble.\\"Black Sea Fighters,\\" on the whole, has more than ordinary excitements. But it is in the unobtrusive human details that it often touches the heart of a great and rending drama. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Stanley"},{"year":"1944","title":"\\"Adventure in Bokhara,\\" the Tashkent picture with English titles which came to the Stanley Theatre Saturday, is a broad, almost farcical picturization of some of the exploits of the legendary Nasredin. This picaresque character, a sort of Turkoman Robin Hood, weaves in and out of one scrape after another with the tyrannical Emir of Bokhara and, as must be expected, always comes out one head ahead of the dull-witted ruler and his duller-witted neck hackers.Lev Sverdlin, in the starring role, makes a jolly rogue and quite possibly is a competent actor, although this particular picture calls for not much more than the most rudimentary miming. Neither does M. Mirzakarimova, a Tartar beauty and the romantic angle of the piece, have much to do but walk Orientally about.The picture, actually produced in the Uzbek Republic of the U.S.S.R., has distinct travelogue value in its Bokhara and surrounding territory scenes and its authentic picturization of Asiatic Russian costumes and customs.

After the picture's initial sequences, the misunderstandings, despite the excellent English subtitles, become as tedious and transparent as the plot of a static musical comedy.Valentina Serova, as a mathematician and author of a serious treatise titled \\"Normal Curve of Distribution,\\" disapproves of her younger sister's mooning over a handsome lieutenant. But though Miss Serova succumbs, irrationally, to the lieutenant's charms and strives to portray properly a love-smitten maiden, she succeeds generally in acting like the author of \\"Normal Curve of Distribution.\\" Eugene Samoilov, as the dashing officer, and Ludmilla Tselikovskaya, as the sister, handle their assignments easily and with feeling, although a minimum of histrionics is required of them.

Five fugitives from a penal settlement in the Pacific jump out of the frying pan into the fire by landing on an islet where they are targets for the arrows of unseen natives who have the habit of wrapping up their victims and preserving them as mummies. Carlo, the leader of the fugitives, finally brings help in the persons of the guards sent in their pursuit, and the likely young couple (Javier and Maria) learn that their flight was unnecessary as a telegram had arrived the night of the escape to the effect that Javier had been proved innocent of the murder for which he had been condemned. But as the party is leaving with a box filled with gold and jewels, found in a mysterious cave, poor Carlo is pierced with an arrow, leaving Javier and Maria as the only survivors of the five.While this film is fairly good from the mechanical side, the action is slow and the attempt to create an atmosphere of suspense and horror falls flat.

It is outdated by being timed during the last months of the dry era and dealing with the activities of bootleggers instead of policy racketeers and the like.As just another comedy romance, the tale of the handsome young Spaniard (Ramon Pereda) of good family, driven by hard luck to becoming a gangster and finally redeemed through the love of a cabaret singer (Adriana Lamar) and his brother's nobility and courage, is quite acceptable and provides considerable entertainment. Considering the subject, the acting of all concerned is effective and remarkably restrained. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Campoamor."},{"year":"1935","title":"Let no one think that the valiant deed performed by the popular Mexican screen actor Ramon Pereda in \\"El Heroe de Nacozari,\\" the current offering at the Teatro Campoamor, has anything to do with the numerous affairs in which so many of his countrymen have shown their disdain of death on the field of battle or before the firing squad.This time the Mexican producers have turned out a film of civic heroism based on an incident said to have occurred a few years ago in Nacozari, Sonora, when a freight engineer hauled a burning car of dynamite to a safe distance from the town before it blew him into eternity. A railroad picture, from start to finish, this importation gives a good idea of the lives and loves of the rail workers, and the combination of desert and mountain which is Northern Mexico.It is too bad that the excellent performance of the principals and their supporters is heavily handicapped at times by poor photography and sound reproduction.

When it is learned that this heritage is going to a young and passably good-looking niece of the poet living in Barcelona and, furthermore, that the proprietor of the Buenos Aires cabaret (the popular comedian Rafael Arcos) advances the money necessary to establish the son's claims in the Spanish courts, the spectators can see just what is bound to happen.Technically this picture is inferior to some others sent over from Spain recently. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Campoamor."},{"year":"1935","title":"The nascent talking picture industry of Barcelona has lost no time in showing the world that it has little regard for the sentimental melodramatic scenarios used in so many of the Spanish-language films.With a lack of subtlety likely to shock a director of the Josef von Sternberg type, Señor Benito Perojo has taken the well-known subject of the noble but misunderstood and hounded, escaped prisoner and turned out a merry burlesque, now at the Teatro Campoamor under the title of \\"Se ha Fugado un Preso\\" (A Prisoner Has Escaped). Juan de Landa is excellent as the burly fugitive, who, with his poor, motherless daughter (Rosita Diaz), rallies the steerage passengers to his defense when the officers of a liner try to apprehend him, expels the first-class passengers from the dancing salon, strips off most of their clothing and becomes boss of the ship.So that nothing will be missing, there is a handsome, rich and bored youth (Señor Nunez), whose interest in life is revived by the sight of the prisoner's rather attractive child. A high spot in this amusing effort is the solemn reception accorded to the supposed \\"Excellency\\" when his ship touches at the kingdom of Sylvania. Unfortunately, the photography and sound reproduction leave much to be desired. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Campoamor."},{"year":"1935","title":"Continuing his work of burlesquing the highly sentimental films turned out by Spanish and Mexican studios in such profusion a short time ago, Benito Perojo has made an amusing semi-slapstick comedy out of \\"Susana tiene un secreto\\" (Susana Has a Secret), the latest Barcelona screen effort to reach the Teatro Campoamor.Taking as his subject the theme used by Bellini in his famous opera \\"La Sonnambula\\" more than a century ago, Director Perojo has a sleep-walking bride get into the room of a stranger just before her wedding day and be driven to desperation by her own subsequent suspicions. In the first couple of reels the audience is rather inclined to take the romance seriously, but then the mood of the action changes and the comic situations come so thick and fast that the director's purpose becomes obvious and the rest of the time is spent in laughing at the quirks with which the picture is so well supplied.Rosita Diaz is very attractive as the heroine and Ricardo Nuñez is efficient as her naval officer. By locating the action at a Spanish seashore resort being visited by a cruiser the director has added much to the optical charm of the comedy.

With a little improvement on the mechanical side and with scenarios more up to date, Spanish-made films may become formidable competitors of those from Mexico.While most of the interest attaches to the sentimental songs of Señorita Aubert and Señor Morel, there is excellent comedy work by Señor Arcos, as the always optimistic leader of the troupe, and Señorita Colomer in the rôle of a saucy housemaid.

Furthermore, in contrast to most Mexican pictures, everybody is happy in the end, except a crooked former fighter who goes back to jail where he belongs.Raul Talan, the youth of parentage unknown to all but the spectators until the final reels, battles his way to the welterweight championship of the republic in a manner that suggests that he may have merely taken time out to help glorify his profession. Maria Luisa Zea is as attractive as usual in the rôle of the girl of good family who scorns social conventions for love of the game young man who turns out to be the son of the famous trainer, an old friend of her father.The acting is competent throughout and the technique is generally good.

You see Lupita, orphaned owner of a big ranch, as the childhood sweetheart of José, an officer in the army of the revolution. When his best friend, the handsome Captain Felipe, meets her, it is a case of love at first sight. Not until near the end of the play do the loyal comrades learn that they are rivals. The finish is not as tragic as in most Mexican pictures of the same category, but it hardly would do for Hollywood.The acting is generally good, as is the technique.

Adriana Lamar makes Irma both attractive and repellent, at the proper moments, while Maria Luisa Zea is appealing as the secretary whose love for the attorney eventually consoles him for the tragic loss of his wife and child.The other members of the cast are competent, and the technique of the film is passable.

A cousin of the profligate and brutal Duke Alessandro, who was assassinated in 1537, Lorenzino hesitates between loyalty to his family and love for the beautiful Bianca, daughter of Filippo Strozzi, head of the rival clan.Love wins in the end and Lorenzino and Bianca make their escape to Venice, after having lured the lustful Duke to death at the hands of Michaele, a young officer whose sweetheart, Nella, had been one of Alessandro's victims. Presumably most of the story is fanciful, but as Duke Alessandro really met a violent end, the scenarist has built a highly entertaining and colorful tale upon a foundation of fact.Magnificently mounted and acted by a cast apparently inspired by the work of their leader, \\"Lorenzino de' Medici\\" is a credit to the rejuvenated Italian film industry. English titles explain the action. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Cine-Roma"},{"year":"1937","title":"A joy to both the eye and the ear is \\"Casta Diva,\\" a new Italian film at the Broadway Cine-Roma, telling the romanticized film story of the frustrated love affair between Vincenzo Bellini and Maddalena Fumaroli in Naples in 1825. Persons acquainted with the brief and hectic life of the great Sicilian composer will forgive Carmine Gallone, the director, for the liberties he has taken with facts in order to make a musical and photographic holiday.Martha Eggerth, the blonde Magyar-German actress, is lovely enough to justify the notion that she was the inspiration for \\"Casta Diva,\\" the aria largely responsible for the popularity of the opera \\"Norma,\\" and her singing of several minor pieces is pleasing. Sandro Palmieri is just the type to portray a dreamy, unworldly young musician and he does it very effectively. The acting is first-rate throughout, with special credit due to Lamberto Picasso, as Judge Fumaroli, and Gualtiero Tumiati in the role of Paganini.There is so much delightful music by Rossini, Paganini and Bellini and so many charming scenes in and around Naples and Milan that even those unfamiliar with Italian are sure to enjoy this picture.

But Vilma Vidal, a recent recruit for the Mexican studios from Argentina, plays well and is quite attractive.

In a minor Mexican production, written and directed by Antonio Helu for the Lux Films, the popular snub-nosed comedian Leopoldo Ortin burlesques a plainclothes man, while the handsome J. J. Martinez Casado solves the murder mystery à la Sherlock Holmes. Alicia Ortiz adds decoration to \\"The Obligation to Assassinate,\\" and several other capable Mexican actors contribute to the entertainment. The persistent note of comedy robs the triple murder of its gruesomeness, and the dénouement is likely to surprise most of the spectators. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Hispano"},{"year":"1937","title":"An amusing little Mexican film called \\"No Te Engañes, Corazon\\" (Don't Fool Thyself, Heart) is the feature of the bill at the Teatro Hispano this week. Directed and produced by Miguel Contreras Torres, it is a variation of the old theme of the henpecked husband. In the face of imminent death he finally asserts himself and winds up monarch of all he surveys. The heart problem is medical, rather than sentimental.When the faithful old bookkeeper (excellently played by Carlos Orellana) is told that he may drop dead any moment, he decides to die happy. Before he learns that the doctor is a quack, he has made the rounds of the night clubs, put his wife (Sara Garcia) in her place, engaged their rather attractive daughter (Natalia Ortiz) to the man of her choice, unmasked an office crook (Manuel Buendia) and won $10,000 in a lottery. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Hispano"},{"year":"1937","title":"The best justification for the presence of \\"La Gran Cruz\\" (The Heavy Cross) on the screen of the Teatro Hispano is that this Mexican-made picture gives Harlem audiences another chance to admire the beauty and ability of Elena d'Orgaz. The simple dignity and sincerity with which this slim, attractive brunette plays the part of the fiancée of a soldier, who is suddenly called to the front and compelled to leave her in a delicate condition, are worthy of note, especially when compared with the usual overacting in similar cases.Joaquin Busquets, as the soldier who is reported dead but returns just when his brother (René Cardona) has married his fiancée, also does good work. The story, however, is pretty routine, and Rafael Sevilla, the director, seems to have fumbled the ending. After the audience hears the shot supposed to indicate suicide as the proper solution of the dilemma, the blinded soldier is shown in a rather prolonged parting from the heroine and their little boy before fading away into space. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Hispano"},{"year":"1937","title":"\\"El Baul Macabro,\\" the current Spanish-language picture at the Teatro Hispano, was directed by Miguel Zacarias for the Ezet production concern of Mexico, D. F., but it might just as well have been turned out any place else. For, while the cast includes such excellent actors as Ramon Pereda, René Cardona, Manuel Noriega and Carlos Lopez and such attractive girls as Esther Fernandez and Juanita Castro, this \\"Macabro Trunk\\" really holds only an old bag of tricks.From the very first the audience knows that Ramon Pereda, crazed by the sufferings of an invalid wife, is the \\"mysterious\\" doctor seeking to cure her by transfusion of the blood of the young women whose disappearance has the police and press by the ears. Consequently, the only interest is in how Señor Cardona is going to save his fiancée from the clutches of his fellow surgeon. The pace is fast and there are so many funny incidents that the sought-for gruesome atmosphere is seldom realized. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Hispano"},{"year":"1938","title":"There is nothing new in the thesis that more than just bearing children is needed to make a real mother, but rarely has it been presented on the screen in such an entertaining form as in \\"No Basta Ser Madre\\" (Motherhood Is Not Enough), now at the Teatro Hispano. Avoiding the mushiness frequently found in films turned out on the other side of the Rio Grande, this Mexican-made picture, with its locale in Madrid and a small Spanish village, has the proper mixture of humor, sentiment and common sense.Sara Garcia, as the middle-aged woman who adopts an unwanted baby left at a convent by its scandalized grandmother (Clementina Morin) and lavishes genuine mother love upon it, is the leading protagonist. Her acting is excellent, only being equaled by that of Carlos Orellana, in the role of the country alcalde whose wisecracks and dispensation of justice keep the audience amused most of the time. Miguel Arenas is fine as her unlettered husband with a heart of gold. Good actors take the parts of the younger people, but they are merely \\"props\\" for the principals.There are many interesting rural scenes, with some music and dancing. Ramon Peon directed the film for the V. Saiso Piquer Company with a sure hand.Because it has been delayed twenty-four hours in its return East, the Helsinki University Chorus will have to hurry to make all its connections today. It arrives from the West at 4:55 P. M., and will have to connect with a train that leaves at 5 P.

The ensemble will return to New York for a final concert in the evening at Carnegie Hall. The group will sail for England later in the week. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Hispano"},{"year":"1938","title":"Rather interesting scenes in the stockyards of Buenos Aires and in what probably is a typical hamlet in the Argentine cattle country compensate to some degree for the technical faults of \\"Loco Lindo,\\" an Argentine Sono Film production, directed by Arturo Mom, now at the Teatro Hispano. There are a few pleasing songs, one of which is the reason for the picture's name, roughly translated as \\"Crazy Dandy.\\" And, of course, at couple of tangos.As Carmencita, a country maiden lured to the big city by a rascal engaged in changing the brands of stolen live stock, Sofia Bozan acts well and is good to look at. Luis Sandrini, a popular Argentine comedian, makes a sympathetic figure of Miguelito, a clerk in the village store who goes to Buenos Aires in search of Carmencita, finds her, runs down the gang of stockyard crooks and is rewarded by her hand and the applause of the whole town. The romance is secondary to the slapstick funny business.Benefit Performance TonightA theatre party for the Palestine Lighthouse is taking all seats for tonight's performance of \\"Three Waltzes.\\" Parties arranged by the Drama League of New York are seeing \\"Susan and God\\" at the Plymouth this evening and tomorrow afternoon—reserving only a part of the house, however. \\"Susan\\" is playing a special performance next Sunday night for the Stage Relief Fund. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Hispano"},{"year":"1938","title":"If the New York censors had cut still more out of \\"Supremo Sacrificio\\" (\\"Supreme Sacrifice\\"), the current film at the Teatro Hispano, it would have made little difference from almost any point of view, as this ancient bit of celluloid sentimentality is about the poorest thing in the line of alleged entertainment that has reached here from Mexico. Its argument is practically the same as that of \\"Nobody's Wife,\\" a Mexican production shown in Harlem not long ago, only this time the poor girl who brings discord into the life of a group of bohemian artists goes away with one of them instead of committing suicide. The main players are pretty Josefina Escobedo, Julian Soler, Victor Urruchua and Lorenzo Barcelata. Chano Urueta directed the piece, which is being distributed by Producciones Monterrey. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Hispano"},{"year":"1939","title":"In making \\"La Vida es un Tango\\" (Life is a Tango), the new Argentine picture at the Teatro Hispano, the Lumiton's scenarist compounded just about the right mixture of humor, song and pathos. Manuel Romero, the director, keeps the company of able players moving from the beginning, in 1903, of this ninety-minute sketch of the high spots of the development of the Argentine tango music to its highly sentimental happy ending thirty years later.During this time Hugo del Carril, a handsome young man with a good voice, sings a number of popular tangos, supported by the comely and \\"simpatica\\" Lubina Olmos. Although the younger people act well, the histrionic honors of this musical melodrama go to the veteran, Florencio Parraviccini, and to Tito Luciardo, as the doting fathers of the couple, \\"meant for each other,\\" but separated for most of the time by the usual film obstacles. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Hispano"},{"year":"1939","title":"\\"Vamonos con Pancho Villa\\" (Let's Go With Pancho Villa), now at the Teatro Hispano, probably is the most authentic semi-historical picture covering incidents in the recent Mexican civil war ever turned out on either side of the Rio Grande.Strange to say, however, although Domingo Soler is entirely credible as the famous revolutionary and guerrilla chief, the acting honors go to Antonio R. Frausto. Never before has this excellent player so captured his audience as in his representation of the leader of a group of six ranchers who join Villa in order to help avenge the murder of Francisco Madero and overthrow the reactionary forces. Of course, Francisco de Fuentes, as the director of this CLASA production, is also entitled to credit for building the action up to a crisis where Señor Frausto has a chance to demonstrate his ability. While the other principals are competent, their work is incidental.The scenes of battle and of camp life during lulls in the campaign possess an unusual air of reality. Considering that the film was made about three years ago, there are not as many mechanical defects as might be expected.At the 86th Street CasinoTwo of the Teuton screen's most capable and charming actresses, Camilla Horn and Olga Tschechowa, are the leading figures in \\"Rote Orchideen\\" (Red Orchids), the RFD production directed by Nunzio Malasomma now at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre.This does not mean that Albrecht Schoenhals, as one of two young government draftsmen accused of having sold secret plans to a foreign agent (Herbert Huebner), is negligible. In fact, his efforts to save his comrade (Fred Doederlein) from the gallows, after he himself has managed to flee, keep the spectators on the anxious seat right up to the end. But to persons following the professional activities of Frauen Horn and Tschechowa for years, the way in which they set the calendar at naught is a joy in itself.The action, although amusingly linked with chess-playing, moves rapidly and provides lots of moderate thrills. Other players in the company are Walter Janssen, Paul Westermeier, Hans Nielson and Ursula Herking.At the Teatro LatinoThe name, \\"La India Bonita\\" (The Pretty Indian Girl), of the new romantic musical comedy at the Teatro Latino, ought to be in the plural. In addition to Anita Campillo and Maria Luisa Zea, both genuine beauties (although it is doubtful if they are 100 per cent Indian), the big cast includes lots of other pretty girls assembled for a native beauty contest in Mexico City, which furnishes the excuse for plenty of pleasant singing and dancing and many amusing complications.Emilio Tuero reveals a nice voice, as the country lad fearful of losing his sweetheart to the city slickers (one of whom is the well-known Julian Soler), while Don Catarino, the \\"Mexican Charlie Chaplin,\\" is as funny as usual in a similar rôle. As is proper, there are no villains in this AZTLA production and the grand finale sees several couples on the way to the altar. The technique is good, and the direction by Antonio Helu is smooth. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"At the Teatro Hispano At the 86th Street Casino At the Teatro Latino"},{"year":"1938","title":"Turned out in Madrid shortly before the civil war interrupted the activities of Spanish motion-picture makers, \\"La Verbena de la Paloma\\" (the name of a popular fiesta which served as the basis for a well-known comic opera by Tomas Breton and Ricardo de la Vega), now at the Teatro Iris on Washington Heights, is about the nearest thing to a film operetta seen here in a long time.Directed in his usual lively manner by Benito Perojo for the CIFESA concern, this amusing and earpleasing tale of the misadventures of an old would-be Don Juan (well played by Miguel Ligero) who takes two pretty dressmakers to the fiesta to the great indignation of a likely young printer (Roberto Rey) hardly has a dull moment. Raquel Rodrigo and Charito Leonis prove how charming Spanish girls can be, despite the handicap of the costumes and customs of the early Eighteen Nineties.It is said that the production cost 1,000,000 pesetas, a lot of money in Spain, but superficial lavishness hardly compensates for mechanical deficiences.

The present portion has to do with an honest cop who tries to redeem his no-good son from the underworld, but who finally has to commit what it is hard not too refer to as Harry Carey by personally liquidating the lad with his service revolver. The son is played by the callous Bruce Cabot—of the Cabots who speak only out of the sides of their mouths. Jacqueline Wells is his credulous-eyed fiancée, who continues to believe to the bitter end. Incidentally, there must be a good drama school in \\"Hell's Kitchen,\\" too, or where could Jacqueline have acquired that accent?At the Teatro LatinoIn \\"Los Olvidados de Dios\\" (\\"Those Forgotten by God\\"), the new Mexican picture at the Teatro Latino, the work of the principal actors, Ramon Pereda and Adriana Lamar, who is making a personal appearance on the stage of the Latino, is so good that the routine nature of the action is likely to be forgotten by the audience.Señor Pereda, who also directed and produced this offering, is entirely convincing as an honest working man who does a stretch of five years at hard labor for a murder he didn't commit, and almost is convicted for another killing of which he is innocent. Señorita Lamar makes his devoted, hardworking wife so charming that it is easy to understand the feelings of the handsome villain (Pedro Armendariz), who pursues her with his unwelcome attentions to a deservedly fatal ending.The comedy in the piece is well taken care of by Humberto Rodriguez and Isabel Branch.At the Modern PlayhouseFine views of mountains and valleys in that part of Transylvania, lost to Hungary as a result of the World War, which region has been a bone of contention between Budapest and Bucharest ever since, make \\"Uz Bence,\\" the mildly irredentist Magyar rural romance now at the Modern Playhouse in lower Yorkville, well worth seeing.Paul Javor is first-rate, as usual, in the title role of a son of nature whose rough-hewn patriotism and love win their reward in the last reel. Bella Bordy is attractive and competent as the feminine lead. Laszlo Szilassy does well as the young Hungarian editor of a clandestine paper, while Gerö Maly puts considerable humor into the character of the half-Magyar, half-Rumanian local government agent.A well-trained bear acting as the companion of Uz Bence in his mountain home plays an important part under the smooth guidance of Jenö Csepreghy, who directed the picture for the Hunnia Mester company.

Kiep, and Mayor Walker, who were introduced by Frederick Wynne-Jones, managing director for Ufa in this country, the Cosmopolitan Theatre was reopened last night as a Ufa house for the showing of foreign language pictures. The presentation for this occasion was a German dialogue film titled, \\"Der Grosse Tenor,\\" in which Emil Jannings appears as the stellar player.Dr. Kiep, who spoke first in English and then in German, welcomed the idea of having a Ufa theatre in this city and expressed his gratification at the Mayor of New York honoring the first night with his presence. Mayor Walker alluded to the cordiality and hospitality with which he was received in Berlin in 1927. He said that the only regret he had was that pictures and not pitchers were the attraction. He hoped that Ufa would send over the best productions possible, as he believed in competition, which, he averred, would make for even better understanding between the two nations.As for the picture, which followed several flashes from Ufa's fine short subjects, including the memorable \\"Killing the Killer,\\" it is one well worthy of such an event. The theme is probably none too novel, but is worked out with splendid atmospheric effects and detail, and although its idea may be as old as opera singing, it possesses an undeniable glamor. And this is aside from the fine performance of Emil Jannings, who whether he is a king, a czar, a general, a hotel porter, a bank clerk or a saloon keeper, is always able to inveigle one's attention. Here, as usual, his acting is thorough, in fact a good deal better than it has been in some of his films, for his movements are well timed and one might hazard that even in his case the fact that he has to speak his lines enriches his interpretation.But it should be asid that it is quite apparent that he does not do the singing for this tenor, Albert Winkelmann, the principal character in this production. Notwithstanding, this, in most of the scenes his supposed ability as a singer is encompassed so shrewdly that it does not detract from the story.Winkelmann is a pampered tenor whose weaknesses, in spite of having an attractive wife, are other fair creatures and wine.Agathe, his wife, is constantly made aware of girls concealed in rooms adjoining her husband's dressing apartment, but she, like most of Winklemann's admirers, humors him. He has reached that peak of success where he has become annoyingly temperamental to his managers, for it is with difficulty that they can persuade him to appear on the stage on time. He makes up as the dusky Othello and roars at his valet to give him his headgear and his cloak. One hears him trying his voice with \\"mi-mi-mi-mi\\" and subsequently he deigns to appear before the worshipful audience.Then follows the sequence where Winklemann leaves for Buenos Aires. His wife is bidding him auf wiedersehn, but the second she turns her back and before she has left the station platform another woman appears. Frau Winklemann well realizes her husband's faithlessness as the train moves slowly on its way. This tenor's début in the South American city is left to the imagination, as it should be. The producers then take up Winklemann in later stages of his singing career in Buenos Aires, when his temperamental outbursts, coupled with his debauchery and drinking, cause them to engage a younger tenor as a substitute when the time comes. The presence of this young man, named Cardagno, is unbearable to Winklemann. He frets when he hears Cardagno singing in the next dressing room, and it irks the great tenor to observe his possible substitute in the same regalia as himself. The heat of the country gets on his nerves. He bribes a man to buy him wine and bring it to his dressing room, and finally comes the climactic moment when he appears on the stage and cannot sing a note.In one of the scenes preceding Winklemann's breakdown the opera manager is perceived outside the tenor's dressing room. This manager has been urging the tenor to hurry. The manager listens to the singer warbling, and his expression changes from anxiety to gladness. The tenor is going to be able to get through with the performance!But that is not to be, for it is soon afterward that Winklemann appears on the stage and discovers that, like a man in a nightmare, he cannot make a sound.Here tragedy, which has stalked forth in most of Mr. Jannings's pictures, is avoided. He does not become a slovenly, pathetic creature, although Winklemann is heart-broken at having lost his fine singing voice. He consults a physician, who has no hope for his voice. Thereupon he returns to his charming home on the Rhine. When the steamer reaches the place where he must disembark, he is a gloomy, dejected figure, unable to muster up courage to face his wife.The authors of this tale have, however, discovered that sunshine and exercise in the open work marvels on the singer, and one day he finds that his singing voice has returned. Agathe is filled with joy, and in course of time Winklemann goes back to the opera in Vienna and sings for the five hundred and first time the leading male rôle of \\"Lohengrin.\\"Mr. Jannings, who as Winklemann frequently quotes the words of a song, \\"I am so happy, I am so gay,\\" exhibits his talent for screen acting throughout his portrayal. His work is so splendid that while a knowledge of German helps one to appreciate the picture more, one can still enjoy virtually all that is happening in \\"Der Grosse Tenor\\" without understanding the Teutonic tongue. Renate Mueller is capital as Agathe. Olga Tschechowa is good as one of the flirtatious women. Hans Moser gives a worthy account of himself as Winklemann's valet. In fact all the players serve the picture with unusual ability.

Relegated in the past to the museum's branch galleries, now defunct, the students' exhibitions this year fill the second floor of the Whitney itself. Even in this high-profile venue, though, the atmosphere of the seminar room hangs heavy in the air. Both shows give evidence of an instinct for provocation, but their reliance on off-the-rack academic theory and an all-purpose, in-your-face 90's pique keeps their impact low.   This is especially true of \\"Abject Art,\\" a potential wild card of a show, which strikes some sparks but never manages either to define or to transcend its fashionably melodramatic title. \\"Abject art\\" is a term suggested by the theoretician Julia Kristeva to designate art based on the image of the human body, but specifically the body fragmented and decayed or represented by one of its socially less presentable functions (scatological images, for example, abound in the show). In depicting what most people would rather not see, the theory goes, art breaks through societal taboos, especially those surrounding sexuality.

Gone are Mr. Guitry and his nine bachelors, and instead in stroll \\"The Pasha's Wives,\\" perfumed, whispering and not a little shocked by the monogamous notions of a lady from Paris. Thus, the issue is apparent. Shall the old make way for the new? Shall the corrupt and backward reign of the old Turkish sultan survive or shall a new era come to the shores of the Bosporus—and in its wake, bathtubs, electric lights and romantic love? But perhaps this is too much for \\"The Pasha's Wives\\" to answer. Like its imprisoned ladies, the film is torpid as if it also had been too long in the close air of the harem.It is not to place a mild face upon the facts, one of the shining examples of French film art. It is much too prolonged for its slight story, much too indefinite as to its direction, to rate as more than a curious fable set against an exotic background. Briefly, it tells of a young Pasha returning to Constantinople in 1910 with his Parisian bride and some progressive ideas for social reform. The corrupt retinue of the sultan intrigue against him and induce the sultan to confer upon the ardent young monogamist a second wife, thereby compromising him and creating a considerable tension in his private seraglio. But love finds a way, and after a hectic pursuit the young Pasha and his bride escape to Europe, where a man may have but one wife—at a time.This, for what it is worth in this restless world of 1942, is the story. It is told in an unaccented and monotonous style, too sluggish even to come to a climax. But it is endowed with several capable performances. Viviane Romance, as the bride from Paris, is neither monotonous nor unaccented, but more seductive in her charm than a whole sultan's harem. Dalio, as the sultan, gives a capital portrait of a shrewd old monarch frightened out of his wits by the new electric lights. Saturnin Fabre and Lupovici are excellent in subordinate roles. John Lodge as the young husband is about as flexible and expressive as a stick. Though it absorbs some of the drugging atmosphere of its colorful environment and is brightened here and there by the amorous gossip of the harem, \\"The Pasha's Wives\\" progressively succumbs to its own languor.

Enlightenment is iffy business, at least it was until raves brought young scene makers into a brand-new age.   Tipping its stocking cap to psychedelia, the English-borne dance movement known as rave encourages a belief in the possibilities of mind expansion through electronic beats and synthesized hallucinogens. On the dance floor, the quest resembles the dervish's twirl into frenzy. But even the most energetic ravers sometimes need a break and seek a space where their mental journeys can follow a less physically demanding path.

Instead of the audience's being required to respect the performers, the performers must respect the sanctity of the audience's evening. A concert must be interwoven inextricably into a party, beginning and ending without rupturing mood or continuity.         This was the case on Friday night when Straylight performed at Soundlab in Chinatown, a weekly club night with a focus on experimental dance music, and when Air Liquide performed at Home, a weekly rave at Vinyl in TriBeCa. All the rules of concert decorum were broken at these parties, with audience members continuing their conversations, peering over the musicians' shoulders and dozing off either on hammocks and beanbags at Soundlab or on the stage itself at Vinyl. These were signs of good performances: if the music was bad, people would have just retrieved their coats and left, especially since Straylight's show didn't start until midnight and Air Liquide's until 4 A.M.

Mr. Harper, a tenor saxophonist who has been sadly overlooked for the last decade, writes complicated tunes that usually build on some sort of musical motif. Most of them have rhythmic patterns, or a series of musical ideas that are kept constant through the piece. When improvisers get going, and the band is itching to follow them, the pressure to break down the walls of a composition creates real drama.   Mr. Harper's ideas are audience friendly","excerpt":"at times he and the trumpeter Eddie Allen engaged in curt polyphony, where Mr. Allen, the wittier of the two, would throw out funny ideas that Mr. Harper might or might not take up. His pieces shift emotions quickly; from section to section, improvisers were forced not only to change musical direction, but emotional direction as well. On the last tune of the set, Mr. Harper and Mr. Allen performed a repeating melody that dropped notes on cue until it nearly vanished.

The catch is that Mr. Pelt, above, professes no interest in emulating Mr. Hubbard, or Miles Davis, to whom he is also reflexively (and less credibly) compared. He called his last album ''Identity,'' and its release on the MaxJazz label last year came as a rebuke to anyone who assumed he was still searching for one. Some of the best moments on the album conjured the exploratory mode of late-60's postbop with a gimlet-eyed practicality that left little room for nostalgia. Mr. Pelt takes a similar approach with Creation, an ensemble he formed nearly four years ago that has yet to issue a studio album. (Some tracks recorded a few years ago can be found in Mr. Pelt's ''MP3 Live Series,'' a laudably extensive audio archive maintained at www.peltjazz.com.) Creation consists of Mr. Pelt on trumpet, Myron Walden on alto saxophone and bass clarinet, Mike Moreno on guitar, Warren Wolf on vibraphone, Derek Nievergelt on bass and Tommy Crane on drums. It's Mr. Pelt's only band without a pianist, a distinction that tilts his improvisation toward the open-ended and celestial, appropriate qualities for the Rose Center for Earth and Space, which plays host to the band this evening.

Though indeed a biography of the late John Lennon, it is less an exploitative exercise in sensationalism than a sincere attempt to uncover the main man behind the Beatles's legend. Perhaps, in retrospect, a little more sensationalism would have helped. If ''Lennon'' is rarely tasteless, it is always flavorless - or, to put a finer point on it, dull.   The show was ''conceived'' and directed by Bob Eaton, who originated it at Liverpool's Everyman Theater, where he is artistic director.

An early pop eclecticist, Mr. Palmer has spent his career experimenting with reggae, hard rock, African pop and New Orleans music: he comes off as a less literary version of Paul Simon. And because he adds the look of an Italian suit to his image, he's brought a Julio Iglesias-like sexuality to his eclecticism","excerpt":"at times Mr. Palmer looked like an out-of-town businessman whose real attentions were always focused on seduction.

On the one hand, it is asserted that Alexander Moissi, the well-known German actor who plays the part of Edmund Kean, the British actor-hero of the piece, is far below par in the dialogue picture, and that the reproduction is poor, while, on the other, it is averred that Moissi is fine and the machine all right. On the negative side a writer in the Frankfurter Zeitung said:\\"The technical reproduction is bad","excerpt":"at times nothing can be understood, which is especially distressing because they are talking on the screen all the time. It may be that this defect is partly due to the apparatus, but the two leading players certainly are responsible for some of it. Moissi plays very old-fashioned theatre right along and tries to surprise the spectators, as if he wanted to make a hit at a lecture. Nobody knew that Camilla Horn could talk, and she doesn't prove that she can in this film either. * * * Even the Steglitz public burst into loud laughter several times when Moissi, on the canvas, talked pathetic stuff in a pathetic way. The high 'C' of the older dramatists, especially the simple cry 'Beloved!' simply is not caught by the technical apparatus of the sound films. When in one scene, however, Moissi began to play Hamlet and to repeat the monologue 'To be or not to be,' silence fell upon the audience. With a few words Shakespeare bridged the centuries and imposed quiet. We could have listened to him for hours.\\"Among the approving critics is the writer in the Berlin Vorwärts, who remarked:\\"Alexander Moissi as Kean dominates the situation. The other players act mechanically in comparison. Moissi, who was a failure in the silent films, because in his case mimicry and gestures only win life and expression through the spoken word, plays here 100 per cent dramatically and develops a wonderful theatrical grace. His intense voice loses hardly any of its charm.

Mr. Tronzo's band played a handful of pieces that instead relied on loose improvisations that had their roots in live performance.

The piece was built around exchanges, and Mr. McLaughlin, who had toned down the electronic effects he used for most of the set, and Mr. Gurtu carried on a long conversation, full of puns and asides and digressions.

They also tasted continuously, but always had a pot of boiling water nearby on the stove so that they could periodically roll the mixture into a little ball and boil it for a few minutes before tasting.     This was the detail the mother of the subject failed to pass on to the next generation. One does not eat freshwater sushi.    Robert Rosenberg, O.D.  Great Neck, N.Y.    To the Editor:     Re Tale of the Tapeworm: Some years ago, working as a radiographic technician, I saw a priest who had recently returned to New York from China, where he had served as a missionary. He complained of pain in the elbow. My X-ray showed the shadow of a worm curled up in the joint area. Yes, he had regularly eaten raw fish in China.     June A. Gelb  Boca Raton, Fla.    To the Editor:     Re Tales of the Tapeworm: After a particularly disappointing experience, I was searching for a reason to stay in public health when I picked up a book by Robert Desowitz, New Guinea Tapeworms and Jewish Grandmothers. The columnist, Dr. Larry Zaroff, is not the first to observe the perils of gefilte fish.    Naomi Wolinsky  Elberon, N.J.    To the Editor:     Thank you, Dr. Larry Zaroff, for your column Tales of the Tapeworm about the Jewish housewives disease, B12 deficiency anemia secondary to infestation with the fish tapeworm, stemming from making gefilte fish.     This was mentioned at least twice, as I recall, in my osteopathic medical school in the 70s in Kirksville, Mo. not exactly a hotbed of traditional Jewish cooking during infectious disease and hematology courses.     Now when I mention it to my patients or residents, I wont be met with so many incredulous looks.    Michael G. Dempsey, D.O.  Manhattan    Coping With Pain    To the Editor:     Re Scientists Cast Misery of Migraine in a New Light (Personal Health, Aug 8): Like Jane E. Brody, I grew up in a migraine family. I started nursing my mother through chronic migraines when I was 5.     When migraines hit my brothers, cousins and me, we all discovered different triggering factors (mold, disco lights, MSG, sensory overload, stress, too much driving, neglecting meals and weather changes), and we all have different remedies (I drink fresh orange juice and strong tea, and take a blistering hot shower).      Others find relief by pressing a bag of ice cubes around their necks and heads or by downing vitamin B. Weve also found preventive help through acupuncture, shiatsu, regular exercise, and heeding warning signs and triggering factors. Far better than reliance on prescription meds.    Pamela Ellen Ferguson  Austin, Tex.    To the Editor:     Misery of Migraine mentions that of the supplements, butterbur and riboflavin were shown to be effective in several good studies. In fact, both were subjected only to a single good study (we participated in the one on butterbur).      However, several good studies do exist to support the efficacy of feverfew and magnesium (we conducted one of them), which were not mentioned.    Alexander Mauskop, M.D.  Manhattan    The writer is the director of the New York Headache Center.    To the Editor:     Re Misery of Migraine: I am typing this letter in the midst of a migraine attack. What allows me to be functional is the miracle of triptans, which, after a lifetime of suffering (I am 47), I was prescribed about four years ago, shortly after my mother died.      Triptans control or kill outright about 80 percent of my migraines. I only wish that my mother had lived long enough to know there is life beyond migraine. How she, and we, suffered needlessly!    Donna J. Anton  Hayle, England    To the Editor:     Some 50 years ago, our family doctor (the $5 home-visit species) prescribed Cafegot to be taken at the onset of my headache. It was a lifesaver until several years after menopause, when the headaches lessened in intensity.    Helen Supnick  Brooklyn    To the Editor:     Re Misery of Migraine: I suffered migraines from childhood, often misdiagnosed and misunderstood. (One doctor even suggested viral meningitis.) Prescriptions I received in adulthood added nausea to the pain but little else. Finally, frustrated with treating symptoms, I tried prevention. I started by looking at when I came down with them.     Weather changes, as the column notes, were the key. Fronts coming in from the west bring pollens and mold spores with them. My seasonal migraines began to make sense. So I asked my doctor for an allergy prescription.     Almost immediately, my migraines were reduced from perhaps a couple of dozen a year to almost none. That was 10 years ago.    Daniel Ward  New York    To the Editor     Re Misery of Migraine: I strongly second Jane E. Brodys call to consult a doctor who deals with and treats migraines regularly. I suffered for many years with various diagnoses like its a virus or its vestibular dysfunction because I would become nauseated, have a stuffed nose and suffer from dizziness.      After visiting a rehabilitation center and being told that what I really have is migraines, I was directed to the Headache Institute at St. Lukes-Roosevelt.     There, my life was changed by getting a daily dosage of Nortriptyline. I still occasionally have headaches, which I treat with migraine medicine, but no longer do I have to take to my bed every three weeks or so. I hope others will take the advice of Ms. Brody and see a neurologist.    Marilyn Katz  Mamaroneck, N.Y.    Shortchanging Prevention    To the Editor:     Re Talking About AIDS, With All the World Watching (The Doctors World, Aug. 8): AIDS is something that can be prevented by behavior change, and it is sad to read that the emphasis of the AIDS conference will be almost entirely on cures. Yes, curing AIDS is important, but a comparable amount of money and brain power should be spent on prevention.    Robert W. Leach  Swarthmore, Pa.    To the Editor:     Re Talking About AIDS: Dr. Lawrence K. Altmans overview of 15 international AIDS conferences is replete with noteworthy breakthroughs. Having attended each enclave until Durban and Bangkok, I welcome Dr. Altmans acumen and his ability to set the stage for the Toronto conference.      Although experts often find the conferences less than hospitable for meaningful professional dialogue, theyve learned to explain and defend their findings to the core audience: people infected with H.I.V.     These conferences resemble family reunions, and as such have enabled the global H.I.V. family to understand and celebrate the breakthroughs, honor the departed and recommit to the hard work at home.    B.J. Stiles  San Francisco    The writer is the former president and chief executive of the National AIDS Fund.    Meteors and the Moon    To the Editor:      Re Scientists Chip Away at Mysteries of the Moon (Aug. 8): Could the disparities in the sides of the Moon be caused by the far side having millennia of disproportionate meteor hits? Since it faces away from Earth, it would get hit by many more drawn in by Earths gravity. The dust would be compacted by gravity. New meteors would repeatedly hit on top causing an entirely different dynamic for that hemisphere: a snow cone shape with the cone toward Earth.    Sheldon Zablow, M.D.  San Diego    Getting an Early Diagnosis    To the Editor:     Motion Detectors Double as Alzheimers Monitors (Vital Signs, Aug. 8) was quite interesting, and the idea of such a technique is very innovative.      I do take issue, however, with the comment questioning the practicality of other ways to obtain an early diagnosis of so-called mild cognitive impairment.     These kinds of diagnoses are currently made on a regular basis by psychologists trained in clinical neuropsychology. As a clinical neuropsychologist specializing in geriatrics, I am regularly called upon to determine whether a patient is suffering from mild cognitive impairment.      The diagnosis is made on the basis of a battery of tests of attention, concentration, memory, and verbal and executive functioning. The evaluation is usually conducted in two sessions of about two hours each.      Based on the pattern of results, an early and reliable determination may be made of an incipient memory disorder.    Stanford M. Singer  New York    Drugs and Suicide    To the Editor:     Re New Depression Findings Could Alter Treatments (Aug. 8): I applaud your reporting that depressed children on antidepressants are at significantly greater risk for attempting suicide than depressed children who dont take these drugs. It is a confirmation of findings of great import.     But in the same article (and only obliquely referenced) is a similarly important fact: antidepressants do not reduce suicidality among adults. For decades, depressed people have been encouraged to take antidepressants, often in emergency settings and sometimes under duress, by doctors operating under the grave misconception that these drugs can prevent suicide.      Some may argue that antidepressants can reduce suffering (notoriously difficult to measure) among the depressed, and this may well be true. But health professionals should stop recommending antidepressant medications thinking that they are saving their patients lives. At best, antidepressants are ineffective for this purpose","excerpt":"at worst, they can cause definitive harm.    Seana O'Callaghan  Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.    Safes and Gun Safety    To the Editor:     Re Guns and Children (Letter, Aug. 8) and Is Your Child a Split Second From Disaster? (Personal Health, Aug. 1):      Jane E. Brody, in her column, suggests locking up ammunition and unloaded guns separately for safety, but a reader argues that this thwarts the need for quick access to confront a robber who breaks in.

Ely has its origin in a journal kept by the artist's grandfather during a 16-week journey to Egypt in the 1920's, but any resemblance to a conventional travelogue ends there. Pyramids, circles, serpentine lines -- even depictions of the journal itself -- are embedded in colored maps and landscapes, with an occasional snapshot thrown in the mix. Indecipherable hieroglyphical writing appears alongside English words and baffling phrases (\\"concertina guard + coptic w/ beads\\"), bookbinding instructions, cartographic markings and snatches of the journal. None of this makes any sense, but that may be beside the point, since Mr. Ely seems to be more interested in providing a mandala than a Rosetta stone. \\"What I'm trying to do is assemble symbols in such a way that a shift occurs in  the viewer . . . a heightened awareness, like getting a whiff of a strange smell and suddenly getting just a little bit of clarity,\\" he says in a not entirely helpful interview at the end of THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT: Binding the Book (Chronicle, $25). Speaking of whiffs of strange smells, Terence McKenna, a noted advocate of hallucinogenic drugs, suggests in an entertaining foreword stuffed with New Age blarney that the best way to approach this material is from a skewed angle, perhaps (surprise) through mind-altering substances. There is undeniable craftsmanship in \\"The Flight Into Egypt,\\" which employs a relentlessly geometric -- if impenetrable -- logic and has an obsessive quality  in its detail.

(Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $12.) With a pervasive wariness and modesty, the novelist recalls the long, often stormy, friendship she and her husband, the Flaubert scholar Francis Steegmuller, struck up with Graham Greene, who is portrayed as a proud but prickly soul who ruthlessly disagreed with anyone who agreed with him. ''Hazzard tells of a relationship that was a treasure hunt among nettles,'' Richard Eder wrote in the Book Review last year. Her ''feeling for the landscape is incantatory.''    SOME THINGS THAT STAY, by Sarah Willis. (Berkley, $13.) This first novel's feisty narrator is an artist's 15-year-old daughter who is intent on testing life's possibilities (including her ability to fly) as she comes of age in a small town in upstate New York in 1954. She is ''an engaging character not because she gains insight but because she's so responsive to the world,'' Joanna Scott wrote here in 2000.    LIVING TO TELL, by Antonya Nelson. (Scribner, $13.) An entire family -- the Mabies of Wichita, Kan. -- is the protagonist of this wry, obsessively observed novel, which begins with the return of a son from a prison sentence for killing his grandmother while driving drunk. ''The story's hard-won, moderately happy ending is a satisfying benediction'' upon an ensemble cast ''about which the reader has truly come to care,'' Emily Barton said here last year.    EXPERIENCE: A Memoir, by Martin Amis. (Vintage International, $14.) The novelist crams a lot into his account of growing up in the shadow of his father, Kingsley Amis, including his youthful wanderings, his midlife crisis, his withering assessments of fellow writers and even his elaborate dental work. '' 'Experience' is a portmanteau of personal history, ancestor worship and promiscuous opinionizing, and a pi&#241","excerpt":"ata of literary gossip,'' John Leonard wrote in these pages last year.    THE END OF THE PEACE PROCESS: Oslo and After, by Edward W. Said. (Vintage, $14.) In a series of angry essays that find fault with all involved in the Middle East power struggle, the author, a professor at Columbia University and an eloquent advocate of the Palestinian cause, views the 1993 Oslo accord as an unpalatably one-sided expression of Zionism. ''You don't have to agree with Said to admire him,'' Ethan Bronner said here last year. His voice is ''deep, rich and courageous in what is often a scripted and dishonest international dispute.'' Yoram Hazony, the author of The Jewish State: The Struggle for Israel's Soul (Basic Books, $18), maintains that some leading intellectuals have been undermining the Jewish purpose and nature of Israel and calls for a new vision that will revitalize the nation's mission. Last year in these pages, Walter Reich said that even if ''Hazony's argument is at times overheated,'' his book ''contains much that is valuable and illuminating.'' Between Memory and Desire: The Middle East in a Troubled Age, by R. Stephen Humpreys (University of California, $17.95), explores the many stubborn issues facing a region whose most serious challenges, he says, lie less in economics than in perceptions, habits and attitudes. In 1999 our reviewer, Max Rodenbeck, called this an ''objective yet sympathetic, scholarly yet accessible'' work.    THE SLEEP-OVER ARTIST, by Thomas Beller. (Norton, $13.) Less a novel than a set of interwoven stories, this collection follows the evolution of its hapless Holden Caulfieldesque hero from the age of 6, when he's tossing water on people from the windows of high-rises, into his mid-20's, when he's fumbling toward maturity and becoming entangled in romantic relationships. ''Beller is particularly skilled'' at capturing ''the myriad stages of fear, discovery and elation that mark one's first sexual experiences,'' Katherine Dieckmann wrote here last year.    WHEN MOUNTAINS WALKED, by Kate Wheeler. (Mariner/ Houghton Mifflin, $13.) This first novel unfolds along parallel tracks as it tells of an idealistic young woman struggling to bring health and prosperity to a remote Peruvian valley, and of the woman's grandmother, who traveled to the region many years earlier -- with tragic results. ''It's the kind of novel you gulp down, curious to find out what happens next,'' Susan Bolotin said here in 2000.    LEGACY OF THE DEAD, by Charles Todd. (Bantam, $5.99.) A guilt-ridden detective sent to Scotland to identify the remains of an English aristocrat finds that the person accused of murdering the noblewoman was the fianc&#233;e of a soldier he executed during World War I. The result is a ''study of postwar Scotland as a land rich in beauty but barren of new life,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote here last year.

So it easy to understand an unusual maneuver last week by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is in need of good news as he struggles to close a multibillion-dollar budget gap caused by the national recession and the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center.    For years the city's huge budget has been put together in what the key players call a dance: the mayor threatens cuts, the City Council fights them, and the mayor gives in on some. But this year, Mr. Bloomberg proposed a string of unpopular service cuts. Then, after his approval ratings slid, he announced on his own last week that he would back down on some of them. He said he would find another $90 million in the city's $44.5 billion budget to keep picking up the trash more than once a week, to preserve library hours and to maintain rush hour service on the Staten Island Ferry.

The room had once been a servant's during the days when the building was a residential hotel, and it had not been renovated for 40 years. It was partitioned into a bedroom and a bathroom; the building's rusty steam pipe ran through a space over the door; and there was so little daylight that lights were needed at high noon. &#8220;The only reusable surface was the floor,&#8221; says Woodson Rainey. The need to build a kitchen and a new bathroom and to hide the plumbing lines led to the room's most dramatic architectural feature. The Raineys built a platform, two steps up from the living area, to create a space for the kitchen and the bathroom. This platform crosses the room on the diagonal and extends as a ledge beneath the windows. A long step, which can serve as a table or as a place to sit, juts out into the room. over the platform, at a 45&#8208;degree angle. Part of the ceiling was lowered to cover the steam pipe. There are only two pieces of conventional furniture, an Italian sleep sofa and an antique Windsor chair. The walls are all white, except for the front door, which is bright yellow.
