It is both intimate and airy, done in white with green flower-sprigged provincial print chair covers, ceiling fans, ship's lanterns and one wall completely mirrored to provide a greater illusion of space.

Republic's \\"The Eternal Sea,\\" recounting the naval career of Rear Admiral John M. Hoskins, is not a distinguished entry by any means. But as an unpretentiously engrossing tribute to a man's unpretentious realism and courage, it could hardly be more appealing. It was unveiled yesterday on the screens of Loew's neighborhood showcases.Nicely acted throughout by a shipshape little cast featuring Sterling Hayden in the title role, Alexis Smith and Dean Jagger, the action, neither sentimental nor spectacular, has been charted with thoughtful bluntness in Allen Rivkin's adaptation of a William Wister Haines story. The incidents are consistently credible and heartwarming, even with a nagging musical score and one of those heavenly choirs. This is due in large measure to John H. Auer's deceptively simple direction. Finally, some of the best and most unobtrusive photography of aircraft carrier scenes ever made neutralizes about half the picture in semi-documentary style.But it is the deliberate lack of style at all, the direct artlessness, that strikes home. The story simply tells how its hero, as a captain, doggedly and unselfishly mastered a situation that would have shelved most men, the loss of a leg in Philippine combat. Scorning official retirement, he fights for even greater responsibilities, and finally as a rear admiral in Korea personally activates his dream of carrier-based jets.Mr. Hayden may have activated more intricate histrionic tasks—take \\"The Asphalt Jungle\\"—but he has never been more likable. Miss Smith, as his faithful spouse, does nicely on the sidelines. Mr. Jagger, as Vice Admiral Thomas L. Semple, his lifelong friend, is excellent, and Ben Cooper, Virginia Grey, Hayden Rorke and Douglas Kennedy fall right in step with the rest. This is supposed to be a true story. Republic, at any rate, has itself a true little picture.
