It is a splendid piece of work, the modern touches serving as oil for any creaking joints the old play might have had. The producers deserve great praise for having filmed this farce without the inclusion of a single coarse note.Mr. Thomas's footlights version was first played in the West End of London in October, 1892, and a year later it was making New Yorkers roar with merriment at the old Standard Theatre. It is certainly a vehicle which has stood the test of time, as it is noteworthy that the film rights cost £20,000, which is a remarkable sum to be paid for any farce, especially one written so long ago.Sydney Chaplin figures in the title rôle made famous in London by William Penley and in this country by Etienne Girardot. Mr. Chaplin, who is a brother of the illustrious Charles, has already won his spurs as a screen comedian in several productions, but be excels anything that he has done by his portrayal of Charley's \\"Aunt.\\" Occasionally one might imagine that he is a little boisterous, but it should be remembered that he is, after all, supposed to be a college wag taking full advantage of the impersonation forced upon him by his two college chums, who must have a chaperon at luncheon for their sweethearts, the true aunt having disappointed them.The fun starts when Mr. Chaplin appears as the aunt, his trousers concealed by a voluminous black silk skirt, trimmed with cream lace, a wig of several curls and a Victorian lace gap. It is exceedingly comic when the occasionally gay old lady delights in kissing \\"her\\" friends' sweethearts, but the frolic comes when the \\"Aunt,\\" known as the fabulously wealthy widow of a Brazilian, is pursued by two elderly admirers, Sir Francis Chesney (Phillips Smaller) and Mr. Spettigue (James E. Page). Sir Francis is ??? rsistent for a while, but he eventually surrenders in favor of Spettigue, who employs vegetables and flowers in the terms of endearment ??? pours into the \\"Aunt's\\" ears.Again and again the \\"Aunt\\" informs the young people and the two respectable white-haired flirts that she hails from Brazil \\"where the nuts come from.\\" Asked whether she has any children, she at first replies in the negative and later says: \\"Oh, just a few, nothing to speak of.\\"Even a cynical stoic would have to give way when the \\"Aunt\\" feels the need of stimulating drink. First \\"she\\" pours out the whisky, but the elderly Spettigue appears suddenly and fancies the whisky is for him. \\"She\\" makes a second attempt and Sir Francis takes the glass from \\"her.\\" The third attempt is also a disappointment, as although the \\"Aunt\\" has concealed the glass in the pocket of her skirts, the boisterous display of affection on the part of Spettigue causes it to spill, and the consequent actions of the \\"Aunt\\" made the Colony echo with loud peals of laughter.Mr. Thomas certainly made this farce a finished piece of work when he introduced the real aunt. Donna Lucia d'Alvardorez (Eulalie Jensen), who talks to the \\"funny old lady,\\" informing \\"her\\" that she knew her husband intimately. Soon after this, when one might imagine the fun would simmer down, the mirth gains new impetus by the \\"Aunt\\" losing her skirts. With a screen at one time and a convenient portière at another, the humor is continued, the \\"Aunt\\" occasionally showing \\"herself\\" alone and to \\"her\\" college chums in the ridiculous make-up of half Victorian lady and half college undergraduate.Mr. Chaplin is brilliantly supported by other members of the cast, especially by Mr. Page, who played the rôle of Spettigue for many years on the stage, and also by Mr. Smalley.Scott Sidney, the director, and F. McGrew Willis are to be congratulated on their respective work in this production. There are periods when one chuckles, and then the action is so ably timed that it causes one to explode with hilarious laughter. Mr. Sidney appears to have omitted just one trifling detail, and that is the welcoming of the real aunt by the nephew and his friend. Possibly this may be excused on the ground that both these young gentlemen were stunned by the boisterous antics of the impersonator.This film will make the whole country roar with laughter and renew the fame of the old farce.

But with the specter of a strike still looming for next week, the railroads continued to try to reach agreements that would allow them to keep the commuter railways operating even if a strike occured.   B1    Prison Inmates Using the Law  Law-enforcement officials say prison inmates are using the state's Freedom of Information law to obtain sensitive material. In one such case, Maria Molina was shocked to discover that a man she dated more than a decade ago, and who was later convicted of killing a friend, had used the law to obtain her address from the New York City Board of Elections. She said she had been told that the killer blamed her for his descent into addiction and crime.   B1    Jogger Raped Near Cloisters  A 45-year-old woman jogging in the woods behind the Cloisters, the replica of a medieval monastery tucked inside Fort Tryon Park in upper Manhattan, was raped shortly before dawn, the police said. The police said they had no suspects.   B3    A Modern Mayflower Compact  Some 377 years and 14 or more generations after Priscilla Mullens rejected the marriage proposal of Miles Standish, who arrived on the Mayflower, descendants of the two finally got it together: Caroline Hannaford Pillsbury, a Standish descendant, and Andrew Oliver 2d, who traces his lineage to Priscilla and John Alden, were married on Saturday at the Episcopal Church of the Ascension and St. Agnes in Washington.   A1    Bond Drive for Schools  A diverse coalition of educators, union organizers and business leaders is kicking off a vigorous campaign to persuade voters, particularly New York City Democrats, to approve a proposed $2.4 billion bond act on Nov. 4 to repair the state's crumbling schools.   B6    BUSINESS DAY   D1-16    AT&T Courts Hughes Chief  AT&T is expected to name C. Michael Armstrong, the head of Hughes Electronics, as its chairman and chief executive. AT&T, the nation's largest telecommunications company, has been looking for a new head since July, when John R. Walter, who had been brought in as designated successor to AT&T's long-time chairman, Robert E. Allen, resigned after barely nine months.   A1    Stocks Slip in Japan  Stocks were trading lower in Tokyo this morning. At midday, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 24.47 points, or 14-hundredths of one percent, at 17,453.95. On Friday, the Nikkei fell 229.07 points, or 1.29 percent.

So far, in fact, that it has become nearly impossible to look back. The selling point for Mr. Simon's monthlong engagement at the Paramount, modestly titled \\"The Concert Event of a Lifetime\\" and charging up to $100 a ticket, is the latest reunion of Simon and Garfunkel, performing their 1960's hits. But on Friday night, the Simon and Garfunkel songs were the only ones that begged for the perceptual haze of nostalgia.   Luckily, they were only part of a three-hour show that confirmed Mr. Simon's inspiration and ingenuity. Mr. Garfunkel turned out to be just one of a large supporting cast of Mr. Simon's collaborators and fellow singers, including Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the Mighty Clouds of Joy, Phoebe Snow and a remarkable band of American, African and Brazilian musicians.

Wagner's ''Die Feen,'' which will be performed in a concert version by the New York City Opera Feb. 24, takes the latter route, and this performance will represent somewhat of a coup for the company. The work was finished in 1834, but this is believed to be its American premiere.   If Wagner fans in America have never heard ''Die Feen'' in live performance, neither did Wagner. He tried strenuously to have it produced during his early Leipzig years, but the first staging did not take place until 1888 in Munich five years after his death. It is a tale of fairies and the fantastic and follows E.T.A. Hoffmann's philosophy of wedding make-believe worlds to those of real life.  Drawn from a fairytale by Gozzi called ''La Donna Serpente,'' the plot centers on the troubled love affair between Ada, a fairy, and Arindal, an earthly prince.

On Pentecost Island in the New Hebrides it shows you that strange, barbaric rite of men leaping from a high tower made of bamboo, with vine-ropes tied to their legs to save them, at the last split-second, from crashing into the ground. And in New Zealand it takes you by airplane to the great ski slopes in the glistening \\"southern Alps\\" before showing you landscapes and cities reminiscent of the distant British Isles.Most appealing of all the \\"adventures\\" it offers, however, is one that shows how children in the \\"out back\\" country of Australia go to school. This is done by having all the youngsters over an area of hundreds of square miles hooked in from their homes to their teacher by two-way radio. Occasionally the regular three panels of the Cinerama screen are used separately and simultaneously to show the hook-up among the teacher, the communications center and a lad on a sheep \\"station\\" (ranch). And very touching and exciting it is, too.These are only a few of the episodes, sights and experiences that are tumbled forth in this picture, which Carl Dudley has produced with the help of a crew of directors, here-and-there actors and camera men. Others—many others—are included in the abundance of a colorful travel film.It is notable that Mr. Dudley has miraculously failed to include any single episode in the gaudy tradition of that first Cinerama roller-coaster ride. However, he has slipped into his picture such naturally graphic and exciting things as that surfboard ride in Hawaii, some airplane zooming in the New Zealand alps and a thrilling trip in a lifeboat through the surf on an Australian beach.It is notable, too, that he has managed to make frequent and effective use of dissolves and also gets his triple-lens cameras up close to his subjects in many scenes. Integrating a few little stories of people picked up along the way—a pretty girl going out to Hawaii to sightsee and catch herself a beau; a French painter heading for Tahiti to follow in the steps of Paul Gauguin; the skipper of a South Seas trading schooner; a G. I. veteran returning to New Zealand and a couple more—he has personalized individuals more dramatically than this had been done in previous Cinerama offerings. It is a propitious advance.Orson Welles usually acts as narrator, but the voices of the people picked up along the way are also used to offer comments. The device makes for nice variety. Alex North's musical score is vivid and the color composition and photography are fine.\\"Cinerama — South Seas Adventure\\" is an idyl, but it is plenty and pleasantly busy all the time.

Arthur Murphy (1906-1991) was one of them.

Murphy was born in Ohio. After what he referred to as a \\"one-room, backwoods schoolhouse\\" education, he taught himself illustration and cartooning through correspondence courses, then moved to Manhattan in 1928 to study at the Art Students League.

Many were volunteering to fight for Iraq, the report said, and blood banks were full of people giving blood for Iraqi soldiers. One woman complained that the Western press had characterized all Arabs as terrorists -- a characterization that was not true, she said, but could become true if it persisted.   That Arabs would side with their Muslim brothers against what is essentially a Western force is not surprising. What is surprising is that President Bush has done so little to demonstrate good will toward the people of the Middle East. Americans do not harbor hatred for all Arabs, but if that message is not given, and given often, it is easy to see how the Arab people could begin to believe that we do. When all they see on television are reports of American aircraft using weapons of frightening sophistication to destroy Iraqi facilities, it would be easy to believe that we may next turn those weapons their way.   Why has President Bush broadcast no message of good will to all Arab people? And why has he not urged the leaders of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria to send similar messages exhorting Arabs to support the true victims, the citizens of Kuwait? The White House should initiate a campaign to assure the Arab people that our fight is only with Saddam Hussein and not with them. And the President should emphasize that Arab interests, as well as those of the rest of the world, depend upon stopping Saddam Hussein.   Will this do any good? Who can say? But it certainly can do no harm, and it costs nothing. Besides, it is the truth -- and the Arab people deserve to hear it.

The new device works by measuring minute changes in the electricity generated by the muscles as they move, much as electro-cardiograms measure the electricity generated by the heart as it contracts.

A weed is commonly defined as ''a plant in the wrong place.'' But that's not quite right, either. Your oak tree may be a touch too near the porch, but that does not make it a weed. To a gardener a weed is any plant with unfair, sneaky habits; a villainous guttersnipe of a plant that dodges and ducks like a pickpocket in a crowd.

This lampoon of the cinéma-vérité school of filmmaking, which is literal and takes everything seriously, is literal and completely unconcerned about the ability of most moviegoers to relate to its far-out spoofs. Despite its English subtitles, these haphazard vignettes of youthful, dedicated zanies at work is more athletic than funny, more mysteriously spirited than satirical.This fictional ribbing of the young camera aficionados who have become a small cult in Parisian cinema circles in recent years is not precisely new to New York. It was filmed as \\"Dragées au Poivre\\" (which might be loosely translated as \\"Peppermint Candy\\") and became the closing entry at the first New York Film Festival last year. But the uninhibited happenings on which a covey of these movie buffs train their hand-held cameras are never equal to the sum of their parts. And the adventures are largely \\"in\\" jokes for the cult.Stemming from the supposed total recall of one of this free-swinging crowd, the swiftly moving kaleidoscope takes a viewer to a tennis match in which an old pro is beaten by an amateur. The intrusive cameramen then shift to a couple of fathers discussing their infants. Then we have the omnipresent photographers recording the activities of prostitutes and peeping toms in the Bois de Boulogne, after which the search for the truth about the human condition quickly moves into a charm school for women run by an obvious homosexual","excerpt":"a weird tryst of two strange lovers; a Mack Sennett bagnio scene in Place Pigalle; a telephonic passage of amour between a sad Parisienne and the Legionnaire who is her erstwhile lover, and, finally, a press interview with a young, laconic Method actor.Guy Bedos, who plays several roles, including that of the narrator, tennis amateur and Method artist, and Jacques Baratier, the director and collaborator with Mr. Bedos on the script, must be given top marks for effort and energy. They have made their cast whirl about with the speed and élan of happy dervishes. But apart from an amusing sketch here and there it is sound and fervor signifying very little.Mr. Bedos is witty and cute as the mumbling leather-jacketed Method actor who confesses he would like to play Voltaire as a child. Claude Brasseur and Anna Karina are diverting in a slam-bang bit as a naive plumber and a frustrated tart who never arrive at a meeting of either minds or bodies. Sophie Daumier is refreshingly pretty and natural as the dumb but gay prostitute who voices some childishly candid opinions. Jacques Dulfilho is mildly comical as the effeminate charm-school teacher. And, while most of the action is played against a background of rock 'n' roll and twist songs, only a dance \\"rumble,\\" obviously aping \\"West Side Story,\\" is inventive and truly tuneful.The \\"name\\" performers, who happily gave their talents to these oddball adventures, contribute less than memorable performances. Kidding themselves as the Legionnaire and his lachrymose lady, Jean-Paul Belmondo and Simone Signoret belabor a familiar and dull situation. In their tryst, Monica Vitti and Roger Vadim, who are ribbing the weltschmerz-filled lovers of avant-garde film romances, succeed only in being wearisome. And Francis Blanche and Alexandra Stewart, as an excessively German father and his kicks-seeking daughter, give broad and largely ineffective portrayals.\\"Sweet and Sour\\" is neither sweet nor sour. The parody concocted by Mr. Baratier and his willing \\"in\\" group is only tasty fare for a cultist. It is largely mystifying and flat for most moviegoers.

''It is said to derive from imperial court cuisine and was reputedly brought to Japan by a Chinese priest. It was the custom, prior to his arrival, for the members of the sect to go out and beg for rice in the streets. This priest was the first person to have all the monks eat together in a temple.'' If vegetarian cookery can be classified as unconventional, then the shojin meal that Koei Sensei prepared for me and several guests was one of the most interesting, gratifying and delicious unconventional menus I can recall sampling.

Manfully resisting most of the theme's obvious lures, from clattering jute mills to chattering machine guns, the film has chosen to go its way as drama rather than melodrama. And, through the admirable performances of Walter Connolly, Onslow Stevens and a few others, it has gone that way with complete interest and plausibility.It is the story of a small-town doctor whose wisdom, tolerance and gentleness have grown through a score of years in the service of life. His prison offense was part of that tolerance: he had tended and shielded an outlaw simply because he knew the boy and his mother. And in prison, although the young doctor there derided his philosophy and tried to cure him of it, he still insisted that men remained men, whether murderers and thieves, and stood in dignity in the old, old relationship between doctor and patient. In time his philosophy has won another convert, for the young physician is healed of his bitterness and prepares to start afresh.Charles Vidor, who directed it from a story by William Ullman Jr., has spun the story smoothly, spotlighting the prison background in significant bits of action but never letting it overshadow its quiet central figure, the old country doctor. Mr. Connolly has played him wisely and well, with a good trouper's recognition of the faint line between mawkishness and sentiment. Mr. Stevens's portrayal of the taciturn, memory-ridden prison doctor is properly reticent, grave and sincere, and there are well-handled minor characterizations by Bernard Nedell and Paul Fix. Altogether it is far more than we had expected to find behind the Criterion's high grey walls.

It is really about theater. The various participants play parts as ritualized and predictable as those in Japanese No drama or commedia dell'arte. Stock characters feign emotions of hurt and outrage. Behind all the masks, though, the principal feeling is glee -- glee at the publicity, at the opportunity for demagogic posturing and, perhaps most supremely, the special glee that accompanies contempt for those with views contrary to one's own.     That is not to say that the groups that profit in one way or another from the culture wars -- the politicians, artists, cultural bureaucrats, art dealers, A.C.L.U. lawyers, critics and journalists -- share precisely the same motivation. For a conservative politician, the appearance of obscene or sacrilegious art that can be linked to public funds is an opportunity to create an issue. In less prosperous times, a Republican candidate might bait a liberal opponent over taxes, crime or welfare. But those issues have been settled for the moment by a potent combination of Clintonism and Rudyism. In boom times, as Pat Buchanan has recently discovered, the only real opportunities for populist rabble-rousing are in the realm of culture. The National Endowment for the Arts-Robert Mapplethorpe controversy broke in 1989, at a similar point in the business cycle, shortly before the end of the Reagan boom.

Cadet Indicted in Rape"},{"year":"1924","title":"The most stirring chapters in Richard Barthelmess's latest vehicle, \\"Classmates,\\" are those that were photographed at West Point. They are sincere and informing, revealing the disciplinary mill through which the young men from all walks of life pass before they become officers of the United States Army. One gains a vivid impression of the glories and traditions of the military institution. The fact that John Robertson, the director of this film, received the hearty cooperation of the West Point officers materially adds to the interest of these sequences, without which this photoplay would be rather tame.The life of the budding officers is cleverly traced from the day they enter the academy to the time when they graduate. One is quite affected by the sight of Duncan Irving (Mr. Barthelmess) leaving the precincts of the institution after dismissal. He hesitates as the colors are hauled down and the band as usual plays \\"The Star Spangled Banner.\\" Yesterday when the national anthem was rendered in the Mark Strand everybody in the packed house stood up, filled with the spirit of patriotism and gripped with sympathy for Irving.It is also inspiring to watch the scenes in the old Southern town, where Irving receives the letter notifying him of his appointment to West Point. One can imagine his joy as he almost stands on his head after looking in a dazed way at the West Point flag on the wall of his small room.The audience was intensely amused when Irving makes his first appearance at West Point. He is told to do so many things by the first class cadets that he can hardly follow them in their desires. Out comes his chest, down comes his head, and his feet click together. Later, when he is himself one of the important first class cadets, he discovers Bert Stafford (Reginald Sheffield) as a plebe. Stafford is opposed to discipline, as he considers himself Irving's social superior. Irving examines Stafford's lockers and finds that the towels have not been stacked according to orders. He throws them on the floor, which angers Stafford. Then he notices Sylvia Randolph's photograph in the plebe's room and is depressed as he believes the girl is engaged to Stafford.There is a humorous sequence dealing with mild hazing, when the plebes have to perform for the edification of the first class cadets. The younger men are depicted crouching like frogs, ready to do the bidding of their omnipotent superiors. This causes Stafford to rebel, and only when he insults Irving's father does the latter fling aside discipline and strike Stafford. One blow and Stafford says that he can't see. He has been blinded, and for this reason Irving is dismissed from the academy. This is rather weak, especially in these days, as later one is given to suppose that Stafford had been shamming most of the time.There is a long and rather tedious set of scenes dealing with action in the South American jungle, where Irving and his friends, \\"Silent\\" Clay and Bobby Durable, have traveled to rescue Stafford. Coincidence is piled on coincidence in this stretch, and the idea of hellographing by means of a tin pan stuck in the trees is a strain on one's good nature.Mr. Barthelmess is quite a serious stoic in his acting. He ought to relax more in his expressions and forget the camera. He exudes heroism, and appears to be afraid in some of the scenes to look as he does when away from the studio. He spoils his good looks by his frequent frown and heroic consciousness. Actually the best performance in this production is that of James Bradbury Jr. as \\"Silent\\" Clay. He is so natural—quite the antithesis to Mr. Barthelmess—that one almost forgets that he is acting. Madge Evans is sympathetic and effective as Sylvia. Another good bit of characterization is that of Beach Cooke as Dumble.\\"Classmates\\" was first produced as a film nine years ago, with Henry B. Walthall as Irving, Blanche Sweet as Sylvia, and Marshall Neilan as Stafford. We saw both these productions on the same night. The fashions in the old picture elicited much laughter. Mr. Robertson has brought an old story up to date, but the narrative as seen in the new production is frayed with age.

Belle Bennett, who has distinguished herself on several occasions in mother rôles, contributes a sincere performance in the part created by Miss Beecher. This production, which is now holding forth at the Winter Garden, is an intelligent piece of work, one wherein the story is far superior to the average run of shadow diversions. The acting and the dialogue are not of as high a standard as that in the play, and certain phases of the story have been glossed over, either to avoid the censorial scissors or because of a desire to elicit sympathy.Archie Mayo, the director, evidently realizing that the story would be spoiled unless it was told in shadow form virtually as it was done on the stage, has succeeded, nevertheless, in lending to his picture the necessary changes of scenes, which had to be left largely to the imagination in the original.Miss Bennett figures as Mary Colbrook, the widow of a dissolute man, who is left to care for seven children. Six of the youngsters are hardly in sympathy with their mother's faith in their future prospects, but the youngest, Bill, who has a rough streak in his nature, never doubts his mother. When a piano that had been summarily removed for the nonpayment of the instalments due is returned and Mrs. Colbrook tells her children of receiving a substantial amount of money to tide them over, Muriel, the older daughter, suspects her mother of disgracing the family. The girl eventually discovers that her mother obtained the financial assistance from James Rudlin, a banker, whose private life has caused a great deal of gossip.Muriel follows her mother to Rudlin's office and there the girl denounces Rudlin, who in this instance has loaned Mrs. Colbrook the money because he appreciated her courage in keeping up her spirits.Another angle to the story is that of having a designing sister-in-law, known as Aunt Caroline, who endeavors to alienate the Colbrook children from their mother. She succeeds to a certain extent, but she wants nothing to do with Bill, who she declares is not a Colbrook. It looks as though the older children are going to leave their mother, when something that concerns Bill happens.Bill, a Jolly little fellow who expresses himself in slang wherever possible, chances to have become a favorite with an elderly woman named Miss Crosby, who is reputed to be a miser. She is not popular with anybody but Bill and, possibly, her bankers.Imagine, then, the state of affairs of the Colbrook family, with the older children thinking of going to live with Aunt Caroline, when first the news comes of Miss Crosby's sudden death and then that she has left her vast fortune to Bill. Money turns the tables on Aunt Caroline and Muriel, and the other children are astonished to hear that their mother is going to marry a sweetheart of her schooldays.The excuse made for passing over an incident of Bill's birth is somewhat ridiculous. Then, also, Rudlin is apparently a man with a chameleon-like nature and his conduct is none too plausible. Richard Tucker, however, does well with the part, although there is occasionally a suggestion of a lisp when he talks.Marian Nixon is entrusted with the rôle of the adolescent Muriel. Miss Nixon's voice is not nearly so soft as it was in her first talking pictures. She also appears to have a little trouble with a few words. Blanche Frederici as Aunt Caroline is much too studied in her actions. Leon Janney is capital as Bill. The other parts are moderately well portrayed.Other Photoplays.\\"Ladies of Leisure,\\" a talking adaptation of Milton Herbert Gropper's play, \\"Ladies of the Evening,\\" is at the Capitol.

Ted and his wife, Marion (Kim Basinger), are still grieving over the loss of their two sons in a car accident years before, and their marriage is falling apart. All of this might have made for maudlin, precious melodrama — especially when Eddie and Marion commence their affair — but rather than emphasize the plot, Mr. Williams makes it a relaxed, roomy landscape for the characters to roam around in. The cast rises above the occasional implausibility of the material, and the movie is funny, touching and understated. It is dominated by Mr. Bridges's performance, one of the finest pieces of screen acting by an American man so far this year, a heroically life-sized portrait of wounded narcissism and masculine need. — A.

The idea of the story is a familiar one with some strange fighting sequences. One of the characters ought to have been laid up in a hospital for months from the beating he received, but in a short time he appears without a sign of the blows that had been inflicted by a deputy sheriff, impersonated by the muscular Noah Beery.Lois Wilson impersonates the heroine, Carmel Lee, who falls heiress to a weekly newspaper in Gibeon. It is not a profitable publication, as she discovers when she reaches the small town. Actually it is $200 in debt. Carmel has a nose for news and soon after she takes hold of the newspaper Sheriff Churchill disappears. It is suspected that he has been the victim of foul play, and Carmel by a fortunate chance proves this when she discovers his coat and his badge. She had already antagonized Abner Fownes, the wealthy crook, and he seems willing to make short work of anybody who interferes with his boot-legging business.Luke Cosgrave is capital as Tubal, the old editor of the paper, and Johnny Fox is splendid in the rôle of Simmy, the printer's devil. Simmy does a good deal of the reporting for this publication, and he is lucky in being on the scene at the eventful moment. Raymond Hatton gives an interesting performance as a professor, who is an absentminded creature with a sterling heart. He is beaten unmercifully by Deputy Jenney (Noah Beery), but is one of those heroes who is a glutton for punishment.Miss Wilson rather overdoes meditation in quite a number of scenes. She is attractive and fairly natural, except when she appears to be conscious of the camera. She fires a shotgun at the marauders and they only feel very uncomfortable. They are also careful to give her time to reload the weapon.One of the features in this picture is a \\"Handsome Man Contest,\\" which is quite weird.

Here is a melodrama built upon the outmoded story of the criminal lawyer who gets away with murder in the court room, but is trapped when he essays a bit of foolproof homicide on his own. Yet, despite the familiarity of the theme, its energetic cast carries it through to the preferential rating of interesting and fast-moving screen melodramas.Charles Bickford turns in another colorful and virile performance as the Kirk Allen who plots the perfect crime, but he alone does not hold up the picture. There is valuable support from Sidney Blackmer as the prospective corpse, from Helen Vinson as the femme who must be cherchez'd, from Onslow Stevens as the district attorney and Dudley Digges and John Darrow in the lesser rôles.Perhaps this corner is being swayed into a favorable verdict by its willingness, at the moment, to listen to any court-room story","excerpt":"a willingness which can be attributed solely to its absorption in the Hauptmann trial. If this be treason to filmgoers, let them make the most of it. The coroner is very human.Here, at any rate, there is no mystery about the criminal. The audience sees Allen commit his crime. And, when he wins a disagreement, the only question left is how the district attorney can make good his boast to bring him to justice. The answer is a frame-up, but the lady with the scales and sword and the blindfold over her eyes is served. Mr. Bickford as Allen takes the blow more philosophically than we should under the same circumstances; we should have yelled \\"foul\\" and accused the district attorney of being an old meanie.The story's pace is swift, the court room scenes are good, the reasoning clear—to an extent, and a murder, suicide and attempted murder are committed before the audience's popping eyes.

Using these scenes as visual bookends, Mr. Sulik's rueful, quixotic film spends the rest of its time identifying the major landmarks in Tomas's life. This appealing Slovakian film is more wistful than dramatic, but Mr. Sulik's direction recalls the poetic delicacy of Czechoslovak cinema at its best. \\"Don't play what I sing, I haven't got a good ear,\\" Tomas tells his son, summing up the film's intuitive spirit. \\"Play what's in my head.\\"   Tomas's head is filled with a lifelike array of unmade choices and unresolved family problems. The very ordinariness of the issues he contemplates gives them a certain inviting familiarity, which Mr. Sulik explores with quiet precision. \\"Everything I Like\\" offers a drily witty amalgam of minor crises, tied together by the director's eccentric overview and by Tomas's bemused outlook on his own troubles. When he decides to stop eating during the period spanned by this story, Tomas is tackling the situation about as actively as he knows how.

Mr. Mandelbaum's ''Light and Shade,'' in its New York premiere, proved delightful - an exquisitely crafted setting of four poems by Susan Fox for soprano, piano, oboe and English horn.   Miss Willig attended George Washington University and later participated in Catholic University's Opera Workshop. She studied with Todd Duncan in Washington and later with Alice Howland and Cornelius Reid in New York.   The soprano uses her well-trained, expressive, somewhat pallid voice with skill and picks her material carefully. Her interpretations grew in stature as the evening progressed","excerpt":"a wistful, melting performance of Satie's ''Je te veux'' drew an ovation.

And that sure skill at character portrayal that the Gallic performers seem to have in an almost incredible abundance (when well directed) shows clearly in this film.Actually, this terse investigation of seven assorted jurors' private lives as they sit in solemn judgment on a woman accused of the mercy killing of her paramour is simply a study of the natures and the reactions of human characters when called upon to render a decision involving the straight interpretation of law and morals. It is a crisp and absorbing demonstration of how people generally respond to the moral aspects of a situation according to the sort of people they are. And, as such, it becomes an exposition of consummate social irony, for the question it leaves with the viewer is whether justice or unfairness has been done.Assembled for this investigation by Andre Cayatte and Charles Spaak are seven jurors called to do service at a court of assizes in Versailles. There is a hard-headed, middle-aged farmer who must leave his spring planting and his wife to the doubtful responsibility of an indolent Italian farmhand. There is a jolly, self-confident cafe waiter","excerpt":"a wistful, philosophical middle-aged man; a stiff-backed, retired army colonel and a wretched father of a dangerous problem child. There is also a middle-aged woman still questing hopefully for love and a gent who is trying to ditch a mistress so he can marry a wealthy bourgeois girl.M. Cayatte, who directed the picture, and M. Spaak have also brought in as specimens of human nature a punctillious presiding judge, the members of the families of several of the jurors and a handful of witnesses, most notable of whom is a young man who has been an acknowledged alternate lover of the accused. And, finally, they have dropped into the drama the woman charged with murder herself to serve as a magnetized substance that attracts or repels sympathy.Whether the courtroom procedure as evidenced in this film is faithful to the usual French custom, we wouldn't be able to say. We are told that M. Cayatte and M. Spaak were both lawyers before they turned to making films, so we wouldn't like to question the conspicuous eccentricity of practices—such as the casualness with which witnesses are allowed to be pleaders in the cause and the freedom with which the jurors are permitted to associate with witnesses.To enter an objection to these aspects might be ironic in its way, too, for the obvious theme of the picture is the doubtfulness of hard and fast rules. And the major fascination of the picture resides and is achieved, anyhow, in the brilliance and colorful variety with which it explores its jurors' lives.In these roles, Marcel Peres as the farmer, Raymond Bussieres as the cafe waiter, Noel Roquevert as the martinet ex-colonel and Valentine Tessier as the middle-aged lady shine, with Jean-Pierre Grenier as the distraught father, Jean Debucourt as the wistful man and Jacques Castelot as the deceitful lover turning in competent jobs. Claude Nollier as the woman on trial and Michel Auclair as her loyal friend contribute astringent portrayals, while Balpetre is intriguing as the judge.

You're not remotely expected to go away believing that bearded Hugh Griffith could ever, for one moment, be the superlative art counterfeiter he is gleefully made to appear, or that he (or his crafty grandfather) could have faked a statuette of Venus so true that it is exhibited in a Paris museum as one of Benvenuto Cellini's greater works.Nor are you expected to credit the wholly theatrical conceit that his daughter, a luscious Audrey Hepburn, could be so morally disturbed and concerned about the fakery being discovered that she secretly and pleadingly persuades a handsome \\"society burglar,\\" whom Peter O'Toole lightly plays, to join her in a desperate maneuver to steal the statuette from the museum.The whole thing is clearly preposterous—as preposterous as the complicated scheme Mr. O'Toole works out for the burglary, or the twist in which he turns out to be a sleuth who has been commissioned to uncover Mr. Griffith's wily game, or the gaily eccentric wardrobe of Givenchy costumes that Miss Hepburn wears.Never mind. It may all be deception—a piece of fictitious trickery as crafty as those phony Van Gogh paintings or the glistening Cellini statuette. It is still a delightful lot of flummery while it is going on, especially the major, central business of burglarizing the museum.Remember that burglary in \\"Topkapi\\"? Well, this is a parody of it—only a parody so deft and delicious it might be an original. It consists of exquisite preparations","excerpt":"a wonderfully wry, romantic scene of Mr. O'Toole and Miss Hepburn discovering love in a broom-closet in the museum (in which they prove, incidentally, to be the most seductive whisperers in films); a grand lot of Keystone Cop clowning by Jacques Marin as the chief museum guard, and a comical performance of a flatfoot by Moustache, a Parisian restaurateur, that catapults him into theatrics as a rival to Zero Mostel.Cheers all around for everybody—for Miss Hepburn, Mr. O'Toole, Mr. Griffith, Eli Wallach, as a wealthy American collector of art, and for the scriptwriter, Harry Kurnitz (who is known fondly as Harry Koverr) and especially for, William Wyler, who directed with humor and style.So let me be serious in conclusion: art may not be deceit, but this is certainly an instance in which deception comes out a kind of art.On the stage at the Music Hall is a rousing summertime revue featuring the usual entertainers—the orchestra, the ballet company and the Rockettes—aided and abetted by the Purdue University Band, which concludes with a smashing musical tribute to the United States Marines.IN \\"Enough Rope,\\" a new suspense thriller from France, a dazzlingly original idea has been coldly over-coiled by some of the most skillful hands in the business.At the helm of yesterday's new arrival at the Little Carnegie is Claud Autant-Lara, the director of such films as \\"Devil in the Flesh.\\" His writers, Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost, are old, brilliant colleagues. A good, trim cast is headed by Maurice Ronet, Gert Frobe, Robert Hossein, Marina Vlady and Yvonne Furneaux. The film is being presented here by Artie Shaw's company, Artixo, which got off to a flying start with another overseas tingler, \\"Séance on a Wet Afternoon.\\"But the person who really matters is Patricia Highsmith, whose diabolically brewed novels have sparked two previous thrillers, \\"Strangers on a Train\\" and \\"Purple Noon.\\" As before, the plot is the thing.A frenzied, middle-aged bookdealer murders his unwanted wife at a bus stop. We see it, the police don't, the case is closed. But a younger man, married to a nagging neurotic, studies the case, snoops around the bookshop and wonders if he, too, could be so lucky. The death of the second wife (also at a bus stop) alerts a sly detective who backtracks to the original crime and proceeds to pit the two suspects against each other in a triangular cat-and-mouse stalk.So far — about midpoint — swell. Nobody but Miss Highsmith could have cooked up a simmering, elliptical deadlock such as this. And Mr. Autant-Lara and his writers have inched the story forward in steady, mounting tempo, with Mr. Ronet, as the desperate younger man, and the portly Mr. Frobe determined to outwit each other and their stalker, Mr. Hossein. The picture is at its strongest and most convincing in two brilliantly staged and played scenes with the two suspects in stealthy confrontation.But then the inevitable happens to \\"Enough Rope\\"—too much. Mr. Hossein's detective abruptly emerges as a slightly sadistic egoist who relishes human squirming and isn't averse to slamming around — or openly attacking — defenseless quarries. And even with Mr. Ronet's innocence obvious (well, almost obvious—not to spill all the beans), it's not enough to satisfy the detective—or the picture.With Miss Vlady, as the young hero's sympathetic mistress, perched on the sidelines awaiting his acquittal, the picture tacks on a cynical and synthetic climax. A twist, yes—at least it's twisted. So is the fadeout—an ambiguous smirk by the real culprit and killer. Enough rope? And how.

At the work's world premiere here, at the Tanglewood Festival of Contemporary Music on Wednesday night, the oboe sounded an A and the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra began to join in, one section at a time, as in an ordinary pre-performance tuning. It was only when Oliver Knussen conducted a gradual fading of the sound that the audience realized it had been slyly inducted into the work itself. Then the soprano, Phyllis Bryn-Julson -- who has been a stunning performer of the composer's works -- began to recite an excerpt from Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\\"   It wasn't like falling down a rabbit hole, but this virtuosic performance by the singer and student players did pull us into an evocative and intoxicating musical universe, born of Mr. Del Tredici's now epic obsession with Alice.

If some of the ballets on camera have been seen in New York before, most of the actual films have not. The \\"Sylphide,\\" for instance, is a Paris Opéra Ballet production that attempts to go back to the original 1832 French version, although the production consistently presented in the United States has been the 1836 version from Denmark by August Bournonville.Tomorrow, the Beacon will present two films made by a West German television producer shortly after the New York City Ballet's 1972 Stravinsky Festival, one of which is George Balanchine's \\"Pulcinella\\" from that festival. The other is the City Ballet in Mr. Balanchine's \\"Liebeslieder Walzer.\\" Thursday brings in Alicia Alonso's \\"Giselle\\" with the National Ballet of Cuba. The 1964 film, starring Miss Alonso, was seen at a gala for the New York Public Library's Dance Collection but has not had general release in New York.The other two films are a 1967 view of the Bolshoi Ballet and the previously distributed and very successful filmed version of Rudolf Nureyev's production of \\"Don Quixote\\" for the Australian Ballet.Meanwhile, we have \\"La Sylphide,\\" starring Ghislaine Thesmar and Michael Denard, both of whom will appear live on stage at the theater tonight in a precurtain pas de deux. Miss Thesmar's husband, the choreographer Pierre Lacotte, first tried to reconstruct the original \\"Sylphide\\" in a production for French television in 1971. Presumably this is the same film. In 1972, the Paris Opéra Ballet transferred the production to its stage.If we are to believe the rather inaccurate handout provided by the Beacon, Mr. Lacotte discovered a long-lost notation of some of the original choreography by Philippe Taglioni and much of the original score by Jean Schneitzhoeffer in an attic belonging to a godchild of the son of Marie Taglioni, who created the title role March 12, 1832 in Paris. Because modern audiences have been familiar only with totally new choreographic versions or the 1836 Bournonville recension with a score by the Danish composer Hermann Lowenskjold, Mr. Lacotte's attempted reconstruction is, of course, of great interest.Alas. It is so stylistically and dramatically out of kilter with what we know about Romantic ballet in general and \\"La Sylphide\\" in particular that it is difficult to have confidence in the authenticity of the choreography itself.The story and the structure are identical to the Bournonville version—the Taglioni version survived into Petipa's day in Russia. In this film version, James, a Scottish farmer, is still torn between his fiancée, Effie (Laurance Nerval), and the sylphide","excerpt":"a woodland spirit.Yet here, so wrongly, the sylph is made to appear no different from the mortals around her. The crucial distinction, that she wears toe shoes while Effie and her friends do not, is not maintained. All are on pointe.Repeatedly, James gathers her in his arms and partners her while the dramatic point is that she must die at the human's touch. In Act I, a strangely modern pas de trois, in full Antony Tudor psychological style, shows James interchangeably partnering the two women in his life.Stylistically, of course, 19th-century Romantic ballerinas could not turn so quickly on their toes or keep their legs up so high. Nor did the man have such bravura dancing. What Mr. Lacotte has done is not try to replicate authentic style, but possibly to give us some of Taglioni's choreography. His Sylphide certainly darts around much more than her Bournonville counterpart, and she works harder, too. This film is worth seeing for every balletomane precisely because it is so wrong-headed.

The curtain  rises on a long single line of dancers stretched diagonally across the stage, certainly not a novel idea but never quite so boldly stated.         The impact of that image, alluded to in Peter Martins's new \\"Reliquary,\\" comes from the stillness of the dancers, the way the line cuts through space and the amount of open air around it. And everything that follows in this strangely  constructed but invigorating ballet, created for the company's 1972 Stravinsky Festival, has the same pulsing energy and surprise. There is an uneasy tension at all times between the shifting masses of 10 demi-soloists and 16 corps dancers and the 6 soloists who wind through the crowd. Only two soloists have an extended time in the spotlight, in a languid, almost dreamlike pas de deux cooled by the dancers' odd-angling limbs.

Her tempos, slower than a glacier, allow her to move through the emotional moods of her pieces as if in a dream. Because she rewrites so much of her material, completely remaking standards, the familiar, which draws a listener in, becomes the new, as if a memory had been somehow transformed. And when she lets fly, her tempos hurtling along, she brings in her audience by the simple athleticism of her performances. Ms. Carter, at age 62, is jazz's finest singer.   But that's esthetics. For years, Ms. Carter, who is appearing at the Blue Note in Greenwich Village through Sunday night, has been providing the jazz world with immaculately disciplined sidemen. A stint in her trio is a badge of achievement. Ms. Carter is also one of jazz's finest small-group arrangers, and she will change tempos, meters and keys in midtune, and abruptly. She'll season a teen-age musician in just a few months. With the death of the drummer Art Blakey in 1990, Ms. Carter has become jazz's finest university as well.

Some are bloused at the ankles, like parachutists&#8217; uniforms (an effect that can easily be duplicaled by pushing standard straight&#8208;leg trousers into short boots), and some are cropped various intervals from above the knees to above the ankles. Attaching the pants to shirts or blouses and creating the jumpsuit, much the way some clever manufacturer in the early part of this century attached shirtwaists to skirts to create the dress, is another way designers give pants new interest.

But the Chrysler Corporation took that risk by recently allowing dealers, journalists and others onto its test track to give them a glimpse of the 1993 mid-size models on which Chrysler is pinning its hopes for a recovery.    The slump in car sales and the national recession, which coincide with yet another big push by the Japanese for American market share, is squeezing Detroit and causing a torrent of cash to flow out the door. All of the auto makers are cutting costs and conserving resources. What they are struggling to avoid, though, are any deep cuts that would delay or eliminate new products. A Matter of Perceptions     Chrysler, like the others in the Big Three, does not want investors, suppliers or lenders to get the idea that it is paring spending for new models, a perception that would only worsen its problems on the showroom floor.   The pressure to spend, even when money is scarce, is a matter of market share for the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, and a matter of survival for Chrysler. All three are striving to avoid having their need to save money force them into canceling or delaying important vehicle projects. G.M. on Monday announced plans to float an issue of preference stock to raise $600 million, partly to pay for future vehicle models, among them eight new-car and thee new-truck models in the next year.    \\"Spending for new products must go on in good times and bad,\\" said James B. Fitzpatrick, a G.M. vice president for communications and marketing. \\"It is our lifeblood.\\" Cash generated internally at G.M. has shrunk from $10.08 billion in 1987 to an estimated $5.27 billion this year, according to estimates by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.    Japanese auto makers can develop a new vehicle in far less time than Detroit can, and they are invading market niches in the United States where they have never been before. Today, for example, Nissan showed journalists its first mini-van, named the Quest. It was designed in California and will be built at a Ford plant near Cleveland starting next April. Last year, Nissan withdrew from the market its Axxess station wagon that was meant to attract mini-van buyers but was a flop.    American auto makers know they cannot compete unless they compress their normal five-year product-gestation period to three years, like the Japanese, and bring out more new cars more frequently. Indeed, the most scathing criticism that could be leveled at the American auto industry would be to say that it was mortgaging the future by scrimping on new-product development.   But new products take money. Depending on the extent of the redesign, the cost of bringing a new car to dealer lots ranges from $500 million to $1 billion.    While G.M. has been able to keep most models on schedule, it has acknowledged a few delays. Rumors among parts suppliers say G.M. has delayed its redesigned S-10 Blazer utility vehicle to 1995, from 1994.  Taking on More Debt     As for Ford, it borrowed $800 million in the first quarter of the year, raising its debt to $8.2 billion","excerpt":"a year ago, debt stood at $4.4 billion. Ford's debt-to-equity ratio on March 31 was 38 percent, compared with 16 percent a year ago. Ford is trying to keep most future models on schedule, but analysts and suppliers say it has delayed the redesign of the Taurus and the Sable models for one year, to 1995.    After Ford announced a first-quarter loss of $884 million, David N. McCammon, vice president-finance, said projects \\"are basically intact, but we always are making timing adjustments\\" to cut costs and looking for ways \\"to get a dollar's worth of new products for every 80 cents we spend.\\"    Chrysler, which has suffered critical losses and has little financial cushion, has the least borrowing power among the Big Three, the lowest relative stock price, and the least ability to put money into new products. But Chris Cedergren, an automotive analyst for J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive consulting firm in Agoura Hills, Calif., said Chrysler more than any other American auto maker might be trying to pull spending forward.    Perhaps because of its well-publicized financial weakness, the No. 3 auto maker must go to the greatest lengths to prove that its $3 billion in cost-cutting is not hampering development of new models. The company renegotiated a $1.5 billion line of credit after the lowering of its debt ratings made borrowing from the public too expensive.    \\"The fear is that Chrysler is cutting into muscle and bone,\\" said Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. \\"But I hope not, because I love the way the L/H looks.\\" He was referring to the code name for Chrysler's 1993 mid-size sedan, which will be sold by the Eagle, Dodge and Chrysler divisions; it will be built, starting next year, at a factory in Bramalea, Ontario.    Other Chrysler vehicles badly need replacement, too. The full-size pickup truck -- referred to by some Chrysler engineers as \\"Festus,\\" the grizzled codger in the \\"Gunsmoke\\" television western -- has not been redesigned for more than 15 years. Chrysler is planning to replace it in 1993.  No Profits, No Cash     In economically healthy times auto makers pay part of their new-product costs with cash from current sales. But with no profits, auto makers must increase borrowings or sell equity. In the last six months, the Big Three have been forced to trim dividends and drastically cut costs to strengthen balance sheets enough to finance new-product spending.    One-time expenses have also been a drain on cash. G.M., for example, was obligated on March 1 to buy $600 million worth of its class H stock from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as part of the renegotiated terms of the sale of Hughes Aircraft to G.M. in 1985.    The three-year labor contract negotiated in the fall with the United Automobile Workers union has become a huge financial burden as well. Under its terms, the Big Three must pay most workers even if they are laid off, a situation that makes labor costs akin to a fixed expense. In previous recessions, labor expenses went down as sales and production dropped, allowing auto makers to keep losses in check.    In 1982, under an earlier labor agreement, the industry was operating at only 62 percent of capacity, yet auto makers were breaking even. But last year, utilization was at 78 percent and still the industry lost about $5 billion in North America, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.  The Cost of Competition     Of course, foreign imports and transplants -- Japanese cars made in America -- were not as much of a factor during the last recession. Vicious competition is hurting the Big Three's ability to maintain prices. Even with much lower production, the auto makers have been forced to continue offering large rebates on most car and truck models -- another drain on cash.    Shorter development cycles for cars like Chrysler's L/H model should help to cut costs, analysts say. Chrysler will have brought the L/H out in 42 months, a 30 percent reduction in the typical development time, helping produce a 25 percent cut in development costs, according to an estimate by Sanford C. Bernstein.    Chrysler believes the length of the cycle will be about 39 months, said Glen Gardner, who heads the project; that compares with the Japanese average of about 36 months. \\"The trick is going to be to get the rest of our projects on this schedule,\\" he said.

Unlike Lully's music, which had defined French opera for the early 18th century, it was extreme, full of jarring modulations and exclamations, expressions that strained the limits of taste. Rameau raised the temperature of French opera.    Some of those musical effects could be heard in a marvelous concert performance of \\"Castor et Pollux\\" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Friday night, when William Christie came from Paris with his accomplished group of early-music performers, Les Arts Florissants. Opening a weekend of performances (with Rameau's \\"Indes Gallantes\\" on Saturday night and a repeat of \\"Castor\\" on Sunday afternoon), the only regret was that the musical drama couldn't have been made visible as well as audible.

No figure of his time played a greater or more creative role than Alfred Barr in shaping the relation that currently obtains in our culture between high art and its public. It was Barr who led the way in making the complex and often resistent achievements of modern art both accessible and intelligible to the large public that now assumes them to be indispensable to its cultural life.

Although it fails to explain why its dedicated aviator-general worked for the Fatherland while scoffing at the Nazi party and its leaders, it is to its credit that it strongly criticizes their rottenness, intrigues, jealousies and hatreds.The import, an adaptation of Carl Zuckmayer's play reportedly revolving about the last days of the late Col. Gen. Ernst Udet, paints a murky and occasionally disjointed picture of a Luftwaffe technical genius who herein is called General Harras. There is no doubt, however, as to the drama's objectives. It strikes at the viciousness of the schemers in the High Command while showing that General Harras, a tall, handsome hero with a sense of humor, has won his medals honorably and openly hates the Gestapo and the industrialists, who are vying for Hitler's favor.As Hermann Goering's World War I comrade in arms, he is caught in the machinations of the corpulent Nazi No. 2 and Heinrich Himmler to gain control of the Luftwaffe in November, 1941. He is shown, too, as being compassionate toward the Jews, who are being slaughtered","excerpt":"a young actress with whom he is smitten; his close aides and the aviators who are being needlessly killed in a Russian campaign he considers unnecessary.He learns at first hand also of the Gestapo's insidiously cruel methods. And, he discovers in a climactic scene that his technical assistant has been sabotaging planes, which killed his fliers, as a desperate gesture to save Germany from further bloodshed. Although General Udet's death was reported as \\"an accident while experimenting with a new weapon,\\" the film clears the matter up differently. General Harras, plagued by conscience, the Gestapo and his aide's altruistic but awesome deed, escapes it all by cracking a bomber just ahead of the pursuing Gestapo bully boys.Curt Jurgens, an actor of regal bearing and classic profile, gives force and vitality to the role of the harassed air chief who is tortured by the signs of doom for his air force, ideals and country. Victor De Kowa is arrogant and hard as the scheming Gestapo nemesis. Karl John is realistically impassioned as Mr. Jurgens' idealistic right-hand man; Marianne Cook, who since has made a film in this country, makes a pretty brunette, dewy-eyed romantic partner for the middle-aged general, while Eva-Ingeborg Scholz, as a sly party wench who has eyes for the general, and Harry Meyen, as a young aviator inspired by the general, are convincing among the supporting players.Mr. Jurgens and his ill-starred coterie are grim reminders of a terrible past.

Agatha Christie is said to have used it as the setting for ''At Bertram's Hotel.'' And many a Seven Sisters student fondly remembers stopping with mother at Brown's when doing the Grand Tour. In late 2005, Rocco Forte, the luxury hotelier, unveiled a £19 million pound renovation to the combined town houses, designed by his sister, Olga Polizzi. As they have in Rome, Florence and St. Petersburg, the team lavishly updated a venerable hotel, a strategy that is laden with peril, since some longtime guests may not want a favorite old hotel to change, no matter how much it might need it.    THE SCENE -- A tasteful, subdued, quiet money feel. A discreet entrance opens to a wood-paneled corridor, a black and white mosaic floor and a long hallway to the small check-in area. The English Tea Room is an Anglophile's fantasy brought to life. Multiple fireplaces, silver trays groaning with clotted cream, homemade jams, crustless sandwiches and freshly baked scones. A gray-haired grandmother in a practical gray suit and sensible shoes hovers over two little girls with bows and print dresses","excerpt":"a young man, stylishly coiffed with bangs and sideburns, hovers over a beautiful young blonde. Donovan's Bar, inspired by the Newton Bar in Berlin, is covered with Terence Donovan's black-and-white photographs. A very cool setting that screams out for Kate Moss, but she isn't there.    THE LOCATION -- One block off Old Bond Street in elegant Mayfair, a short walk from Piccadilly, Oxford Street, Trafalgar Square or the West End.    THE ROOMS -- Natural linens, silks and expensive wood finishes make for an elegant minimalism. The 117 bedrooms and suites are furnished with slight variations -- a timber floor or a window seat or an Art Deco sculpture. New copies of English classics, not a moldy book among them, are a sweet touch, among them Dickens's ''Little Dorrit'' or P. G. Wodehouse's ''Cocktail Time.'' Curl up on the double-width chaise longue under an angora throw and dip into the George Orwell essay (from a 1,369-page collection) ''Gandhi in Mayfair.'' Books are available for purchase, enabling guests to take a reminder of their London trip on the flight home. The room technology is up to date: Flat-screen televisions, Bose iPod docking stations and a comprehensive --but sometimes confusing-- lighting system. Street noise can be a problem, especially during the day, so ask for a room on the courtyard.    BATHROOMS -- Limestone and fresh cut flowers. Suites have flat-screen televisions at the foot of the oversize tub, so guests can soak in leisure while watching Question Time or the latest EastEnders episode. Most rooms have walk-in showers. Suites have double showerheads.    AMENITIES -- For guests not prudently reading in their rooms or having tea downstairs, there is the small but serviceable basement gym with weights and cardio machines. Spa treatment rooms are candlelit and have a soothing décor down to the white-on-white paintings. The Jet Lag Reviver massage uses a pleasant aromatherapy oil blend of pink grapefruit, rosemary and juniper. (A 130-minute treatment costs £135 -- about $260 at $1.93 to £1.) A prepaid connection card is required for Internet access at the hotel's business center. A call to the concierge before arrival secured reservations at some of London's most popular restaurants.    ROOM SERVICE -- The knock is at the door almost before you place the phone in its cradle after ordering morning coffee.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- Albemarle Street, Mayfair, London, 44-20-7493-6020, www.roccofortehotels.com. Like much of London, it is frighteningly expensive, from £295 ($569) for a classic queen to £1,035 for a deluxe suite. (The royal suite is £2,575.)

Four players, close enough in temperament to love string instruments, but different enough to have chosen such different string voices, spend years in confrontation and negotiation before a coherent character is created.   By the standards of quartet playing, the Lark Quartet is just beginning this long journey, though it is already one of the most honored young ensembles. The quartet, founded six years ago, won the 1990 Naumburg Chamber Music Award, the 1991 Shostakovich International Competition and the 1991 London International String Quartet Competition, along with similar awards in Australia, Italy and Germany. The Lark is composed of four women -- Eva Grusser, Robin Mayforth, Anna Kruger and Astrid Schween -- all educated at New York conservatories. They have also been teaching assistants to the Juilliard Quartet at the Juilliard School.

He is alone on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House, taking the second solo curtain call of his career. Coated in gold paint, he has just danced the Bronze Idol in the American Ballet Theater production of \\"La Bayadere,\\" one of the most virtuosic solos in classical dance. He hears resounding applause and cries of \\"Bravo!\\" As he reaches down to scoop up the white peonies flung to him, his face is illuminated by a smile, and his dark eyes gleam.    In ballet, where generations are measured in spans of perhaps 10 years, the audience can, quite literally, witness the arrival of successive generations. Mr. Corella, who joined Ballet Theater this spring, would seem to have a particularly promising future. Already, he is perceived as one of those uncommon cases: a dancer capable of turning performance into sensation. DANCE: UP AND COMING: Angel Corella","excerpt":"A Young Rocket Who's Lifting Off Toward the Stars"},{"year":"1975","title":"You might imagine that anyone would have to be kidding to call a movie \\"The Devil Is a Woman\\" in this day and age. Not at all. \\"The Devil Is a Woman,\\" the British-Italian co-production that opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, means to be quite serious.It has nothing to do with the 1935 film of the same title — the great Josef Von Sternberg-Marlene Dietrich collaboration—nor is it about diabolism. That is, it's not about diabolism as movie buffs in the last half of this century have come to recognize the symptoms: rocking beds, vomit, levitating children and the voice of Mercedes McCambridge running off at someone else's mouth.This \\"Devil Is a Woman\\" was directed by Damiano Damiani, an Italian director whose earlier credits are none too promising (\\"Arturo's Island,\\" \\"The Empty Canvas\\"), but originally it may not have been quite so foolish as it now is. The film seems to have been so badly edited for its American release that it contradicts its own plot at key places. Also, some of the post-sychronized English dialogue is impossible to understand.Behind this cracked facade one occasionally glimpses the traces of an interesting if overwrought intellectual drama of the kind that Europeans take more seriously than we do. The setting ia a religious hostel-convent in Rome, a place that doesn't look much different from thousands of other Roman buildings on the outside but that on the inside suggests a series of sets that haven't yet been fully dressed for a Ken Russell movie.Running the establishment is Glenda Jackson, playing a character named Sister Geraldine, a handsome, frosty-mannered nun who enunciates so perfectly she always sounds as if she were in a speech competition. Sister Geraldine is big on the possibilities of redemption through prayer, group therapy (called \\"community meetings\\"), chastity and various other forms of self-denial.Because of this she neglects her duties at the convent to devote herself to the saving of a motley group of souls who have sought voluntary refuge in her art-deco hostel. Among them are a beautiful young Latin American woman who fingered her right-wing husband for assassination by associates of her left-wing lover","excerpt":"a young Roman prince whose family won't allow him to marry the girl he loves (his sister); a Cuban bishop who sided with Fidel Castro in the revolution, and a Polish monsignor accused of working with the Nazis against the Russians.Into this atmosphere, which is never as charged as it's supposed to be, comes a youngish Italian journalist who has been commissioned by the Polish monsignor to write the monsignor's defense. The journalist, who goes around preaching reason and the therapeutic value of not brooding too much, nearly wrecks Sister Geraldine's world, but he's a lazy fox in the hen house. How Sister Geraldine triumphs is the foggy point of the film.Neither Miss Jackson nor the other performers is especially convincing meeting the film's sometimes operatic requirements, including suicide, self-abuse (a priest's discreet term), fetishism and the like. Moral dilemmas are introduced, labelled and then passed over, like the fancy decor seen by the camera. Nothing is explored in depth. \\"The Devil Is a Woman\\" sort of scratches ideas as if they were minor itches.

It is propaganda for a decent cause, but it is a dramatization that is elementary in its writing and, in the final analysis, it is a theme that is watered down by a familiar plot and trite lines.The script turned in by B. Churskov seems jerry-built as he develops the story of a heroic tank corpsman, who, with his wartime pal, returns to his native village in the Kuban to find the collective farmers happy but unprogressive.

But the conservative die-hards, colorful in native dress, are there to resist, and even his romance with a dairy maid, who considers herself beneath him, is subject to gossip and the hard knocks of his campaign.Semyon Bondarchuk makes a handsome if implausible visionary whose hopes are realized after what appears to be superficial opposition.

Its story, which sends the enormous red dog and his pals, Cleo and T-Bone, out on the road with a traveling carnival, is bland and innocuous, as every hint of trouble is quickly turned into a soothing lesson. The gaudy, unimaginative animation is a step down from the simplicity of the series, and adults may find the cloying harmlessness oppressive. They may also feel a twinge of nostalgic sorrow on realizing that Clifford speaks in the voice of John Ritter. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott 'Clifford's Really Big Movie'"},{"year":"2003","title":"Ed Solomon's directorial debut seems to have been named for the quality it most conspicuously lacks. Yes. Kirsten Dunst, Holly Hunter and Morgan Freeman offer up an occasional wisecrack, but the overall mood is of unrelieved, self-important gravity. Incarnating this is Billy Bob Thornton, speaking very slowly and wearing his hair long and gray, who plays a murderer released from prison after almost 22 years and in search of that cheapest and most exalted of movie commodities, redemption. He finds it, but the movie, in spite of a fine cast and the gifted cinematographer Roger Deakins, does not. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott 'Levity'"},{"year":"2002","title":"Adam Rifkin's lurid and atmospheric film takes place in and around a filthy Los Angeles hotel, home to drunks, prostitutes, ex-convicts and, most poignantly, a forgotten tap-dance artist. Mr. Rifkin, who also wrote the screenplay, has a gift for creating the atmosphere of grimy despair his subject requires, and for leavening the grim proceedings with touches of grotesque humor. But the visual intensity and the relentless degradation visited on the characters begins to feel prurient and dishonest: the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in their misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it. The problem, though, is not that he lacks the courage to contemplate futility and ruin, but that he's just a bit too eager. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott 'Night at the Golden Eagle'"},{"year":"2000","title":"Mike Figgis's astonishing new film, shot in a single day with hand-held digital video cameras, tells four stories simultaneously, in real time. ''Time Code'' is at once a mordant satire of the hypocrisy and self-delusion of the film industry and an earnest declaration of faith in the medium itself. In addition to its technical innovations, which test the limits of the human eye, ear and mind, the film boasts some brilliant improvisational acting from its enormous cast. Especially fine are Jean Tripplehorn and Stellan Skarsgard, whose strongly emotional performances add a measure of pathos. Whether ''Time Code'' will ultimately be seen as a bold prophecy of the dawning visual age or as a passionate, gimmicky curio is for the future to decide. At present, though, it's hard to think of a more exciting demonstration of the inexhaustible possibilities of film. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott A Digital Prism Refracts Reality"},{"year":"2000","title":"Andre Techine's sprawling, emotional love story is the kind of movie that makes you work a little. It takes time to figure out the relationships between the characters, to say nothing of their motives and feelings. But like so many of Mr. Techine's movies, ''Alice and Martin'' repays the effort. The unlikely, complicated passion between Martin, the troubled illegitimate son of a wealthy industrialist, and Alice, a brittle violinist, unfolds against an equally complicated and sometimes overcrowded background of family secrets and shifting domestic alliances. Juliet Binoche and Alexis Loret are superb in the title roles. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott A Divided French Family, Unhappy in Its Own Way"},{"year":"2001","title":"Michael Cuesta's film is named for the Long Island Expressway, which stretches from the East River to the Hamptons. Howie Blitzer (Paul Franklin Dano), a troubled suburban teenager living in Suffolk County, gets his kicks by breaking into houses, a pastime that gets him into hot water with a character named Big John (Brian Cox), a middle-aged pederast who is at once the film's most sinister figure and its most sympathetic adult. Mr. Cuesta explores the queasy ambiguities of Howie and Big John's relationship with an impressively delicate touch, but Big John's perverse charisma leaves the picture with no place to go. Once Howie's predicament reaches a critical point, the filmmakers, as if speeding toward the nearest exit, wrap up the story with a big emotional confrontation and a burst of violence that is all the more unconvincing for seeming morally justified. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott A Sinister Sociopath, But Still Sympathetic"},{"year":"2002","title":"In this mordantly funny collage of middle-class Palestinian life, Elia Suleiman, with a mournful, deadpan countenance (and without a word of dialogue), plays a character named E.S. E.S. visits his father in the  hospital and meets his lover in a parking lot near an Israeli checkpoint,  while his alter ego, the director, excavates the absurdities of occupation  and social relations in Nazareth, Jerusalem and Ramallah.  The film is a series of elegant visual jokes, interrupted by two elaborate fantasies of   vengeance and defiance, and organized around the idea that the modern Middle  East is, in unexpected and petty ways as well as the large ones we all know  about, a land of bad neighbors. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott A Tangle of Middle Eastern Hate and Love"},{"year":"2001","title":"An oblique, visually intoxicating story of three sisters contending with low-key domestic distress in contemporary Hanoi. Sometimes the sheer beauty of Tran Anh Hung's compositions gets in the way of the characters, but his gentle, Chekhovian insights into their emotional lives holds your attention. His stately, languid pacing and the gorgeous cinematography of Mark Lee Ping-Bin create a sorrowful, romantic mood. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott Chekhovian Complication For 3 Sisters In Hanoi"},{"year":"2000","title":"At the center of Miguel Arteta's funny, creepy and poignant new film is Buck, a 27-year-old man who inhabits the mental world of a preadolescent boy. As played by Mike White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive, an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend Charlie (Chris Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed careerist. Mr. Arteta's visual sense, Mr. White's insightful script and strong supporting performances from Mr. Weitz and his brother Sam, as well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some time. ''Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore, magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott Childhood Longings in a Grown-Up World"},{"year":"2001","title":"This sequel reunites the Michigan teenagers whose clumsy eagerness to be relieved of their virginity fueled the first picture.  A lot of the humor in this film consists of references to stuff that happened the first time around, though Jason Biggs does encounter some novel forms of sexual humiliation, including the painful misapplication of some super-adhesive glue. The rest of the cast members return, some of them quite briefly, for more of the dirty-minded, curiously sweet-natured scenes that are the secret of the franchise's success. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott College Guys in Heat Leap at a Cool Summer"},{"year":"2001","title":"Richard (Peter Sarsgaard), a lonely young Internet entrepreneur, skips out on his company's big initial public offering and pays a stripper named Florence (Molly Parker) $10,000 to fly to Las Vegas with him for a few nights of kinky indulgence. It's not as much fun as it sounds for the participants  or for the audience. Nor is it meant to be. The movie, directed by Wayne Wang from a script he wrote  with the novelists Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt under the collective pseudonym Ellen Benjamin Wong, is one of those films, often considered  a French specialty, that takes sex so seriously as to make you wonder why anyone would bother with it. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott Contracting for a Sexual Fantasy, With No Addendum for Emotions"},{"year":"2002","title":"In this charming exercise in intergalactic multiculturalism, Stitch, the snaggle-toothed, ill-behaved result of an alien genetic experiment, crashes to Earth, where he is adopted by a young Hawaiian girl named Lilo. The pair must contend with extra-terrestrial law enforcement and a nosy earth-bound social worker, and their triumph over these adversities involves the usual Disney blend of comic anarchy, musical numbers (this time with an Elvis theme) and heart-tugging sentimentality. The movie's family relationships are addressed with low-key realism, and the animation has a lovely, gentle precision, with plenty of room for visual comedy but less of the noise and chaos that have become the hallmarks of 3-D animation. This movie suggests that old-fashioned, flat, painted kind still has much to offer. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott Escaping Deep-Space Exile and Making Friends in Hawaii"},{"year":"2000","title":"The latest film by this Iranian director, widely considered one of the greatest living filmmakers, is oblique, evocative and visually stunning. Abbas Kiarostami's views of hillsides, valleys and gnarled, solitary trees seem almost otherworldly in their clarity and depth, and his story, about a morose engineer who has come to a remote Kurdish village on an enigmatic mission, is as simple and mysterious as a folk tale. This is one of those rare movies that completely absorb your attention and demand your concentration while you're watching, and that stay in your thoughts, growing richer and more powerful, for a long time afterward. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott Finding the Beauty of Life In a Rural Corner of Iran"},{"year":"2000","title":"Karen Kusama's debut feature is a fierce, sweet, somewhat predictable boxing picture, with a novel twist that makes all the difference: the contender is a young woman. What makes the movie something more than a smart, feminist sports movie (which is already something) is the presence of Michelle Rodriguez in the leading role, an angry Brooklyn teenager named Diana Guzman who finds dignity and discipline in the ring. Ms. Rodriguez is like a female Marlon Brando, with an overpowering, slow-burning charisma that few actresses of any era can match. Her performance is a knockout. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott Floating Like a Butterfly, Stinging Like a Bee"},{"year":"2004","title":"Ra'anan Alexandrowicz's film, shot in unpretty video, is about the moral conflict between religious idealism and the crude materialism of the modern world. James (Siyabonga Melongisi Shibe), a devout young African Christian, is sent to Israel on a pilgrimage, but is taken for one of the many illegal migrants who come to that country looking for work. He winds up living in a cramped apartment with other immigrants, who are hired out for menial labor by a businessman named Shimi (Salim Daw). The contrast between James's guilelessness and the duplicity and corruption of Israeli society is a bit heavy-handed, as is the story of James's material rise and spiritual fall. But Mr. Shibe is a smart and subtle actor who draws you into his character's predicament, and at its best the film has the sad, generous glow of genuine humanism. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott For One Earnest Pilgrim, No Land of Milk and Honey"},{"year":"2002","title":"Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a C.I.A. superassassin suffering from amnesia, who is chased across Europe, in the company of a charming German waif (Franka Potente), by his employers. There are espionage writers who use the genre to explore the complexities of geopolitics, but Robert Ludlum, on whose novel this competent, enjoyable picture is based, was not one of them. At a time when thrillers are shadowed by real-world anxieties, the implausibility and irrelevance of this movie, which amusingly imagines the C.I.A. as a super-competent, virtually omniscient operation, comes as something of a relief. Mr. Damon handles his characters' existential crisis with fierce adroitness, and Doug Limans direction has an old-fashioned swiftness and efficiency.  &mdash","excerpt":"A. O. Scott He Knows a Lot, Just Not His Name"},{"year":"2000","title":"In the course of his long career, Kurosawa, who died in 1998, made a number of great movies. His last film, ''Madadayo,'' released in Japan in 1993, lacks the narrative intensity of emotional range to be considered among his masterpieces, but within its own modest proportions it achieves a kind of perfection. The story is not much: a retired professor in postwar Tokyo lives out his twilight years in the glow of his former students' devotion and declares his unreadiness to say farewell to the life he lives with humor and gusto. But Kurosawa's absolute assurance as a filmmaker and his unabashed affection for his characters make ''Madadayo'' a richly, and in a way inexplicably, satisfying movie. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott In the Serenity of Old Age, He Gains a Moral Splendor"},{"year":"2004","title":"The ostensible subject of this smart, deceptively modest comedy is female beauty, which is also the apparent subject of a documentary made by one of its characters, a frustrated filmmaker named Kate, who is played by the screenwriter Lynne Adams. Ms. Adams's real-life sister, the semi-retired movie star Brooke Adams, plays Kate's sister, a former actress named Liz whose makeover at the hands of her headstrong daughter (Eva Amurri) Kate hopes to record on camera. It sounds complicated, and it is, especially when the made-over Liz attracts the attention of a shy local restaurant owner who is played by Tony Shalhoub, the director and Brooke Adams's husband. But the ramshackle intricacy of the story, which is full of genuine surprises and odd, improvised moments, highlights the movie's most appealing trait, which is the warm, sly individuality it confers on its odd, abrasive and marvelously likable characters. &#151","excerpt":"A.

And so does an actress (Analía Couceyro) playing the director. The film, a Godardian essay on the indeterminacy of memory and the unretrievability of the past, has moments of strange, poignant discovery, but these are mostly obscured by intellectual preening and formal experimentation that seems awkwardly imposed on the traumatic subject matter. &#151","excerpt":"A.

The keen edge of social criticism that characterized masterpieces like ''Nashville'' and ''The Player'' has been blunted somewhat, but Mr. Altman remains an unparalleled choreographer of chaos. Richard Gere, playing a harried, gentlemanly Dallas gynecologist, is virtually the only man in the movie, and his generous performance anchors the film and provides a foil for wonderful supporting turns by Kate Hudson, Laura Dern, Helen Hunt and Shelley Long. &#151","excerpt":"A.

The film, clumsily acted and awkwardly paced, is stretched out to nearly three hours by slow pans across the desert landscape and long close-ups of a man playing the oud. Mr. Gianvito's approach cannot really be called critical, since criticism would require some cogent analysis of causes and events. Rather, he seems to be working from a set of vague but unshakable assumptions about American politics and culture, and he has built his overstated, unconvincing stories from these assumptions rather than from observation and reflection. &#151","excerpt":"A.

A group of prisoners at the Whitehead Correctional facility, including the good-natured Frances (LisaRaye) and the hard-boiled Nikki (N'Bushe Wright), do battle with a corrupt warden and the sadistic captain who dispenses vicious beatings and extorts sexual favors from the inmates. With the help of a shy, sensitive young corrections officer named Michael (Mos Def), they set out to find justice, which, after much bloodshed and a long, half-naked spell in solitary, they achieve with both bullets and lawsuits. &#151","excerpt":"A.

It tells the curious story of what happened to Parsons's body after his death: his road manager, Phil Kaufman (Mr. Knoxville) spirited the coffin away from the Los Angeles airport and drove it out to the desert, where he had promised to set in on fire. Kaufman is pursued by Parsons's grieving, straitlaced father (Robert Forster) and one of the singer's gold-digging ex-girlfriends (Ms. Applegate). Unfortunately, the most interesting character is the dead guy, and the movie is too flat-footedly anecdotal to reveal why anyone would care so much about him. Happily, the soundtrack, with a handful of Parsons classics and covers, provides a clue. &#151","excerpt":"A. O. Scott We Love Him.

This might have been amusing, but except for the guilty pleasure of seeing Christopher Walken in yet another unredeemably bad movie, there is very little fun to be had. The movie's crude, dippy humor  seems motivated by a deep contempt for its intended audience of school-aged  children. &#151","excerpt":"A. O.

In the case of Jonathan Kesselman's film, that novelty lasts about as long as those credits. The movie, in which Adam Golberg plays the Jewish answer to Shaft, would have worked brilliantly as a five-minute late-night comedy sketch, but it generates too few laughs to justify its length. The best moments belong to Tony Cox, playing (once again) an angry, foul-mouthed elf. &#151","excerpt":"A. O.

Despite his loneliness and isolation, Noi is part of an international tribe of hollow-cheeked, disaffected young people who populate movie screens from California to Argentina to Japan. He has trouble in school and with his father and grandmother, and  seeks refuge in a romance with Iris, who works in the local gas station/convenience store. Mr. Kari directs this spare, funny-sad story in a witty minimalist style, but after a while, like its protagonist, the film starts  to spin its wheels. Having no particular place to go, it ends with a   cataclysm that seems unduly portentous, gesturing toward a metaphysical   significance that it has not quite earned. &#151","excerpt":"A. O.

R. bursts its ideological cocoon and produces a superb screen drama in \\"Peasants,\\" which began an American engagement at the Cameo Theatre last night. This is the Friedrich Ermler work which shared first prize with \\"Chapayev\\" and \\"Youth of Maxim\\" at the Moscow film festival. Displaying that rich gift for character drawing and narrative conviction that makes the Hollywood product seem like pallid make-believe, it tells the vibrant story of a collective farm on which the old and the new close in a death struggle for the allegiance of the confused peasantry. Although it is stubbornly leisurely by American standards of filmic pace, it crackles with the fires of life and is in the best realistic tradition of the Russian screen.The notable Soviet photoplays have a way of transcending their strictly didactic intentions and giving to their preachments a quality of timelessness. Obviously \\"Peasants\\" has been designed as one of Moscow's weapons in the task of winning the unlettered farmers of the distant provinces over to farm collectivization. It holds the kulak or land-owner up to popular scorn by presenting him as an enemy of the people and it pictures the head of the collective as a noble courier of the benevolent Stalin dictatorship. But, far more than this, the work is a vital and earthy chronicle of the men of the soil in their struggles between tradition and a new way of life.\\"Peasants\\" is additionally effective, among its other dramatic virtues, because of its skill at avoiding the temptation to paint its heroes and villains in those relentlessly primitive colors which marred the earlier Soviet preachments. Thus the kulak who is sowing the seeds of sedition among the simple peasants is described with really extraordinary sympathy. We see him as an embittered and broken man, whose brother has been executed by the new régime, whose mother has been driven into hiding and who is himself in daily fear of banishment or death. He begins his subversive campaign against collectivization when the peasants begin to grumble over the government's inability to provide food for their livestock. His young wife, who is intensely patriotic to the new order, drives him insane when she tells him that the son she will bear is to be dedicated to the reborn Russia. Beating her unconscious during their quarrel, he drags her body to the barn and hangs it from a rafter so as to create the impression of suicide. Thereafter he inflames her dull-witted brother to a pitch where the fellow assaults the young commissar and strives to blame his wife's death on the collective.There is an intensely touching scene in which the commissar, faced with the growing spirit of rebellion among the farmers, preaches his simple and eloquent funeral oration over the body of the dead woman. The photoplay is likewise enormously attractive for its warmly human Russian sense of humor, which makes for such comic scenes as the boisterous debate of the peasants over the hog situation and that priceless episode at the dinner table when the committee gorges itself into painful satiety on meat dumplings. \\"Peasants\\" is not above slyly satiric digs at capitalism, as when the peasant, contemplating the face of an especially unlovely hog, remarks that such a phiz would be considered notable even in the bourgeois strongholds. All the players give excellent performances, but there should be special applause for Nikolai Bogolyubov, as the young commissar","excerpt":"A. Petrov, as the murderous kulak; E.

In every other respect, the homeland has rendered a neat, flavorsome version of Chekhov's satirical short story. Coupled in a feature package with a recent Chekhov predecessor, \\"The Anna Cross,\\" the result would have been little short of inspired.Neverthless, by applying taste and deftness to a featherweight content, this Sovexportfilm production and Artkino release manages to keep ???ating, most of the time. Nobody, least of all Chekhov, intended it to soar. With ironic, droll awareness of human gullibity and self-righteousness, he described how a report of murder galvanized some bumbling, provincial officials into an increasingly absurd wild goose chase. The humor, the dialogue and the very physical appearances of the excellent cast in the film easily drop into place off the printed page.The same goes for the setting, a turn-of-the-century village with a cross-section of interiors and exteriors fetchingly tinted in Sovcolor. Better still, as the search for the culprit assumes fantastic proportions, director K. Yudin retains the author's own detachment and a sensible, unlagging camera awareness.With the denouement altogether obvious from the first scene, the picture still jogs along comfortably.For our money, N. Erdman, the scenarist, has even enhanced an otherwise verbatim transcription with two really funny Rabelaisian touches of his own.
