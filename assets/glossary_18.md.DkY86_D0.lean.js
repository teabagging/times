What she didn't know is that I would love it and hate it. I hated it when I was in a cabin with the pungent odor of the neighboring dairy farm and slaughterhouse wafting across my cabin. I loved it when, after complaining about the smell, I was upgraded to a room at the other end of the property, where I looked out on miles of turquoise waters, coral reefs and several other cabanas (which is what 9 Beaches calls its cottages on stilts). I might have simply left the hotel had not a couple from New York, Richard and Claudia Belfiore, celebrating their 10th anniversary, told me that they, too, had changed rooms because of the disturbing odor. Still, I am grateful to 9 Beaches, which opened in May 2005. It made it possible for me to see Bermuda, a magnificently craggy island only 90 minutes from New York, for about $300 a night (a steal on an island where rooms for $600 and more are common). And it let me see Bermuda in shorts -- cut-offs, not the island's starchy namesakes.    THE LOCATION -- At the west end of the island, 9 Beaches is nearly an hour from Bermuda's only airport, by minivan ($20) or taxi (about $50). Even after you reach the resort, transportation is a problem. Since there are no rental cars on Bermuda, you have to rent a motorscooter (expensive and dangerous on Bermuda's narrow roads), rely on taxis or minivans -- which don't always come when they supposed to -- or stay within the hotel grounds.    THE ROOMS -- There are 84 cabins, and each is a kind of tent, with vinyl and canvas walls, on a deck overlooking the water. The furniture is pure Pier 1. There are air-conditioners, but on the hottest days they're not up to the job. There are no telephones in the rooms","excerpt":"cleverly, each guest is issued a Bermuda-only cellphone on arrival.    AMENITIES -- The property is stunning, and with its nine beaches, you can easily have one to yourself. The ''surf shack'' offers a variety of water activities that will dramatically increase the cost of your vacation (an hour-long jet ski tour is $105). But mountain bikes are free.    FOOD -- Breakfast (a buffet included in the room price) and dinner are in the main building; lunch is served at a patio on the beach. One night, I had a terrific mahi-mahi, followed by a crème brûlée that wasn't the least bit brûlée ($28 for the entree, $10 for dessert). Service was often maddening. On my first night, my entree took 80 minutes to arrive, and the manager offered to comp my meal before I even thought to ask. One alternative is the Salt Rock Grill (441-234-4502), a seafood restaurant with a terrific sushi bar, two miles away. But the resort's energetic staff works hard to make up for its all-too-frequent errors.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- Prices drop a bit on Oct. 31; until then, they range from $294 (the standard rate of $240 plus 7.25 percent tax and a mandatory 15 percent ''gratuity'') to more than $400 -- depending on location. And location really matters here. If you can only get a cabana numbered 1 through 23 -- on the portion of the property near the dairy farm -- you may want to stay home. (No. 24 through No. 84 are in the clear.) Changing rooms after arrival isn't always possible. David Dodwell Jr., the resort's resident manager, said: ''On some days, the smell does come over to a small part of the resort. We do try to honor guest requests; if we have availability, we absolutely will move people, unless we're completely booked up.''      Bermuda's currency, the Bermudian dollar, is fixed at the value of the United States dollar, and credit cards are billed in United States funds.      9 Beaches, 4 Daniels Head Lane, Sandys Parish, Bermuda, (441) 239-2999, www.9beaches.com.
