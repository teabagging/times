He lived the thrill vicariously through a former minor league teammate, Francisco Cabrera, when Cabrera's pinch-hit single in the 1992 National League Championship Series propelled the Atlanta Braves into the World Series. \\n\\n     At age 27, Mordecai is old for a major league rookie. But he never lost sight of his dream, and tonight he lived it. With the game tied at 4-4 in the top of the ninth inning, two outs and a 3-0 count, Mordecai, who was pinch-hitting, got the green light to swing. He is a fastball hitter. The Colorado reliever, Darren Holmes, threw one right down the middle of the plate, in search of an easy strike. Instead, Mordecai smacked the ball right back through the box to center  field, driving in Fred McGriff with the winning run.
