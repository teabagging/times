It's easy to forget just how good Roman Polanski's CHINATOWN (1974) is. Robert Towne's screenplay is as smart as the picture is stylish, and the stars are in fine form. Jack Nicholson plays a 1930's Los Angeles private eye and Ms. Dunaway would be the quintessential classy dame who walks into his office, but someone pretending to be her walks in first. When they do meet, she likes him, even with his recent nose injury. The film's unlikely surface topic is city irrigation, but its real theme is corruption, and John Huston, as Ms. Dunaway's powerful father, makes a thrilling, sickening villain -- Sunday at 8 p.m., Sunday/Early Monday at 2 a.m. and Monday at 5:35 p.m. on AMC.     So few musicals hold up the rape of the Sabine women as a model for courtship, but there it is in Stanley Donen's SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS (1954). This is slightly less horrifying when you remember that the whole thing is based on a Stephen Vincent Ben&#233","excerpt":"t story and that it was Ben&#233;t who decided to pronounce Sabine to rhyme with ''throbbin'.'' The music hasn't held up well, but Michael Kidd's inventive choreography is still intriguing. Howard Keel plays an 1850's Oregon woodsman who goes into town and brings back a bride (Jane Powell). She promptly cleans up the house and her husband's half-dozen unwashed brothers. Although she teaches them how to charm the ladies, the boys feel compelled to kidnap the girls of their dreams en masse -- Saturday at 9 p.m. on Channel 13.

But my motorcycle jacket -- a black leather Belstaff Montana jacket with a snap-down touring collar, to be exact -- has lived more, seen more, survived more, than I have. In the early 1950's, Che Guevara wore a Belstaff on the motorcycle trip through Latin America that turned him into a radical. Belstaff outfitted T.E. Lawrence for his travels in Arabia, Steve McQueen for the movies and the pioneering aviators of the 1930's for unknown adventures. These days, even the Dalai Lama wears one. As a writer, my work has taken me through the alleys of Cairo, floods in Rangoon and the back streets of Rio. I've also shot photographs in the sand dunes of the Sahara and on the peaks of the Himalayas. I don't have time to change with the fashions, and I don't have space for fussy, complicated clothes. I need classics that will be with me forever. I like clothes in which I can see the desert in a crease at the elbow or Highway 1 in Vietnam in a scuff on the shoulder. I don't mind if my clothes look worn or beaten up, as long as they are real and well made. I don't want somebody else living for me; that, I can do myself.

A poll would no doubt show that far more people would agree with President Kennedy - ''In the minds of men the world over, the initials T.V.A. stand for progress'' - than with President Eisenhower, who disliked it so much he sought to ''sell the whole thing'' off to private enterprise. Just try to find an encyclopedia, for example, that fails to portray the T.V.A. as having brought unprecedented growth to an almost hopelessly backward region.        But some analysis of the T.V.A.'s first half century seems to show such praise, now elevated to national mythology, to be almost entirely unjustified. According to two current critics, approaching the issue from different perspectives, the ideas on which the T.V.A. was built are fundamentally flawed and will lead to similarly bad results when applied elsewhere in this country or in underdeveloped countries of the third world.

B. King's on New Year's Eve. The Godfather of Soul spent the first part of 2005 recovering from prostate surgery and fielding lingering questions about his much publicized 2004 marital strife and domestic abuse problems. It was reality TV fodder all the way. Now, this hard-living 73-year-old reportedly has in the works both a ''Ray''-like biopic and a documentary (produced by his wife, Tomi Rae) called ''Life on the Road With Mr. and Mrs. Brown.'' If his legendary stage show has lost some of its kinetic kick -- those legs don't shuffle and split as they used to -- Mr. Brown's huff and growl are as percussive as ever. His band still freezes and blares at the slightest signal from its leader, and he still falls to his knees as the spirit dictates. Shows in recent years have included overenthusiastic dancers, as well as a drooping sequence in which Mrs. Brown wails a few Janis Joplinesque numbers. The rhinestone-bedecked main attraction may stick stubbornly to his biggest hits, but who can argue with a searing rendition of ''It's a Man's World,'' a buoyant ''I Feel Good'' or a stripped-down ''Sex Machine''? The pleading showstopper ''Please, Please, Please'' seems to be a live rarity now, but maybe the mood will strike. For his part, Mr. Brown knows that among other achievements, he continues to be the most sampled man in the rap biz. To trade on his legacy, all he needs to do is to keep making it funky and, of course, stay on the scene.
