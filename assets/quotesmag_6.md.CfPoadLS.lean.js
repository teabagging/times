Such is the case with this batch of Americana, much of it recorded for the first time.   With exquisite timing, Mercury provides music for the new national holiday, Joseph Schwantner's ''New Morning For the World'' (289-411 031- 1), premiered in Washington last Jan. 15, the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. This big, moving orchestral essay, interweaving a spoken text drawn from Dr. King's speeches, proves ideal holiday fare, accessible in idiom and brilliantly scored. The baseball veteran Willie Stargell narrates, as he did during the year in concert; his cover photo, with his Pittsburgh Pirates cap and a tuxedo, doesn't necessarily prepare one for the dignity of his presentation, which, however, remains slightly stiff. Mr.  Schwantner's conception owes much, of course, to Copland's ''Lincoln Portrait'' (1942), also given here, with expert narration by William Warfield. Filling out the disk is an animated work in a slightly more advanced idiom, George Walker's ''An Eastman Overture'' - like the Schwantner, commissioned by the Eastman School of Music and premiered last January. David Effron leads the Eastman Philharmonia in nicely- gauged, vital performances. THE ACCENT HERE IS AMERICAN"},{"year":"1994","title":"It was a warm autumn evening in New York, and members of the fashion industry had turned out to honor one of their own. Flashbulbs popped, announcing the arrival of the beautiful and the famous. The crowd cleared a path for those singled out by the cameras, whispering judgment on the clothes or the hairdos. Passers-by who stopped to stare soon got discouraged and left, unable to identify the designers, models, magazine editors and department-store executives getting out of their limousines. But to those of us who are in the fashion business, the celebrities were familiar, as colleagues with whom we rub elbows in the course of a day's work. Their pictures would appear in the trade papers the next morning. Sporting elaborate outfits and the attitude required to carry them off, they looked -- many of them -- as if they'd gotten dressed with a photo op in mind.   Some 20 blocks uptown and a few avenues west, where the MTV Video Music Awards were in full swing, a fleet of photographers had stationed themselves at the door, scanning the audience as it entered, picking out record-company executives, V.J.'s, directors, agents and managers. In general, the clothes were skimpier here, the hair was bigger and the jewelry more conspicuously fake. The desired effect, it seemed, was disheveled, though no less studied. \\"Who's that?\\" I asked a friend repeatedly as we watched a succession of strangers smile obligingly for the cameras.   The people at the MTV awards would probably have recognized Linda Evangelista or Calvin Klein","excerpt":"chances are that fashion types could have identified Steven Tyler or Bruce Springsteen. Everybody knows Madonna. But apart from the rock stars and the supermodels and a handful of designers, fame that evening seemed provisional, and the famous important only in context. There was no mistaking them, whoever they were: their clothes and their manner telegraphed their status. New York, of course, is made up of dozens of worlds unto themselves, which overlap slightly around the edges. A tourist on a brief vacation from the land of fashion, I contemplated the parade of music-business dignitaries, who wore their celebrity the way I wore the dress I'd borrowed for the occasion -- with concertedly offhanded arrogance and pride, as if to persuade people that I owned it. Hot Nobodies"},{"year":"1985","title":"ALTHOUGH unfinished furniture is sanded by the manufacturer, additional sanding is almost always needed if you want a really smooth finish. This is especially true of outside corner joints and edges, and places where the end grain of the wood is exposed. Sand first with No. 150, then with No. 220, then dust thoroughly.   If you intend to apply a clear finish make sure the piece has no blemishes or flaws that need filling in","excerpt":"chances are these repairs will show through. However, if you are planning to apply a painted finish then patching and filling is not a serious problem. If there are nail heads that have not been countersunk, drive them below the surface so the holes can be filled in.   Use wood filler or powdered wood putty to fill in nail holes (the powdered type, which you mix with water, is easier to smooth out), but if you are planning to use a stain wait until it is applied before filling the holes. Otherwise the putty will stand out prominently, since the stain won't soak into these patches as it does into the rest of the wood. So wait until the stain dries, then fill the holes with a colored wood filler that closely matches the stained finish. If you cannot find a color to match, you can add color to the putty or wood filler to make it match.
