But the truly electrifying performance of \\"Die Walkure\\" on Monday evening, when the work returned to the Met repertory after an absence of three years, made it clear that the debate over production values should have been secondary  all long. Whether one loves or hates Otto Schenk's staging, with its craggy sets by Gunther Schneider-Siemssen and motley costumes by Rolf Langenfass, the real question was whether the Met could assemble casts with both the dramatic acuity  and the vocal power to bring this hulking \\"Walkure\\" to life.

In this offering, which is at the Roxy, there is a social adviser who apparently has power to determine the date on which a girl shall make her social début. You have also the snobbish mother, whose daughter seems to prefer to become the bride of a violinist in a jazz band than marry one of the most eligible bachelors. The musician is an industrious individual, but the eligible bachelor is too fond of the whisky bottle.It is a well-acted picture, but the story is little more than one misunderstanding after another between Joy Stanhope and her violinist sweetheart, Chris Hansen. Nigel Bruce, the English actor, in this his first American film, is cast as Troon, a butler in the Stanhope family. Troon takes a paternal interest in Joy Stanhope, favoring her marriage to Hansen. Alison Skipworth plays the mercenary Gertrude Vanderdoe, the social adviser, who is rather worried about the non-payment of her commissions by restaurateurs, florists and so forth.No matter how wealthy her clients may be, Miss Vanderdoe insists on having her own way. She declares that it is one thing to supply a party with eligible dancing men and another to know how to make them stay at the affair. Be that as it may, Joy Stanhope has her introduction to the élite here, with robust individuals at the door stamping the name of Stanhope and the date of the affair on the hands of the young men. Miss Vanderdoe also sees to it that there is a full quota of males present.First Hansen is disappointed with Joy, then she is exasperated with him and out of pique she finally goes off and is wedded to Jimmy Wolverton, the aforesaid bachelor, who is very, very fond of alcoholic beverages. But he is a good chap and is quite willing to have the marriage annulled so that Joy can become Mrs. Hansen.Frances Dee does well as Joy, who is referred to by Hansen as a \\"Princess of Park Avenue.\\" Gene Raymond is handsome as Hansen. Mr. Bruce is excellent as Troon, who hails from the Highlands. Harry Green affords amusement as an orchestra manager and Marjorie Gateson is charming as Mrs. Stanhope, Joy's mother.The surrounding program at the Roxy includes Walt Disney's \\"Silly Symphony,\\" \\"Just Dogs\\"","excerpt":"a \\"Goofeytone News Reel,\\" and \\"Strange as It Seems,\\" another short film.

An Eye on Society."},{"year":"1925","title":"Those gay, rollicking early days of movie art are recalled by the antiquated technique so skilfully maintained in \\"The Love Hour,\\" Vitagraph's initial contribution to the Greater Movie Season. The gestures and expressions of the players and the gallant attempts at drama are reminiscent of that period when ambitious pictorial offerings received their world-premieres in Fourteenth Street. The story of this audacious reflection of the past is none other than that of the little blond girl, pretty, but so poor, who meets and marries a blasé young millionaire. This production is produced in a modern style—that is the furnishings are up to date and the players wear short skirts and loose trousers.The villain, who is moderately successful for two chapters, gives a sincere imitation of the spiteful sneer and wicked frown of the stage cur of a generation ago. The hero does nothing to deserve being called a hero, and the heroine is a foolish little person. Some of the scenes in this presentation are on a par with \\"The Great Train Robbery,\\" but as it is longer it suffers in comparison.Coney Island of the present day affords some slight digression from the story, but the subsequent happenings are apt to make one inattentive to the shadow characters, which to the producers, would seem ungrateful.In one sequence Ward Ralston, the villain, appears on the threshold of Rex Westmore's sick-chamber with an unprepossessing specimen of a physician. Westmore, the aforementioned millionaire, who encounters financial losses, is told that he will have to go to Switzerland for an operation. Soon one hears that the poor man has not enough money to go to Switzerland, and the villain thereupon seizes the opportunity to offer the necessary funds to Betty, Westmore's wife, provided she divorces her husband and marries him. The woman wishes to conciliate the brute—at least one presumes so—so she permits him to embrace her. Then follow scenes showing Ralston and Betty in the mirror and Westmore looking at their reflection from his bed. It appears to have an excellent effect upon him, as he arises and apparently has no trouble in getting well.And this is an impression of \\"The Love Hour,\\" intended to be representative of the 1925 photoplays! It has gained entrance to the Rialto! You can think of lots of things not in the least connected with this picture while you are viewing it.

For the comedy with music, photographed in subdued colors, which began a stand at the Stanley on Saturday, laboriously strives to prove that the road to romance can be rocky, an idea that couldn't be novel, even in Georgia.M. Baratashvili and L. Hotivari, who wrote the script, and S. Dolidze, who directed this pallid fiction, seem to be familiar with most of the standard film cliches. Their heroine, nicknamed The Dragonfly, is the pretty, hoydenish daughter of the chairman of a successful farming community. She would rather warble the whole day through than win her letter as a Hero of Soviet Labor. Of course, a handsome young architect from Tbilisi, the big town, appears on the rustic scene to give her something to sing about.It is at this point that the scenarists and director toss their old hats into the ring. Our Dragonfly fails her exams at the \\"Institute,\\" our lovesick swain becomes confused and irate when he mistakes our heroine for another lady who is about to get married, has the same name as the Dragonfly and actually is a Hero of Soviet Labor. There are other complications, too, and it takes quite a few songs and standard tribulations before the Dragonfly, now a chastened laborer in the hen coops, and her distraught admirer see through this transparent comedy of errors.L. Abashidze and R. Chekhikvadze are decorative as the lovers and Miss Abashidze gives a lively if uninspired performance in the title role. D. Abashidze and F. Chakhava, as a farm worker and his teasing fiancée, manage to inject a bit of comedy into the otherwise commonplace proceedings.

M. Chevalier won hearty applause and soon after he had disappeared through the curtains the spectators were bubbling with merriment over the actions of Leon Errol, Mitzi Green, Zasu Pitts, Jackie Searl and Lilyan Tashman in the talking picture which was directed by Norman Taurog and Norman McLeod.Finley P. Haddock (Mr. Errol), his wife, impersonated by Miss Pitts, and Mildred, their daughter, played by Mitzi Green, are first beheld leaving their Main Street for Paris. One of the first bits of comedy is where Haddock discovers that the brakeman in the club car is quite an expert in wrestling. Haddock is the proud possessor of a medal, which he wears on his watch fob and which he boasts is also for wrestling. The result is that the two men in the otherwise unoccupied car decide to test their prowess and it is not long before Mr. Haddock is ignominously thrown. This is accomplished cleverly and when Mr. Haddock feels that he has had enough of being hurled to the floor, the brakeman undertakes to initiate the panting Haddock into the art of jiu jitsu and once again the Main Street magnate is hurled to the carpet.At the hotel in New York the Haddocks encounter Sidney, portrayed by Jackie Searl, who did so well in a rôle of the same name in \\"Tom Sawyer.\\" As a preliminary to a feud between the two children, Sidney slaps Mildred's face and from then on the girl makes Sidney pay and pay.In addition to the boisterous children, there are the Princess, played by Miss Tashman, and Collins, impersonated by Regis Toomey, who think that it will be a comparatively easy matter to swindle Haddock out of $50,000. And it might have been if Mildred had not been gifted with unusual perspicacity. It is Mildred who by a ruse recovers the alleged love letter her father had written and it is also she who in a wild struggle snatches a check for the equivalent in francs of $50,000, which Haddock had made out to the Princess.Sometimes the comedy in this picture is very effective, but during some interludes it is somewhat lame. Toward the close there is the mirthful manner in which Mildred gets hold of the Princess's check, while in an adjoining room Sidney is left balancing a gold-fish bowl on a stick and blowing a whistle.On boarding the steamship for France, Mrs. Haddock is a victim of seasickness, owing to the rough weather. In vain does her husband explain that the ship has not left the dock. Mrs. Haddock believes that she is about to leave this earth.Mr. Errol is splendid, but he might have been asked to forego the smashing of another costly vase, a similar stunt to that which he did in \\"One Heavenly Night.\\" Mitzi Green makes things thoroughly uncomfortable for Sidney, but she is a trifle too precocious, due chiefly to the dialogue and the direction. Jackie Searl reveals himself to be a clever little actor, but he is also a victim of the lines allotted to him. Miss Pitts is excellent. Mack Swain affords chuckles as a Frenchman with a long beard and no necktie, the lack of which arouses Haddock's keen interest. Harry Beresford officiates as a street cleaner who is introduced ceremoniously to the Haddocks by their taxi driver. He tells the Haddocks that he and his wife could never live anywhere else but New York.\\"Finn and Hattie\\" is an adaptation of Mr. Stewart's book, \\"Mr. and Mrs. Haddock Abroad.\\" The film is also on view at the Brooklyn Paramount.

This roundup of plays pays particular attention to the comfort level for children, including the work's running time and attention spans after the first act. Ticket availability is also addressed. Children might also benefit by listening to a musical's score before seeing it. Tickets for the shows below are sold through the theaters' box offices and the TKTS booths in Duffy Square, Broadway at 47th Street, and on the mezzanine level at 2 World Trade Center. Tickets from TKTS are sold at half the regular ticket price, with the highest price at TKTS at $32 (prices fluctuate)","excerpt":"a $2 service charge per ticket is added. On a recent Friday at 6:30 P.M., tickets were available to all the plays mentioned below except \\"Cats.\\" (There were also very short lines.) The situation was the same at the downtown TKTS booth at 11 A.M. on a recent Saturday, though the lines were considerably longer. TKTS information: (212) 354-5800.  'Cats'  Winter Garden Theater Broadway at 50th Street Manhattan (212) 239-6200 Recommended ages: 4 and up    \\"Cats\\" recently celebrated its ninth birthday on Broadway, which gives yet another generation of children a chance to experience this megamusical. The play, based on T. S. Eliot's \\"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats,\\" introduces a dozen eccentric and eclectic feline personalities. Children of all ages are likely to identify with at least one of the Jellicle cats, who range from the notorious to the nefarious to the misbegotten. The rakish Rum Tum Tugger affects leopard-skin boots and a well-gelled palomino hairdo; children usually keep their eyes glued to him. Grizabella is a skinny gray matted feline who has seen better days but still commands attention with her resonant rendition of the now classic song \\"Memory.\\" Mr. Mistoffelees leaps around the stage in shimmery black and is cool and slick but not scary. Some children are startled at first by the cats' predilection for prowling around the audience; the cats often stop and stare ominously. But eventually some youngsters hope that they'll catch the eye of a cat to be able to, say, stroke its back. For many children, \\"Cats\\" is a riveting spectacle, though the first act pushes the attention span of some, most likely because the play has a minimal plot. The second act, however, revives waning interests; by the finale, young theatergoers seem to develop a strong affection for the cast. The show runs 2 hours and 25 minutes, with a 15-minute intermission, during which youngsters can stroll on the stage or buy a poster, mug or T-shirt. Tickets, at $42.50 to $60, are available for most shows throughout the next two months; Saturday evenings (and the day after Thanksgiving) sell out quickly; better bets are on weekdays or weekend matinees. Evening tickets are harder to get through TKTS than matinee tickets; all are $32. No one under 4 years old is permitted in the theater. Performances are Mondays through Saturdays (except Thursdays) at 8 P.M.; Wednesday and Saturday matinees are at 2 P.M., and Sunday matinees are at 3 P.M. 'The Good Times Are Killing Me'  Minetta Lane Theater 18 Minetta Lane (near Avenue of the Americas) Manhattan (212) 420-8000 Recommended ages: 8 and up    Edna Arkins, the young main character and narrator in this Off Broadway play written by the cartoonist Lynda Barry, has the uncanny ability to sympathize with adults and her peers at the same time. She is a mature but complicated white pre-teen growing up in the mid-1960's befuddled by her parents and seeking friendship, in this case, with a black girl next door named Bonna Willis. Older children will find Edna's and Bonna's growing pains comforting and reassuring: they both manage to rise above the quiet chaos around them. The play lovingly brings to life familiar childhood idiosyncrasies: the fantasy of having one's own nightclub in a basement, the thrill of saying a curse word, hating one's pious aunt, the importance of pop music. And the racial tension that flares up between Edna and Bonna, a result of peer pressure, is timely and enlightening. Children with older siblings will identify with Lucy Arkins, Edna's younger sister, who is used to being mocked and left behind. The theater's intimacy allows the audience to sit close to the stage, which Yvette Grant, a 9-year-old, said made her \\"really feel part of the play, as if it's really happening.\\" The play's credibility is enhanced by abrupt active scenes that recall MTV as well as family arguments. The play is 2 hours long, with a 15-minute intermission. T-shirts designed by Lynda Barry are sold for $15. Tickets are available for the next two months, though Saturday evenings sell out quickly. Performances are Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 P.M., Wednesdays at 2 P.M., Saturdays at 6 and 9 P.M. and Sundays at 3 and 7 P.M. (After Nov. 3, there will be only a 3 P.M. performance on Sundays.) All seats are $35 except Saturdays at 6 P.M. and Wednesday and Sunday matinees, which are $30. (TKTS tickets are about $20.) Discount tickets for children under 18 years old are $20 at the 6 P.M. Saturday shows, with the purchase of a $30 ticket.  'Once on This Island'  Booth Theater 222 West 45th Street Manhattan (212) 239-6200 Recommended ages: 4 and up    This musical's island scenery, featuring spidery palm trees, flowering hibiscus and spooky mountains, lifts young theatergoers from an urban setting into an earthy close-knit Caribbean island. Based on the novella \\"My Love, My Love,\\" by Rosa Guy, a Trinidadian, and also based loosely on Hans Christian Andersen's \\"Little Mermaid,\\" this youthful love story builds slowly and absorbingly to a strong and moving ending. It centers on the tenacious Ti Moune, a girl orphaned by a tropical storm and brought up by her fellow island peasants. She grows from a wiry, willful girl into a loving, kind woman who falls in love with a \\"grand homme,\\" a member of the ruling class. Children become swept up in the gentle but powerful narrative, as Ti Moune and the other peasants sing their beautiful songs and sway to the lusty music. Children follow Ti Moune closely: her fiery soul makes her hard to ignore. The 90-minute play, which has no intermission, delivers touching moments; when a storm hits, the thunder and lightning cause some youngsters to squirm, yet they seem to relish the effects. The characters often speak in a patois, making the dialogue hard for youngsters to understand. But the story is so simple and basic that the dramatic action often conveys the plot. Tickets, which are $32.50 to $50, are more difficult to obtain on weekend nights, particularly on the day of performance, but all seats are available through December. As with other plays, tickets to matinees are easier to buy. TKTS tickets are usually $27. Adult-size T-shirts, for $12, are sold in the lobby. No one under 4 years old is permitted in the theater. Performances are Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 P.M., Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 P.M. and Sundays at 3 P.M.  'The Secret Garden'  St. James Theater 246 West 44th Street Manhattan (212) 239-6200 Manhattan Recommended ages: 7 and up    The elegiac \\"Secret Garden\\" has two main themes: death and revival. Many children might agree with 9-year-old Kristen Checkosky, who said the play was \\"happy and sad.\\" Some children, however, find the subject of death disturbing. One child sobbed recently after the first act. Yet many youngsters still find the play mesmerizing, with its Victoriana scenery and Monet-like dreaminess in the final secret garden scene. Daisy Eagan, who plays the recalcitrant but endearing Mary Lennox, whose parents die within the first few minutes of the play, is a character children seem proud of: she is not swayed by adults. As a heroine, Mary rouses her bedridden cousin, Colin, out of his down-filled bed and startles her despondent Uncle Archie out of his miasma. Mary herself is transformed, like the roses in the secret garden. The first act is composed of eight scenes and four opening short scenes that whirl like a Viennese waltz. Men and women in fancy dress act as ghosts; they are not terribly scary to youngsters because they seem so real. For children unaware of the book's plot, the diffusive first act can be confusing. The narrative stirs up their emotions, but it isn't very clear to some youngsters. Some explaining by parents, for example, about who Colin is, why he is in bed, who Archibald is and why Mary is sent to him, may be needed. The second act, with 10 short scenes, is more understandable to young theatergoers, with Mary's need for love and friendship satisfyingly resolved. The play runs 2 hours and 40 minutes, with a 15-minute intermission; T-shirts and refreshments are sold in the lobby. The theater provides cushions to sit on during the show. Young theatergoers are likely to benefit from reading Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel before they see the show or hearing a plot synopsis from parents. And because the play is long, it may be best to see matinees. Tickets for most performances over the next two months are available, though the weekend evening shows, along with the orchestra seats, sell out first. Tickets will probably become scarcer on holiday weekends. Tickets are $35 to $60; the TKTS price is usually $32. Performances are Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 P.M., and Sundays at 3 P.M. Miss Eagan does not perform on Tuesday or Wednesday evenings; Kim Mahon appears instead.

By contrast, the atmosphere in the larger of the two galleries set aside for Mr. Smith's work is calm, airy, even a trifle chilly. The dozen paintings, a promised gift from the 87-year-old artist to the museum, are all of a piece: smooth of surface, spare but often vivid of color, and eccentrically geometric. It is clear at a glance that they require time and attention from the viewer, in the form of both close-up scrutiny and a slow, contemplative 360-degree turn from the center of the room.

He was flaying his own performance on a song from the night before, when Phish played the first of two sold-out shows at the Great Woods Center for the Performing Arts in Mansfield, Mass. \\"I was listening to what I was playing and thinking, 'God, this is totally awful,' \\" he said to Mike Gordon, Phish's bassist, over lunch in a Boston restaurant. \\"Then I listened to how I was singing the lyrics, and I thought, 'God, this is awful, too.' \\" He shook his head, appalled but grinning. \\"I'm never doing that song like that again.\\"\\n\\nOver the last 12 years, Phish's devotion to what it calls its \\"musical evolution\\" -- especially in its generous, anything-goes live shows -- has been instrumental in transforming a college-circuit cult band into one of rock's most popular grass-roots success stories. In 1994 the band did $10.3 million in ticket sales, landing it among the industry's top 50 grossing acts. Phish's five-album catalogue on Elektra sold more than 500,000 units, without the benefit of a Top 40 single and with only minimal exposure on MTV. The band capped off its year with its debut on \\"Late Night With David Letterman,\\" followed by a Madison Square Garden show that sold out in four hours.

This miniature plastic replica is said by its manufacturer, the Testor Corporation of Rockford, Ill., to be \\"a scale model kit of the alien craft allegedly hidden in Nevada by the U.S. Government, as described by eyewitness and former Government physicist Bob Lazar.\\" But the original craft is not just any U.F.O. It is nicknamed \\"the sport model\\" by Mr. Lazar, who has claimed to have worked in 1988 at a classified air base in central Nevada referred to by some as Area S4. There, he has asserted, he worked as part of a Government team, \\"reverse-engineering\\" one of nine alien craft, taking it apart to determine its technology. The model, which retails for $24.95, has been selling out at hobby stores, particularly since the talk-show host Larry King displayed one two months ago during his show about U.F.O.'s, broadcast from just outside the base. \\"We are selling them as fast as we can make them,\\" said Nancy Rainwater, a company spokeswoman.\\nTHE ORIGINAL: It is described by the company as an \\"anti-matter reaction, gravity-amplification, interstellar craft,\\" made of an unknown substance. Mr. Lazar has said that the anti-matter reactor bends space-time and is fueled by what he called Element 115 (the latest addition to the terrestrial periodic table is Element 111, announced by German physicists just last month).\\nTHE MODEL: Made of plastic, it is 13 inches in diameter when assembled (compared with 52 feet for the original).

They include one of the F-117 Stealth fighter, which he made before the Government even acknowledged the Stealth existed; that kit has sold 700,000 units, believed to be the most for any plastic model kit ever. Last year, he turned out a model of the Aurora, the new breed of supersonic spy plane said to be housed at the Nevada base.\\nSOURCES: Mr. Andrews consulted with Mr. Lazar and Jon Farhat, a computer-graphics designer who is working on a movie about Mr. Lazar. Mr. Lazar has claimed that he saw the saucer fly, though never higher than 40 feet off the ground. His personal credentials have not checked out (he has said that the Government destroyed his educational records, from the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology).\\nRELIABILITY: As for the existence of the craft on which the model is based, Testor has carefully said, \\"We can neither confirm nor deny.\\" And the Government?

They were encouraged to express their thoughts on preserving the environment, providing food and shelter for everyone and dealing with the technological challenges of the future.    A reception will be held today from 3 to 5 P.M. at the center, on Old Bedford Road in Golden\\"s Bridge. Viewing hours are Mondays through Fridays from 9 A.M. to 10 P.M., Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. The phone number for more information is 232-5740. NEWBORNS ON THE FARM     Springtime at Muscoot Farm, when new baby animals and birds are in profusion, is a treat for young children. At 2 P.M. today the staff will conduct a program in which children will see newborn baby calves, lambs, piglets and newly hatched chicks. There will be demonstrations of feeding and care, children can see the chick hatchery and they will be able to feed corn kernels to the older ducks and geese.    The farm is run by the County Parks Department on Route 100 in Somers. There is a picnic area, and admission and parking are free. To reach the site take I-684 to Exit 6, go west on Route 35 to Route 100 and turn left. Proceed one-and-a-half miles to the entrance. FOLK MEETS METAL     The four members of Boiled in Lead perform an intense brand of rock on a variety of instruments, applying their unusual style to traditional folk tunes, to original material and to samplings of Serbian, Armenian, Swedish and Thai music picked up on their travels.    They will give a concert on Friday at 9:30 P.M. in the Towne Crier Cafe at 62 Route 22 in Pawling. Admission is $12.50. Call 855-1300 for more information.

This two-CD collection starts with Ms. Carter and her family in 1939, and ends with a family singalong in 2003. Her tangy voice held a growl that led her at first toward comic songs, often about straying men. She wrote at least one country classic, ''Ring of Fire'' (with Merle Kilgore). But she was more collaborator than star, releasing only three albums of her own. Carter Family songs are included, 1950's singles, her hit duets with Cash and her entire 1975 album, ''Appalachian Pride,'' her fullest statement about heritage and the present. What's missing is a fuller selection from her later albums","excerpt":"a 1999 version of ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken,'' sung solo to an acoustic guitar, finds the song's mournful essence. JON PARELES    ''DARK HOLLER: OLD LOVE SONGS AND BALLADS'' (Smithsonian Folkways). Recorded by the folklorist John Cohen in Madison County, N.C., in the early 1960's, these are traditional songs about love and murder usually traceable to England, a century or more before, but sung in a style rooted in the region: the singers all stretch out, irregularly, on vowels of their choosing, and add upturned yips to the end of stanzas. The best of the seven singers on the album, Dillard Chandler, is the subject of a beautiful black-and-white 1970 documentary film by Mr. Cohen, included here on a second disc. BEN RATLIFF    ''DRIVE-THRU RECORDS GREATEST HITS'' (Geffen) Sure, punks have hearts. Drive-Thru Records, a Southern California label, realized this a decade ago, and it can take considerable credit (or blame) for the upsurge of ultrasincere punk-pop that now battles hip-hop for time on MTV. The label signed bands whose adenoidal, sensitive-guy lead singers pour their hearts out over blaring, surging guitars, raising their voices to declare, ''I want you to know that I miss you,'' as Finch does in ''Letters to You.'' Pop far outweighs punk on this collection; there's nothing sloppy about the music. In the 1980's, songs from bands like Senses Fail, New Found Glory, Midtown or Something Corporate would have been self-important power ballads instead. Annoying as they can be, they still sound better revved up to a punk doubletime. PARELES    EAZY-E, ''ETERNAL E: GANGSTA MEMORIAL EDITION'' (Priority/Ruthless/EMI). Eazy-E, the rapper who died 10 years ago, isn't memorialized quite as enthusiastically or as often as Tupac Shakur or the Notorious B.I.G. But his tough rhymes and not-quite-friendly jokes still reverberate: this year, the Atlanta group Boyz N the Hood built a song, ''Gangstas,'' around an old Eazy-E sample. This CD repackages his greatest hits and fan favorites, including a few from the hugely influential N.W.A. catalog. It should give young hip-hop fans a chance to enjoy not only his genre-defining hits (including ''Boyz-N-the-Hood''), but also his novelty songs, his sometimes flat-footed rhyme style and -- on a bonus DVD -- his music videos. KELEFA SANNEH    EMINEM, ''CURTAIN CALL'' (Aftermath/Interscope). Sometimes a greatest-hits CD is a milestone, or a chance to rediscover an underdiscovered body of work. And sometimes, as in this case, it's a stopgap. For the last few years, Eminem has sounded and seemed increasingly uninterested in being a rap star; this CD may buy him some time. It gathers excellent old tracks (plus some less excellent, less old ones) and adds a pair of new songs, which both suggest that some battery-recharging might be in order. ''When I'm Gone'' tells the gloomy tale of a rapper who worries that he treats his fans better than his family. The other -- and this is saying something -- is simply one of the most sexually explicit songs Eminem has ever released. SANNEH      SHIRLEY HORN: ''BUT BEAUTIFUL: THE BEST OF SHIRLEY HORN'' (Verve). Verve, the jazz record label, had a good run with the jazz singer and pianist Shirley Horn. Lifting her from near-obscurity in 1986 -- her career had already completed one cycle -- the company treated her slow, lavish, rainy-day music with respect, sometimes giving her strings, sometimes just letting her record with her two longtime backing musicians, the bassist Charles Ables and the drummer Steve Williams. This single-CD retrospective is a monument to second-phase Shirley Horn: only one track predates her 1980's comeback. It was planned before her death in October; subsequently, Verve decided to add three tracks of her final concert engagement, at Le Jazz Au Bar in New York, and they're all medium-tempo or faster. She could swing, too. RATLIFF    REBA MCENTIRE, ''REBA #1's'' (MCA Nashville). It's easy to underrate Reba McEntire, a remarkably consistent country singer -- and, these days, sitcom star -- who wears her country identity lightly. Whether she's accompanied by a steel guitar or a synthesizer (or both), her focus is elegant storytelling. These two discs present her remarkable run of hits (not all of them, despite the title, No. 1 hits), nearly all of them melancholy; she uses her strong, sprightly voice to hint at the happiness that came before, and will come again after. The two new songs evoke more cheerful situations: happy motherhood and happy couplehood; here's hoping she hasn't given up on failure. SANNEH    NEW ORDER, ''SINGLES'' (London/Warner). This double-disc compilation efficiently compresses the career of the pioneering British pop group New Order, which was formed from the ashes of Joy Division. After a couple of post-Joy Division tracks, ''Everything's Gone Green,'' from 1981, sounds like the big bang: audacious proof that mopey new-wave, brutal machine-music and buoyant electro-pop could coexist in the same song. For the rest of the decade the band produced a series of danceable hits, some big (''Shellshock'') and some huge (''Confusion''). Disc 2, mainly devoted to the 1990's, feels like an epilogue, though a worthy one. SANNEH    ''THE ESSENTIAL TITO PUENTE'' (RCA/Legacy). The average person will find a Tito Puente boxed set too cumbersome. The average person, then, needs this: a two-disc, 40-track, astutely chosen sampler of Puente's recordings on RCA Victor and Tico from 1949 to 1962. It is his greatest work, and some of the greatest recorded music of the 20th century. Here is the translation of mambo dancing into wickedly powerful Afro-Cuban jazz, with space built into the arrangements and brass and percussion sections moving through like scythes. The set includes the best of Puente's tiltings toward straight jazz and Cuban religious music; the rest forms the blueprint for what became New York salsa.  RATLIFF    ''SHAOLIN SOUL: CLASSIC SOUL SOUNDS THAT INSPIRED THE WU-TANG CLAN'' (Koch). RZA, the sullen-voiced, logorrheic rapper and mad-scientist producer from the Wu-Tang Clan, could be a rough man on a sample. Setting the armature of a song, he'd take a really great old piece of soul music -- say, the New Birth's ''Honeybee'' -- and step on it, breaking off an instrumental bit to refashion it as a tone-clashing background, snipping a blip of singing to bang into a loop like a keyboard note. In the past you sometimes had to go to bootleg LP's made for D.J.'s, like the ''Ultimate Breaks and Beats'' series, to find the sources he uses -- old songs by Ann Peebles, Al Green, O. V. Wright, the Emotions, the Sweet Inspirations and so forth. This disc is on the up-and-up (the tracks have been licensed from their original labels), and collects 14 of RZA's source songs in full. If that's all too nerdy for you, take away its pretext and it's a great soul mixtape. RATLIFF    SONIC YOUTH, ''GOO: THE DELUXE EDITION'' (Geffen) When ''Goo'' was released in 1990, its relatively concise, verse-chorus-verse songs made the album seem like Sonic Youth's turn toward a pop mainstream. In its deluxe-edition reissue, with a second disc of demos and outtakes, it's back to sounding strange. For all its collegiate rock imitators, Sonic Youth was nobody's mainstream: not with its unpretty vocals, its oblique lyrics and the music's core of bristling, frenzied, disorienting drones created by retuned guitars. The demo versions are less dense than the finished songs: sometimes sketchier, turning into loosely psychedelic jams, and sometimes wilder (as in what became ''Mildred Pierce''). In a 1990 ''interview'' at the end, free-associative monologues from Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon explain just a little.  PARELES    ''THE ESSENTIAL SONNY ROLLINS: THE RCA YEARS'' (RCA Victor/Legacy). In 1962, the tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins returned to the studios, fresh from a break spent practicing and thinking over his position in the jazz scene. For two and a half years, under contract with RCA, he defined himself as an even more probing and capricious improviser than he had been before. The set includes the best parts of fascinating, canon-resisting records made with the guitarist Jim Hall, Ornette Coleman's group minus Mr. Coleman, and Coleman Hawkins; there are also a couple of albums exploring old-at-that-time standards and recent-at-that-time standards. It's all deeply intelligent music.

The 18 works in \\"42d Street Art Project\\" are on view 24 hours a day.    Most participants set out to contribute work that in some way parodies, examines or celebrates some aspect of this sordid yet vital corner of Manhattan, now on the brink of being radically changed by an urban renewal project that may or may not work. The problem is that too many of the artists' efforts simply blend in and all but disappear. There is definitely such a thing as being too site-specific.

The opening flourish, on Wednesday, used the brassy swagger of popular 20th-century suites by Prokofiev and Bernstein and a group of reflective Strauss songs to present the orchestra as a sleek, flexible symphonic engine. By contrast, the season's first subscription concert, on Thursday evening, showed off the orchestra's virtuosity from a different perspective. Here, in a program of early-19th-century works, reflectiveness ruled, but not to the exclusion of power and electricity.   Thursday's program, which is to be repeated tonight and on Tuesday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, offered music that would have been new but not alien to the audience at the orchestra's debut in 1842. Mr. Masur's centerpiece, the Beethoven Fifth Symphony, was the debut concert's opening work. But the occasion was only the work's second New York performance. Schubert's \\"Unfinished\\" Symphony, Mr. Masur's opener on Thursday, was composed 20 years before the Philharmonic's debut (but did not have its premiere until 1865). And Etienne-Nicolas Mehul's Symphony No. 1 in G minor, though a novelty today and one worth hearing, it turns out, was fairly popular in the early 19th century.

He was a significant influence on Bertolt Brecht's epic theater and, of course, provided the basis for Alban Berg's opera \\"Wozzeck.\\" Had Buchner lived longer, modern drama might have begun at least a quarter century before Ibsen and Strindberg.

The play's free-thinking, skeptical mockery of social customs and its celebration of women who ignore them are so modern that it is difficult to believe it was written by a Spanish courtier before 1630.    Don Manuel, a nobleman, arrives in Madrid on business at the royal court and stays with a friend, Don Juan, whose palace is also home to Do&#241;a Angela and their brother, Don Luis.

For a former foreign correspondent — and an editor with reporters dispersed around the globe — this is a discussion with decidedly extra-literary implications. While we try to assign correspondents overseas who are fluent in the relevant language, there is no way that a paper as serious about international news as The Times can operate without interpreters. Many, many interpreters. As a reporter, I’ve worked with native interpreters of languages from Armenian to Zulu, and have come to believe that the craft of working with an interpreter is at least as important in our line of work as the mastery of languages. The obvious imperative in working with a translator is to get the facts right. (Witness the recent dispute over what Ahmadinejad actually said about gays during his speech at Columbia University.) But beyond that, it’s about getting the voice right. The quality of a translation goes not just to accuracy of detail or intent, not just to felicity of language, but to clarity, nuance and credibility. An intellectual who makes a powerful point in Polish or Pashto can sound less convincing in a clumsy translation.

What should you do if your own priority is to transform a dreary room without spending a fortune? Here is a sampling of advice from leading architects and interior designers who have confronted all these challenges -- and more.\\nEstablishing Priorities\\n\\n \\"When planning a house, make sure to include the details, like storage. Otherwise, it's like having a marvelous-looking car with a motor that won't turn on,\\" warns the New York interior designer David Anthony Easton. Timing and budget, large or minuscule, should always be considered at the start. \\"If there is a brake on spending,\\" says the interior designer David Mlinaric, of Mlinaric, Henry and Zervudachi in London, \\"people must ask, 'Shall I have one really good thing rather than five average ones? Shall I do some now and some later?' \\" Establish limits and a specific focus, or, admonishes Bernard M. Wharton, an architect with Shope Reno Wharton Associates in Greenwich, Conn., \\"You'll open Pandora's box and be redoing everything.\\" \\nArchitectural Interest\\n\\n If the budget can support architectural changes, most experts agree that they should be made a priority before decoration. \\"Do as much to embellish the architectural background as possible,\\" suggests Mario Buatta, the New York-based interior designer. \\"Then you can paint it and never have to change it again.\\" Also try to work with existing elements. \\"In a room that's in bad shape, maybe just change the ceiling by adding ornamentation,\\" advises Lee Mindel, an architect with Shelton, Mindel & Associates in Manhattan. \\"Or cut out the center of the old floor, insert new flooring and use the border of the old to frame the room.\\" The New York interior designer Mark Hampton makes it a priority to correct any architectural flaws, whether by changing the molding around a window or installing a fireplace. If the plaster walls are flaking and cracked, but the budget precludes adding anything more than a picture rail, Sam Blount, an interior designer with the Manhattan firm of Irvine & Fleming, recommends mirroring to add dimension and depth.\\nBasic Furniture\\n\\n \\"Beware of fashionable pieces that won't last,\\" cautions the French architect Patrick Naggar, of Nile Inc., in New York. \\"Buy only a few items, but very good ones.\\" Adds Lee Mindel, \\"You don't need to do \\n\\neverything \\n\\nat once. Instead of a fully furnished room, concentrate on one good upholstered piece, like a couch covered in Fortuny fabric.\\" Once the basic creature comforts have been installed, new furnishings can be added at leisure. \\"You can use orange crates as coffee tables, but don't skimp on the basics,\\" says Betty Sherrill, president of McMillen, the New York interior design company. (Sherrill still has the couch she and her husband purchased 42 years ago for the then-princely sum of $200.)\\n\\nA basic grouping of a couch and side chairs will make a design statement, as well as provide seating. At the very minimum, notes Gary Hager of Parish-Hadley Associates, the Manhattan interior designers and decorators, \\"You can live with just a sofa -- it adds volume -- but it's a bit hard to live with three unupholstered side chairs.\\" He advises drawing up a plan for furnishings first, then making purchases within that framework. If a limited budget prohibits buying new furniture, perk up the old with simple, relatively inexpensive tricks. Patrick Naggar suggests, for instance, tossing a \\"wonderful cloth\\" over a tattered sofa. If you are redoing a room, Mariette Himes Gomez, a Manhattan interior designer, advises making a priority of something you could not afford to do the first time, whether it is replacing an old coffee table or adding an Oriental screen.\\nBathrooms\\n\\n\\"The rooms that you are in most, especially baths, should be as functional as possible,\\" says Mario Buatta. \\"If you don't set things right in the beginning, such as replacing fixtures, you'll end up living with them unhappily or ripping them up years later.\\" If money is a constraint, treat the decor like that of any other room and use classic design tricks to hide faults. A fresh coat of paint, or drapes and a matching shower curtain, can change the face of an old bathroom and draw attention away from defects like an ugly tub and crumbling tiles. \\"Place a collection of objects you love on a window ledge,\\" recommends Libby Cameron, an interior designer with Parish-Hadley. \\"Hang prints on the walls, or add plants or even simple rag rugs.\\" More whimsical solutions are suggested by Michael Graves, the Princeton, N.J.-based architect: \\"Place the shelves on a wall, to make random waves a la David Hockney, or stencil blue, white and gold onto the tiles.\\" \\nKitchens\\n\\nIn order to accommodate budget limitations, the New York architect Alan Wanzenberg suggests making a master plan for the design, including within it cost-saving options, such as less expensive cabinetry materials. You can also postpone the purchase of new appliances, he adds, or use inexpensive but functional ones that can be replaced eventually.\\n\\nWhen redoing the ubiquitous small kitchen, the New York architect Walter Chatham recommends blurring the limits between it and the adjoining rooms. \\"It can never be more than it is in terms of space,\\" he explains, \\"but take out as much as possible. If there is a convenient wall outside the kitchen, move a table out there and use it as another surface.\\" The traditional space-saving tricks are still invaluable, such as a work table on wheels or additional shelving installed above existing cabinets. \\"Add a touch of color to a kitchen, whether it is a painting or a piece of pottery, and de-institutionalize the room,\\" suggests Libby Cameron.\\nChildren's Rooms\\n\\n\\"A child's room should be the best model for a life lived in one room,\\" says Frances Halsband, a New York architect with Kliment & Halsband. \\"It has to accommodate sleeping, 'entertaining' and 'work.' \\" A simple wallpaper border and gaily painted wicker furniture are inexpensive solutions to the decor. Beautiful design, however, is not as important as storage. Walter Chatham suggests items a child can manage, such as giant drawers on wheels or accessible shelves. Libby Cameron proposes decoratively painting an armoire (available at tag sales or unpainted furniture stores), which can be refinished as the child matures and has the bonus of portability. \\nLighting\\n\\nIf no natural light is available, Michael Graves suggests creating the illusion of a skylight with incandescent lighting recessed behind a ceiling panel. Even an enlarged poster of the painting \\"Open Window\\" by Matisse, he adds, can provide the impression of a vista. \\"Lighten surfaces by directing a wash of light toward the ceiling,\\" recommends Walter Chatham, \\"but avoid built-in light fixtures.\\" The combination of rich color and attractive lighting in a dim space can also creatively conquer the darkness. \\"You can take an undistinguished corridor, paint it taupe and install surface-mounted down-lights with 75-watt bulbs,\\" points out the New York-based interior designer John Saladino. \\"Focus one of the lights on a fragment of an Oriental textile, and you have created magic.\\" \\nStorage\\n\\nMaking storage areas an integral aspect of the architecture is a refreshing solution to this age-old need. The New York architect William McDonough, for instance, designed hidden storage in the deep side walls of the small passageways between a series of rooms in a prewar apartment. Recessed shelves and cabinets are built into the walls, covered by painted-wood doors that look like panels. The rooms themselves have frosted, glass-paneled doors, which, when open, completely conceal the built-in structures of the passageway, while adding an architectural element. With a bit of creativity, other overlooked areas can also be turned into functional space. Sam Blount, for example, created a tented office at the end of a dining room. When the curtains are down, the area appears to be a tented wall, but when they're up, the office benefits from the airiness of the entire room. Betty Sherrill recommends furniture for additional storage. A hassock will hold papers as well as provide comfort","excerpt":"a beautiful chest will add not only a focal point to a room, but also a place to keep linens or clothing.

that \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" survives even the naked spotlight of having won the Grand Prix du Cinema Français. A stirring, full-bodied and tremulously beautiful screen edition of Louis Hemon's now classic novel of French Canadian life, it presents the Gallic cinema at the top of its achievement. The photoplay captures the soul of that strong and simple race which has clung bitterly to its heritage and guarded its identity during 300 years in the New World. \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" preserves the integrity of the Hemon work with a skill that gives the film the nobility of an epic poem.Far more than the emotional history of one girl, this is the drama of the frontier—French Canadians at war with the powerful forces of corruption that eternally threaten the race. Maria Chapdelaine's father, religiously rooted in the land of his fathers, has insisted on exposing his wife and their children to the rigors of life on the fringe of civilization. Although the Winters are cruel, he will not move into town. Maria, true to the tradition, falls in love with the gay voyageur who risks his life in the Northern wilderness. But, when one merciless Winter takes both her lover and her mother, she is deeply shaken and almost escapes with the young man from the city who promises her an end of bitterness and struggle. But she has her father's belief in the land where her people first broke a virgin soil. In the Spring she will marry her neighbor and bear sons and daughters who will renew the bleak battle for existence.If this sounds uncomfortably morose, I am doing the film an injustice. \\"Maria Chapdelaine,\\" in its description of life as it goes on at the Chapdelaine farm, possesses the vigor, the native wit and the homely warmth of those sons of France. There is a remarkable freshness in the shy and guileless progress of the romance between Maria and her voyageur. The crisis of the drama achieves great emotional power in the parallel scenes where, as Father Chapdelaine begs the forgiveness of his dying wife for exiling her to this wilderness, Maria's suitor woos her with the selfsame appeal to preserve the heritage of her people. \\"Nothing must die, nor change.\\" You will have tears and a furtive pride in the human race during these minutes.There are excellent performances by Madeleine Renaud in the rôle of Maria, Jean Gabin as her voyageur and Alexandre Rignault as the vanquished suitor who finally wins her. But the real stars of the film are the father and mother of the Chapdelaine family, André Bacque and Suzanne Despres. \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" is at the Cinema de Paris, which, by the way, is the former Fifth Avenue Playhouse near Thirteenth Street.

(Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'IN MY LIFE'  Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a storyline poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). The August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY'  Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley).    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone, who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp and at over two hours, it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Broadway    'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, but not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BACH AT LEIPZIG' Itamar Moses's comedy is an ardent but hollow literary homage to Tom Stoppard stuffed with arcana about religious and musical squabbles in 18th-century Germany and knowingly feeble jokes. Despite the nimble gifts of a first-rate cast, the play never works up the farcical energy to lift us over the puddles of book-learning (2:15). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of this great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Anne Midgette)    'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Jason Zinoman)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'FIVE COURSE LOVE'  This musical is merely pleasantly fluffy, and sometimes offensive, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100.( Genzlinger)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'HAMLET' Michael Cumpsty gives a forceful, intelligent reading of the title role in the Classic Stage Company's likably intimate production of Shakespeare's tale of doom-struck Danes. Brian Kulick's production is heavy on the directorial gimmickry (smell the spray paint! watch the set be shredded!), leaving psychology and philosophy to fend for themselves (2:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'HILDA' Marie Ndiaye's play is a psychodrama from which most of the psychology seems to have mysteriously evaporated, taking a lot of the drama with it. Ellen Karas stars as a bourgeois housewife whose obsession with her maid eventually unhinges her (1:20). Part of the Act French Festival. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'IN THE AIR' Historical melodrama about the 1918 flu epidemic is like a soft-focus film on the Lifetime channel (2:15). Theater 315, 315 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'JUNIE B. JONES'  A spirited entertainment (1:30). Theaterworks/NYC, at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200. (Van Gelder)    'MARION BRIDGE'  The Canadian playwright Daniel MacIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Margo Jefferson)    'MEDEA'  The Jean Cocteau Repertory's cliché-ridden modern translation strains to be relevant (1:30). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, near East Second Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'ON SECOND AVENUE' This genial show by the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, celebrating Second Avenue's theatrical heyday, somehow manages to be both a perfect ensemble production and a star vehicle for Mike Burstyn. The production, first seen last March and April, is in its second go-round (2:00). J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' Diminished though it may be by the absence of its orchestra in its 73rd season, it remains prime entertainment (1:30). 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)    'RFK'  This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)    'SEE WHAT I WANNA TO SEE' A hot-and-cold chamber musical by Michael John LaChiusa, based on stories by Ryuonsoke Akutagawa, that considers the nature of truth and belief. The show's film-noir-style first half is more chilly than chilling. But its second act, set in the shadow of 9/11, throbs affectingly with a hunger for faith. With Idina Menzel and Marc Kudisch (2:00). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer Prizewinning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)    'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easygoing to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    'BARTLEBY, THE SCRIVENER' Herman Melville's exquisitely existential short story has been beautifully brought to life at the Blue Heron Theater. From the set, which looks like a Victorian illustration, complete with desks with inkpots and plumes, to the characters dressed in antic black-and-white (reminiscent, say, of a Phiz drawing for a Dickens novel) (1:40). Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban)    'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'COWBOY V. SAMURAI' This adaptation of ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' is set in a small Western town, where an Asian-American English teacher and an Anglo-Saxon gym teacher with cowboy leanings vie for the love of a sophisticated woman (1:45) National Asian American Theater Company, at the Rattlestick theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. (Jefferson).    'DOÑA ROSITA LA SOLTERA (DOÑA ROSITA THE SPINSTER)' Watching Repertorio Español's ''Dona Rosita the Spinster'' is a bit like finding a dried flower pressed in a book: charming, archaic and just a bit musty, even though the lead is played by Denise Quiñones -- Miss Universe, 2001. Frederico García Lorca's poetic play has a predictable premise","excerpt":"a beautiful young woman waits in vain for the handsome cousin she is engaged to. Luckily, the tragicomedy has some laughs (2:00). In Spanish with live simultaneous translation via headsets. Repertorio Español, at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920.

Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'CAMBODIA AGONISTES'  A musical about the Khmer Rouge? It works better than you might think in this revival of a 1992 play: Cambodia's recent history is painted in broad strokes of parody intermingled with a tragic story line. But the most vivid performer on stage is a real-life Cambodian dancer, Sam-Ouen Tes, who doesn't have a speaking role but communicates more than this slightly pale though well-meaning piece (1:30). West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 279-4200.

( Midgette)    'MANIC FLIGHT REACTION' Sarah Schulman's intermittently zingy play is an awkward mixture of cultural satire and earnest psychodrama about love and responsibility. Deirdre O'Connell gives a warm, engaging performance as a reformed rebel with a colorful past that bleeds into the present in sensational ways (2:00). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THE SALVAGE SHOP' Jim Nolan's moving, old fashioned drama, about a fraught father-and-son relationship in a small coastland town in Ireland, delivers an emotional punch (2:30). The Storm Theater, 145 West 46th Street, (212) 868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)    'THE TAMING OF THE SHREW' What could be more apt than the all-female Queen's Company tackling Shakespeare's ''Taming of the Shrew,'' perhaps the most famous war-of-the-sexes comedy ever? But just because Petruchio (and everyone else) is played by a woman doesn't mean that this is a feminist diatribe. In this not very tame production, Bianca is played by an inflatable doll (1:50). Queens Company, Walker Space, 46 Walker Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444, closing Sunday. (Hoban)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AFTER INNOCENCE' (No rating, 95 minutes) Calm, deliberate and devastating, Jessica Sanders's documentary ''After Innocence'' examines the cases of seven men wrongly convicted of murder and rape and exonerated years later by DNA evidence. It confirms many of your worst fears about the weaknesses of the American criminal justice system. (Stephen Holden)    * 'BEE SEASON' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A genuinely felt, finely made adaptation of the Myla Goldberg novel about an 11-year-old girl with an ineffable gift for summoning up perfectly strung-together words. With Richard Gere, Juliette Binoche, Max Minghella and the wonderful newcomer Flora Cross as the family nearly undone by that gift. (Manohla Dargis)    'BROOKLYN LOBSTER' (No rating, 90 minutes) Kitchen-sink neorealism set in Sheepshead Bay: although well acted by Danny Aiello and Jane Curtin, too much of the film plays like a tedious case history from a business school textbook. (Holden)    'CAPE OF GOOD HOPE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) Set in gorgeous Cape Town, Mark Bamford's energizing first feature revolves around a group of animal-shelter workers and their significant counterparts, as they contend with varying states of loneliness and gaping voids in their lives. A genuinely uplifting, satisfying and memorable film. (Laura Kern)    * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)    'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott)    'DERAILED' (R, 110 minutes) A glossy and often risible bit of trash about an adulterous affair gone bad, bad, bad, starring the invaluable Clive Owen and an uncomfortable-looking Jennifer Aniston. (Dargis)    * 'THE DYING GAUL' (R, 105 minutes) Craig Lucas's screen adaptation of his bitter Off Broadway revenge tragedy, is a sublimely acted film and a high point in the careers of its three stars, Campbell Scott, Patricia Clarkson and Peter Sarsgaard, who play a bisexual Hollywood studio executive, his wife and a young screenwriter. (Holden)    'ELLIE PARKER' (No rating, 95 minutes) This corrosive deadpan comedy, crudely filmed in digital video, follows the misadventures of an aspiring actress in Los Angeles. Naomi Watts, in the title role, delivers a small, brave, acting tour de force. (Holden)    'GAY SEX IN THE 70's' (No rating, 72 minutes) Joseph Lovett's nostalgic paean to the erotic utopia of his youth might be more accurately titled ''Anonymous Gay Male Sex in the 70's in Manhattan.'' Within that narrow framework, the film is quite successful, using archival photographs, clips from pornographic films and television commercials, and interviews to evoke the period between June 1969, when the Stonewall riots brought homosexuality out of the shadows, to June 1981, when the AIDS epidemic began. (Dana Stevens)    'GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' ' (R, 134 minutes) This lumbering vehicle for the rap star 50 Cent blends gangster intrigue with follow-your-dream striving. The story is a mess, and the star is no actor, but a fine supporting cast and Jim Sheridan's warm-hearted direction make it watchable. (Scott)    * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)    'JARHEAD' (R, 123 minutes) Sam Mendes's film about marines waiting for action in the first gulf war is often vivid and profane, like the Anthony Swofford memoir on which it is based, and some of the performances crackle with energy. But the film as a whole feels strangely detached and -- even more strangely, given its topical resonance -- irrelevant. (Scott)    'KISS KISS, BANG BANG' (R, 103 minutes) Clever and dumb at the same time, this hectic pastiche of Los Angeles. noir conventions offers opportunities for Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan to have a good time with hard-boiled dialogue, and the audience to have a few laughs watching them. The picture's self-conscious manipulations of tone and chronology might have seemed fresh and witty 10 years ago, but probably not even then. (Scott)    'THE LEGEND OF ZORRO' (PG, 126 minutes) Like most sequels, this successor to ''The Mask of Zorro'' feels obliged to outperform its forerunner by being bigger, faster and more spectacular. That translates into busier, sloppier, less coherent and more frantic. (Holden)    * 'NINE LIVES' (R, 115 minutes) The director Rodrigo Garcia's suite of fleeting but intense moments in the lives of nine women is an extraordinarily rich and satisfying film, the cinematic equivalent of a collection of Chekhov short stories. The brilliant cast includes Sissy Spacek, Robin Wright Penn, Holly Hunter and Amy Brenneman. (Holden)    'NORTH COUNTRY' (R, 123 minutes) A wobbly fiction about a real pioneering sex-discrimination case, ''North Country'' is an unabashed vehicle for its modestly de-glammed star, Charlize Theron, but it's also a star vehicle with heart -- an old-fashioned liberal weepie about truth and justice. (Dargis)    * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)    * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)    'PRIME' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Actually, pretty mediocre. A thin romantic comedy that nonetheless has its charms, most of them provided by Uma Thurman as a divorced 37-year-old who falls for a 23-year-old who happens to be her therapist's son. (Scott)    'SAW II' (R, 91 minutes) Jigsaw, the sicko known for masterminding twisted life-or-death games, returns for a sequel that doesn't really compare to its fine predecessor, though it still manages to be eye-opening (and sometimes positively nauseating) in itself. (Kern)    * 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)    * 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)    'USHPIZIN' (PG-13, 91 minutes, in Hebrew) In this groundbreaking collaboration between secular and Orthodox Israelis, two roustabouts barge into the home of a Hasid and his wife and make comic trouble. (Holden)    * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)    'THE WEATHER MAN' (R, 102 minutes) Yet another movie about a middle-age man gazing into the void of his life; this one was directed by Gore Verbinski and features a fine Nicolas Cage.(Dargis)    'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden)    Film Series    CHILDREN IN THE 20TH CENTURY (Through Tuesday) Symphony Space Thalia Film's international program of films focusing on problems that affect children concludes with Luis Buñuel's first international hit, ''Los Olvidados'' (1950), about a teenager in the slums of Mexico City, and Victor Gaviria's ''Rodrigo D: No Futuro'' (1990), about a teenager in the slums of Medellín, Colombia.

In Woody Allen's ''Another Woman'' (1988), she plays a New Yorker who eavesdrops on psychotherapy sessions. And in ''Love Streams'' (1984), the last film in which she and Cassavetes appeared together, they play a brother and sister struggling with their lives. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10.

(Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    RYAN ADAMS AND THE CARDINALS (Tonight) Seemingly reinvigorated by his new band, the prolific (and hotheaded) alt-country songwriter Ryan Adams has some strong new material that offers stylistic restlessness as a sign of depth and demonstrates his honky-tonk versatility. 8, TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 509-0300; free with ticket (details at www.musicdowntown.org). (Laura Sinagra)    AMERICAN ANALOG SET (Tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday) A more ethereal version of Death Cab for Cutie, this Austin band plays wistful, conspiratorial pop that's more hum than drone. The group has said this tour will be its last. Tonight at 9, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $14 (sold out). Tomorrow at 10 p.m., Sunday at 11 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sinagra)    ANIMAL COLLECTIVE (Sunday) These moody junkyard folk-poppers find a kind of romance in wails and clatter. Their cracked prog jams and urban pastoral chant-alongs map a landscape where fantastical beasts gather for ritual rocking around trashcan campfires. Excepter and Amandine also play. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    INDIA.ARIE, RAUL MIDON (Tonight) India.Arie's combination of soul and folk stylings and be-yourself uplift paved the way for groups like Floetry. The vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Raul Midon has contributed his talents to the work of many Latin pop superstars. He plays his own material here. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; $45. (Sinagra)    BUJU BANTON (Tuesday) Buju Banton is possessed of one of the best voices and hit catalogs in dancehall. Unfortunately, the purveyor of the anti-gay screed ''Boom Bye Bye'' can't seem to leave the topic alone, as he proved at this summer's Reggae Carifest. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sinagra)    CLEM SNIDE (Tonight) Though Clem Snide's nasal wiseacre frontman Eef Barzelay increasingly shows his soft side with pretty tunes influenced by love and fatherhood, this Brooklyn indie rocker hasn't lost his trademark snark. Tonight, he's playing solo. 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE CLIENTELE (Wednesday) This London indie-pop group fills out its sound on recent material, adding strings to its formula -- a mix of modern ironic poses with wistful nostalgia for classic rock 'n' roll and AM radio trifles. Annie Hayden opens. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $14. (Sinagra)    DONNA THE BUFFALO (Tomorrow) Donna the Buffalo is not named after its fiddler and singer, Tara Nevins. Its good-natured rock leans toward the Appalachian side of country music, though it also dips into reggae and Cajun music, with songs that ponder love and humanity's place in the universe. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    ECHO & THE BUNNYMEN (Sunday) Goth rock never goes out of style, but its current boost is good for the Echo and the Bunnymen frontman Ian McCulloch, one of the genre's first legitimate babes. The band has new songs but will appease black-clad fans with agitated favorites like ''The Cutter'' and ''The Killing Moon.'' Innaway opens. 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $22.50 in advance, $25 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)    ROBBIE FULKS, JON SPENCER (Tonight) The latest album by Chicago's country curveballer Robbie Fulks again prompts head shaking as to why this off-off-Opry wiseacre isn't a more famous songwriter (or at least a little bigger and richer). As alt-country fans know, he's a crackerjack guitarist and a charismatic performer to boot. The alt-punk bluesman Jon Spencer also plays, with his band Heavy Trash. 7:30, Housing Works Used Book Cafe, 126 Crosby Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3324; $25. (Sinagra)    GUSTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Guster, a band from Boston, has followed the Dave Matthews Band's playbook for building an audience: touring constantly and singing unabashedly earnest folk-rock songs about the painful uncertainties of friendship, love and growing up. 8, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171;$35. (Pareles)    H.I.M. (Tonight) This Finnish goth rock band's bid for Stateside success has been the pet cause of TV skate-rat Bam Margera. Now it finally gets a chance to show off its metallic riffs and the infernal majesty of the singer Ville Valo , who wears his ''heartagram'' (the band's romantically satanic heart and pentagram symbol) on his sleeve. Finch and Skindred also play. 6, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-7740; $28. (Sinagra)    IDA, MICHAEL HURLEY (Sunday) With their dreamy folk-pop, the trio Ida combine aching harmonies and a supple sense of play. They perform this free in-store show with one of their quirky antecedents, the folkie Michael Hurley. 7 p.m., Sound Fix Records, 110 Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-8090; free. (Sinagra)    RICKIE LEE JONES, VIC CHESNUTT (Tomorrow) Ms. Jones's Southwestern hippie roots give her urban-bohemian jazz leanings a trippy whimsy. You hope this outdoor set will cull from both the swooping multipartite reveries and the ersatz streetcorner jive of her 1970's releases, as well as the best of her songful later albums. Recent material by the Southern Gothic storyteller Vic Chesnutt leans to his darker side. 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 509-0300; free with ticket (details at www.musicdowntown.org). (Sinagra)    LCD SOUNDSYSTEM (Wednesday) With songs like ''Losing My Edge'' and ''Daft Punk Is Playing at My House,'' the Brooklyn producer and LCD leader James Murphy has proven himself a talented practitioner and master theorist of retro-chic sound, especially the current vogue for refashioning early 80's ''dance-punk.'' 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $20. (Sinagra)    AIMEE MANN, KEREN ANN (Sunday) Ms. Mann's recent concept album about two addicts in the 70's who meet at the Virginia fairgrounds features the astute, sad lyrics and low-key but enduring melodic hooks that this singer-songwriter is known for. The chanteuse Keren Ann applies her velvety voice to jazz-inflected, rainy day urban valentines. Her lolling tunes ponder love and travel, admitting that the strongest memory of a visited place is often the homesickness endured there. 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 509-0300; free with ticket (details at www.musicdowntown.org). (Sinagra)    RHETT MILLER (Tuesday and Wednesday) The leader of the once cocky and speedy, then honest and rootsy rock band the Old 97's, Rhett Miller is still writing near-genius tunes though he often leans on formal craft. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200; $20. (Tuesday sold out) (Sinagra)    SHARAM NAZERI (Sunday) Mr. Nazeri holds listeners rapt as he sings Kurdish songs, Persian classical music and Sufi songs based on the poems of Rumi; his voice can take on the humble clarity of Gregorian chant, or it can leap and swoop and ululate. 7 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536; $30 to $50. (Pareles)    NEW SOUNDS FROM POLAND (Tomorrow) This glimpse into new Polish music features sets by the accordion-based group the Motion Trio, and Lautari, an improvisatory ensemble inspired by folk traditions of Poland, Romania and Macedonia. 8 p.m., Peter Norton Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26. (Sinagra)    THE NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALLSTARS (Tonight) The Southern rock band North Mississippi All-Stars plays an asymmetrical, cantankerous blues from the hill country near where the members grew up, then turn it into jam-band music. 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles)    SAM CHAMPION (Tuesday) Local indie rock has been largely dominated by neo-formalist technicians as of late, making this quartet's looser approach, which harkens back to the slacker ennui epitomized by Pavement, a welcome addition. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)    RICHARD SHINDELL, LUCY KAPLANSKY (Tonight) In Richard Shindell's character studies, finely observed details suddenly add up to a larger picture that can be compassionate or troubling; he writes about a Civil War widow, an interrogator trying to turn a witness, a fugitive phoning his family. Lucy Kaplansky shares the bill. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $32 to $38 (sold out). (Pareles)    CARLY SIMON, BEN TAYLOR, SALLY TAYLOR (Tuesday) Carly Simon's hits like ''Anticipation'' and ''You're So Vain'' endure as evergreen go-girl inspirationals. She plays after opening sets by her children Ben and Sally Taylor. 8 p.m., Jazz at Lincoln Center, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Time Warner Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9800; $95 to $150. (Sinagra)    TRISTEZA (Tonight) This San Diego band plays instrumental music that augments rock with electronica. 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sinagra)    U2, PATTI SMITH (Monday and Tuesday) After 2000's thrilling ''All That You Can't Leave Behind'' (Interscope), U2's ''How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'' (Interscope) focuses on what humans can live without: namely, intercontinental ballistic missiles and third-world debt. The punk rock icon Patti Smith convenes her band to show young acolytes like the Fiery Furnaces how it's done in this year marking the 30th anniversary of her incendiary, poetic album ''Horses'' (Arista). 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741: $54 to $169.50. (Sinagra)    UMPHREY'S MCGEE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Umphrey's McGee has twin guitars and some jam-band roots, but its songs are more elaborate than the usual head-bobbing vamps; they're full of meter-shifting convolutions and jazzy twists that move close to progressive rock. 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $22.50, $25 at the door. (Pareles)    VODoU DRUMS AND DANCES OF HAITI (Tonight) The Afro-Haitian group La Troupe Makandal performs ritual drumming and chants in the vodou style.

(Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden)    * BILL CHARLAP AND SANDY STEWART (Tonight and tomorrow night) The profound, unadorned performances of standards by the jazz pianist Bill Charlap and his mother, the singer Sandy Stewart, are as deep as cabaret gets nowadays; not to be missed. 9 and 11:30, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $50 cover, with a $50 prix fixe dinner at the early shows and a $20 minimum at the late shows. (Holden)    ANNIE ROSS (Tomorrow) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 7 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum.

(Holden)    STEVE TYRELL (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Tyrell has one of those where-have-I-heard-it-before growls that sounds great on a movie soundtrack but loses its charm in a club as he rolls standards off the assembly line as if they were all the same song. 8:45, with additional shows at 10:45 tonight and tomorrow night, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $95 tonight and tomorrow; $85 Tuesday through Thursday.

ERIC ALEXANDER QUARTET WITH VON FREEMAN (Tuesday through Nov. 27) Mr. Alexander is one of the leading young inheritors of a muscular tenor saxophone style associated with the 1950's; the octogenarian Mr. Freeman, dropping in from his native Chicago, is one of the unsung but widely emulated heroes of that style. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212) 258-9595; $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.

(Chinen)    ROY AYERS BAND WITH BOBBI HUMPHREY (Through Sunday) Mr. Ayers, a vibraphonist, and Ms. Humphrey, a flutist, helped precipitate the 1970's boom in Afro-centric jazz-funk; that sound's refurbished cachet has made both artists newly relevant in recent years. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $32.50 to $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    MAURICE BROWN QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Brown, a young trumpeter recently displaced from the New Orleans scene, plays an extroverted strain of modern jazz that borrows from soul as well as bop; his partners here are Derek Douget on tenor saxophone, Jonathan Baptiste on piano, Peter Washington on bass and Billy Drummond on drums. 8 10, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    OSCAR NORIEGA TRIO (Tonight) Mr. Noriega, a clarinetist and saxophonist, taps into raw but focused energies in this group with the bassist Trevor Dunn and the drummer Tom Rainey; they're joined by the versatile singer Allyssa Lamb. 8, Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    GREG OSBY (Through Sunday) Tomorrow and Sunday, Mr. Osby's hard-charging trio with the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts will reprise material from ''Channel Three,'' a strong recent Blue Note album; tonight and tomorrow, Mr. Osby will lead his current quartet, with Cory Smythe on piano, Mr. Brewer on bass and Rodney Green on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen)    MARCUS ROBERTS TRIO (Through Sunday) Mr. Roberts has been an exemplar of blues-based jazz piano since his 1980's tenure with Wynton Marsalis; the bassist Roland Guerin and the drummer Jason Marsalis round out his excellent working trio. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212) 258-9595; $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.(Chinen)    * ROSWELL RUDD'S 70TH-BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Sunday) Mr. Rudd is a veteran trombonist who closely heeds an exploratory muse; on his new album, ''Blue Mongol'' (Sunnyside), he finds a common language with throat singers from Mongolia. But he celebrates his 70th birthday more traditionally, with a reunion of Eli's Chosen Six, a Dixieland group with which he played in the 1950's at Yale. 3 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000; $15. (Chinen)    * LUCIANA SOUZA QUARTET (Tonight) Ms. Souza, a Brazilian turned New Yorker, hones a personal and highly intelligent variety of jazz singing in this ensemble, with Adam Rogers on guitar, Scott Colley on bass and Nasheet Waits on drums. 9:30,, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)    RORY STUART QUARTET (Tomorrow) Mr. Stuart is a guitarist with a lithe and harmonically literate style; his ensemble features the smart, somewhat reclusive Mark Shim on tenor saxophone and the sterling rhythm team of Francois Moutin and Ari Hoenig on bass and drums. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $12 (students, $9), with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    * TOOTS THIELEMANS AND KENNY WERNER (Through Sunday) The Dutch harmonica master Toots Thielemans and the American pianist Kenny Werner have recorded fruitfully together in recent years; here they'll focus on Brazilian music, an area of specialty for Mr. Thielemans, in an all-star ensemble featuring the guitarist Oscar Castro-Neves and the percussionist Airto Moreira. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar and a one-drink $5 minimum.(Chinen)    WYNTON WITH STRINGS: 25TH YEAR CELEBRATION (Tonight and tomorrow night) Backed by his quartet and a string orchestra, the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis plays romantic jazz standards with a tender sort of effulgence. 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $130. (Chinen)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.         Opera    'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) She's back. After an initial flurry of less well-known Carmens at the Met this season, Denyce Graves is taking up one of her signature roles for a run of performances into December. And Marcello Giordani, with Don José, is coming into a role that should allow him to shine. Ana Maria Martinez, a young soprano with a burgeoning international career, makes her company debut as Micaëla. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $220 tickets remaining tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Wednesday. (Anne Midgette)    'THE LITTLE PRINCE' (Today, tomorrow and Sunday) Francesca Zambello's production, with bright, sure sets by Maria Bjornson, is gorgeous. And Rachel Portman's opera is opulent, with a veritably lush orchestra and a large children's chorus. All of this is an odd fit for the spareness of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's beloved book, which inspired it, but it makes for a colorful spectacle -- though it would lose nothing by being half an hour shorter. Tonight at 8, Saturday and Sunday afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $79 tonight, $25 to $65 tomorrow and $45 to $65 on Sunday. (Midgette)    'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Tomorrow) Jonathan Miller's spare, elegant production affords Mozart's music ample room to breathe. The solid cast includes Luca Pisaroni, Lisa Milne, Peter Mattei and Hei-Kyung Hong. Sandra Piques Eddy replaces Joyce DiDonato as Cherubino. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $220. (Jeremy Eichler)    'LA TRAVIATA' (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) The venerable Amato Opera may seat scarcely more than 100, but it can't be accused of cowardice. Its current run, now in its final weekend, is one of the hardest operas for soprano in the repertory, Verdi's ''Traviata.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; 65+, students and children, $25. (Midgette)    'TURANDOT' (Tomorrow) If your idea of a stimulating evening is watching a beefy and clearly none too intelligent prince devoting himself singlemindedly to winning the heart of a creepy harridan -- and, O.K., singing ''Nessun Dorma'' along the way -- the company's venerable Beni Montresor staging (now directed by Beth Greenberg) is back on the boards. Its strong cast includes Lori Phillips in the title role, Philip Webb as Calaf and Guylaine Girard as Liù. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $120. (Allan Kozinn)    Classical Music    AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Witold Lutoslawski's orchestral works have slipped into the standard repertory to a great extent, but programs focusing on his music exclusively are rare. Leon Botstein has assembled a great overview, from the classic ''Musique Funèbre'' (1958) to the increasingly popular violin concerto ''Chain 2'' (1985). Included as well as are two symphonies, the First (1947) and the Third (1983). 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $53. (Kozinn)    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Vladimir Stoupel, a pianist, is holding forth this week, alone and with friends, at this intimate chamber hall on a converted coffee barge. Tonight, Mr. Stoupel plays a program of five Scriabin sonatas (Nos. 2, 3, 8, 9 and 10). He spends the rest of the weekend playing works by Schubert, Bach, Schumann and Joan Tower with Judith Ingolfsson, the violinist, and on Thursday, he is joined by Mark Peskanov, the violinist, and Peter Bruns, the cellist, for a program of Haydn and Brahms. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m.; Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35; $25 for students. (Kozinn)    JENNIFER CHECK (Tuesday) She does small roles at the Met but has a big voice to watch. This young soprano, an alumna of the Met's Lindemann program and already presented in New York by the Marilyn Horne Foundation, won first place in the Young Concert Artists auditions this year, and as a result is giving her Carnegie recital debut with a program of Purcell, Richard Strauss, Schumann and others. Laura Ward is the piano accompanist. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 and $35. (Midgette)    CHOIR OF ST. IGNATIUS LOYOLA AND PIFFARO (Tonight) Kent Tritle leads his superb choir, with accompaniment from Piffaro, a fine period-instrument band, in music of the German Baroque.

Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue, at 84th Street, (212) 288-2520; $25 to $45. (Kozinn)    EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Tomorrow and Sunday) Arguing that although public church performances of the time were sung by men, women sang sacred music in convents and secular music at court, this venerable ensemble has taken to presenting an annual concert sung and played by women. This year's installment is an overview of sacred and secular works by the Franco-Flemish masters of the 15th and 16th centuries, among them Dufay, Binchois, Ockeghem, Obrecht and Josquin. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330; $40. (Kozinn)    JUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) In the spirit of its idiosyncratic founder, Jens Nygaard, this feisty ensemble offers programs that combine oddities and either familiar works or lesser-known scores by well-known composers. This week the focus is on virtuoso playing and includes music by Boccherini, Paganini, Respighi, Verdi, Rossini and Gambaro. 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 799-1259; $10 to $25. (Kozinn)    NEW JUILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Tuesday) This student group, led by Joel Sachs, plays difficult music in virtually every contemporary style, and usually does it with assurance and polish.

(Bernard Holland)    PAULA ROBISON (Tomorrow) This excellent flutist and her audiences never seem to tire of music by Vivaldi, and she is sure to play it here with her usual flair. But it would also be good, for a change, to find out what else is on her musical mind. 7 p.m., Temple of Dendur, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $60. (James R. Oestreich)    ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight and tomorrow night) The highly touted David Robertson makes his first New York appearance as music director of the orchestra, tonight centering on music of Debussy (and paintings of Monet) and tomorrow presenting works by Mozart, Mahler and Morton Feldman. 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; tonight, $10 to $35; tomorrow, $23 to $79.(Oestreich)    ANTTI SIIRALA (Tonight) Antti Siirala, a busy and successful veteran of the piano competition wars in Britain, brings four Beethoven piano sonatas, including ''Les Adieux'' and the delectable little F sharp major Sonata. 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $40.

(Anderson)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    Asia society: 'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)    Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)    * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are now on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show will figure on any short list of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Grace Glueck)    * JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)    * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * MET: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT,' through Dec. 31. Hands down, the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, séance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. Its subjects include the depths of human gullibility and the conjuring power of photography, whose technology, we may forget in the cynical day of digital manipulation and Photoshop, seemed unfathomable to so many people a century and more ago. The exhibition's deeper subject is the dreamer in all of us. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    * Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well-known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    * Museum of Modern Art: Beyond the Visible: 'The Art of Odilon Redon,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-siècle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)    * Museum of Modern Art : 'ELIZABETH MURRAY,'  through Jan. 9. Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    neue galerie: 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits and drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson)    * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through Jan. 16. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demi-monde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still-lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084.(Cotter)    * P.S. 1: 'The Painted World,' through Jan. 30. Though this 23-artist exhibition of mostly contemporary abstractionists lacks bite as a whole, every individual painter in it is worthy of attention. In addition to ancestral figures like Myron Stout and Moira Dryer, the show includes Philip Taaffe, Mary Heilmann and Chris Martin. (See above.) (Johnson)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was one of the major American artists of the early 20th century. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Glueck)    * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years, Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above) (Kimmelman)    Galleries: 57th Street    EDWARD MAYER: 'DRAWING OUT' A single work designed for and occupying the entire front exhibition space of this gallery, ''Drawing Out'' looks both sturdy and fragile, a skeletal open-work modular passageway 18-feet-long, put together as if from a giant Erector set. At once disciplined architecture and intuitive sculptural drawing, the piece invites you to enter and explore it, while conveying a disturbing sense of matter out of place. How often do you get to view a drawing from the inside out? Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street (212) 752-1223, through Dec. 3. (Glueck)    TOM WESSELMANN: 'WORKS ON PAPER, RETROSPECTIVE'  Typed as a Pop artist early on for his portrayals of commercial foodstuffs as well as of stylized women's bodies (or parts thereof) that mingled classic odalisque and sexy pinup, Tom Wesselmann (1931-2004) had other strings to his bow, among them an interest in landscape and, later in his career, large abstract cutouts in metal. His provocative nude icons are here in abundance, but also evident is his interest in Matisse, Picasso and Mondrian. This lively show of 44 works on paper, arranged by his daughter, Kate, also reveals that Wesselmann was a compulsive draftsman, producing and revising many color and compositional studies for his finished works. Maxwell Davidson Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 759-7555, through Dec. 23. (Glueck)    Galleries: Chelsea    Mona Hatoum: 'Mobile Home' The playful side of this often politically motivated sculptor prevails. The centerpiece, ''Mobile Home,'' is an arrangement of domestic objects strung on fine cables between metal traffic barriers; it takes a moment to realize that the toys, chairs, suitcases and other items are slowly rolling back and forth on tiny wheels. An installation upstairs consists of a circle of slowly pulsing light bulbs plugged into intricately interwoven cables. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 367-7474, through Dec. 22. (Johnson)    James Hayward A veteran Los Angeles-based abstract painter selected for this show by Mike Kelley, Mr. Hayward presents a recent series of single-color paintings made of extremely thick, crisscrossing brush strokes. The optical and tactile combine to exceptionally satisfying effect. Cue, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 206-3583, through Dec. 3. (Johnson)    Mel Leipzig A Trenton-based realist who began exhibiting in the mid-1960's, Mr. Leipzig paints affectionate, exhaustively detailed portraits of people in their homes or workplaces with a deliberately unpolished touch. One subject is a man with a shaved head and a goatee relaxing on his living room sofa in the midst of an amazingly extensive collection of sports memorabilia. Henoch, 555 West 25th Street, (917) 305-0003, through Dec. 3. (Johnson)    * Ann Lislegaard: 'Bellona (after Samuel R. Delany)' An entrancing animated video based on a famous science-fiction novel tours a mazelike series of empty rooms. Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372, through Dec. 3. (Johnson)    Kim Simonsson Under the influence of Japanese manga cartoons, this Finnish ceramicist makes large, monochromatic sculptures of wide-eyed, otherworldly girls and deer. Nancy Margolis, 523 West 25th Street, (212) 242-3013, through Nov. 26. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    Hans Hofmann: 'The Legacy' Hofmann was one of the few who made it into the art history hall of fame as both teacher and painter. Along with three works by the master himself, this exhibition presents abstract and semi-abstract paintings by disciples who were either directly taught or deeply influenced by him, including Ludwig Sander, Robert De Niro, Louisa Matthiasdottir and Laurie Fendrich. The Painting Center, 52 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 343-1060, through Dec. 24. (Johnson)    * 'If It's Too Bad to Be True, It Could Be Disinformation' Old-style political art said yes or no, told you what to do. New-style political art, as often as not, obscures its intentions, makes you wonder what it's up to and goes for confusion, as in this shrewd, dematerialized group exhibition on the subject of disinformation, a passive form of political deceit that tells lies through the omission of facts. The idea is that the less people know about what their government is doing, the less likely they are to raise a fuss. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, through Nov. 26. (Cotter)    * André KertEsz From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson)    Ray Mortenson: 'Cedars/Sea and Sky' Alternating between the land and sea of Rhode Island, this quietly gripping show of mostly small black-and-white photographs presents soft and misty images of bushy cedars and extraordinarily clear and luminous pictures of ocean waves. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 431-0166, through Dec. 4. (Johnson)    * 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AT THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY' Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069, through Feb. 12. (Smith)    'System in Chaos: New Art Brut From the Czech Republic' Four fascinating Czech outsiders: Zdenek Kosek's small, congested bubble diagrams chart unfathomable verbal associations; Lubos Plny's expansive, finely detailed drawings offer delirious lessons in human anatomy; Zbynek Semerak's small, delicately busy works on paper convey what seems to be a medieval iconography of religion and architecture; and Leos Wertheimer's large drawings portray locomotives with mechanical precision. Cavin-Morris, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3768, through Nov. 26. (Johnson)    Robert Therrien, 'Table and Six Chairs' In a vast corporate atrium stand a table and six chairs that are wholly ordinary-looking except for their gigantic size -- the chair backs rise to almost nine feet, and the top of the table is over six feet. Mr. Therrien transformed his own kitchen furniture into painted metal monuments that make the viewer feel like the protagonist of ''Jack and the Beanstalk.'' The Atrium of 590 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 980-4575, through Nov. 28. (Johnson)    Last Chance    'Eighth Annual International Juried Botanical Art Exhibition' The old-fashioned art of botanical illustration lives on, as evinced by this selection of finely made drawings and watercolors by more than 40 artists. Many are routinely competent, but some, like a small, intense picture of a gnarly root ball by Jean Emmons, are remarkable for both what and how they represent. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, closing tomorrow . (Johnson)    'Landscape: Myth and Memory' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux-antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, closing on Wednesday. (Johnson)    'PLAIN OF HEAVEN' Organized by Creative Time, this show of mostly site-specific installations insinuates a reverberating, poetic Minimalism into the darkened spaces of a former meatpacking plant. The efforts of Corey McCorkle, O. Winston Link, Leandro Erlich, Helen Mirra, Gordon Matta-Clark, William Forsythe and Saskia Olde-Wolbers are noteworthy. A sound piece by Trisha Donnelly will engulf the building for the last 20 minutes of the show's run. 832 Washington Street, at Gansevoort Street, West Village, (212) 206-6674, closing on Sunday.

The bottle is believed to have been a perfume sprinkler intended for the Oriental market.   Next the literal sense. In 1972 flood waters caused by Hurricane Agnes caused $750 million in property damage to counties along the Southern Tier of New York State. The glass museum suffered considerable losses.

Mr. Grove took dead aim at the lack of efficiency in health care -- the amount of time it takes a research lab to turn an idea into a working drug, for instance; and the extent to which medicine lags behind other industries in using technology to store and retrieve data, to the detriment of doctors and patients.

So a Broadway version to which all the nonsense has been added raises a few questions. For whom is this show really intended? Can its live action rival the film's flawless animation? How will it play for children, who were after all the audience that made \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" a hit? And what if those children only have milk money, not the $65 needed for a seat in the orchestra?   Bear in mind that a family outing for four can cost $260 -- maybe more, if you don't make it past the $45 sweatshirts and $20 audiocassettes at the souvenir stand. Can this experience possibly be worth 13 times as much as a \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" videotape, which also happens to be the more enduring purchase? Believe me, even a 5-year-old can do the arithmetic on that one, especially a 5-year-old who loves the film.

LONG ISLAND GUIDE"},{"year":"1943","title":"The internationalistic World Theatre, which \\"went Mexican\\" most recently, apparently can't get over its love for French films, even though there are very few unshown ones left. So it has dug up an old French-language version of \\"The Last Will of Dr. Mabuse,\\" which was made eight or nine years ago by Fritz Lang shortly after he had made a German version of same, and is showing it now for the first time in this country. (The German version was seen here several years ago.)It is a weird and morbid crime film, in Mr. Lang's vivid early style, which tells how a smart police inspector (in Berlin, apparently) rounds up a ring of master criminals who take their orders from a mad psychiatrist, who, in turn, gets his plots for depredations from a criminal lunatic. Mr. Lang has recently written that he made the film as an allegory to show the German people the vicious methods of their new leaders, Hitler and his gang. Maybe. That sounds like after-reckoning. But, at least, this film is in the vein of brutish paranoia which afflicted the Germans at the time, and for that it has significance and interest. Otherwise it is a good, old film, well played and beautifully directed—but a battered antique, none the less. Simple and clear English titles clarify the strange things that go on.

The producers of this audacious film also take great delight in poking fun at a prohibitionist, who, one may be right in thinking, will never dare face his blue-ribbon party members again, for he is one of very few persons who becomes more than slightly intoxicated.This German dry, a pompous individual named Livius Heintze, is unconsciously humorous, although decorous in his conduct at the outset of this farcical yarn. In the course of the proceedings he becomes less and less dignified, until at the close he is beheld plunging into a tank of water on a small stage and then pulling in a woman performer after him.Herr Heintze is actually in Berlin to attend the prohibition convention, but he is led off to the brewers' convention by an old flame. This picture, which evidently espouses the wets, reveals that the only persons who are drunk are a few drys, who attend the wet convention on the pretext that they wish to gather data for their talks on prohibition.Although there are a few reprehensible flashes in this offering, it is produced cleverly, with excellent scenes of a cheery throng of young and old blowing froth from their mugs of beer. To add further interest to the proceedings, several songs are sung from a stage for the benefit of the audience of drinkers.Carl Boese, the director, has succeeded in obtaining excellent performances from his large cast. Ludwig Stoessel is capital as the prohibitionist leader who falls from grace. Margarete Kupfer does well as his wife. Hans Adalbert von Schlettow is splendid as a congenial brewer appropriately named Seidl, who falls in love with Heintze's pretty daughter.

Written and directed by Zbynek Bynych, who becomes with this movie quite simply one of the best directors we have, the film is about courage and honor. Very much in the old style: physical courage, moral honor — the sacrifice of one life for another and in the name of that historical optimism that is at the heart of faith and morality.In a way, the film is about a house—a house full of tenants in Prague, in the face of the Nazi apocalypse. The tenants are a Jewish doctor (Miroslav Machacek), forbidden by the Nazis to practice but asked by another tenant (Ilja Prachar) to perform an operation and find morphine for a wounded member of the underground","excerpt":"a bespectacled informer (Josep Vinklar); a rich lawyer (Jiri Adamira), who is tempted to inform, and his wife (Zdenka Prochazkova), who ultimately wants him to; their son; an old music teacher (Olga Scheinpflugova) going mad; an eccentric (Alexandra Myskova) already mad; a baby, a dachshund, some rabbits, Prachar's wife, Adamira's maid. All these, Jiri Vrstala, as a police inspector, and several other characters in minor parts are absolutely right and natural. The search for morphine virtually defines their times.The movie opens with shots of violins, and clocks and pianos being tuned — in a warehouse for confiscated Jewish property. There are also shots of Prague, of cobbles, and streetcar wires, church ceilings, peeling walls, crowds, houses and stairs, crisscrossing traffic, alleys, arches, posters, light-bulbs against the light. There are scenes of the Desparation Bar, a beautifully crowded wild nightclub for the doomed. The Jewish doctor approaches a van, on whose panel one reads \\"er.\\" The camera moves left: \\"berger,\\" \\"chenberger,\\" \\"Kirchenberger\\"; a plainclothesman is leaning against it. The doctor runs in fear.When his courage is tested, though, he is not presented as one of those shambling, sentimental stereotypes common in stories of this kind. He looks forward to doing surgery again. He is proud. He regards his life as ended anyway. He is glad to do his bit for a cause: And, of course, he is appalled and afraid. There are moments of great suspense about what will happen to him, and to his patient, as the degrees of fear represented by the other tenants of the house come into play. There is the informer, even the dachshund drawn to a spot of blood in the hall. Everything, every sound is a threat.But what is most impressive about the movie is certain ironic and moving events. The boy, seeing a man fall off his bicycle to the cobbled street, laughs. Seeing him fall a second time, he laughs again. The third time a look of horror comes over his face. In a forced brothel for soldiers where the doctor's sister works, there is a long scene of naked women under the shower heads, with baroque music playing and a sense of imminence of death. There is a Jewish insane asylum, with a kind of ballet and symphony of the voices of the mad. (The use of music and sound generally in this film is very effective and delicate.) Finally, there is a scene in which all the tenants but one file past a corpse, as the Fascist radio blares. Characterization throughout the film has been so sharp that the behavior of each one as he walks by seems exactly true. And the message of the film—although it is by no means a work of propaganda—seems so well taken and inspiring that it is odd it should work at all in these neurotically skeptical, morally inert times.The movie was shown last summer at the Festival of New Czechoslovak Cinema at Lincoln Center.

Not only has it been made, confessedly, twice before by Paramount, but in the meantime it has been unofficially pirated, at least once, by nearly every hard-put producer in Hollywood. Though its title is somewhat more equivocal than usual, it still deals with the complicating influence of a babe upon the moral lives of a professional gambler and his stage-struck wife, and one of its principal dramatic devices is still the scent of heliotrope.Herbert Marshall is the gentleman known as Heliotrope Harry—gambling club proprietor who superstitiously regards the odor, and the flower itself, as a symbol and necessary concomitant of his luck. Harry has a wife (Gertrude Michael) who cheats, and withal so unprettily, with such a wealth of unrefined detail that she emerges as one of the most convincing portraits in the cinema's lamentably under-stocked gallery of female villainy","excerpt":"a Bette Davis of the program picture. Mr. Marshall gives one of his usual ingratiating, almost overly polished and somehow spinally weak characterizations. A thoughtful and sincere performer, he nevertheless does not impress you as being sufficiently involved emotionally to shoot his wife's lover the way he does, though we might have foreseen that he would make a model prisoner when sent up to the penitentiary for life.Things rock along peaceably in the prison workshop for years until the babe grows up and becomes the marriageable Jane Rhodes (having been adopted in infancy and reared by a wealthy couple), and Mama—now a burlesque queen—bethinks herself of blackmail. Then only does the unmutinous Marshall chafe at the confining walls, and, with the aid of a police sergeant friend, agitate for and obtain his parole, in order to protect Jane's happiness. How he breaks his wife's morale by a subtle barrage of heliotrope-scented sachet bags and corsages and—having promised the warden not to lay a revengeful finger upon her—prevents her from wrecking his daughter's life by sacrificing his own makes a passable though, alas! more than thrice-told tale.

Among the few who had warned of such sluggishness in the economy were advisers to Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic candidate for President. Their predictions had been dismissed as overly grim by the Reagan Administration. \\n\\nBolstering fears that the economy was heading toward negative growth was the report that new orders for durable goods fell 4.1 percent in October, after a 3.8 percent drop in September.

The most widely accepted theory is that passage must have occurred in blood-to-blood contact, like a bite or cut during the slaughter of chimpanzees.    Now Edward Hooper, a British journalist, has provided new evidence, gathered in interviews and library research since 1990, for an old theory that AIDS was inadvertently brought on by humans in the early testing of a polio vaccine in Africa in the 1950's. Mr. Hooper found close coincidence in both time and place between the earliest cases of AIDS and the testing of a polio vaccine. All the evidence is circumstantial.

But I made big mistake. I left her because one of the agencies offered me a better paying job. Two years later, she died and her personal chauffeur and cook each got $200,000 and the housekeepers got $50,000. There was a big payoff for everyone.

Mr. Steiner, the Treasury Department's chief of staff, testified before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, shed no light on anything, and promptly disappeared into the dregs of a news cycle dominated by the marathon bad hair day of the designated Whitewater fall guy, Roger Altman.
