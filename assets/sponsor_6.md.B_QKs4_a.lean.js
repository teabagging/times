But surely one reason was that for all its Babylonian stage apparatus, for all its formulaic struggles between thwarted lovers and rulers and climbing aspirants, for all the dutiful invocations of matricide and regicide, the opera is almost completely about the human voice. The plot merely provides the occasions for display of the voice's own apparatus, struggles and passions.   So why, then, was the cast for the Metropolitan Opera's first performance of \\"Semiramide\\" this season, on Monday night, devoid of any well-known stars or vocal virtuosos?

Major cities: Dili (capital). PEOPLE Population: 997,853 (2003 est.). Nationality: noun—Timorese","excerpt":"adjective—Timorese.

Early in the sixteenth century, Portuguese traders settled on some of the islands of the Malayan Archipelago, including Timor, and established trading posts there. In 1613 rival traders from the Netherlands settled in western Timor and began the slow process of pushing the Portuguese eastward. (The actual boundary on Timor was no settled by treaty until 1859.) As Dutch, and then British, power waxed through the 17th century, that of Portugal waned, leaving but a handful of fragments, like Goa and Macao and East Timor, of the Portuguese eastern sea empire. But unlike the Dutch or English, the Portuguese sought to maintain close bonds among economic, political, and religious expansion. A missionary effort made East Timor something of a Catholic enclave amidst the predominantly Muslim Dutch East Indies (and, after 1949, Indonesia). Still, as late as 1975 only about one-third were Catholic; it was the independence struggle that brought the Catholic presence to its current 90 percent. The leftist coup in Portugal in April 1974, with its socialist, democratic, but above all anti-imperialist ideology, led to the abandonment of East Timor; in Dec. 1975 Indonesia began its brutal conquest and annexation which led to an enduring guerilla warfare and eventually independence. The 1998 fall of Indonesia's dictator Suharto gave space for the 1999 U.N.-sponsored referendum on independence: 78 percent voted “yes.” While Muslim militias, aided by segments of the Indonesian armed forces, ravaged the country, a U.N. trusteeship, run principally by Australia and Portugal, readied the new state for independence, finally celebrated May 20, 2002 under its first president, resistance leader Jose Gusmao.

Now, even with fixed-rate mortgages at their lowest rates in years -- an average of 9.41 percent -- adjustable mortgages, with initial rates averaging about 7.43 percent, are still cheaper. The rate on a variable-interest mortgage rises and falls with a particular financial index. Each lender selects its index based on an analysis of what best protects its own loan portfolio. Almost half of all adjustable-rate mortgages are tied to Treasury securities that are traded daily and mature in one year. In shopping for a mortgage, be aware that other choices are available, like two-step mortgages, which let the lender reset the rate once. Here are the more commonly used indexes, which borrowers may use as a guide in estimating how their present adjustable mortgages may change, or in seeking the best deal:         Index   Current   Rate       Rate   A Year Ago       One-year Treasury              (estimated return)   6.41%   8.35%              11th District cost of funds (aver       age yield paid on all savings by       California savings institutions)   7.85   8.36              National cost of funds (average       yield paid on all savings by sav       ings institutions nationwide)   6.54   7.92         Source: Federal National Mortgage Association and Bank Rate Monitor   Guidepost","excerpt":"Adjustable Is Attractive"},{"year":"1946","title":"sets ceilings for men's new surplus wool ski socks OPA ACTS TO SPEED HOUSING PROGRAM","excerpt":"Adjustable Pricing Permitted on Stock Mill Work, Screen Goods Pending New Ceilings COSTS STUDY UNDER WAY Reviewing Data Submitted by Advisory Group, Industry --Other Agency Action"},{"year":"1932","title":"Feature article Model School at the World's Fair To Present Novel Aids for Teaching","excerpt":"Adjustable Rooms to Accommodate Classes of Any Desired Size to Be an Outstanding Feature of the Building -- Plans Embody the Suggestions of Twenty-nine Leading School Architects."},{"year":"1953","title":"J Heim and P Gordon offer new brassier top, Biarritz Bra NEW BLOUSE-TYPE BRA","excerpt":"Adjustable Straps Used to Fit Big and Small Figures"},{"year":"2006","title":"Credit counselors are reporting that mortgage debt is increasingly significant factor in poor financial health of consumers contemplating bankruptcy","excerpt":"adjustable-rate mortgages are leaving many borrowers vulnerable to sharply higher monthly payments (M) A Growing Burden of Home Debt"},{"year":"1992","title":"Adjustable-rate mortgage funds were created a few years ago as a lower-risk version of Ginnie Mae funds, for which refinancings can cause high-rate mortgages to be replaced with lower-rate ones.

Share prices of the adjustable-rate mortgage funds have been less volatile than Ginnie Mae share prices, just as fund sponsors promised. But there is a trade-off.

effect of such change would have made more aid available for S Vietnam, and would have freed entire 30% in restricted category for other neediest nations to which Sec Kissinger has pledged help; US Sen Hubert Humphrey, author of 30% amendment to foreign aid bill, says Vietnam will not be classified as ‘a most seriously effected nation’ and will thus remain in political category; Kissinger, who has pledged to give more than $500‐million in food aid to S Vietnam, S Korea and Chile even though they are not classified among neediest nations, reptdly is arguing that Humphrey amendment applies to all areas of Public Law 480, which is divided into large concessional sales program and smaller grant aid program;
