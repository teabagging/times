Rather, the jury generally decides that the chosen artist is someone whose work it would like to see more of, whose entry suggests a range, a possible breadth that cannot be expressed in a single example - in short, someone capable of mounting a respectable professional show.   Such a decision is difficult indeed for a jury that may be unfamiliar with many of the artists in question.

Pared to essentials and polished to a high-grade show business gloss, \\"And the World Goes 'Round\\" opened almost two years later in New York City. The reviews were terrific. Awards followed and the show ran almost a year","excerpt":"surprisingly, no longer. More surprisingly, its investment was not recouped.    With scenic and technical embellishments added and the first article of the title dropped, \\"The World Goes 'Round\\" gave the premiere performance of a 10-month national tour at the Westport Country Playhouse on Tuesday. The joyful news is that, here and now, the show is at its sparkling best. And maybe this time, given an expanded design for Broadway-size theaters and an augmented orchestra, the producers will have a hit, commercial as well as artistic.    This would be only fair, for the revue has evolved from a contrived concept piece to an ideal showcase for the John Kander (music) and Fred Ebb (lyrics) mostly upbeat, mostly unfamiliar songs from mostly unacknowledged musicals: \\"70, Girls, 70,\\" \\"The Happy Time,\\" \\"The Rink,\\" \\"The Act,\\" \\"Kiss of the Spider Woman\\" (still in progress) and \\"Flora, the Red Menace\\" (their first collaboration).    And unlike its pre-New York exposure, the selections here are being interpreted more distinctively and arranged more inventively, with a greater emphasis on detail that downplays associations to the most celebrated delineator of Kander and Ebb material: Liza Minnelli, a connection originally perpetuated to the detriment of the collaborators and the performers.    Now, witness an ingenious arrangement of \\"Cabaret,\\" with scatting and five-part harmony, affectingly introduced by Joel Blum -- by a    man   , it must be reinforced -- and a delightful multilingual version of \\"New York, New York.\\"   The cast consists of enormously accomplished singers and dancers: Mr. Blum and Marin Mazzie (who were replacements in the New York production), John Ruess and Shelley Dickinson. It is to the considerable credit of Scott Ellis's spiffy and terrifically paced staging that it evokes an infectious spirit of ensemble and allows each performer the chance to make an individual impact.    And then there is Karen Ziemba. It is to no one's discredit that Ms. Ziemba is a singular sensation; even ensembles are entitled to their stars. Note the name, if you are acquaintance with the musical theater's shining new stars is not up to the minute. The only remaining member of the show's original cast, Ms. Ziemba, aglow after her recent triumph in the New York City Opera's new production of \\"110 in the Shade\\" has a pliable, radiant capacity to be frazzled, cool, comedic and casually sexy. Indeed, Ms. Ziemba's very presence can be so smoldering that it seems redundant to frame her entrance for \\"All That Jazz\\" with smoke.    Mr. Blum is lithe, wistful, funny and ardent. Observe his tender, loving paean to Sara Lee pastries, and his endearing self-effacement and masterly hoofing in \\"Mr. Cellophane,\\" a hymn to a nonentity.    Mr. Ruess has an all-purpose voice that can float a pianissimo or resound with full-bodied rich tones. Ms. Mazzie and Ms. Dickinson alternate between the torchy and the zany with attractive ease.    The choreography of Susan Stroman, which embraces an extensive dance vocabulary, from boogie-woogie to balletic, enhances and supports the songs without calling attention to itself. That's when it is very subtle, but when it is showy, it is absolutely smashingly showy, pulling out banjos, crutches or skates, and capping the production with a sweeping pas de deux for Ms. Ziemba and Mr. Blum, in a wordless suite from \\"Cabaret.\\"    In a funny number, the cast gives a pleasurable demonstration of the sheer pain of dancing. At every turn, Ms. Stroman puts a fresh spin on traditional musical comedy dancing.    Most impressively, Mr. Ellis and Ms. Stroman, who were the show's director and choreographer since its inception, have so refined their work that it honors the essence of the Kander-Ebb oeuvre in the purist way. A recurring reprise of a phrase or two from the title number, to give it continuity. Even lesser moments -- \\"Coffee in a Cardboard Cup,\\" \\"Arthur in the Afternoon,\\" \\"Sara Lee\\" -- are stylishly done, without the musial comedy cutesiness that once afflicted them.   Finally, near its end, one can proclaim the summer's best musical production, and a first-class show for Westport's season. And now theatergoers can get a jump on those in Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Ohio, California, Texas -- and all stops on what should be a triumphal tour.       \\"The World Goes 'Round\\" at the Westport Country Playhouse, 25 Powers Court, just off the Post Road East (Route 1).

The New York premiere of this image-rich piece, distantly inspired by a book James Joyce never wrote, opened the Merce Cunningham Dance Company's two-week season on Tuesday night at the City Center (131 West 55th Street).   Mr. Cunningham's works are sometimes perceived as hermetic, removed from reality. The paradox is that he and John Cage, his musical adviser, have long insisted that art can incorporate the sights, sounds and processes found in the real world. Thus, \\"43, \\" the Cage score that prompted the creation of \\"Beach Birds,\\" is full of silence, and Mr. Cunningham's choreography is full of stillness. Review/Dance","excerpt":"Surreal Beach Life Amid the Silences of Unreality"},{"year":"1993","title":"The battle of the sexes in Elizabeth Egloff's absurdist play \\"The Swan\\" is more than a failure of communication or even a biologically determined hormonal clash. As Dora (Frances McDormand), a part-time nurse who lives alone on the edge of a Nebraska highway imagines it, men are born on the planet Pluto, molecularly disassembled and sent directly to Earth by radar. Their troubles arise from having to adapt to an alien ecosystem. An inability to adapt was the reason, she believes, why one of her three former husbands shot himself to death the day after they were married.    A dark comedy of the supernatural tinged with Greek myth, \\"The Swan,\\" which opened yesterday at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, is an absorbing 100-minute riff on Dora's theory. Most of all, the play, which suggests a softer, surreal response to Sam Shepard's \\"Fool for Love,\\" is notable for a tumultuously intense performance by the Swedish actor Peter Stormare. As a man who literally falls to earth and into Dora's life, the actor, who made such a memorable Hamlet in Ingmar Bergman's touring production, gives a wrenching evocation of primal man as a lonely, wounded creature in dire need of nurturing.

A quarter-century later, Surrealism, the movement that Breton helped to found in France in the early 1920's and over which he regally presided, is suddenly everywhere being celebrated and revalued.    It was not long ago that Surrealism was widely dismissed. Modernists had little use for the movement's anti-formalism, for its concerns with things like disorder, excess and exotica. The antics of Salvador Dali, the movement's most famous practitioner and publicity hound, only solidified a perception of Surrealism as trivial and gimmicky. These qualities were accentuated by countless advertising campaigns and other mass-market appropriations of the movement.

The virginal heroine Helena is helplessly in love with a count who radiates callowness and inattention. To secure his love, she must resort to a deceit that stretches credibility to the breaking point. Nevertheless, the play has a mature wit, and Shakespeare has made Helena into one of his noblest creations, a feminist far before her time.   At the Hartford Stage, Mark Lamos has wisely looked beneath the play's surface and located a fairy tale, in which a sleeping prince, or in this case a count, is led to discover a woman's inner beauty.

The slickness and buffoonery of Salvador Dali, the most popular Surrealist, has encouraged the belief that Surrealism was mainly about posturing and surprise. When Surrealism has influenced recent art, it has been largely as a style, or as an esthetic, of metamorphosis, incongruity and deformation.   The great strength of \\"Anxious Visions: Surrealist Art,\\" at the University Art Museum in Berkeley, Calif., through Dec. 30, is that it restores to Surrealism something of the edge that made it the most influential avant-garde movement between the two world wars. Sidra Stich, the chief curator at the museum, has largely stayed away from literature, tribal art, psychoanalysis and dream, the contexts in which Surrealism has usually been understood. This is the first exhibition that has attempted to root it in the social and political crises of its time.

Johnson surrogate-mother case (news article, Oct. 23), rejecting the notion of three legal parents, is a reminder of how the law often reacts when faced with legal problems arising from new scientific technology.   As you report, Judge Parslow seemed most concerned about the possibility of extortion by the surrogate if she were permitted to acquire parental rights at birth. Wouldn't it be sensible to consider extortion or attempted extortion by a surrogate ground for denying custody or even termination of parental rights? What about exploitation of surrogates?   There are sound reasons why our common and statutory law universally prohibits legally binding termination of future parental rights of a pregnant woman before the child is born. To say that the nongenetic gestational mother can never have future parental rights is an open invitation to exploitation of poor women as baby factories.   For Judge Parslow to say his decision is not giving effect to baby selling doesn't make it so. To say that bearing a child from implantation of an eight-cell embryo to a term newborn infant is foster care is absurd (and incidentally lends support to an overruled Tennessee trial court decision that a pre-embryo is a child!).    A child that results from genetic material of a man and a woman, and gestation in a different woman, has three biological parents. Indeed, the biological relationship between a mother-to-be and a fetus is profound, and one can drastically alter the existence of the other, even if none of the fetal genes are derived from the mother-to-be.   The child born with three biological parents, regardless of whether two or three of them are legal parents of the child, two of whom may be living together as a married couple separate from the other, is no more split emotionally than a child of parents who have been divorced and remarried, who is the subject of a joint or shared custody agreement.   Using genetic origins exclusively to determine legal relationships is unwise policy and is going to create many more legal problems than it will ever solve. BRUCE L.

So through this stormy winter, I've been turning, now and then, to where Americans beyond the urban culture meccas get a regular taste of real-time musicianship: the talk shows. Each has a nightly musical guest, grabbing five minutes of network glory, plugging a hit or hoping to revive a falling album. But guest musicians come and go: the hippest on David Letterman's \\"Late Show\\" (with \\"The Arsenio Hall Show\\" outdoing all competition in the realm of hip-hop) and the most unpredictable on Conan O'Brien's \\"Late Night,\\" which books groups that are still playing clubs.    Yet when viewed on any regular basis, nightly television's real musical offerings are the house bands. Alongside each genial, shtick-happy host is a combo that greases transitions, introduces chatting celebrities, backs up guest singers (on the rare occasions when they don't bring their own groups), entertains the studio audience during breaks and provides rimshots at punchlines.
