The south face of Everest, a diabolical crossword, the later Henry James -- their allure underscores a very human paradox, that the gratification won through struggle is doubly sweet. This truth has a special resonance in the world of drink, where virtually    all    tastes are acquired. No one is born with the hankering for a dry martini, shaken not stirred. It's only by experimenting, waging war on prejudice and bending the taste buds that we colonize exotic flavors.   Why bother? Curiosity, for one thing. The powerful imperatives of connoisseurship, for another, given extra oomph by the knowledge that forbidding terrain can be cultivated and made to yield fruit. We yearn to refine what the English essayist Joseph Addison called \\"that sensitive taste which gives us a relish of every different flavor that affects the palate.\\" Snobbery has something to do with it as well: The host who brings out an obscure single-malt whisky from the isle of Jura trumps his Glenfiddich-drinking guests, who in turn regard Johnnie Walker drinkers with disdain. And don't discount the fugitive impulse to run off and worship strange gods.

You do a serious injustice to the Panama Canal organization and the dedicated employees who have kept the waterway operating efficiently for many years.   Your allegations that poor maintenance has resulted in decay and malfunction at the canal are particularly disturbing. You do not quote a single canal employee responsible for maintenance and improvement of the facility. Your reporter apparently did not speak to any of the hundreds of canal engineers, managers or skilled craftsmen who recognize maintenance as the key to the successful operation of the canal and who are proud of the top quality work performed here 24 hours a day, every day of the year.   Before and since my appointment as the first Panamanian administrator of the Panama Canal Commission, I have had many opportunities to observe most of the areas of operation of the waterway, including important segments of the canal's locks system, transit support equipment and the fully equipped maintenance shops.    I can confidently state that the waterway is in excellent condition and is providing high quality transit service to our customers. This high standard of performance will continue to be the primary management objective of the Panama Canal Commission.   Each year, we spend more than $100 million on canal maintenance and improvements. Recent years have seen such improvements in our programs as the development of computerized maintenance management systems","excerpt":"acquisition of modern tugboats, launches and locomotives; improved fendering at all locks; widening and deepening of channel entrances, and a multimillion-dollar marine firefighting system.

It is \\"Green Magic,\\" a Ferrania-color travel film that recounts in bold and vivid details a 7,800-mile jeep trip across the midriff of South America.Let us advise the squeamish not to walk into this handsome film in the mood of serene relaxation they might have for a Fitzpatrick Travelogue. For Count Leonardo Bonzi of Italy, who led the expedition that is described, wasn't out to get simply beautiful scenery and pretty pictures of quaint people in their native dress. He was obviously bent upon filming the liveliest stuff he could find. And he has got an abundance of it—or, at least, enough to make the timid squirm.From some slightly alarming pictures of a group of descendants of African slaves doing the wild \\"macumba,\\" which is a frenzied and frankly erotic dance, he moves on to a gory description of how a herd of cattle is got across a river infested with the voracious piranha fish by the device of sending ahead a wounded heifer to draw off all the finny cannibals. What happens to that sacrificial heifer before the others are safely across is fully shown—and it doesn't enhance one's appetite for either fish or beef.As a final shock for the squeamish, Count Bonzi tosses an a close view of a mortal struggle between two large snakes, with the victor methodically staffing the vanquished into itself.These particularly grisly demonstrations are candidly sandwiched in the 85-minute description of colorful traveling through towering forests, where the ring of axes blends with the cries of beasts and birds","excerpt":"across the grassy pampas, where wild gauchos tend their restless herds, through swamplands and high into the Andes, where an Indian wedding ceremony is seen.The film's director, Gian Gaspare Napolitano, and its two adventurous camera men have done their jobs superbly. Some of the views in color are beyond fault—especially one shot of Andean llamas against a background of Lake Titicaca and the blue sky. Many close-ups of jungle birds are exquisite, and the compositions and colors achieved in the sequence of the Indian ceremonial have a rare pictorial artistry.There is no particular point to the journey, other than to look and see—an endeavor to imply some exploration of South America's \\"secret,\\" as expressed in a sometimes gaudy English translation, suggests the old Fitzpatrick school. A flashback on the melancholy passing of a native rubber-gatherer in the jungle, plainly staged, also arouses suspicion of a yen toward theatricality.But the slight misgiving is fleeting, and for the most part \\"Green Magic\\" is an excellent travel documentary, edited cleverly and supplemented by a fluent score of native music that imparts a range of moving and exciting moods.

Clive Barnes: &#8220;Mr. Bromberg's triple bill is a series of en counters, one comic, one pathetic and one tragic. They add up to an over heated, overhysterical yet finally rewarding evening. And probably the rewards derive as much from the acting of Ron Leibman and the direction of Herman Shumlin as from Mr. Brom berg's sensitive yet undis ciplined writing. By far the best part of the evening is a most remarkable mono logue &#8212; getting on to an hour&#8212;by Mr. Leibman as a frayed, beaten psychia trist. Called &#8216;Dr. Galley,&#8217; this is an encounter be tween a psychiatrist and a university class. The char acter of the psychiatrist is wildly self&#8208;indulgent, and, fundamentally, quite unbe lievable. So for that matter is Mr. Bromberg's writing. Yet the power of Mr. Leib man's playing carries a be lief against all previous conviction.&#8221; For Walter Kerr, see Page 7.

For it is on such an unpleasant evening that a satchel containing 5,000 quid is dropped into the churning Channel waters outside his railway signal tower. And between the time he rescues that satchel and finally turns it and its contents over to the police, a series of consequent circumstances rather ruins his signalman's life.The trouble is that Mr. Newton can't make up his mind. Temptation snarls his resolution, with so much money in his hands. And with Simone Simon, a side-show charmer, also plucking temptatiously at his sleeve, it is no wonder that he tarries too long in depositing his valuable find. While in this state of indecision, he recklessly murders a man who comes looking for the money, and that pretty well does for him. Miss Simon gives him a fast brush, his little daughter dissolves in a geyser of tears and he himself sees his shame and ruin. Too late, he reports to the police.As often occurs in British pictures, the performances here surpass the melodramatic material, which is hackneyed, confused and slow. Mr. Newton inclines to strike poses and declaim in an orotund style, but Miss Simon is remarkably natural and Margaret Barton is fine as the little girl. Most of the others are good, too. But the script is a tattered, soggy thing. Money is still the root of all evil—and of insufferably dull movie plots.
