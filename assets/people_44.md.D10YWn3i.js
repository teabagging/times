Pinafore,'' GILBERT AND SULLIVAN had a falling out over who should pay for new carpet at the Savoy theater. They tried twice more to write together but the results were lackluster. Gilbert's gossamer touch with satire went leaden","excerpt":"Sullivan's ambitions toward ''serious'' music denied audiences the pleasure of his immense gift for deeply lovely piffle.    Sullivan's dalliances with replacement librettists were unsuccessful until he met BASIL HOOD, a much younger man of the new theater scene. In 1899 they wrote ''THE ROSE OF PERSIA,'' a hit in many ways reminiscent of the earlier masterpieces: an exotic if fake locale, a mistaken-identity plot, even a man-eating contralto. Hood's lyrics occasionally approached Gilbertian cleverness (if not his airy wit): ''It is money more than manners nowadays that makes a man/And the man may make his money in such manner as he can.'' But as ALBERT BERGERET, the artistic director of the NEW YORK GILBERT & SULLIVAN PLAYERS, points out, ''The Rose of Persia'' also departs from the canonical works, anticipating the merger of operetta into the developing musical-theater style. For one thing there's a lot of dancing.    Perhaps because of that dancing (Savoyards are not notably light-footed) or because of its other hybrid qualities, ''The Rose of Persia'' is almost never performed. But as a highlight of their 33rd season, which begins on Friday with ''THE YEOMEN OF THE GUARD'' and continues through Jan. 14 with many a ''MIKADO,'' the G&S players will offer a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see what might have happened had Sullivan not died in 1900, in the midst of a second collaboration with Hood. But somehow the New York Hood & Sullivan Players doesn't sound quite right. ''The Rose of Persia,'' Jan. 11 at 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212; $40 to $96.
