For \\"The African Lion,\\" the latest item in Walt Disney's True-Life Adventure series, which opened there yesterday, is quite as vivid, informative and exciting as a fast safari to the African plains.As a matter of fact, we're fairly certain that no visitor to the famous high plateaus of Kenya and Tanganyika, where the excellent color footage of this picture was exposed, ever succeeds in seeing as much of the local wild life or getting as close to it as one does in this handsome film. Indeed, to be very much closer than one is (or seems to be) in several scenes would be a little too close for comfort. Thank Heaven for the telephoto lens!And the creatures observed in thrilling close-up are not only the lordly lions, but also elephants, hippos, leopards, baboons, cheetahs, giraffes and a vast variety of beasts and birds. Almost three years of camera scouting in the African bush by Alfred and Elma Milotte, Mr. Disney's fine team of wildlife photographers, are packed into this picture. And it shows.Commencing with some random inspections of the various creatures that live on the great plains that lie beneath snowcapped Kilimanjaro, this document soon expands into a gripping and characteristic contemplation of the dog-eat-dog-in-nature theme. Life on the plains is not all elephants wallowing contentedly in the mud, baby baboons dangling from branches or lions lying lazily in the grass.Animals must eat to live. And animals that live on meat must catch other animals to eat. The notion is not very happy, but it is nature's law. And so Mr. Disney's boys have faced it. A stalking leopard leaps out of a tree to snag an unprotected wildebeest and stampede a startled herd. A cheetah, the world's fastest animal, runs at a mile-a-minute clip to pull down a fleeing gazelle. A lioness plunges upon a wildebeest after a chase that electrifies the nerves.And then the scavengers gather to help the victors dispose of their prey. The cycle in Africa is no different from what it is on the vanishing American prairie or the Great Plains.The dramatic climax of this record comes with a vivid r√©sum√© of a period of drought and insect pestilence scourging the African plateau, followed by rains and refreshment to establish nature's balance again.A commendable job of direction and editing has been done by James Algar, and an excellent score of music has been provided by Paul Smith. It is notable and much to be applauded that none of the usual Disney bits of whimsical cutting and playful tricks with footage to make for humor have been popped into this film. While there are lots of bright touches in it, such as a baby elephant chasing an egret, there is no attempt whatsoever to humanize or burlesque the animals.\\"The African Lion\\" is the purest of the Disney nature films. It deserves as much honor and attendance as have been bestowed on previous ones.Also on the bill at the Normandie is the thirty-minute Disney cartoon, \\"Peter and the Wolf,\\" a cheerful fable done to the music of Prokofieff. It was initially presented in \\"Make Mine Music\\" in 1946.

says crisis, in which landlords are abandoning 38,000 apts per yr, is rooted in well-meant but short-sighted attempt to protect renters from effects of housing shortages and rising costs through continuation of rent-control system; says while rents have been allowed to rise only 2% per yr, maintenance costs are up 6% per yr, taxes 4% to 6% and interest rates have doubled since '45; this has left 722,000 apts, 1/3 of city's rental stock, with rents of $30 per mo less than is needed for adequate maintenance and competitive profit; says if monthly rents are raised to minimum levels of $25 per room, 588,000 families, most of them on welfare, would need govt help to pay; calculates that since welfare pays recipients' rents from Fed, state and city funds, city's share of increase would amount to $23-million per yr; assuming no external aid for nonwelfare families, city would need $108-million in rent supplements from its own expense budget; noting that welfare pays about $269-million per yr in rents, study proposes that supplements be paid in form of coupons;

Last week one did. The board, whose inquiry turned up troubling management and morale problems, forced the resignation of Albert A. Cardone as chairman and chief executive of the nation's largest nonprofit health insurer. And \\"nonprofit\\" puts it mildly: Empire has lost $250 million in the last two years, and its reserves are perilously low. Two other headaches: the Government, citing poor service, has threatened to cancel Empire's contract to process Medicare claims, and A.T.& T. has accused the insurer of inflating hospital bills. To top it off, Mr. Cardone did not even tell the board of these problems","excerpt":"stunned directors got the word in news reports and meetings with regulators. Finally, the board's patience ran out. Danes Vote With Their Brains    \\"Last time, we voted with our hearts,\\" said a young Dane. \\"This time, we voted with our brains.\\" Last time was June, when Denmark rejected European unity, but last week Danish voters thought better of it and ratified the treaty. To be sure, the treaty has been watered down -- a single currency is no longer required. And not all Danes had their hearts in it: a melee broke out in Copenhagen, as the police wounded at least 10 protesters. The House of Commons also voted to ratify the treaty, moving Britain closer to being the final nation to back unity. China, Instant Powerhouse    Some momentous changes, like the drift of continents, take eons. But in the flick of a statistician's wrist last week, China's economy quadrupled in size -- as someone simply pulled out a new tape measure. Most studies have gauged a nation's output in dollars, but the I.M.F. looked instead at what the local currency will buy. Suddenly China vaulted from being the world's No. 10 economy to No. 3, just behind Japan -- and well behind you-know-who. \\"China is a great power already,\\" one economist said. \\"Many people haven't quite grasped\\" that. But Chinese peasants aren't driving BMW's yet: per-capita income is $1,450; for Americans, who can't possibly afford higher taxes, it is $22,204. An Appetite for Imports    The United States showed a huge appetite for foreign products in March, as imports -- many from Japan and China -- hit a record. That led to the widest trade deficit in nearly four years. Trade with China is a delicate issue, as President Clinton must soon decide whether to renew China's favorable trade status. But what does the trade gap say about the American economy? Pick your expert. An economist called it \\"a shocking number.\\" But a trade analyst saw a sign of confidence. More Video Choices? Help!     It's really happening. The people who bring you Progress have been threatening for some time to invade your home with more electronic information and entertainment choices (just what we need: the average American, starved for choices, already watches television 23 hours a day). But it wasn't till last week that two technologies -- cable and telephone -- started to converge in a big way when U S West, the Bell regional, agreed to invest $2.5 billion for 25.5 percent of Time Warner Entertainment, the nation's No. 2 cable operator. So be sure to duck. There's a superhighway for entertainment and information heading down your street. Picking Up the Phone Crumbs    While the big guns in telephones and cable television are dreaming their futuristic dreams, Leonard Tow has more earthbound ideas -- and is doing just fine at it, thanks. Mr. Tow heads Citizens Utilities, a little-known Connecticut-based company that's making tidy profits on small phone, power and water companies in small markets nationwide. So tidy, in fact, that he's glad to scoop up some of the giants' crumbs. Last week, for $1.1 billion, it scooped up -- from GTE -- more than 200 local phone networks in 10 states, all insulated from big-city competition. So let the Time Warners and U S Wests do their worst; Mr. Tow is happy to \\"stick to the knitting.\\" And it's lucrative knitting, by the way: Mr. Tow's pay at Citizens has been put at more than $20 million. . . . Give or Take $100 Million    What a difference a couple of zeros can make. When A.T.& T. agreed to license Spectrum Information Technologies' patents for sending data over cellular phones, Spectrum said it foresaw \\"hundreds of millions\\" of dollars in royalties. To investors -- desperate to snatch anything that sounds like tomorrow's hot technology -- that was a buy signal, loud and clear. And buy they did, sending the stock from $4 to nearly $12 in just over a week. To insiders, that rise was a sell signal, and sell they did. Then, amid growing doubts about Spectrum's forecast, A.T.& T. said its royalties to Spectrum might reach \\"a few million dollars.\\" Gulp. Spectrum skidded back to $6, in the heaviest trading in Nasdaq history. The Humbling of Honda    Honda just hasn't been the same since Ford's Taurus rammed the Accord out of its spot as the top-selling car in the United States. It could be that Detroit has learned how to make good cars again, and buyers have caught on. But other forces are conspiring against Honda these days. The strong yen means it had to raise prices here, making its cars costly alternatives to Detroit's offerings, and a slow Japanese economy has cut into sales at home. So here's the bad news, as Honda reported last week: profits off 41 percent, North American sales off 17 percent, Japanese sales off 8 percent. Allstate? Well, Almost All    Allstate's imminent stock sale is big, all right -- the nation's biggest initial public offering ever. But it's also long on controversy. Investors should like it -- the price, about $25 a share, looks good. But a lot of other people are not too happy -- hordes of Florida homeowners whose policies Allstate will cancel. Allstate saw $2.5 billion washed away by Hurricane Andrew, nearly half its capital, and it can ill afford an encore, so it plans to drop 300,000 customers to cut potential losses to $1 billion. It makes perfect sense -- except, of course, to Floridians, hundreds of whom took out their rage at a public meeting last week.  Rethinking Medical Malpractice    Lawyers probably like medical malpractice policy just as it is. After all, 60 cents of every dollar is eaten up by lawyers or courts. But doctors, who pay $5 billion or so for malpractice insurance, don't like it -- and neither do patients, who often wait years for their 40 cents' worth of justice. Now the President's health team wants to sweep this system aside, freeing doctors from liability and having patients sue H.M.O.'s or insurers. The Clinton team foresees faster payments and lower litigation costs. But no cheers rose up: doctors foresaw intrusive supervision, and consumer groups saw no sizable benefits. Needed, Again: Technology Czar    Bill Clinton stumbled last week on his way to being the Technology President. He had a top techie lined up to be Deputy Commerce Secretary -- John A. Rollwagen, former head of Cray Research -- and hopes for him were high. But Mr. Rollwagen was mired in an S.E.C. insider-trading inquiry, and he withdrew his name. Not that he said that was the cause -- his main reason was \\"culture shock\\" on seeing Washington at work. \\"I knew it was different,\\" he said, \\"but I didn't realize how different.\\" He's got something there. Wait! Don't Tax My State!   With President Clinton facing so much Republican flak in Congress, he can't afford to let any Democrats slip out of the tent. But last week a couple of big ones did, as some senators came up with their own budget plan. They professed a broad-brush complaint: too many tax increases. But their key goal is to scrap the fuel tax, which would batter oil states like Oklahoma or Louisiana. And the two Democrats jumping ship are David L. Boren and J. Bennett Johnston -- from, you guessed it, Oklahoma and Louisiana. A Stock Record Is Dead; Round Up the Usual Reasons    When stocks soar to a record, there must be reasons. No one really knows, of course; anyone who did would get rich awfully quick. It could be anything. Perhaps 72.4 percent of traders had a good night's sleep, compared with 41.3 the previous night. Perhaps astrology is the key. In any case, when the Dow broke through 3,500 on Wednesday, the Thursday-morning quarterbacks had to explain it, and they cited falling interest rates and gold prices after an inflation scare. But rates had been even lower weeks earlier, so why hadn't stocks been higher? Enough suspense. Here's the answer: Stocks rose because stocks rose.

No wonder weekend dining is by reservation only. \\n\\n An aura of celebration and festivity prevails, less for the decor, which is cheerful enough, with flowers, paintings and arched dividers, than for the clientele, mostly happy regulars who know what they want and order without looking at a menu. And therein lies the secret to dining at Romolo's. Order through the kitchen's strengths and dine very well, indeed. Dining Out","excerpt":"STURDY FARE ACROSS THE RIVER"},{"year":"1983","title":"WE remember Manzi's Restaurant from its days on Riverdale Avenue in Yonkers. Tony Manzi cooked hearty dishes, Italian-Italian and not Italian-American (sometimes distinguished by the over-or exclusive use of canned tomato paste, making dishes here taste nothing like dishes there). He would ask diners what they would like him to make.  The dishes decided upon, he would return to the kitchen to turn out some vibrant sauces and succulent meats and vegetables.\\n\\nSoon after the restaurant moved to Hastings-on-Hudson, Mr. Manzi hung up his apron and moved out West. However, Manzi's today retains the name and much of the sturdy style of the old kitchen. And if it misses somewhat in taste and skill, with some careful ordering one can still get a satisfying meal here and in attractive surroundings.

The Greens helped rout the centrist Free Democratic Party in local elections in Hesse last Sunday, emerging as West Germany's new third party.

But it was also clear in these confused weeks that it is not too late for the mainstream parties to regain the confidence of the younger generation - not by using Green vocabulary and not by the politics-as-usual that often passes for leadership in West Germany but by plain-speaking and realistic leadership.

One dancer resembled taffy stretching slowly and then snapping.         Ms. Way's skill at getting her dancers on and off stage was attractive, as was a smoothly gymnastic men's quartet.

Focusing on the work of six noted American designers, the show traces a 50-year period beginning in the mid-1920's, when industrial design became an organized profession, and culminating in the mid-1970's, when the oil crisis and environmental degradation prompted widespread disillusion with the industrial juggernaut. Donald Deskey, Russel Wright, Norman Bel Geddes, Raymond Loewy, Walter Dorwin Teague and Henry Dreyfuss: those were the cream of the industrial-design profession.

This is not to say that Mr. Tarantino has lost his taste for hair-raising excess, only that he now has it much more firmly in check. \\"Pulp Fiction\\" remains bracingly off kilter as it mixes lurid, outrageous elements with sweetly appealing ones, to the point where the viewer never has the faintest idea what to expect.
