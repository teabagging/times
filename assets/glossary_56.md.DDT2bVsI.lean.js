Xanadu proposes to build 2,000 condominium units, housing a minimum of 3,700 people in four 31-story buildings and 10 11-story buildings. The proposal requires a 3,465-foot bridge, rising to a height of 85 feet and touching down on public park land in Glen Island. The plan calls for a helicopter pad with 24 scheduled flights daily, an 800-boat marina and a sewage-treatment plant that would daily pour at least a half million gallons of effluent into western Long Island Sound.

Homey, easygoing and urbanely rustic, Applewood manages to evoke the country smack dab in the middle of the city. Chalk up that feat to its quiet, tree-lined street, the green wood bench on its raised front stoop, the broad fireplace in the middle of one of its dining room's yellow walls, and the seasonal, locally grown produce that works its way into dish after dish.    BAR MINNOW  (718) 832-5500; 444 Ninth Street (Seventh Avenue); $$; Article: 4/27/05.       Bar Minnow's brick walls and tin ceiling give the place the feel of a venerable tavern, inviting customers to sidle up to the stretch of marble bar. The owners, Aaron and Vicki Bashy, who are also the chef and the pastry chef, offer sandwiches, salads and bar food, often based on meats and fish they smoke at their parent restaurant, Minnow, two doors down.    BLACK PEARL  (718) 857-2004; 833 Union Street (Seventh Avenue); $$; Article: 10/12/05.       This is a new spot for seafood prepared by Frederico Duarte, who worked at Dos Caminos and Da Silvano.

With its wraparound windows and neon sign, Cafe Steinhof is just about New York's homiest Austrian outpost. The cooking is simple, and nothing costs more than $13. There are bacon-studded sauerkraut and thin-crumbed, acceptably chewy pork Wiener schnitzel blanketing cold, cubed parsley potatoes, and marinated cucumbers.    MIRACLE GRILL  (718) 369-4541; 222 Seventh Avenue (Third Street); $; Article: 2/9/05.       The popular Southwestern restaurant on 415 Bleecker Street in the West Village opened this branch last year.

SETTE ENOTECA E CUCINA  * [Rating: One Star]  (718) 499-7767; 207 Seventh Avenue (Third Street); $$; Review: 10/5/05.       This new, sophisticated Italian place doesn't let its ambitions trump the relaxed atmosphere or distract it from trying to win diners' hearts in direct, unpretentious ways. The chef, Amanda Freitag, formerly of 'Cesca, has a way of taking familiar dishes and administering subtle tweaks, like tuna, rolled in ground fennel seeds before being seared and topped with olives and preserved lemons.

Calendar: Games and Gardens"},{"year":"2006","title":"A LOT of time and tide has come and gone since the days when New Bedford was, as Melville wrote in ''Moby-Dick,'' ''the dearest place to live in, in all New England.'' The whaling business that cobbled the historic district's streets and built its fine Greek Revival buildings collapsed in the second half of the 19th century. The textile and glass factories that took whaling's place followed suit in the 20th. Now, while sea scallops continue to make New Bedford the top dollar-generating fishing port in the nation, commercial fishing in the Atlantic is on the decline. Tough times and a rough reputation is how the city is generally perceived regionally. ''Thirty-six hours is about 24 more than you need in New Beige,'' said a year-round Vineyarder at the prospect of spending a weekend there. Truth is, though, New Bedford has plenty of history, architecture and small museums to fill a weekend, particularly when you throw in its proximity to some of the prettiest little towns on the coast and a couple of Massachusetts's best and least famous beaches.   PAUL SCHNEIDER    Friday    2 p.m.  1 -- Bringing Home the Oil    When the skeletons won't fit in the closet, you might as well hang them from the ceiling. The fully assembled bones of a 65-foot-long blue whale (immature, no less) and the slightly smaller sperm and humpback skeletons are reasons enough to begin in the historic district at the New Bedford Whaling Museum (18 Johnny Cake Hill","excerpt":"508-997-0046; www.whalingmuseum.org.). At the top of Johnny Cake Hill, the museum isn't a recent tourist attraction concocted by the Chamber of Commerce to lure tourists off the freeway as they hurtle past on their way to Cape Cod. Founded 99 years ago, it's the pre-eminent museum devoted to the global business that was Big Oil before the Big Oil we know today. It's a fascinating picture of an industry everyone thought the world could not do without -- and then, quite suddenly, did without. Houston, take note.    4:30 p.m.  2 -- A Whaleman's Chapel    As comprehensive as the whaling museum is, it doesn't quite capture the pathos of the age as well as the Seamen's Bethel across the street (13 Johnny Cake Hill; 508-992-3295; www.newbedfordseamensbethel.org), the 175-year-old sailors' chapel where Melville's Ishmael heard a memorable sermon on Jonah. The memorials on the walls offer none of the usual pious rhyming couplets but rather one-sentence tragedies like, ''This worthy man, after fastning to a whale, was carried overboard and drown May 19, 1844, in the 49th year of his age.'' Or, ''His death occurred in nine hours after being bitten by a shark, while bathing near the ship.''    7 p.m.  3 -- Pickin' and Singin'    On many Friday nights in the summer there is high-quality, low-key live music (Patty Larkin, Kate Taylor, Jennifer Roland) at either the Whaling Museum or, even better, in the lovely gardens of the Rotch-Jones-Duff House & Garden Museum (396 County Street, 508-997-1401; www.rjdmuseum.org). It's also worth a tour if you have the time.    8 p.m.  4 -- For Chowderheads    Before, after or instead of the live music, wander over to Freestone's City Grill (41 William Street, 508-993-7477) in a restored 19th-century bank just across the street from the stately United States Custom House designed by Robert Mills, of Washington Monument fame. Under the gaze of an enormous brass monkey, patrons select from a drink list as long as some Chinese restaurant menus. The food is not overly ambitious, which is to say simple and tasty. Syrian nachos ($8.99) are a favorite with locals, the seared scallops ($16.99) are locals themselves and the fish chowder ($3.50, $4.50) is a perennial winner of something called the Newport Chowder Cook-Off.    Saturday    10 a.m.  5 -- To the Sea With Cookies    You could wander the New Bedford docks, a rare fishermen's wharf that actually still belongs primarily to commercial fishermen. But if the day is clear, and this being New Bedford, you'll heed the call of the sea -- at least as far as the beach, anyway. Take Dartmouth Street out of town toward the village of Padanaram, below, a legendary crossroads of old money, older money and really good chocolate-chip cookies. The lattermost are at Cecily's (6 Bridge Street, South Dartmouth; 508-994-1162). There's also a Cecily's on the waterfront in New Bedford proper, but this is the mother ship, and you should consider picking up sandwiches for later.    11 a.m.  6 -- Do the Strand    The back roads from Padanaram wander through some of the more unspoiled stretches of New England coastline south of Maine, places where farm animals still have a view of the sea. There are lovely loop trails at the Lloyd Center for the Environment (430 Potomska Road, South Dartmouth; 508-990-0505; www.lloydcenter.org) if you're so inclined, and they can also put you in a sea kayak and teach you how to paddle it in the protected waters of Buzzards Bay. If you want to sit on the sand, however, your ultimate destination is a little farther down the road. The exquisite, curving Horseneck Beach and the even lovelier and child-friendly Demarest Lloyd State Park have long been overshadowed in the public eye by the wunderstrands of Cape Cod and Nantucket, for reasons having nothing to do with the quality of the beaches.    4 p.m.  7 -- The Big Picture    Get back to town before the New Bedford Free Public Library (613 Pleasant Street, 508-991-6275) closes at 5 p.m. and ask the friendly curator, Paul Cyr, to unlock the art room, where there are a handful of luminous works by a local boy named Albert Bierstadt and a massive George Washington portrait that may or may not have been painted by Gilbert Stuart. To help you get in a historical mood, crane your neck up in the rotunda at the collection of whaling images by Clifford Warren Ashley. (Be sure to call ahead to make sure Mr. Cyr is available.)    7 p.m.  8 -- Candlelight and Catwalks    Take an early evening stroll to see the Nathan and Mary Johnson House at 21 Seventh Street, where in 1838 a certain fugitive changed his name to Frederick Douglass (''Here in New Bedford,'' he wrote, ''it was my good fortune to see a pretty near approach to freedom on the part of the colored people''). Then proceed to the Candleworks, above, (72 North Water Street, 508-997-1294) and take your table. The restaurant is in what used to be a factory for whale-oil candles, and it has long had a reputation as the best dining New Bedford has to offer. Could be: both the atmosphere and the menu are fine and reliable examples of old-school elegance. May we suggest the scallops Mediterranean, served with artichoke hearts and roasted bell peppers ($19.95). Afterward, the rooftop of the Catwalk Bar and Grille (34 Union Street, 508-994-3355) might lure you with its promise of a nightcap under the night sky while a southwest breeze wafts in off the bay. The band, like the scallops at dinner, will be local.    Sunday    10:30 a.m.  9 -- Fair Thee Well    Fairhaven, just across the Acushnet River from New Bedford and settled around 1660, much earlier than New Bedford, is well worth a visit before leaving the area. The streets of the Poverty Point neighborhood, above, are lined with houses dating back to the 18th and early 19th centuries. In 1843, the first Japanese person known to have lived in North America arrived in Poverty Point on a whaling ship that was partly owned by Franklin Delano Roosevelt's maternal grandfather, who lived in town. In the 1890's in the Point, Joshua Slocumb built the Spray, a 36-foot sloop in which he became the first to sail around the world solo. Now that's the kind of history you can sink your teeth into. For lunch, sink into the pan-seared scallops for $10.99 at Margaret's (16 Main Street, 508-992-9942), a cheerful place that yachties from all over know is worth a voyage to Fairhaven all on its own.    A Little Shore Leave       New Bedford's airport is locally famous for having graveyards at both ends of a runway, but it serves only Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. Otherwise, the closest commercial airports are in Providence, about 25 minutes away, or Boston, about an hour away. Starting July 1, you can take a ferry from Montauk, N.Y., via Block Island, R.I. (631-668-5700, www.vikingfleet.com).     For accommodations, consider one of the many bed-and-breakfasts in grand old homes. The Davenport House Bed & Breakfast is in a 1912 Jacobethan Revival-style home with a generous porch and deck (124 Cottage Street; 508-999-1177; www.davenporthouseb2b.com); rooms are $75 to $125.      Captain Haskell's Octagon House (347 Union Street,508-999-3933; www.theoctagonhouse.com) is Victorian through and through, and welcomes pets; $80 to $165.      Across the river in Fairhaven, the elegant Edgewater Bed & Breakfast (2 Oxford Street; 508-997-5512; www.rixsan.com/edgewater) dates back to 1760. It has water views and four-poster beds; $90 to $145.

H., Yonkers  Answer:Weekly charter flights to Rome can be booked through Fantasy Holidays (366 North Broadway, Jericho, N.Y. 11753","excerpt":"516-935-2970) or, out of state, 800-645-2555). The flights, departing Friday evenings from Kennedy Airport and going via Paris, are on Boeing 707's of Skystar International, the New Jersey-based charter service. Return flights are on Saturdays. Round-trip fares are $398 on some dates and $498 on others and rise to $598 for the Christmas period. The lower rates generally apply to November and January, when demand for seats is lower. (On Alitalia, the Italian airline, a 21-day, advance-purchase fare from New York to Rome costs, from Nov. 1, $729 on weekdays and $779, weekends, round trip, nonstop.) Fantasy operates a year-round program to Rome; in spring the service is expected to continue with nonstop flights on another charter airline, Tower Air. The company also offers packages of air fare and seven nights' accommodations in the city, starting at $499 a person. This is generally a slow time of year for charter flights to Europe, and this past season has not been busy. It is expected that other operators will be offering charters to Rome from next April.

The first step was to appoint a respected environmentalist, Albert F. Appleton, to the job of Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection.   Commissioner Appleton arranged to share enforcement power of this law with the Department of Transportation so that more agents could be on the street to go after violators. Eight agents from the two departments are assigned to this job on a full-time basis, and a total of 42 agents enforce this and other provisions of the city's air and noise pollution laws. In addition, on Aug. 15, 1990, Commissioner Appleton deputized 47 members of the Grand Central Partnership's security force to enforce the law in the 53 square blocks around Grand Central Terminal.   When the temperature outside is over 40 degrees, all vehicles except buses are allowed to idle for three minutes. When it is under 40 degrees, buses may also idle for three minutes. In fiscal year 1989, 242 violations were issued for violating this law. During the first three months alone of the city's new enforcement policy, beginning in July 1990, 293 violations were issued","excerpt":"517 had been issued as of Nov. 30.

Playing for the first time after a two-week layoff, Lincoln barely eliminated Hillcrest of Queens, 52-49, in overtime.   Darryle Flicking led the scoring for Lincoln with 19 points, but the game wasn't settled until the final three seconds of the three-minute overtime when Corey Johnson sank a pair of free throws. That put the Railsplitters (23-3) up by 3 points and into the semifinals, where their opponent will be Manhattan Center, runner-up to Grady in last year's final. School Basketball","excerpt":"52-49 Overtime Victory For Lincoln of Brooklyn"},{"year":"2005","title":"WHEN the Spaniards arrived in the Valley of Mexico in the 16th century, they found the sprawling Aztec city of Tenochtitlán, destroyed it and built a new one on top of it. But they never really succeeded in burying the past. Mexico City became the largest city in the Western Hemisphere, a nexus of Latin American art and political thought. Today, after difficult adjustments to globalization and the precipitous devaluation of the peso from around 3 to the dollar to nearly 11 over 12 years -- often cited as a cause for a spike in crimes like kidnapping and robbery -- the city remains a teeming, vibrant and joyful place. Even the skies are blue again because of new laws that restrict auto use. Despite all the layers time has imposed, from the colonial past to the present day of ''nuevo cine Mexicano'' and ''techno-rave en Español,'' even a weekend visitor will still feel the spirit of the old Aztec capital ever present alongside the new.   ED MORALES    Friday    3 p.m.  1. Barefoot in the Bosque  With more than 2,100 acres of greenery, Chapultepec Park is an oasis in the heart of Mexico City. It's also the home of two major museums, the Museo Nacional de Antropología (Paseo de la Reforma","excerpt":"52-555 553-6253; 38 pesos, or about $3.55 at 10.7 pesos to the dollar) and the Museo de Arte Moderno (Paseo de la Reforma; 52-555 553-6233; 38 pesos). The anthropology museum, which goes back to the 18th century, has an array of displays on the life and culture of Mexico's indigenous people. One features a full-size re-creation of an Aztec ballgame that at times required ritual human sacrifice if the ball was played contrary to the direction of the sun. The art museum has works by Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Rufino Tamayo in its permanent collection. If you're lucky, you may also see members of the Voladores de Papantla performing outside the anthropology museum in an indigenous rite, above, in which they ''fly'' from ropes twisted around a pole.    6:30 p.m.  2. Condesa Cocktail  The Condesa is an East Village-y area that is as well suited for late-night club crawling as it is useful for an early evening drink. The Black Horse (Calle Mexicali 85; 52-555 211-8740; www.caballonegro.com) is an Irish-style pub where Grade Z vampire and kung fu movies are projected on the walls. Pints of Guinness go for 50 pesos, and the funk and jazz bands take over as the evening progresses. For a lounge-ier experience, try the sofa-style ambience at Cafeína (Calle Nuevo León 73; 52-555 212-0090) or at Rexo (Calle Saltillo 1, 52-555-553-5337), where fresas -- literally strawberries and Mexican slang for trendy yuppies -- run wild.    9 p.m.  3. Una Comida Folklórica  Celebrating its 50th anniversary, La Fonda el Refugio (Calle Liverpool 166; 52-555 207-2732), in the touristy Zona Rosa, is a cozy, unpretentious purveyor of Mexican cuisine. Start with the tacos de carne con salsa borracha (beef tacos in drunk sauce, 70 pesos), then the mole poblano (chicken in spicy chocolate sauce, 130 pesos) or the carne asada con rajas y frijoles (roasted steak with pepper strips and black beans, 140 pesos). The interior charm of warm white stucco walls, dotted with copper pots when there isn't an altar set up for the Day of the Dead or other holidays, allows the margaritas to take hold comfortably.    11:30 p.m.  4. El Rock y Electrónica  Over in the Mixcoac neighborhood, there's a line of alt-rock kids waiting to get into the Bulldog Café (Calle Rubens 6; 52-555 611-8811; www.bulldogcafe.com) to see El Otro Yo, an Argentine noise band. The shock of the 350-peso cover charge wears off when you realize you can drink beer free all night. (Shots are 30 to 50 pesos each.) The extremely high ceilings, Moorish arches, skylight and elevated stage give the place a meatpacking-district feel, but the music is strictly indie rock and techno. Then head over to Hotel Virreyes (Calle Izazaga 8; 52-555 521-4180), a youth hostel in the Centro Histórico district, for a more decadent, surf-Berlin electronica nightcap.    Saturday    10 a.m.  5. Shuffle Off to Zócalo  Stroll through the leafy Alameda Central park to the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Avenida Central Lázaro Cárdenas; 52-555 512-1410), a building with a stunning Art Deco interior. There you can see (free) a re-creation of the Diego Rivera mural ''El Hombre en el Cruce de Caminos'' (''Man at the Crossroads''), which was torn out of Rockefeller Center in the 1930's because it included a depiction of Lenin. Continue along the bustling Avenida Cinco de Mayo until you arrive at the Zócalo, Mexico City's huge central square. Framed by the Palacio Nacional (free), which contains more Rivera murals, and the Catedral Metropolitana (free), an amazing 17th-century cathedral with sagging walls, the Zócalo is usually bustling with indigenous fire dancers and rows of vendors selling clothing, hippie jewelry and religious objects. Around the corner is the Museo del Templo Mayor (Calle Seminario 8; 52-555 658-5778; 38 pesos), an outcropping of an Aztec pyramid that was exposed by electrical workers in 1978. It is a reminder that the Zócalo was the religious and administrative center of the Aztec empire as well.    2 p.m.  6. Frida and Los Darks  Behind the tangle of fences at the Buenavista subway station lies El Chopo, a semiclandestine Saturday-only flea market of Mexican punk culture. Bootlegged CD's, DVD's, LP's and posters as well as tattoos and other accouterments of the rock underworld can be acquired. But the real treat is the people-watching, particularly ''los darks,'' a breed of extreme goths. Then head south to the beautiful Coyoacán neighborhood and visit the Kahlo residence (Calle Londres 247; 52-555 5658-5778; 45 pesos), above. The house, now a museum, is strange and gorgeous; don't miss her corsets, some featuring a hammer-and-sickle design. A quick idyllic walk leads to the Jardín del Centenario, which on weekends is a joyous jumble of artisans, musicians and even organ grinders with monkeys.    8 p.m.  7. Una Comida con Clase  The splashy snobbery of a place like the Hacienda de Los Morales (Calle Vásquez de Mella 525; 52-555 096-3054; www.haciendadelosmorales.com) in the wealthy Polanco district, with a piano trio pounding out tunes like ''It's Impossible,'' is the perfect cap to an afternoon of surreal Mexican art and culture. The main house of a ranch that goes back to 1645, it's a bit pricey, but classic dishes like pollo con cuitlacoche (chicken with mushroom fungus) hover around 145 pesos. Expect to hobnob with touring symphony violinists, retired spies and French cigar smokers.    10 p.m.  8. Mariachi Haze  The Plaza Garibaldi is a scruffy egalitarian affair where cab drivers warn not to explore the somewhat dicey side streets. It's famous for the black-clad strolling mariachi bands that are looking to be hired for the night. Visitors and musicians of various types wander with super-size plastic cups of micheladas (beer mixed with lime juice and Tabasco), and couples dance sexual quebraditas in circles around small acoustic bands. Step into the Salón Tenampa (Plaza Garibaldi 12; 52-555 526-6176; www.salontenampa.com), a cantina founded in 1923, and be transported to a golden age in Mexican entertainment by the murals of artists like José Alfredo Jiménez and Pedro Infante that adorn the walls. Stick with tequila shots (Herradura Reposado, 70 pesos), but don't overdo the requests with Tenampa's mediocre mariachis (70 pesos a song).    Sunday    8 a.m.  9. Spirit Tour  Pack, hire a taxi and end your visit with a whirlwind tour to Mexico's spiritual core. First stop: Basílica de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe (northern neighborhood of La Villa de Guadalupe; 52-555 577-6022), where the Virgin of Guadalupe is said to have appeared before a converted Aztec, Juan Diego, in 1531. The processions that surge up the Tepeyac hill to the basilica are amazing. Spend 45 minutes here, then head about 15 miles north of town to the Zona Arqueológica de Teotihuacán. For 38 pesos, you can walk the Avenue of the Dead and leap up the 2,000-year-old stairways to the heavenly pyramids of the Sun and the Moon, above. On a clear day, if you face away from the highways, the swarm of cactuses and eerie stillness will take you back centuries and reveal the mystery of time itself. A taxi from a downtown hotel to both spots and then to the airport will be about 700 pesos.    THE BASICS  Layers of History       MEXICO CITY is served by a wide range of American and international airlines. A taxi from the airport to most downtown hotels is 180 pesos (about $17 at 10.7 pesos to the dollar). Call for your taxi; it is risky to hail one on the street. Two taxi companies are Sitio de Autos Niza (52-555 525-5823) and Servi-Taxis (52-555 271-2560). Buses vary in quality, but the subways are clean, efficient and inexpensive (2 pesos).      Major airlines offer air and hotel packages from $500 to $700 a person for a two-night stay.      The Fiesta Inn Centro Histórico (Avenida Juárez 76; 800-343-7821; www.fiestainn.com) is convenient to the Zócalo area. It has 144 rooms at about $75 a night.     The Hotel Imperial Reforma (Paseo de la Reforma 64; 877-227-6078; www.hotelimperial.com.mx) has 65 rooms and is close to Alameda Central. Rates are $79 to $210.      The InterContinental Presidente (Campos Eliseos 218, 888-424-6835; www.ichotelsgroup.com) is in the Polanco district. It has 659 rooms, and weekend rates start at $124 a night and include breakfast. 36 Hours in Mexico City"},{"year":"1959","title":"double-decker parking system, Ala Moana Shopping Center, Honolulu, accommodates 5,000 cars HONOLULU CENTER OPEN","excerpt":"52-Acre Shopping Facility Can Park 5,000 Cars"},{"year":"1933","title":"Gift of J D Rockefeller Jr nears completion FT.

It has several, but the first in 18 years strives to top them all. It is a Marriott property that opened a year ago and has 575 rooms, including suites, a large spa, three pools, four restaurants, a golf course and its own Starbucks. The hotel is spread throughout a sprawling yet tastefully integrated minipueblo in the Sonoran Desert. But the staffers, though friendly and chipper, appear to be a bit overwhelmed.    THE LOCATION -- Due west of downtown and about 12 miles from the airport, the hotel is nestled among the low hills and majestic Saguaro cactuses of the Starr Pass development and abuts Saguaro National Park.    THE ROOMS -- With just 35 suites, most guests sleep in standard rooms, which are perfectly roomy. Mine was labeled ''luxury view,'' and from the balcony afforded vistas of the surrounding landscape, the city, a spectacular morning sunrise -- and, unfortunately, an eyeful of the trafficked hotel grounds. Inside, the usual beige color scheme was perked up by some creative touches, including a beaten-copper lamp and a brightly glazed pottery plate. Also in the room were a leather club chair and a large glass-topped wooden desk. A dark-wood armoire had two low drawers, a cabinet containing a flat-screen television (with about 40 channels) and a minibar. The new taupe carpet had an obvious stain the size of a fist at the foot of my king-sized bed. The bed, though, was wonderfully firm and topped with feather pillows and a thick down comforter.    THE BATHROOMS -- Behind the cool sliding wooden door was a wide, speckled-gray marble-topped sink with a selection of products by Nirvae Botanicals. A hair dryer and a coffeemaker were stored underneath. To the left was a large bathtub, and to the right were the toilet and a shower with a glass door, honey-hued marble walls and massage shower head.    THE CROWD -- Vacationers, including both couples and families with kids, had a distinctly well-scrubbed, suburban air. Because of its large meeting halls, conferences frequently pack the place.    AMENITIES -- A full-service salon, business center (with computers that cost 49 cents per minute with a $5 minimum), bike rentals, a fitness center, gift shops, a children's recreation program, and hiking/tour guides can keep you busy. The resort's main draws are the golf club, which features a 27-hole course, the Catalina Steakhouse and the 20,000 square-foot Hashani Spa with 23 treatment rooms. The most popular dining option is the Signature Grill (desert-chic style and a low-lighted outdoor patio). A special of blackened sea bass with cactus ($23) was delicious, but service was slow and rough around the edges -- as it was throughout the property on my visit in October. The alfresco Salud cocktail lounge, for example, was a tranquil oasis -- dramatic fire pits, cozy banquettes, high-end tequilas -- until a busload of University of Arizona students, many with open cans of Coors Light, stumbled in and boisterously took over the place for a birthday blowout. ''I don't know what's going on,'' said a baby-faced doorman. ''They just pulled right up.'' Bartenders served the youngsters as hotel guests looked on helplessly.    ROOM SERVICE -- An extensive menu is always available. My All-American Breakfast -- $14 for two eggs, potatoes, toast, coffee, juice and a choice of bacon, sausage or jalapeño chicken sausage -- arrived hot and on time at 9 a.m.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- Standard rooms start at $229 and suites start at $375. Use the spa and the scenery to keep you mellow, and the service glitches may not bother you at all.

On May 27, some 250 prints will be made available, free of charge, by the Office of War Information and the War Activities Committee of the motion picture industry.Made by the special service division of the Army service forces, under the supervision of Lieut. Col. Frank Capra and with the cooperation of the Army Signal Corps, \\"Prelude to War\\" has been in circulation in Army camps, here and overseas, for several months. Succeeding films in the series, already completed and now being shown to troops, are \\"The Nazis Strike,\\" \\"Divide and Conquer\\" and \\"The Battle of Britain.\\"Conflict of Free and EnslavedDesigned as a preface to the series, \\"Prelude to War\\" is a generalized review of some events which preceded the present conflict and of the broad issues for which we fight. Made up from American newsreels, captured Axis films, some staged scenes and a goodly assortment of animated maps, it hammers the single thesis that this is a war between free States and those which would enslave the world. It demonstrates in vivid pictures how the Germans, the Italians and the Japanese were regimented by their leaders with the aim of conquering the world and explains the motivation as \\"just plain old-fashioned militarism.\\"Against the horrifying picture of regimentation in the Axis lands it shows how the American people remained free, pursuing the good life, feeling secure in isolation and indifferent to storm signals overseas. Then it illustrates how the campaigns of conquest began in Manchuria in 1931 with the invasion by Japan, and sketches the further adventures of the aggressors through the Italian conquest of Ethiopia. There it leaves the story to be taken up in the next film, \\"The Nazis Strike.\\"Huston Gives CommentaryTechnically, this picture has been made with a great deal of inflammatory effectiveness. Walter Huston, who speaks the commentary, does so with heavy solemnity and anger in his voice. And Colonel Capra and his associates have used some strong scenes to rouse the blood. Particularly effective is one long sequence of Axis soldiers marching, marching endlessly, to insistent martial music and the heavy beat of drums.As an introduction to a series of presumably more explicit films, \\"Prelude to War\\" has reportedly been well received by American troops. It was obviously made on the assumption that the successive films would be seen. As a consequence, its effectiveness with the public, as a single release, is questionable. Its generalizations are vague and it leans heavily on patriotic symbolism to convey a sense of America. It leaves many obvious \\"why\\" questions completely unanswered. And it doesn't give as compelling a concept of the realities of this war as did the Office of War Information's \\"The World at War,\\" which was released eight months ago. It is decidedly late arriving. But it may still have an inspirational effect—especially upon whatever people have been living, up till now, uninformed.
