Fairy Tale Ending April 6-10 - Each year the Blue Hill Troupe, a group of amateur Savoyards, produces a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta for the sheer love of it and the benefit of charity. The 1982 production is ''Iolanthe,'' or ''The Peer and the Peri,'' and its beneficiary the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center. In contrast to last year's minimal ''Mikado,'' the production is a lavish one involving a cast of 93, with 19 set changes and 250 costumes. The romantic leads of Strephon and Phyllis will be sung by Winthrop Rutherfurd Jr., a Wall Street lawyer, and Anne Fairbanks, an assistant producer with a communications company. Leslie Mackey, who works for a church pension fund, will portray the ''highly susceptible'' Lord Chancellor. That's typical Blue Hill casting, though, to be sure, most members of the troupe have professional training or previous professional experience to back up their work onstage and behind the scenes. Your best bet is probably April 8, when a 6 P.M.  buffet dinner at the Union Club offering such hearty fare as beef Burgundy will precede the 7:30 P.M. curtain at the Hunter College Playhouse, just a hop, skip and a jump away. Proceeds from dinner and the run of the show, including an April 10 matinee, will go to ''Building Futures,'' the Isaac center's youth employment training and placement program.

The 9/11 attacks and their aftermath may have sparked the American general public's interest in placing United States history in an international perspective. However, American historians have not been reflexively spurred by these events ''to shed the America-centered perspective of the founding fathers school'' of historiography and ''look at the American past as a single stream in a larger global current.'' In fact, the development of a globally oriented ''United States international history'' has been under way for the better part of two decades, given significant impetus by the cold war's end and growing interest in the phenomenon of globalization during the 1990's.    Bernard Bailyn, cited by Gewen, was not alone during the 1990's in encouraging Harvard Ph.D. students in American foreign relations history, of which I was one, to think beyond an America-centric analysis. Ernest May and especially Akira Iriye inspired their graduate students, through their teaching and scholarly example, with a desire to explore the complex network of cross-influences between the United States and the world at large. Iriye and May, along with like-minded scholars at other major research universities (such as John Lewis Gaddis and Paul Kennedy at Yale), trained a generation of American international historians to use multiarchival, multilingual sources and reach beyond formal state-to-state relations into such realms as culture, immigration and business.    It makes sense that the general public is only now seeking to understand American history in a broader context. The post-cold-war international system and globalization theories that encouraged new historiographic perspectives in the 1990's were abstractions","excerpt":"terror attacks and war are not.

Morgan at Mystic Seaport. The event marks the author's 177th birthday and the 11th annual reading of his epic novel of the sea, attended by dozens of staunch literary insomniacs. It will end with the sharing of a giant birthday cake at noon on Thursday.   Jack Putnam of the South Street Seaport Museum in Manhattan has memorized several chapters which he will recite, assuming the character and voice (so far as anyone can determine) of Melville. Readings are also handled by members of the seaport staff and the audience, and there will be costumed role players and chanteymen to lend atmosphere.   While there is no obligation to stay for 24 hours, some people do, fortified with food and something comfortable to recline on. Others may wander in and out at random.    Admission is free with Seaport admission of $16, $8 for children 6 through 15. Mystic Seaport is 1 mile south of Exit 90 from Interstate 95 in Mystic. The number for more information is 572-5315.    MUSICAL 'MIRETTE'   A new musical called ''Mirette,'' based on ''Mirette on the High Wire,'' the book for children by Elizabeth Diggs, will have its premiere on Thursday at the Norma Terris Theater in Chester. The lyrics are by Tom Jones, the music is by Harvey Schmidt, the team that supplied the score for ''The Fantasticks.''   Mirette is a 10-year-old girl living in her mother's boarding house in Paris in the 1890's. The roomers are circus performers and when a new boarder arrives and turns out to be a master wirewalker unable to work because of crippling fear, Mirette's life changes markedly.   Performances through Aug. 25 are scheduled on Wednesday through Friday at 8 P.,M., Saturday at 4 and 9 P.M., Sunday at 2 and 6:30 P.M., with matinees on Wednesday at 2:30. Tickets are $23 and may be reserved by calling 860-873-8668.

Activities for children include their own art playground and a parade of giant puppets on Sunday afternoon.
