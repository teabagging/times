RESEN speaks deliberately yet poetically of her fiber art and her feelings about her work. ''I am always reaching for an emotional reaction and association within myself and the viewer - a tugging at some hidden, secret cord,'' she says. ''My work is a response to my love of the visually tactile. It is also the result of a fascination for the play between light and shadow.''   It is only in the last few years that the Mamaroneck resident has had the confidence to refer to herself as an artist. Although she has been weaving for more than 20 years, it took a series of successful shows and fairs to make her feel comfortable with the term artist instead of weaver.   Her current show attests to both her creative abilities and weaving talents. More than two dozen of Mrs. Resen's pieces are on display at Incorporated Gallery, 1200 Madison Avenue in Manhattan (through Wednesday). This show represents a milestone for her, as it highlights a body of work that is transitional in both form and content. Using her textile art as a framework upon which to build, the artist has begun to experiment with other media in the fiber area - a process that she feels may ultimately lead her far afield from textiles, perhaps to plaster and acrylics.

The Webern piece, brief as it is, even seemed to affect memories of the preceding night, when Parnassus, another of the city's neo-modernist groups, presented recent compositions at Columbia University's Miller Theater.    Webern must now be considered an old master, and this early piece, written in 1909, is not so ethereal and stringent as his later works. But the issues Webern faced throughout his life remained the same: how to create new compositional systems and sounds out of the wreckage of a long tradition. These issues persist in many of the programs presented by these performing groups, which have taken their stand in the modernist esthetic that Webern helped codify. In fact, the quartet's idiosyncratic phrasing, its skittish energy, its internal coherence and replicating and transforming gestures seemed to anticipate the ambitions of most of the other works on these programs.
