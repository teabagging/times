Public-development deals are common in almost every city, but usually they are put together to promote revitalization or economic development.

And the director's attempt to pump up  the dramatic juice with a recurrent nightmare sequence in which one character dreams he is murdered by his best friend seems less illuminating than pretentious.         The movie, which opens today at the Quad Cinema, is narrated by Tom (William  Sage), a shy young songwriter who secretly pines for the wife of his closest friend, Bill (Timothy Cavanaugh), a boorish stockbroker. Lisa (Jennifer Bransford), the woman whom both men love, works for a fashion magazine. When Tom begins having terrifying nightmares that he refuses to describe, Lisa sends him  to her psychiatrist, Dr. Myron Messers (Alan Davidson). Therapy only worsens Tom's paranoia, and he begins hallucinating the doctor's face on his television  screen.

She's even the voice that accompanies the logo of DreamWorks animated films. But she's got her own thing, darn it, and tonight she'll be performing placid, sensitive and sometimes religious songs from her most recent CD, ''Passionate Voice'' (Word Entertainment).    Rockwood Music Hall, 196 Allen Street, Lower East Side; 8 p.m.; $5 donation.    HOLY LAND LIVE  Of all the film festivals in town this month, Homeland Insecurity may be the only one featuring new documentaries by Israelis and Palestinians. Tonight, ''Filming Politics,'' a panel discussion, includes the director Anat Halachmi, whose ''Channels of Rage'' tracked the political transformations and faltering friendships of two rappers in Israel.    Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, East Village; 5 p.m.; free For more information: www.twoboots.com/pioneer    MONDAY 4/4    WORLDWIDE UNDERGROUND  The Juilliard Percussion Ensemble will perform five works that draw from the rhythm of rituals. Christopher Rouse's ''Ogoun Badagris'' takes on the frenzy of voodoo possession. James Wood's ''Village Burial With Fire'' is supposed to be a recollection of a Hindu prince's funeral. The others invoke Balinese ceremonies, the trials of Achilles and the dances of the purely mythical island of Lemuria.    Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center; 8 p.m.; free (tickets required, (212)769-7406).    WOPAT'S THEME  Sure, Tom Wopat is a Tony-nominated actor, but to some ardent fans he'll always be a Duke of Hazzard. Those aren't likely to be the folks who'll show up tonight, when he takes a break from training for the revival of ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' with an evening of song. He's big on the songwriter Harold Arlen -- he just released a CD of songs by the composer, so expect an ''Over the Rainbow.''    Birdland, 315 West 44th Street; 7 p.m.; $30.    FIVE ACTS IN FOUR NIGHTS  Tonight and the next three Mondays the Classic Stage Company dismembers ''Hamlet,'' act by act. Tonight's Hamlet is Michael Cumpsty, with Brian Kulick as director, for Act I.    Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village; 8 p.m.; $15.    TUESDAY 4/5    STRINGED MIGRATION  ''Pulling Strings: Violinists on Film'' pulls together nine programs of filmed performances, by everyone from Isaac Stern to Yehudi Menuhin. The series opens with ''The Art of the Violin,'' introduced by the director, Bruno Monsaingeon.    Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; 7 p.m.; $15. (Through April 19, www.lincolncenter.org for a schedule.)    POET'S PROBLEM  Celebrities reading poetry are often a risible lot, but tonight's benefit for the American Academy of Poets dreamily pairs Meryl Streep with Elizabeth Bishop and Gore Vidal with Walt Whitman. The Times's own Frank Rich will also be on hand.    Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center; 6:30 p.m.; $35 to $75.    NEW ON DVD: CHERRY BOMB  At $239.52, the first four seasons of ''The West Wing'' (Warner Home Video) -- covering 18 discs and President Bartlett's first term -- may be for partisan loyalists only. But with Amazon.com discounts, it's still the least expensive way to spend that much time in the Oval Office.    SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW  John Rose sings in the world premiere of his ''Jerusalem,'' which takes its text from the Letter to the Hebrews from the New Testament. Also on the program: Schubert, Debussy, Ned Rorem.    St. Peter's Church, 619 Lexington Avenue at 54th Street; 8 p.m.; $20.    THE RICHMOND LIFE  The Richmond Ballet arrives from Virginia with two programs of original work never before seen in New York.

WEDNESDAY 4/6    TWO SCULPTORS  Pick an artist: Sarah Sze, whose astonishingly complex sculptures look to be a cross between the works of Rube Goldberg and Martha Stewart, lectures at the Whitney tonight. Down at Cooper Union, the only artist whose love of goofy detritus could rival Ms. Sze's: Keith Sonnier. Tough call for their fans -- too bad you can't TiVo one.    Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street; 7 p.m.; $8. Great Hall, Cooper Union, 7 East Seventh Street, East Village; 6 p.m.; free.    CHARACTER BUILDING  A new television show, ''Character Studies,'' is like PBS's high-minded version of Us Weekly -- the 30-minute show examines the exploits of a single celebrated character from the theater. It kicks things off tonight with a close-up on Amanda from ''The Glass Menagerie.'' Interviews include Julie Harris, Ruby Dee and Olympia Dukakis, all of whom have played the role.    WNET, 10:30 p.m.    BACON DIRECTS  The 10th annual Gen Art Film Festival's opening-night event is Kevin Bacon's feature film directorial debut, ''Loverboy,'' with a cast including the actor's wife, Kyra Sedgwick, as well as Matt Dillon, Marisa Tomei and Oliver Platt. Other premieres follow throughout the next week, and tickets are a lot easier to get for this film festival than the one in TriBeCa.    Ziegfeld Theater, 141 West 54th Street; 7:30 p.m.; $25. (Festival continues through April 12.) For a full schedule: www.genart.org.    FULLY BAROQUE  The trio of John Holloway, Lars Ulrik Mortensen and Jaap ter Linden -- on violin, harpsichord and cello, respectively -- have just released a recording of the sonatas of the 18th-century Florentine composer Francesco Maria Veracini. The Baroque specialists stop in New York tonight to perform Corelli's Opus 5, No. 5, along with bits of Veracini, Scarlatti and more.    St. Michael's Church, 255 West 99th Street; 8 p.m.; $20.

The author Steven Johnson, a contributor to Wired magazine, will moderate.    Celeste Bartos Forum, New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street; 7 p.m.; $10.    SELF-CENTERED OR BETRAYED  In Jean-Jacques Rousseau's play ''Narcisse,'' the hero is supposed to get married, but when his tricky sister presents him with a portrait of himself as a woman, he's so enraptured that he puts the nuptials on hold. The presenting company, Eyeball Planet, is a proponent of ''automatic acting,'' in which movement bears little or no connection to the words being spoken. At the same theater: ''Orange Flower Water,'' about infidelity in Minnesota, is a new -- and far more traditionally acted -- play by Craig Wright, who writes for the HBO series ''Six Feet Under.''    Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street; each at 8 p.m.; ''Narcisse'': $10, through Sunday; ''Orange Flower Labor'': $19 to $28, through May 7.

Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village; $10 for both films.    FRIDAY 4/8    FOREIGN FILMS  ''Masters of Indian Cinema,'' a weeklong film festival, opens tonight with Satyajit Ray's ''Ghare-Baire'' (1984), about an educated woman who obtains a bit too much freedom. It will be introduced by Salman Rushdie; a cornucopia of films from the last 25 years follow throughout the week. Related: this weekend the Asia Society plays host to the South Asia Human Rights Film Festival -- see www.asiasociety.org for a schedule.    Imaginasian Theater, 239 East 59th Street; 7 p.m.; $50 for screening of ''Ghare-Baire,'' discussion and cocktails. (Through April 14, see www.iaac.us for a schedule.)    TWO PHOTOGRAPHERS  The Architectural League of New York is working up a series of lectures by photographers on the subject of contemporary landscape. Tonight the speakers are Stephen Shore and Thomas Struth. They're both world travelers, but the work of the former is as personal as the latter's is precise.    Great Hall, Cooper Union, 7 East Seventh Street, East Village; 6:30 p.m.; $10.    TEENAGERS ONLY  The Museum of Modern Art's Friday evening programs of documentaries and discussion this spring are open only to high school students. On tap tonight is Jeffrey Blitz's ''Spellbound,'' an account of eight teenagers in the anxiety-provoking finals of the 1999 National Spelling Bee. And there'll be pizza!

Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.; $55.    NOISE AND MATH  The band And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead is out and about on tour for its newest album, ''Worlds Apart'' (Interscope). The group is really, really loud, and its members are prone to swearing, but musically they're somewhat uptight, with a penchant for odd time signatures not at all common to post-punk bands.    Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street; 8 p.m.; $20. (Also April 10.)    CUBAN NONVISITORS  The Cuban artist Alberto Casado is opening his first solo exhibition in the United States tonight -- but barring a last-minute reprieve he won't be in attendance, as his artist's visa was denied. Mr. Casado's work draws on techniques of religious kitsch, putting ink on glass or aluminum to make vivid and political imagery.    Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa; 7 to 9 p.m.; free.

THE MINISTRY OF JAZZ  For tonight's benefit for the Jazz Ministry at St. Peter's Church (which holds a vespers service on Sundays at 5 p.m.), dozens upon dozens of musicians will show up to throw down, from Rolando Briceño's Afro-Venezuelan Jazz Ensemble to the Sarah McLawler Quartet to Lou Donaldson to Don Byron. It is the 21st annual memorial concert honoring the saxophonist Lester Young.  619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, Manhattan; 7 p.m.; $15 suggested donation.

MONDAY 3|14    FILMS BY HAND  The Animation Show -- a touring film festival shown in one 80-minute program and run by the filmmaker Don Hertzfeldt and the ''Beavis and Butt-head'' creator Mike Judge -- has come to town for an open-ended run. Most of the films are quite short and computer-assisted, which makes Mr. Hertzfeldt's new ''Meaning of Life'' an epic and a throwback: 14 minutes long, it's made up of tens of thousands of images drawn by hand over the last four years.  Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, East Village. Complete schedule: www.animationshow.com    DESAPARECIDOS  In the early 1980's a group of Argentine women gathered each Thursday at 3:30 p.m. in front of the presidential palace in Buenos Aires to demonstrate against the ''disappearance'' of civilians by military forces. Susana Muñoz and Lourdes Portillo captured the scene in ''Las Madres: The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo,'' an hourlong documentary nominated for an Academy Award in 1985.  Carlito's Cafe, 1701 Lexington Avenue, at 106th Street, Manhattan; 7 p.m.; $3.    DVD'S THIS WEEK: PORNOGRAPHY AND THE NEW AGE  ''Being Ron Jeremy'' ($14.99, Image Entertainment) finds the real-life sex-film star's body taken hostage by the mind of a young fellow lacking Mr. Jeremy's professional talents, which spurs a crisis intervention by an acting coach, played by Andy Dick. The DVD also includes samples of Mr. Jeremy's standup act. The two-disc collector's editions of ''The Incredibles'' ($29.99, Walt Disney Home Video) are available in wide-screen and full-screen formats, and include a short film, an alternate ending, assorted cartoons, bloopers and even an essay by Sarah Vowell, the essayist and contributor to ''This American Life'' who gave voice to the character of Violet. ''What the Bleep Do We Know!?'' ($29.98, Fox Home Entertainment) stars Marlee Matlin as a questioning soul in encounters with real-life New Age philosophers, theorists and channelers of astral beings.

Scott Caldwell as the mother of a vicious African dictator and Vivienne Benesch as her British ophthalmologist.  59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $55.    WEDNESDAY 3|16    BARDEM-A-THON  As part of its series of films starring Javier Bardem, the Instituto Cervantes screens ''Boca a Boca'' (''Mouth to Mouth'') (1995) tonight. In it, Mr. Bardem plays an actor learning his craft as a phone-sex operator. The Bardem devotions continue through April 10.  211-215 East 49th Street; 8 p.m.; free.    ROUGH ROCK, ROBOT ROCK  Swervedriver's two-CD retrospective package is called ''Juggernaut Rides'' (Castle, $26.49), a great title for the band that mixed the basics of rough-driving rock with slight but pretty melodies and wanderlust. Its 37 tracks include previously unreleased songs. The French electronica duo Daft Punk return with the heavy-metal-sampled dance music of ''Human After All'' (Virgin, $18.98); their first single, ''Robot Rock,'' puts the lie to that album's title.    JANE AT LARGE  The actress Jane Alexander stars as the Greenwich Village writer Djuna Barnes in ''What of the Night,'' adapted by Ms. Alexander from writings by Barnes.  Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; 8 p.m.; $50. (Closes April 23.)    RAP REWRAPPED  The Senegalese rappers Daara J are more political than your average street M.C.: they were speech editors and voting advocates in Senegal's elections in 2000. Politics aside, they rap like smooth multilingual operators and tonight may prove that they've got a party-starting beat.  S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village; 8 p.m.; $10.    THURSDAY 3|17    DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE  The director Michele Chivu bravely takes on Jean Genet's difficult and sadomasochistic play ''The Maids,'' placing it in an eerie 5,000-square-foot warehouse and casting two men in the aprons of the title characters.  Chocolate Factory Theater, 5-49 49th Avenue, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens; 8 p.m.; $15. (Through April 9.)    NEARBY COLONIES  Byrdcliffe, founded in 1902, is an artists' colony in Woodstock, N.Y. Intended to be a utopian, self-sustaining community, it has never quite achieved its goals -- but it did create some outstanding Arts and Crafts ceramics and furniture. A new exhibition documents the idyllic scene and the products it yielded.  New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; $10. (Through May 15.)    YOUNG TEAM  The 25-year-old violinist Hilary Hahn plays the Barber Violin Concerto with the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra tonight. The orchestra will go it alone with the Rachmaninoff Symphony No. 2 and the world premiere of a commission by a fellow 20-something, the composer Stewart Goodyear.  New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark; 7:30 p.m.; $24 to $82. (Also next Sunday.)    FRIDAY 3|18    DRINK-FRIENDLY THEATER  Big wigs, aerial tricks and cocktails for all are hallmarks of the circuslike ''Planet Banana (a Rock 'n' Roll Love Story),'' in which a Brazilian chanteuse finds love. The Daniel Jodocy Trio plays the music onstage.  Ars Nova Theater, 511 West 54th Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $20. (Through May 7.)    DANCING NEW  Nayikas Dance Theater is made up of practitioners of Odissi, which originated in eastern India and is one of the world's oldest dance forms. But the dancers are no historical purists; their choreography incorporates multimedia, costuming and the contemporary Indian language of film.  Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea; 7 p.m.; $25, $18 for students and 65+. (Also on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.)    POSTROCK REDUX  The rock band Slint has reunited after 14 years, to the delight of the fans the band members thrilled as teenagers in Louisville, Ky., with their 1994 album, ''Spiderland.'' They have come to town this week for three shows, ending on Saturday.  Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $25.    BEING DAVID MAMET  The American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco has revived its David Mamet write-alike contest. Three-page scripts are due on March 21, so you've got the weekend to get busy. The 10 best entries will be read for the public on April 1 and 2.  For more information: www.act-sfbay.org.    SATURDAY 3|19    NEARLY A QUARTET  The 11-year-old Zehetmair String Quartet, from Germany, has, because of the illness of its second violinist, become for a brief while the Zehetmair Trio. It will play a bit of Schubert, a longer Mozart divertimento and the Gideon Klein String Trio from 1944.  Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall; 7:30 p.m.; $30 to $42.    FILMS THIS WEEKEND  Tonight at 8 on HBO, ''Sometimes in April'' dramatizes the first 100 days of the Rwandan genocide and stars Idris Elba of ''The Wire'' (also on HBO) as the head of a Hutu family. The sensibly titled horror sequel ''The Ring Two'' brings back Naomi Watts and a very angry little girl in a well. And ''Steamboy'' brings anime style to Victorian England, with Anna Paquin as the voice of Ray Steam, the boy who must save the world.    MADE IN JAPAN  A three-day symposium called ''New Design Japan: Cool Ideas and Hot Products,'' sponsored by the Japan Society and the Museum of Arts and Design, today offers a full schedule of panels with specialists. Tatsuya Matsui, who makes humanoid robots (including a mannequin that poses for store customers and collects information on shoppers), will speak at 10:45 a.m. At 2 p.m. Dai Fujiwara, a textile designer for Issey Miyake, will appear on a panel called ''New Shapes and Processes in Fashioning the Body.''  Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street; $75 for today's programs ($60 for 65+ and $45 for students), $85 for all three days ($75 for 65+, $50 for students); registration available on ww.japansociety.org.    HAPPY BIRTHDAY, STEPHEN SONDHEIM  ''Wall to Wall Stephen Sondheim'' offers 12 straight hours of the master of the musical, beginning with excerpts from ''Into the Woods'' and ending with a full orchestra accompaniment to songs performed by dozens of Broadway stars and Sondheim interpreters. Mr. Sondheim turns 75 this month, and to celebrate, the Museum of Television and Radio has raided the archives for gems like his ''Evening Primrose,'' a musical written for television that starred Anthony Perkins and was first broadcast in 1966.
