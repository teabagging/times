Meanwhile, a group representing Sunni Arabs said it would call for a boycott of the elections if the American military and Iraqi government continued military operations around Falluja.

But rapid economic growth and heavy reliance on dirty fuel may soon propel China toward that unenviable distinction.   China's pell-mell industrialization is powered largely by huge reserves of coal, the dirtiest of fuels in carbon emissions. Three-quarters of China's energy needs, from factories to home heating, are now met by burning coal. The result is all too palpable, as I found on a visit to several provinces late this summer. Noxious fumes sting the eyes of city dwellers, haze obscures the views, and acid rain falls as far as Japan in one direction and southwest China in another. More worrisome for the rest of the world, China's smokestacks spew tons of carbon into the atmosphere, increasing the buildup of heat-trapping gases.

Ransom demands range from a few hundred to half a million dollars. The death rate is uncertain, and officials say that many disappear even after a ransom is paid. Seen in one way, kidnapping is just another facet of the security vacuum created by the American-led invasion of Iraq.   A1    Guards in Baghdad opened fire on a crowd of protesters outside a ministry office, killing one and wounding three, as the top American commander in the Middle East warned that delays in forming a government in Iraq could lead to a rise in violence.   A9    Pro-Democracy Rally in Cairo  Thousands of policemen lined the streets of Cairo, preventing a pro-democracy demonstration planned by the banned Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest opposition group, in front of Parliament. But protesters gathered at two other locations to call for free presidential elections and demand further political reforms, and police arrested at least 100 of them.   A6    Ongoing Conflict in Kyrgyzstan  A conflict between the newly elected Parliament in Kyrgyzstan and the old one continued to cloud prospects for the government that seized power last week. The head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe arrived to offer help in mediating the crisis.   A4    Sudan Rejects U.N. Resolution  The Sudanese foreign minister said Sudan would reject any United Nations resolution calling for the prosecution of a citizen suspected of war crimes in a court abroad. The Security Council is expected to vote on a resolution that would send those suspected of committing war crimes in the Darfur region to the International Criminal Court.   A3    Schröder Criticizes Companies  Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany called on companies to stop moving jobs and factories outside the country in search of cheaper labor and lower taxes and to invest in Germany to create badly needed jobs there. Figures show that Germany's unemployment rose to more than 5 million people, or 12.6 percent, the highest numbers since the years before World War II.   A7    Ailing Pope Makes Appearance  Pope John Paul II made a relatively long appearance before tens of thousands of worshipers on Easter Sunday, but when he tried to speak, only an inaudible whisper came out of his mouth. An aide quickly pulled back the microphone, and the pope instead gave several silent signs of the cross as his blessing this year.   A7    Brazilian Suspect Surrenders  A Brazilian farmer suspected of ordering the killing of the American-born land rights activist Sister Dorothy Stang surrendered to the authorities. Other suspects in the case implicated Vitalmiro Bastos de Moura, and led the police to his farm, where they found the pistol used to shoot Sister Dorothy.   A8    NATIONAL   A10-15    A Push From Congress In End-of-Life Cases  Lawmakers of both parties agreed that Congress has a role to play in who makes end-of-life decisions when the patient's wishes are unclear and are considering legislation that would give added legal recourse to patients like Terri Schiavo.   A1    Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority leader and leader of the Congressional effort to keep Terri Schiavo alive, was confronted more than 16 years ago with his own agonizing end-of-life dilemma and agreed to withdraw life support from the patient, his father.   A14    Terri Schiavo's parents, who are Roman Catholics, have long accused the Diocese of St. Petersburg of abandoning them by declining to join the battle for their daughter's life. They now regularly pray with two Franciscan monks, who have taken up their cause.   A15    The legal battle over the life of Terri Schiavo may have ended, but a fervent crowd remains in the makeshift encampment outside the Woodside Hospice House.   A15    Pricey Weapons Plan  The Army's plan to transform itself into a futuristic high-tech force has become so expensive that Congress is questioning the program's costs and complexity.   A1    Law for Troops Ignored  Many nationally prominent companies are said to be ignoring a longstanding federal law that strictly limits financial companies from trying to collect money owed by active-duty service members.   A1    Rove's Expanded Role  In his newly expanded role as deputy White House chief of staff for policy, Karl Rove can involve himself more deeply in issues, like reshaping Social Security, with an official endorsement from the president that allows him to bring the same focus and authority to Mr. Bush's second-term agenda as he did to his re-election.   A1    Pilot Is Barred From Flying  A 34-year-old Panamanian aviator who once went to the same Oklahoma City flight school as the terror suspect Zacarias Moussaoui has now landed on a terror watch list preventing him from flying aircraft in the United States.   A10    Bush Finds New Groove  White House officials, Mr. Bush's friends and Republicans allied with the administration readily say that re-election to a second term and elections in Iraq have made him more confident in office and changed the tenor of his presidency as well.   A10    SCIENCE/HEALTH    New Cancer Project Proposed  Federal officials are planning to compile a complete catalog of the genetic abnormalities that characterize cancer by observing the DNA sequence of thousands of tumor samples, looking for mutations that give rise to the disease or sustain it.

Norcross III, one of the state's most influential power brokers. The man who recorded the tapes says they offer an insight into arm-twisting and greed.   B1    Hybrid Buses Gain Favor  New York City Transit has decided to buy hybrid-electric buses instead of those that use compressed natural gas, a significant shift in its strategy for gradually replacing diesel fuels with cleaner ones, and one that suggests that the agency will focus entirely on hybrids for its fleet.   B3    Problems for Pollution Law  A new law to reduce the air pollution released by equipment at New York construction sites may be weakened before it can ever be enforced because city agencies and contractors are worried about the regulations' costs.

They are also looking at larger fines and new procedures that could jeopardize the licenses of stations that repeatedly violate the rules.   C1    Gossip Is More Pervasive  The gossip industry has become so pervasive and ruthless that it is difficult to break through with a distinctive voice.

Neolithic agricultural communities had appeared in the Indus River valley by 3000 B.C. and cities at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were founded around 2500 B.C. Around 1500 B.C. Indo-Europeans (Aryans) from Central Asia imposed their religion and political system on the indigenous population and generated population movements toward southern India. Indo-European civilization was characterized by caste; everyone was a member of one of four fundamental divisions of society: Brahmins, hereditary priests responsible for higher learning and rituals; Ksatrias, warriors and administrators; Vaisas, merchants; and Sudras, farmers and subjugated peoples. At the bottom were casteless people, known later as untouchables. By the mid-first millennium B.C., Brahminism had declined into a state of religious formalism. That situation prompted two reformations around 600 B.C. the first of which produced the Jain religion; the second, Buddhism. Jainism remained confined largely to India, while Buddhism eventually influenced most of the cultures of Asia, though it died out in India itself. Buddhism was adopted as a state religion by Asoka, third and greatest emperor of the Mauryan empire (325–184 b.c) under which much of India was united for the first time. Following the collapse of the Mauryan empire, Hinduism evolved out of Buddhism, Brahminism, and other local cults and became the dominant religion of India. South India in the post-Mauryan period was divided into numerous states, the most prominent of which was Chola, a Tamil kingdom in the southeast that had extensive trade connections throughout the Indian Ocean. The Gupta dynasty (c. A.D. 320–544), based in the Ganges River valley, established its rule over most of northern India and created what is generally regarded as a golden age of north Indian culture, with flourishing cities and significant achievements in art, literature, and science. In the seventh century, King Sri Harsha created a short-lived feudal empire that united most of the petty states in the upper Ganges valley, while the Chalyuka dynasty dominated southern India. In the early eighth century, the Indus River valley was invaded by Arabs who introduced Islam to the region. The empire of Sri Harsha fell apart, replaced by the petty kingdoms of the Rajputs. The 11th century saw the ascendency of Islam throughout northern India, which came under the shadow of the empire of Mamud of Ghazni, based in Afghanistan. In 1192 the Ghaznavid general Kutb ud-din Aibak defeated a coalition of Rajput states; in 1206 he founded the Sultanate of Delhi, which in the 13th century held off Mongol invasions in northwestern India and brought all of the subcontinent, except for the southernmost states, under its control. While the rulers of the sultanate were Muslims, most of their subjects remained Hindu. Internal rebellions combined with the sacking of Delhi by Timur Leng (Tamerlane) in 1398 weakened the Sultanate of Delhi. In 1526 Babur, a descendant of Timur Leng, conquered all of northern India and established the Moghul empire. Under Akbar the Great, the empire flourished; Moghul culture gave rise to new styles of architecture, painting, and music. In the 17th century, the Moghul emperors were threatened by the Hindu Marathas, whose kingdom on the west-central coast rapidly encompassed most of south India. By the late 18th century, Maratha power had spread to the north, and most of the petty kingdoms of the Moghul empire became part of a Maratha confederacy, owing only nominal allegiance to Delhi. By that time all of India was threatened by the expansion of the European powers. Vasco da Gama had landed at Calicut in 1498, and in 1510 the Portuguese founded a colony at Goa. Dutch traders competed with the Portuguese during the 16th century, and British and French merchants followed in the 17th century. British trading stations were established at Surat (1612), Bombay (1661), and Calcutta (1690). In the mid-18th century, war broke out between British and French forces in India, and the French were confined to a few small enclaves. The growing instability of the Moghul empire in the face of Marathan and Rajput revolts and the expansion of the southern kingdom of Mysore encouraged the British to seek further control of Indian territory. Robert Clive's victory at Plassey in 1757 brought Orissa, Bihar, and Bengal under British control; British rule was extended to the upper Ganges in 1775. Victory over the maharaja of Mysore in 1792 paved the way for British control over the south. British parliamentary acts of 1773 and 1784 placed these acquisitions firmly under government control, and in 1803 the Moghul emperor accepted the offer of a protectorate, and British suzerainty in India was assured. After a protracted war, 1812–23, Marathan resistance to British control was broken. The first Anglo-Afghan War, 1838–42, was inconclusive in Afghanistan but led to consolidation of British control of the Punjab. In 1833 Parliament assumed political control of British interests in South Asia, while private merchants had unrestricted access to the economy. Plantation crops, such as opium and cotton, began to displace agriculture, which made India more dependent on imported goods. In 1857 Indian troops in the British colonial forces staged a mutiny in north-central India that lasted 14 months. In 1858 the Moghul empire was dissolved, as was the East India Company. The government of India was made directly subject to the British Crown, which exercised control through a viceroy and through the British Colonial Office. Queen Victoria was crowned empress of India in 1877. British sovereignty in India—the raj—was a patchwork of direct and indirect rule. In general, coastal areas, river valleys, and strategic frontier regions were ruled by British authorities, while interior states continued as British protectorates controlled by British advisers to native princes. In 1861 Indians were appointed to advisory councils of the viceroy and provincial governors. The Indian National Congress was organized in 1885. In the wake of popular demonstrations in 1905, elections were instituted to choose Indian members of the viceroy's legislative council. Separate electorates were created for the Muslim and Hindu communities, formalizing a divisive force in Indian politics and weakening opposition to British rule. In 1914, with Chinese loss of control in Tibet, India's northern boundary was pushed forward to the McMahon Line, following the highest peaks in the Himalayas. This set the stage for numerous later boundary disputes between China and India, Pakistan, and Burma. The Government of India Act of 1919 transferred some political power to elected provincial officials but left the appointed British governors firmly in control. In that year Mohandas K. Gandhi organized the first passive-resistance campaigns and was imprisoned. In 1935 the Government of India Act created elected provincial legislatures. In the first elections (1937) the Congress party under Jawaharlal Nehru won control of seven of the 11 provinces. Nehru's goal of a united Indian opposition to British rule was thwarted by Mohammed Ali Jinnah's Muslim League, which demanded the creation of a separate Muslim state. During World War II, the British military position in South Asia was complicated by calls for Indian independence. An offer of local autonomy, with independence to follow, was spurned by Nehru, and an Indian National army under Subhas Bose fought with the Japanese. Jinnah's call for an independent Pakistan was greatly enhanced by his support of the British. In 1947, the British raj became two independent nations, predominantly Hindu India and predominantly Muslim Pakistan. Despite its considerable stature in the international community at large, India has been troubled by a number of disputes with its neighbors and separatist movements within its own borders. Following independence hundreds of semiautonomous princely states were brought under control of the central government. The French ceded their remaining trading colonies in the 1950's, and Portugal gave up Goa in 1961. In 1962, India warred with China in a still unresolved dispute over their border along Kashmir and Assam. The state of Bhutan was granted independence in 1971, and in 1974 Sikkim was annexed and its monarchy abolished. India's most intractable disputes have been with Pakistan. Immediately after independence, Hindus in Pakistan and Muslims in India were set upon by the majority populations; hundreds of thousands were killed, and at least 12 million refugees fled over the border in both directions. On Jan. 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu extremist who blamed him for partition. In granting independence, Britain had divided states of Bengal and Punjab between the two countries, but fighting erupted over the status of Jammu and Kashmir, and a cease-fire line negotiated by the U.N. in 1949 has never been ratified as a formal national boundary. In 1989, separatists in the Indian part of Kashmir began calling for an end to Indian rule, and relations with Pakistan have worsened as India accused its neighbor of providing support for the guerrillas. In 1971, after 10 million refugees poured across its border, India intervened in the Pakistani civil war in an action that prompted an almost immediate cease-fire and the creation of an independent Bangladesh. India's main separatist movement involves Sikh separatists in the Punjab who seek the formation of an independent state of Khalistan, but who are thought to be supported by Pakistan. The government is also contending with separatist movements in the northeastern states of Assam and its neighbor Nagaland. The British legacy in India included a sizable national elite, well educated and committed to principles of parliamentary democracy. The English language linked the elites of India's linguistically diverse regions, easing minorities' fears of domination by a Hindi-speaking majority. India's economy had seen some industrial development under the British, but its infrastructure was geared to integration in a colonial empire rather than to independence. Port cities, heavy industry, and plantation agriculture coexisted with widespread rural poverty and the years following independence saw a massive migration of the rural poor into overburdened cities. Under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, India assumed a leadership role in the world movement of nonaligned nations and followed a policy of neutrality in international affairs. The development of good relations between the United States and Pakistan led to correspondingly difficult U.S.-India relations. In August 1971 India signed a 20-year friendship treaty with the Soviet Union. Nehru died on May 27, 1964, and was succeeded by Lal Bahadur Shastri. Nehru's daughter, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, was named prime minister on Jan. 19, 1966. In 1967 the dominant Congress party faced electoral setbacks; in 1969 it split into “Old” and “New” wings. Mrs. Gandhi's New Congress party won control of the legislature. Faced with protests and strikes after the New Congress party was convicted of voting irregularities in 1975, Mrs. Gandhi declared a state of emergency in June; censorship was imposed, thousands were arrested for political offenses, and various economic-control measures were adopted. An opposition coalition led by the Janata Dal party won a massive victory in parliamentary elections in 1977. Mrs. Gandhi was driven from office, and the state of emergency was annulled. Mrs. Gandhi's party was returned to power in 1980, and she resumed the prime ministership. After an army attack on the Sikhs' Golden Temple in Amritsar, Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards in October 1984. She was succeeded in office by her son, Rajiv, who placed the Punjab under direct control of the federal government. On Dec. 3, 1984, methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, killing over 2,500 people. The accident prompted a broad inquiry into industrial safety standards in India. In November 1989, Rajiv Gandhi's Congress party was voted out of office in general elections after people close to the government were accused of taking kickbacks in a government arms purchase scandal. Gandhi was succeeded by V.P. Singh of the Janata Dal party, whose government collapsed after 11 months over a dispute involving Hindu plans to build a temple on the site of a mosque in Ayodhya. (Hindus contend the mosque was built on the site of Rama's birthplace.) Middle-class Hindus also protested an affirmative action policy to set aside federal government jobs for members of lower castes. Singh was followed by Chandra Shekhar, whose minority government served only with the backing of the Congress party. After a parliamentary boycott by the Congress party instigated by Rajiv Gandhi, Shekhar quit the government in March 1991, agreeing to stay on as a caretaker until the May election. The election, postponed two weeks following the assassination of Gandhi, was won by the Congress party, and P.V. Narasimha Rao became prime minister. The Rao government attempted to foster economic growth by relaxing the centralized planning and controls on international trade and investment. This policy produced impressive economic gains despite a concurrent rise in corruption-related scandals. A rise in Hindu extremist feeling, however, strengthened the hand of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party. On Dec. 6, 1992, a Hindu mob demolished a mosque built several hundred years earlier on a Hindu sacred site in the city of Ayodhya; in the ensuing turmoil, riots broke out in dozens of cities, most notably Bombay, leading to the deaths of hundreds of Muslims at the hands of Hindu attackers. A series of bomb explosions killed hundreds in Bombay on Mar. 12, 1993, while dozens more were killed by an explosion in Calcutta four days later. Further riots followed, amid unsubstantiated accusations that Muslims, aided by Pakistan, were responsible for the explosions. In 1993 separatist movements in Punjab and Assam waned, but violence in Kashmir and Jammu increased dramatically; despite several attempts by India and Pakistan to institute effective talks on the issue, violence continued unabated with loss of life in the hundreds if not thousands. The Rao government's economic policies produced good results, but as India's economy strengthened its political stability weakened. The Congress Party continued to lose power to the Hindu Baratiya Janata Party. Congress was defeated in parliamentary elections in May 1996, ushering in an era of short-lived, weak coalition governments under Pres. K. R. Narayanan. Inder Kumer Gurjal formed a government in April, 1997 that fell in November. The BJP won a plurality of seats in March 1998 elections, but, to govern (under Prime Minister Vajapyee) required a 19-party coalition. Fragile authority need not exclude vigorous policy: it was the BJP coalition that carried out underground tests of five nuclear devices in May, vigorously asserted India's claims in Kashmir, and cut food subsidies as a means of reducing the deficit. It was the latter that dislodged the coalition and in April 1999, Pres. Narayanan dissolved the Lok Sabha, preparatory to India's third election campaign in three years. Perhaps sensing weakness, Muslim insurgents launched attacks against Indian forces in Kashmir. But India retaliated forcefully and peace was restored in July, although India continued to blame Pakistan for the violence. In the election results, the National Democratic Alliance, a 24-party coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, won an absolute majority; so, for the first time in 27 years, an incumbent prime minister won re-election. Despite this recent instability, India has enjoyed significant domestic and international achievements in the first 50 years after independence. The nation's territory was consolidated, and separatist movements in various provinces successfully resisted. The federal parliamentary system has proved workable, and the federal government has established its constitutional right to intervene in state affairs under some conditions. India's armed forces are large, well trained, and well equipped, with some nuclear capability. India has maintained watchful, but generally peaceful, relations with two unfriendly neighbors, Pakistan and China. The Green Revolution of the 1970's made the country self-sufficient in food for the first time since the 19th century. India has a large, well-educated middle class and a growing industrial economy. The Dec. 13, 2001 attack on the Parliament in New Delhi by five Pakistan-based terrorists greatly heightened existing tensions between the two countries. While Hindu mobs killed Muslims in Gujarat, Muslim attacks continued, though at a diminished rate in 2002, in Jammu-Kashmir. Upwards of a million troops stood poised on the border with almost daily artillery exchanges. Several terrorist attacks in Kashmir led to U.S. and British diplomatic intervention that eased tensions considerably during 2003.

The Chinese-born human rights activist spent 19 years in Chinese prison labor camps, then moved to the United States and transformed himself into an undercover human-rights investigator who penetrated the Chinese camps.    He was detained by Chinese border authorities nearly two weeks ago as he crossed into China from Kazakhstan (with a legal American passport and current visa), and has been held without access to American consular officials.    In addition, Chen Ziming, a dissident whose release from prison last year was personally requested by President Clinton, was jailed again last week. Branded as one of the \\"black hands of Beijing\\" for his role in the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, he had spent five years in prison before his release for medical treatment.    Although the detention of the two men seems to be motivated primarily by China's preoccupation with internal security, it signals that the United States will continue to pay for its decision to allow President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan to make a private visit to the United States last month. The American side has insisted that it wants to embrace Beijing. But President Clinton's decision last week to lift a ban imposed last year on fish and wildlife imports from Taiwan is bound to be read in China as just another punishment.

Haijing Fu, a baritone from Dalian, staked a credible claim for Chinese singers on Thursday evening when he made a promising Metropolitan Opera debut as Giorgio Germont in \\"La Traviata.\\"    Mr. Fu was a winner of the Met's national auditions in 1988, and he has been singing in Europe and around the United States since then. His portrayal of Enrico in an Opera Company of Philadelphia production of \\"Lucia di Lammermoor\\" last season had a darkness, gravity and flexibility that impressed this reviewer. Those qualities, in a different mixture, impressed again on Thursday.   Mr. Fu's portrayal of Germont had just about everything one looks for in the role -- a commanding but not overbearing presence and a firm resolve to protect the family name, tempered by empathy for Violetta. Vocally, he seemed fully connected to the characterization, taking a stately approach to \\"Pura siccome un angelo\\" and singing \\"Di Provenza il mar\\" with touching tenderness and passion. His phrasing is thoughtful, often beautifully shaped and well projected. And he has a pleasing tone that is steady throughout his range.    The rest of the cast, which included Marilyn Mims as Violetta and Jerry Hadley as Alfredo, was reviewed earlier this season.
