As Michael Korda puts it in ''Making the List'' (2001), his deft cultural history of American best sellers, readers have long gravitated toward novels that, ''like a good French meal,'' leave you ''stuffed, satisfied, overwhelmed, in any event not hungry for more.'' Two recent additions to the fiction list fall into this jumbo-size category: Stephen King's ''Dark Tower: The Dark Tower VII'' (at No. 1 this week) and Neal Stephenson's ''System of the World'' (at No. 18 on the extended list, after making its debut last week at No. 9). King's novel weighs in at 845 pages","excerpt":"Stephenson's, at 892. And those page counts are the tips of twin icebergs. King's book is the concluding volume of his seven-book ''Dark Tower'' series; Stephenson's is the final installment in his three-volume ''Baroque Cycle.'' King and Stephenson don't just want to take a bite out of your weekend -- they want to take a bite out of your year.    THE INTROVERT: Stephen King is, of course, no stranger to this list. Stephenson has appeared here less often. The books that made his reputation, ''Snow Crash'' (1992) and ''The Diamond Age'' (1995), are cyberpunk classics -- they're as brainy and breathless as the day he wrote them. But Stephenson did not make this list until 1999, with ''Cryptonomicon''; it clung to the bottom of the list for three weeks. Of the two previous books in ''The Baroque Cycle,'' Volume 1, ''Quicksilver,'' made the list for four weeks last fall, and Volume 2, ''The Confusion,'' landed at No. 10 for one week this past May. You probably won't see Neal Stephenson hawking this new trilogy on the ''Today'' show. He is not quite a hermit on the Pynchon level, but he's close. (On his Web site, you can click on mini-essays he's written, and they tend to have titles like ''Recluse,'' ''Introvert'' and ''Why I Am a Bad Correspondent.'')

The attack was masterminded by the Baghdad-based Palestinian leader Abu Nidal, now considered a principal terrorist threat to the West. \\n\\nAn Iraqi sought by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 18 years was arrested Jan. 16 at Fiumicino. The Italian police said the man, Khalid Duhhan Al-Jawary, was entering Italy under an assumed name but it was not clear whether he was coming to Italy or just passing through. F.B.I. agents, who tipped off the Italian police, have said Mr. Al-Jawary was charged in absentia in New York, accused of attempting to bomb an El Al building and two Israeli banks in March 1973, the day Prime Minister Golda Meir was to have arrived in New York. The bombs did not explode.\\n\\nBeyond that, there have been several telephone threats, but no disruptions in air traffic.\\n\\nAfter the 1985 attack, the security system was tightened, and it has been further strengthened since the war began. Among the measures are increased attention to identifying luggage and restriction of access. Only two heavily guarded entrances are open at once and only passengers can get into the international terminal of the airport, after showing passports and tickets. At Fiumicino, check-in for what are deemed high-risk flights, on Pan Am, T.W.A. and El Al, takes place in a tightly controlled area. Passengers are screened by airline personnel and, if answers are not considered satisfactory, are further checked by the Italian police. Police inspect all planes before boarding and high-risk flights are escorted by police cars and or helicopters at landing and takeoff. \\n\\nFiumicino, with a heavy flow of international passengers, has seen the largest drop in traffic. At airports such as Turin or Milan used mainly by business travelers, with no separate terminals for international and national flights, the drop in passengers and air traffic has been about 15 percent.

In \\"Tomorrow Is Another Day\\" he is still afoul of the authorities but through no fault of his own. And that is about the sum total of novelty and invention contained in the chase melodrama, which turned up at the Holiday Theatre yesterday. It is pleasantly obvious that he has Ruth Roman as a decorative sidekick through a long flight to eventual liberty and the pursuit of their happiness, but it is a road that has been well traveled and isn't so overwhelmingly interesting as to warrant another trip.Somehow one can't blame the cops for sticking to our hero's trail. Once released from jail—he was the youngest murderer ever to serve a term—he naturally stacks the cards against himself as he picks up an inquisitive reporter and then, fleeing from unwanted publicity, treks to New York, where, to assuage loneliness, he falls for taxi dancer Roman. Before one can say Warner Brothers, a pat situation arises where a cop—a detective lieutenant, no less—bobs up and orders our boy away from his girl. In the ensuing fracas, Cochran is rendered hors de combat and Miss Roman, protecting herself from her erstwhile benefactor, shoots the policeman.At this point, the pair, neither of whom is guilty, decide that it is too hot for comfort and team up. Love and marriage, naturally, enter the picture, and the happy team, now picked up by an itinerant farmer and his family, head for the California lettuce fields. By another strange coincidence a picture of Cochran in a magazine casually acquired by his farmer friend in a barber shop, eventually tips the law to the fleeing couple. But the law, it appears, is not blind. It knew all along that no one was to blame. Just wanted to clear up the case, that's all.As the unfortunate ex-con, Steve Cochran is a competently suspicious man but one who is still anxious for the things he has missed in prison. Ruth Roman is attractive as the wife harassed by the fact she is keeping the truth from her trusting mate and Ray Teal, Lurene Tuttle and Bobby Hyatt, as the farmer family who befriend them, are adequate in the other principal roles.Apart from one sequence when the pair hide in a car being transported by truck to effect their escape, \\"Tomorrow Is Another Day\\" follows an ancient formula. Its tensions are manufactured and apparent. List \\"Tomorrow Is Another Day\\" as just another picture.

Mr. Coleman has been doing this for a while now, and it was fascinating to see how far he has taken the idea. His formula has stayed the same, but he has made it all more complex and pliable, with pieces weaving in and out of one another and inspiring fervent improvisations. But its limitations have stayed the same.   At the opening of its five-night stand, the band -- featuring Ravi Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Andy Milne on piano, Reggie Washington on bass and Gene Lake on drums -- never lost some of the chill that Mr. Coleman's music often has. As able as the musicians are at playing the music, with its difficult meters and distinct rhythmic conception, the group rarely raised it above the level of a musician's exercise, technically interesting but mostly mute emotionally.

And, the officials said, the Generals reached a basic financial accord on Walker with his lawyer, Jack Manton, on Feb. 9, a week before Georgia's Heisman Trophy-winning tailback signed the tentative document.

This is a movie about loss of innocence, and it's supposed to be a comedy. Yet it begins with a scene in which a teen-age girl kicks a teen-age boy in the groin — and relations between the sexes never get much better during the course of the story.The premise of \\"Little Darlings,\\" an idea that is not without its comic possibilities, is that two 15-year-old girls at a summer camp make a bet over which one can lose her virginity first. This happens very early in the movie and the screenplay twists an ankle getting even this far: it dreams up a mean little vixen named Cinder (Krista Errickson), who immediately pegs Ferris (Tatum O'Neal) and Angel (Kristy McNichol) as sexually inexperienced, goads them into the bet, and then pressures everyone else at Camp Little Wolf into taking sides. The other girls are clearly just as virginal as Ferris and Angel, and in any case their intense interest in the bet seems a little strange. Not even trampy Cinder spends any time at the boys' camp across the lake. They'd all prefer to stay home and nag Angel and Ferris into action.Eventually, one of the contestants wins. But the film has gone to such lengths to depict sex as a wretched ordeal, something to dread, that small wonder the girl who has been deflowered spends the rest of the story weeping. If \\"Little Darlings\\" were funnier about other things, it might have the wherewithal to keep the plot's sexual undertones from becoming unpleasant. But the movie's jokes are listlessly vulgar, and they fit in all too well with the prevailing nasty air.Miss O'Neal and Miss McNichol, both lovely and accomplished actresses, are much better than their material. And they go a long way toward lending the story a little charm. Miss O'Neal is supposed to be rich and unhappy — we know that because she arrives for camp in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a white suit and a pout. Miss McNichol is supposed to be tough and impoverished, and it is she who delivers the opening kick. There isn't much warmth or empathy between them, but that helps further the notion that they're feuding. It doesn't explain what they're doing at the same camp, though, or why neither one is teased about her economic status or her clothes or her parents or anything else — 15-year-old girls who can be cruel about sex can also be cruel about plenty of other things. \\"Little Darlings\\" is just too fixated to take that into account.\\"Little Darlings,\\" which opens today at the Forum and other theaters, has a screenplay so inept that it defines one character entirely by a succession of funny hats (like a propeller beanie), and has Angel's mother begin virtually every line with \\"Angel, I'm your mother,' or something of the sort. The teen-age characters are often more inarticulate than they need to be — \\"You're drunk.\\" \\"You're cute,\\" goes one exchange. It doesn't help to have Miss McNichol's beau played by a young actor (Matt Dillon) even more inexpressive than his lines. Mr. Dillon, incidentally, spends much of his time bare-chested, and is presented as much more of a sex object than Miss McNichol. That's another of the movie's curiosities.\\"Space Colonies: The Final Frontier,\\" a film exploring the development and use of space colonies, will be shown weekends through Aug. 3 at the Hudson River Museum, 511 Warburton Avenue in Yonkers.

And near the beginning of Mr. Ross's delightful new show, \\"Noel Coward and His Ladies,\\" in the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, he describes how Coward \\"burst upon the scene in London\\" and made long ivory cigarette holders an essential social prop for fashionable young men.    The show, in which Mr. Ross is joined by Jeanne Lehman, a redheaded singer whose pealing soprano contrasts bracingly with Mr. Ross's wry, clipped delivery, is a seamlessly written and performed party piece.

He also his a goalpost and slid head first into the net on another attmpt.    \\"I was due,\\" Miller said. \\"Lately I've been getting all kinds of chances. It's not just me.

But you can prepare for the ice-cream part of the equation by making a mental list of sources, as I do every summer. It's a lonely business, though. Suggest an outing to an ice-cream parlor, and your average narcissistic, control-freak Manhattanite looks at you in horror, given his or her assumption that the purpose of food is nutrition and discipline, not pleasure.\\n\\nSo repeat after me: There is no reason a healthy adult cannot have an ice-cream cone every now and then. It's just a matter of calories, not a never-ending test of virtue.\\n\\nEven Haagen-Dazs, which is about as rich as ice cream gets, has only 267 calories in a half-cup, which translates to two moderate scoops or one sizable one.\\n\\nIce-cream parlors provide built-in portion control, not to mention freezers that work. You'll eat what you ordered, which is certain to be less than the pint you might take home. And please don't resort to imitation ice cream. If you want a cold, low-calorie dessert, eat cantaloupe. \\n\\nOnce you've justified your ice cream, picking your spot takes some thought. There seem to be fewer choices than there were in the mid-1980's. Most of the gelaterias are gone","excerpt":"Steve's and Ben & Jerry's survive in diminished numbers; some local institutions, like the Agora on the Upper East Side, are dead, and to judge from my research, a number of others should be. There's a lot of second-rate ice cream out there, being served in depressing settings. \\n\\nHere are some places to get ice cream that's worth leaving home for.\\nMANHATTAN\\n\\nDean & DeLuca Cafe \\n\\n\\n121 Prince Street, (212) 254-8776.\\n\\n\\nTHE SCENE: At Dean & DeLuca Cafe, the Ciao Bella gelato is beyond reproach, what there is of it. (The selection is limited.) But the main point is the opportunity to sit down and recover from a shopping or art assault on SoHo.\\n\\nHOURS: Mondays to Thursdays, 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, 8 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Sundays, 9 A.M. to 8 P.M.\\n\\nFLAVORS: They vary but have included chocolate hazelnut, strawberry, zabaglione, amaretto, melon ice, passion fruit ice, orange passion fruit ice and lemon ice.\\n\\nTASTE TEST: Vanilla was not available when I was there. No plain chocolate was available, either. The chocolate hazelnut was velvety, and the hazelnut bits somehow escaped sogginess, the typical problem with ice cream that contains nuts.\\n\\nPRICE: $2.50 for a 6-ounce serving, which is more than a dip's worth (you can try two or three flavors), along with a Belgian rolled cookie.\\n\\nSETTING: The expanse of white tile and white brick create an airy effect. \\n\\nSEATING: At tables, and lots of them.\\n\\nBONUS: There are swell sandwiches to eat before your ice cream, among them ham on a biscuit and zucchini, yellow squash and tomato on polenta, and meringues to eat with the ice cream. Iced coffee is available, too. (Iced coffee is the ideal beverage to accompany ice cream, adding the kick of caffeine to the rush of sugar.)\\nGodiva \\n\\n\\n793 Madison Avenue, between 67th and 68th Streets, (212) 249-9444.\\n\\n\\nTHE SCENE: Chocolate candy may be Godiva's raison d'etre, but Godiva's ice cream was the best I found. (There are several Godivas in town, but only two serve ice cream.) The ice cream's satiny texture and perceptible freshness made me extremely happy to be there. I had three favorites here: the light but perfectly satisfying chocolate, the very adult (for its balance of chocolate and liqueur) chocolate Grand Marnier, and the French vanilla amaretto. (The amaretto in question apparently refers to the cookie, not the liqueur.) The only complaint: five of the six flavors are variations on chocolate. Still, the bill of fare is understandable given the nature of the place. The other Godiva location that serves ice cream (245 Columbus Avenue, between 71st and 72d Streets) is also impressive, although I prefer the Madison Avenue outpost.\\n\\nHOURS: Mondays through Wednesdays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 7 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 5 P.M.\\n\\nFLAVORS: French vanilla, French vanilla amaretto, chocolate, chocolate Grand Marnier, chocolate raspberry cordial and mocha hazelnut.\\n\\nTASTE TEST: Vanilla: pure, not cloying. Chocolate: wears well.\\n\\nPRICE: $1.75 a dip (no cones).\\n\\nSETTING: The polished jewel box of an interior is lovely, and the air-conditioning is marvelously glacial.\\n\\nSEATING:Six black tables, with flowers.\\n\\nBONUS: The iced cappuccino is exceptional and almost makes up for the absence of plain coffee. (Espresso and cappuccino are the only caffeine options here.)\\nHaagen-Dazs \\n\\n\\n30 West Eighth Street, (212) 979-6200.\\n\\n\\nTHE SCENE: Ubiquitous in delis and supermarkets, Haagen-Dazs has become the standard-setter for premium ice cream. The quality is very high, even if the denseness of the ice cream can seem almost suffocating. Haagen-Dazs has numerous ice-cream shops in Manhattan. I visited the one on Eighth Street for purely sentimental reasons.\\n\\nHOURS: Mondays through Thursdays, 11:30 A.M. to 11:30 P.M.; Fridays, 11:30 A.M. to 1:30 A.M.; Saturdays, 11:30 A.M. to 1:30 A.M.; Sundays, 11:30 A.M. to 11:30 P.M.\\n\\nFLAVORS: Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, brandied black cherry, pralines and cream, butter pecan, macadamia brittle, deep chocolate peanut butter, Swiss almond vanilla, coffee, cappuccino, rum raisin, mocha double nut, chocolate chocolate mint, vanilla fudge, deep chocolate fudge, peanut butter vanilla, chocolate chocolate chip, vanilla caramel triple nut and vanilla chip. (Flavors vary.)\\n\\nTASTE TEST: Vanilla: Rich and perhaps too sweet. Chocolate: Wonderfully dark, rich and bittersweet.\\n\\nPRICE: $1.80 for one dip.\\n\\nSETTING: Counter set on a diagonal to the street, with doors open for alfresco effect.\\n\\nSEATING: None, unless you count the benches in nearby Washington Square Park.\\nMinter's \\n\\n\\nPier 17, third level, 89 South Street, South Street Seaport, (212) 608-2037.\\n\\n\\nSCENE: Minter's doesn't get much press, but I was pleasantly surprised by its ice cream, which tasted fresher than any other on my tour except Godiva's. Another surprise: what a good time I had at the South Street Seaport, generally considered to be a tourist trap. (Minter's also has a shop in the street-level courtyard of the World Financial Center, 250 Vesey Street.)\\n\\nHOURS: Sundays through Thursdays, 10 A.M. to 10 P.M. ; Fridays and Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 2 A.M.\\n\\nFLAVORS: Vanilla, triple chocolate, strawberry, vanilla Swiss almond, butterscotch vanilla, vanilla chocolate chip, chocolate chocolate chip, coffee, coconut, black raspberry, mint chip, butter pecan, banana, cookies and cream, bananas Foster, Kahlua and cream.\\n\\nTASTE TEST: Vanilla: fine, if lacking in nuance. Chocolate: lightweight but refreshing.\\n\\nPRICE: $1.90 for one dip.\\n\\nSETTING: Counter, with white tile and neon.\\n\\nSEATING: Yes, if you can snag one of the tables in the center of the food court, which takes some doing on weekends, when the crowd is chaotic.\\n\\nBONUS: Ice cream may be consumed outdoors, near the water.\\nBROOKLYN \\n\\nLogue's \\n\\n\\n6920 Third Avenue, at 69th Street, Bay Ridge, (718) 748-6650.\\n\\n\\nSCENE: The boroughs may have the odd Haagen-Dazs shop, but homemade, old-school ice cream, which is less dense than the post-modern version, lives on. In Brooklyn, the Logue family also owns Hinsch's and Once Upon a Sundae in Bay Ridge, but the one that did it for me was Logue's, which has a very nice \\"Happy Days\\" feeling. The ice cream is good, if not great, but the place has a sense of historic resonance that you don't find very often. (The ice-cream parlor dates back to 1901.)\\n\\nHOURS: Mondays through Saturdays, 8 A.M. to 6:30 P.M. Closed Sundays.\\n\\nFLAVORS: Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, cherry vanilla, chocolate chip, butter pecan, maple walnut, coffee, pistachio, chocolate chocolate chip.\\n\\nTASTE TEST: Vanilla: very sweet. Chocolate: the best flavor here, with intense cocoa flavor.\\n\\nPRICE: $2 for one dip.\\n\\nSETTING: The lighting is heartening; the beveled mirrors provide a sense of mystery. The air-conditioning is solid, too.\\n\\nSEATING: You can sit at the mahogany counter or in booths.\\n\\nBONUS: The sandwiches and burgers are decent, and the waitresses are the real thing.\\n\\nQUEENS \\n\\nEddie's Sweet Shop \\n\\n\\n105-29 Metropolitan Avenue, at 72d Road, Forest Hills, (718) 520-8514.\\n\\n\\nSCENE: Eddie's Sweet Shop is another holdover from the past. (There has been an ice-cream parlor on the site for well over half a century.) The ice cream is even better than at the Logues' parlors, and the banana split is exceptional. Just don't go expecting to grab something to eat before your ice cream, which is the only order of business here.\\n\\nHOURS: Tuesdays through Fridays, 1 to 11:30 P.M., Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 11:30 P.M. Closed Mondays.\\n\\nFLAVORS: Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, vanilla chip, rum raisin, coffee, butter pecan, walnut, coffee chip, raspberry, cherry vanilla, vanilla fudge, tutti-frutti, banana, raspberry sherbet, orange sherbet.\\n\\nTASTE TEST: Vanilla: unassuming, which makes it great when covered with hot fudge and walnuts. Chocolate: intense, if unsubtle.\\n\\nPRICES: $1.35 for a small cone, $1.50 for a small dish, $3.75 for a basic banana split.\\n\\nSETTING: Soulful, with a wood counter, tile floor and ceiling fans. \\n\\nSEATING: Counter, tables and booths.\\n\\nBONUS: A case of ceramic figures, along the lines of little horses, for sale.
