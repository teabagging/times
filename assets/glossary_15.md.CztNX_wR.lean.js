It is a picture that hops from melodrama to low comedy. Miss Gaynor, however, does her best with every scene. She did not write the story and she is not responsible for the direction. It is not her fault that the supposed fun is based on flames, ice, kicks and tumbles.The idea of this photoplay has been used in films so much that the producers evidently felt they had to add to the excitement of the original. Miss Gaynor, as Marianna Miller, during a more or less thrilling episode is unfortunate enough to lock her crochety employer in the big safe. This means that the Fire Department and the plumbers' union have to be called out. The iron door which looks rather inadequate for the size of the safe, is eventually blown, off its hinges and oxygen is administered to Philip Hancock. And this prompts Marianna to say: \\"I'm afraid Mr. Hancock will be a bit displeased at this.\\"Dexter Wright is a young man with a fiancee on his hands. After seeing Marianna he wishes somebody would run off with the other girl, and in this he is helped out by the villain","excerpt":"but not before the rogue had in some mysterious manner given Dexter some wonderfully potent drops.In one sequence Dexter is unconscious and Marianna is doing her utmost to resuscitate him. A couple of footsteps are heard, and Marianna rolls the insensible Dexter from the sofa to the floor and then under that piece of furniture. She has even to kick Dexter to get him out of sight.Girls looking for a situation, a diligent general manager who smiles upon Marianna, an old reprobate who breaks golf clubs and tries to cheat his colleagues are some of the elements of this production.Glenn Tryon is not particularly well fitted to the part of Dexter.

Who Wants to Be a Libertarian?"},{"year":"1932","title":"HOLLYWOOD has burlesqued itself on several occasions, usually, as far as it is possible to judge from a distance, without very much success. Perhaps the reason therefor is that the outside world is not quite as much interested in Hollywood as Hollywood imagines it to be. Now Elstree, which is prone to slavish imitation of its American prototype, has gone and indulged in a similar pastime and has produced a parody of the films upon which has been bestowed the title of \\"The Innocents of Chicago.\\" It may be suggested that Elstree would have shown better taste, seeing that it had a mind to go burlesquing, had it sought a subject nearer home. It is true enough that some of the gangster pictures with which Hollywood has flooded the world lend themselves easily to the extravagances that are a main feature of the British type of burlesque","excerpt":"but on the other hand it is unnecessary to try and paint the lily and gild refined gold, and Hollywoodian versions of racketeering and bootlegging episodes provided quite that sort of diversion to satisfy the average taste.It is a question with \\"the trade\\" here whether the British public is not already so tired of gangster films that it will refuse to go to a pale imitation of them such as that which Lupino Lane has produced for British International. There is no subtlety in Mr. Lane's work. It is at one moment broad farce, and at another merely a rehash of certain familiar aspects of the ordinary, or rather second class, Hollywood gangster film.A typically fatuous young Englishman, enacted by Harry Kendall, goes to Chicago to take over a business established there by a relative who has mysteriously disappeared. This business is described as the Universal Milk Company, Inc., but in reality is a bootlegging concern in which two rival gangs are operating. The young Englishman's \\"bah joves\\" and general air of imbecility do not justify any expectation that he will avoid being \\"put on the spot\\" or \\"bumped off\\" or \\"taken for a ride\\" by one or other of the gangs with whom he comes into conflict, and his triumphant escape from the plots with which he is surrounded is a strain upon human credulity. Bernard Nedell, an American actor who has made a success on the London stage, invests his rôle of a racketeer with an air of reality; but the majority of the other players, especially the women folk, are so much unlike the types they are supposed to play that it becomes actually painful to watch their persevering efforts to chew gum as to the manner born. Judging by the reception accorded to this production by the audience on an afternoon it was shown to the paying public, Londoners at least derive much more amusement from a real Hollywood gangster \\"thriller\\" than they do from this Elstree attempt to burlesque one.Mr. Herbert Wilcox, a British film director of the front rank, whose fame had been somewhat dimmed by a recent effort of his, has emerged from his partial eclipse with a picture which, despite several weaknesses, has the merit of being very good entertainment. \\"Good Night, Vienna,\\" is a musical comedy, the earlier scenes in which are laid in the Austrian capital of just before the war, when it was the gayest city on the Continent. In the later scenes, which occur after the war, any vestiges of the aftermath during which Vienna has been reduced to its present sad straits are carefully avoided. The play is light-hearted, the settings are gorgeous and captivating, and the music, which has been written by an Englishman of 25, George Posford, has the lilt associated with the names of Straus and Lehar.Mr. Wilcox has done his part extremely well, but it may be questioned whether \\"Good Night, Vienna\\" would have been the success it has turned out to be at the Capitol, where it is drawing full houses daily, had it not been for the engaging personality and ability of Jack Buchanan.It not infrequently happens that British audiences find amusement in American films at times and places where laughter was not the objective sought by the production. A certain tendency to over-emphasis excites a snigger from a sophisticated London audience. There has just been shown here, at the Olympic Theatre, a home-made picture whose reception showed that the Londoner's sense of the ridiculous is not dependent upon considerations of whether it is Hollywood or Elstree that just misses the sublime. \\"In Monastery Garden\\" is a heavy melodrama, directed by Mr. Maurice Elvey, whose experience in film work ought to have been enough to guarantee him from taking a hand in a venture foredoomed to perdition.

The title, of course, suggests the famous multiple views of Mount Fuji and the Tokaido Road by the 19th-century Japanese printmakers Hokusai and Hiroshige - and the same spirit of romantic adventure pervades Mr. Leslie's work. His ''views'' began in 1977 as a series of landscape sketches made - mainly in the Western states - while driving from Pasadena, Calif., to his home in Amherst, Mass. Over the next few years he developed them as watercolors in the studio and this year added some 30 - of scenes around Youngstown, Ohio, and Amherst - to the original body.

The park, at first, was just a vast piece of land purchased by Frederick's father, Friedrich Wilhelm I, as a hunting preserve next to the small garrison town where he had installed his Guard of Giants; then, in 1740, Frederick succeeded to the throne, and development began. First came a vast French-style garden, a few traces of which remain; then the King built a pavilion, Sans Souci (French for \\"carefree\\"), where he could enjoy the privacy he craved. Eventually, he added other buildings, including an art gallery open to the public, a variety of small and charming structures in the park and finally a vast and splendid palace, the Neue Palais.

In fact, Captain Shortwell is always susceptible to a pretty pair of eyes","excerpt":"but one feels thankful that neither he nor Lieutenant Scott tries to embrace the heroine while the Indians' arrows are flying.When Lieutenant Scott reports to the post, he is known to be a \\"fighting son-of-a-gun,\\" but the Captain, like so many of the captains in film stories, wants to show the Lieutenant that he (Ortwell) is the commander. Therefore Ortwell sneers at Scott and says that he \\"will see the heroic Lieutenant Scott later.\\" But later Ortwell is rather glad that Scott was sent to the post.The scenic effects in this feature are particularly good. There are those wherein Indians' tents are like overturned lilies on the grass and clay. The fighting scenes are expertly handled and the Indians and others who take part in these battles do extraordinarily well.Mr. Maynard is good-looking as well as a remarkable horseman.

Charges Rogers and Helen Kane are the other principals. It is a film which elicited a good deal of amusement yesterday afternoon, but the more serious moments are rather out of place.Whether such a story is suited to the screen is problematical, for while it is ably directed and effectively photographed and there is not the least fault to find with the sound recording, the slipping from comedy to melodrama is somewhat distressing.Mr. Rogers does his best in the melody interludes, but while he is a young man of undeniable popularity, his singing is far from inspiring. Miss Kane does well in her comedy scenes and there is a highly laughable sequence aboard the yacht Silver Lady, in which Skippy (Mr. Moore) reveals to Betty Trumbull (Miss Kane) his strange inventions for his galley on the vessel.Mr. Rogers impersonates Jack Mason, an officer in the Coast Guard service, who has odd ideas about duty when he discovers that he is in love. The skipper of the yacht is improving the shining hours as a bootlegger and he takes full advantage of the cover of night and the fact that the owner of the yacht, Mrs. Trumbull, is enjoying her beauty sleep, to carry on his reprehensible activities. An ubiquitous sleuth, however, has his eye on the skipper, Captain Denny, and with the assistance of Mason, Denny's plans are foiled.Skippy's special invention, a lifebuoy with a radio and other comforts calculated to make things agreeable for those who have to cling to it in mid-ocean, comes in quite useful in the end, which was surprising to several persons in the audience who fancied that it possessed so many contraptions that it would sink when it was thrown on the water.Skippy is rather awkward with a pistol, but through Mason's trust in him it falls to his lot to try and cover the miscreants with the weapon when they have been caught red-handed.The last seen of several of the characters is on an island to which they have floated through Skippy's lifebuoy","excerpt":"but one knows that they will be saved, as a destroyer has sighted their signal, and it is to be presumed that Mason and Mary Trumbull are going to live happily ever after.Margaret Breen is attractive as Miss Trumbull.

Somerset Maugham's play, \\"The Land of Promise,\\" which is holding forth at the Paramount Theatre under the title of \\"The Canadian.\\" It is a stirring drama, produced with intelligent restraint and even the light interludes come and go in a natural fashion, actually serving as a relief to this rugged tale of the great Canadian wheat fields.There are no intolerable movie sequences in this picture and the players deliver what is expected of them in this transcript of life in a relatively lonely spot. This production was directed by William Beaudine from an adaptation written by Arthur Stringer. Those who expect to see frowsy-haired blondes arrayed in Fifth Avenue creations or unbridled comic stunts, will be disappointed in this photoplay","excerpt":"but others who have learned what it is to take up life in a dreary place, after having lived in the hustle and bustle of a big city, will appreciate this piece of work. It is a film that is food for thought, and one is willing to condone some of its shortcomings because of what it might have been in the bands of those who think only of \\"jazzing up\\" a good story.Mona Palmer, one of the graduates of the Paramount school, goes through this picture without a smile. And she is right, for the character she impersonates is suddenly thrust into a circle of people whose lives are a startling contrast to the way in which she has been living in England.The climax in this film is perhaps reached a little too early, which makes the story seem slow after the girl. Nora, is reconciled to living as the wife of Frank Taylor, whom she married merely to \\"cook, sew and clean for.\\" Nora had been more or less forced into this loveless union, through friction between her brother's wife, Gertie, and herself. Taylor, who is working for Nora's brother, Edward Marsh, had up to that time been frequently snubbed by Nora. In her dilemma, following an apology she makes to Gertie, Nora suggests to Taylor that he marry her.Taylor is a subdued character, one who goes about his work with a hope that soon be will own land himself. Nora carries out her contract, but one day, when Taylor kisses her, she is furious. He then takes her in his arms and kisses her again. With blazing eyes, Nora steps back to a door, picks up a gun and points it at Taylor. He tells her that she dare not pull the trigger, and, with studied suspense, one perceives the hammer of the weapon snap back and the gun is not loaded. Nevertheless, Taylor is surprised. Later Nora locks herself in a tiny room, but Taylor smashes a panel in the door with his fist.Nora is brought to her senses the following day when she is bound for the railroad station. Without forcing matters, sympathy is created for Taylor, who has the happiness of his wife uppermost is his mind, even when it means sending her back to England.Mr. Meighan is admirable in portraying the man who had himself suffered reverses and was courageous enough to make the best of things. He gives due thought to the situations in which Taylor is endeavoring to conquer Nora's hostile spirit.Wyndham Standing figures as Marsh. He gives a splendid portrayal of the man who had married a woman who would never trouble the contestants at a beauty show, but who was a wonder a cooking, sewing and cleaning. Dale Fuller plays this useful wife's part with no little talent. Charles Winninger makes the most of a sympathetic comedy rôle.The charming Hope Hampton is to be seen in an interesting natural color fashion film. THE SCREEN; A W.

It begins very well, but tapers off toward the end, and a dozing spell at that point does not cause one to lose anything. Alfred Green, the director, appears to have been in a quandary as to what tactics to adopt to strengthen the story, and in spite of everything has failed to hit the target.In the opening scenes Thomas Meighan, who has the part of Kirk Anthony, the idle son of a New York millionaire, is celebrating a football victory in a luxurious dance hall. With him are several other men, all who have figured on the gridiron. The special ballet of the dance place stages a football scrimmage, and soon the young men are in the game, which ends with each one lugging a girl off to a table. For a lark, Anthony tells all the girls to write their telephone numbers and addresses on his shirtfront and cuffs. So when the girls leave, Anthony's shirt is covered with girls' names and addresses. There is a row and a detective is knocked out. A friend of old man Anthony dopes Kirk and sees that he is put aboard a vessel bound that morning for Panama.One has the amusing picture of Kirk Anthony awakening in a stateroom far out at sea with no clothes but those he has on. He attempts to conceal the pencilled names on his shirt, but Mrs. Cortlandt jokes with him about them. Later Anthony persuades one of the officers to lend him a suit of clothes. He meets Mr. Cortlandt (John Mitern), in Panama, who wires to Anthony's father to send his son some funds, and the old man, insistent on the boy making good, denies that he has a son, which causes Kirk to leave the Cortlandt house to search for a job.Mrs. Cortlandt persuades her husband to help Kirk, and Anthony obtains work as a conductor on a train, and works up to a position of importance. Mrs. Cortlandt becomes infatuated with Kirk, but he in turn falls in love with the daughter of a Panama politician.Ramon Alfarez (played by Sid Smith), the immaculate little police chief of Panama, is jealous of Kirk Anthony. Smith acts so well that he easily shares honors with Meighan, and even toward the end it is always a pleasure to see Smith's facial contortions, never overdone, when Anthony trots off with his girl, Chiquita (Lila Lee).Cortlandt is not aware of Anthony's love for Chiquita, and believing that the young man reciprocates his wife's affection, he shoots himself in Anthony's room. The young American is locked up, but eventually, on the discovery of a letter, is released and is last seen returnning home with Chiquita.There are some very good scenes of the Panama Canal, the exteriors of the picture having been made in that locality. Lila Lee is well cast, and Gertrude Astor is pleasing. Meighan, who is always a manly actor, ought to be told to eliminate some of the gestures with his right hand. John Miltern ought to have been able to get more out of his part, but it may be inferred that when he heard that he had to shoot himself he lost heart.
