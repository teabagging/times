Her current exhibition of work on paper at Exit Art in SoHo is the second she has had in New York this fall (the first was at the John Weber Gallery). Her ambitious new video installation, \\"Out of the Corner,\\" at the Whitney Museum of American Art, is based on \\"Cornered,\\" a video that was shown at John Weber in March 1989 and at the New Museum of Contemporary Art last summer.   Ms. Piper is part black and part white. She was born in 1948 in New York City, where she was brought up and entered the art scene in the late 1960's and early 70's. Like some of the most influential Conceptual and Minimal art of that time, her work is absolute, highly logical, structured around ideas whose permutations she exhausts.

Following are excerpts from Caryn James's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 22, 1990. The Chinese-language film opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinema, Broadway at 63d Street.     The most dazzling element in \\"Ju Dou\\" is the everyday work of its characters. In a Chinese village in 1920, a beautiful young woman named Ju Dou is married off to a belligerent older man who owns a factory where fabric is dyed. Though this weighty film is about the sins of the fathers, the oppression of women and passion challenging tradition, cheerful-looking banners of ruby, sapphire and topaz-colored cloth are hung to dry in the open air. They fly in the background as perpetual suggestions of the beauty that exists here only in stolen, illicit moments.

The exasperated composer finally shelved the work. Using a new critical edition of the score, \\"Stiffelio\\" had its very first Metropolitan Opera presentation in October. Taped in November, it can be seen tonight at 8 on PBS as part of \\"The Metropolitan Opera Presents\\" series.    There is a downside. This is not major Verdi, although the work was composed at the beginning of a richly artistic period that would include \\"Rigoletto,\\" \\"Il Trovatore\\" and \\"La Traviata.\\" One insurmountable hurdle is the libretto by Francesco Maria Piave, which is not entirely his fault.

It has been performed in Edinburgh, Washington, Miami, Fort Worth and Minnesota. And now, directed by Colin Graham, who wrote the libretto and encouraged Mr. Paulus to take on the project in the first place, a new production has come to the Boston Lyric Opera, where it can be seen until March 20.   Part of the opera's appeal is its source, James M. Cain's 1934 novel. That book's sharply etched plot and hard-boiled, flat-voiced irony has spawned a small entertainment industry, inspiring at least four filmed versions (two of them American) and a classic French novel (Camus said it was a model for \\"The Stranger\\"). The melodramatic story of a ne'er-do-well drifter, Frank Chambers, who stops in at a roadside diner run by Nick, a good-natured Greek immigrant, and ends up plotting his murder with Cora, Nick's lusty hellcat wife, sizzles with menace, eroticism and brutality.
