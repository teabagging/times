Milo H. Gates, now dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, began at 4 o'clock with the feast of lights in the chapel near by. The Rev. Dr. Frederick S. Fleming read a letter of greeting from Dr. Gates.At the same hour as the chapel service, Dr. Gates was dedicating a memorial tablet to Dr. Moore at the first annual Christmas party in the courtyard of the London Terrace Gardens, Twenty-third Street and Ninth Avenue, on the site in old Chelsea where the famous poem was said to have been written.It was dark when the children with lanterns, followed by parishioners and other residents of the neighborhood, started across Broadway for the cemetery. A huge flare, set up in the centre of the thoroughfare, and the twinkling lights of the children's lanterns brought traffic to a standstill. Lights also gleamed from a huge Christmas tree in the corner of the churchyard.A. A. Hopkins, third vice president of the Dickens Fellowship of New York, participated in the service at the grave of Mr. Dickens, which lies on the top of the hill, overlooking Broadway, and is still unmarked.

The year's first major corporate struggle pits the $309million-a-year nuclear and aerospace company based in New Jersey against the $977-million-a-year Kennecott company in a proxy battle to elect Kennecott's 17&#8208;member board. CurtissWright, with a 9.9 percent stake in the copper company, feels that the $567 million Kennecott spent to acquire the Carborundum Company should rightlyhave been used to directly benefit Kennecott shareholders, and has indicated that if successful, it would sell Carborundum and make the proceeds available to Kennecott stockholders. Kennecott, in defense, has filed suit in New York to block Curtiss Wright's solicitation of proxies, while in Utah, where Kennecott is a major employer, state securities officials won an order temporarily barring Curtiss&#8208;Wright from voting its Kennecott interest at the May 2 annual meeting in New York, soliciting proxies or buying any more Kennecott stock.. .. The dispute between the Navy and the General Dynamics Corporation over the price of nuclear submarines, on the other hand, appeared headed for a settlement. Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff, Democrat of Connecticut, announced that General Dynamics had decided to continue work on the subs, a job that employs almost 14,000 workers, after the Navy agreed to make an immediate provisional cash payment to ameliorate the drag on General Dynamics's fi&#8208;s nances caused by cost overruns.

All's fair in fiction, of course, and what Ms. Grimes has done, apparently, is use her book to air her own grievances, in the tradition of 18th-century satirists who changed their enemies' names and then skewered them in print or, more recently, of Nora Ephron, whose book \\"Heartburn\\" was one big howl of fictional rage against her ex-husband, Carl Bernstein.

Think of these 54 fiercely compressed stories as quicksilver dreams in which a single word or gesture is the exact metaphor for the separation between a man and a woman. Think of these stories as koans, or comments on the human condition to which the only response can be a deeper recognition of isolation. In ''Bottled,'' a woman comes upon a snake as she walks along the beach. ''A cobra here? We are not in a wild place.'' The man she is with traps the snake in a bottle, brings it to their hotel room, lies back to watch it. ''Bottled, alive, the snake slithers","excerpt":"writhing up and down and around its transparent cage. I was wrong, she thinks. This is a wild place.'' In ''Language,'' a woman ''hears the cries of animals. She looks down over a ledge into a small slaughterhouse by the sea below: a bull, a pig, a sheep, wail and hurl themselves against the walls of their pens.'' Three men slaughter the animals, then eat a hearty lunch -butchering is nothing to them.

A movie based on his first book, \\"The Mayor of Castro Street,\\" published in 1982, is about to go into production. An HBO film of his second book, \\"And the Band Played On,\\" just finished shooting. He has a 23-year-old boyfriend (Barry Barbieri), a 10-acre retreat in the country, even a trusty dog (Dashiel).   But Mr. Shilts, 41, who was made famous by his writing on AIDS, has himself developed AIDS, and it is wearing him down.

Nearly 50 years after \\"Gilda\\" was released, images of the swiveling red-headed star still haunt Bob (Per Oscarsson), a retired cameraman who becomes a widower early in \\"Dreaming of Rita,\\" a beguiling Swedish comedy of dreams and memories.    At once grief-stricken and liberated, the tottering old man, who shows signs of serious absent-mindedness, sets off on an obsessive search for a long-lost love he remembers as bearing an uncanny resemblance to the star. The movie, directed by Jon Lindstrom, follows his quest, which takes him from Sweden to Denmark, and concludes in a nearly deserted seaside hotel with a bizarre re-enactment of a scene from \\"Gilda.\\" Accompanying Bob is his beautiful married daughter (Marika Lagercrantz), named Rita (of course), who abandons her husband, Steff (Philip Zanden), and their colicky young baby to be her father's caretaker and chauffeur.    The film, which opens today at the Quad Cinema, is a fluid blend of genres stirred into an amusing, gently surreal meditation on youth and age, memory and Eros, child-rearing and parental responsibility. It is both a road movie and a screwball comedy with mood swings that suggest an odd hybrid of \\"Three Men and a Baby\\" and \\"Wild Strawberries.\\"    \\"Dreaming of Rita\\" has a rich assortment of appealing, quirky characters. Early in the journey, Rita is befriended by Erik, a handsome, footloose young hitchhiker and computer hacker, who falls instantly in love with her. Ultimately she is forced to choose between him and Steff, her stuffy, business-obsessed husband who runs a computer security company and is the closest thing in the film to an unsympathetic character.    When Rita leaves her husband, Steff bribes their daughter Sandra (Yaba Holst) to look after the baby while he pursues his wife. Sandra proves so hostile that Steff is forced to bring the baby with him. After several misadventures in a car that steadily disintegrates, he ends up driving a motorcycle sidecar, still clutching the baby in his arms.    The skillfully plotted movie parallels Rita's having to choose between Erik and Steff with Bob's having had to decide between his wife and his Rita Hayworth lookalike decades ago. At the same time, the movie glibly suggests that the key to living in the moment is by dispensing with much of modern technology. It is only after their cars fall apart and their car phones are ripped out of their dashboards that the characters' spirits lift, and they feel a surge of freedom.    \\"Dreaming of Rita\\" gets progressively zanier as it goes along, and in its frenetic final scenes, its bittersweet undertone dissipates into farce. Pitted against the typical romantic comedy turned out by Hollywood these days, it still wins hands down in charm.

PAPERBACK BEST SELLERS: July 30, 2000"},{"year":"1995","title":"WITH fearless investigative zeal, Paul Verhoeven and Joe Ezsterhas, the director and writer of \\"Basic Instinct,\\" decided to blow the lid off Las Vegas lap dancing and everything it stands for. This quest for truth forced Mr. Verhoeven to watch nearly every big Vegas nightclub show and Mr. Ezsterhas to experience lap dancing on an up-close, personal basis. The research must have been murder. But it was vital if the end product, \\"Showgirls,\\" were to hold a mirror up to society while lucratively turning the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system into a joke.    Unfortunately, the strain of trying to make America's dirtiest big-studio movie has led Mr. Verhoeven and Ms. Ezsterhas to create an instant camp classic. And the surprise is that despite the intense steaminess of \\"Basic Instinct,\\" \\"\\"Showgirls\\" is, in every sense, not so hot. The film makers had declared they were bravely exploring new levels of licentiousness, but the biggest risk they've taken here is in making a nearly $40 million movie without anyone who can act. The absence of both drama and eroticism turns \\"Showgirls\\" into a bare-butted bore.    It's also a demonstration of how coarseness and uninvited laughter can have anti-aphrodisiac effects on even the smuttiest of stories. Mr. Ezsterhas, the Andrew Dice Clay of screenwriting, bludgeons the audience with such tirelessly crude thoughts that when a group of chimps get loose in the showgirls' dressing room and all they do is defecate, the film enjoys a rare moment of good taste. As for laughter, let's just say that Elizabeth Berkley, who stars in this film as a highly principled lap dancer named Nomi, will not be the next Sharon Stone.   With the open-mouthed, vacant-eyed look of an inflatable party doll, Ms. Berkley should have been well suited to a film that treats its heroine like a shiny new toy. But she has trouble even dancing alluringly, in stiffly choreographed production numbers that suggest Michael Jackson videos and Oscar night kitsch, just as she has trouble repeatedly insisting, \\"I am not a whore.\\" As declarations of integrity go, that one appears to rank with \\"I am not a crook.\\" That's because it's easy to miss the fine moral distinctions that \\"Showgirls\\" makes among hookers, lap dancers and G-string-wearing chorus girls. And despite the film makers' claims that this story sends Nomi on a journey of ethical self-discovery, \\"Showgirls\\" sounds too dopey to play like anything but a live-action cartoon.   Of course, not everybody suckered in by the film's heavily hyped nudity will care whether Nomi can become a better human being. Some viewers will simply share the concerns of the man who tells Nomi, about five minutes after she arrives in Las Vegas, \\"Sooner or later you're gonna have to sell it.\\" Not even Nomi's instant friendship with Molly (Gina Ravera), the nice seamstress who invites Nomi to share her mobile home, can protect her from such wolves. When the film makers imagine domestic life between Nomi and Molly, they see chicks in lingerie who giggle, clutch stuffed animals, fuss about manicures and say, \\"What am I going to wear?\\" or, \\"Who ate the chips?\\"   As luck would have it, Molly's needlework chores include repairing G-strings at the Stardust, the nightclub where Nomi catches the eye of Cristal (Gina Gershon), the star who is this film's topless, leering, inarticulate version of Margo Channing.  Nomi would like to be Cristal, since that would allow her to dance before the Stardust's smoldering fake volcano while dressed (barely) in gold lame. Cristal is supposed to resemble a goddess when she does this.   Instead, Nomi is forced to take a sleazier job at a joint called the Cheetah, where Cristal shows up and pays her $500 to dance naked on the lap of Cristal's boyfriend, Zack (Kyle MacLachlan). Cristal watches avidly while Nomi wriggles. Innuendoes abound. By the way, \\"Showgirls\\" includes much less lap dancing or frontal nudity than might be expected, and its graphic scenes concentrate more on voyeurism than on explicit sex.   Indulging in the sort of modular film making that allows story ideas to be mixed and matched, \\"Showgirls\\" comes up with several different men for its ingenue to meet.  Though Nomi appears to have no sexual interest in anyone but Cristal, the men may be helpful as she claws her way up the career ladder. There is Tony (Alan Rachins), a producer so powerful that he enjoys insulting every woman in the Stardust's chorus line. There is Zack, who remains Cristal's coke-snorting plaything but cares enough about Nomi to help her pronounce \\"Versace\\" right.   There is James (Glenn Plummer), the aspiring choreographer who pegs Nomi for a great dancer while she is still at the lap level. James drops the name of Alvin Ailey, denounces Nomi's slumming and says things like: \\"Well, it ain't right! You got too much talent for it to be right!\\" As played decently enough by Mr. Plummer, he is the film's only half-interesting male character, although viewers with the right sense of fun might prefer the film's Very Famous Rock Star. It is he who arranges the gang rape that leads Nomi to her crisis of conscience. Is it really that difficult for rock stars in Las Vegas to make friends?   Or is \\"Showgirls\\" simply filling its quota for the arbitrary luridness, action and extravagance needed to lure audiences around the globe? Mr. Verhoeven, trying to fuse the rawness of his early Dutch films (including \\"Spetters\\" and \\"Keetje Tippel\\") with the slick proficiency of his American hits (\\"Robocop,\\" \\"Total Recall\\"), becomes a man without a country this time. He never gets past the vantage point of an outsider looking in. However familiar he may have become with the world that \\"Showgirls\\" exploits, his film still seems awestruck rather than knowing, and that naivete is too apparent.  Whether spying in the showgirls' dressing rooms or delivering a mother lode of Vegas glitz, its only real objective is inviting the audience to gape.   And gape about everything: when \\"Showgirls\\" finds Nomi in Zack's pool, splashing and thrashing in laughably fake ecstasy, the setting is as meaningful as the sex. Zack's house, car, Champagne and green neon palm trees (really) are as important to this pornographic epiphany as Ms. Berkley herself, who is no less a commodity than anything else on screen.   That scene, like a lot of \\"Showgirls,\\" aspires to the sleek seductiveness of \\"Basic Instinct,\\" the kind that lures the viewers into a world of exoticism and danger. But the enticement is ruined by voyeurism too bare and flagrant to be anything but embarrassing, and by the soul-numbing stupidity that plagues Mr. Eszterhas's dialogue, preventing any character from entertaining two consecutive thoughts in a given scene.   And the sexy, malevolent energy of Mr. Verhoeven's usual directing style is strangely absent here, leaving \\"Showgirls\\" as cold and joyless as it is contrived. Elvis has left the building, in the words of the screenplay's favorite Las Vegas cliche.   \\"Showgirls\\" is rated NC-17 (No one under 17 admitted). It includes wall-to-wall, witlessly obscene language and just enough frontal nudity to justify its strip-club setting. It also includes brief sexual situations, some highly suggestive dancing and much more dancing that awkwardly filters sexual suggestiveness through the prism of modern dance. Costumes are topless and minuscule in many scenes. Probably the extras caught colds.

The Program"},{"year":"1994","title":"As a humorous, lighthearted German film about two wisecracking modern heroines, Katja von Garnier's \\"Making Up!\\" has obvious novelty value that was much admired in its native land. A sleeper hit in Germany, this wry, energetic first feature also travels well, bristling with a funny insouciance that makes sense anywhere.   The awkwardly titled \\"Making Up!\\" (originally titled \\"Abge schminkt!\\") is actually a short, sweet vignette about courtship rituals, with an emphasis on the heroines' Cosmo-girl wiliness about men. Mingling love and work, it begins with a creative crisis for Frenzy (Katja Riemann), a cartoonist who is short on material for her popular character, a foxy little feminine insect.   \\"You try coming up with funny things from your everyday life,\\" she complains. So for inspiration, she borrows the exploits of Maischa (Nina Kronjager), her best friend, who is a flirty nurse. Maischa is the foxier and more predatory of the two, but Frenzy turns out to be the one who finds romantic adventure.   The plot is slender, consisting of little more than Maischa's efforts to land a handsome stranger while foisting one of his friends upon a reluctant Frenzy. But onto this sketchy structure, Ms. von Garnier loads plenty of rueful observations about the dating game. Even though Maischa's boy-crazy outlook, plus some emphasis on cold cream and eyelash curlers, threatens to make the film feel retrograde, the director's attitudes remain enjoyably fresh. Her outlook is also sharply feminine, as when it comes to depicting miserable sex or the maneuvers that go with waiting for the phone to ring.   In a film that runs just under an hour, Ms. von Garnier shows a sure command of her subject matter and a bright comic style. Her film has commercial polish, and it also has two likable performances from its stars. Ms. Kronjager is a particularly promising comic actress, with a game, savvy manner that makes her no man's plaything. Her character's tireless self-involvement is also amusing, as when she studies her handsome dinner companion and muses (in voice-over): \\"Those eyelashes! Two tons of mascara and I can't get mine to look like that.\\"   As the story progresses, it yields a little surprise as Frenzy, not Maischa, winds up lovelorn. And Maischa tries to reassure her. \\"Think of all the work you got done,\\" Maischa says. \\"Feeling bad must be good for you.\\"   \\"You're saying men who aren't around make you creative?\\" Frenzy asks. Not even Maischa is saying that, but \\"Making Up!\\" does have some legitimate wisdom to pass along.   On the same bill is \\"The Coriolis Effect,\\" a 25-minute short about two male friends, which was previously reviewed as part of this year's New Directors/New Films series. At that time, Caryn James, writing in The New York Times, called it \\"a fresh, self-assured film about sexual jealousy, dangerous living and the afterlife, with a nod to 'The Wizard of Oz.' \\" MAKING UP!

These and other surreal tricks are shown off in Dreamworks' funny new insect picture, the first one out of the anthill.     Striving for the clever anthropomorphism of ''Toy Story,'' ''Antz'' recruits above-the-title voice talent to create tiny characters with big personalities. Its shrewd computer animators have great fun seeing the world from an ant's-eye point of view.    However well it works at first, though, ''Antz'' winds up overplotted in bizarrely grandiose ways. Must every child-friendly adventure film boil down to a struggle for world domination? And did this one really need to invoke genocide in its final reel? Surely a threat of bug spray in the picnic basket could have done the trick.    On the bright side, which is substantial enough to make ''Antz'' at least as amusing for adults as for children, Mr. Allen sounds wonderfully invigorated by the chance to play a guy with all those legs -- and all those ant-specific reasons for angst. The film, handily directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson, begins with Mr. Allen's Z in therapy, lying on a leaf in a nutshell as he laments being the middle child in a family of five million. He complains of feeling insignificant, only to be told by his psychologist (Paul Mazursky) that he IS. Mr. Allen's lines, delivered with his sharpest comic timing, sound just like his own writing. (The screenplay is by Todd Alcott, Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz.) He dismisses one group of curly-antennaed ant females by saying: ''They're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.''     One night, breaking away from the crowd in what ''Antz'' pictures wittily as a totalitarian workers' paradise, Z meets Princess Bala (extra imperious, as played by Ms. Stone) at a bar, where they dance a la ''Pulp Fiction'' to suit the film's knowing tone.     But soon after this the ant colony is caught up in a war effort against termites (''Why don't we just try to influence their political process with campaign contributions?'' Z wonders), and the film starts showing signs of a heavier hand. The military leader General Mandible (Gene Hackman) has big dreams that involve sacrificing the little people, to the point where ''Antz'' invokes the Holocaust with jarring abruptness.  The film can't comfortably go from celebrating the bug's-eye glories of a full trash can to expecting nice-guy ant heroes to save the world.    ''Antz'' works best just showing off its prodigious voice talent (Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez and Christopher Walken are also in the cast) and playing lightheartedly with the curious possibilities of a buggy world. Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin fly into the film as Chip and Muffy, behaving like the very WASPiest of wasps, while at another point in the story, spaced-out teen-age ants sit around oh-wowing about whether they're part of a larger world. Ambitiously designed crowd sequences manipulate huge numbers of tiny figures much more fluidly than other recent animated features have done.       ''Antz'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some battlefield violence and tiny double-entendres.

In a Workers' Paradise, This Ant Feels Insignificant"},{"year":"1992","title":"In \\"America's Schools: Pass or Fail?,\\" Tom Brokaw visits three innovative schools that are working to reverse the downward course of American education. In Leadville, Colo., a school known as the Center is open from early morning till after dark, offering educational, health and social services to students and their families. A Philadelphia high school is managing to get more inner-city youths interested in learning. Magnet schools in Los Angeles seem to be giving off sparks.   Mr. Brokaw maintains a respectful yet skeptical attitude as he questions teachers, principals and other educators. The big problem for all the schools, most agree, begins at home, where parents are too busy or ignorant or troubled to give children the sort of start that most had a generation or two ago. Can programs that engage these youngsters also teach them the facts and skills they will need to hold good jobs? Mr. Brokaw predicts change but sensibly resists making any grand promises. Egypt Beyond the Pyramids  TBS Sunday at 9 P.M.    \\"National Geographic Explorer\\" starts its new season with a visit to the Great Pyramids on the Giza Plateau to investigate, with the help of archeologists, the mystery of who built the pyramids. The main news here is that the workers are now believed by some to have been not slaves, but conscripted laborers.    After this dose of scholarship, the host, Robert Urich, relaxes with a report on Lucy, who is described as the world's premier belly dancer. An ancient art, it says here, but Lucy looks thoroughly modern. And the final segment of this undemanding two-hours reports on Thor Heyerdahl's theory that Egyptian merchants crossed the Atlantic to the Americas 2,000 years before Columbus. Then how come the West had to wait so long for belly dancing? The Sunday Talkies   In recognition of the fact that the next two months of Sunday talk shows will be largely devoted to Presidential politics, here are a few tips on how to listen to the language of the partisan guests:   \\"Let's move on.\\" This is a signal that the guest would rather talk about something other than the question asked. Democrats like to move on from the Congressional bank and post-office embarrassments. Republicans prefer to move on from the Administration's policy toward Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait and, in general, from questions about the economy. They will often get away with it by turning abruptly to the next questioner.   \\"Frankly.\\" This word, as used by politicians, invariably precedes a statement that comes right out of their prepared package. From a Republican: \\"Frankly, George Bush has an economic program.\\" From a Democrat: \\"Frankly, Bill Clinton is a family man.\\"    \\"The American people.\\" This phrase is waved each week by representatives of both parties like warriors who have run out of ammunition. Frankly, it signals the moment to hit the remote and move on. The Brokaw Report America's Schools: Pass or Fail?  NBC, tomorrow at 10 P.M. (Channel 4 in New York.)

A14    Lag in Bird Flu Plans  The nation's 5,000 state and local health departments are rushing to make plans for an epidemic of avian flu, but they say they are hobbled by a lack of money and guidance from the federal government.

George Pataki has engineered a $5.5 million reimbursement for suburban rail commuters inconvenienced by the blizzard. If Mr. Pataki wanted to curry favor with mass-transit users, he had ample opportunity when the fares were being raised as part of an ill-advised new five-year borrowing plan. Since he stayed silent then, his latest gesture seems hollow. Worse, it will cost the strapped mass-transit system money it can ill afford.         The reimbursement plan will provide discounts of 15 to 25 percent on an upcoming monthly commuter pass, or a free weekly pass to Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North riders. But it is unclear if commuters who threw away their old  passes will be able to get the benefit. There will be nothing for riders who bought single tickets and then spent hours stranded halfway to work, or for subway passengers on above-ground lines who were forced out of trains before they reached their destination. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority says reimbursing those unhappy riders is too complicated. But that only points out the impracticality of making up to commuters for past bad service.
