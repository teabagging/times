The composition consists of a highly purified carbohydrate called beta glucan, which is a dietary fiber obtained from yeast. Company researchers said it was the active ingredient in oat bran and other fiber-rich foods. There is debate about the effectiveness of foods like oat bran in lowering cholesterol. The company contends that dietary fiber itself could play a useful role.   D. Davidson Easson Jr., executive vice president of Alpha-Beta and one of the product's inventors, said he believed that dietary fiber could help carry both fat and cholesterol out of the body before they were digested. Beta glucan is believed to be the key to that, he said, and it also serves as a supply of short-chain fatty acids, which seem to block production of cholesterol from fat.   In a recent study, the company said, hamsters placed on a high-fat diet and given the new compound reduced their total cholesterol levels by 42 percent. Hamsters that received the same volume of oat bran achieved a 29 percent reduction. Human clinical trials have not taken place.

As the M.A.C.'s reserve funds grow, the need for them diminishes. Covenants require they be no smaller than the M.A.C.'s next annual debt service. But the M.A.C. has been replacing old obligations with new ones with longer maturities and lower debt service.
