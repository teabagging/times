He was 85 and had lived in Sag Harbor, L.I., since 1968.   The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Lelia Katayen.   Mr. Telberg was born of Finnish parents in Moscow in 1910 and was reared in northern China. He earned a bachelor's degree from Wittenberg College in Springfield, Ohio, in 1932, and after pursuing a business career in China, settled in New York City in 1938. A job as a photographer sparked an interest in experimental photography and film and led to study at the Art Students League of New York in the early 1940's.    Around that time, Mr. Telberg began experimenting with the multiple-image photographic technique for which he became known. His photomontages, which sometimes were mural-size, consisted of layered images of figures in motion and had a dreamlike weightlessness associated with Surrealism. He had his first major show at the Brooklyn Museum in 1948. In the mid-1950's he collaborated with Nin, creating images for the 1958 edition of her book \\"The House of Incest.\\"    Works by Mr. Telberg, who also made paintings, sculptures and films, are part of many public collections, including those in the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

Jacobs, a former chairman of New York City's Board of Higher Education and a past president of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan.   He was 81 and lived in Lawrence, L.I.   A successful Brooklyn businessman, Mr. Jabobs held two distinct leadership roles, civic and religious, serving for more than two decades as a member and chairman of the Board of Higher Education and as a spokesman for Jewish orthodoxy in this country.   His final years on the board were marked by the controversy over the board's attempt to fire Dr. Leonard Jeffries as chairman of the black studies department at City College.    Mr. Jacobs was one of four board members who spoke out against Dr. Jeffries and actively sought his ouster because of the professor's anti-Semitic comments. As a result, Mr. Jacobs was one of four board members who were assessed $80,000 in damages in 1994 in a suit filed against the board by Dr. Jeffries in Federal Court in Manhattan. But a Federal appeals court in Manhattan reversed the ruling last month, holding that City College acted within its rights in removing Dr. Jeffries as chairman.   Mr. Jacobs was a lifelong friend of former Mayor Abraham D. Beame, who appointed him to the Board of Higher Education in 1974. Mr. Jacobs was named chairman two years later.   Mr. Jacobs was a strong advocate of charging tuition at the City University of New York, which began in 1975. He also advocated tough financial reforms during the city's fiscal crisis in 1976, and warned he would seek the resignation of the university's Chancellor, Robert J. Kibbee, unless they were implemented.   As head of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, he advocated a strong, pro-Israel American policy in the Middle East and a tight arms embargo against Israel's Arab neighbors.   The son of a prosperous manufacturer, Mr. Jacobs grew up in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, where he became active in Orthodox Jewish affairs.   Despite his family's wealth, he chose to work his way through college, attending St. John's University at night. His strong sense of self-reliance helped explain his support of tuition in the City University.   \\"Anyone who wants to go to college badly enough will find a way,\\" he said in 1976. Mr. Jacobs received a master's degree in economics from Columbia University.   Mr. Jacobs built his own business, Precision Ware, into a profitable kitchenware company. He later headed Precision Equities, an investment company.   Mr. Jacobs also served as president of the National Council of Young Israel and as a member of New York State's advisory council for the Small Business Administration.   Mr. Jacobs's wife, Pearl, died last year.

A3    Iran Rejects Europe's Demand  Iran rejected a call by Europe to halt its nuclear program in two weeks or face possible Security Council penalties, and said it would not give in to what it called bullying.  A3    Egypt to Ignore Poll Monitors  The counry's electoral commission said that it would not abide by a court ruling authorizing non-government organizations to monitor the coming election for president, a decision that effectively placed the commission above the law and called into question the integrity of the vote scheduled to take place on Wednesday.  A4    Egyptian investigators say they have concluded that three recent attacks in the Sinai Peninsula were linked. The assaults included the bombings at Taba in October and Sharm el Sheik in July and a smaller attack in August on peacekeepers in the Sinai.   A4    Schröder Debates Candidate  Germany's conservative leader, Angela Merkel, accused Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of saddling the country with record high unemployment and a faltering economy, as the two met in a televised debate two weeks before an election that most polls predict will make Mrs. Merkel the first female chancellor in German history.  A6    Fox Counters U.S. Criticism  President Vicente Fox responded to criticism from American authorities about a recent surge in violence and illegal immigration along the border, saying that the United States shares responsibility for the problems and should work harder with Mexico to fix them.  A6    Palestine Official Pleads Guilty  A prominent member of the Palestinian Parliament, Husam Khader, pleaded guilty in an Israeli military court to charges of assisting an armed Palestinian faction that has carried out many attacks against Israel, the military said.  A6    Hussein Trial to Start Oct. 19  The trial of Saddam Hussein will begin in six weeks, the Iraqi government said, when he and seven aides face a special tribunal on charges of massacring almost 150 residents from the town of Dujail, the scene of a failed assassination attempt against Mr. Hussein 23 years ago.  A6    Putin Shuffles Navy Command  President Vladimir V. Putin shuffled the Russian Navy's high command, a move expected after the latest submarine accident in August in which seven sailors aboard a mini-submarine were saved with the help of other countries.  A6    NATIONAL  A7-19    New Orleans SearchersAttention to the Dead  Troops patrolled the streets, rescuers hunted for stragglers and New Orleans looked like a wrecked ghost town as the evacuation of the city neared completion and officials turned to the task of collecting bodies in a ghastly landscape awash in possibly thousands of corpses.   A1    As the Bush administration tried to show a more forceful effort to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina, government officials escalated their criticism and sniping over who was to blame for the problems with the initial response.    A1    Strained by an influx of refugees , Texas struggled to house about a quarter-million victims of Hurricane Katrina in shelters and hotel rooms and began organizing an emergency airlift to divert thousands more to other states.    A13    The devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina became a rallying cry for African-American religious and political leaders in Houston, President Bush's former hometown, with pleas for charity mixed with a seething anger at the response to the crisis.   A10    Perhaps not since Richard M. Nixon faced Vietnam-era tumult abroad and at home has an American president had to meet quite the combination of foreign war, domestic tribulations and political division that President Bush now confronts, from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf Coast to Capitol Hill.    A1    New Orleans police officers shot and killed four people and wounded two others who had fired at officers escorting a convoy of contractors across a bridge, the authorities said.   A13    Rehnquist Death Stirs Battle  The death of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist opened a second front in the ideological battle over the Supreme Court, with President Bush saying he would act quickly to replace him. A senior Republican aide said the schedule for the Roberts confirmation hearings, which had been set to begin Tuesday, was expected to be revised.    A1    Advocacy groups on the left and the right scrambled to adjust to what had suddenly become a far more complicated struggle over judicial nominations with the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist.    A19    William H. Rehnquist, who died at the age of 80, almost a year after learning he had thyroid cancer, helped lead a conservative revolution on the Supreme Court during 19 years as chief justice of the United States.   A17    Supreme Court justices say they were as surprised as the rest of the country to learn that the chief justice had died.  A19    Labor Leaders See Opportunity  As they have on past Labor Days, the nation's union leaders are vowing to reverse labor's decline, but that goal is made more difficult this year by the schism in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.    A7    NEW YORK/REGION  B1-5    Candidates CriticizeResponse to Hurricane  Outrage over the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina has worked its way into New York City's mayoral campaign, with the leading Democratic candidates using the crisis as a vehicle for broader assertions that Republicans have neglected the poor. While the candidates were careful not to attack Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's response to the crisis, all four directed sharp rebukes at the Bush administration.    B1    New Strategy in Yonkers  Mayor Philip A. Amicone of Yonkers has recently held several town hall-style forums, urging residents to voice their opinions and ask questions of city officials. The meetings might be rather unremarkable in other places, but in a city where a history of nepotism fuels a sense of frustration and cynicism, the openness is a major shift in strategy and is giving some residents a reason for cautious optimism.

NEW YORK CITY  CITY'S RISING COSTS FOR HEALTH BENEFITS   New York City gives its employees better health benefits than most other cities and states, and could save $600 million by, among other things, making workers and retirees pay part of their insurance fees, a private group concluded in a report. The Citizens Budget Commission said the cost of health insurance for the city's 1.1 million employees, retirees and dependents has become one of the fastest-growing parts of the budget. The city pays $1.5 billion a year, or nearly 5 percent of this year's $31.8 billion budget, in this area","excerpt":"a decade ago, it paid $474 million, only 2.5 percent of the budget. B3. COUPLE ROBBED AND BEATEN IN QUEENS   A liquor store owner and his wife were bound with wire, beaten and threatened at gunpoint but refused to tell two armed robbers the combination to a safe they kept in their modest home in Fresh Meadows, Queens, leaving the men to carry it off Saturday night, the police said. The safe had about $40,000 in cash and jewelry, a police spokesman said. B3. A CALL FOR HELP: REAL OR A HOAX?   The call for help came at 2:46 A.M. A homeless man in a wheelchair, perhaps a double amputee, had been shoved into the Harlem River just under the Triborough Bridge and left to drown. A firefighter plunged into the frigid water and, battling the swift current and the water-soaked weight of his gear, snapped a life belt onto the apparently helpless man and hoisted him to safety. But was everything about this case really as it seemed? The Police Department does not think so. B3. ON THE AVENUE FOR A CLOUDLESS EASTER   On the Avenue, they strolled in and out in the Florentine-gold sunlight like people in a song, sweeping picture brims and straw boaters, chapeaux ribboned and feather-plumed, toques, berets, top hats and Panamas -- a passing parade of creamy-parfait color for spring: lemon-lime, strawberry-orange, cranberry-rose. It was a nearly perfect Easter, a day without brass bands or beery pomp, a day to step into the rotogravure and notice a woman's windblown hair or the geography of an old man's face. The sky was cloudless, as blue as an amateur's painting, and a chilly wind seemed to justify the new spring coat, the white gloves, the face uplifted to a warming sun streaming between the skyscrapers.

Sindlinger thinks you're \\"a damned fool.\\" Mr. Sindlinger, 87, is the pollster who runs Sindlinger & Company, a 39-year-old consumer research outfit in Wallingford, Pa. He talked about the recent stock-market rout, and the outlook from here for stocks, given low liquidity in the average household.   Question: What do you make of the 259-point loss in the Dow over the last two weeks?   Answer: We've seen a decline in people's equity expectations in our polling for four to five weeks. I've been calling for this a long time.   Q: You're known as a real pessimist. Perhaps you've been calling for this too long?   A: I've been talking about this for three years, and this is it. We've had a five-year decline in household income","excerpt":"a decline in the economy that forced  [ interest ]  rates lower; and depressed personal income of investors, who withdrew $608 billion from bank time deposits. Those people chased hoped-for higher yields in stocks and bonds, mostly through mutual funds, and that drove equity prices to new highs. It all fueled personal income with the wealth effect, which forced interest rates to rise.   Q: And the higher rates hurt the market?   A: Yes, but it was part of a structural change. This is not a business cycle. The economy had to come up to the level of the stock market, or the stock market had to come down to the level of the structural change in the economy. The thing that caused current income to rise for six or seven months has been the wealth effect from equities. But if the stock market does what I think it's going to do in the next two to four weeks, rates will start to fall again as you see the destruction of wealth.   Q: Whose wealth?   A: I figure 30 million people have gotten into the market -- bought stocks recently, taking money out of the bank that they shouldn't have taken. And they're going to lose their principal. These are people with $10,000 to $100,000 in assets who used to keep their money in time deposits. But over the last two years, $608 billion has come out of insured time deposits. These people were desperate because their life styles were affected by lower rates. They are mostly in their 60's and 70's, and their life styles were built on the assumption they would always get 8 percent return on their investments. When they found themselves getting 3 percent they were driven into equities almost out of desperation. And they've committed suicide.   Q: How do you expect them to react now? Will they sell and take losses? Do nothing? Buy more?   A: I don't think the public yet has caught on. They think this is the 10 percent correction everyone expected. The poor fools believe it because their brokers told them so.   Q: How low do you expect the Dow to go?   A: 2,000 in the next two to three years.   Q: How do you come by 2,000?   A: That's where the Dow should be to be in tune with the economy and the level of household liquidity. I base it on what people say about current income. Sixty percent say that over the last six months income was down. In a normal recovery it would be 20 percent saying that income was down. In a boom, only 15 percent would say income was down.  Have you noticed that we're supposed to be well into a recovery and everyone keeps talking about \\"when the recovery comes\\"? Normally we'd be worrying about the next recession by now.   Q: Why hasn't the stock market been in tune with how people are doing financially?   A: The stock market was following income until 1985. After September 1985, it ceased to be connected to the economy and became interest-rate driven -- it became a gambling pit. The market particularly in the last year, has solely been interest-rate propelled.   Q: How long do you expect this structural change to take before things settle down?   A: We're five years into it and have at least five more. The market is just catching up to it. It's run out of liquidity. It's run out of these idiots chasing yields. This market has been fueled by idiots.   Q: There's some supposedly smart money placing big bets on the health of the market and the health of small investors. General Electric wants to buy Kemper, for example.   A: G.E. ought to have its head examined.   Q: You're often accused of being perennially pessimistic. When's the last time you were bullish?   A: In 1987. And in 1982 to 1984 I was bullish as hell.   Q: I spoke to the president of Quick & Reilly, the discount brokerage, Thursday night, and he told me that they had two fabulous commission days on Wednesday and Thursday, and that 60 percent of the trades were buys. What do you say to that?   A: That sounds about right. Because the general public has been sold on the idea that there will be a 10 percent correction, and that's the time to buy. I was listening to everyone on television Thursday night saying \\"stay cool because the professional money managers will manage your money well and this is the time to buy on a dip.\\" It sounds good. I wouldn't be surprised to see a rally in the first few days of next week. But that doesn't change the over all, which is that the market is out of tune with the economy, and a lot of naive people will get terribly hurt.

Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence, with Mr. Gates's opening statement and questions by Senators David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, and Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska. The transcript was provided by Reuters and the Federal News Service. OPENING STATEMENT BY MR. GATES    Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, it is a great honor to appear here before you as President Bush's nominee to be Director of Central Intelligence.    I want to thank him for his confidence in me and for the honor of this nomination. I am humbled by it.    I welcome these confirmation hearings to address the many issues that I know you will raise.   Mr. Chairman, here at the outset I want to thank you and the committee for the fair and professional treatment of my nomination. I also want to thank Senators Dole, Kassebaum, Robb and Warner for their kind introductions.    I have been in public service for 25 years. I arrived in Washington 25 years ago this summer with everything I owned in the back of a 1965 Mustang, and no money. The Mustang is long gone, sold before it became a collector's item, and I still have no money.    But I am enriched by a wonderful and patient wife, and two great kids. I believe I still have the idealism that I brought with me from Kansas a quarter century ago","excerpt":"a deep conviction in the greatness of this country, in the uniqueness and wonder of its constitution and in its mission as a force for good in the world.    My decision to commit my life to national service springs from these beliefs.    I also have still the values that I brought with me from Kansas: family, hard work, candor and truthfulness, integrity, obeying the law and a basic optimism about life.    During these 25 years I have worked for six presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike. I served four of them in the National Security Council. I've served eight directors of the C.I.A. I have worked closely and harmoniously with this committee and its House of Representatives counterpart for more than 10 years as C.I.A.'s Deputy Director for Intelligence, chairman of the National Intelligence Council, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, Acting Director of Central Intelligence, and Deputy National Security Adviser.    I have appeared before this committee more than 50 times during that period, so we are not strangers to one another. In short, I do not come before this committee as a new face, but rather, as a nominee with a long track record.    I anticipate that the committee will want to examine both that record as well as my view of the future course of C.I.A. and U.S. intelligence. I think all of the opening statements point to that.   The committees, appropriately, have been looking at the future of U.S. intelligence, its structure and mission in the aftermath of the Cold War, and now most recently, after the revolution in the Soviet Union. Who would have thought that just five years ago we would stand where we are today? Certainly not the intelligence analyst sitting before you.  Talk about humbling experiences.    The old verities that have guided this country's national security policy for 45 years, and thus, its intelligence service, have disappeared in an historical instant. Communism is dead or dying. A number of longstanding regional conflicts are coming to an end. The cold war is over. The Communist Party lies mortally wounded in the Soviet Union, wounded by its own hand. And the forces of real reform are at last ascendant in the Soviet Union.    Still, as ever, there are challenges, concerns and risks. The collapse of the Soviet and Russian empire offers the promise of democracy and economic transformation, but it also contains the seeds of grave instability, chaos and civil war, in a country possessing nearly 30,000 nuclear warheads, the most powerful of which are still aimed at us.    We cannot yet divert our attention from the Soviet Union, but clearly our priorities and our concerns have changed.    Meanwhile, a growing number of nations have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, together with the ballistic missile technologies to deliver them.  Some of our allies in that long cold war are now at times serious adversaries in that global marketplace.    Political instability in the third world spawns conflict, famine and chaos, challenging us politically, economically, sometimes militarily and always morally.    International narcotics cartels not only feed growing global demand, but increasingly have the capability to buy governments and rule countries.    Regional conflict and its terrorist stepchildren, as in the Middle East, remain a reality despite our best efforts.    I have been deeply engaged in dealing with all of these problems. I have been by the President's side when we prevented a coup attempt in the Philippines, liberated Panama, defeated Iraq's aggression against Kuwait, saw the Berlin Wall go down, and led the effort to unify Germany and NATO, fostered the Polish roundtable agreement, completed the C.F.E. and START agreements, and played a role in the success of the democratic forces during the recent Soviet coup attempt.   The President and the Congress know that just as some threats have diminished, other dangers remain or have altered shape, just as new challenges and problems have emerged.    The death of Soviet Communism has vastly diminished the danger of global war, but the world remains a very rough neighborhood. Our nation's leaders, at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, have no wish to walk these streets blindfolded.    We approach the close of the most violent century in man's history. Two world wars, a long and hostile peace punctuated by protracted, bloody regional wars, the destruction of ancient empires and the defeat of two inhuman ideologies -- communism and Nazism -- have set in motion vast political, social and economic forces long frozen by totalitarianism and its legacy.    The path to a new and brighter day is finally apparent but will require still American leadership, strength and vision; the willingness to act against those who would prey on the weak, and skillful navigation around the many obstacles that can thwart progress or send newly free but fragile democracies hurtling back into the darkness.   The role of intelligence is to help the President, his senior advisers and the Congress understand and deal with these changing realities. The challenge, then, to C.I.A. and to U.S. intelligence is to adapt to this changing world, not just in places like the Soviet Union and Europe, but to the very idea of change, the idea that for years to come, change and uncertainty will dominate international life, that the unthinkable, and the not-even-thought-about will be commonplace.    For us in intelligence to adapt to such a changing world will require unprecedentedly close collaboration of the President and his advisers, the intelligence community and the Congress.    If confirmed, I look forward to a close partnership with this committee in this remarkably challenging and stimulating process.   Normally a nominee would be circumspect about specific ideas for change. However, my nomination comes at a time when this committee is deeply engaged in looking at the future of U.S. intelligence, and has, as this morning's statements made apparent, considerable interest in my views about the future and what I would do, if confirmed, to help guide C.I.A. and its sister agencies toward the 21st century.    I believe Director Webster's emphasis on flexibility is central to being responsive in a time of radical change and unpredictability.    What follows are my ideas on where we ought to go from here.    First, this remarkable moment in history affords us a not-to-be-missed opportunity to reassess the role, mission, priorities and structure of American intelligence in the aftermath of the cold war. This should not be done off the cuff.    If confirmed I will recommend that the President launch, with the direct involvement of his most senior security advisers, a major effort to determine the intelligence needs of the United States for the next decade or more, to the year 2005.    He should then in my view charge the D.C.I. to identify what the intelligence community must do to meet those needs. The two intelligence committees should have the opportunity to participate even before these proposals come before the Congress.    At a time of revolutionary change abroad, and Governmentwide fiscal constraints at home, U.S. intelligence cannot remain fundamentally unaffected. Accordingly, we, the executive branch and Congress, must reach agreement on mission and priorities. Once these are determined we can then logically address structure and budget.    Admiral Bob Inman, as deputy D.C.I., managed a similar process for the intelligence buildup during the first half of the 1980's. It is time to follow up that effort with an even bolder, much more far-reaching effort.    This effort ought to be completed by the end of the year, in time to influence the next budget cycle.    There are other problems and innovations that must be addressed as we change to cope with a changing and different world. The intelligence budget should be considered by the President, his senior advisers and the Congress, within, but independently, of the defense budget.    We must dramatically expand our clandestine human intelligence collection effort. At the same time, we must consider the implications for our covert action capabilities of a dramatic decline in Soviet aggressiveness and disruptive activities in the third world.    We must remedy the gap between 21st century collection systems, and a 19th century system for informing policy makers.    We publish too much intelligence of questionable relevance to policy makers. Less and better should be the rule.    C.I.A.'s relationship to and support for the U.S. military must be approved. The process by which the information needs of policy makers are translated into intelligence requirements must be strengthened.    The relationship between our national and tactical intelligence programs must be dramatically improved.    Finally, the intelligence community, and C.I.A. in particular, must build on the openness Director Webster has encouraged to develop better popular understanding and support for U.S. intelligence activities.    President Kennedy once said that C.I.A. successes remain a secret while its failures are trumpeted. However, things have gotten out of hand when the most outrageous allegations against the agency are taken seriously, when the honor and integrity of thousands of patriotic public servants are suspect merely by virtue of where they work.    The C.I.A. and its people deserve better.  But changing perceptions first requires greater openness by the agency.    I can elaborate on these proposals I've just made, and others that I have in mind. But my point is clear: C.I.A. and U.S. intelligence must change, and be seen to change, or confront irrelevance and growing sentiment for their dismantlement.    I look forward to tackling this challenge with you.    Contrary to popular perceptions of an adversary relationship, Congress has long been a strong supporter of a vital and effective U.S. intelligence service. It was the Congressional intelligence committees that launched the rebuilding of U.S. intelligence capabilities in 1979, and their support helped sustain the rebuilding in following years.    This Congressional support not surprisingly is valued in the intelligence community.  But the community also recognizes and values the role of Congress in making intelligence accountable, and in insuring that it operates within the law, and in a manner consistent with American values.    Access to our assessments by Congress -- Republicans, Democrats, liberals, conservatives, moderates -- helps assure our objectivity and independence.    We know that many Americans are uneasy about C.I.A. and U.S. intelligence activities.  They understand the need for information, and even on occasion for covert action, but they are uncomfortable with secrecy. And therein lies the value of Congressional oversight.    The reassurance to Americans that the laws are being obeyed and that there is accountability. This then puts a special responsibility on intelligence agencies to be truthful, straightforward, candid, and forthcoming in dealings with Congress.    For more than 10 years, I have had a strong and positive relationship with this committee. I understand and respect its role and that of its House counterpart as surrogates for both the rest of the Congress and the American people. Consequently, a relationship of trust and confidence between the intelligence community and the two intelligence committees is of vital interest and importance.    Accordingly, I commit to you that should I be confirmed, whatever differences may develop from time to time between the intelligence committees and the executive branch generally, or C.I.A. in particular, I would resign rather than jeopardize that relationship of trust and confidence.    Mr. Chairman, that completes my formally prepared statement. Because of the great interest that this committee has and the centrality of Iran-contra to these proceedings, I wanted to add some additional personal thoughts on this subject at the end, that I wrote down last night.    I've just referred to a commitment about trust and confidence. I don't make that commitment lightly. It is a direct outgrowth of watching the constant crises, primarily over covert action, in C.I.A.-Congressional relations between 1981 and 1986, culminating in Iran-contra.    I suspect few people have reflected more than I have on the Iran-contra affair: what went wrong, why C.I.A. played by rules not of its own making and what might have been done to prevent or at least stop this tragic affair. C.I.A. has already paid a fearful price and learned costly lessons.    But today, I want to speak about the misjudgments I made and the lessons I learned.  First, in retrospect, I should have taken more seriously after the 1st of October, 1986, the possibility of impropriety or even wrongdoing in the Government and pursued this possibility more aggressively. I should have pressed the issue of a possible diversion more strenuously with Director Casey and with Admiral Poindexter. I should have done more.    Instead, I contented myself with taking the information I had received to Casey and Poindexter, as well as to C.I.A.'s general counsel, and then did not follow up after returning from overseas.    Second, I should have been more skeptical about what I was told. I should have asked more questions and I should have been less satisfied with the answers I received, especially from Director Casey.    Third, I should have pressed harder for reversing the provision in the January finding prohibiting informing the Congress.    At the same time, I believe that the actions I did take were well-intentioned and honest.  While differences naturally exist in recalling the details of conversations and meetings at a remove or a distance of months or sometimes even years, the record is clear that I opposed the Iran initiative, I urged notification of Congress, I acted to insure C.I.A.'s compliance with the law. And when for the first time problems were brought to me, I informed Director Casey, consulted C.I.A.'s general counsel and followed the counsel's recommendations.    Even before the Iran initiative became public, I urged full public disclosure. After it became public, I pressed for full disclosure to the Congress. I insured full C.I.A. cooperation with multiple investigations and I began trying to rebuild that relationship of trust and confidence between C.I.A. and the Congress.    Clearly, if I could relive October 1986, perhaps part of November, I would do certain things differently and, I believe, better.  And indeed, my actions as Acting Director for more than five months and as Director Webster's deputy for nearly two years demonstrate that I learned the lessons of Iran-contra. During that period, from December 15th, 1986, to spring of 1989, there was not a single crisis of confidence between C.I.A. and the Congress in stark contrast to the preceding six years.    Nor will there be such a crisis under my stewardship if I am confirmed. You will not find a nominee for Director of Central Intelligence more aware of and sensitive to the lessons of that time or more understanding of the importance of a good faith relationship with the Congress.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  QUESTIONS BY SENATOR BOREN    Q. When you look back on it, could you identify for us those areas where you think you should have been more skeptical and what additional questions do you think that you should have asked that you didn't ask?    A. Mr. Chairman, I think of two examples that I had in mind when I wrote that portion of those remarks. The first was following the lunch on October 9th, 1986, which Director Casey had with Colonel North and which I joined. I have testified before that at the very end of that lunch and at the end of a discussion of the Hasenfus aircraft  [ a cargo plane, shot down by the Nicaraguan rebels eight days earlier; Eugene Hausenfus, a civilian adventurer, survived and was captured ]  . . . I double-checked with Colonel North just to try and cross every \\"t\\" and dot every \\"i\\" that he wasn't aware through his contacts with the private benefactors of any C.I.A. connection. . . . At the very end of the luncheon as I was getting up to leave, Colonel North, as I've referred to before, a comment with respect to a cryptic remark about Swiss bank accounts and the contras. I walked on out of the room and, a few minutes later, went back into Mr. Casey's office and said, \\"You know, that just puzzled me and I wonder if there's something that we should be concerned about there, is there some problem or something we should pursue.\\"   And Mr. Casey basically said -- well, I didn't pick up on what he said, or I didn't catch it and -- \\"There's nothing to it; don't worry about it.\\" And I let it go. And in retrospect, that's the first instance where I believe if I had the opportunity to do it over again I would have pressed him harder and said, \\"Well, now, no, let's think about this,maybe there's a real problem here.\\"    The second example is after the Director and I met with Admiral Poindexter and gave him Mr. Allen's memorandum of 14, October, 1986. . . . Mr. Casey had advised him to have the White House counsel review the entire Iran initiative, make sure everything was O.K. -- much as I had asked our C.I.A. counsel to review it -- and also to think about making it public, that it ought to be made public.   And I should have, at that point, drawn Admiral Poindexter's attention to the specific reference in the Allen memorandum to the possibility that if Mr. Ghorbanifar wasn't paid his money, one of the allegations he might make against the United States was that the money was going to other projects of the United States and the Government of Israel. I did not push him on that.                    . . .         Q. Mr. Kerr testified in late August of 1986 that Charlie Allen came to him with his concerns about a possible diversion, and he testified that Mr. Kerr -- he, Mr. Kerr, then discussed these concerns with you. This could have been at least a month, he said, before Mr. Allen brought his concerns to you on October 1, 1986. Do you have any recollection of Mr. Kerr's discussing the diversion with you prior to your meeting with Charlie Allen when he discussed it with you on October 1, 1986?    A. No, sir, I do not. I think that, in fact, Mr.  Allen has testified that when he briefed me on the 1st of October that I seemed to be surprised and even startled by the information that had been brought to me. Now that's the extent of my personal recollection. . . .    I've never denied that Mr. Kerr may well have broached this subject with me. I've simply said that I have no recollection of it myself. . . . I've testified several times that throughout the preceding year or so, we had heard rumors about funding, where the contras were getting their funding. We had heard rumors about contributions or donations from foreign countries, from the private benefactors and so on.                    . . .         Q. Did you hear any rumor or did you become aware of any rumor prior to Mr. Allen's conversation with you on October 1st about the diversion of arms sales to the contras?    A. My memory of this from the very beginning is that the first I heard was from Mr. Allen. . . .   Q. . . . It now appears, however, that at least one other senior C.I.A. official, Alan Fiers, the head of the Central American Task Force, had direct knowledge of the diversion before October 1, 1986. . . . He told Clair George  [ the Deputy Director for Operations ]  and the chief of the Latin American division by sometime late August 1986. . . . Did the chief of the Latin American division during this period of time prior to October 1, 1986, or prior to the public disclosure of the diversion, did the chief of the Latin American division ever come to you and tell you about the diversion?    A. He did not.                    . . .         Q. Did Mr. Clair George ever tell you about the diversion of funds to the contras?    A. He did not.                    . . .       QUESTIONS BY SENATOR MURKOWSKI    Q. Well, I'd like to address Mr. Casey's management style as a Director of Central Intelligence, because I think it's appropriate. . . . Can you explain for me just basically how the agency operated under the structure as dictated by the director, Mr. Casey, as opposed to the organizational chart which clearly shows a structure that one would assume would be a normal reporting structure?    A. . . . I think that the first thing in terms of Mr. Casey's personal style is that this is a man who had begun his intelligence career as an O.S.S. officer in Europe. It was a time when, needless to say, there was no oversight, and even management, I think historians would agree, was fairly slack.    He then made his career essentially as an operator -- as a lawyer operating on his own, and as an author. In essence, he never worked -- or he did not work through much of his career in a bureaucratic structure, although he had several senior Government positions in the State Department and the S.E.C. . . . Actually for the first several years, it was something of an adventure to work for him, because he would pick up the phone and punch a button without much concern for who was at the other end of the line and start shouting instructions. . . .   He also would fail to change the buttons when he'd call again. So he'd call and then about 30 seconds later he'd call again and you'd say, \\"Yes?\\" and he'd say, \\"Who's this?\\" and you'd say, \\"Well, this is Bob, and you just talked to me.\\" And he'd say, \\"Oh, I didn't want you\\" and then he'd hang up. . . .    I don't think he would have recognized the C.I.A. organization chart the first several years he was there, if a lot depended on it. . . .    I believe that when Mr. Casey came to C.I.A. he came with the view that he in essence would involve himself very deeply in operational affairs. I won't say that he intended to run the clandestine service because he wasn't organized enough to do that, but rather to involve himself very deeply in its affairs. . . .   Nowhere was this more true than on those issues that were a special passion for him, like Central America. And where he would reach down into the organization and basically ignore all of the bureaucratic aspects. . . .

Old Colonial Roads"},{"year":"1924","title":"That wonderful ecstatic laughter, tinkling and beautiful, just the laughter that Barrie loves to hear, greeted Herbert Brenon's picturized version of \\"Peter Pan\\" yesterday afternoon in the Rivoli. Again and again the silence of the audience was snapped by the ringing laugh of a single boy which was quickly followed by an outburst from dozens of others, some of whom shook in their seats in sheer Joy at what they saw upon the screen. It was laughter that reminded one of the days of long ago when one believed in a sort of Never Never Land, when the smiling sun on an early morning made one dance with joy over the dew-covered grass, when the fragrant Spring flowers sent a thrill through one's youthful soul, when one gazed at a real fish in a shallow rippling stream and expected to hook it with a bent pin, when one thought that after all it might be possible to fly.These jubilant outbursts from youthful throats even brought to mind some beautiful anthem one had heard the choir singing in a lofty cathedral. It was laughter that brought a tear of exuberant gladness to our eyes—laughter that makes grown-ups delighted to be alive.To our right was a mother reading the titles to her tiny son, who was so excited that he only rested against the edge of his seat for fear that the two women in front of him might lean their heads so that he might miss a fragment of the entertainment. He was enraptured, and evidently his mother ceased for a while to explain the captions, as she, too, was engrossed in the story. There were numerous Mr. and Mrs. Darlings in the theatre and often the alto laughter of the young was almost drowned by the merriment of rugged baritones mingled with the bell-toned sopranos. Anybody who had a boy or a girl, or both, was doubly entertained by this charming fantasy, especially when Peter Pan teaches Wendy, Michael and John Darling to fly. The joy of the boys and girls was boundless when John and Michael failed to soar through the air and plunged on their beds. Later the little ones were filled with awe when Michael, after concentrating with a frown on good thoughts, suddenly flew clean across the room and alighted on the mantelpiece.The young onlookers were ??? with amazement when Peter and the Darling children flew around and around the bedroom, and then out of the window on their way to the Never Never Land.To many of the boys and girls. Nana was a real dog, awkward but sympathetic and rather clever. They enjoyed seeing Nana give Michael his medicine and they were aghast when Mr. Darling in the most cowardly way poured his nasty medicine into the faithful Nana's bowl. And great was the chagrin in many youthful souls when Nana was taken outside in the cold.Obviously inspired by his discussions with Sir James Barrie, Mr. Brenon has fashioned a brilliant and entrancing production of this fantasy, one which is a great credit to the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation and also to the whole motion picture industry. It is not a movie, but a pictorial masterpiece which we venture to say will meet the approval of the author. While he has introduced some ideas which were not possible on the stage???, Mr. Brenon has not strayed from the theme of the whimsical story. In the Never Never Land mermaids are seen by the sun-lit sea and when the redoubtable Captain Hook has captured the children, these mermaids swim forth to find the crocodile that causes the pirate to quake with terror. The scene of the mermaids is effective and beautiful.Betty Bronson is a graceful, vivacious and alert Peter Pan. She is youth and joy, and one appreciates that she revels in the rôle. Her large eyes are wide with wonder when she first greets Wendy and she is lithe, erect and straight of limb when she fearlessly fights the horrible Captain Hook on his pirate craft. In most of the scenes her hair seems to have a natural boyish curl, but in one close-up, which might be eliminated, one was strongly reminded of a marcel wave. She is a Peter Pan to delight the children and entertain the adults.Captain Hook is impersonated by Ernest Torrence, who is as effective as he can be as a gruff pirate whose voice is not heard. However???, to make up for the loss of Hook's deep, challenging tones, the pirate has a real ship floating on glistening waters. The fight between the children and the pirates, a source of delight to the small boys, takes place aboard the ship that flies the skull and crossbones. In the film Captain Hook throws the alarm clock to the crocodile, so that he will ever be warned of its approach by the tick-tocking. The brave Peter of the picture relieves the crocodile of the clock so that it can steal upon the unsuspecting Hook and \\"get the rest of him.\\"One sees Tinker Bell as a light and also as a tiny, tiny fairy, which is cleverly pictured through double exposure. Cyril Chadwick plays the part of Mr. Darling and, excent that he is too quick in his movements in his moments of irritation, he is quite good.There are some lines we would like to have seen in the captions, but most of the important phrases have been used. In some of the text the title writer has employed some combinations of words that are hardly Barriesque.Esther Ralston is comely as Mrs. Darling, whose mouth is \\"full of thimbles.\\" Mary Brian makes a charming Wendy, and Philippe de Lacey and Jack Murphy are effective in their respective r???òles of Michael and John.George Ali figures under the covering of Nana, and he makes the \\"dog\\" give an admirable performance. The appealing look that comes to Nana's eyes, the \\"nurse's\\" devotion and bewilderment are quite fascinating.Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld has prefaced this production with a colorful prologue. The same picture is also on view at the Rialto. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A Delightful Picture."},{"year":"1985","title":"THE ILLUSTRATED ZULEIKA DOBSON. Or an Oxford Love Story. By Max Beerbohm.

For it is hard to imagine a picture with less promise commercially. In a little over an hour, it exhibits most of the baser shortcomings of men—cruelty, blood-lust, ruffianism, pusillanimity and sordid pride. It shows a tragic violation of justice with little backlash to sweeten the bitter draught. And it puts a popular actor, Henry Fonda, in a very dubious light. But it also points a moral, bluntly and unremittingly, to show the horror of mob rule. And it has the virtue of uncompromising truth.The story is really no more than a single episode—an incident, as the title says—which is supposed to have occurred in Nevada back in 1885. But it might have happened any place, for that matter, and at almost any time. A rancher is reportedly killed by cattle-rustlers and a mob gathers to seek revenge. Rancour, lust and curiosity fan a reckless fire. A deputy sheriff swears a posse","excerpt":"a demagogue takes command. And the self-assumed guardians of justice go tearing off into the hills to do their will. In the dark of night, they capture three men who are driving a herd. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, they assume these three are their prey. And, in a lather of hot brutality which takes no heed of the signs of innocence—nor of the valiant but do-nothing protests of a handful of clear-thinking men—the mob pulls a triplet lynching. When it is over, they learn that the \\"murdered\\" man still lives.William Wellman has directed the picture with a realism that is as sharp and cold as a knife from a script by Lamar Trotti which is beautifully brief with situations and words. And an all-round excellent cast has played the film brilliantly. The manner in which Mr. Wellman has studied his characters is a lesson in close-up art. And the terror which he has packed into that night \\"trial,\\" with the ruthless lynchers glowering around a mountain fire while the doomed men face their fate in pitiful misery, is drama at its cruel and cynical best.A heart-wringing performance by Dana Andrews as the stunned and helpless leader of the doomed trio does much to make the picture a profoundly distressing tragedy, while Frank Conroy's performance of the demagogue (all rigged out in a Confederate officer's uniform) imparts to it a perceptive significance which is good to keep in mind. Mr. Fonda is cryptic and bitter as one of the stancher holdouts for justice, while Harry Davenport and Leigh Whipper are more affecting emotionally as champions of the right. Mary Beth Hughes has been pulled in for one brief, ironic scene with Mr. Fonda which gives a justification for his mood. And the rest of the cast can take bows for small but impressive roles.\\"The Ox-Bow Incident\\" is not a picture which will brighten or cheer your day.

This latest film from the expert who made \\"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,\\" \\"The Arab,\\" \\"Scaramouche,\\" \\"Mare Nostrum\\" and other memorable shadow achievements is a subject of rare beauty with enchanting scenes under Algerian skies and some excellent Arabian studies. Unfortunately, however, Mr. Ingram appears to have centred his eyes on his individual episodes with insufficient attention to the dramatic values of his narrative. Therefore, it is a beautiful picture that is not always interesting because the continuity is often abrupt. Mr. Ingram has meddled with comedy that is so obviously manufactured for the purpose of relief that it even fails in its intent. It would have been far better had the producer kept closer to his story and resisted the temptation to include these grotesque notions.For several years it has been the opinion in motion picture circles that the man who received the opportunity of filming \\"The Garden of Allah\\" would have the chance of a lifetime, especially if he were permitted to make it on its original locale. But the effect of the many desert romances that have preceded it have undoubtedly made Mr. Ingram's task a very difficult one. He evidently wanted to produce a picture strongly flavored with the native atmosphere, and in this he has been moderately successful.While Alice Terry is gracious and lovely, it is questionable whether she is really the popular conception of Domini Enfilden. She strikes one sometimes as being extremely conscious of her personal appearance, especially when she pulls a cloak over her well-marcelled blond hair. She is a passive type and appears to be out of her sphere as a woman who would fall in love as suddenly as Domini does in this case.There is more real character to Ivan Petrovich's portrayal of the Trappistan monk, Father Adrien, who is later known as Boris Androvsky. Prior to the monk's forsaking the monastery and his robes there are a number of scenes that are well pictured, especially those in which Count Anteoni comes to the monastry and is introduced to the man of silence and godliness who is the supervisor of the making of the Trappistan liqueur.Mr. Ingram's scenes of a desert caravan are most compelling. One sees it as a thin line groping its way over the sun-scorched sands and then comes a closer view wherein the faces of the persons are depicted. This director also shows his artistic touch in the crowd scenes, in the \\"shots\\" of Biskra and in those of the gardens. But his sandstorm is not as mighty as might have been expected, and the glimpse of Boris coming to the tent when he was supposed to have been lost appears to be extremely fortunate and rather sudden.Mr. Ingram has been working on this picture in Algeria and in the South of France for more than six months. With the exception of Miss Terry, who in private life is Mrs. Ingram, the cast is an European one, and Mr. Ingram is to be congratulated on the performances he has elicited for all.\\"The Garden of Allah\\" is a picture which one regretfully finds to be a series of scenes which in themselves are pleasing to the eye, but which do not often engender much in the way of suspense or drama, except in individual episodes. And the characters, with the exception of Boris, arc lacking in vitality.

BROTHER OF YALE'S HEAD Resigned From Federal Bench, to Which Taft Appointed Him, to Resume Law Practice."},{"year":"1992","title":"The double-barreled Midwestern showdown put Bill Clinton in the fast lane toward the Democratic Presidential nomination today and left Paul E. Tsongas and Edmund G. Brown Jr. to squabble over which one could better pick up the pieces if Mr. Clinton should crash.   Unless he spins out of the race, it will be hard to deny Mr. Clinton the rest of the delegates he needs, because the proportional system awards large blocks of votes to both winners and runners-up. It will be all but impossible to overtake him if he can keep putting together broad biracial coalitions like the ones that swept him to victory last week and this, in the Sun Belt and Rust Belt alike.   New York's Democratic primary on April 7 now takes on fresh meaning. After Mr. Clinton's triumphs by thumping margins in both Michigan and Illinois, it may offer the last chance for his challengers to stop him.   \\"It's almost a done deal,\\" said John Marino, the New York Democratic chairman, who often expresses the viewpoint of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.   The nagging questions about Mr. Clinton's personal life, most recently his financial affairs and those of his wife, Hillary, probably represent a larger threat to the Arkansas Governor's progress than rival candidates do. They are trying to convince people that he is not electable, and in the meantime they are staying in the contest in the hope that some new revelation will bring him down. Hoping for a Stumble    \\"Every morning Bill Clinton gets out of bed,\\" said a senior figure in the Tsongas campaign, \\"he faces the possibility of some media disaster unfolding that day. We would be fools to get out at this point. You stay in, you soldier on, you try to remain a constructive alternative, so if . . . \\"   President Bush held Patrick J. Buchanan to only a quarter of the vote in Illinois and Michigan as the Republican protest continued to fade. Mr. Buchanan's purse is almost empty, to judge from his small-scale television campaign in Michigan, and he now plans to cut back his campaign, bypassing most tests to concentrate on the June 2 California primary. He hopes he can lay the groundwork there for a conservative crusade in 1996.   That approach amounts to a concession that the President is going to be nominated again and clears the way for Mr. Bush to be more Presidential.  He spent Election Day in Clinton-land, traveling to Bentonville, Ark., to present a medal to Sam Walton, the retailing wizard, and talking about the American dream instead of chasing votes.   Next Friday, the deadline Mr. Bush has set for Congressional approval of his economic package, will pass, giving him the opportunity to redefine himself as the implacable foe of a do-nothing opposition Congress, a role that won President Harry S. Truman a lot of votes in 1948.   But Mr. Bush still has plenty of problems. In Illinois, a state that has gone with the winner in nine of the last 10 Presidential elections, a Chicago Tribune poll last week showed Mr. Clinton beating him, and Mr. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator, tying him.  It indicates that only a third of the electorate thinks he can solve the nation's economic problems.   There were also strong rumblings of anti-incumbent feelings in Illinois, and they cannot have cheered the President much. Senator Alan J. Dixon and Representative Gus Savage were beaten, while Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the hitherto untouchable chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, had to resort to heavy advertising for the first time in his career to pull out a victory.    A lot will change between now and November, of course. But in swing states like this, Mr. Bush must find a way to convince people that he is not an economic klutz. He needs most desperately to find the formula among the blue-collar voters of various Eastern European ethnic groups who for the last five or six elections have backed Republicans for President.   In Michigan, where there are large numbers of such \\"Reagan Democrats,\\" he has a very long way to go","excerpt":"a Detroit News poll last week found that 94 percent of Democrats, an unheard-of majority, had lost faith in his economic stewardship. The task may well be beyond Mr. Bush or any President.  Many of the jobs lost in the recession that has devastated the American automobile industry have probably been lost forever, which is a politically unspeakable truth. Credibility for Brown    That kind of weakness in an incumbent makes Democratic politicians keen for the hunt. In normal circumstances, they would be closing ranks around Mr. Clinton, judging him a big winner after his 10 victories in two weeks. But they are not; they are worrying about Mr. Clinton's vulnerability in the general election, a vulnerability that encourages the claims of the also-rans.   For the moment, Mr. Brown has the better of the argument, in terms of credibility if not delegates, in which he trails Mr. Tsongas. The former California Governor's advantage results from his strong second-place finish in Michigan, an economically devastated industrial state where he demonstrated strong appeal to union members and ethnic voters.   It was by far his best showing in a major contested primary.   Mr. Brown plans to take his low-cost insurgent campaign to all the remaining industrial states, and his fund-raising has improved to the point where he was able, for the first time this year, to run a television commercial in Michigan. He is building toward the California primary, but he is also talking about putting together a permanent reform movement. Dismaying for Tsongas    A third-party candidacy cannot be ruled out, in the view of some Democrats who have watched Mr. Brown turn himself almost overnight into a populist evangelist denouncing big business, free trade, high taxes and the kind of opulently financed campaigns that he once specialized in.   Mr. Tsongas finished second in Illinois. Mr. Brown made little effort here, but Mr. Tsongas apparently still failed utterly to sell himself to any significant number of blacks or blue-collar whites.   The actual figures in polls of voters leaving the booths today were dismaying for the Tsongas camp. In Illinois and Michigan, only about 1 black voter in 10 backed Mr. Tsongas. Likewise with blue-collar voters; Mr. Tsongas won only 1 in 10 in Michigan, only 2 in 10 in Illinois.   Granting the former Senator's strength among independents, well-educated technocrats and suburbanites -- all of whom are important in building an eventual majority coalition -- it is hard to see how he can win in November, if nominated, unless he can greatly broaden his appeal. Eyes Toward New England    But Connecticut, back in Mr. Tsongas's native New England, is the next primary test, followed by Vermont a week later and New York (plus Wisconsin and Kansas) a week after that.  The former Massachusetts Senator has enough money to carry on that long, aides say, and try to restart his effort by reaching out to less well-off voters.   Ted van Dyk, who has signed on as an adviser to Mr. Tsongas in the last few days, conceded that a failure in New York would dry up the flow of dollars quickly. Still, said Mr. van Dyk, a longtime political strategist, \\"It will take Bill months to get an absolute majority of delegates, and there's at least a 50-50 chance, in my mind, that he'll be blown out of the water before he accomplishes that.\\"   Many members of the Democratic establishment welcome Mr. Tsongas's determination to persevere, and some welcome Mr. Brown's searing attacks on Mr. Clinton.   But Jody Powell, who was President Jimmy Carter's press secretary and helped plan the strategy of his two Presidential races, said the party would be \\"much better off getting things settled early,\\" so it could turn its attention to President Bush.   Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, himself a candidate for President four years ago, urged party leaders tonight to fall in behind Mr. Clinton.

Or did it die out long ago, with Mahler, Sibelius and/or Shostakovich? Alas, this topic is even more tiresome. The symphony has been a malleable and futuristic form all along, re-invented by every composer who seriously addressed it. In the hands of contemporary composers as diverse as Robert Simpson, Witold Lutoslawski, Alfred Schnittke and Per Norgard, it remains a vibrant organism, resisting musicological autopsies and epitaphs.    Signs of life could be clearly read in the Symphony No. 11 of David Diamond, given its world premiere Thursday night by the New York Philharmonic under Kurt Masur. This flawed but intensely ambitious work sprawls across three-quarters of an hour, defying a public that prefers to digest new music in 20-minute morsels. In the best tradition of Schubert and Bruckner, the structure is capped with a finale that throws out a superfluity of themes and goes on way too long. Mr. Diamond's familiar acerbic harmonies and terse lyricism hold sway, giving the piece a somewhat antique sound throughout. But the confidence and conviction of the voice are unmistakable and, in the end, rather impressive.

I can take it a step further.\\"   That's a musician's reflex, shared by hip-hoppers who grab a favorite riff and by classical composers who think they can enhance the ephemeral products of popular culture. Centuries ago, when medieval church composers used folk tunes as the foundations for Masses, the compositions not only stood on their own merits but also helped preserve unwritten melodies. In the era of recording, however, brutal comparisons are possible between not-so-naive popular works and supposedly sophisticated classical spinoffs.

The NATO operation had triggered an all-out attack by the Serbian military on the civilian population, and thousands of ethnic Albanians were thought to have been killed. My assignment was to write about the F.B.I. pathologists who were sent over to gather evidence for war crimes trials at The Hague. I'd been in Balkan wars before -- five months in Bosnia and Croatia, then in Kosovo after the first massacres in the spring of 1998 -- and my disgust with the Serbian government was in full bloom. I knew, intellectually, that the Serbian people had suffered as well -- at the hands of opposing armies as well as at the hands of their own government -- but that did little to blunt my feelings. Kosovo in the spring of 1999 was as close to black-and-white as it gets with journalism, and I was eager to go there and document proof of my own beliefs.    Almost immediately, though, things got murky. On a sweltering day in late June, less than a week after NATO troops first poured across the border, I found myself sitting in a car with several other journalists watching a pig die. Muslims don't eat pork, Serbs do, and this pig had obviously been left behind by a Serbian farmer who fled in the wake of the cease-fire. Two Albanian boys were throwing stones at the pig, and it was staggering around in confusion under the hot sun. It finally collapsed in a ditch, and the boys set upon it with clubs.

The guests of \\"Half-Way House\\" are a fairly representative cross-section of humanity, and they are afforded the unique experience of observing the circumstances under which they might have perished in a Nazi bombing raid had not a beneficient Providence permitted them another chance to adjust their ways of life.Call \\"Half-Way House\\" a morality film, if you will, but it certainly is not obtrusively \\"preachy.\\" And the lesson it subtly teaches about human kindness and understanding is one we might all profitably dwell on more often. The script, written by Angus McPhail and Diana Morgan, is not without touches of slight humor, and the actors are all quite human and natural. However, Françoise Rosay dominates the story as the bereaved mother and wife of a disgraced sea captain who morbidly tries to communicate with the spirit of her son, drowned at sea in the war. This is the French cinema star's first English-speaking picture, and her command of the language is remarkably good.\\"Half-Way House\\" is reminiscent of \\"The Passing of the Third Floor Back\\" and \\"Outward Bound\\" in that its motivating characters (an innkeeper and his daughter who perished when their hostel burned a year before) wield a mysterious influence for good over their guests. These are an assorted lot who have strayed from the path of righteousness and, though they're not fully aware of it, want to atone for their mistakes. They include a couple, with a child, on the verge of divorce","excerpt":"a discharged army officer just released from a term in prison for tampering with the regimental funds; a war profiteer who feels his luck is running out; a celebrated orchestra conductor fighting against a bad heart, and a second young couple whose marriage is threatened by strongly opposed views over Ireland's neutrality.Technically \\"Half-Way House\\" does not measure up to customary standards. The photoplay is grainy and at times the faces of the players have that washed-out quality which stems from improper lighting, but these imperfections did not strike this corner as too important. In fact, they serve to enhance the rough honesty of purpose that went into the making of \\"Half-Way House.\\" THE SCREEN; 'Half-Way House,' British Importation that Teaches of Human Kindness, Opens at the Little Carnegie"},{"year":"1931","title":"Called a disciple of Calvin FOOTNOTES ON A WEEK'S HEADLINERS","excerpt":"A Disciple of Calvin.

Pasta con le sarde plays the soft texture and saline flavor of Mediterranean sardines against the slightly bitter and musty taste of wild green fennel from the Sicilian mountains. The play is further enhanced by the addition of sweet dried grapes from the lowland orchards, pine nuts from the forests, a little saffron (a touch of Moorish Spain), all combined with fine Sicilian olive oil, then presented to the diner against the soothing backdrop of a pasta.   All of Sicily is present in this dish, which dates back to the time of the Arabs. As described by Tommaso d'Alba in his ''La Cucina Siciliana di Derivazione Araba,'' the Arab General Eufemio, having conquered Sicily and wanting to appease the hunger of his troops, ordered his cooks to put together the best of what the island offered and then to add a little Arab fantasy - the pine nuts and saffron.   Green as pesto but a little bit more lumpy, this mysterious-tasting sauce doesn't quite cling to pasta.

It is a ballet for those who wait breathlessly for the \\"Rose Adagio\\" balances in \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\" or the 32 fouettes in \\"Swan Lake.\\" But a cast of three new leads in \\"Etudes,\\" presented by American Ballet Theater on Wednesday afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera House, brought a warmth and luster to the dance.    One expects technical expertise and sensitivity to style from Susan Jaffe and she delivered it here. The soft curve of her body and, in particular, the angling of her head and shoulders in the ballet's white section recalled that this is a work by a choreographer schooled in the Danish style. And Ms. Jaffe's sunny radiance and authority lent an extra measure of graciousness to the ballerina role. Charles Askegard's long legs and feet did astonishing things to his beats, in a role debut as the Danish cavalier. Mr. Askegard also stood out for the elegant lyricism of his arms, an ebullient attack and partnering that was as exquisitely attuned as ever to his ballerina.

This production will be on exhibition at the Paramount beginning tomorrow.\\"Sarah and Son\\" is an intelligently directed narrative of a young mother whose infant son is given to the care of a wealthy family by her ne'er-do-well husband. This unfortunate woman, Sarah Storm, does not know where Jim, her husband, took the child, and Jim himself has disappeared. Some time later when she is singing to war wounded in a hospital she sees Jim, who dies just after uttering the name of \\"Ashmore.\\"In these initial scenes the agony is piled on a little heavily, but the excellent acting of all concerned saves these episodes from being tedious. Later, after Sarah has studied grand opera singing in Europe and she comes to this city to sing in the Metropolitan, the story is graphic and affecting. There are several tense scenes in which a foster mother stoops to cheating Sarah so that she can keep the boy, Bobby, whom Sarah has not seen since he was an infant.At the outset Miss Chatterton, as Sarah, speaks with an Austrian accent. This pathetic mother, who is then striving to make a living in vaudeville with the worthless Jim, hails from Vienna. Miss Chatterton sustains this broken English for some of the scenes, and in the later passages she cleverly contrives to make Sarah's English improve. This is quite a remarkable feat, especially before the microphone, with constantly changing scenes spread over a period of six weeks or two months.The coincidences are conceived in a fashion that enhances the story.Sarah as a poor woman is threatened with incarceration in an insane asylum if she annoys Mr. and Mrs. John Ashmore about the child. They persist, even to their lawyer, Howard Vanning, that Bobby is their own son. Sarah is not permitted to see the boy, although she insists that she can tell whether he is her child by a birthmark.Vanning is sympathetic with Sarah, but he believes that she is mistaken. There is a charming scene where Sarah in telling Vanning about her operatic rôles does so with genuine and pleasing conceit, an idea that amuses her.It is when Mrs. Ashmore realizes that her new servant is the mother of a boy about Bobby's age—a deaf mute—that she is impelled to send this youngster to Sarah. The scene that follows is much too long, for one expects Sarah to look on the back of the boy's neck for the birthmark some time before she does. In the end she decides that he is not her son after all.The closing scenes with Bobby meeting his mother by accident and she not knowing that the young runaway is her son, are most compelling.Dorothy Arzner, who recently has been producing films with Robert Milton and alternating in the credit for them, is set forth as the director of this production. Every performance is restrained. The late Fuller Mellish Jr. is seen in the rôle of Jim. It is a good performance. Frederic March is easy-going and natural as the handsome la yer who is in love with Sarah and who is addressed by her until the last few episodes as \\"Mr. Howard Vanning.\\" Another player who contribute","excerpt":"a distinguished performance is Gilbert Emery, who acts Ashmore. He has a pleasing diction and an agreeable manner. Doris Lloyd also rises to the occasion in her interpretation of Mrs. Ashmore.Young Phillippe de Lacy impersonates Bobby during the important stages of this chronicle. He is well suited to the part, but it might possibly have been better had he not been called upon to weep, because he is deprived of enjoying himself at games and sports. He is at his best during the stretch in which he runs away to his uncle's home.A little less attention to pathos and a little more attention to cheer would have made this even a better film than it is.

Stephen Keep Mills has directed his own script, and Kinny Landrum will play the score that he arranged from traditional holiday music.    Mr. Mills, who has a master's degree from the Yale School of Drama, is an actor and director with Broadway and regional credits. He has appeared in the Public Theater production of one-act plays by Vaclav Havel, and on television in \\"Simon and Simon\\" and \\"Hart to Hart.\\" He has worked at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis and the McCarter Theater in Princeton, and he received a directorial award for his Los Angeles productions of plays by Noel Coward and William Saroyan.    \\"I used as much of Dickens' language as I could,\\" said Mr. Mills, \\"and preserved the story.\\" But leading into it is an opening pantomime. A small boy, unable to sleep after a family Christmas party, begins reading \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in bed. Lapsing into a dream world he imagines that his ancestors come alive from their portraits on the wall, transporting him into the Dickens tale.    As background for the play, Mr. Landrum's music, which he will play on a synthesizer, incorporates a number of sound effects including Marley's clanking chains. A specialist on keyboard instruments and synthesizers, he has recorded with Herbie Mann, Neil Sedaka, Benny Mardones and many others, and he recorded the sound tracks for the haunting signature music he arranged for \\"Twin Peaks\\" and for David Lynch's film \\"Wild at Heart.\\"    The sets are minimally suggested with movable panels, and the costumes adhere to the period of the novel. The production will be presented in the recently restored Irvington Town Hall Theater at the corner of North Ferris and Main Streets. Performances are scheduled at 2 and 7 P.M. Saturday, 5 P.M. next Sunday, and 7 P.M. on Dec. 20, 21 and 22, with a 2 P.M. matinee on Dec. 22 and a 3 P.M. on matinee Dec. 23. Tickets are $8 for adults, $6 for students and the elderly. Call 591-9533 for reservations. FREE PROGRAM     A seasonal music program is offered at 5 P.M. today, when Pachelbel's \\"Magnificat in G\\" and Bach's Cantata \\"For Unto Us a Child Is Born\\" will be performed at the Church of St. Barnabas in Irvington. Donald Butt will conduct a string orchestra, flutes, organ and soloists. The free concert is open to the public, but offerings will be welcome. The church is at 15 North Broadway.

Candlelight tours of the Federal mansion are to be held from 5 to 7:30 P.M. Friday through next Sunday. The tours begin outdoors along lantern-lighted paths leading to the front door.    Inside, a kissing ball of boxwood and mistletoe hangs from an archway, and the staircase is entwined with evergreen roping made even more fragrant with lemon leaves and apples. Arrangements of greens, fruits and nuts, flowering cyclamen and narcissus fill the tables and fireplace mantles, and in the dining room the Duncan Phyfe furniture is laden with 19th-century desserts and decorations. A croquembouche, or pyramid of cream puffs, a Twelfth-Night Cake and miniature trees blooming with tiny oranges are some of the more elegant comestibles.    A wassail bowl will be set up in the kitchen, where visitors may sample a glass or two of the hot mulled cider and a slice of fruit cake.    The mansion is on Route 9D, eight miles north of the Bear Mountain Bridge, and admission is $5 for adults, $4 for the elderly and $2.50 for children through 14. Children younger than 6 are admitted free. Call 265-3638 for more information. MEXICAN BUSINESS     Westchester's World Trade Club continues its series of programs on doing business around the world.

Canine life in Nome, where the movie is set, revolves around dog-sled races that have the fervor of high-school football games. The local hero and top dog is an unscrupulous, predatory ladies' man named Steele (the voice of Jim Cummings), whose swaggering ways set female hearts aflutter. Steele and his cronies take delight in humiliating poor Balto (Kevin Bacon), who has a serious  crush on a sleek rust-colored huskie named Jenna (Bridget Fonda).         \\"Balto,\\" the newest cartoon from Amblin Entertainment, runs only 74 minutes,  but it succeeds in packing them with more than enough of wholesome wintertime adventure. At the same time, the film, directed by Simon Wells, skillfully adapts a true story into an easy-to-swallow anthropomorphic fable about courage, honesty and peer pressure, in which the schoolyard bully gets his comeuppance.

By mixing city and country styles, putting well-turned melodies atop kinetic dance rhythms and writing playful, ingenious lyrics, Mr. Guerra has forged pop songs that delight outsiders while reminding Dominicans of home.   The singer was a cheerful but oddly reticent figure on stage, dressed in black with changing accessories and rarely speaking between songs.

So Mr. Hurford spoke to the audience before sitting down to play, as more and more musicians do nowadays.         It was all very leisurely, to be sure. The donnish performer expressed his joy at being back in New York, where he first performed 36 years ago. Then he discussed the church's organ, a large Aeolian-Skinner, which he described as \\"a  great American instrument\\" if a somewhat anachronistic one for most of the pieces he was about to play. To the obvious surprise and delight of much of the  audience, he pointed out that the many sets of pipes scattered about the church  included one in the top of the dome, called \\"Gabriel's horn,\\" which he planned to use in Stanley's \\"Trumpet Voluntary.\\" Finally, he took up the music and the composers, noting, for example, how Francois Couperin and Daquin related to Bach in time and place.

The sensation was quite odd.  Here was the same funny, agreeably addlepated show - modified a bit, dated in spots, yet essentially the cuckoo-klatch I'd always been so fond of - groping somewhat to locate itself in space. And here, too, was the audience, quite ready to be entertained as soon as it got its bearings but, at the outset, not entirely certain what those bearings might be.   The show, and the people looking at it, weren't on easy, familiar terms with each other. They were more nearly strangers, and they seemed to need formal introductions if they were to become close friends sometime before curtain-fall. The audience did finally get the hang of ''Little Me.'' As I went up the aisle at evening's end, I was looking at rows of beamish faces, faces that were both pleased with the unfamiliar style of the show and also pleased with themselves for having managed to get the hang of it.

If most country music still directs itself to white, rural working people, it has also become increasingly suburbanized and has assimilated many of the stylistic elements of old-time rock-and-roll, a genre that has come to seem quaint to a younger, post-punk rock audience. And unlike rock and hip-hop, country music reveres traditional standards of songwriting craft and celebrates polished voices, instrumental virtuosity and ensemble teamwork.

It was produced by Tobis of Berlin from a story by Peter Bolt, and directed by Carmine Gallone. It is one of the few pictures that has real surprises in its narrative. The man the spectator thinks is going to come out winner perishes by his own design, and the more or less unpopular husband emerges from a hazardous desert exploit with his life and a huge bag of gold nuggets.It is a pity that the scenarist saw fit to make the story too unwieldy, for there is so much to it that one almost forgets that which has gone before. Actually, the basic idea is concerned with 413 women supposed to have been sent out from England, about half a century ago, to become wives of men they have never met in Western Australia. One of the women dies on the voyage and, through a fresh allotment of numbers, the man who was to have wedded woman No. 68 finds himself without a bride. He afterward learns of what happened from one of the officers of the ship that carried the women to the Antipodes and falls in love at first sight with the woman, Elga Brink, No. 68, who obviously finds her particular husband, Steve Parker, a gold miner of Coolgardie, incompatible. However, she does not reciprocate the admiration of the man who should have married her, but becomes enamored of an American physician.There are several imaginative stretches in this film, one being where the disappointed man, Dick Ashton, a telegraph operator, after learning that he has been cheated out of the lovely Evelyne Bernheim, becomes so nervous that he suffers hysterical fit after witnessing the forced scrubbing of a man. Conrad Veidt, who plays Ashton, gives a sterling exhibition of the high-strung fellow, but it takes too long. In another chapter, Mr. Veidt, as the telegraph operator, realizes through telegraphic devices that the man who stands, as Ashton thinks, between himself and happiness, is in need of assistance in a desert area and the telegrapher ponders whether to send help to Parker or let him die. He decides finally to pretend that he has received no message, and later the fact that he believes Parker has perished further unhinges his mind.The desert scenes with the two gold miners, first joyous at their discovery of gold, then quarreling over their share of the precious metal and finally discovering that while they have gold their water tank has sprung a leak and they face death from thirst, are finely filmed. These episodes are mindful of Jack London's story, \\"Love of Life.\\" Parker, instead of neglecting his companion, does all he can to save the man's life and then and there is a glimpse of fateful irony. One man has succumbed to a parched throat and the other's life appears to be ebbing when a deluge of rain falls. It is too late for one, but it is in time for Parker, the stronger man.There are one or two songs, but curiously enough the director makes the Australians of the wide open spaces of fifty years ago sing first in English and then in German. During the few sound interludes the actual recording is quite effective. Sometimes the hardy men of this yarn also converse in German and at other times in English. The titles and the inserts are all in German.Mr. Veidt's work is as good as anything he has done, a little slow sometimes, but none the less painstaking and earnest. The director, however, gives over too much time to Mr. Veidt's reactions without considering what's happening to the other characters. In the cases of other individuals, M. Gallone delights in dilating upon their suffering.Elga Brink is prepossessing as Evelyne Bernheim. Clifford McLaglen is capital as Steve Parker. Mathias Wieman officiates acceptably as the American physician. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A Drama of Australia."},{"year":"1934","title":"Despite the assertion on the program of the Acme Theatre in Union Square this week that its new Russian-language picture \\"reflects the transition of Russian society from feudalism to commercial capitalism,\\" the average American film patron is likely to classify \\"Dom Zhadnosti\\" (\\"House of Greed\\") as good, old-fashioned melodrama.And if the language spoken were English, as is that of the silent titles, and the settings were not so thoroughly Russian, he might think he were witnessing a well-photographed American morality play aimed at the vices of avarice and lust. For this sordid tragedy might have happened on a New England farm just as well as on the estate of one of the minor landed nobility of the old régime in Russia. Although the villainous central figure, depicted almost too dramatically by V. R. Gardin, an excellent Soviet actor, is finally driven out into the storm by phantoms, presumably to perish, there is less soul-searching than is usually encountered in Russian tales of this sort.T. Bulatch and N. Latonina are charming and quite effective in spite of a little overacting, as the nieces who fall victims to their uncle's penuriousness and general vileness. The other principals, representing a merchant, a servant girl, the old miser's son and a couple of aged women, also do good work, while several of the unnamed actors fill their lesser parts practically to perfection. Many of the scenes on the farm and in a small-town music hall of about sixty-five years ago are highly interesting and sometimes amusing.

That is the poetry of this play -- its \\"dream music,\\" in the narrator's phrase -- and like the most fragrant music, it strikes deep chords that words cannot begin to touch.

McNeil had known about this two days before, but he had kept the information from his wife, Liz.   It was more than embarrassment. For Howard McNeil, it had the potential of personal tragedy.  McNeil, who is 22 years old, with clean features, an easy smile and a well-spoken manner, was the co-captain of the Seton Hall Pirates.  He played point guard - an unusual position for a player who stands 6 feet 9 inches tall. He was the second-tallest player on the team, but he is a deft ball handler - the basketball term is, ''He's got eyes.'' He was also versatile, and he had started for Seton Hall at center as a freshman and at forward as a sophomore.   For not meeting the 2.0 minimum grade-point average, McNeil's already-slim chances of playing for a lot of money in the National Basketball Association - a dream he has held since boyhood - could be in jeopardy. McNeil's is a dream shared by thousands of others","excerpt":"a dream that is realized by precious few.

Ms. Lang danced with Martha Graham for 30 years and has been choreographing since the 1950's. What was surprising was the crackling energy and excitement of much of the work on the program, which was dedicated to the memory of Martha Hill, the pioneering modern-dance educator, who died in November.         In part that excitement was due to the impressive energy and discipline of the performers, many of whom have danced with the Graham senior and junior companies. That mix was epitomized by the dancing of Lexuri Gallastegi, who spun like a small tornado through the clusters of women in the opening section of \\"Quartets,\\" women who resembled Valkyries as imagined by Botticelli. Set to Schubert quartets, the 1995 group dance maintained that look of vibrant tumult through much of its second half.

Yet as the small traveling survey \\"Morris Graves: Reconciling Inner and Outer Realities, 1932-1983\\" demonstrates, he remains one of our most distinctive artists. There is no other major figure who resembles him, and he has inspired no followers.   Although much has been made of the strong connection of his work to Asian art, this show, at the Schmidt Bingham Gallery, also clearly indicates his Western roots. These are particularly evident in the work from the 1930's.

The film's central character is an anomaly by definition: a surly young drifter in a society that seemingly places much value on discipline and purpose. \\"Original Sin\\" takes a slightly awed view of this drifter's utter amorality and self-interest.   The film begins startlingly as this drifter, Makoto (Masatoshi Nagase), glimpses the demurely beautiful Nami (Shinobu Ohtake) at a train station. Almost literally thunderstruck, he watches her through torrential rain that is filmed so slowly and grandiosely it looks like snow.  After this, he feels destined to follow her to the real estate office where she works, and where the boss turns out to be her husband. Undeterred by this, Makoto gets a low-level job in the same office. \\"If I can work with a woman like you, I won't be greedy about money,\\" he tells Nami, who looks stunned by his brash assurance.

For two and a half hours, one can take a sentimental journey on the wings of songs and devil hang the fact that, from a technical standpoint, the feature film, \\"You Can't Fool an Irishman,\\" and its companion subjects, \\"A Touch of Shamrock\\" and \\"Irish Melody,\\" may not be beyond criticism.\\"You Can't Fool an Irishman\\" supplies a few thin laughs as it recounts the misadventures of a Hollywood producer who goes broke in Dublin before he can even start his cameras turning on a projected drama about the life of St. Patrick and ends up in merry confusion on the Island of Innishtide. Tommy Duggan plays the producer with an accent that sounds suspiciously Hungarian, and Shamus Locke does well enough in the role of a handsome waiter who is picked to play St. Patrick when he promises to raise £500. With a contract in his hand from the famous producer, the young man raises the money, sure enough, but spends it all on a grand party for the folks on Innishtide, proving, no doubt, that \\"You Can't Fool an Irishman.\\"The glories of Ireland are appropriately celebrated with singing by Barry Keegan of \\"Galway Bay,\\" \\"Kathleen Mavourneen\\" and \\"The Low Backed Car,\\" among others, in \\"Irish Melody.\\" This is a featurette in which the story is only incidental to the scenery.

With the silvery sheen of his ride cymbal and the sure and quiet snaps of his snare drum, Mr. Higgins conveys a conversational intelligence, and does it with a deep swing. Ever since Mr. Higgins made his first major jazz appearance, as Ornette Coleman's drummer, it's been obvious that his art was the art of control, of the deft touch.   Mr. Higgins was featured at the Walter Reade Theater on Thursday night as part of Lincoln Center's jazz program, and he brought along a series of longtime friends and associates, including Cedar Walton and Chris Anderson on piano, Ron Carter and David Williams on bass and George Coleman on saxophone. For Mr. Higgins, these are familiar faces -- he recently finished a week at Bradley's with Mr. Anderson -- and it could have been just another set of standards, performed beautifully.

For Kate, 11, and Emily, 7, the horses were the instant source of excitement. After the wranglers put on a welcoming mini-rodeo, we all walked over to the stables. As the kids were being fitted to saddles, it dawned on them that they were about to be given horses of their own for the next week -- huge, sleek animals fully prepared to take them wherever they wanted to go. From that moment on, our children became utterly self-sufficient. They had the run of the ranch.

But none were quite as ardent as Adriaan Lubbers, a Dutch artist who visited the city for the first time in 1916, when he was 33 years old, and fell in love with what he saw.    As is evidenced by the small, often wonderful exhibition \\"Adriaan Lubbers in New York,\\" at the Museum of the City of New York, Lubbers made the city's soaring bridges and skyscrapers, its narrow man-made canyons and spreading panoramas the central motifs of his career. Part realistic and part expressionistic in style -- with occasional hints of the visionary -- his paintings evoke the bustling grandeur of Manhattan between the two world wars, while their animated textures give the city a wonderfully accessible, even intimate sense of detail.

I'd demand them to be.'' Watching this creaky, periodically visually arresting and often (unintentionally?) amusing artifact several decades after it first impressed swarms of the groovy and the gullible, including its enthusiastic fan John Lennon, it is easy to appreciate the wisdom of Mr. Jodorowsky's prescription. Even a couple of aspirins would improve the viewing experience. In his funny, fleet account of the film's creation and reception in the book ''Midnight Movies,'' the critic J. Hoberman drops some jaw-dropping factoids about ''El Topo,'' including the unsavory revelations that the gutted donkeys in the opening scene were slaughtered for the film and that a woman's rape is reputedly the real deal. The fractured narrative is the least of it: Mr. Jodorowsky plays the title character, ''the mole,'' a man in black who wanders a phantasmagoric Mexican landscape laden with dead bunnies and burros, snarling hippie chicks, pregnant silences, buckets of blood and guru-gunslingers, all of whom he must challenge before achieving transcendence (or something) in a cave populated by the abject and socially rejected. Prophet or profiteer, Mr. Jodorowsky is certainly not without talent and, despite the petty and genuine outrages committed during the making of his film, ''El Topo'' remains an arresting relic of a time seriously, freakily out of joint. The film is screening digitally, Dec. 13 to Dec. 19. After its New York rerelease, it will travel the country with Mr. Jodorowsky's 1973 offering, ''The Holy Mountain''","excerpt":"a DVD release of the two titles, along with a third, ''Fando y Lis,'' is promised.

MANOHLA DARGIS 'El Topo'"},{"year":"2006","title":"THE BASICS -- Guests might expect a hotel started by Benny Andersson to have at least one bit of Abba memorabilia in the lobby -- Bjorn's guitar or maybe Frida's orange jumpsuit. But sadly, other than an Abba CD in your room, there is little at the Hotel Rival to make visitors parade around in platforms or start whistling ''Waterloo.'' Despite this, the city's newest boutique hotel is still a fitting tribute to Mr. Andersson, the Swedish rock star.      Not only did he restore a 1930's Art Deco cinema, making it part of the hotel, he also provided the city with a lively new meeting complex. With two bars, a bistro, a cafe and bakery -- to say nothing of the cinema, now a cultural center for screenings, concerts and theater -- sleeping in one of the hotel's 99 sleek rooms seems secondary to hanging out in its many public spaces.    THE LOCATION -- Situated on the beautiful tree-lined square of Mariatorget in the formerly working class, now artsy Sondermalm district on the southern island, the Hotel Rival is a great base for exploring the city by foot, subway or taxi. Gamla Stan, the heart of the old city and filled with small shops and intimate restaurants, is a 10-minute walk from the hotel.    THE LOBBY -- By far the most eccentric furnishing in this hotel's lobby -- and that's saying a lot for a room that has pink chairs, orange ottomans, red leather sofas and polka-dot lampshades -- is the big double bed made up with white pillows and a fluffy duvet. It looks like the perfect place to snooze after one too many martinis in the bar. But with various doors and openings leading to the cafe, the cinema, the bakery and a bar, and a grand circular staircase leading up to the hotel restaurant, relaxing in this multifunctional space can be challenging with so many people entering and departing from all directions. People watching, however, takes the sting out of the cost of drinks: two vodka and tonics were 172 kronor ($22.55 at 7.9 kronor to the dollar) and this in the homeland of Absolut!    THE ROOMS -- My husband and I had a standard room, the cheapest, with a view of a courtyard and various families' kitchens. Though small, the room was equipped with a 32-inch plasma screen TV","excerpt":"a DVD/CD player, on which we blasted Abba's ''Dancing Queen'' (though only one of us could dance at a time and only in one place); a desk with electrical connections, including for a Sony PlayStation (the hotel also has wireless Internet), and a closet with a minibar, a safe and an ironing board. That left little room for clothes.     The double bed had luxurious Egyptian cotton sheets but was adorned with a teddy bear (every room gets one), which seemed bizarre since few people had kids in tow. Each room had a giant black-and-white Swedish film still over the bed. We had a Bergman. Other rooms have a Garbo and four have a shot of the group from ''Abba -- The Movie.'' Too bad that was not one of the 16 films in the DVD library.    THE BATHROOM -- Though not much bigger than an airplane lavatory, it was clean and modern. A bathroom stereo sound system provided another opportunity for dancing to Abba -- though this time in the confines of a small shower with a window onto the room. Those not wishing to perform publicly can make use of the shower blind. The ''Fernando''-singing fun ended, however, when the shower overflowed, forcing me to use the plush towels to soak up the water.    ROOM SERVICE -- The 24-hour menu is extensive and offers various Swedish dishes, including shrimp with mayonnaise for 120 kronor, spiced pickled herring and roe for 130 kronor, as well as a chocolate selection for 72 kronor.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- The Hotel Rival has the feel of a hip college dormitory with buzzing common rooms. Standard double rooms cost about a third less on weekends (when breakfast is included for all guests), starting at 1,390 kronor ($182) a night, superior rooms at 1,590 and deluxe at 1,790. The executive room start at 3,390 and suites at 3,890.     Hotel Rival, Mariatorget 3, Stockholm; 46-8-5457-8900; www.rival.se.

He declared that the world, for its political survival, must find a new, shared system of transcendent values to replace the traditional religious beliefs that science has eroded. And he proposed to derive this new value system from a surprising source -- science itself.    It's rare enough to hear a politician talk about transcendent values, rarer still one willing to lay out a plan for developing a new universal system. And it's especially notable that this man, who spent his life resisting one system that claimed universal validity, should seek so soon after the death of Communism to erect another. If his high arc above the mundane proves less than fully satisfying, it's because the scientific ideas he selected for his oracle have more elegance than substance.

She  told folk tales in schools and Hans Christian Andersen stories in Central Park,  and wrote about myths in books. One day she was evicted from her rent-stabilized apartment. Now she is homeless, fighting her eviction in court and hoping to return home to live happily ever after.         But Robert M. Olshever, the lawyer for Ms. Wolkstein's landlord, tells a different story. He says Ms. Wolkstein was evicted in February because she would not let the landlord, Andrew Duell, enter her apartment to install a ventilation system. Ms. Wolkstein says that she was then in Australia collecting aboriginal  folk tales and that her former lawyer bungled the case in her absence.

In France, where he's regarded as the most important dramatist to appear between the death of Moliere and the birth of Beaumarchais, it's enough to mention only his last name. Now the playwright's genius is finally being being recognized in the United States, where an increasing number of Marivaux comedies are beginning to turn up Off Broadway and in regional theaters.         Thus the timing could not be better for the arrival of \\"The Inconstant Lovers\\" (\\"La Double Inconstance\\"), the sleek, exuberantly performed Comedie-Francaise production that opened on Tuesday night at the Majestic Theater in Brooklyn.

Chris Alt, the heavier sister of Carol Alt, the successful model, describes seeing a photograph of Karen Carpenter in the last stages of starvation and thinking \\"she was very lucky.\\" Ms. Alt recalls having \\"wondered how I could get that skinny without dying.\\" Another woman remembers dieting frantically as a teen-ager because she had a chance to meet Elvis Presley in Las Vegas and indeed being complimented by Elvis on her good looks. That accomplished, she ballooned back up to 200 pounds.

WOLF'S SLOOP WINS IN SHIELDS CLASS"},{"year":"1990","title":"While city streets are rife with hazards for the elderly -- from uneven sidewalks to drivers who race through intersections and muggers who prey on the frail and weak -- most older people eel safe in their own homes.    But accident statistics belie this sense of security. Fully 40 percent of deaths because of injuries to people 65 years old and over occur from accidents at home. The Problem    As people age, changes in sensory and physical functions increase their vulnerability to accidental injury. Typical changes may include diminished visual acuity, depth perception, hearing and odor perception","excerpt":"a faltering sense of balance and increased susceptibility to dizziness; decreased agility and strength, and slower movements and reflexes.    Together with more fragile bones, vulnerable joints and impairments caused by medications and chronic ailments, these changes mean older people are more likely to suffer serious disability and even death from accidents.    With winter approaching, the hazards in the home often multiply. People spend more time indoors, and there are fewer hours of daylight as well as an increase in the use of heating devices.   There is no better time than now to do a home-safety check and make changes in living areas occupied by older people.    The Hartford Insurance Group, a subsidiary of the ITT Corporation, recently built a model home with safety improvements, most of which cost well under $100. The company also produced a booklet including 120 suggested safety measures, listing their approximate costs and offering one or more sources that sell recommended items. The booklet, \\"How to Modify a Home to Accommodate the Needs of an Older Adult,\\" is available from the Hartford Insurance Group, Hartford Plaza, Hartford, Conn. 06115. Steps to a Safer Home    One way to help safeguard the home for the elderly is to make it easier to see and hear. An 80-year-old needs two to three times more illumination than a teen-ager. Place lamps and overhead lights to eliminate shadows. Overhead lighting, operated by switches at top and bottom, is especially important in stairways.   Bulbs of 100 to 200 watts should be used for close work and taking medication. Install fluorescent lights in the kitchen over the sink, stove and work counters.   Night lights should be strategically placed to insure safe trips to the bathroom and kitchen in the night. Also helpful is an entryway light that turns itself on when it starts to get dark, and an emergency light that goes on automatically if electrical power is lost.    Avoid carpets with complex patterns. Use light-colored dishes on darker table coverings or placemats and choose countertop and furniture colors that contrast with the flooring. If floor heights change between rooms, use contrasting floor colors. Secure textured tape in a contrasting color to the edge of each step.    To counter hearing losses, reduce echoes and noise with carpeting, window fabrics, upholstered furniture and acoustical tiles on walls and ceilings. Install a volume adjuster or amplifier on the telephone and provide a cordless headset for watching television.    Another way for the elderly to make the home safer is to counter their lost agility and strength. Replace cylindrical glasses and delicate cups with large-handled mugs. Install handrails from top to bottom on both sides of stairwells, and curve the railings away from the stairs at the bottom to provide a tactile clue to the last step.    Install lever-type handles on kitchen and bathroom faucets and C-shaped pulls on drawers and cabinets. Place cabinets so that the top shelf is easily reached without climbing. In closets, use multilevel shelves and hanging bars to make clothing items more accessible.    The elderly should also take precautions to prevent fires and burns. Appliances that heat up, like irons, space heaters and toasters, should be equipped with an automatic shutoff. (One can be installed if the appliance lacks it.) Use heat-sensitive decals on appliances that say \\"Stop Hot\\" when the item is on and use a bathtub thermometer that warns if the water is too hot.    A stove top with staggered burners eliminates the need to reach over hot pots and burners. A stock pot with a deep strainer basket (spaghetti cooker) eliminates the need to empty large pots of boiling water.    A small fire extinguisher should hang in the kitchen, and all occupants should know how to use it without having to stop to read the instructions. And, of course, there should be at least one operating smoke detector on every floor, especially in or near the bedrooms.    Never work around the stove or fireplace in loose-fitting clothing that could accidentally ignite. If a room's electrical outlet capacity has to be increased, use a UL-listed outlet extender that has a circuit breaker.    If an older person sleeps on an upper floor, install a fire escape.   Set the water heater to a nonscalding temperature (120 degrees or lower). Install an adapter under the sink that automatically mixes hot and cold water to a pre-set temperature that prevents scalding. An anti-scald safety valve that reduces the flow of water if it gets too hot can be installed on shower heads and faucets.    The elderly should also make an extra effort to prevent falls. It does not take much to break the bones of most older people, so avoiding falls is of utmost importance. In addition to the stairway safety measures discussed earlier, never leave objects on the steps or the landings.    Avoid placing low-lying furniture like coffee tables, hassocks and stools where the pieces might be tripped over. And if furniture is rearranged, make sure the older person is made familiar with the new setting. Place furniture to steer people around structural hazards like low ceilings or open stairwells.    It is best to cover wood and tile floors with wall-to-wall carpeting with a low pile, or use rubberized tiles that are not waxed. If rugs are used their edges should be fixed to the floor with double-sided rug tape. Do not use scatter rugs. Be sure that all electric cords are placed behind furniture or along the bottom of the wall where they cannot be tripped over.    Use nonskid stick-on decals in the tub and shower or a good rubber mat with strong suction cups.    Mount grab bars in the bathroom, especially next to the toilet and around the tub or shower. Place a shower stool in the tub and attach a hand-held shower hose for sit-down bathing.    If you are taking medication that can cause dizziness, be especially careful when you stand up, particularly when arising from sleep, after eating or getting out of the tub.    In addition to the Hartford booklet, literature on home safety is available from the American Association of Retired Persons, Fulfillment, 1909 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20049.

Merely a simple recognition that a difference exists between the media of stage and screen, and that one cannot just make a ballet film by taking a stage production and setting a camera on it. Today and tomorrow the Russian film of \\"The Sleeping Beauty,\\" danced by Leningrad's Kirov Ballet, is opening its first local engagements. One wishes it well. It is not a perfect dance film, but it tries, it tries intelligently, and it is a great deal better than the low average of dance films to come our way.The great Petipa and Tchaikovsky classic \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\" is ideal material for the film","excerpt":"a familiar story, a well-loved score and some of the finest classical choreography ever created.The difficulty, frankly, is that the camera rarely seems to catch the dance instant. In all dance there is, apart from the dance itself, a touch of daring, a threat of failure. Perhaps it is rather like high-wire walking — whoever wanted to see a film of a man walking a tight-rope?Yet in \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\" the Russians have at least attempted to capture dancing in cinematic terms. There have been losses—not least some apparently pointless cuts in the ballet—but the cameras range across the dancers with a welcome freedom, and there are even a few lurid attempts at trick photography. Obviously the great advantage here has been the presence of Konstantin Sergeyev, the ballet master and director of the Kirov Ballet, who has not only adapted the choreography, but also been partly responsible for directing and producing the film, and for making certain changes in the libretto.The fancified settings and costumes are frequently too garish for Western taste, and the color photography, while better than some emanating from the Soviet studios, is not as truthful or as pleasing as the best of Western color. But there is always the dancing of the Kirov, particularly the dancing of the two young Kirov stars, Alla Sizova and Yuri Soloviev.Miss Sizova is radiant and delicate, a great ballerina in the first flush of her powers. Mr. Soloviev is no great dance actor, but combines power with impeccable ease. As a male stylist there is no one else in the world, not in New York, in London, or even in Moscow, to match him.

A young woman is robbed on a lonely ridge near her home. The mugging, which takes place on the woman's wedding day, leaves her in a state of disorientation. Her confusion lasts almost to the end of the play, a convoluted tale about siblings and cousins who live their lives without a sense of direction or destination.   Does change come through choice or chance? Ms. Johnson's answer is as elusive as her narrative. One point she is evidently trying to make is that people are trapped not only by their past mistakes and but also by the actions of their parents. For these characters, life can be as uncontrollable as a runaway roller coaster. As the play (at the Manhattan Theater Club) veers from eccentric comedy to pathos, the theatrical role model it evokes is Beth Henley's \\"Crimes of the Heart.\\" But where Ms. Henley made us care deeply about her people, those in Ms. Johnson's family play quickly wear out their welcome.

But when results of the magazine's 1994 survey of overall performance and reputation were published last week, Edelman had slipped to fourth place, changing places with Porter/Novelli, a unit of the Omnicom Group, which has risen to first place from fourth.   Still, Edelman is enjoying a run of success that most of its competitors can only envy. Though revenue growth slowed last year to 5.9 percent, 1993 was a year in which many other large public relations agencies suffered declines.

''It happened at rush hour, when the traffic gets so dense it slows to a near halt,'' Mr. Steers says. ''I would take my keys out of the ignition, put the lock on the steering wheel and open the car door to step out, at which point I would suddenly become conscious of what I'd just done.''     Mr. Steers was in New York recently for the premiere of his first film, a smart new satire called ''Igby Goes Down,'' which opened here on Friday and was inspired by his brother's death. The movie is often hilarious, but beneath its impious surface there's more than a hint of something bleak. Similarly, in quiet moments, Mr. Steers's light brown eyes tend to stare a little, as if straining to see past something terrible that never quite goes away. ''It isn't just that he died,'' he says. ''The disease really mutilated him.''

In this drama of a Ukrainian family's struggle to survive a Government-created famine that killed more than seven million (a quarter of the population) in 1933, the suffering is etched in the stony faces of people too weary and weak to raise their voices.   In an early scene, the members of an impoverished farming family solemnly take turns dipping their ladles into the single bowl of watery soup that is their only meal of the day. Later in the film, scores of villagers numb with despair and hunger huddle silently in the pouring rain outside a Government office until a truckload of armed soldiers arrives to disperse them. In the most poignant scene, a little boy who has lost his parents calls for his mother as he wanders panic-stricken through a snowy woodland where the trees are outnumbered by crosses marking the dead.

In the second part, Ken Bullock, a performance artist from Georgia, does ultra-campy sendups of Southern cultural stereotypes. The members of Instant Girl (Janet Bogardus, Joanna Heimbold and Susan Trout), the performance trio that concluded the show, have known one another since childhood.

This screen horse, after spending months on the stage winning races back of the scenes in a melodrama, brings home the bacon in the Suburban at Havana, thus helping out the stranded theatrical company and defeating the purpose of the mustachioed scoundrels. Hot Heels, as this valiant animal is known, accomplishes this feat without training, carrying a jockey weighing about 160 pounds and after being virtually left at the post. It is no wonder that his rider, Glenn, is dazed at the finish and has to be told by the fair Patsy that Hot Heels has won. As a reward Hot Heels is permitted to appear in the final fade-out, when Glenn and Patsy are in each others arms.\\"Hot Heels\\" is an amusing farce. It begins by poking fun at the thundering race-track melodramas and ends by having a little fun with itself. Glenn Tryon is kept active throughout this comedy, doing smart stunts, revealing the result of his imaginative genius while presiding over a smal town hotel and pursuing Patsy, the peach of his eye.It is, as a matter of fact, a picture that is quite well done. Its absurdities are invariably humorous and Mr. Tryon's preparedness for the camera is something to marvel at. He even has the happy idea of gluing his gloves to his cane, besides being credited with running an automatic hotel, with special tracks for bags and ice-water and a device for flattening out the stairs to skid the parting guest.Several sequences of this adventure are given over to imitating an old-style thriller. The players and the audience are seen, and also Mr. Tryon officiating not only as the orchestra, but as the master of effects.In this picture is Tod Sloan, the jockey who years ago was the favorite of all riders. He figures as a melodrama jockey who is unable to ride Hot Heels, in Havana, because the villain gives this small man half a dozen lefts and rights on the eve of the race.

But by now, musicians and bands all over the world are trying their hands at funk. It's the common rhythmic language that allows British new wave rock to fit snugly into the musical formats of black-oriented innercity radio stations and unites whites and blacks on night-club dance floors.   Funk rhythms are put together by stacking various rhythmic patterns together, and while the details of the patterns have changed somewhat, the way in which they are stacked, the roles of the various instruments in the funk rhythm section, and even the ideal balance of the instruments have changed surprisingly little in the past 15 years. But now funk is changing. Part of the impetus for this change must have come from the experiments of various avant-gardists.

On the occasion of its renaissance it is a talking picture, but that is about the only change. It is still a light comedy, one fairly amusing in spots but one that is not worth traveling very far to see.Douglas Fairbanks Jr. has the rôle of Norman Overbeck, the young man whose second marriage is postponed because of his discovery of a child from the first. It is postponed indefinitely, as a matter of fact, for after being engaged to practically every member of the supporting cast, Norman decides to try life again with his divorced wife. The play was a little different than this, censorship of the stage and screen being distinct matters.Most of the comedy, or what passes for comedy around the Globe, takes place in a Chicago maternity hospital, to which Norman has been summoned the day before his scheduled second wedding. He is told there that he has experienced paternity, and that the mother wishes to give over the child to adoption. He can't quite see it and so smuggles the baby out and tries to care for it himself. Then the mother appears, and all, is well.Originally from Floyd Dell's novel, the play was by Mr. Dell and Thomas Mitchell. Gene Towne was responsible for the screen adaptation. The lines on the whole are not very exciting—some of them with vitality lowered by the necessity of keeping just outside the range of Mr. Will Hays's shears.

A1    Yeltsin Flexing Federal Muscle  President Boris N. Yeltsin planned to remove Yevgeny Nazdratenko from his post as Governor of the Primorsky region in the Russian Far East, a spokesman for Mr. Yeltsin said.
