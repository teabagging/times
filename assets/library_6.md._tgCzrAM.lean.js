One of John Coltrane's most able students, Gary Bartz is a searing saxophonist with a hard, unforgiving tone. This is modern improvising at its best: Harmony is a playground, and dissonance is just another color to be fooled with, not feared. Mr. Bartz is at that awkward age for jazz musicians, between their early 30's and late 50's, when they tend to be overlooked. It's also the age of their greatest strength, when technique and knowledge combine to produce the best playing of a musician's career.

She's an expansive performer working with a limited technique, but that gives her a forthrightness that makes her material seem all that much more heartfelt. It might all be performance rhetoric, but she is as convincing as any other singer working, and she can make an audience believe that her song selections are based on personal experience.

Claude Williams is known to some as the Count Basie Orchestra's original guitarist (replaced by Freddie Green). Mr. Williams didn't stop there: at 84, he's an astoundingly fertile improviser, but on violin.

Mr. Leonhart, aside from being the most ubiquitous bassist in New York, also writes witty character sketches in verse that he sings to his own bass accompaniment. At Zinno, Mr. Kellaway's repertory will range from Duke Ellington's \\"Creole Love Call\\" and such pop standards as \\"I'll Never Be The Same\\" to selections originally written for the cello quartet and adapted for a duo with Mr. Leonhart's bowed bass taking the cello role.

Elba Ramalho hails from northeastern Brazil, home of forro, frevo and other styles that don't get exported as frequently as the samba and bossa nova of Rio de Janeiro. Through the 1980's, she has been one of Brazil's most popular singers, with a hearty voice and contagious energy. Her repertory embraces songs from Brazil's best-known Rio-based songwriters along with material closer to her home. Sets are to be at 9 and 11 P.M. tonight and tomorrow and at 9 P.M.

The saxophonist Marty Ehrlich always leads some of the more intelligent bands around, with compositions that take advantage of all sorts of musical possibilities. He works with jazz, but some elements in the music are akin to the experimentalism of new music. And Mr. Ehrlich, on everything from clarinet to tenor saxophone, is always an incisive improviser, lyrical and aware of texture. Shows are tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30. There is a $10 cover charge and a two-drink minimum.  Sounds of Haiti    Zin, and Rara Machine, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, Manhattan, (212) 243-4940. Two of the city's best young Haitian bands, Zin and Rara Machine, get together for your dancing pleasure. Like many other musicians investigating their musical culture, the members of these bands are going back to older styles, working with voodoo and carnival rhythms. The mixture of the drum and shiny technology will probably go down as a classic period in their music, and here is a good chance to get it firsthand.

Joe Chambers is one of the best drummers jazz has, a living reminder of how well some musicians, during the 1960's, incorporated experimentalism in their playing. And as a composer, he writes music that never seems quite settled, just the sort to force his musicians to think before they play. He's leading a quartet that features the ever-improving Antonio Hart on saxophone. Shows tonight and tomorrow night are at 9, 10:30 and 12. There is a $10 cover and a $10 minimum. PETER WATROUS Zairian Sounds    Tabu Ley Rochereau, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. This great Zairian singer is a real treat to hear. He'll croon some, but more than anything he'll engage the whirling guitars of his band. He leads one of the dance world's best groups, a 13-member orchestra that's meant to keep people going and happy all night long. The two shows tomorrow night are at 11 and 1 A.M.","excerpt":"there is a $16 cover. P. W.

The content ranges from the surreal to the measured, and Mr. Greenberger reads them blandly, letting the words and ideas pop and crackle with humor.

Absolutly unruffled, Tommy Flanagan breezes through the hardest be-bop tunes, making the impossible seem normal. He's one of jazz's most gifted improvisers, and he knows his way around a huge variety of tunes, from obscure show-business pieces to the repertory of Tadd Dameron, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell and others. Shows tonight through Sunday are at 10 P.M. and midnight, with a 1:30 A.M. show added tonight and tomorrow. There is a $15 cover and $6 minimum.  Tabou Combo     Tabou Combo, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street in Manhattan, (212) 243-4940.  Compas, the national musical style of Haiti -- of which Tabou Combo is one of the most important exponents -- is all about instrumental independence, where each musician plays a separate line. The independence is great for dancers, who can find inspiration in all the different rhythms. And Tabou Combo, which has just released a new album, \\"Zap Zap,\\" is more than willing to get its special sense of swing going, when the music makes the dance floor feel light.

Abbey Lincoln, whose voice has the sting of lemon rubbed into a fresh cut, is on a roll, with her own extraordinary new album and a heartbreaking cameo on a new recording by the saxophonist Frank Morgan. If Billie Holiday's mixture of acid and pathos has found a modern advocate, it's Ms. Lincoln. Shows tonight through Sunday are at 9 and 11 P.M., with a set at 1 A.M. tonight and tomorrow.

One of the best young bands to come out of Louisiana, Nathan and the Zydeco Cha Chas are there for the audience's dancing pleasure. Part of an explosion in regional activity in Louisiana music, the band represents Creole culture at its Saturday-night best. Mixing blues, French folk music and rock-and-roll, the group kicks up a fuss. Shows tomorrow are at 8:30 and 11:30 P.M. The cover is $12.50. Night of 2 Guitars     Danny Gatton and Lonnie Pitchford, Lone Star Roadhouse, 240 West 52d Street, Manhattan, (212) 245-2950. Danny Gatton and Lonnie Pitchford play entirely separate guitar styles, related but distinct. Mr. Gatton plays a style of his own making that imagines a 1950's hybrid of country, jazz and blues, overdriven and raw and backed by a band. He is as showy as a '59 Cadillac, and twice as smooth. Mr. Pitchford, who can play the one-string diddley bow from Mississippi, is perhaps the best interpreter of Robert Johnson working. He captures both Johnson's drive and his delicacy.

The musical-comedy trio, originally from Dallas and made up of Jim Caruso, Fred Wells and Campbell Martin, is an impeccably smooth harmony ensemble whose wide grasp of musical style is matched by a sly humor. The repertory of the Wiseguys runs from pop standards like \\"The Very Thought of You\\" to Maltby and Shire's comic ode to fitness fanaticism, \\"There's Nothing Like It,\\" which the trio has expanded into an amusing theatrical set piece.

An avowed \\"hopeless romantic\\" in thrall to 1930's and 40's Hollywood dreams, Ms. Marcovicci also personifies a contemporary ideal of womanly glamour and self-determination. The chemistry between her nostalgic and modern sides is frequently compelling, as she sings popular standards with an intensity that makes it seem as though she is reliving the lyrics moment by moment. This weekend she is performing two shows at the Oak Room. \\"Marcovicci Sings Movies and Other Love Songs\\" plays at 9:30 P.M. tonight and tomorrow, and her newest show, \\"Just Kern\\" (music of Jerome Kern, plays both nights at 11:30 P.M.

The portrait of Jelly Roll Morton created by Vernal Bagneris, the New Orleans-based author, director and star of the shows \\"One Mo' Time.\\" \\"Staggerlee\\" and \\"Further Mo\\" is much gentler than that offered on Broadway by Gregory Hines in the hit musical \\"Jelly's Last Jam.\\" The text, taken from 1938 Library of Congress tapes of Morton, suggests a sly, funny commentator who exudes a certain nonchalance even when recalling unhappiness and disappointment.

In the 1960's, he introduced the oud, an ancient Arab instrument that is the precursor of the European lute, and other melodic instruments to the music of his native Nubia. His music blends the complex structure of Arab music with the ancient rhythmic and vocal music of the Upper Nile.

Leny Andrade, who has been called the Brazilian equivalent of Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, is a phenomenal scat singer who wields a large, deep and vibratoless contralto. At the same time, Miss Andrade's passionate, earthy personality is not at all like theirs. While most of her show consists of Brazilian sambas, her set includes a hot, sultry \\"S'Wonderful\\" and a rendition of Dizzy Gillespie's \\"Night in Tunisia\\" that is as jaw-droppingly virtuosic as it is heartfelt.

But gradually their audiences fall off and nobody wants to register anyway and the company begins to split, black and white—until they part, the whites driving their car down one fork in the road, the blacks driving their bus down the other fork in the road, with Michael deposited in front of a stop sign at the intersection, without visible means of transportation.Symbolism at just this level typifies \\"Mississippi Summer,\\" which also fails in dialogue, direction, editing and acting.

The screen contributions seem all too short, which is assuredly a point in their favor. On the other hand, despite the evident artistic value of Mr. Rothafel's features, he is just a trifle too generous in his display.Both Otto Mattieson and Frank Reicher do splendid work in \\"Napoleon's Barber,\\" a talking picture based on a play by Arthur Caesar. Mr. Mattieson plays Napoleon and Mr. Reicher officiates as the would-be revolutionary barber. This half-hour of Napoleon is good enough to cause one to forget the novelty of audible productions, for the story is worked out in an interesting fashion and all the players do unusually well with their lines. Incidental sounds and flash-backs of Napoleon's thoughts serve to enhance this episode, which is alleged to have been inspired by a barber while he was shaving Mr. Caesar. The playwright thought how easy it would be for a barber to sever a jugular vein and thus make hisstory, so he went back a century and pinned it on Napoleon.John Ford, who, among a number of pictures, produced \\"The Iron Horse,\\" outlines this little story in an able fashion, and while it is filled with fictional ideas, they are none the less pleasing. The Little Corporal is perceived having his apéritif before some of his soldiers. An orderly brings a small chest, which when opened discloses a small bottle of wine and a glass. This particular Napoleon, in a most casual manner, gulps down a glass of the revivifier and then proceeds with the business of the day, not forgetting that he must, come what may, be shaved. The audience is well aware by that time of the revolutionary nature of the barber, for that individual has been filling the air with what he would do to Napoleon if he had him in his barber's chair.The barber's wife takes little stock in her husband's threats. She tells him that he has a customer and bids him hurry, for \\"the revolution can wait, but not so the customers.\\"While Napoleon is having his imperial chin lathered, the barber discourses upon his hatred of Napoleon. When the time comes to use the razor, Napoleon scoffs at the barber's chatter. He tells the barber that he knows Napoleon well and when the shaving is finished and the barber is perhaps suspicious of the identity of the soldier Napoleon asks the blowhard to attend to a few rough spots on his throat. Never did a barber have a better chance, but this one wilted. In the end Napoleon tells the barber, who has annoyed him by reading some of his verse, that he can forgive a revolutionist or a bad barber, but never a bad poet.It is a genuinely pleasing subject that is told in such a delectable fashion that the true Napoleon in the character survives. Mr. Mattieson makes a better Napoleon than many other actors have done. He is restrained and cool and his lines come forth with an agreeable naturalness. Mr. Reicner also succeeus in making the barber a real character. Little Phillipe de Lacy acts the rôle of the barber's son quite well","excerpt":"there is a good deal of sympathy and charm in those scenes where this boy salutes the soldier (Napoleon) who had given him a me???.This is another talking film that may win converts for this new type of entertainment.Clark and McCullough's audible comedy, \\"The Bath Between,\\" sent the audience into convulsions of laughter. It is the type of fun that may not be especially subtle, but which is sufficiently effective to make one chuckle at the dilemma of the two comic gentlemen, especially after Al, the strong-arm husband, puts in his appearance. One of the comedy team discovers himself in the unfortunate position of being locked in the bathroom while his companion is sound asleep.??? delivers a stirring conception of Tcaikovsky's \\"1812.\\" Mr. Rothafel's \\"Tableaux Napoleon\\" are beautifully devised.On the Movietone news reel are sound pictures of the Mount Etna eruption, the Lord Mayor's procession in London and Robert Benchley's sketch dealing with the carving of a turkey and trying to restrain both his temper and the bird.

THE WORLD OF CHARLES ADDAMS (Knopf, $30) is a big, handsome book of his cartoons, lovingly gathered by his widow, Tee Addams. It is, of course, both hilarious and genuinely frightening, and -- be warned -- no self-respecting coffee table will henceforth tolerate being without one. The publishers have been wise enough to give virtually each work of art a full page to itself so that it has plenty of room from which to spring","excerpt":"there is a lavish sampling of Addams's New Yorker covers printed in full color, and the book has been given an affectionate and informative introduction by Wilfrid Sheed. The cartoons are essentially presented in the order in which they were created, and the more scholarly may find the actual dates of their publication in The New Yorker listed at the back of the book. We can see Addams (1912-88) moving through his very early line work and then arriving at the rich tones and enormous complexities of the wash drawings he created from the 30's to the early 50's. These drawings have a marvelous dark beauty and are rendered with a scrupulous attention to detail that would have done credit to the illuminator of a medieval manuscript. The rest of the collection carries us through the varyingly looser techniques Addams employed in his later work. From start to finish all seems as fresh as if the water used to shade the overcast skies and cobwebbed corners were still damp. My only complaint is the usual one during recollections of Addams's work: the book is missing the cartoon I cherish most! My most beloved one shows one of his desperately lonely little girls exhaustedly skipping rope in the very small hours of a steamy Manhattan summer night somewhere back in the late 30's or early 40's, and she's chanting out her ten thousand thousandth jump.

Trees arch overhead, and the road winds around three lakes and through 13,000 acres of hilly terrain in the Ramapo mountains that the 1,000 residents call home.\\n\\nMeredith and Rustin Billingsley had never heard of Tuxedo Park until last year, when they decided to move from their SoHo loft because they were expecting a baby.\\n\\n\\"I saw ads for Tuxedo Park and it sounded historic,\\" said Mr. Billingsley, 38 years old, who runs ClassicWorks, a not-for-profit acting company in Manhattan, \\"but I didn't think we could afford it.\\"\\n\\nAfter looking at dozens of houses the Billingsleys came back to Tuxedo Park and decided they didn't want to leave.\\n\\n\\"We wanted to stay within an hour of Manhattan,\\" said Mrs. Billingsley, whose work as a dietician frequently takes her into the city. \\"And this is a bargain when you start looking at what your money will buy in other areas.\\"\\n\\nTheir home, built in 1886, sits on six acres. For the three-story, 7,000-square-foot house, the Billingsleys paid $525,000.Like most homes here, theirs is tied to the history of Tuxedo Park itself. \\n\\nIn 1885, Pierre Lorillard returned to the tract of wilderness around Tuxedo Lake that his grandfather had acquired 70 years before, intent on building a retreat from the pressures of running P. Lorillard and Company, the tobacco giant. With 20 friends, he created a hunting and fishing getaway named the Tuxedo Club, for the lake at its heart (\\"Tuxedo\\" is believed to be Algonquin for \\"clear flowing water.\\")\\n\\nBruce Price, who later lived in Tuxedo Park, designed the club and its facilities as well as several cottages and the gatehouse. His daughter, Emily Post, one of this century's first authorities on etiquette, also lived here. \\n\\nAccording to \\"A Brief History of the Town of Tuxedo,\\" by Doris Crofut, \\"a large representation of New York Society\\" was present when Tuxedo Park opened on June 1, 1886.\\n\\n\\"They were met by carriages and wagonettes painted green and gold, the club colors,\\" she wrote. \\"Game wardens dressed in green and gold with Tyrolean hats were seen along the roadside, as well as tame deer.\\"\\n\\nDeer still roam the woods, and the myriad styles of houses -- from Tudor to Spanish -- give the landscape charm and surprise. Walls built by Italian stonemasons a century ago thread through the hills.\\n\\nCindy Van Schaack, the president of Towne and Country Properties, which handles much Tuxedo Park realty, emphasizes the unusual character of the property. \\"You can buy a renovated carriage house that has three or four bedrooms for $295,000,\\" said Mrs. Van Schaack, an 18-year resident who lives here with her husband and two children, \\"or you can buy an original French chateau with 27,000 square feet for $2.9 million -- and then there's everything in between.\\" \\n\\nThere are about 350 houses in Tuxedo Park, each unique and impossible to categorize. The prominent architects who designed the big houses overlooking Tuxedo Lake, including Frederick Law Olmsted and the firm of McKim, Mead and White, also designed the carriage houses and potting sheds.\\n\\nToday, those semiprecious architectural gems have been refurbished by new owners, often younger couples buying their first house, said Mrs. Van Schaack. \\n\\nThe Tuxedo Park Zoning and Architectural Review boards carefully restricts the development or enhancement of property. Tuxedo Park has no condominiums, no apartments and no commercial development","excerpt":"there is a minimum four-acre zoning for all new houses.\\n\\nTHOUGH new construction is rare and available lots are hard to come by, six houses were built in the last year, and Mrs. Van Schaack said that the market has been stable. \\"There has been no drop in the value of property,\\" she said. \\"The market is a little soft, but Tuxedo Park never got over-inflated the way New York City did.\\" \\n\\nPenelope Naylor Teitelbaum, a writer, plans to buy or renovate another house in Tuxedo Park as soon as she and her husband, David, sell The Breezes, their home of five years. \\"There is a certain magic of architecture here,\\" she said, \\"and it's private.\\" \\n\\nSince becoming an incorporated village in 1953, Tuxedo Park no longer has restrictions on who can live here. But membership in the Tuxedo Club -- \\"a sportsman's paradise,\\" says Philip Mengel, co-chairman of the membership committee -- is by invitation only; about half the Tuxedo Park residents are members, and nonresidents may be sponsored as well. \\n\\nCornelius J. J. Madera, the Mayor of Tuxedo Park, who is serving a second two-year term, said that a broad spectrum of people take an active part in the community -- \\"artists, singers, investment bankers, they all chip in.\\" \\n\\nThe senior vice-president and principal owner of the ShopRite supermarket chain, Mr. Madera is typical of the new breed of Tuxedoites. Married with three daughters, he has been active in the community and the school since he moved here in 1981. \\n\\nThe Tuxedo Park School, pre-kindergarten through grade 9, is open to nonresidents. Of the 170 students, about half are day students from Bergen County or boarders from upstate New York. Tuition ranges from $2,500 in the lower grades to about $8,000 in the upper grades.\\n\\nTuxedo Park residents also can sendtheir children to the public schools in Tuxedo, though not many do.

Proulx, who is 70, writes in ''Story to Screenplay'' that ''Brokeback Mountain'' began to take shape early in 1997, in a Wyoming bar. She noticed, she writes, ''an older ranch hand, maybe in his late 60's, obviously short on the world's luxury goods.'' This man wasn't paying attention to the women in the room, but rather to the young cowboys shooting pool. ''Maybe he was following the game,'' Proulx writes, ''maybe he knew the players, maybe one was his son or nephew, but there was something in his expression, a kind of bitter longing, that made me wonder if he was country gay. Then I began to consider what it might have been like for him.'' Proulx is a fan of Ang Lee's movie. When she saw it, she continues in her essay, she had to confront ''the point that writers do not like to admit; in our time film can be more powerful than the written word.'' When an Associated Press reporter asked her if she'd ever be tempted to bring her two characters, Jack and Ennis, back in another story, she replied: ''They're not coming back. There's no way.

And it is scenic. This winding ribbon of road that traverses some of eastern Connecticut's most historic towns, past wooded hills, pastures and apple orchards, is the most recent, as well as the longest, route to receive the prize designation from the State Transportation Department.\\n\\nToday's Route 169, stretching 38 miles north from Norwich to the Massachusetts border, is essentially the same as the old Norwich and Woodstock Turnpike, which was incorporated in 1801 and operated as a toll road until 1846. Long before, Indian foot trails followed much the same course and were trod, some local historians say, by 17th-century settlers as they made their way to what is now Woodstock.\\n\\nOver the years commerce and industry intruded very little on the highway, but recently some people feared that development might bring unwelcome change. In 1989, when the legislature adopted a law calling for designation of some state roads as scenic if they possessed \\"significant natural or cultural features,\\" local residents seized the chance to preserve the character of their highway.\\n\\n\\"The minute I heard about the legislation, I said, 'This is it,' \\" said Elizabeth Wood, president of the Woodstock Historical Society, who helped write the application for scenic status. \\nVanishing Countryside\\n\\n She recalled traveling another road that was \\"bordered by unbelievably beautiful farmland,\\" until \\"it began to get eaten up by development,\\" she said. \\"Soon the countryside just disappeared. I was afraid it would happen here, too.\\"\\n\\nWith other members of the Association of North Eastern Connecticut Historical Societies, Mrs. Wood helped conduct a study required by the law, identifying historic towns and buildings, scenic vistas and traditional uses of the land. The group had only one previous model to follow: a three-mile stretch of Route 234 in Stonington, the first to be selected under the new legislation. \\n\\nEleven other roads have since been chosen, none even half the length of the 32.1-mile section of Route 169 that was accepted. Representatives of the three agencies involved in the decision -- the State Transportation, Environmental Protection and Economic Development Departments -- evidently agreed with the applicants' statement that \\"the catalogue of delights to be found along the road is endless.\\"\\n\\nThese include bucolic scenes like weathered farmsteads, splashes of wildflowers, old stone walls and unpolluted streams in towns like Canterbury, Brooklyn, Pomfret and Woodstock, all settled around 1700 or earlier. Each community has its traditional green and stately church and a bounty of architecture that recalls the 18th and 19th centuries.\\n\\nCanterbury is the site of the Prudence Crandall Museum, a Federal-style house in which Miss Crandall, a resolute young school mistress, attempted in 1833 to create an academy for black girls. Brooklyn boasts the first Unitarian Church in the state, a lofty serene structre built in 1771 as a Congregational meeting house. It became Unitarian 50 years later, after a schism among the members. Nearby is the equestrian statue erected in 1887 by the state to honor Israel Putnam, the general who commanded American forces at Bunker Hill and whose exploits are legendary in his native region.\\nInns and Restaurants\\n\\n Elegant Pomfret reached its zenith in the 1890's, when affluent New Yorkers came by railroad and established summer homes. Two private schools now help maintain a patrician appearance.\\n\\nWoodstock sits high on a hill, affording a good view of the area. Its academy, meeting house and vintage houses are typical of old New England. Roseland Cottage, a pink, Gothic-inspired 1846 mansion, draws sightseers from May until October.\\n\\nFor visitors the charm of the route is enhanced by several inns and bed and breakfasts as well as some restaurants and shops that offer picnics","excerpt":"there is also a selection of crafts and antiques shops, all housed in old buildings that have been tastefully adapted. Perhaps the only time the road gets crowded is in late summer, when two major fairgrounds come alive. Brooklyn and Woodstock both have held agricultural fairs since the mid-19th century, and the friendly rivalry continues.\\n\\n\\"I know of no place where there is so much original material still in place,\\" said Mrs. Wood, describing Route 169 as \\"a laboratory in American history.\\" Like others active in applying for the designation, she said she was pleased that the process brought people from the area's different sections together and made them realize they are part of each other's history. The next step, she said, is working toward creating historic districts along the road, to protect the architectural and historic legacy of the towns themselves.\\n\\n\\"The road legislation does not mean all that much in terms of restrictions on private property,\\" said Mrs. Wood. \\"It doesn't stop development.\\" \\n\\nBut it does promise that \\"any future alterations or improvement of the designated section of Route 169 shall respect the character of the road,\\" the State Transportation Commissioner, Emil H. Frankel, said in a news release. If his department wishes to widen or straighten the road, change the grade or remove trees, it must give public notice and review all written comments.\\n\\n\\"That's the only real protection the act gives scenic roads,\\" said Mrs. Wood. \\"Plus the advantage of the state's recognition.

JOHN S. WILSON Nichols's Notes    The Jazz Composers' Collective, \\"The Music of Herbie Nichols,\\" Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 995-1552. Herbie Nichols was an unusually promising pianist and composer who took part in jazz sessions at Monroe's Uptown House in Harlem in the late 1930's when the seeds of be-bop were being laid. Although technically on a par with the other musicians there, he felt uneasy in their company because of his lack of musical education. As a result, he got relatively few jobs and those he did get were not in his own style but in the swing manner of such jazz musicians as Illinois Jacquet, Lucky Thompson and Arnett Cobb. By the time he died, at 44 in 1963, he had not established an identity of his own and he has remained in obscurity, despite the fact that his playing was very readily communicative. His music will get a rare hearing in a concert tonight, played by a group that includes Ted Nash, Adam Kolker and John Schroeder on saxophones, Ron Horton on trumpet and fluegelhorn, Charlie Gordon on trombone, Frank Kimbrough on piano, Ben Monder on guitar, Ben Allison on bass, and Jeff Ballard, Tim Horner and Matt Wilson on drums.

It is a clown whose make-up is patchy, an aerial artist whose timing is faulty, a high-wire walker whose courage fails. Its pantomine may not confuse the enthusiast who saw the Leslie Bricuse-Anthony Newly musical on the stage. But others may find themselves groping for the light, the light of day outside the theater.The stage version of \\"Stop the World\\" was performed just short of 1,000 times in New York and London. The plot is familiar. It is a satirical fantasy, a cynical view of life improvised in a circus ring by a clown with a story to tell, the story of a little chap named Littlechap who burns with ambition to be rich, marries the boss's daughter, has several children and several extra-marital affairs, and ends as a titled politician (Lord Littlechap), but finds that by going all through life loving only himself, he has played the fool whose circus make-up of clown is tragically appropriate.It is good stuff, as the popularity of this musical has proved. But it doesn't begin to spin its magic in the screen version. Littlechap may have been a heel. But to stir the audience he must be a human heel who cries human tears. The audience should be able to feel some emotional involvement with him. The movie version never escapes the circus ring. It never comes to life.A good pair of scissors adroitly exercised would have helped. The prologue of the film was far too long. It would have been better not to delay the parade of familiar and good songs, by far the picture's strongest point. The ending could have been chopped. It went on and on and on, as if the performers, knowing they had failed, were too embarrassed to get off the stage without making at least one more try.Much may be made of the fact that this motion picture version of the stage musical is not really a motion picture version, but a duplication of a stage performance. It was filmed at the Lyric Theater in Hammersmith, London","excerpt":"there is an orchestra leader in the pit, an audience out front; the camera never wanders from the actuality of what could happen on the stage.But of course the camera has a versatility that no one anchored in a theater seat can approach. The close-ups and angle shots were imaginatively used by the director, Philip Saville.New Yorkers who saw the Broadway version with its co-author, Anthony Newley, playing Littlechap will find Tony Tanner a versatile Littlechap, but one whose versatility is not enough. Millicent Martin does not measure up to the extraordinary Anna Quayle of the original company. In fact the failure to synchronize Miss Martin's lip movements with the words when she is singing as Anya, Littlechap's Russian love, is shoddy workmanship, all but insulting to the audience.The enthusiast of the stage version will object to changing Littlechap's amorous attention to Ilse, a German domestic, to amorous attention to Ara, a Japanese domestic. He may also object to the fact that some of the bite had to be taken out of the original lyrics, for fear of offending.But principally, \\"Stop the World\\" fails because, just as Littlechap could not love, this film could not come alive.

In \\"The Oppenheim Family\\" the resemblance to life appears to be more than coincidental","excerpt":"there is an unequivocal solidity about the truncheons and boots of the Storm Troopers; an authentic flavor of uniformed mobocracy in the window-smashing demonstrations; names are named with a fine Soviet disregard for consular protests. Plainly, in the absence of better evidence, \\"The Oppenheim Family\\" (known as \\"The Oppermanns\\" in the novel by Lion Feuchtwanger) must be accepted as a document.To its documentary daring, in a time when a fact is still a fearsome thing in a movie script, the picture owes most of its interest and importance for contemporary New York, where Hitler at the moment is a greater celebrity than Henny Youngman. In fact, there is something ephemeral, almost opportunist, in the picture's approach, as if Mosfilm were deliberately exploiting one of our national weaknesses, in order to build up a valuta balance.The lack of genuine indignation, however, is partly compensated by a strangely appropriate effect of unreality, as if the actors were characters playing parts in a nightmare, in which none of them can quite believe. The picture's most memorable features are those of the brutal Nazi Storm Troopers in close-up—obviously mental types which Aldous Huxley would classify as Beta Minus.Members of \\"The Oppenheim Family\\" are almost purely symbols, and incongruously enough, whether by accident or satirical design, the young Jewish hero is the most Nordic-looking. The literary professor who spouts party idiotology to his classes, and ultimately drives the lad to suicide, has what racial theorists might regard as a conspicuously \\"non-Aryan\\" appearance. The persecution and heroism of the German Communists, though a parallel theme, is handled with positively heroic restraint.

But there is an unmistakable resemblance to the Hitchcock melodrama in the picture's rapid direction, urbanity and cleverness. Albert de Courville, its director, obviously has studied the Hitchcock technique and has mastered it in its simpler phases. That is entirely to his credit. When he has completed his course and added originality to his borrowed repertory he may produce a successor to \\"The Thirtynine Steps.\\"Meanwhile we need not regard \\"Seven Sinners\\" with the familiar jaundiced eye merely because some one has made extravagant claims for it. On its own merits it is a crisp, humorous and deftly turned murder mystery in which Hollywood's Edmund Lowe and Constance Cummings lead an English caste through an exciting investigation of the strange case of the carnival corpse, the Nice-Paris express wreck and the vague purposes of a reform group called the Pilgrims of Peace.The tale begins with the carnival in Nice, where Mr. Lowe, as an American private detective, is to meet Miss Cummings — representative of an insurance agency — and accompany her to Scotland to recover some missing jewels, if possible. One night, reaching his hotel in a carnival glow, he stumbles into the wrong room and finds the body of a bearded man slumped over a table. He goes for aid and when he returns, followed by the skeptical management, the corpse has disappeared and the room has been restored to perfect order. The detective is advised to sleep it off.That night he and the decorative insurance agent entrain on the Nice-Paris express. There is a wreck and, crawling from it, Mr. Lowe comes once again upon the body of the bearded man. An address in Paris has been penciled on the dead man's cuff","excerpt":"there is an unusual cuff-link. With these clues and the conviction that the train wreck was engineered to hide the earlier murder, Mr. Lowe wagers $5,000 with a French assistant Prefect of Police that he will be the first to solve the crimes. The investigation is ingenious, the quarry interesting, the motives strange and the dnouement surprising. One has no right to ask for more.Mr. Lowe is as ingratiating as ever in the detective rôle and Miss Cummings pleasantly light-hearted as his Dr. Watson. Elsewhere you will enjoy Thorny Bourdelle as the French police official, Henry Oscar as a dubious character, Mark Lester as an amusing caricature of an English constable, Anthony Holles as a subdued hotel clerk and O. B. Clarence as a boisterously sentimental registrar.

What drives the ''serious'' collector is often a subject for discussion - usually among serious collectors themselves or among their put-upon spouses, who are weary of the never-ending demand for more space.   In a lively book about records and recording - ''The Recording Angel,'' to be published in October by McGraw-Hill - the author, Evan Eisenberg, expresses the hunger neatly this way: ''The buying is what counts, which is one reason why the record buyer is insatiable. The desire to buy does not always coincide with the desire to hear music. If I want to hear music, surely there is something on my shelf or on the radio that can satisfy me; if I want to hear a certain record I don't have, perhaps I can borrow it from a friend or a library. The desire to buy, on the other hand, explodes when my wallet reaches a certain critical mass, or when I'm anxious, or when I've worked hard at something idiotic and want a reward.''

He worked in every possible musical medium and style","excerpt":"there is even an opera composed when he was a teen-ager. The Liszt catalogue contains a bit of everything, and an enormous amount is rarely heard today -except on records. In particular, recently, there have been new releases of his organ music, orchestral music, sacred choral music and songs.   Liszt's reputation as a composer has gone through some curious shifts of fashion. In the 19th century, he was known as a flamboyant virtuoso, torn in his private life between sensuality and Catholic mysticism. When Romantic display went out of fashion in our century, so did Liszt - except, of course, in the cloistered world of the piano recital.   Yet while many of Liszt's works fell from popular favor, his reputation waxed in other quarters, especially in Hungary and among modernist intellectuals. Liszt never founded a true Hungarian compositional school, partly because he was too much the cosmopolitan (he never learned Hungarian) and more because his fixation on gypsy music was superseded by the researches of Bartok and Kodaly into indigenous Hungarian folk music. But the Hungarians have still recorded his work indefatigably on the state Hungaroton label.

The secret is in a genre of film which is all the rage now—a light, gay operatta, always extravagant as to plot and very catchy as to tunes, with a strong farcical tinge that ends up by sending one home in high good humor with a melodious refrain running through one's head.This is not quite the type of audible film which blazed up and disappeared in the United States about three years ago. Here it is a return to the true style of the Viennese operetta, though in a French setting. As a matter of fact, though there were such pictures here before, what really started the public vogue in Paris was the French version of the German production, \\"The Congress Dances,\\" played here under the title of \\"Le Congrés s'Amuse.\\" The mark of that picture is to be noted again and again on the screens in Paris.\\"Il Est Charmant.\\"Here in France the vogue for this type of picture was started in a measure by the Paramount Company with its productions at Joinville. The biggest hit in Paris now is one of theirs: \\"Il Est Charmant\\" (\\"He Is Charming\\"). It is a picture which has received extravagant praise from all critics—far more than the usual perfunctory and labored laudation which the greater part of the French press gives to all pictures regardless of whether they are good or bad.The tunes Raoul Moretti composed for the story are already being heard all over Paris. It is a light and melodious score of unfailing resourcefulness, interpreted with skill and charm by Henry Garat, one of France's most popular young screen comedians—the czar of the French version of \\"The Congress Dances\\"—and Meg Lemonnier. There is plenty of dancing","excerpt":"there is farce comedy (interpreted by Dranem, a veteran of the French stage who here makes a successful début on the talking screen). There are, in fact, all the tricks and turns of the standard operetta with, incidentally, many of its faults.However, from the enthusiasm with which the populace is greeting this picture, one must believe that it is a good expression of French taste. It is so obviously what they want that Paramount announced this past week that it is getting ready to do some more.One is almost inclined to forget the plot in telling about the picture, for this one happens to be even more extravagant than an operetta is supposed to be. It is about a rich young scapegrace, Jacques d'Ombreval, whose dissipations prevent him from passing his law examinations. His uncle sends him to a little provincial town to exercise the profession of notary and he takes with him not only all his wild friends from the Latin Quarter, but also, as master clerk, a lovely young woman who had passed her examinations with the brilliance he lacked. After turning the town topsy-turvy he ends up by marrying his charming assistant.Needless to say, the plot is simply an excuse for the music and dancing and gayety, which go on without interruption. The chief exponent of Terpsichore's art in the picture is Moussia, a young woman with an impudent face and a glorious body, who is one of the favorite cabaret artists of Paris. This is her début on the screen.All in all, Paramount spared nothing to please the public, and the public certainly is pleased. Not that \\"Il Est Charmant\\" is the only hit of its sort here now, or even, in the writer's opinion, the best. The prize would seem to belong to Pathé-Natan's \\"Paris-Mediterranée,\\" a picture as amusing, as melodious and as charming as one could expect an operetta to be. It is the first big production of the young director Joë May, from whom great things may be expected in the future if this picture may be taken as a criterion.M. May also has a cast perfectly suited to his needs. There is the adorable Annabella, one of the most gifted young screen actresses in France, whose next picture, which she is going to play in French, English, German and Hungarian versions, will be seen in New York. There is Jean Murat, playing the part of an Englishman so perfectly that he completely fooled at least one English spectator. There is Duvallès, making a screen début which has immediately placed him in the front rank of French comedians. And lastly, there is José Noguero playing the part of a voluble, excitable, acrobatic suitor to perfection.Viennese Compositions.The music for this picture is by a Viennese, Granischdaetten, and is no less catchy or delightful than the score of \\"Il Est Charmant.\\"Unfortunately for Joë May, his picture starts off with an awkward \\"Promenade Dansante\\" by Annabella, deliberately copying the gracious, airy dance of Lilian Harvey in \\"The Congress Dances,\\" which all the critics here immediately pounced upon for denunciation. In fact, it prevented the picture from receiving the critical acclaim it deserved, although every one was loud in his praises of the rest of the picture.The story is about Solange Pascaud, a salesgirl, who has answered the advertisement of an accountant desiring a companion (a platonic one, the screen being what it is) to drive down to the Riviera with him in a flivver he won in a lottery. At the place of the appointment Solange, by a lucky mischance, mistakes a rich young English lord, Harry Kingsdale, for the accountant. The Englishman gladly falls in with the supposed arrangement, and the rest of the picture is taken up with the drive to Cannes, the amusing events of the trip, and the inevitable discovery by Solange, with the equally inevitable proposal of marriage.An Excellent Show.It is all perfectly charming, where Annabella and Jean Murat are concerned, and extremely hilarious when Duvallès and José Noguero are in view. One cannot imagine, in fact, a more delightful evening's entertainment.The closest thing to \\"The Congress Dances\\" that Paris is seeing now, however, is \\"La Fille et le Garcon\\" (\\"The Girl and the Boy\\") with the ravishing Lilian Harvey surpassing by far even that previous performance. This is another of those bi- or trilingual productions. The French version is wholly French as to cast (except for Lilian Harvey), and can be viewed without any thought of being anything else, despite its German director, Wilhelm Thiele. The male star is once again Henry Garat, who played opposite Lilian Harvey in the French version of her previous picture, and who is no less charming this time than he is in the picture of that title discussed at the beginning of this article.Members of the entertainment unit of \\"Small's Paradise,\\" a Harlem Negro night club, will take part in a musical \\"short\\" entitled \\"Smash Your Baggage,\\" in process of production at the Vitaphone Brooklyn studio.

In terms for the layman she suffers from a compulsion to \\"let me tell you, my dear, about my operation,\\" and she has been telling about it regularly for the last two years.Miss Steele, as we have had little opportunity to forget, was the young American imprisoned in Germany for four months in 1934 on charges of espionage. Deported finally, after the intervention of the American Consulate, she returned here safely, fed the news columns and syndicates for several weeks, wrote a few magazine articles, gathered her remaining memories into a book and now—at the Globe—is assisting in a pictorial reenactment of the tragedy called \\"I Was a Captive in Nazi Germany.\\"For all the elaborate precautions of the film's makers to ward off (what we are led to believe\\" would be) Hitler's retaliation — the cast, with the exception of Miss Steele, remaining anonymous, and the producer, Malvina Productions, being just a Hollywood Jane Doe — the picture is less an exposé of Nazi persecution than a mirror for Miss Steele's rather amazing unsophistication. This inference we had drawn when first she began writing about her German experiences","excerpt":"there is no doubt about it any longer. A dupe of an obvious spy ring and an equally obvious Communist agitator, she plunged blindly into an elephant trap and when caught proclaimed that she was an American citizen.This is not to be interpreted as a columnar defense of Der Fuehrer's policies—of the racial persecution, book-burning and other matters which the picture has incorporated through the courtesy of the newsreels—but there is some old saying about \\"when in Rome, don't laugh at Caesar,\\" and we find ourselves unable to sympathize unduly with Miss Steele for her treatment at Nazi hands.Now that we have alienated the League Against War and Fascism, we must add that the picture has been crudely produced and performed and falls into the common error of propaganda plays: that of attempting to make the enemy appear ridiculously black. There is too much need of a righteous denunciation of stupid despotism, bigotry and narrow nationalism to entrust the attack to amateurs and the issue to an Isobel Steele's, resentment at an understandablée, if undeserved, imprisonment.

It may not be a new story, but it makes a highly amusing entertainment and it is splendidly staged and efficiently acted by the supporting cast, which includes the vivacious Lupe Velez.Captain Innocencio of El Suelo, Mexico, is not a man to scoff at. One may ask who is the chief of police of the town and learn that he is Captain Innocencio. It is also on record that he is the Mayor, the prosecuting attorney, the judge and the Lord High Executioner when it pleases him to snuff out a life. As a judge he appears to have studied Solomon. He gives a couple a divorce one second and the next remarries them.Lupe Velez impersonates the fractious but charming Lolita, foster daughter of the affable Luther Farley. It is with Lolita that Innocencio is in love. He brings her dresses and finery, which he has stolen","excerpt":"there is no harm in that to him, particularly when Lolita is delighted with the gift. But gifts or no gifts. Lolita is not precisely infatuated with Innocencio. She expects somebody else, especially after the crossed forks have fallen to the floor, for the girl is told by a maid that they mean that the King of Hearts is coming to the house. Brag as Innocencio will that he is the King of Hearts, Lolita is rather dubious. She prefers to bide her time.Then out of the storm there comes a flier, who in trying to make a landing crashes into a tree and is carried unconscious into Farley's home. Innocencio attends to the injured American airman, but had he suspected that this gringo would turn out to be the King of Hearts, he might not have been so kind. The injured man recovers his health, but he suffers from amnesia and therefore does not know his name.At one turn of the tale the redoubtable Innocencio decides to rid himself of his American rival in the easiest way—by having him backed up against a wall and shot. He braves the wrath of Lolita in giving the command. He is deaf to the pleas of his old pal, Justin Bailey, and he refuses to hearken to reason expressed by Farley. The intruder from the air must be shot. That's all there is to it. But, as that is not the way such stories are apt to end, it is a foregone conclusion that the estimable American airman will be saved in the nick of time, which, of course, happens.Melvyn Douglas does good work as the aviator. George Barbier is thoroughly pleasing as Farley. But the brunt of the story is borne by Leo Carrillo and Miss Velez and with their spirited encounters and bright and colorful dialogue they succeed in making the utmost of their rôles.As the stage show, there is \\"Joy Jamboree,\\" with George Jessel, Lillian Roth, Bing Crosby, Burns and Allen and others. Leo Carrillo Appears as an Ingratiating Mexican Bad Man in a Film of an Old Play."},{"year":"1930","title":"In these days when practically all the ladies are loved by the heroes of countless battles, the advent of another war picture is the signal for a discontented sigh. So it was that when \\"The Dawn Patrol\\" opened yesterday, the peaceful souls in the Winter Garden expected the worst. They were disappointed. Instead of giving them an hour and ten minutes of sentiment, rose leaves and toy balloons, the management casually presented what in the olden times would have been called a melodrama. War pictures as a rule do not bear that title. But whatever the name, \\"The Dawn Patrol\\" met with approval.The picture has as an underlying motive that same theory first presented by Laurence Stallings and Maxwell Anderson in the raucus whimsicalities, the deep purposes of \\"What Price Glory?\\" It is the futility of war. In \\"The Dawn Patrol\\" the motive forms a background, one dressed with the roar of airplane motors, sky raids, lonely rides through the clouds, battle and destruction. There are no bands","excerpt":"there is no heroine dressed in a manner to faintly suggest the crinoline days.The film maintains through a length that is somewhat great all its air of excitement that has suggested a melodrama. When planes are flying there are whole fleets in the sky at once; when guns are fired there are entire batteries. Finally, toward the end, Richard Barthelmess takes it upon himself to bomb a city. The explosion would have practically won the war. First National has spent its powder and shot lavishly—and \\"The Dawn Patrol\\" holds the interest.The aviation phases of the picture have been worked out with great detail. Scouts, who are up on such things, reported last evening that the spins, the flying sequences, the photographs taken from the air, have been done by experts in the trade. Save in one or two instances—obviously concessions to the great American legend—the air sectors have stressed the slightly ignored art of realism.But like all things that are human and thus fallible \\"The Dawn Patrol\\" goes astray occasionally. There is a singing-bee at headquarters, when all the aviators sit around with glasses and salute death somewhat in the traditional manner of Heidelberg. There is also a rescue of Mr. Barthelmess from behind the enemy line. This would look badly enough in print, it is quite incredible on the screen. But these emotional sideslips are not many.The story chiefly concerns Dick Courtney and Douglas Scott, friends and fellow aviators. Major Brand is their commander, and Courtney and he continually quarrel. Finally, the two fliers raid the camp of an enemy airplane fleet, practically destroying it. But when Courtney returns Brand is promoted and leaves his job as a curse to the aviator. Sending so many men to their death preys on Courtney's mind, just as it did on Brand's.Eventually, Scott's brother appears, is sent on a flight by Courtney and is killed. The long friendship between the two men is broken. Then a raid is ordered on a munition dump. Courtney asks for volunteers and accepts Scott—though the assignment is certain death. The squadron commander then puts his friend to sleep with whisky and goes himself. He is killed. The last scene of the picture shows Scott as the new officer in charge.Both Mr. Barthelmess and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. do well as Courtney and Scott, respectively. And neither is an easy part. Neil Hamilton is Major Brand and James Finlayson has the rôle of the field sergeant. Scott's younger brother, Gordon, is played by William Janney.

Of the more than 14,000 Americans diagnosed with AIDS as of mid-October, fewer than 1,000 were women.

Ramiro Zaragoza, the young lawyer in charge, hired 33 inspectors, outfitted them in green windbreakers and began training them to take on the malfeasants. In Mexico City, officials announced a new dawn in the country's fight against pollution, new proof that if Mexico was allowed to join Canada and the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement it would not sacrifice its environment to attract business across the border. Toxic Legacy of Decades    But in Tijuana it was not that easy. Other agencies would not lend their files on the city's 700 industrial plants, officials in and outside the enforcement office say. Laboratory studies could not be done for lack of equipment or supplies. Then, for five months and without explanation, paychecks did not arrive. Mr. Zaragoza says he is as determined as ever, but only five of his inspectors are still on the job.   \\"We've been bluffing,\\" he said, sitting behind his desk and doing his best to smile. \\"If they knew how few people we had, they would just laugh at us.\\"   Faced with the toxic legacy of four decades of almost unregulated industrialization and desperate to win approval for the pending trade agreement, Mexico has taken extraordinary measures in the last few years to strengthen its environmental controls.   On Friday, Mexico, Canada and the United States also announced supplemental accords intended to insure the enforcement of Mexican labor and environmental standards under the agreement, which would eliminate most barriers to trade and investment among the three countries.   Supporters of the trade pact say the side accords will force compliance by investing three-nation labor and environment commissions with the power to impose fines and trade sanctions as penalties of last resort against Mexican violators. The proposed arbitration process is complicated and long, however, and many environmentalists emphasize that it will ultimately be up to the Mexican Government to see that its goal of rapid economic development for the country's 84 million people does not come at an enormous environmental cost. The Problem Is Huge    But despite hundreds of new inspectors, millions of dollars in environmental projects and many speeches by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari declaring Mexico's commitment to protecting the environment, even some in the Government acknowledge that the country has only started, somewhat haltingly, to confront a problem of staggering proportions.   \\"We have just begun to scratch the surface of what needs to be done,\\" said the director of the National Institute of Ecology, Sergio Reyes Lujan.   Mexican ecological laws are viewed by many environmentalists as good and getting better. But a close look at Government environmental programs suggests that those laws are being undermined for reasons that may persist despite the new threat of trade sanctions.   While new environmental inspectors have fanned out across Mexico, their work continues to be hampered by insufficient and uncertain resources, political considerations and, at least occasionally, by corruption. Where the Government has cracked down on polluting industries, it has barely started to follow up with alternatives for those put out of business or incentives for steady compliance. Glaring Lack of Services    Strategies to limit the use of hazardous materials or otherwise prevent pollution are almost unheard of. And the public disclosure of information about companies' environmental practices is almost unimaginable.   As officials evoke images of a vast consumer market with boundless opportunities for investment, Mexico's lack of basic environmental services is glaring: in the Valley of Mexico, home to the capital and some 16 million people, almost nine-tenths of the waste water still goes untreated, according to Government figures. For some 60,000 industrial companies, there is a single toxic-waste landfill. There are no commercial incinerators for toxic wastes.   Mr. Reyes, a blunt-spoken physicist who has led Mexico's environmental efforts since 1986, can recall an agency that performed no inspections, did not even measure the air in Mexico City and got its first computer when he borrowed it from his 21-year-old son.  He is astonished by \\"the rate of change,\\" a phrase that has become his public mantra. The Border The Boom Is Clear, So's the Blight    Public debate in the United States is being driven largely by the experience of the border, where Government promises of a better tomorrow have a long, bitter past. Here, the dangers have already been vivid for two decades, as Mexico has drawn hundreds of foreign-owned industrial plants, called maquiladoras, with tariff, tax and other incentives.   In Ciudad Juarez, the problems are as plain as the great brown banks of smog that drift across the Rio Grande into El Paso, Tex. Elsewhere, they are sometimes less visible but more frightening: In Brownsville, Tex., an inexplicably high incidence of babies who are delivered stillborn without brains has led people to suspect contamination from industries just across the border in Matamoros, where the same phenomenon has appeared.   One fear that American environmentalists draw from the industrial boom along the border is that freer trade will mean more traffic, more industry and thus more pollution. But that focus underscores how little the accord's potential impact has been studied and how narrowly it has been seen.   Some economists believe that the crush of industry along the border could actually diminish under the agreement. But scant attention has been paid to the possible environmental effects on the Mexican interior of new activity in areas like agriculture, mining and forestry.   The new \\"U.S.A.-style\\" dry-cleaning outlets popping up around Mexico City hint at the vast range of problems. Unlike American dry cleaners, which are closely monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, nearly all the Mexican operations dump their hazardous wastes in the trash, a franchise manager, Alberto Shamosh, said. He told of searching for months and then paying dearly to have a waste company from Guadalajara take away his chemical sludge.   Upholding the demands of some American environmental groups for a fuller accounting of the trade agreement's effects, a Federal judge ordered the Clinton Administration last month to provide a complete environmental impact assessment. The Administration has appealed the decision, which could delay carrying out the pact well beyond Jan. 1, when it is supposed to take effect. A ruling on the appeal is expected in late September.   Hoping to dispel pressure for such a study, the Bush Administration released a report last year dismissing the other major fear of American environmentalists: that a trade agreement might turn Mexico into a haven for industries trying to escape tougher environmental regulations to the north.   Environmental Protection Agency officials acknowledge that some furniture manufacturers, automobile paint shops and other businesses have already moved to Mexico for just this reason. They insist, though, that cheaper labor and lower environmental-regulation costs might defray the expense of relocation only for a tiny handful of industries that could be easily controlled. The Newcomers Laws Are Flouted, Reforms Touted    Tijuana is not convinced.   \\"They have come here from all over, saying they are going to invest, that they are going to help us,\\" said Maurilio Sanchez, a community organizer in Ejido Chilpancingo, a dusty sprawl of tarpaper and brick that sits just below a big maquiladora park on the city's outskirts. \\"But when it comes to complying with the ecological laws, they say they cannot speak Spanish.\\"    For the most part, Mr. Sanchez said, the authorities ignore him. But they have been paying more attention since March 8, when sewer openings in the neighborhood exploded and he led a clutch of firemen and inspectors to a waste recycling business in the industrial park.   Just as the posse arrived, the company's owner and two workers were pouring barrels of toxic chemicals down a sewer drain. Investigators concluded that they had been doing so for years.   By law, the foreign-owned plants are obliged to ship their hazardous wastes back out of Mexico for disposal. In practice, officials say, there is a flourishing traffic in waste-dumping. A United States Congressional study last year found that fewer than one-third of the plants even reported on their wastes as required and that the reports went virtually unchecked.   Compared with even two years ago, Mexican officials assert, their ability to track and control such problems has taken a giant leap forward.   At one point in 1991, according to Government figures, the country's environmental agency had seven inspectors assigned to 15,000 industries in Mexico City. Under the new agency set up last fall, the office of the Attorney General for Environmental Protection, inspections officially jumped from 1,380 in all of 1989 to 6,937 in the first four months of this year.   While many environmentalists consider those figures suspect, there is no dispute that tens of millions of dollars have been committed to new sewage treatment plants, new landfills, new air-quality monitoring programs. More than 200 new environmental regulations are being written or rewritten with the help of international consultants. The Inspectors Paltry Resources (And No Paycheck)    In their campaign to push the trade accord through the American Congress this fall, Mexican and American officials have promised to channel billions more dollars to clean up both sides of the 2,000-mile border. And World Bank officials say they will lend as much as $600 million to support Mexico's environmental projects and agencies over the next several years.   But to follow two conscientious young federal inspectors on their rounds is to wonder about the effectiveness of the new force.   Puttering up Tijuana's hills in a Volkswagen bug, the inspectors -- Aidee Solano, clad in her green windbreaker and jeans, and Carlos Padilla, clad in just the jeans -- make their way to Bronzart S.A., a maker of bronze statuettes that moved in eight months ago from Southern California.   They tell the plant manager they simply want to take a look around, see the manufacturing process, check on the disposal of wastes.   \\"Just like in Los Angeles,\\" he says, \\"right?\\"   But after that welcome comparison, the manager indicates that he expected things to be a little different. Unlike in California, he has not bothered to clean out his waste water or have it treated. He is not sure what to do with the refuse from his smelting operation, he says, so it is piled up in a big mound behind the plant.   Shouting over the roar of machines, Miss Solano, who studied biology in college, questions a supervisor about the chemicals in the big drums. She asks for and receives information on each, but does not bother with samples","excerpt":"there is no laboratory to perform the analysis.   After five months without a paycheck, it seems heroic that the inspectors show up for work at all. In similar straits, two inspectors in the Ciudad Juarez office were recently dismissed after complaints that they unsuccessfully solicited big bribes at a local engine plant.    The head of the Juarez office was dismissed as well. But according to some Mexican and American environmental officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, his more serious failing may have been to push hard for inspections against the wishes of superiors afraid of angering local businessmen on the eve of a national presidential campaign.   Government officials denied that charge. They do not dispute, however, that the minister in charge of development programs and environmental affairs, Luis Donaldo Colosio, is considered a leading contender for the governing party's nomination and many of his subordinates campaign intensely, if quietly, on his behalf.  The Prospects Some Pray the Pact Will Bring Converts    Much as they have complained about the shortcomings of Mexican enforcement, many environmentalists acknowledge that more rigorous inspection of manufacturing plants is only one of the needed improvements in the country's environmental controls. \\"The question is whether, when the factories reopen, anything has really changed,\\" J. Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club, said in an interview in Washington.   Among the statistics that Salinas Administration officials routinely hand out, there is no count of follow-up inspections. Efforts are under way to make industries pay for their own waste treatment, and in what supporters of the trade agreement hail as a sign of the environmental cooperation it will encourage, Mexican officials and Los Angeles County prosecutors in June forced an American company to pay $2.5 million to clean up lead wastes from the battery-recycling plant it operated outside Tijuana.   But for now, pollution-prevention efforts are almost nonexistent, and incentive-based solutions to specific pollution problems are just getting off the drawing board.   In a 1991 study often quoted by Mexican officials, two Princeton University economists, Gene M. Grossman and Alan B. Krueger, conclude that \\"economic growth tends to alleviate pollution problems once a country's per capita income reaches about $4,000 to $5,000\\" -- Mexico's level now.   To many Mexican and American environmentalists, the study, prepared for a conference sponsored by the Mexican trade ministry, smacks of wishful thinking. But if changing attitudes is more complex a matter than the average amount of money in people's pockets, more and more American environmentalists have come to support the trade pact on the ground that it might strengthen Mexicans' environmental awareness along with their economy.   Just across from El Paso, where the pressure is building for binational solutions to the air-pollution problem, a brickmaker in Ciudad Juarez, Pedro Gonzalez, lent support for this thesis. He was describing the Government's insistence that he stop burning tires and sawdust in his kiln and start burning propane gas.   \\"The truth is, all of this is happening because the gabachos are pressuring us,\\" he said of the move toward cleaner fuels, using slang for Americans. \\"But we have families, too.

Instead you will find a prodigy of moderation: a mannerly collaboration of a temperate director, a restrained script, an orderly cast. It adds up, we are pleased to report, to a singularly likable picture.Mr. Jerome, as you probably remember, once forgot he was a humorist and, giving way to an \\"idle fancy,\\" wrote a serious allegorical drama which was presented in London as \\"The Passing of the Third Floor Back\\" in 1908. In it he reduced the world to a shabby-genteel boarding house in Bloomsbury Place, and under its roof he assembled a dozen lodgers, each representing in his way a typical segment of humanity. Under various human names they stood for arrogance, greed, hypocrisy, cowardice, timidity, vanity, helplessness, selfishness, &c. They bickered, persecuted, lied, deceived, loved and cheated one another.And then a Stranger came to the door—a sad-eyed, gentle, kindly man—and asked for lodgings. There was one vacant room, on the third floor back, and, accepting it, the Stranger sought indirectly to create a new spirit among his fellow lodgers.It was an involved skein of human affairs the Stranger tried to untangle. There was the problem of the girl whose parents were urging her into a marriage with the complacent, lecherous self-made man, Mr. Wright. There was the painted lady, fighting off age with cosmetics and sincere emotions with bitterness. There was the household drudge, almost ready to yield to the one chance of escape from ugliness. There was the young architect who had begun to surrender his dreams, and the young pianist whose talent was being sacrificed to commercialization.In telling this fable, the producers have been fortunate in their possession of a cast which etched character clearly, yet did not so blindly follow the allegorical pattern as to become caricature. In the days when Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson was playing the rôle of the Stranger the play probably was considered his. Now, even with Conrad Veidt's sensitive and restrained performance, \\"The Passing of the Third Floor Back\\" is not a one-man show. Most impressive of the players, perhaps, is Rene Ray as the slavey, but in the general curtain call there must be an appreciative salute, too, for Frank Cellier as Mr. Wright and Beatrix Lehmann as the caustic painted lady.

For here, after quite a career, is the much-mentioned picture which was made in France and Algeria some five years ago but which had been withheld until now from release in this country by Walter Wanger, who bought the American rights and the story as the basis for his memorable \\"Algiers\\" of three years back. And, for all the delay—or perhaps because of it—\\"Pepe le Moko\\" turns out to be an item well worth the waiting, the most distinguished \\"new\\" French film in months and months.Comparison with Mr. Wanger's \\"Algiers\\" is, of course, inescapable, since the two pictures tell substantially the same story in pretty much the same way. But, in one essential respect, the original has an incomparable advantage over the Hollywood-made imitation: it is a rawedged, realistic and utterly frank exposition of a basically evil story, while Mr. Wanger's version was a romantic and necessarily cautious retelling of the same. The fact that \\"Pepe le Moko\\" has skinned past the New York censors but has failed to get a Hays office seal by a long shot—or rather, by several close-ups and large chunks of dialogue—is sufficient comment upon the reasons why.Don't get the idea, however, that \\"Pepe le Moko\\" is a risque film. Rather it is the plain-spoken and honestly factual account of a Parisian crook's exile in the vicious and sordid Casbah of Algiers, that notorious area of corruption and native depravity from which he is eventually drawn to his doom by love for a woman. All the filthiness and vice of the Casbah are impressively shown in the film","excerpt":"there is no question at all about the ruthless wickedness of Pepe, and the woman who finally lures him into the open is obviously the mistress of another man.But the very frankness of the picture is the secret of its power and distinction, for the quality of the melodrama is immeasurably enhanced thereby and the pathos of the ironic ending is given more subtle point. Likewise the manner in which M. Duvivier directed it for sharp and unadorned reality imbues it with a firmness to be found only in films which call spades by their names.Consequently, Jean Cabin's tough, unsentimental performance of the title role is much more credible and revealing than Charles Boyer's sadeyed mooning as Pepe in \\"Algiers\\"; Mireille Balin is indeed more authoritative as a practical femme fatale than was Hedy Lamarr, and Line Noro certainly looks much more the part of a cast-off Algerian mistress than did Sigrid Gurie. In the supporting roles, too, Lucas Gridoux combines cunning, lack of scruple and a slick face to perfection as a native police inspector; Charpin makes a properly deceptive informer, and Gabriel Gabrio, Saturnin Fabre and Dalio breathe life into other characters. Well-written and not too many English subtitles assist those patrons unfamiliar with the language.Without criticizing \\"Algiers,\\" which was an exciting film in its own right, it can be fairly said that \\"Pepe le Moko\\" tells the same story more trenchantly and with decidedly more true flavor. For, after all, it was made in a France which wasn't too squeamish about facts—the sort of facts, anyhow, which it contains.

It is, however a signal first of a series of pictures which will be shown at the Roxy, in the Radio City Music Hall and other leading cinemas here within the next few months. As such it is a definite challenge to Hollywood.Lest all this fanfare be mistaken for a token of complete surrender to the Roxy film, it must be noted that \\"Chu Chin Chow\\" has its faults.The story, the familiar one of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, is overlong in its telling, running for a bit more than an hour and a half. When the print arrived here its screening time was an hour and fifty-two minutes. Despite the cuts, a few scenes still are draggy. The photography is not as expert as would be encountered in a Hollywood work of similar scope. The sound is faulty in spots, with whole lines of dialogue lost either through technical flaws or, possibly, a New Yorker's difficulty in understanding British intonation.But there is no fault with the cast, with the music (the original score by Frederic Norton is kept intact), or with the singers. Fritz Kortner, one of Germany's best stage and screen stars, is a brilliant Abu Hassan, the leader of the robber band that preys upon the merchants of Baghdad. George Robey, popular English comedian, although a stranger to these shores, is a lovable and laughable Ali Baba. Anna May Wong as the slave, Laurence Hanray as the greedy Kasim—there is no need of mentioning them all.In many respects, the picture provides an interesting basis for comparison with the Hollywood product. One cannot escape wondering how the same theme might have been treated by De Mille, von Sternberg or even Busby Berkeley. And it is no reflection on them to say that \\"Chu Chin Chow\\" is refreshing because it is so unlike the picture they would have made of it. Its love interest is definitely subordinated","excerpt":"there is no self-conscious attempt at photographic \\"effects\\"; the revel scenes, be they in robber cave or Baghdad palace, are quaint in their comparative restraint.Instead, the film is pretty much what it was meant to be—a comic operetta. And, for color and excitement, those who remember the fairy tale will find a convincing model of the mountain retreat with its \\"Open, Sesame\\" password, a few red-blooded battles with scimitar and arrow, and always the picturesque costume and language of a picturesque period.On the stage the Fanchon and Marco revue features Steve Evans, Miller and Wilson, Ruth and Eddie, the Mark Leddy singers, Byrnes and Farney and the Gae Foster girls.

Cooper Jr. and Thomas E. Terrill. (Knopf, $50.) This academic survey of the history of the American South runs from 1607 to the present. Extensive use of maps, charts and illustrations helps move and shape the immense amount of material. Short, manageable sections linked with neat transitions keep the reader oriented. However, William J. Cooper Jr., a professor of history at Louisiana State University, and Thomas E. Terrill, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina, creep so cautiously through events that they render their history rather bland. The authors rarely enhance their bare-bones accounts with intimate or quirky details. The competent prose is slowed occasionally by a bumpy phrase or sentence, and, strangely enough, by a number of unattributed quotations from scholars. Overall, \\"The American South\\" is very strong on the intricacies of political parties and economic developments. After a peculiarly placating section on slavery, the authors move into a more balanced presentation of postbellum race relations, including a fine overview of Jim Crow. Native Americans again are shortchanged","excerpt":"there is no space given, for example, to the remarkable late 18th-century and early 19th-century evolution of the Cherokees.

The volume ends with as many predictions as reflections, and this may date it unnecessarily.

Jesse Davis is a burning, intense alto saxophonist who has completely absorbed the message of Charlie Parker. What Mr. Davis really flaunts is Parker's phrasing, liquid and relaxed at all tempos. Mr. Davis is one of the finest young musicians to arrive in jazz recently, and Bradley's is a good place to hear him stretch out. Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 10 P.M., midnight and 2 A.M. There is a $12 cover, plus an $8 minimum.  Jazz's Jester    Sun Ra, the Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, Manhattan, (212) 219-3055. Sun Ra, the court jester of jazz, has a seemingly endless supply of material with which to send an audience on an intergalactic trip. Tunes by Fletcher Henderson mix with free improvisation, rhythm-and-blues backbeats and just about anything else. Hearing Sun Ra's Arkestra, disheveled and loose, is one of jazz's great experiences. Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and midnight. Tickets are $9 in advance or $11 at the door. Coleman Plus 3    George Coleman, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7902. Half of George Coleman's regular working band is playing with the trumpeter Danny Moore at the Village Vanguard this week, so this show is an opportunity to hear one of jazz's more brutal and prolix players in the company of other musicians. Mr. Coleman will be joined by the young pianist Benny Green, the bassist David Williams and the drummer Lewis Nash. Mr. Coleman never has an off night, but a different group just might push him further in the direction in which he's already going, which is brilliance. Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 8 P.M., 10 P.M. and midnight","excerpt":"there is no third set on Sunday. The cover is $15, and the minimum is $7.50.

One of the world's great big bands settles into a weekend at the best-sounding club in New York. It'll be a sensual delight, an example of how jazz imagined a previously unimagined aural lushness. As a bonus, Illinois Jacquet is one of jazz's great entertainers, one of the last musicians who figured out that musical ability was never demeaned by entertaining an audience. Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.","excerpt":"there is no third set on Sunday. The cover is $15, and there is a $10 drink minimum. Saxophone Man     Gary Bartz, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. Mr. Bartz is an explosive alto saxophonist who is as adept at Charlie Parker as he is at John Coltrane. His lines, complex and dense, sum up modern jazz harmony, and he has a traditionalist's driving swing to make it all work. He's a little-known master, falling in jazz's commercially dead area between the older survivors and the younger new faces. Sets through Sunday are at 10 P.M., midnight and 2 A.M.; there is a $12 cover.

Pharoah Sanders is a gritty, tough tenor saxophonist who moves easily between be-bop and modal styles, throwing shouts and moans in either form, and he'll also sing a bit. Everything he does has a 1960's intensity. Shows are through Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. and midnight, with no third show on Sunday. There is a $15 cover, plus a $10 minimum. Wandering Tonalities     Cecil Taylor, Condon's, 117 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 254-0960. Whatever it is Mr. Taylor plays, it's without a genre to support it. A virtuoso pianist, he wanders somewhere between the tonalities of European concert music and the improvisational freedom suggested by jazz. He's performing with a quintet, and it's a chance to catch up with one of America's great virtuosos. Sets are tonight through Sunday at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.","excerpt":"there is no third set on Sunday. The cover is $15, and there is a two-drink minimum.

In Bill Frisell's improvising and compositions, there's a sense of the great expanse of American culture. He'll use country ideas, or rock-and-roll, or he'll swing phrases. He'll play Thelonious Monk or Charles Ives or Madonna. And the musicians he's working with for this date, Kermit Driscoll on bass and Joey Baron on drums, give him all the room he needs to let his guitar spread sound throughout the room, a great wash of Americana. Shows tonight and tomorrow night are at 9:30, 11:30 and 1","excerpt":"there is no third set on Sunday.

PETER WATROUS Hampton at the Blue Note    Lionel Hampton, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. Lionel Hampton has been an important figure for most of jazz history, and his group for this date, including Sweets Edison and Clark Terry on trumpets, Al Grey on trombone and James Moody on saxophone, is about as good a group as he's ever had. There's more wit, and more improvisation, on one bandstand than most cities hear in a year. The cover is $45, and the minimum is $5. Shows are tonight through Sunday at 9 and 11:30 P.M. P. W. Art in Review"},{"year":"1993","title":"A Pianist's Moods   Stephen Scott, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. Mr. Scott is the most brooding of all the young pianists, willing to let a solo sit and stew in its own funk. His playing, more than that of many of his contemporaries, is terse and pared down, instead of overwrought. He's also fascinated with dissonance and the shading of harmony. He'll be playing with his new trio, including Michael Bowie on bass and Clarence Penn on drums. Shows tonight and Saturday night are at 10 P.M., midnight and 2 A.M. There is a $12 cover and an $8 minimum. PETER WATROUS Keeper of the 88 Keys    Tommy Flanagan, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. The piano master returns, bringing with him his regular band of Peter Washington on bass and Lewis Nash on drums. They'll perform perfectly balanced pieces from the jazz repertory, drawing on Thelonious Monk, Thad Jones, Bud Powell, John Coltrane and others. The trio is one of jazz's great offerings, a chance to hear elegance in motion. This weekend's shows, through Sunday night, are at 9, 11 and 12:30","excerpt":"there is no third set on Sunday.

Donald Harrison, one of the most inventive young saxophonists working in jazz, is at his best when playing in intimate clubs like Bradley's. Using rhythm-and-blues ideas, be-bop and modern harmonies, Mr. Harrison brings together all sorts of worlds. He will be joined by a trio that includes the pianist Larry Willis. Shows tonight through Sunday are at 10 P.M., midnight and 2 A.M. The cover is $12 ($10 on Sunday), and there is an $8 minimum.  Double Improvisation    Art Farmer, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Manhattan, (212) 242-1785. Art Farmer has one of the sweetest tones around on fluegelhorn, and occasional echoes of Miles Davis can be heard in his playing. Mr. Farmer is spare, poised and graceful. His group features the saxophonist Clifford Jordan, who is playing better than ever, and together they offer two different perspectives on improvisation. Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 10 P.M., midnight and 1:30 A.M.","excerpt":"there is no third set on Sunday. There is a $15 cover charge, plus a $6 minimum.  Drumming Everywhere    Andrew Cyrille, Condon's, 117 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 254-0960. Andrew Cyrille is one of the master drummers who came of age in the 1960's, and his playing is unabashedly eclectic. He'll play driving, straight-ahead jazz, then use the walls, or his body, as percussion instruments. He always puts together better-than-average bands, and this one is no exception, featuring the trumpeter Hannibal Marvin Peterson, the saxophonist Oliver Lake and the pianist Reggie Workman. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.; there is no third set on Sunday. There is a $15 cover ($12.50 on Sunday), plus a two-drink minimum.

Dorothy Donegan is one of the true originals of jazz, a pianist who combines great virtuosity with a wildly comic sensibility and an exuberantly swinging drive that can lift an audience out of its seat even while she is weaving subtleties through her performances. She has been at it for a long time now -- since the mid-1940's in Chicago -- and she hasn't slowed down. With one of her favorite drummers, Ray Mosca, who knows the ins and outs of her musical thinking, and supplemented by Jon Burr on bass, she plays tonight and tomorrow at 10 P.M., midnight and 1:30 A.M.","excerpt":"there is no third show on Sunday.

Mr. Stripling is now in the pit band of the Broadway musical \\"Jelly's Last Jam.\\" He will lead his quintet at the last of the spring season of three afternoon tea dances (both tea and dancing are free) at the intimate Park Avenue Plaza.

The great alto saxophonist Jackie McLean is celebrating his 60th birthday at the Village Vanguard. Mr. McLean, a searing improviser, will be joined by his saxophone-playing son, Rene, for pieces that patch together modal, free and harmonic playing. Mr. McLean began his career in the late 1940's, when the search for a new jazz language was on, and he has never stopped looking. His shows are always filled with exploration, and his traditionally skeptical tone puts pretense on the run.

Johnny Pacheco, who made some of the best charanga and salsa records of the 1960's, is a fine flutist and composer who has a great ear for hiring the right singers.

This is no world of peaceful Zenlike tranquillity. This is a world of stuff -- compact disks, comic books, computers and James Dean posters. And it's mostly American-inspired stuff; examples of traditional Japanese art are almost nowhere in evidence. \\"Tokyo Style\\" is an important photographic record of a way of life, but it's almost 400 pages of clutter, and ultimately, for an American, it's like viewing life lived in an M.R.I. machine.

And to prove that this was not just a flash in the pan, he has followed it up with \\"Die Gräfin von Monte Christo\\" (The Countess of Monte Christo), which has just had its première at the Ufa Palast. Here again is an idea that runs well out of the conventional groove and yet has all the qualities that are considered necessary for popular screen success. There is plenty of dramatic action, plenty of mundane atmosphere","excerpt":"there is the poor little girl who suddenly becomes the talk of a city. Can the distributers and theatre owners who sit with their knees on the film industry's chest—can they ask for more?Herr Reisch mixes this old receipt so that it seems to take on an entirely new flavor. Jeanette, a screen extra, is playing a beautifuly gowned lady driving her car up to an elaborate hotel. But the girl is sick of her hand-to-mouth existence (on top of everything, she has just broken with her sweetheart, a journalist out of a job). She wants for once really to live and so, instead of stopping the car in the set, she drives right out of the studio, to the surprise and consternation of the whole staff. Next morning, after an all-night run, she appears at a luxurious hotel in a mountain resort. There she is accepted on her face value and registers as the Countess of Monte Christo, the name on the luggage put in her car by the studio property-man. Her trunks are empty, but she gets them filled because her room is burgled and the management believe the thief had stolen all her clothes. But the \\"baron,\\" the would-be thief, sees through her and proposes that she come with him to Venice and pull off the same stunt on a more elaborate scale. The girl refuses, as she had merely intended this to be a short adventure which was to end with the return of everything to the studio. But, in the meantime, she has picked up an acquaintanceship with Roumowsky, an elegant gentleman who has taken a great liking to her and to whom she also is very strongly attached. In an effectively dramatic scene he gets rid of the \\"baron,\\" at the same time disclosing that he is an eighteen-carat crook for whom the police of three continents are searching. The \\"baron's\\" revenge is a letter to the authorities which leads to Roumowsky's arrest. The girl gets away and gives herself up. Her reporter friend gets his job back by getting a scoop on the case and the girl is merely given a suspended sentence.Fine Direction.And how subtly and yet forcefully the young Karl Hartl has directed the picture. \\"With one leap he is up in the top rank of German film stagers. His dialogue is natural and yet can rise to vivid emotional climaxes. And he does not neglect the pictorial angle—something which often happens when speech is given its full value. The only objection I can make to his work is that there are some sequences that drag a bit for our American taste. But this is a German habit for which they have a name, \\"auspielen\\" (playing it out to its full length), and they are under the impression that it gives a more realistic effect.The acting of the cast was a surprise too. First, Brigitte Helm as the extra girl—I have always insisted that she should stick to rôles of the \\"metropolis\\" type for which she is physically best suited. But here she shows that she has developed into an exceptional actress who can handle rôles of depth and sympathetic simplicity with the best of them. And Rudolph Forster as Roumowsky for the first time let us feel warmth behind his Barrymore-like insouciance. And Gustav Gründgens, Lucie Englisch and Matthias Wiemann crawled completely into the characters they played. An acting festival!A Colorless Work.How important a scenario is was also shown by the director Erich Engel's latest comedy, \\"Fünf von der Jazzband\\" (Five of the Jazzband), first run at the Capitol last week. Hermann Kösterlitz, who adapted the script from a stage comedy of the same name, gave Engel very little to work with. He took a vague little plot and made it even more wabbly by spreading rather than concentrating it. It just saunters along and nobody much cares where or why. You don't get interested in the little errant girl who is engaged to play in a jazz-band act because she fell from a ladder into the bass drum, the manager thinking it was a part of the turn. And the four boys who make up the syncopated orchestra don't come to life as individuals. And most colorless of all is the rich young man who finally snaps the girl away from under their noses.And this is criminal, for Engel has a lot to give the screen. As Germany's finest stage director he could do much to raise the level of dialogue on the screen. In \\"Wer nimmt die Liebe ernst?\\" he showed that his stage methods were equally adaptable to the screen. And again in this picture there are scenes of such vocal perfection that it makes the work of most screen directors seem amateurish. But I feel that here he has gone too far in the direction of delicacy. He has let the subtlety, which the microphone allows, tempt him to get too intimate. Many of the scenes didn't get over to the audience—to be frank, they were underplayed.Nondescript Performances.And this time his handling of actors was not nearly so successful. Jenny Jugo, whom he had in his first picture, is equally as enlivening here. But the four youths of the jazz band and the so-called hero are such mediocrities that even a director of Engel's exceptional capacity can't persuade us that they are personalities.And another dastardly deed to be chalked up to the crimes of the scenario writers is the script of Hans Albers's latest starring vehicle, \\"Der Sieger\\" (The Victor). It is credited to one of Germany's best novelists, Leonhard Frank. I have a dim recollection of a lot of vacant pictures, but I can't recall one in which less happened than here. The first five minutes are built around an amusing little idea and then the story vanishes like mist suddenly blown away. And yet the film goes rolling on around Hans Albers's likable swaggers, around Käthe von Nagy's tingling Hungarian eyes, around Werner Heymann's tuneful music, with the tasteful sumptuousness which is typical of a Pommer-Ufa production. It goes on and on.

In the first place, it addresses itself to the essential issues of the Arab-Israeli dispute, without losing sight of the intricate forms that those issues have taken in practice. It is written out of deep personal conviction, but also from the point of view of an outsider, who maintains a certain inevitable (and valuable) distance, and makes illuminating use of his own concerns and experiences - those of an Irishman, in particular. It is the work of a liberal who disagrees with many of the prevailing liberal assumptions about the Middle East, and who engages unflinchingly with those points that most need to be argued in the current climate of opinion.

Miles of beautiful outdoor scenery in stunning Technicolor is lavishly punctuated with rough and tumble episodes, moments of tender romance and a smattering of folk customs, circa 1856, when adventurous pioneers were struggling against nature and hostile Indians to make their fortunes in the Oregon country.Almost every type of familiar character one might expect to encounter in a sagebrush melodrama is on hand. There is Dana Andrews, the sturdy hero who operates a flourishing general store and mule freight service when he isn't being shot at","excerpt":"there is Ward Bond, the hard-drinking outlaw; there is Brian Donlevy, the local banker who gets into trouble losing his depositor's gold dust at poker, and there is Susan Hayward and Patricia Roc to remind the boys—and the audience, too—that love is a wonderful thing. And, for extra measure, Hoagy Carmichael wanders through the film strumming a mandolin and groaning in his peculiar fashion a number of melancholy pseudo-hill billy tunes.Good acting by all concerned, a smooth-flowing script and generally well-paced direction are definite assets. Still there is not quite as much drive to the story as one could wish. For, while the action comes in spurts with all the fury of a smashing summer thunderstorm, it subsides just as quickly. Granting the superior production quality of \\"Canyon Passage,\\" the basic difference between this picture and the ordinary Western is the number of subplots which help to prolong its running time to ninety-odd minutes, whereas the average horse opera runs a straight course on the mathematical principle that such is the shortest distance between two points.It is customary for the hero in such films to mix it up for the sake of his honor with a bruiser almost twice his size, and the slaughter involving Dana Andrews and Ward Bond is really something to behold. When a fellow gets his head split open with a bottle in Technicolor, the sight is far from pleasant but undeniably effective. But that's only a small part of the mayhem, for scalps fly like so many toupees in a hurricane when the warring Indians swoop down from the hills and put the torch to the town of Jacksonville. Yet, amid all this elemental, physical melodrama, Ernest Pascal, the scenarist, finds time to contemplate some more normal aspects of frontier life. For instance, the festivities attendant upon the cabin-raising ceremony for a newly married couple are altogether charming.Weighing its good points against its bad ones, \\"Canyon Passage\\" still has a very comfortable margin in its favor. In short, there's a lot of good old-fashioned thrills awaiting those who drop into the Criterion these days.

He has his fling at a series of flashbacks in which the gallant Dr. Brent, after perusing the announcement of Dorothy's wedding, recalls the scenes of the past.Betty Blythe impersonates Dorothy's mother, a mundane creature who urges her daughter to marry Marsh. Mrs. Gordon shows Dorothy all the unpaid bills and, what comes as no surprise, Dorothy capitulates. There is a lot of fuss, but a storm sequence aboard Marsh's yacht settles matters in a more or less satisfactory way. Marsh appears to have a great deal more heart than was expected, for after being cured of amnesia by an operation, he sees to it that Dorothy and Dr. Brent are happy with their child.In one sequence aboard the yacht Marsh discovers that Dorothy has gone to he state room. The audience sees this. And Dorothy, who was supposed to be so much in love with the young surgeon, appears to be extremely vain when aboard the millionaire's craft. She is arrayed in all the diaphanous, fluffy materials that one young woman could wear. You may hazard that if she does not like Marsh, she might at least make an effort to look unattractive before him.

THE PIANO TUNER, by Daniel Mason. (Knopf, $24.) A first novel whose alert, responsive, generous hero is a London piano tuner, selected by the authorities in 1886 to trek into Burma's backest beyond to treat the piano of a (possibly mad) British surgeon and proconsul.

Unless we permit a complacent feeling of modern superiority completely to distort our vision, we must recognize Griffith's amazing technical skill and admit his right to the title \\"Dean of the American Cinema.\\"His story was chaotic and muddled. He attempted to weave four separate themes into a single continuity, designed to preach tolerance and the brotherhood of man.

In Individual scenes, however, such as the Feast of Belshazzar, the battle episodes, the strike sequences in the modern tale and many others—he displays breathtaking mastery of camera, an imaginative perception of the value of small detail in mass scene that has been unchallenged to this day.

At the same time, the figures - Aphrodites all, even when posing as washerwomen - are very like Maillol's, having similar proportions and the same heavy, tubular limbs.    The likeness isn't exactly a matter of influence, for while Renoir admired Maillol, and the sculptor, 20 years his junior, saw himself as the painter's spiritual son, each in his own medium had long been pursuing the classical ideal. Not that the ideal was entirely a figment of the ancient Greek imagination: Maillol contended that Mediterranean towns abounded in chunky young women with short torsos, small, wide-set breasts and sturdy legs.   Even so, the relationship between the sculpture of the two men is more than one of shared affinities","excerpt":"there was a third party without whom Renoir would probably not have achieved prominence as a sculptor at all.

Born in Keene, NH in 1921, she grew up in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and graduated from the Beaver Country Day School. In 1942 in the midst of WW II she married her husband of 54 years, Hamilton Hadden, Jr. They settled in Westbury (and later Brookville), NY. Sally was a devoted wife and mother, whose family danced mostly to her tune amidst numerous dogs and horses. She was a longstanding member of the Colony Club of New York.

In 1996, at the age of 75, she and her husband moved to Duncaster in Bloomfield, CT, where she found an inviting community in which to knit supportive and stimulating friendships. She was a former President of Planned Parenthood of Nassau County, NY, and an Endowment Trustee of the Greater Hartford Association for Retarded Citizens (HARC) in CT. She passionately embraced her causes and those of her family. She was predeceased by her husband, Hamilton, and grandson, Sam Hadden; and survived by her children and children-in-law, Kitty and Harry Lee, Susie and David Lawrence, Ham and Hilary Hadden, and David and Sara Hadden; as well as her grandchildren, and their spouses, all of whom delighted her: Johnny and Ashley Lee, Bob Lee, Claire Lee, John and Tara Lawrence, Katie Lawrence and Matt Sawatzky, Sarah Lawrence, Ham and Patricia Hadden, Alice Hadden, Lee Hadden, Jamie Hadden and Liza Hadden.

Elsa, too, is not a dramatic soprano part. Miss Marton has a big voice, but it's not a real trumpet, like Birgit Nilsson's. Instead, she makes her best impression in ecstatic, lyrical music.

And after all it is entertainment that most spectators seek. In \\"Rupert of Hentzau,\\" which is the chief attraction this week at the Strand, Bert Lytell, famed for his head of curly hair, acts the rôle of King Rudolf of Ruritania and Rudolf Rassendyll, the monarch's English prototype.This photoplay is equipped with large and impressive settings, that of the street scene in which so many thrilling incidents occur, being particularly charming. The photography also is of high standard and pleasingly original in certain sequences, notably the \\"shots\\" taken looking down upon the players.The principals are all well-known to the screen world, but this does not mean that they are suited to the characters allotted to them. There are plenty of players who would have been infinitely preferable in most of the important rôles. The male contingent seams to suffer from self-consciousness, brought about by the uniforms in which they appear. They are stiff and deliberate, mindful of the old-time tragedian. Lytell struts around in many of the scenes as if his boots were as weighty as those of a diver.He strikes a pose on entering a room and then forces an expression which is utterly unlike the average conception of a sovereign. As one gazes at this film one can't help thinking of the brilliant performance of Lewis Stone in \\"The Prisoner of Zenda.\\" Lytell obviously changed his usual facial lines to express the dissolute autocrat, and to accomplish this he emphasized the prominence of his chin and furrowed his forehead. It caused one to think of chins and pay no attention to the nether extremity of each player's countenance. There was Hobart Bosworth's fighting chin with another creeping up under it","excerpt":"there was Bryant Washburn's dimpled chin, Elmo Lincoln's fron chin, Claire Windsor's perfect chin and Lew Cody's modest chin.As the gallant Rassendyll. Lytell relaxed his countenance and was his gentler self. He was much better in this part, which he took in an easy way.Elaine Hammerstein is quite attractive in many of her pictures, but she does not strike one as giving a sympathetic performance as Queen Flavia. Hobart Bosworth is efficient as Colonel Sapt, except when he stalks to the fireplace and strikes a dramatic pose.Count Rupert of Hentzau, the exile, played by Cody, wears a Russian blouse effect uniform with a Sam Browne belt. Cody is quite good in this rôle, to which he imparts a certain characterization. In the sword duel, Lytell slashes at him, leaving himself unguarded, but nevertheless it is the scheming Rupert who is defeated.Adolphe Menjou, who plays the rôle of Count Rischenheim, another schemer, is usually good as a \\"heavy\\" in modern photodramas, but in this one his uniform seems a hindrance to him.At dinner, with the royal entourage, Colonel Sapt, eager to stop Rischenheim from reporting to the King about the Queen's stolen letter, digs a pistol into Rischenheim's ribs in such a way that one feels that it could hardly go unobserved by everybody. But the director, Victor Heerman, does not think so. Sapt follows Rischenheim into the corridor and the King appears to turn his head so as not to see what the director does not wish him to.The story, as will be remembered, deals with the stealing of the Queen's letter to Rassendyll and the plotting of Rupert to get back into favor by telling the monarch about it. Then there is the remarkable resemblance of the King and his English cousin. It is amusing to note that Baron von Brinken is credited with being the authority on court etiquette for the production.The sub-titles are sometimes ludicrous. One reads: \\"For God's sake, let us act. Let us go and see the King.\\" And another quotes the King as saying: \\"Gentlemen. I shall walk in the gar-den and it will not please me to be disturbed.\\"The mile or so of film is, however, entertaining in spite of the director, the actors and the title writers.How they happened to light upon Theodore Kosloff as the player for the leading rôle in \\"Children of Jazz,\\" the screen feature this week at the Rialto, will remain one of the unsolved mysteries of the picture world. He is a capable actor utterly miscast in this fantastic photoplay. On the other hand Eileen Percy never looked prettier than she does as Babs Weston, and she acts the part with plenty of spirit and dash, befitting a girl entranced by jazz music who welcomes every engagement ring that comes her way.Those who learn that there is an island where they can get away from the drum and the saxophone will be cheered by this production while they are in the theatre. There are some remarkable sea scenes on a coast where the great breakers crash on the principals in a most impressive way. It causes one to think that a really good marine production with \\"shots\\" of mighty seas would be a great asset in any theatre.The story is termed a melodramatic comedy, and in the opening one sees Babs's father, John Weston, returning with his daughter's fiancé, reaching home on Christmas night. To use the title-writer's words, Weston discovers the \\"tinseled god of jazz enshrined in his home.\\" It is, with a vengeance, and Babs seems to be getting engaged to men as fast as she can, little knowing that Richard Forestall, who is expected to marry her, is about to darken the door.The noise and revelry of that night, and others, causes Forestall to denounce Babs and break the engagement. He sai???s forth to the island where dwells his eccentric father, who clings to the dress and customs or 1850.Here the scenario writer and director are apparently in a quandry as to how to get Babs on the island. It is solved by having a hydroplane ride, the machine landing on the place, where women wear crinoline skirts and men top hats. After the sea scene Babs soon becomes part of the life of the island, and with the natural persistence of the screen, there is a fist fight, this time in which the hero is slugged time and again and defeated. Incidentally, he shows no marks after the encounter and is still breathing as if nothing unusual had happened. Eventually Kosloff wins Babs.The costumes on the island and the sets are picturesque. Two of the men to whom Babs is engaged are Clyde Dunbar (Robert Cain), anticipating a divorce, and Ted Carter (Ricardo Cortez), a worthy young man who gets left in the lurch. The novelty of this production makes it quite pleasing as an entertainment, and the only pity is that such a serious looking individual as Kosloff should have been cast in this story of the defeat of jazz life.Other Photoplays.At the Capitol, \\"Success,\\" with Brandon Tynan, Mary Astor and others. \\"Merry Go Round,\\" plays a second week at the Rivoli.THEATRICAL NOTES.\\"Tin Gods,\\" by William Anthony Maguire, will be produced in Asbury Park on Aug. 6 by Sam H.

Illustrated. Maps. 407 pp. New York: Atheneum. $25.   THE Germans must be becoming a bit tired of anniversaries. Last spring they had to make up their minds about how to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, and long before May 8 had been reached, the debate had caused a political controversy of major proportions. This year marks the 200th anniversary of the death of Frederick the Great of Prussia, and while that is not likely to cause a repetition of last year's hullabaloo, it is not without awkwardness.   Which Frederick should be celebrated, the philosophe de Sans Souci or the victor at Leuthen and Liegnitz? The question caused great nervousness among those planning the Prussian Exhibition held in Berlin in 1981","excerpt":"there was concern lest any emphasis on Frederick's military skills might offend the public.

And yet, in the same breath, I must confess that I didn't have to scrape around and tear my hair to find 10 outstanding productions in this calendar year. The fabulous invalid really does have some life in her yet.   The following list is in alphabetical order. The year's outstanding revivals are cited among the runners-up that follow the top 10.  ''Crimes of the Heart.'' In Beth Henley's Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy, the three MaGrath sisters of Hazlehurst, Miss., sit in a kitchen and contemplate, among other things, murder, suicide, their granddaddy's coma, a dead cat and lost love. Written with a Southern Gothic verve worthy of Flannery O'Connor, the play is an antic and finally moving account of one family's ability to barrel through the absurdities of existence - to come to peace with life's baffling, often unpremeditated crimes of the heart. The Broadway production, which originated last Christmas at the Manhattan Theater Club, has been gloriously directed by Melvin Bernhardt.

The new novel begins with a birth. In her diary Nicole des Jardins, a life scientist and the wife of Richard Wakefield, a computer scientist, describes the delivery of a daughter with the help of Gen. Michael O'Toole, a sensitive friend of the family. The first hundred pages describe the attempts of this plucky little band to survive inside an alien artifact whose self-regenerating systems offer both life-saving resources and deadly dangers. Feeling an obligation to provide a more varied gene pool for their descendants, the three adults play a conscience-stricken game of procreative musical chairs. Just when it appears that they have succeeded in making their house in space a home, Rama arrives at a space station so vast that the state of Rhode Island could fit into one of its decks.

In it is Charlie Chaplin, in off-stage clothes and physiognomy, directing a scene, apparently in a great hurry to go on a fishing trip to Catalina Island. Then there are other screen celebrities, actors and actresses, directors and camera men, scores of whom are shown seated at the democratic tables of the studio restaurant, proving that they eat their meals with the same enjoyment as people in other lines of business.The production is called \\"Souls for Sale\\" for one thing, because it was the title of the original story when it appeared in a magazine, and also because it smacks of wickedness. But there is nothing wicked in \\"Souls for Sale\\" except the villain, who has to be, and he saves a life before he dies.The production is filled with impossible and exaggerated situations, but it is entertaining. At the outset, Remember Seddon, a dainty little girl married only an hour or so before to Owen Scudder (Lew Cody), is seen on the observation Platform of a fast train bearing them to the coast, where they intend embarking for China. Remember suddenly distrusts her husband, and when the train halts she profits by his absence to climb down from the observation platform and finds herself in the desert. Throughout the night she trudges on until she finally is overcome. When she regains consciousness an Arab sheik is bending over her??? and to her utter dismay, as she rubs her eyes, she hears him talking in English. He relieves her doubts concerning the desert by telling her that he is a member of a motion picture company \\"on location.\\" She is carefully carried to the hospital tent of the company, and, after having been gently cared for by a woman, Remember asks who is the \\"sweet lady.\\"She is informed that the \\"sweet lady\\" is the best known wickedest woman on the screen. Remember is struck with the life of the moving picture people and has a burning desire to become an actress. Eventually she receives a \\"test,\\" and when she views the pictures of herself she realizes her shortcomings, her awkwardness and her forced expressions. She breaks down and weeps, and when the director sees the real tears he tells her that if she can weep like that on the set, she will make good as an actress. So, of course, Remember becomes a studio star.Then her husband returns, and Lew Cody makes a fine bad husband. He looks at her imitation pearls, admits that he is wanted for murder, but wants money to get away. He is seized with jealousy over the director, played by Richard Dix, and pushes the airplane propeller, used for fake wind storms, at the man who has fallen in love with Remember. The girl suddenly leaps to warn the director and Lew Cody, to save his wife, gets caught in the flying blades and is himself killed. The body is on the ground but the fortunate director, evidently always keen on his work, asks Remember to do the scene \\"just once more.\\"An impressive part of the production is the burning of a great circus tent, which is done with the realism that can always be obtained on the screen so long as the cost is forthcoming.There are some bright titles in the production and very good ideas, especially when the director has a foreboding that a real hurricane is \\"going to wreck the artificial storm.\\" It is also strange to have a director jealous of \\"the great lover of the movies.\\"Some famous movie actress will want \\"Hollywood\\" inscribed on her heart when she dies!Obviously there are only a few of life's obstacles which an enthusiastic, true-blue \\"go-getter\\" cannot clear. T. Roy Barnes, as \\"Bill\\" Peck, is energetically illustrating in the Rialto this week the boundless possibilities of a young man who is a born \\"go-getter.\\" Supposing that all store telephone booths are occupied and \\"Bill\\" is in a hurry, he instantly resolves upon a plan to empty at least one of the booths. He calls his faithful Boston bull, smears the dog's shout with whipped cream, shouts \\"Mad dog!\\" and in a second is nonchalantly calling up his number. But of course \\"Bill\\" is an experienced\\" go-getter.\\" He is the type who tells the girl he loves her ten minutes after the first meeting and almost in the same breath informs her where he is going to buy the engagement ring and the day he has selected for the wedding.\\"The Go-Getter,\\" is one of Peter B. Kyne's \\"Cappy Ricks\\" stories and there is precious little of the impossible that the picturized version of the story does not contain.\\"Bill\\" starts from the hospital for disabled soldiers with the idea of being a \\"go-getter,\\" and on applying for a position in a lumber yard he meets the general manager, played by Tom Lewis, and is given to understand that he is not wanted. He meets Mary Skinner, falls in love with her, anticipates her regarding the date of their marriage, runs into \\"Cappy Ricks,\\" (William Norris) who has more authority, and has confidence in the young man, especially if he can prove himself a dyed-in-the-wool \\"go-getter.\\" \\"Cappy\\" instructs \\"Bill\\" to go and get a blue vase and bring it within a certain time. He gives the young enthusiast wrong directions, but nevertheless, in spite of burglars, fights and a price of $3,000 on the vase, which he, \\"Bill\\" does not possess, the \\"go-getter\\" purloins the vase. He has to reach \\"Cappy\\" with it by a certain time.Thereupon he prevails upon an aviator—an old war buddy—to sped him to a certain point, where for some reason or other he imagines he may run into \\"Cappy's\\" train.\\"Bill's\\" silk hat, knocked about in the fights and scrambles, still serves him faithfully when he gets into the airplane. He has to wear a morning coat to be warm enough on the long journey. He looks down from the sky, picks out the train, whispers to the aviator to bear down upon the moving string of lights. Eventually, as was devoutly hoped, \\"Bill\\" Peck proves himself a great \\"go-getter\\" by appearing with the vase on the train, having halted the limited by brandishing his burning morning coat. And there was \\"Cappy\\"","excerpt":"there was the doubting Thomas, Skinner, and—there was the girl—all ready to be cuddled on the observation platform of the imitation Twentieth Century Limited in the last scene.There is plenty of action in this, but it's rather twaddle.

But you couldn't tell that, really, from the way he played the game or how hard he studied the hand he was dealt and how he bet, bluffed, pondered, folded, raised. He came formally dressed to the table, arriving on the hour and departing when he'd said he would; well organized and solemn on those Thursday nights, he pursed his lips in concentration and adjusted his eyeglasses often and joked and chattered sparingly and allowed himself only one beer.

Yet the sheer oddity of the whole affair left one in a kind of daze. There was the shouting match that broke out in the balconies immediately after the concert began","excerpt":"there was the perplexing presence of Ursula Oppens, the formidable new-music specialist, as accompanist; there was the fluctuating quality of the soprano's own voice, alternately beautiful and bland. Whatever it was, it wasn't dull.   This was Miss Battle's second recital in New York since her abrupt dismissal from the Metropolitan Opera last February. Her operatic engagements have dwindled markedly in the last few years, and it would seem that the notoriously temperamental soprano is concentrating her energies on solo recitals.  When she sang at Carnegie Hall shortly after the Met incident, her accompanist was James Levine; for this occasion, she collaborated with Miss Oppens, who could not be further from the Met's world.

People will say, ''The traffic is too-too bad in old Aurangabad,'' or ''The shopping is still cheaper in old Aurangabad.'' Back in 1976, when I served as a junior lecturer on the English faculty of the Maulana Azad College and its affiliated Ladies' Section, everything in Aurangabad was old. The city had decayed, but otherwise not much else had changed since the glorious moment in the late 17th century when Aurangzeb, the last of the great Mogul emperors, moved the capital from Delhi to this little outpost at the top of the Deccan Plateau. And in fact, the city that I knew, with its dusty lanes filled with the insane honking of scooters and motorbikes and three-wheeled auto-rickshaws and its sleepy sweet shops and its ancient wooden houses, hasn't changed a bit.     But a new Aurangabad has wrapped itself around the old. The new Aurangabad has modern factories and broad, brilliantly lighted commercial streets and houses as big as hotels and health clubs and cybercafes and Chinese restaurants and even, in what is widely considered the single deepest incursion of cosmopolitan culture, a Domino's Pizza. I used to take great pride in Aurangabad's authentic ordinariness -- no god-men or yogic celebrities, no elephants, princes, movie stars or hippies. Aurangabad was the real India. And it still is, but the real India is a very different, and very much more differentiated, place than it used to be. In 1976, when I arrived, India was understood to consist of an enormous number of terribly poor people, a tiny sliver of the jet-setting rich and a middle stratum consisting largely of civil servants. This stratum is now known retrospectively as ''the old middle class.'' The public servants, or babus, were a governing class, not a consuming class","excerpt":"there was, in any case, scarcely anything to consume, since import and license restrictions ensured that all but the jet-setters had to content themselves with an extremely limited range of generally rather shoddy domestic merchandise.

The show looked like a workout by a cocksure rocker, bolstered by riffs and a beat that the Rolling Stones wouldn't disown. Mr. Mellencamp has built a populist image as the consummate regular guy, the small-town rocker who takes his knocks and comes up grinning. But behind his band's swaggering guitar lines, there's a paradox; since the mid-1980's, more and more of his songs have been about dead ends and his despair over everything from the state of the small farmer to war in the Middle East.

Other affectations include the band's heavily punctuated name; it's so proud of its exclamation points that they appear on the cover of its album, ''Give Me a Wall'' (Mute), and on the matching T-shirts worn by the four members onstage.      Most of all ¡Forward, Russia! has chosen a musical style synonymous with arty ambition. ''If you want to be something new, I'm coming,'' Mr. Woodhead sang in ''Thirteen,'' but the band has latched on to something old: the postpunk that appeared as the 1970s ended and was revived in the early 2000s by bands like the Rapture, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand. It's rock built on jabbing guitar lines, scrabbling chords, bruising rhythm-section riffs, jarring dissonances and irregular meters: music that bristles every way it can. And while the postpunk revival hit a peak in 2003-4, ¡Forward, Russia! might just prolong it through sheer nerve.

''Everybody let it sit there,'' Rustum Roy, who heads the Materials Research Laboratory of Pennsylvania State University, told the author. ''Ninety-nine point five percent of the nuclear budget went into making reactors, and what was left over went into this squeal of the pig, this reactor garbage, and so nothing developed in the more than twenty years that we neglected the cleanup cycle.''

Certainly, Roth's fictitious novelist, Nathan Zuckerman, faces neither censorship nor imprisonment in his rapid journey up the freeway of American literary notoriety. What Zuckerman does face is an ambitious and egocentric self, strong on nerve and stomach, weak in empathy - an impoverished self that is at once his only resource and his major stumbling block. In ''The Ghost Writer,'' Zuckerman is a young beginner who tastes critical approval without the popularity that is the dream of artists no less than of politicians and other performers. A few years later, in ''Zuckerman Unbound,'' Zuckerman attains fame with the publication of ''Carnovsky,'' a novel not unlike Roth's own ''Portnoy's Complaint.''

The total effect, however, is in Mr. Franchina's favor, because he makes his oblique observations on his tragic hero's life in knowledgeable, swift, forceful fashion denoting both technical professionalism and the ability to hold a viewer's interest despite some of the story's obscurities.Mr. Franchina is mostly concerned with a disenchanted, nearly defeated sculptor en route from Rome to Paris in a car containing his statue of the she-wolf of Rome suckling the infant founders of the Eternal City and a shipment of dope in a secret compartment.Almost the entire film is devoted to the trip—a visually exciting one—which exposes most of the sculptor's terrible hang-ups, as well as adventures en route that could only be described as highly unusual.A lissome brunette Parisienne, whom he picks up unceremoniously from the lecherous rich middle-aged Italian she's traveling with, seems to be as disengaged as he is.

One is Walt Disney's historic and immortal \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\\" The other is Sir Laurence Olivier's equally historic and immortal \\"Henry V.\\" Persons in search of diversion who have seen all the new ones (as have we) could do worse than visit—or revisit—both of these classic films.It is hard to believe the Disney picture is all of twenty years old, so sparklingly fresh and full of gusto does it appear on the Normandie's screen. We happened to walk in on it just at the start of the scene in which Snow White and the dwarfs do a hoe-down to the spirited Silly Song, with Grumpy banging the steam-organ and Dopey teetering wildly on the shoulders of a pal, cutting fantastic dance figures with the ecstatic heroine. And the house, full of kids, was giggling and squealing with unrestrained glee. It was a state of joyous contagion that a spoil-sport might wish to quarantine.This is one film that Mr. Disney has proudly (and shrewdly) proclaimed he will never release to television—and here's hoping he sticks to his word. It is simply beyond expectation that they could possibly get on the home screens the qualities radiated by it in theatres.Size and ColorIt is not only the full size and the color you get in seeing it as it was meant to be shown—and we are happy to note that Mr. Disney has not allowed it to be \\"scoped.\\" You see it now precisely as it was shown twenty years ago, and as it has been shown in subsequent revivals, without the top and bottom cropped to stretch the sides. And the color is just as strong and vivid as it was originally.But, more than that, you get from seeing it in a theatre the full thrill of the electricity that is inevitably generated by the lively friction of it upon a gang of kids—and it is seldom you go to a revival of \\"Snow White\\" without encountering kids. They're usually there with mothers—or grandmothers—aggressively excited and alert, watching that screen with the acquisitiveness of a magnet approaching steel. From all over the house you hear them laughing, sniffling, commenting openly, offering observations beyond an adult's perceptiveness. And, at the end, there is usually at least one bold young lady, her pigtails out like spears, who proclaims in fearless defiance, \\"I dun'wanna go home! I wanna see Snow White again!\\"This is immensely gratifying to one who believes in the theatre and the screen as indispensable means of offering culture of a healthy, nourishing sort in a community. It is a striking demonstration of the continuing vitality of films that have been made with sincere imagination, that have proved themselves as stimulants to the heart and mind and have the great power of giving people a shareable experience in a group.\\"Snow White\\" is one of those several pictures that, like \\"The Gold Rush\\" and \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" are special to our motion picture culture and should be enjoined by Federal legislation from being shown anywhere but in theatres.Headless HankThe same might be said for Sir Laurence's very special and very English \\"Henry V.\\" It is perhaps the all-time supreme achievement of getting Shakespeare upon the screen. More than his subsequent \\"Hamlet\\" and even his \\"Richard III\\" (which was much better than its profits indicated), it has the imagery as well as the words. It catches in pictorial grandeur the sweep of Shakespeare's vast chronicle of Henry's and England's conquest of France at Agincourt.But just as there might be legislation to compel its being shown in theatres, there might also be legislation to forbid its being stretched and Super-Scoped, as it has been in the projection now being offered at the Odeon. By reprinting it for exhibition on the new elongated screens its distributors have not only drained a lot of its color but they have cut off the tops of a lot of heads. Frequently leading characters, including Henry, appear with their necks or their chins as the last points of their anatomies visible at the top of the frame.This sort of reckless decapitation might not be amiss in \\"Richard III\\" but it is sheer sabotage in this picture.

Zimmerman, the top career Interior Department official in charge of onshore minerals, was talking about the ambitious plans of Secretary of the Interior James Watt plans to accelerate the leasing of oil-and-gas rights on Federal lands. What Zimmerman, whose title is Assistant to the Deputy Director for Energy and Mineral Resources, did not say, but what has been implicit in everything that he and Secretary Watt have been advocating for months, is that this fever should be exploited to spur domestic oil-and-gas production by opening up an additional 100,000,000 acres of Federal lands, mostly in Alaska and the Rocky Mountain states, for leasing. Their insistence on retaining the present methods of allocating onshore leases - a lottery for previously leased lands and a first-come, first-served (called, ''over-the-counter'') system for lands never before leased - has escalated an already heated controversy.

There are no classes or exams","excerpt":"there's no campus, even. There is only a very long walk: 1,500 miles.    EDUCATIONAL VALUE -- In the words of Taylor Morris, the professor who created the walk in 1969, a semester on the open road gives ''the gift of time.'' Prof. Doug Challenger, who walked the first leg this summer, agrees: ''Hardly at any point in your life are you going to have this much time to just reflect on your life.''    LANGUAGE ARTS -- Once a week, each student must join the ''van team.'' Carrying the group's luggage, the team drives ahead every day to scout for food and a place to pitch their 900-square-foot tent -- usually by asking at a random farmhouse, ''Will you let me and 20 of my friends sleep in your yard tonight?'' The students take language-for-travelers classes at the Franklin Pierce campus in New Hampshire before they leave. (They also carry a letter explaining their situation in the local language.)    REWARDS -- ''Dude,'' says Luke Wroblewski via a wobbly cellphone connection, ''I'm sitting on a beach in Sardinia.'' Mr. Wroblewski, a former Franklin Pierce student who is one of this year's walk leaders, has gone four times. When reached in September, he and his charges had been on the road for six weeks, having walked from Salzburg, Austria, through Bavaria, traversing the Alps and heading south to Livorno, Italy, before ferrying to Corsica and Sardinia. This particular trek was to end near Rome. (Costs are about the same as being on campus, plus air fare.) Much has changed since Mr. Wroblewski was a sophomore on the walk in 1997, he says, particularly since the war in Iraq. ''We knock on doors,'' he says. ''Sometimes they're slammed in our faces.'' But if the world has changed, the type of student who makes the walk is the same. ''I can pick a walker out of a crowd,'' he says. ''They have a zest for life. They're happy to be here.''    WM.

An administrator merely preserves his institution, embodies its traditions.

These add up to what FM radio's ''album rock'' programmers call anthems, songs that use rock instrumentation to beef up ballads. On stations that play primarily the recent oldies known as ''classic rock'' - big hits from the 1970's - ''Third Stage'' fits right in. The album has received saturation exposure since its release.   Technically, ''Third Stage'' is also a 1970's-style album. It is arranged for guitars, drums, pianos and organs -no synthesizers - and recorded on analog (not digital) equipment.

The robbery is accomplished through a confusing network of tunnels, natural and man-made, which make it comparatively simple for the robbers to drill up through the floor of the bank's vault and provide them with an escape route as well. The reader observes the break-in, then watches the local F.B.I. office attempt to justify its involvement in solving the crime, which was committed against a bank without Federal insurance. When justification does come, the longtime senior resident agent is unaccountably transferred by direct order of his old friend and supporter, J.

The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute notes with sorrow the profound loss of Earl G. Witenberg, M.D., who served as Director from 1963-1992. Dr. Witenberg's service for so many years, while extraordinary, was just one small measure of his singular, indefatigable, and all encompassing dedication to the White Institute. A larger than life personality, Earl's characteristic New England sparseness, straightforwardness, stubbornness and skepticism both intrigued and tantalized his colleagues and his students. Few people who came in contact with Earl left his compelling presence without a spirited story to tell about him. Earl's scholarship was profound and his curiosity boundless. During his early tenure at the White Institute, his research vision encompassed a wide range of areas. He initiated a Visiting Distinguished Lecturer Series and he spearheaded innovative conferences to which he invited scholars from related fields, and of many schools of thought, to enrich the Institute's intellectual foundation. Earl insisted on challenging conventional thinking and in eschewing dogmatism","excerpt":"thereby both contributing to the education and training of creative thinkers who could embrace ambiguity, and shaping the essential and lasting identity of the White Institute. Earl's pragmatism was no where more evident than in his leadership of the Institute. He brought it from financial uncertainty to economic solvency, and purchased a landmark building. He felt that an institute could not sustain itself unless it was constantly responsive to change. He was a decisive leader: tough, persuasive, courageous, canny and occasionally irascible. Dr. Witenberg had a superb reputation as a psychoanalyst. He was concerned with the real and actual nature of the analyst's involvement with the patient, and his deep respect for the ''other'' along with his penetrating views into character made him a widely sought after and much respected analyst and supervisor. Honest to a fault, and curiously but touchingly vulnerable, Earl had little tolerance for inauthenticity. A gallant soul, Earl remained committed to the Interpersonal tradition, and he stood for the best that he, the Institute, and its graduates could offer. His legacy is enduring and more concretely forged by the Earl G. Witenberg Chair. The Chair is among the many honors awarded to him in 1992, and one which will go forward to promote the work in which he always felt privileged to engage. Our deep condolences to his wonderful family whom he loved without limit. Charles C. Harrington, Ph.D. President, Board of Trustees Joerg Bose, M.D. Director, The White Institute     WITENBERG-Earl G., M.D. The Trustees, Officers and members of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis would like to express our sorrow for the loss of Dr. Earl Witenberg, past President and Charter Fellow of the Academy.

McNamara, one of the seminal thinkers of the nuclear era, sharply disputes the theory that a limited version of President Reagan's strategic defense plan, designed only to protect U.S. missile forces, would strengthen deterrence and improve nuclear stability.   Instead, the former Secretary of Defense believes, the U.S. should push for nuclear retaliatory forces scaled down by both superpowers to ''the lowest force level consistent with stability'' -only the number of weapons, probably fewer than 500 apiece, needed to deter the other from attack.   This long-term approach, Mr. McNamara thinks, should be coupled now with a declared policy of ''no first use'' of nuclear weapons - an approach, he argues, less threatening to the West than the present NATO policy of responding with nuclear weapons to an overwhelming Soviet conventional attack.   The idea of adding a limited defensive system to offensive nuclear forces - ''Star Wars Two,'' as Mr. McNamara described it to a New York audience assembled by the Committee for National Security - is based on the theory that even an imperfect defense would heighten the Russians' uncertainty of success for a ''first strike'' they might launch against the U.S. Thus, some strategists assert, the uncertainty would make such an attack less likely","excerpt":"therefore deterrence would be improved.

Then there is a cub reporter, known as Jay Walker, who is assigned to cover the story regarding a bandit who is making the locality quite uneasy. Mr. Walker is zealous, but one day he gets too close to the desperado, and finds himself one of the victims of the notorious Ducket Nelson. This gives the rival newspaper an opportunity to ridicule The Magnolia News, which does not increase Mr. Walker's prestige in his office. However, he is an indomitable young man, so once again he sallies forth to search for Nelson.The latter chapters of this production are less wild than the preceding ones. Mr. Walker is beheld in a boastful mood. He even goes so far as to declare himself to be the famous bandit, little thinking that at the moment he is talking to the real Ducket Nelson. There are one or two episodes where Mr. Walker borrows some of his ideas from \\"Alias Jimmy Valentine,\\" and his tales of opening safes interest a girl so much that she in turn glibly tells her companions how she held up the Casino in Monte Carlo and became known as Monte Carlo Kate.One of the captions reads:\\"Evening came because afternoon had gone and morning was not due until dawn.\\"John Patrick knows how to act before the camera, but there are scenes in this story which call for something akin to restraint.

It is based in part on allegations by former General Electric employees whose experience and knowledge was limited to their work assignments at West Milton.   U.S. Navy reactors are significantly different from the large civilian power reactors. The Navy prototype reactor plants used ashore for training and testing, such as at West Milton, are very similar to their sea-going counterparts. Operational matters at the prototypes may reflect on the security of the ships at sea","excerpt":"therefore, classification of information is a fact of life.   Navy reactors differ from the civilian ones in two principal areas, design and personnel. The design encompasses significant features that enhance reliability and system integrity under battle and shock conditions, and give the ships long endurance when repair support is nonexistent. The personnel are carefully screened and selected based on aptitude and high motivation. They are rigorously trained both in their duties and in the fundamentals of the systems they are to control. Their training continues while assigned to the prototypes under the close supervision of qualified crew members.   These reactor prototypes are not nuclear weapons facilities by any means of comparison. Therefore, the charge that \\"secrecy breeds corner-cutting\\" has no application. Detailed, objective and effective oversight was a hallmark of Adm. Hyman Rickover's control of the naval nuclear reactor program. The effectiveness of this program has increased over the years and is carried forward to this day.   These oversight reviews are made at many levels by technically competent individuals who are not responsible for the day-to-day operation of the plant. Mistakes or off-normal events are scrutinized objectively to determine the root cause and the appropriate corrective actions. This program is so effectively done by the Naval Reactors Branch that both the commercial nuclear power industry and the Department of Energy have recently applied the process to their activities.

SUPERMARKET MYSTERIES"},{"year":"2005","title":"''Carl,'' a 30-second commercial from United States Senator Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for governor of New Jersey, began running on Monday on cable and network television stations in Philadelphia and New York.    PRODUCERS -- S.D.D. Media and Message & Media    ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with a close-up of a young man identified as ''Carl Riccio, Warren, N.J.'' He talks about being injured three years ago in a high school wrestling match that left him quadriplegic as the ad opens to a wider shot of him in a wheelchair. The ad then cuts between images of Mr. Riccio, talking about the differences between Mr. Corzine and his Republican opponent, Douglas R. Forrester, on embryonic stem cell research, and still photos of Mr. Riccio in a wheelchair on the beach, surrounded by relatives and friends.    THE SCRIPT -- ''Almost three years ago now, I was in a wrestling match for my high school. I went to do a move and I was paralyzed from the neck down. Quadriplegic. Right now the most hopeful thing for spinal cord injuries is embryonic stem cell research. Doug Forrester doesn't support embryonic stem cell research","excerpt":"therefore, I don't think he supports people like me, and doctors who say a cure is coming. Jon Corzine supports embryonic stem cell research. I think he's the best candidate for our governor.''    ACCURACY -- Mr. Riccio, 19, a student at Villanova University, is right in suggesting that most scientists agree that embryonic stem cell research is more promising than adult stem cell research for finding cures for injuries and diseases. He is right in noting clear differences between Mr. Forrester and Mr. Corzine. While Mr. Forrester said during the primary that he opposed embryonic stem cell research -- thereby aligning himself with anti-abortion groups and President Bush -- he has suggested recently that his main objection was to public financing of such research. But tellingly, Mr. Forrester never uses the loaded term ''embryonic'' in public statements, saying only that he supports ''stem cell research'' in general. Indeed, he often seems uncomfortable discussing the issue, and has been criticized by abortion rights advocates and anti-abortion groups for waffling.    SCORECARD -- The ad promises to be potent, because it lures viewers into thinking that it is a positive, uplifting message, but instead turns into a biting and personal critique of Mr. Forrester, over an issue on which Democrats believe he is vulnerable. Mr. Riccio's comment that ''I don't think he supports people like me'' is one of the most memorable from Mr. Corzine's ads, and the way he says it -- by using the limited mobility of his arms to point to his chest, emotionally -- stings. The commercial also reinforces a common Democratic theme: that Republicans like Mr. Bush and Mr. Forrester often don't relate to the travails of people like Mr. Riccio.   DAVID W.

One was a reapportionment proposal backed by most Republicans, who wanted to replace the 1982 Democratic redrawing of boundaries for legislative and Congressional districts. The court ruled that the state's constitution allowed only one reapportionment every 10 years, and the Democrats' bill had used up the quota for the 1980's.

What it actually protects is the sex entrepreneur, in effect granting him license to pipe pornography into New York living rooms as long as there is a lockout box law on the books.  Unfortunately, your March 5 news article on the subject did not examine the many reasons why lockout boxes are, at best, false security.  First, it came out during legislative hearings in Utah two years ago that one key opened all lockout boxes. With Manhattan Cable claiming technical unfeasibility, one wonders how far we may have progressed since then in the creation and production of sophisticated locking devices.  Second, no locking device is a match for curious children and teen- agers, some of whom have already demonstrated their high-tech abilities by tapping into the Defense Department with home computers.  Third, the lockout boxes are too expensive and must be purchased in multiples for complete protection. One device at Group W locks out only two channels","excerpt":"therefore, subscribers must purchase two boxes in order to lock out three.  Fourth, no lockout box will prevent the ''bleeding'' of so-called scrambled cableporn signals onto sets where they are not wanted.  Fifth, parents obviously do not see locking devices as an answer. Group W has had only 25 requests, and Manhattan Cable only 2, out of 266,000 subscribers.  The New York State lockout box law does not solve the problem of gutter programming reaching our children.

They are the indivisible ingredients of success in the cultural-commercial mythology of this contemporary society, and they turn into each other in a certain vicious circle, sometimes to the brink of absurdity.  Fame and Fortune are not twin sisters in the Soviet literary world. One reaches a certain level of Soviet fortune by being promoted ideologically. In other words, one becomes a bearer of infamy rather than fame. Genuine literary fame in the Soviet Union often brings nothing but trouble","excerpt":"therefore, success in Soviet literature always creates a feeling of complicity - either against the bureaucratic ruling class or for it. If one can compare success with applause, I would say that success Soviet-style is a sort of one- handed clapping.   It would not be out of place at this point to mention the names of some fine Russian authors in order to demonstrate the hazards of literary fame in the Soviet Union.   Andrei Platonov, admired by connoisseurs as a Russian prose genius, found himself almost totally out of place in the early 1930's in the blooming orchard of Socialist Realism. I say ''almost totally out of place'' because Platonov worked as a janitor for several years in the backyard of the Writers Union compound. This enabled him to survive. SUCCESS AND THE SOVIET WRITER"},{"year":"1984","title":"To the Editor:      I agree with Donald Keen (letter May 15) that million-dollar business executive salaries are essentially an internal corporate matter and should certainly not be singled out for opprobrium in a society that heaps wealth and adulation on assorted athletes and entertainers - except, that is, when those salaries consist largely of taxpayers' money, involuntarily handed over to the corporations with the intent or connivance of the U.S. Government in the form of protectionist subsidies.   Corporate abuse of protectionist windfalls is, of course, the real reason for the recent furor over executive compensation, and it's an issue we shouldn't be distracted from by arguments over the general ethical propriety of paying top management big salaries.   Mr. Keen's letter ignores this issue, just as Phillip Caldwell, head of Ford Motor, ignored it on TV recently when he seemed to assert that his $7.3 million compensation simply reflected Ford stockholder determination to hold on to quality personnel and owed nothing to Government-imposed quotas on imported Japanese cars. Such quotas are an indirect tax on the consumer","excerpt":"therefore, the consumer has every right to expect the benefits conferred by such taxation to be allocated in an appropriate manner.  In short, Mr. Keen's comment that ''members of the million-dollar club have to answer only to their stockholders and their workers; they need not apologize to the media, to analysts, to Government officials or to other hand-wringers'' is a good rule of thumb for the ordinary business functioning in an open-market economy.

Nothing could be further from the truth.   Both New York State and New York City Departments of Health have for several years actively encouraged physicians to conduct counseling and voluntary testing of patients. Because disclosure of HIV infection and HIV-related information has resulted in numerous instances of discrimination in housing, employment and access to health care -- including not a few examples in Westchester County -- HIV infection is not a routine medical condition","excerpt":"therefore, written consent, counseling and confidentiality protections are required.    This model was developed by the medical and public-health community in 1985 when HIV antibody testing became available in this country. It is a ubiquitous model, supported by the Centers for Disease Control and utilized by all state health departments, not only by New York State.   In New York State, office-based HIV testing and partner notification can be carried out by private physicians or patients may be referred to free public services. Yet it is unclear just how classification of HIV infection as a communicable or sexually transmitted disease under Public Health Law would improve access to care for those infected, as Dr. Kaplan claims.   In fact, according to a substantial body of behavioral research, the consequences of such a designation -- mandatory contact tracing and name reporting -- would deter substantial numbers of persons at high risk from coming forward for HIV counseling and testing. This self-deferral from HIV testing and treatment is presumably exactly what Dr. Kaplan would wish most to avoid.

It has been renamed \\"Deception,\\" as Mr. Lubitsch's \\"DuBarry\\" was renamed \\"Passion\\" for American consumption, it being the opinion of the distributers, apparently, that such titles as \\"Passion\\" and \\"Deception\\" are more suited to the American, spectator, who, Mr. Griffith is reported to have said, has \\"the mind of a child nine years old,\\" than are \\"DuBarry\\" and \\"Anne Boleyn.\\"But though names may be changed, moving pictures may not, and therefore \\"Anne Boleyn,\\" or \\"Deception,\\" in its substance, remains as Mr. Lubitsch made it. And he did not make it for anyone with the mind of a child nine years old. That is the most important distinction of the picture, as it was of \\"DuBarry\\"","excerpt":"therein lies its fundamental difference from most of the American productions. \\"While there is excellent photography in both \\"DuBarry\\" and \\"Anne Boleyn,\\" there is better photography in many of the films made in America, and though the settings of the former are impressive and the scenes skillfully composed, they sometimes seem less genuine than the settings in many American pictures.The dramatic material of most of the American pictures, however, is puerile, and their treatment is mechanical, compared, to the material and treatment of a photoplay like \\"Deception\\"—it has to be called that sooner or later, so let it go. Here is a real story told so that intelligent people can enjoy it. Here is sturdy evidence that the screen is for adults as well as children, although a number of parents had their babies at the Rivoli yesterday to see the bestiality of Henry VIII and his court. Here is a work that holds the alert interest almost continuously, despite the fact that it is historical. Many people shy at the historical in entertainment, fearing either that they will be bored again or may be accidentally educated, but they needn't avoid \\"Deception,\\" unless they object to a real story of real people, with an impressive tragic ending. Those who don't will probably be entertained as they have seldom been entertained in a motion picture theatre.Exactly how accurate the history of \\"Deception\\" is one who has not made a specialty of England in the time of the Tudors cannot say, but it seems authentic, on the whole, except, perhaps, in the idealization of the character of Anne Boleyn, who is represented as quite a saint. Surely the Henry VIII, of Emil Jannings, as was his Louis XV., is one of the finest pieces of character work ever done on the screen. The licentious old king lives before your eyes. Who says they can't portray character in moving pictures merely because they use mechanical dolls instead of actors as a rule? Go to see His Most Christian Majesty. Henry VIII., and some of the others of his court, at the Rivoli this week.The Anne Boleyn of Henny Porten is also convincing most of the time, though it is to be regretted that Miss Porten seems so heavy sometimes, and is not as personable as she seemed in Henry's eyes. There's no doubt that in some scenes she does finished acting, becoming truly impressive at times, especially in the scenes preceding her execution, but when she tries to be young and gay she misses her mark. As photographed, at least, she is too old and too ponderous, possibly too Teptonic, for \\"sweet Anne,\\" if not for the tragic Queen.The others in the cast, discreetly unnamed, are well enough suited to their parts, and persuasive in their acting, though in some of them that methodical ponderosity commonly attributed to the Germans is too evident.There is nothing to suggest the quality of heaviness about Mr. Lubitsch, however. He has a Continental touch. Did he ever work in Paris or Vienna? Anyhow, his continuity and his separate scenes are handled with deftness. There is eloquence in almost every picture and in succession the scenes compose a climactic story that marches straight to its ending and stops when the end comes, which it does with Anne Boleyn going to the executioner's block in one of the most effective scenes ever put upon the screen. Mr. Lubitsch is a cinematician, too. He has to be to make such expressive moving pictures. Thank heaven, they have not been overloaded with subtitles, and they do not need as many as they have. Rich, colorful, dramatic, \\"Deception\\" is a photoplay for those who want genuine realism and can do without simpering heroines, pretty heroes, mechanical plots, and sentimental happy endings.King Vidor's latest work. \\"The Sky Pilot\\" is at the Strand this week, and, despite some obtrusive faults, and an overdone ending, it is a corking melodrama. Pictorially it is exceptional. Mr.Vidor's chief talent seems to be for making magically lighted, atmospheric moving pictures which convey meanings to spectators, though he seems to takespecial pride himself in his moral earnestness. Some will probably find much of the latter in \\"The Sky Pilot,\\" but others will have to ignore it in order to enjoy the melodrama. It may be added, too, that if Dr. Crafts is successful in barring from the screen all picturesthat \\"offend the religious belief of any person,\\" \\"The Sky Pilot\\" may run into difficulties, for surely there are professed Christians who believe in a spiritual and rationalized, rather than a physical and superstitious church militant. How faithful a translation of Ralph Connor's novel the picture is, the writer cannot say.The best acting is done by David Butler, as a ranch foreman. John Bowers, as the missionary, is satisfactory most of the time, and Colleen Moore does well enough except when her Broadway make-up and cabaret smile are too conspicuous.Ivan Abramson's \\"Mother Eternal,\\" with Vivian Martin at the head of thecast, opened at the Casino last night; the Rialto is celebrating its fifth anniversary with \\"Sacred and ProfaneLove,\\" directed by William D.

Paragon charges a $25 deposit for the converter box it now requires subscribers to use. By further scrambling signals, the cable-readiness aspect of television sets sold as cable ready has been rendered useless. This money must be returned if the subscriber cancels service. Presumably, Paragon is salting away the $25 in an interest-bearing account and collecting the interest.   Until last fall, Paragon included as part of its service a monthly guide to programs appearing on cable television. At the time this service ceased, a person representing himself as being from Paragon called to offer my family a subscription to TV Guide at \\"a special price\\" to replace a service that was provided at no extra cost. The saving was not passed along to subscribers.   Worse than Mr. Sarver's problems with Paragon's remote control, for which we now must pay $2 a month (subscribers can no longer use their television set's own remote control to change channels), are the problems I've encountered. While Paragon's remote turns on the converter box and changes channels, it does not turn on the television set or change the channel on the set to 3 as required to activate cable television.    If you want to keep your television and converter box out of the reach of very young children, as I must, you need Paragon's remote and your old remote. Just as absurd, Paragon's remote turns off the sound and changes the channel on your set when you're finished watching, and it can only be turned back up and to channel 3 again with your old reliable remote.   Mr. Sarver is right","excerpt":"these are excesses of a kind that only monopolies can make possible. If there were a competing cable company to subscribe to, I would be one of its first customers.

The doctor is not a romantic type but is, on the contrary, a hardy creature, without make-up or even a finger wave—a sort of industrialized Millet peasant girl. She goes through with the romantic scene, however, like a good patriot, the People's Commissar apparently having decided that the proletariat can now be trusted with a little spare-time lovemaking.The real hero of the picture, aside from that matinee idol, dialectical materialism, seems to be Maliboga, an adolescent stowaway who is to Marxist propaganda, it appears, what Horatio Alger's bootblack used to be in capitalistic philosophy. Tried and true, Maliboga comically works his way from the rags of the scullery somewhere on the seventy-second parallel to the riches of becoming a full-fledged meteorologist. What fun for any lad!Under reproachful photographs of Lenin and Stalin, the custodian of the airsled commits the enormity of damaging a cylinder and sees his colleagues, as a form of punishment, prepare to set out without him. On the point of their departure, however, two Eskimos enter, their Mongoloid faces registering little or none of the presumptive turmoil of their feelings, begging aid for a sick man, four days away by dog-sledge. Imagine every one's horror to learn that the afflicted man is none other than the leader of the village soviet. The village, as much of it as can be seen, appears to be a metropolis of about four igloos.So a plane goes to succor the leader, a dog-team sets out to look for tin, and the subsequent drama, aside from avalanches, forced landings, blizzards, &c., consists in the efforts of the two expeditions to keep in touch with the base and with each other by radio. The sled custodian redeems himself by saving the plane party, Letnikov is permitted to keep his job by carrying in his dying partner and making a modest report on the radio to a deistic Moscow. Then comes the doctor, and the final not-too-comradely kiss with which the Propaganda Ministry elects to pamper the people.The photography, taken under difficult, outdoor conditions, has a rugged distinction, but if you dislike propaganda, even when sugarcoated and in a dialectically good cause, \\"Seven Brave Men\\" is not the picture for you.

The source material is \\"Christ Stopped at Eboli,\\" Carlo Levi's memoir of his confinement as a political prisoner in a remote part of Italy in the mid-1930's. Francesco Rosi, the director, who illustrates the story more than he shapes it, limits his film entirely to the period of Mr. Levi's banishment and recalls incidents loosely and easily, without forcing them into place. For all the harshness of Mr. Levi's situation, there's a great deal of gentleness to the tale.Mr. Rosi takes a clearly compassionate attitude toward the entire episode of Mr. Levi's stay in Lucania, a tiny hilltop village in southern Italy. But the story's individual incidents are presented without comment, and sometimes without enough definition — this is a movie that repeatedly sends its audience back to the book on which it is modeled. The various episodes remain isolated from one another, however powerfully Mr. Rosi conveys a sense of place.In a closing voice-over, Levi (played by Gian Maria Volonte) departs from Lucania, saying that perhaps he has only been a clumsy observer in this desolate place. But he serves as a careful onlooker throughout much of the film, and his decorous manner helps set the mood. As the film begins, he disembarks from a train at the Eboli station and is carried, on a bus filled with peasant women and chickens, along the arduous route to Lucania. The village is situated at a kind of land's-end, in an eerie, beautiful spot that gives the film an understated drama. On one side of Lucania, there is a green, rolling landscape","excerpt":"these are the fields in which the peasants labor. The opposite vista is parched and eroded, virtually uninhabitable. Lucania, physically and culturally, is positioned at the very last outpost of livable terrain.A lot of the film is devoted to Mr. Levi's quietly watching the peasants' customs, as he wanders relatively freely through the town. (Two other prisoners, more controversial than he, are kept indoors and forbidden to speak to each other.) The people of Lucania happily accept him, because he is a trained physician in a place where love potions and curative coins are still taken seriously. Eventually, an edict forbidding him to practice medicine in the town is lifted and he becomes closely connected with the lives and welfare of those around them. He develops great fondness and respect for these people, especially since they illustrate, for him, the irrelevance of the state in general and Fascism in particular. The film ponders, at great length and less depth, the nature of the real Italy, because the men of Lucania seem to temper their patriotism with wanderlust. When the men of Lucania speak of loving Italy, they also speak about leaving it, even as their lives remain inextricably tied to the land.Mr. Volonte gives a calm, ghostly, very passive performance, as he observes characters like Irene Papas's sharp-eyed scrubwoman, who has been pregnant 17 times by about as many men. Miss Papas, who is hard at work as Mr. Levi's housekeeper during much of her performance, really sweats her way through the role. Lea Massari turns up briefly as Mr. Levi's sister, paying a visit that says as much as the movie offers about his genteel past. These elements don't entirely tie together, but they create a sharp impression.

At least weekly, vacuum or dust-mop floors to prevent dirt from getting ground in. Wipe up spills promptly. Clean soiled floors by sponge-mopping, using either a mild liquid detergent or a cleaning solution for vinyl floors recommended by the flooring manufacturer.   Cleaning solution is preferred for high-gloss floors or if water used for rinsing is hard. Such water causes spotting.   To remove built-up grime, detergents and cleaning solution can be fortified by adding a half-cup of ammonia per gallon or as specified on the label, provided the products do not contain bleach.    Mixing bleach and ammonia produces toxic fumes. Never use undiluted bleach or cleaners containing solvents or gritty abrasives","excerpt":"these can dull vinyl flooring or cause it to become yellow.   If applied properly, cleaning solution will remove most stains. If stronger measures are needed, try the following in order:    *Rub with a wet powdered cleanser containing a soft abrasive like Bon Ami. Do not use if the floor is high-gloss.   *Rub lightly with lighter fluid or mineral spirits.   *Rub lightly with a cloth dipped in a mixture of 10 parts water and one of liquid bleach.   To remove nail polish, rub lightly with a cloth dipped in nail polish remover. For rust or grass stains, rub with lemon juice.   Heavily used flooring may become dull, despite regular cleaning. To restore it, apply a liquid vinyl-floor finish recommended by the flooring manufacturer; different finishes are required for standard-gloss and high-gloss floors.   Apply finish in a thin coat and avoid creating puddles. Let the finish dry thoroughly (at least 30 minutes) before applying additional coats, if they are necessary.   After cleaning or applying a finish, standard gloss floors can be polished by using an electric floor polisher equipped with a lamb's wool buffing pad. Do not buff high-gloss floors; this can dull them. High-gloss floors damaged by buffing usually can be restored with a new coat of finish.   Vinyl flooring is easily torn. To prevent this, attach wide casters or glides of hard plastic to furniture legs and appliance bases. Do not use protectors made of rubber, as these can stain vinyl permanently.   To repair minor cuts or gouges in flooring, first wipe the area clean with a cloth dipped in mineral spirits. When dry, glue the surface material back together with seam sealer recommended for your flooring. Apply the sealer by using the applicator sold with it.   Areas with greater damage require patching. A diamond-shaped patch is usually the least noticeable, unless one can be made whose seams lie along dark-colored lines in the floor's design.   To make a patch, use either a piece of leftover flooring or take some from an inconspicuous spot, like the area beneath an appliance. Trim the piece so that it extends about an inch on all sides beyond the area of damaged flooring you plan to remove.    Place the patch on the floor over the damaged area and carefully align the designs. Next, tape the patch securely to the flooring with masking tape.   With a sharp utility knife, cut through the patch and the flooring along the lines chosen for the cutout. Use a metal straightedge as a guide and hold the knife so that the blade cuts perpendicular to the floor. Otherwise, the patch will fit poorly.   Remove the tape and the patch. If the damaged flooring is not cemented to the subfloor underneath, pry it out. Cut several strips of masking tape and, with the point of the knife, slide the sticky side up partly under the undamaged flooring on all sides of the opening.   Fit the patch into place and press the area with a rolling pin so that the patch and surrounding flooring adhere to the tape. Apply seam sealer to mend the cuts; after it dries, apply floor finish.   If the damaged flooring is cemented permanently to the subfloor, separate the smooth surface layer from the fibrous backing underneath and pull it away. Do the same with the patch, but avoid damaging the surface layer.   Next, apply vinyl-flooring adhesive sparingly to the back of the surface layer that will be the patch. Keep the adhesive from getting on the edges. Fit the patch into place on top of the exposed backing, then press the area with a rolling pin. Remove any oozing adhesive with a damp cloth.   Dry the area with a clean cloth and apply seam sealer, followed later by floor finish.   A third type of vinyl flooring is cemented to the subfloor, but can be pulled away.

I cannot comment on these statements except to note the following: I myself, together with my parents and sister, was saved by a gentile Dutch laborer who, though he hardly knew us before, hid us in his house in Veenendaal from August 1942 until liberation in April 1945. According to one account of the fate of the Dutch Jews I have read, about 20,000 of the 140,000 Jews in Holland were similarly hidden, of whom about 10,000 were discovered by the Nazis and deported.

It's also a sore point with Paul Green, whose Paul Green School of Rock Music is the subject of ''Rock School,'' a documentary by Don Argott. Here's a quick study guide for the School of Rock, ''School of Rock'' and ''Rock School.''    1997 -- Paul Green, a Philadelphia musician, convenes weekly jam sessions for his guitar students, which he calls Rock School after Herbie Hancock's public television series.    NOVEMBER 1998 -- As the Paul Green School of Rock Music, Mr. Green's students play a gig at a local art opening and go on to do shows around Philadelphia and New Jersey.    APRIL 2000 -- Spurred by news coverage, enrollment doubles to 40 students, prompting Mr. Green to lease a three-story town house for an after-school program.    APRIL 2002 -- Mr. Green registers www.schoolofrock.com. The next month, VH1 sends a crew to document the school for a reality series that never materializes.    JANUARY 2003 -- Intrigued by ubiquitous posters for rock school performances, Don Argott approaches Mr. Green about making a documentary. Filming begins that month.    APRIL 2003 -- Mr. Green learns from his students that Paramount, a corporate sibling of VH1, has begun production on ''School of Rock'' starring Jack Black.    SEPTEMBER 2003 -- A rough cut of ''Rock School'' plays at the Independent Feature Project festival in New York. ''School of Rock'' has its premiere the same week. Paramount and Mike White, who wrote the screenplay, deny any connection between their film and Mr. Green's story. ''Their denials were, 'Never heard of him,''' Mr. Green said. ''Come on.

Truesdale (New Rivers Press, 420 North Fifth Street, Minneapolis, Minn. 55401, paper).    To be fair: Our winter is a great beauty. At night, cascades of snowflakes cast tiny ghostly rainbows under the street lights","excerpt":"these prismatic arcs, hardly the width of a hand span, are bled pale except for a lunar aura of silvers and blues.   And each winter that lonely sound, first heard in childhood -- and understood even then -- returns with its uncompromised sadness: the rasp of skate blades cutting across a freshly flooded playground rink, saying,    solo, we are solo, solo, solo   .   Once experienced, these moments of winter beauty retain a gravity that causes them to    seem    like travel even though they occurred just down the block. They go into the album of foreign places where we have ventured, caught our tantalizing glimpse, and moved on. Learning to Become Invisible      To see wilderness stripped clean of sentiment or illusions, Rene Dubos writes, we should adopt the methods of accomplished hunters. This is from \\"The World of Rene Dubos: A Collection From His Writings,\\" edited by Gerard Piel and Osborn Segerberg Jr. (Holt).      They come to know almost instinctively the habits of the animals that interest them and how these habits are affected by the seasons, the vagaries of the weather, and other aspects of the environment. In    Meditations on Hunting   , Jose Ortega y Gasset reports how the hunter \\"instinctively shrinks from being seen\\" and \\"perceives all his surroundings from the point of view of the animal.\\" For the hunter, \\"wind, light, temperature, ground contour, minerals, vegetation, all play a part. They are not simply there . . . as they are for the tourist or the botanist, but rather they function, they act.\\" These words of Ortega's convey how human beings can still learn to function as organic parts of a given environment instead of simply observing it passively, as do most people when looking at scenery. History's Hidden Currents      John Clive argues that Alexis de Tocqueville, in his book \\"The Old Regime and the French Revolution,\\" raises a crucial, often overlooked, point for historians: not everything in a society is easily reduced to data or tidy theories. This is from \\"Not by Fact Alone: Essays on the Writing and Reading of History\\" (Houghton Mifflin, paper).      But . . . what seems most moving and instructive about his book is not its author's pioneering use of the methods of historical sociology, but the sense that the ultimate currents running deep below the surface of the lives of states and societies will not yield to scientific analysis, but will remain forever mysterious. In all human institutions, as in the human body, Tocqueville notes, \\"there is a hidden source of energy, the life principle itself, independent of the organs which perform the various functions needed for survival; once this vital flame burns low, the whole organism languishes and wastes away, and though the organs seem to function as before, they serve no useful purpose.\\" . . . Rarely has any historian applied his mind more vigorously to the detection of those ultimate forces. But he leaves us with the sense that, in the end, the body politic, like the human body, possesses mysteries it will not yield up. Shelley, Good and Bad      P. G. Wodehouse picked up a volume of Percy Shelley's work -- and the resulting collision of salty humorist and 19th-century Romantic poet was preserved in this letter to a friend. It is included in \\"Yours, Plum: The Letters of P. G. Wodehouse,\\" edited by Frances Donaldson (Heineman).      I have always liked \\"Epipsychidion\\" and \\"Ozymandias,\\" but last night I tackled \\"The Revolt of Islam\\" and it was like being beaten over the head with a sandbag. I'm afraid I've got one of those secondrate minds, because, while I realize that Shelley is in the Shakespeare and Milton class, I much prefer Tennyson, who isn't.   Incidentally, what lousy prose Shelley wrote. . . . \\"I have sought to enlist the harmony of metrical language, the ethereal combinations of the fancy, the rapid and subtle transitions of human passion, all those elements which essentially compose a Poem, in the cause of a liberal and comprehensive morality.\\" Block those double adjectives, Perce!   Why will people collect ALL a poet's work into a volume instead of burying the bad stuff? The Shy, Formal Poet      Eileen Simpson first met T. S. Eliot at a cocktail party she gave with her husband, the poet John Berryman, in 1948, just after Eliot had received the Nobel Prize in Literature. This anecdote is from \\"Poets in Their Youth: A Memoir\\" (Noonday/ Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paper).      The changes in his face brought about by age, the deep creases around his eyes, nose and mouth, were so much in the direction of its original character that at sixty he was recognizably the good-looking man with the slicked-down black hair (now graying) of the early photographs. His manner was as formal as his dress, the conservative dress of an English banker. Shyness had been disciplined into courtesy. . . . When John congratulated him on the prize, and added, \\"High time!\\" Eliot said, \\"Rather too soon. The Nobel is a ticket to one's own funeral. No one has ever done anything after he got it.\\" John protested: it was not so. \\"All of Yeats's great poetry was written after he received the award. Can't one therefore look on the prize as a recognition of promise?\\" Eliot was delighted and said, \\"That's how I shall try to look on it.\\" Noted With Pleasure"},{"year":"2003","title":"Analysis: Pres Bush faces major obstacles to his effort to secure and rebuild Iraq from United Nations, Congress, allied capitals and cities of Iraq itself","excerpt":"these problems complicate White House efforts to assure American public that situation in Iraq will actually improve with time (M) Rocky Path for Bush: Effort to Remake Iraq Hits Roadblocks"},{"year":"1940","title":"Studies war trade curbs WAR TRADE CURBS STUDIED","excerpt":"These Problems Leading Concern of Exporters, Queries Show"},{"year":"1997","title":"Asian financial crisis is helping drive down price of imports to US, with goods from South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore dropping by exceptionally strong 1.2 percent in November","excerpt":"these products account for 11 percent of all imports to US; Japan, whose products were three-tenths of 1 percent less costly last month, accounts for additional 17 percent; graphs (L) Asian Import Prices Plunge By Extremely Strong 1.2%"},{"year":"1998","title":"Warren Buffett's purchase of General Re Corp will give General Re's institutional shareholders 15 percent stake in his Berkshire Hathaway Inc","excerpt":"these professional investors, who have shunned company for which individual investors often pay premium, are more likely to ask pointed questions about Buffett's plans (M) THE MARKETS: Market Place; A question for Buffett: Will General Re's institutional holders fit in at Berkshire?"},{"year":"2000","title":"Hundreds of con artists prey on New York region's illegal immigrants, whose ignorance of legal system is matched by their desperation","excerpt":"these profiteers, who often pose as lawyers, close shop and move on to other cities once immigrants are fleeced; they frequently make $100,000 to $200,000 a year; bogus claims filed by con artists often keep immigrants' legitimate claims from being heard (M) Immigrants Seeking Help With I.N.S.

The show spends not a minute on ideological controversies surrounding this brave-new-world reproductive science -- the surrogates, egg transfers, sperm samples -- but there's something in it that's just too unstable to serve as a backdrop for primetime drama. Betrayal and vanity may suit the characters on ''Nip/Tuck,'' FX's marvelously creepy drama about plastic surgery. Around the delicate creation of human life, however, it's worth saying: more reverence is in order.      With its high style, capable writing and self-assured performances, ''Inconceivable'' asks that viewers accept the characters as familiar television professionals, but this turns out to be a tall order. The way these doctors tinker with procreation is just chronically unsettling.

But a relaxation of monetary controls by the United States, the bank says, must be accompanied by steps to prevent an upsurge in inflation","excerpt":"these steps should include cuts in the budget deficit and curbs on wage increases.   In addition, the B.I.S., often known as the ''central bankers' central bank'' because it is owned by the major Western central banks, wants the United States to intervene more actively on foreign exchange markets to stabalize the dollar and to encourage private banks to continue lending to the developing world.   The B.I.S.'s prescriptions for the United States, which apply to most other industrial countries too, are part of a general strategy for lowering interest rates and promoting economic recovery, without sacrificing the gains made in the fight against inflation.

That Schoenberg's music survives to be studied, performed, heard and appreciated, even in this day of mass-culture mongering (to which Mr. Henahan contributed his most fervent efforts), is some sort of miracle, and surely a thorn in the side of those who would prefer to remain uninformed by history and untroubled by thought.   It is a charming notion that audiences will and do    demand    certain types of music, and that the music they \\"demand\\" is therefore meaningful and expressive. In point of fact, there is little enough demand for serious music, atonal or otherwise. Audiences resist the unfamiliar -- as who does not? Education and the opportunity to listen (two things not provided by the process of cultural commodification and marketing) are the only hopes for any musical culture.  Mr. Henahan seems to equate serialism, atonality and the music of Schoenberg","excerpt":"these things are not synonymous. Regarding 12-tone composition itself, it is one of many compositional approaches used by 20th-century composers, and it has been used by some (including Berg, Copland and Stravinsky) as a means of expanding the expressive possibilities of the tonal realm. (Just as an aside, Mr. Henahan has our sympathy if all the meaning he is able to derive from \\"The Rite of Spring\\" and \\"The Miraculous Mandarin\\" is an impression of \\"motor rhythm.\\") Mr. Henahan repeatedly speaks of \\"severely atonal\\" music, leading one to wonder what might constitute a \\"lighter\\" atonality. Furthermore, does his objection to atonality extend farther back than the 20th century, including perhaps Gregorian chant and the music of Machaut and Josquin among its objects of scorn? Does he include all non-Western music as well?  It is shocking that Mr. Henahan uses his position merely to disseminate his prejudices. PAUL PACCIONE  MOLLY PACCIONE Macomb, Ill. Mr. Paccione is an associate professor of music composition at Western Illinois University, and Mrs. Paccione is the principal clarinet with the Quad-City Symphony Orchestra.   Mr. Henahan replies: What is so confusing? Schoenberg's 12-tone works purposely avoid a key feeling and are indeed atonal, despite his preferred description of them as \\"pantonal.\\" Serialism, a refinement of Schoenberg's method that was developed after World War II, includes his 12-tone works as well as those employing series of fewer pitch classes. When rigorously applied, Serialism deliberately results in the most \\"severe,\\" which is to say the least tonally oriented, variety of music. There are, of course, less rigorously constructed atonal pieces in which key centers, whether or not intended, may be detected for short or long periods. The term invented by the Pacciones, \\"lighter atonality,\\" is notbad.   The Pacciones seem to equate 20th-century music in which key centers are strictly avoided with the modal systems of early church music, in which gravitation toward a pitch center is almost always felt. Most listeners, I believe, easily detect the difference.

ROMANTIC, yet, in the poet's words, ''insanely clear,'' fanciful and nakedly down-to-earth, dreamy as well as diagnostic - these are just some of the paradoxical aspects of Gabriel Preil's poems. Yet the greatest paradox is that these lucid poems about New York and Maine, Fordham and Murray Hill, Williamsburg and Lincoln Center, are translations","excerpt":"these typically American poems were originally written in Hebrew - in the Bronx. In some sense this first bilingual edition of Mr. Preil's poems signifies the closing of a circle, the return ''home'' - to the English language and the American reader - of verse that not only was conceived on American soil, but is credited with modernizing the tradition of Hebrew verse by its own version of Anglo-American imagism.   While both the novelty of Mr. Preil's imagism and the surprisingly colloquial Hebrew he uses in forging it were lauded early on by Israeli critics, his unique role in the literary transfer from English and Yiddish to Hebrew has been only recently appreciated. Yet knowledge of such things is not a necessary condition for a pleasurable reading of ''Sunset Possibilities.''

They are not overcrowded - you won't find hordes of tourists laid out flank to flank, turning hot-dog color on the beach. These are not - for the most part - islands for people who want to stay in walled-off tourist ghettos. They are also not sleek or slick or chic or twee. They haven't been particularly reconstructed for the tourist trade, partly because the tourist trade is not dominant. Most of the people you will see on the streets roads or paths really live there.

Almost nothing can spoil what the author W.I.B. Beveridge called the ''great sense of well-being and satisfaction'' that comes from ''the thrill of discovery.''   And here discovery cuts across many disciplines. Engineers tinker with electronic switches and telephone circuts, while astrophysicists look for the origin of the universe. There are biochemists, mathematicians, psychologists and ''computer jocks,'' too, and a legion of clerks and paper pushers to remind everyone that this is, after all, a corporation and no one takes a vacation without filling out the right form.   Still, it is a peculiar place where people talk in tongues and an eavsedropper might hear one scientist telling another, ''It's a question of finding the increase in vicosity as against an increase in cross-linking, so we have to skin it.''

If only France, without Britain (which had some excellent combat divisions), had attacked the aggressor, there would have remained no trace of Nazi German power and a war which, in three years, changed the whole of human history, would have been prevented.

Personally, I wouldn't have called the catastrophic events that concluded the immediately preceding novel all that casual. Enderby had opened his apartment door in New York City, where he'd been doing a stint of teaching as a result of having been connected with a scandalous film version of Gerard Manley Hopkins's ''The Wreck of the Deutschland,'' to find himself toe to toe with yet another of the gift-women his author so freely bestows on him.

A methodical portrait of the great chief of MCA, a secretive mogul whose vindictiveness and cunning matched his shrewdness and prescience.    WHEELS FOR THE WORLD: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress, 1903-2003, by Douglas Brinkley. (Viking, $34.95.) A mighty, sprawling narrative synthesis focused on the family, especially Henry I, an American original who knew how to get people to do what he wanted done.    LOST IN A GOOD BOOK, by Jasper Fforde. (Viking, $24.95.) An effortlessly readable, shamelessly conceptual novel starring Fforde's literary detective Thursday Next, who employs a time-transcending thingummy to penetrate the text of Poe's ''Raven'' and do literary business of the utmost importance for the future of the world itself.    AUTO DA FAY, by Fay Weldon. (Grove, $25.) The author of a couple of dozen novels in breezy prose pauses to tell her own story, in which an intrepid, no-nonsense woman survives paternal abandonment, earthquake, World War II and a long heritage of dotty ancestors, many of whom were compulsive scribblers of novels, stories and movie scripts.    THE COMPANY YOU KEEP, by Neil Gordon. (Viking, $25.95.) A rousing, cerebral thriller in which Woodstock Nation meets Islamic fundamentalism; the action, most of it set in 1996, concerns a left-wing lawyer from the 60's who kidnaps his daughter to avoid her mother's custody suit, then has to explain (in 2006) why he abandoned her a decade before.

In this novel by a Spanish writer preoccupied with the erotic imagination, a tenor and his paramour are together for a while and then they're not.

Dail.\\n378 pp. New York: A Thomas Dunne Book/St. Martin's Press. $22.95\\n\\n The \\"four hands\\" in the title of Paco Ignacio Taibo 2d's novel belong to his characters Greg Simon and Julio Fernandez, a team of freelance journalists who cover an international, mostly Latin American beat. Writing with four hands and in two languages for the world's left-leaning press, they are journalists of the old romantic, revolutionary kind, a la John Reed. But their human foibles reflect the fallen world they live in: they are unlucky in love, engagingly neurotic and inclined to bicker like an old married couple. In their physical appearance (the Mexican Julio is fat, the American Greg is slight), their hapless personal lives and their secret devotion to each other, they resemble no one so much as Laurel and Hardy -- of whose films, incidentally, Julio is a passionate devotee.\\n\\n Greg and Julio tell fragments of their story (set in the late 1980's) against a narrative that rambles agreeably across decades and continents, assembling as it goes a collection of very odd characters, who enter in various ways into the great political dramas of the 209th century (including Stan Laurel himself, who, during a boozy sojourn south of the border, witnesses Pancho Villa's murder). Octogenarian veterans of the International Brigades of the Spanish Civil War, Mexican drug traffickers, Nicaraguan revolutionaries, C.I.A. flunkies -- their lives are evoked in astonishing detail. As the novel progresses, these lives come together","excerpt":"they all become entangled in a nasty C.I.A. scheme to discredit the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua by implicating one of its heroes in a staged murder and a phony drug racket.\\n\\n Despite its intricate plotting, \\"Four Hands,\\" now translated by Laura C. Dail, is not exactly a taut political thriller. Perhaps because Mr. Taibo is a historian and journalist (as well as a best-selling novelist in Mexico), the novel seems to contain the contents of a couple of messy file drawers assembled by an intellectual with a love for humanity, popular culture, good jokes and the romantic history of the left. Those who don't mind rummaging rather than racing through a novel will enjoy the digressive chapters about Houdini's psychiatric sessions (with Greg's grandfather as the shrink), the reimagined fragments of one of Emilio Salgari's \\"Tigers of Malaysia\\" adverture yarns and the working drafts of a lost novel by Leon Trotsky written in his Mexico period. This is a novel you want to put down -- to go to the library and look things up. Deciding when Mr. Taibo is pulling your leg is one of the amusing challenges of reading it.\\n\\n When it comes to making its political points, however, \\"Four Hands\\" is deadly serious. In Alex, the C.I.A. spook who has constructed the anti-Sandinista plot (\\"Operation Snow White\\"), Mr. Taibo creates a loathsome, chilling and (unfortunately) plausible figure. The operatives whom Alex gathers (with approriate Disneyesque code names) to bring \\"Snow White\\" to fruition are evil in their professional detachment from the reality of what they do. The novel offers an indictment of American foreign policy at its seamiest, and undoubedly will be hard to take for American readers with warm memories of the Reagan-Bush era and clear consciences about the historical role of the United States in this hemisphere.\\n\\n But, as one of the novel's old Spanish Civil War veterans observes, C.I.A. spooks are just the most recent generation of \\"them\\" -- that is, \\"the legion of demons who, for the last 70 years, had been on the other side of the barricade.\\" In Mr. Taibo's novel, good and evil transcend nationality: some of the most sympathetic and beautifully drawn of his characters are Americans. There is Max Lewis, a sad and sensitive veteran of the International Brigades; the young Benjamin Linder, a martyr to the Sandinista cause; and, especially, the sardonic and thoroughly decent Greg. They share more than their political leanings with the novel's other good guys: they are wary innocents in a world that has wounded or sidelined them, but not taken away their capacity for wistful love.\\n\\n That love crosses linguistic and national frontiers and binds together the novel's many pairs of friends. Stan Laurel meets and befriends Julio's grandsfather, an old Spanish leftist, in a forgotten Baja California town; the only language they share is the universal one of sympathy. A pair of veterans of the International Brigades emerge from senescent obscurity to take up the good fight in a new time and place, and to renew a friendship forged half a century earlier in wartime Spain. In the novel within the novel, two old Tigers of Malaysia (A Malaysian and a Portuguese) swashbuckle together across Asian seas in defiance of European imperalists.\\n\\n Above all, the friendship of Greg and Julio radiates with a rough and happy affection. Their cross-cultural teasing reflects a mutual tolerance of human frailty, and their four-handed journalism comes straight from a single mind and heart; the two men are one in their abhorrence of injustice and their passion for the truth. For all of its undisciplined sprawl, its pop culture sensibilities and its tone of disenchantment, Mr. Taibo's novel soars, in its best moments, with conviction, fraternal love and the old-fashion lyrical idealism of lost leftist causes.

And there are some memorable one-liners. For example, here's Brooklyn Dodger Manager Charlie Dressen: \\"Just hold them for a few innings, fellas. I'll think of something.\\" Umpire Bill Klem: \\"It ain't nothin' till I call it.\\" Mickey Mantle: \\"All I have is natural ability.\\" Ernie's another natural, with a plaque in the Baseball Hall of Fame. His first major-league broadcast was a Dodgers-Cubs game at Ebbets Field on Aug. 4, 1948, when he filled in for Red Barber. Since then Ernie has broadcast for the New York Giants, the Baltimore Orioles and, since 1960, the Detroit Tigers. What no one can understand is why the Tigers' management is cutting Ernie loose following the 1991 season. Are they nuts? No one in baseball does a better play-by-play. They expected criticism, but not the blast they got from fans all over the country. One theory holds that the Tigers management wants to jazz up the team's image and feels that Ernie, at the age of 73, has become old hat. They see the Detroit Pistons raking it in at their suburban Palace, entertaining a full house at every basketball game with rap music and light shows, and they think, yeah, that's the way to go. What the Tiger bosses must fail to realize is that baseball moves at a much different tempo. Rather than razzle-dazzle, it's heavy on tradition, nostalgia, stats comparing new stars with the old greats. It has a sense of humor and an image epitomized by Ernie Harwell and his comfortable down-home Georgia delivery. What makes baseball so popular is what \\"Ernie Harwell's Diamond Gems\\" is about: the kind of stuff fans love to read and talk about, presented by a guy you can listen to all night. If we didn't have a written language, I think Ernie Harwell would be known as one of our great tribal storytellers -- if he isn't already.

Then one day Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) walks in -- blond, beautiful and determined to be a news anchor despite her sex. Rising above their initial disdain for each other, the two end up in bed and in love. But one day Ron is late for the broadcast (an angry biker threw his dog over a bridge) and Veronica goes on.

Cecil Kellaway plays Nick Smith, a quiet, middle-aged gas station/restaurant owner in the middle of nowhere. Lana Turner, almost a decade into her career as Hollywood's ''sweater girl,'' plays his much younger wife, Cora, who runs around in shorts, practically bursting with pent-up sexual need. What can the oblivious Nick possibly be thinking when he hires Frank Chambers, who looks and smolders like John Garfield (right with Turner), as a live-in handyman? Predictably for this genre, Cora and Frank are soon having a torrid affair and considering the possibility of Nick's untimely death.

It is a surprise, then, to discover that the fifth-rated place to live in the United States is Raleigh-Durham in North Carolina. This is a metropolitan area whose largest city, Raleigh, has only about 230,000 people; Durham is even smaller, with fewer than 150,000. Yet little Raleigh-Durham is hot: in 1992, Inc. magazine rated it as one of \\"the best places in the country to own a business,\\" and last year, Money magazine gave it the coveted No. 1 spot in its \\"best places to live in America\\" issue.   The runners-up to Raleigh-Durham as Money's best places to live were Rochester, Minn., and Provo-Orem, Utah. All three are small-to-midsize regional centers that share several characteristics other than their size. They score high in that ephemeral but crucial category, \\"quality of life.\\" They are near recreational resources like lakes and mountains. They have strong local economies and have lower unemployment, poverty and crime rates than the national average. But Raleigh-Durham, Rochester and Provo-Orem are not merely examples of successful small cities. They are also examples of a new urban trend: the rise of what might be called the college city.   The college town is an American institution. Throughout the 19th century, it was common practice to locate private colleges in small towns like Amherst in Massachusetts, Middlebury in Vermont and Pomona in California. The idea was that bucolic surroundings would provide the appropriate atmosphere for the pursuit of learning and (not incidentally) remove students from the distractions and temptations of the big city. The influence of the small college on its town was minimal, however, beyond providing a few local residents with service jobs.    THE COLLEGE CITY IS ALTOGETHER different. At its heart is a large research university. In the case of Raleigh-Durham, there are actually three: Duke in Durham, North Carolina State in Raleigh and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, just down the road. (Provo has Brigham Young University and Rochester has the Mayo Clinic, which runs a graduate school.) Not only are modern research universities vast undertakings -- the three North Carolina universities have about 60,000 students among them -- but they also act as magnets for private enterprise, attracting industries that provide well-paying jobs in the high-tech and medical fields. For example, the 6,800-acre Research Triangle Park outside Raleigh is now home to more than 80 research enterprises that employ about 35,000 people.   It's not just jobs that lure people to these places. Simply put, life in most smaller cities is cheaper. A family moving from the metropolitan area of a large city like Philadelphia, say, to Raleigh-Durham would need considerably less income -- about 30 percent less -- to maintain the same standard of living. The savings come chiefly in the form of lower housing prices and property taxes as well as lower state and local taxes.    IN THE PAST, A LOWER COST OF LIVING Usually translated into a lower standard of living. Life in small cities -- with or without colleges -- may have been cheaper but it was also restricted in terms of entertainment, shopping and recreation. Today, VCR's, sports channels, cineplexes, clothing and housewares catalogues, national distribution chains and the Internet have changed that. You don't have to travel to Manhattan any more to shop at Bloomingdale's -- all you need to do is go down to the mall or call an 800 number. This is more than merely a matter of convenience. It means that small cities can offer many, if not all, of the everyday services and amenities that used to be the exclusive province of the metropolis.   Where people live has always been influenced by technology. Once, the seaport, the railroad and the huge factory complex encouraged concentration in large cities. Truck transport and the automobile have had the opposite effect; so have the deregulation of airplane travel and telecommunications. Generally speaking, recent technological developments like cellular telephones, cable television, personal computers and fax machines have all supported dispersal. Indeed, it is difficult to think of a single invention in the past 50 years that has not been inspired by the desire to make modern life more decentralized.   The forces of decentralization account for much of the appeal of the college city. For example, the largest cities -- New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston -- traditionally have had the most sophisticated hospitals. The decentralization of medical skills now means that a regional medical center, like the one affiliated with Duke University, can provide worldclass health care. Another appeal of a college city is the access to continuing education, not only for people in midcareer, but especially for retirees. Mild climates and golf courses used to be the main attractions in retirement communities, but college cities, with their high-quality athletic programs, their university drama and music departments and their art galleries and museums offer a variety of diversions not available in most cities of comparable size. Life in a college city, whether it is Raleigh-Durham, Santa Cruz, Calif., or Charlottesville, Va., can be as cosmopolitan as it is in larger cities. The list of college cities is long and growing longer: Madison, Wis.; Ann Arbor, Mich.; San Luis Obispo, Calif.; Eugene, Ore.; Austin, Tex.; Bloomington, Ind.; Boulder, Colo.; Iowa City, Iowa, and Lawrence, Kan., are some examples.   The college city I know best is Burlington, Vt. This little city is in the foothills of the Green Mountains and on the shore of Lake Champlain. (Burlington itself has a population of less than 40,000 while the metropolitan area has about 157,000 people.) The setting is as idyllic as it sounds. Undoubtedly, it was the unspoiled surroundings and the recreational opportunities that drew many newcomers here during the 1960's and 70's. Burlington became a destination for those who wanted to escape big cities but were not quite ready for a dropout's life on a farm or in a commune. (The rest of Vermont offered those alternatives, too.) Burlington also attracted young professionals and entrepreneurs who were looking for a low-key urban life. The city's most famous success story of that era is Ben & Jerry's, whose first ice cream parlor was located in an abandoned service station downtown. High-tech corporations also found Burlington congenial, and I.B.M. and Digital Equipment Corporation established plants in the area. While not quite in the same league as booming Raleigh-Durham, Burlington exhibits many of the amenities of the larger college city: a busy regional airport and university medical center, growing white-collar employment and a beautiful environment.    I used to live close to Burlington, right over the Canadian border. My wife and I would frequently make the 90-minute drive, sometimes to shop, sometimes to visit the nearby Shelburne Museum -- an extraordinary collection of historic buildings and artifacts -- and sometimes to go boating on Lake Champlain. But most often we would go with no particular aim in mind, just to stroll the streets.   We would usually end up on Church Street, where a legacy of that urban design fad of the 70's still exists: the main street converted into a pedestrian mall. The malls of that period were usually a last-ditch effort to resuscitate declining downtowns; today, with their crumbling planters and unpainted benches, most downtowns are deserted. Church Street is an exception: it's a busy and thriving thoroughfare crowded with adults, children and dogs. There are sidewalk vendors, several good bookstores, an art supply store, the inevitable Banana Republic, a number of restaurants and bistros and cafes -- a veritable Green Mountain St.-Germain-des-Pres.    EXAGGERATE, BUT THERE IS AT LEAST one real similarity to Paris's Latin Quarter: the place is teeming with students. (There are about 15,000 of them in Burlington, enrolled at the University of Vermont and at four other colleges.) The presence of so many young people may be one of the secrets to the success of college cities like Burlington. College students are generally bright, healthy, social and usually unencumbered by serious financial worries. They typically don't have large, comfortable homes to retreat to -- or families to take care of -- and so they tend to inhabit the public realm. At night, students are out and about; downtown Burlington has two independently owned cinemas as well as a renovated theater. Although some might complain that students, by their nature, can be bothersome, they contribute a vital ingredient to urban life. Unlike their career-crazed elders, college students really do have the time to sit in a cafe or dawdle on the village green, which is why many college cities have retained the vibrant kind of public street life that was once characteristic of larger cities. Who would have thought that the ivory tower would nurture that precious but rapidly disappearing commodity: civilized city life. Big-City Amenities. Trees. High-Tech Jobs. Cappuccino.
