Among them, no doubt, one may include George Raft, currently making a sentimental journey into his own past—or reasonable facsimile thereof—in \\"Broadway\\" at the Capitol. Mr. Raft was an ambitious local hoofer in those roaring years of cuties who looked like blondes but weren't, of hooch which was called Scotch but wasn't, of gangsters who looked like gorillas in evening dress but weren't, and of butter-and-egg men who were greeted as \\"suckers\\" and were. Times Square to Mr. Raft is what Grovers Corners is to Thornton Wilder, with slight alterations of course.Because those years were feverish, if anything, Mr. Raft's remembrance of things past makes a fair-to-middling melodrama. After a brief glimpse of the present sharp and prosperous Mr. Raft returning to New York from his Hollywood triumphs, a flashback carries him to one eventful night at the old Paradise where the barrels were rolled in the back door and bodies went out the same way. Perhaps what happens belongs more to the original script of the play, \\"Broadway,\\" than to Mr. Raft's experience, but no matter—he is more than ordinarily convincing as the hopeful hoofer working toward the bigtime despite frame-ups, shootings or the attempt of a tough bootlegger to steal his partner.Director William A. Seiter has done his bit to accent the nostalgia. Carefully he has recorded the backroom parties where the chorus girls were entertained raucously by the visiting Chicago mob, he has let the camera linger on dressing room brawls and backstage blues. And the actors help. Pat O'Brien recreates beautifully the role of the roving detective, which he performed in the original play","excerpt":"Broderick Crawford draws a tight portrait of an oily killer, and Janet Blair, as the dancing partner, has a personality that flashes like a neon sign after a test blackout. In lesser roles Marjorie Rambeau, Anne Gwynne and S. Z. Sakall give commendable performances. If \\"Broadway\\" no longer has the impact of the original play, it still affords an interesting Cook's tour of an unsavory decade—with Mr. Raft, of course, as the knowing guide.
