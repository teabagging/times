The city, always enhanced by the harbor's deep blue, is further brightened with the colors of wattle, jacaranda and flame trees in bloom. The harbor comes alive with fleets of striped spinnakers and windsurfers dancing from bay to bay. Beaches, quiet and dignified in the autumn and winter (March through August), turn to festival grounds full of boisterous sunbathers and surfers. They arrive in hordes, many in neon bathing suits with matching zinc sunblock on their noses. Broad strips of pristine white sand are patterned with beach towels from the promenade to the water's edge. \\n\\nToday, Australia Day, celebrates the arrival of the first European settlers, at Sydney on Jan. 26, 1788. This is usually the peak of summer festivities, the carefree hoopla dying down as children return to school and holidaymakers trudge back to the office in February. But this year -- the 150th anniversary of the city -- Sydneysiders intend to keep on celebrating right through December. Between 1788, when Capt. Arthur Phillip moored off Sydney Cove with the first fleet of convicts, and 1842, when Britain first granted the city a right to representative government, Sydney was considered nothing more than a rough colonial outpost. With the establishment of a partially elected legislative council, Sydney was on its way to becoming more than a dumping ground for England's outcasts.

The moderately sized ship provided a compact backdrop for the features that mean the most in a cruise, and for shore trips enhanced by glorious fall foliage.   The cruise essentials were all there -- vast quantities of food, good service, enjoyable if unremarkable entertainment and the inevitable gambling. The difference in this cruise was twofold -- the ambiance, best described as cozy rather than elegant, and the passengers themselves. Seven days in late October cruising on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Atlantic Ocean and Cape Cod waters, even with visits to historic sites and the burnished colors of fall leaves, isn't everyone's cup of hot bouillon, but it sold out the ship.

Determination, of course, is not sufficient reason to keep an orchestra with a $17 million budget afloat. But at its Carnegie Hall concert on Monday evening, the musicians showed that what is at stake is a first-class ensemble with a sound that is impressively polished and warm. Its lower strings, in particular, provided a rich, glowing foundation in Arvo Part's ruminative \\"Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten.\\" And the transparency of the wind and brass playing gave the last two movements of the Ives First Symphony an alluringly springy, Romantic sound.   The orchestra was conducted by Neeme Jarvi, who is now in his second season as its music director. Mr. Jarvi is not a flashy conductor, but his gestures are clear and expressive, and sweeping when they need to be.
